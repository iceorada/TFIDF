<HD>All-American crop at Descanso Gardens: corn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>This learning link was provided by Descanso Gardens.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With its tall stalks, long green leaves and tasseled ears, corn is an
impressive sight in a field or garden. It is delicious in soup and
can be ground into meal for tortillas, tamales and cornbread.
Corn-on-the-cob is fun to eat, and almost everyone loves popcorn. But
did you know that corn is a true all-American crop?</LD>
<LD>   People in the Americas have been eating corn for 7,000 years.
Christopher Columbus found corn when he came to America in 1492 and
took it back with him to Europe.</LD>
<LD>   Regular corn contains soft starch, so the kernels stay plump when
cooked. Popcorn kernels are different. They have a hard skin or
shell. When they are heated, steam gets trapped inside the kernels
and the starch expands until it explodes through the shell, becoming
a crunchy, fluffy-looking treat.</LD>
<TE>   Today corn is grown as a crop in more than 25 states and is found
in home gardens throughout the country. Corn grows well in Southern
California and is a favorite crop with students at Descanso Gardens'
Horticultural Therapy Center. They grow it from seed, harvest it,
cook it and use it in crafts. They turn cornhusks and the hair-like
silk inside the husks into dolls and other crafts.</TE>
<TE>   You can see corn -- the all-American crop -- as part of a special
autumn display at Descanso Gardens, 1418 Descanso Drive, La Canada
Flintridge. For more information call (818) 949-4200 or visit
www.descanso gardens.org.</TE>

<HD>'Harley's Homework'</HD>
<DH>The story so far: Harley's grandmother told him that if he
could draw a circle and a square, he could draw anything.</DH>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gramma and I went into her kitchen and she brought out a tray with a
big pitcher of lemonade on it and a plate of her special lemon bars.
I was munching on my second lemon bar when I asked.</LD>
<LD>   "I still don't know what you mean, Gramma, what you said about
drawing circles and squares and having that be a picture."</LD>
<LD>   Gramma said. "Just use your eyes, Harley. Take this table for
example. What shape is the top?"</LD>
<TE>   I scrunched my eyes and took a good look. "It's round," I said.
Then I opened my eyes wide. "It's a big circle!"</TE>
<TE>   "Bingo!" said Gramma.</TE>
<TE>   I jumped to my feet. "You mean if I draw a circle and add some
sticks for legs, I can draw a table! Wow!"</TE>
<TE>   I looked down and pointed to the tray. "That's a square, isn't it?
And the pitcher is just a circle with a handle sticking out on one
side."</TE>
<TE>   "Now you're cooking!" chortled Gramma. "What's more, if you
stretch a square out at one end, you make a rectangle, and if you cut
a square crosswise from corner to corner you get two triangles. Think
of all the things you can draw now!"</TE>
<TE>   I began looking around the room. I could see circles and squares,
rectangles and triangles everywhere: windows and doors, the rug on
the floor. My chair had a circle for a seat and a square for a back.
Even the lemon bars, I saw, were just squares cut crosswise from
corner to corner into triangles.</TE>
<TE>   I had another lemon bar or two before I ran home. I couldn't wait
to have dinner cleared away so we could start homework time! At last
I knew just what I was going to draw!</TE>

<LD>DANCE</LD>
<LD>   Rara avis on its toes</LD>
<LD>   Don't expect toe shoes and lyric elegance in the Cullberg Ballet
version of "Swan Lake." Founded in 1967, this groundbreaking Swedish
ensemble's barefoot, bald, contorted and irrepressibly twitchy
retelling of classical ballet's enduring swan fable won't endear the
company to traditionalists. Those with a taste for adventure,
however, will find Mats Ek's idiosyncratic choreography and bold
reworking of the plot infinitely livelier than many conventional
versions. With its coed swan corps, startling detours from the
familiar Tchaikovsky score (including a Jewish dance) and highly
individual perspective on the search for a pure, ideal mate, this is
one production every "Swan" collector will remember.</LD>
<TE>   Cullberg Ballet in "Swan Lake," Royce Hall, UCLA campus, Westwood.
Friday and Saturday, 8 p.m. $15 (students) to $45. (310) 825-2101.</TE>

<TE>   He's no hero</TE>
<TE>   Paul Schrader has inflicted on us some fairly twisted individuals
in the films he has written and/or directed, including "Taxi Driver,"
"Mishima" and "Affliction." But in some ways, they are no match for
the Bob Crane of "Auto Focus." The life of the former "Hogan's
Heroes" star, played by Greg Kinnear, begins with squeaky-clean
temperance but deteriorates into the dual depravity of homemade porn
and dinner theater.</TE>
<TE>   "Auto Focus," rated R for strong sexuality, nudity, language, some
drug use and violence, opens Friday in selected theaters.</TE>
<TE>   EVENTS</TE>
<TE>   Gathering of crafty types</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena Heritage will stage its 11th annual Craftsman Weekend,
the largest and most comprehensive celebration of the Craftsman
movement in the Western U.S. Festivities include a tour of six
significant Craftsman-style houses, plus exhibits by antique dealers
specializing in the Arts and Crafts movement, modern craftsmen
working in the period style, restoration workshops, lectures by
prominent Craftsman movement experts and special evening events at
historic sites.</TE>
<TE>   2002 Craftsman Weekend, call Pasadena Heritage for complete

in a Balloon" and Carl Maria von Weber's delicious Second Clarinet
Concerto, with soloist Lucy Chuang.</TE>

presented on the Segerstrom Stage, the former main stage that has
been extensively renovated. Shaw's comedy about an arms manufacturer
in a battle of wits with his eldest daughter, who's appalled by his
"munitions over morals" philosophy, stars Dakin Matthews, Nike Doukas
and Kandis Chappell. It's directed by Martin Benson, SCR's artistic
director.</TE>

<TE>   ART</TE>
<TE>   Art on the walls</TE>
<TE>   Along with Diego Rivera and Jose Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro
Siqueiros is known as one of the Big Three leaders of the Mexican
mural movement. He was also a committed revolutionary and communist,
an artist who believed that his murals should further the struggle of
the people. Expelled from Mexico in 1932 for political activity,
Siqueiros settled in Los Angeles briefly, completing three murals
during his stay. The first was gone a year after it appeared. The
second was whitewashed by shocked civic boosters. The last mural has
been moved from Pacific Palisades to the Santa Barbara Museum of Art,
where it was restored. The unveiling will be Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   David Alfaro Siqueiros' "Portrait of Mexico Today (1932)" will be
unveiled at a ceremony Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m. at the Santa Barbara
Museum of Art, 1130 State St., Santa Barbara. Museum hours:
Tuesdays-Saturdays, 11 a.m.-5 p.m. (Fridays until 9 p.m.); Sundays,
noon-5 p.m. $7; seniors, $5; students, $4; children 6 to 17, $4;
children under 6, free. (805) 963-4364.</TE>

<TE>   A Sunday forever stained</TE>
<TE>   To the strains of U2 and in memory of those who died, Paul
Greengrass wrote and directed "Bloody Sunday," a chronicle of the
events of Jan. 30, 1972, when 27 civilians were shot by the British
army during a peaceful march. The repercussions have fueled "the
troubles" in Northern Ireland. The drama, featuring James Nesbitt,
Tim-Pigott Smith, Nicholas Farrell and Gerald McSorley, is based on
Don Mullan's book, "Eyewitness Bloody Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   "Bloody Sunday," rated R for violence and language, opens Friday
in selected theaters.</TE>

<HD>Out of earshot</HD>
<DH>Nearly a hit with the youth crowd, L.A. Opera missed a good
opportunity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Timberg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>COMPARED with what I remember from a few years ago, when opera chic
was in the air, there's less talk in my circle about the opera these
days. Last year, my date and I were at an Oscar party when we had to
leave to catch "The Magic Flute" at Los Angeles Opera. People
shrugged their shoulders. What's with him? It felt like a
generational betrayal.</LD>
<LD>   But I wasn't entirely alone in my interest. Opera had been, when I
moved to town in '97, that rare high art that drew the under-30 crowd
-- something that stood out in a city where the audiences for high
and pop culture were more fiercely segregated than anywhere I'd
lived. Buzz magazine even suggested the opera was replacing the
Dresden Room as a retro pleasure. But by 2002, I see fewer young
faces.</LD>
<LD>   Did opera turn out to be another pop-cult fad, or did the L.A.
company blow the opportunity to capture this most sought-after
demographic?</LD>
<TE>   Lacking the mass audience, and the advertising and visibility that
huge budgets bring, the high arts will never be able to compete with
movies and TV, especially in Los Angeles. Here, there's a sense that
the traditional arts are stuffy, old; they're associated with that
fading WASP class Angelenos love to hate. So a televised movie awards
show with stars in slinky gowns is like a double-barreled culture
killer: It's entertainment about entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   But opera should connect with young people. Unlike the more
cerebral and abstract medium of classical music, it hits young 'uns
where they live: sex, violence, loud singing. It's a blood-and-guts
spectacle.</TE>
<TE>   A night at the opera can't be as cheap, or as easy, as a trip to
Spaceland. But it can offer something different, and the Los Angeles
company could, without pandering with cheesy operas based on
Hollywood films, do better.</TE>
<TE>   The opera's programming has budged little since Placido Domingo
took over and principal conductor Kent Nagano was appointed almost
two years ago, though it has exploited his cool haircut and sublime
way with Wagner.</TE>
<TE>   Nagano made his reputation with risky 20th century works;
virtually none of these have found their way onto our stage.
Adventurous productions of war horses, another way to draw new
audiences, have been sparing as well.</TE>
<TE>   And the greater ambition of the opera company under Domingo has
made tickets forbiddingly expensive, especially for those of us with
minimum-wage jobs still in memory.</TE>
<TE>   Some of what's wrong with the experience isn't exactly the L.A.
company's fault. The Music Center, for instance, needs a better bar
than Otto's, an overpriced corporate watering hole. (The fact that
young-member events take place a bus ride away attests to this.)</TE>
<TE>   The lack of any real street life or restaurants, except for the
Stalinist central planning of the Patina chain, gives Grand Avenue an
airless, artificial feel: Only if the show's great does this add up
to a romantic night out.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, the Grove is a wonder of diversity. Music Center
parking is now $8 a car, and there are few other options.</TE>
<TE>   For all the cheery talk about Los Angeles as a city where high
culture is fusing with low, art with pop, the opera's current season
remains, in comparison, monochromatic.</TE>
<TE>   Next week's opera, "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk," is a step in the
right direction, a rarely performed piece with intense, often violent
music by Shostakovich that speaks to our time.</TE>
<TE>   A great opera production fuses the genres with a visual,
emotional, narrative and harmonic power that nothing else can match,
with a physical presence that cinema can't offer.</TE>
<TE>   Consumerism, bad education and TV have marginalized the high arts
and standardized audiences, but opera -- which once had a popular
following in Italy, New York and elsewhere--may be the best suited to
fight back.</TE>

<HD>An act of rejuvenation</HD>
<DH>Bob Dylan reopens the Wiltern with a concert that is both
thrilling and generous.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most recording artists need new albums or MTV appearances to help
plug their live dates, but Bob Dylan has his own personal army of
promotion men that keeps his name in front of us.</LD>
<LD>   Whether it's U2 and Bruce Springsteen or such exciting young
talents as the White Stripes' Jack White and Bright Eyes' Conor
Oberst, there are constant reminders, by Dylan's influence on these
artists' work, of the importance of the man who revolutionized rock
'n' roll songwriting in the '60s.</LD>
<LD>   So, it's all the more exhilarating when Dylan demonstrates that he
can still deliver music with as much vitality and passion as any of
those descendants -- and that's what he did Tuesday in a two-hour
concert blessed with both thrilling music and a generous spirit.</LD>
<TE>   In the process, the veteran proved the ideal act to reopen the
historic Wiltern Theatre after a $1.5-million makeover.</TE>
<TE>   For those who enjoyed the sedate nature of the 71-year-old
Wiltern, it was unsettling last spring to learn that the theater
seats on the main floor were going to be ripped out. But the freedom
of fans to move about in the resulting open space contributed Tuesday
to an energy and intensity level in the room that wasn't possible
before.</TE>
<TE>   The ornate beauty of the building, which was declared a
historic-cultural monument by the city in 1973, has been preserved,
and the sound remains superior. For fans who prefer to sit, the
balcony seats remain.</TE>
<TE>   Dylan has gone through a rejuvenating process himself. After years
of artistic drift, he regained his purpose in the late '90s -- first
songwriting in "Time Out of Mind," the stark, Grammy-winning 1997 CD,
and the sheer love of musicmaking in "Love and Theft," his equally
memorable 2001 album.</TE>
<TE>   Whether cruising through the exuberant jump-blues of "Summer Days"
or the stinging, guitar-driven "Honest With Me," Dylan exhibited a
new freedom and openness on "Love and Theft," and he brought both
qualities to the stage Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Although he slipped in some acoustic numbers (including "Don't
Think Twice, It's All Right" and an especially reflective "I Shall Be
Released"), the emphasis was on whiplash urgency. Dylan, who normally
restricts himself to guitar, played electric piano on several
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a black jacket and pants, both striped in red, Dylan stood
at the keyboard with a gunslinger's swagger as he led his
well-drilled band through some of his own musical back pages
("Tombstone Blues," "Knockin' on Heaven's Door") and songs from other
writers.</TE>
<TE>   The latter ranged from Don Henley and Bruce Hornsby's absorbing
"The End of the Innocence," a well-timed choice in light of the
anxious geopolitics of this age, to Warren Zevon's "Mutineer" -- a
sweet sign of affection and respect for the acclaimed
singer-songwriter, who is suffering from a terminal illness.</TE>
<TE>   The most surprising choice was the Rolling Stones' lustful "Brown
Sugar," so dynamic that you'd have sworn Keith Richards himself had
sneaked on stage to deliver a few guitar licks.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, Dylan's band is such a versatile and explosive unit
that it seems capable of following its leader anywhere. Guitarists
Larry Campbell and Charlie Sexton, bassist Tony Garnier and drummer
David Kemper aren't just sidemen, they're cohorts.</TE>
<TE>   Dylan will always be known primarily as a man of words, but he put
such passion and joy into the playing that the show took on an added,
cleansing edge.</TE>
<TE>   By the end, the audience's mood was jubilant -- not just in awe of
an artist's legacy, but of his ability on this night to touch us so
gloriously anew.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Dylan plays tonight at 7:30 at the Wiltern Theatre, 3790
Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles. Sold out. (213) 380-5005.</TE>

<HD>A magical telling of Bard's 'Dream'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In honor of the Los Angeles visit of Dagmar Havlova, first lady of
the Czech Republic, the UCLA Film and Television Archive is
presenting tonight a rare screening of Czech animation genius Jiri
Trnka's exquisite 1959 magic puppet film of Shakespeare's "A
Midsummer Night's Dream." Playwright Howard Sackler's 1961
English-language version is narrated by Richard Burton and voiced by
renowned British actors.</LD>
<LD>   Trnka's original version had no dialogue -- but then, his film
could be described as a fantasy ballet. Trnka's fanciful world
envisions an Athens with a baroque touch and an enchanted forest as a
gossamer paradise.</LD>
<LD>   Shakespeare's convoluted plot involves four conflicted couples:
Theseus, the Duke of Athens, and Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons;
Oberon, King of the Fairies, and his queen, Titania; and young lovers
Hermia and Lysander, and Demetrius and Helena. But a night in the
woods, with a sprinkling of fairy dust that straightens everything
out.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps most breathtaking is the image of Trnka's voluptuous,
doe-eyed Titania, clad only in a garland of roses, and a train
composed of a zillion fairies, their wings beating like a multitude
of butterflies. Especially poignant is Bottom and his friends'
staging of the "Tragedy of Pyramus and Thisbe."</TE>
<TE>   Also screening tonight, at the Egyptian, is Allan Dwan's "Robin
Hood," starring Douglas Fairbanks, to mark the 80th birthday of
Hollywood Boulevard's first movie palace, which opened with this
film.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another offering tonight, at the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art, is "Mala Noche" (1985), which kicks off "The Essential Gus Van
Sant" retrospective. This is a film of rare tenderness and longing in
which a skid-row grocery clerk (Tim Streeter) falls hard for a macho
teenager, an illegal immigrant from Mexico. On Saturday and Sunday,
the UCLA archive presents as part of "Ida Lupino: Hard, Fast and
Beautiful" the Lupino-directed "Not Wanted" (1949) and "Never Fear"
(1950), tackling, respectively, unwanted pregnancy and polio. Also
screening is a great Warners double feature: Raoul Walsh's "They
Drive by Night" (1940) and Michael Curtiz's "The Sea Wolf" (1941),
which feature the feisty Lupino. The American Cinematheque presents a
seven-day run at the Egyptian beginning Monday of George Ratliff's
"Hell House," which documents how an Assembly of God church in Dallas
has turned Halloween into an opportunity to terrify teens onto the
path of righteousness. Its Grand Guignol tableaux, including the
effects of a botched abortion and death from AIDS, represent a deeply
disturbing conflation of primitive hellfire-and-damnation convictions
and technology.</TE>

<HD>More than skin deep</HD>
<DH>Rappers covet Mister Cartoon's tattoos</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Verini</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At almost 9 on a recent Saturday night, the normally placid face of
Mister Cartoon, tattoo artist, was showing signs of impatience. He'd
been waiting all evening in his studio, on the edge of this gritty
warehouse district behind Staples Center, for the arrival of a young
rapper named Fate-Al, who was stuck somewhere between Las Vegas and
downtown L.A.</LD>
<LD>   Mister Cartoon was eager to finish his latest masterpiece--a
bandoleer of rifle bullets that, when done, would stretch fully
around Fate-Al's chest and back. "Where is this dude?" Mister
Cartoon, nee Machado (he won't divulge his first name), said to no
particular member of his entourage. "Well, you know how these rappers
are."</LD>
<LD>   A friendly, pug-like 33-year-old from San Pedro, with a shaved
head and the quiet demeanor of a monk, Cartoon does indeed know how
these rappers are. He's been burning images into their arms, backs,
chests and necks for nearly a decade. But now the demand for his work
is such that it's usually he who makes people wait, no matter how
big-name the client. Cartoon's studio is unmarked and unlisted, and
he likes it that way. He tattoos only three days a week and prefers
to have a relationship with his clients before taking them on.
Fate-Al, as yet an unknown, was lucky to get an appointment.</LD>
<TE>   Cartoon is the tattoo artist to the hip-hop elite, ink-slinger to
the stars. "He's the best," says Fate-Al's manager. "Everybody wants
a tat from 'Toon."</TE>
<TE>   And it's not just rappers anymore. Justin Timberlake recently
dropped in and got a flying cherub, with his mother's initials and
the word "Savior," put on his back. The night before -- Cartoon
rarely does tattoos during the day -- Blink 182 drummer Travis Barker
had "Lover" tattooed on his stomach.</TE>
<TE>   But it's Cartoon's work on rappers for which he's best known.
Eminem's latest, a portrait of his daughter with the words "Bonnie
and Clyde" on his right shoulder, was done here, as was Eminem's
first, a hallucinatory scene, on his left.</TE>
<TE>   Method Man is a frequent client. Other clients include Outkast,
Xzibit, Fat Joe and Beyonce Knowles from Destiny's Child.</TE>
<TE>   "He speaks his mind -- he'll tell you if he doesn't like your
idea," says B Real of the rap group Cypress Hill. "But if he does
like it, he'll take it to another level. He can visualize what you
say to him."</TE>
<TE>   "Beyonce may have been the hardest," Cartoon says, "because she's
not only a woman but a diva, and not only a diva but 20 years old.
And this was her first tattoo." Knowles came into Cartoon's studio
with no idea what she wanted. After a long discussion, they decided
on a small angel in prayer. Where is it? "Let's put it this way,"
says Cartoon, who describes himself as a recovering but spiritual
Catholic. "Only the blessed will ever know."</TE>
<TE>   His favorite? "Probably the praying hands on the side of Travis'
nugget," he says, referring to Barker's head. "It just looks great
when he's driving that S500 Benz." Because of clients like Barker, he
says, "tattoos no longer mean that you're a scumbag dope-fiend
convict. You're an entrepreneur, a designer rock star."</TE>
<TE>   Mister Cartoon grew up drawing. He found his first paying job at
12, illustrating menus for local restaurants. For his 16th birthday,
he received an airbrush and took it to the Gardena swap meet, where
he set up a T-shirt-painting booth. From there it was on to detailing
jobs in the Southwest's low-rider car circuit. He also grew up
listening to hip-hop, but it wasn't until he met NWA founder Eazy-E
at a car show, and Eazy hired him to design album covers, that
Cartoon realized his art could straddle both worlds.</TE>
<TE>   Around the same time, he began hanging around in Hollywood tattoo
parlors, outlining designs for the artists in exchange for tattoos.
His first, a small scene on his left arm, depicts a clown with an
AK-47 machine gun slung over his shoulder. Clowns abound in his work.</TE>
<TE>   "The clown represents good times and bad times, and how you need
one for the other," he says. Cartoon's first big clients were members
of the rap group Cypress Hill, with whom he is still close. "They
went on tour in Lollapalooza, around the world, bragging on me," he
said. "You can't buy that kind of publicity."</TE>
<TE>   But it isn't publicity alone that has garnered Cartoon his
following. Not just dizzyingly ornate, his work is artistically
rigorous, exploiting perspective and multiple planes and light and
shadow to unique effect. His line -- he works only with black and
gray ink, a discipline known as fine-line -- has the precision of a
printer's, which stands to reason: His father, who taught him to
draw, is a retired printer. He is also known as a patient guide. "I'm
there to translate their ideas or their desires into an image," he
said. "I want to know what you like and then make it happen. I ask,
'What about you will never change?' "</TE>
<TE>   Cartoon's work runs anywhere from a few thousand dollars to
$20,000 for a full back piece. But it mystifies him when people try
to haggle. "You'll spend $50,000 on your car, but you're trying to
bargain with me on a tattoo? How do you put a price on emotion?"</TE>
<TE>   That said, Cartoon is not averse to pushing his product. His Joker
Brand clothing line brought in $2 million last year, and he has lines
of temporary tattoos and custom jewelry.</TE>
<TE>   "People think if you're a bald-headed Mexican driving an Escalade
that you're a drug dealer -- they can't conceive that I'm a committed
entrepreneur." And his commitment to the name? "Even my old ladies
call me Cartoon. But to tell you the truth, there's a Cartoon in
every neighborhood in L.A. I'm just the one with the credit card."</TE>

<LD>Call it Peanuts U.K.?</LD>
<LD>   It was a match made in ... the offices of Tsunami Entertainment?
Yes, that's how soft-pop guru Linus of Hollywood ended up working
with Charlatans U.K. vocalist Tim Burgess on material for a Burgess
solo album. "Our managers hooked us up," says Linus, who has been
holed up in his bedroom studio in Hollywood with a musician he'd
barely heard of one month ago. Burgess, who's lived in L.A. for four
years, fronted the Charlatans for eight albums since 1990. Burgess
isn't sure how different his solo material will be from the
Charlatans' dancy, organ-driven psychedelia, but he isn't at all
nonplused by his co-writer's Bachrachian leanings. "I brought in the
ideas," Burgess says, "and Linus has helped me see them fully
realized." In only three weeks, the collaboration has yielded six or
seven songs, which, judging from rough mixes, possess a
Coldplay/Travis kind of tunefulness and the duo aims to add
orchestration. Oh, and Linus' next solo gig is Dec. 3 at the Derby.</LD>
<LD>   He's simply reloading</LD>
<TE>   Looks like former Buckcherry lead singer Josh Todd is back on
stage. The wiry tattooed crooner will showcase his new combo Shots
Fired at the Whisky on Tuesday. Todd, who left the bluesy glam-rock
group in July, has been keeping busy with acting jobs (he had a bit
part in the Val Kilmer vehicle "The Salton Sea") and guest spots
(he'll appear on the upcoming release of Cypress Hill's DJ Muggs) but
proved he hasn't abandoned rock when he made a surprise appearance at
the Cat Club's popular Sunday-night jam last month.</TE>
<TE>   Who needs a U.S. tour?</TE>
<TE>   At 19, L.A.'s Jessica Riddle (now Jessica Jacobs, her married
name) was signed to Hollywood Records, and toured the country with
Savage Garden and BBMak. But despite her well-known touring partners
and photogenic appearance, Riddle focused more on music than fame. As
a result, her new songs are available on www.mp3.com for free, and
instead of touring nationally, she is back on the L.A. club circuit
-- including a date Tuesday at Genghis Cohen in Hollywood. Worth
hearing: the lovely, piano-based "Deserve Me."</TE>
<TE>   Quickly</TE>
<TE>   Angeleno (via Boston) singer-songwriter Jude Christodal, a KCRW
staple and former Maverick artist, returns to Largo on Tuesday for
another evening of smart pop gems, which may include his cover of
Bread's "Everything I Own." ... Members of Reel Big Fish, touring in
support of their recently released "Cheer Up," narrowly escaped
injury when their tour bus caught fire at a truck stop in
mid-Missouri last weekend. ... With major labels browsing but not
buying, former DreamWorks chanteuse Kim Fox (who performs tonight at
the monthly Third Thursday showcase at Highland Grounds) plans to
release her new album, "Return to Planet Earth," on Franklin Castle
Recordings. Jon Brion and Roger Manning are among the guests. ... Has
it been 12 years since the Ziggens co-founded Skunk Records with
Sublime? Time flies. The Ziggens celebrate this week's release of
their fifth album, a self-titled affair, with a show Nov. 7 at the
House of Blues Anaheim.</TE>

<LD>Rambles from</LD>
<LD>   a rambler</LD>
<LD>   With his chiseled jaw, bulky physique and daring exploits --
dropping into war zones to interview warlords, hanging with
firefighters -- Sebastian Junger can seem at a distance like a slim,
literary Schwarzenegger. But at a reading and signing at the Central
Library last Thursday night, the "Perfect Storm" author seemed
somewhere between a big, innocent kid and what one observer called "a
really smart bartender" with a knack for war stories.</LD>
<TE>   With occasional ramblings -- he apologized for "a huge tangent"
about the time he almost sliced his Achilles tendon -- Junger spoke
about his itinerant 20s, time spent "fishing around for a career" and
the pieces that make up "Fire" (paperback, Harper Collins; hardback,
W.W. Norton &amp; Co.), a collection of Hemingwayesque articles from
dangerous places. The book, which includes sections on the Taliban
and the Northern Alliance, has taken on new urgency with the war in
Afghanistan. Many of the questions that followed a brief reading came
back to the war on terror and the possibility of a U.S. attack on
Iraq. Junger traveled to Sarajevo "after spending my 20s doing things
that felt irrelevant." He intended to profile peril-seeking war
correspondents. "I just fell completely in love with war reporting."
While he was there, a publisher bought the idea that became "The
Perfect Storm," and he returned to his home on the New England coast
to write it. But immediately after turning in the manuscript, danger
called again: Afghanistan just seemed like too wild a place not to
see, with pickup trucks full of guys with machine guns and a warlord
living in a mud palace</TE>
<TE>   Junger ended up writing two pieces on guerrilla leader Ahmad Shah
Massoud, who beat the Soviets back 10 times during the 1980s -- even
shooting down a Soviet helicopter and converting it to a tour bus --
and later led the Northern Alliance against the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   The author talked about riding in rickety aircraft, bombs so
powerful you could feel their impact 20 miles away, the Afghan
invasion and the need for more U.S. aid to keep terrorists from
retaking the war-torn country. "I think it's really dangerous and
outrageous that we're dropping that country, like we did in the early
'90s," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's crowd ranged widely in age and style, including some
attractive young women who may be Junger groupies. One evoked from
him the admission that all the trips to war zones made it hard to
keep a girlfriend. As the crowd moved to the lobby to get books
signed, somebody said you can ask him about his relationships there
too.</TE>

<HD>Soulful pathos fills Poe's life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Philip Brandes</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What better way to gear up for Halloween than spending a couple of
hours in the company of that morbid literary genius Edgar Allan Poe?
That Poe died more than 150 years ago seems little more than a
technicality, thanks to John Astin's thoroughly convincing
performance in "Edgar Allan Poe, Once Upon a Midnight" at the Hermosa
Beach Playhouse.</LD>
<LD>   Astin slides into the role as if it were a well-worn cloak. His
sad-eyed, soulful first-person address brings pathos to this
well-researched tale of Poe's tragic life, co-written by Paul Day
Clemens and Ron Magid.</LD>
<LD>   Rescuing Poe's reputation as a dissolute drunkard, Astin reveals a
deeply passionate artist and luminous intellect undone by his
inability to master the mundane logistics of survival.</LD>
<TE>   Of the maniacal nonchalance Astin perfected as the definitive
Gomez on TV's "The Addams Family," only a few echoes appear, always
at appropriate moments, as when Poe gleefully recounts some of his
outrageous journalistic hoaxes and merciless critiques of peers.</TE>
<TE>   Astin's generally breezy, unsentimental narrating style is
punctured by devastating eruptions of feeling -- over the death of
the stepfather whose love he was never able to earn, or his
realization that the ravaging consumption that had claimed his mother
and stepmother had now laid its grip on his beloved wife.</TE>
<TE>   The latter sequence is enhanced by one the few visual flourishes
in Alan Bergmann's minimal staging: the image of a white dress
suddenly bathed in crimson light, signaling a transition to a
chilling passage from "The Mask of the Red Death."</TE>
<TE>   Overcoming the challenges in integrating excerpts from Poe's
writing is one of the production's most striking achievements.</TE>
<TE>   Reciting "The Raven" in its entirety, Astin cannot afford to milk
each line for atmosphere a la Vincent Price; it would take him most
of the second act.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he races through the poem as an author would in recalling
his own familiar words, gradually getting caught up in their power
and finishing on a dramatic crescendo.</TE>
<TE>   Another masterstroke is when Poe's ruminations during dinner with
his abusive stepfather become the murderer's loathing description of
his victim in "The Tell-Tale Heart." The narration's skillful
emulation of Poe's writing style smoothes over such transitions.</TE>
<TE>   In illuminating the connection between Poe's personal tragedies
and his macabre aesthetic, Astin's performance is flawless.</TE>
<TE>   "Edgar Allan Poe, Once Upon a Midnight," Hermosa Beach Playhouse,
710 Pier Ave., Hermosa Beach. Tonight-Saturday, 8 p.m.; Sunday, 2 and
7 p.m. Ends Sunday. $40-$45. (310) 372-4477. Running time: 2 hours,
10 minutes.</TE>

<LD>Without Cherry, it's the pits</LD>
<LD>   For eight years, the cross-dressing, gender-bending, trend-setting
dance club Cherry was the icing on Clubland's cheesecake. The popular
weekly club ushered in L.A.'s '90s glam-rock revival, and caused New
York rockers and queens to move to the Left Coast in droves. Like all
good things, it came to a quiet end last week, finishing out its run
at the Key Club in WeHo. Its promoter, Bryan Rabin, one of
Hollywood's hot party planners who's thrown red-hot galas for
Madonna, Christina Aguilera and Debbie Harry, is focusing his energy
on his blowin'-up events' company, Rabin-Rodgers. Cherry may be gone,
but it will never be forgotten.... One of Cherry's main scenesters,
Casper from the band the Pleasure Seekers, is launching a new
Wednesday night slice of rock 'n' roll mayhem at Goldfingers....
Popped into Immortal Ent.'s new Santa Monica digs and ran smack into
Tommy Lee. How fortuitous! ...</LD>
<LD>   Madcap scenes</LD>
<TE>   Madcap, a hot young punk band on the SideOneDummy label, tore up
the House of Blues in Anaheim and L.A. last week. We also hear Madcap
managed to smuggle Kelly Osbourne and her beau Bert McCracken of the
Used backstage at the Anaheim show. Wacky.... Rapper WC just got back
from New York, where he laid down some licks for Mariah Carey's
upcoming album. Girl's got taste.... Our favorite DJ-shopkeep, Nice
Fred, who owns the electronic record store This Is Music on Melrose
Avenue, is opening for Hacker &amp; Kiko on Oct. 30 at Club
Sixteen-Fifty. He really is nice.... The hardest-working queen in
show biz, Jackie Beat, is DJing at Fubar in WeHo every Thursday and
gets gussied up for That Time of the Month, his/her monthly drag gala
at the Sixty-Six club in Hollywood, which takes place the first
Sunday of each month.... The skate-punk band Western Waste trashed
the Key Club on Friday. Ran into the Vandals and Pennywise singer Jim
Lindberg at the gig. Jim says the mighty South Bay band is busy
writing a new record.</TE>

<HD>An Ozzy spinoff? Bite your tongue</HD>
<DH>DJ Louis Osbourne shrugs off mentions of his famous father.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maria Elena Fernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A stretch limousine stops to pick up DJ Louis Osbourne to take him to
the dance hall where he is spinning his deep house and techno beats
for New York's wild East Village crowd. As Osbourne steps into the
limo, the driver asks, "So this is the son of Lennon?"</LD>
<LD>   The son of Lennon? Osbourne's pretty girlfriend, Louise Lennon,
who is no relation to John Lennon, bursts out laughing. "Not the son
of Lennon! The son of Osbourne ... Ozzy Osbourne!"</LD>
<LD>   Osbourne's smooth demeanor is unfazed. "I thought it was pretty
funny, but I felt bad for him because I think he was disappointed,"
says Osbourne, 27. "At least the Beatles are my father's favorite
band."</LD>
<TE>   A product of rock star Ozzy Osbourne's first marriage, Louis
Osbourne shares his father's quick wit, love of music and
outrageously filthy language. Seconds into a conversation, the
younger Osbourne cuts to the chase: He knows his famously outrageous
father and MTV sitcom family are a pop-culture curiosity, and he
doesn't mind talking about them. But when it comes to his own career,
Louis Osbourne demands to stand alone. His contract stipulates that
there be no references to "The Osbournes," MTV or Ozzy Osbourne on
any billing.</TE>
<TE>   An up-and-coming DJ who hails from Birmingham, England, and spins
electronic dance music around the world, Osbourne has held
residencies in the rave party capital of Ibiza, Spain, and London's
Ministry of Sound. Last year, he played clubs in Europe, Japan,
Australia and 24 U.S. cities. And he's just getting started. He
recently signed an album deal with Strictly Rhythm Records in which
he will remix tracks with his own flavor and style.</TE>
<TE>   In the wee hours Tuesday morning, Osbourne appeared at Las Palmas
in Hollywood to spin. Shannon Sehwait, a professional modern dancer,
couldn't stop grooving.</TE>
<TE>   "There's something in his music that I can flow with," said
Sehwait, 23, of Los Angeles. "Other house DJs have harder rhythms. He
has different layers."</TE>
<TE>   "I want people to come see me for the DJ that I am," says
Osbourne, who is living temporarily in Los Angeles and may settle
here. " 'The Osbournes' have created some publicity for me, but it
hasn't affected my skills as a DJ one bit. I've been doing this
[bleep] for eight years."</TE>
<TE>   While his shock-rocker father has spent three decades wailing
heavy metal hits, the younger Osbourne prefers all-night raves with
loud thumping hypnotic house, tribal and techno music.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent hot afternoon, relaxing in his girlfriend's West L.A.
apartment, Osbourne wears a red T-shirt imprinted with a Latin
slogan: "When I turn, I see and learn." The CDs laying on a coffee
table come as a surprise: Coldplay, Snoop Dogg, "Duran Duran's
Greatest Hits," Marvin Gaye and the Beatles.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad doesn't really understand dance music," he says, still
trying to recover from his London flight. "He understands the
psychedelic experience of it all, the environment and the lights.</TE>
<TE>   "By the same token, when I see him on stage, I always think,
'Blimey, that's my old man.' "</TE>
<TE>   Osbourne says nothing illustrates the differences in their musical
tastes better than the time he was floating on his back in the pool
at his father's Beverly Hills mansion, blasting house mixes. His dad
ran outside yelling an obscenity-laced, unprintable and much longer
version of: Turn that crap off!</TE>
<TE>   "Essentially, what I do is still about entertaining people, and
that's something I do have in common with my dad," he says. "I put a
lot of energy into my performance, and I like to see the crowd
putting a lot of energy into it as well."</TE>
<TE>   Louis Osbourne's parents divorced when he was 6 and he spent most
of his childhood in boarding school. He won't discuss his older
sister and mother, who live in England.</TE>
<TE>   "On my mum's side, they are not involved in the entertainment
industry, and they have no voice in the media," he says. "So what is
the point if they have no voice? My dad? He's been making a career
out of his for 30-odd years. That's different."</TE>
<TE>   As a child, Osbourne enjoyed listening to Black Sabbath and his
father's voice, but the screeching of his father's guitar never moved
him to pick one up himself. Instead, he became curious about the
raves he begin reading about, and sneaked into his first party at 16.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're that age, you're trying to get into a rebellious,
youthful scene," he says. "You know, a [bleeping] underground
society. I went to that rave on my own and it just bit me."</TE>
<TE>   At 18, Osbourne dropped out of college, bought his first turntable
and started working for Hard to Find Records, a well-known music
store in Birmingham, England. "That's where I learned that I could
make a career out of it and give it my all," he says. "With the
technology out there, there's so much you can do. Whenever I come out
from the turntables, I'm usually drained. And quite drunk."</TE>
<TE>   Osbourne may have inherited his father's penchant for booze and
partying -- "I'm not an angel" -- but the son also credits his dad
for his work ethic. For three years, Louis Osbourne has been touring
the world, trying to distinguish himself from the hype of his last
name.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad's always drilled into me this notion that I need to do
things for myself, that I will appreciate what I have more later in
life if I work for it," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "He's always given me a lot of support and passion for life. And
he's always told me that in times of hardship, people always want to
eat and they want to be entertained."</TE>
<TE>   Although the electronic dance scene has peaked in his native
United Kingdom, the music Osbourne loves to play is slowly making its
way to the United States and Australia. His DJ influences include
producer-DJ Darren Emerson, Danny Tenaglia and Deep Dish.</TE>
<TE>   "What I do is about a moment," he says. "It's not about making a
lasting impression. But a friend of mine told me that if I'm making
people happy, I'm contributing something emotionally. It may not be a
beautiful painting or a gorgeous building to walk through, but it's
something."</TE>
<TE>   But these days, the DJ booth has competition in Lennon, an Irish
actress who Osbourne met in a Hollywood bar six months ago. She is
his first serious girlfriend in eight years. Osbourne is
head-over-heels in love and is thinking of settling down.</TE>
<TE>   "I come from a sitcom home now," says Osbourne, who has appeared
in several episodes of "The Osbournes." "So, of course, I'm the
marrying kind."</TE>

<HD>City souls, country hearts</HD>
<DH>Rootsy-sounding L.A. bands are picking up where Gram
Parsons left off 30 years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Hundley</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Noah Lambeth of the country band Hank Floyd leans into the song,
giving the lines -- "Gonna pick up today and leave tomorrow behind
me" -- all the wounded, beer-soaked ache of an Ole Opry vet. A few
women in wide Stetsons and tight jeans sway by the stage -- and
others who've come to the bar on this night respond to the lonesome
vibe. As the band comes sliding in on the plaintive wail of pedal
steel, a couple of wide-shouldered men cling to the bar and stare
down into the empty eye of a whiskey glass.</LD>
<LD>   It's a scene that could be playing out almost anywhere in America,
with a dirt parking lot outside blown over with tumbleweeds or
buzzing with cicadas. But Hank Floyd is an L.A. group, and outside
the traffic on busy Fairfax Avenue runs past this pub -- Molly
Malone's -- and its monthly Sweetheart of the Rodeo country music
night.</LD>
<LD>   Hank Floyd is playing its heart out, and Hank Floyd is not alone.
More bands are tapping into a tradition here that has endured since
the '60s.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think the scene has ever totally gone away," says Shilah
Morrow, host of Molly Malone's Sweethearts night with friend Lisa
Jenkins, "but I do think we're lucky in that there have been certain
bands lately -- like Ryan Adams and Wilco -- that have received a
certain degree of commercial success, that have allowed people to be
more open to this type of music than they might have been before."</TE>
<TE>   Country music may still a bit of a hard sell in L.A., but there
are signs of new energy everywhere. Partly as a reaction to the
recent influx of European electronica and DJ culture and partly as an
outgrowth of '80s-'90s indie rock, many American bands have been
embracing a more organic approach, drawing on a rich vein of
home-grown music from country and western to folk and blues. The
result has been a steady reemergence of roots-based rock and folkie
acoustic melodies.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, many of the city's younger musicians are tearing
up their rock 'n' roll roots, looking into the past and picking up
where icons like country rocker Gram Parsons and his predecessors
left off in the early '70s. In addition to Beachwood Sparks, such
local acts as the Idaho Falls, CB Brand, Hank Floyd, Jonny Kaplan and
Austin Hanks have chosen to abandon standard guitar swagger and giddy
pop fluff in favor of some down-home country sincerity. They play
where they can, when they can, from Silver Lake's Spaceland to the
Westside's the Joint.</TE>
<TE>   For young urban music fans today, the word "country" is most
likely to elicit a dismissive laugh or a smirk of distaste. But the
alternative country played by Wilco, Ryan Adams and the L.A. posse is
a far cry from the country heard on the airwaves. Only the most
successful (read: most accessible) of Nashville's newest generation
of fresh-scrubbed and white-toothed "hat acts" actually make it to
radio, leaving little room for the kind of genre-blending grit that
marks the new sound.</TE>
<TE>   Something special is beginning to coalesce live on small stages
around the city -- a wild and woolly reinterpretation of what is best
in L.A.'s long and varied country music history. Emerging from a wide
variety of backgrounds and influences, these up-and-coming bands are
revisiting the California sound in new ways, adding their voices to a
rich tradition of musical expression.</TE>
<TE>   The first Wednesday of every month, L.A.'s scattered country fans
gather at Molly Malone's for Sweethearts, a country music
free-for-all inspired by Parsons' music and named for the 1968 album
Parsons recorded while a member of the Byrds.</TE>
<TE>   With the Byrds (and later with the Flying Burrito Brothers and
collaborating with a young Emmylou Harris), Parsons became one of the
pivotal figures of L.A.'s late-'60s scene, an artist responsible for
a California country music renaissance (a style he coined "cosmic
American music").</TE>
<TE>   Parsons brought a more old-time Hank Williams or Jimmy Reed touch
to the Dylan-inspired folk-rock Laurel Canyon scene that had come
before him, with such figures as Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Buffalo
Springfield and Jackson Browne. He also wrote with the Rolling Stones
and inspired the country twang of "Exile on Main Street," now a
touchstone for the modern scene. The reverberations of this rich L.A.
tradition can still be felt. Parsons, however, wasn't the first to
bring true country to Los Angeles. There were the singing cowboys of
early Hollywood, Bakersfield giants like Buck Owens and Merle
Haggard, and the Palomino club in the Valley, which was host to
scores of country greats before shutting its doors in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, over the last few years, nights like Sweethearts, Ronnie
Mack's Barn Dance at Crazy Jack's and the Rural Revival at Genghis
Cohen have managed to keep the city's country heart beating.</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing is, not only does that tradition need to be
kept alive, but it also needs to keep evolving," says the Beachwood
Sparks' Dave Scher. The band's newest album, "Make the Cowboy Robots
Cry," on Seattle's Subpop label, is a dreamy space-age experiment
with only a hint of country roots. "Everyone doing this kind of music
starts at the same spot but ends up interpreting it in their own
way."</TE>
<TE>   Those ways are beautifully varied. The players in L.A.'s new
"Cali-country" scene are similar in that they are all young (20 to
35), fond of cowboy hats and vintage western wear and in love with
the music they're playing. But that's where the similarities end.</TE>
<TE>   Beachwood Sparks, a group of shaggy-haired Silver Lakers in their
late 20s, play an atmospheric mix of country kick and late-'60s
psychedelia.</TE>
<TE>   Idaho Falls, led by Idaho native Raymond Richards and L.A. local
Heather Goldberg, make sweeping, traditional country pop, with
sweetly harmonizing male and female vocals and gorgeous pedal steel
sway. Jonny Kaplan is an East Coaster with a West Coast heart who
plays dirty, bluesy, desert-dust country touched with the grind of
classic 1970s rock 'n' roll.</TE>
<TE>   CB Brand is led by 27-year-old Chad Brown, who hails from rural
Pennsylvania (by way of Arizona and Utah) and is influenced by
everyone from Willie Nelson to Merle Haggard to Waylon Jennings. CB
Brand makes a kind of music that its guitarist Daniel Papkin (a.k.a.
"Smoky Mountains") describes as "outlaw country soul."</TE>
<TE>   Hank Floyd's Noah Lambeth grew up among the rural orange groves
just outside of Riverside, and the band still practices there,
playing its blend of Hank Williams twang and old-school roots rock in
a ramshackle farmhouse known as "the Grove." Austin Hanks is an
Alabama transplant with a wide, white smile and a Southern-boy charm
who calls his gritty smoke-and-whiskey sound "three chords and a
cloud of dust."</TE>
<TE>   The adage rings true today: The only rule for the new Cali-country
is that there are no rules. Just take Parsons' lesson about the
beauty of the blend (rock, country, blues -- as long as it's got
soul, throw it on in) and run with it.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the main reasons I love playing this kind of music is
because I'm allowed to bring in all kinds of different influences,"
says Auresha Smolarski, who plays country fiddle for CB Brand and the
folk-influenced act the Mercy Sweet. "Whatever the song makes you
feel, you take it from there and add to it, which is really what
country music is about: people getting together and having a good
time and making good music."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tradition of storytelling," says CB Brand's Brown. "And
it's our story now. Our suitcase has stickers from ports of call
Willie and Waylon never sang about."</TE>
<TE>   Brown is right. These new bands are hailing from not only a
different time but also a very different place. Many of L.A.'s
country acts were weaned in city and suburb on a mix of punk, new
wave, 1980s hair metal and melodic, melancholy Brit pop. But in the
end, this doesn't seem to matter much, because roots are about how
you feel, not where you're from.</TE>
<TE>   "When I finally found country music, a whole new avenue opened up
to me," Hank Floyd's Lambeth remembers. "I was playing Brit pop stuff
at the time. What first attracted me to country was that I could
write exactly what I was feeling. I could put it so plain in just
three chords, and it was honest and it was real."</TE>
<TE>   Lambeth's sentiment is echoed by the other artists, many of whom
spent time in rock bands and found that the genre left something to
be desired in terms of lyrical narrative and raw sincerity. For the
country players here, this particular brand of music allows them to
convey an emotional vulnerability they were unable to express with
rock 'n' roll.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg of the Idaho Falls was exposed to country from an early
age, but it wasn't until recently that she began to dedicate herself
to the genre. "I was playing in a rock band for a long time," she
recalls, "but when I started playing pedal steel, I started listening
to this music all the time. There is just something so heartfelt and
so touching about this music."</TE>
<TE>   Brown agrees. "I'd always favored country sounds, beer-joint
music."</TE>
<TE>   He possesses a near-encyclopedic knowledge of country music
history (his manner of speech is more mid-1800s than early 21st
century) and was drawn here in large part by the city's vital country
music past. "It's the westward tendency. Go west! First Nashville,
then Austin, now California," he says. "But this place has always
been in the thick of it. This is where it all began, so it's fitting
that it all start here again."</TE>

<HD>Festival carries on Gram Parsons' dream</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Hundley</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gram Parsons was born in Winter Haven, Fla., and tried his hand at
Harvard, but it was not until he arrived in California that he truly
found his voice, and it is California that bears the indelible
imprint of his musical legacy.</LD>
<LD>   Parsons' is the sound of early 1970s Los Angeles, of desert heat
and sweet Topanga nights, of jasmine and dry scrub and lonesome city
streets. California is where Parsons found life and lost it, and for
those who love his music, it is the place that clings most tightly to
his ghost.</LD>
<LD>   For the last six years, fans have been gathering each fall in the
barrooms of Joshua Tree to celebrate the country rock legend,
probably best known for "Sin City" and "Hickery Wind." The annual
Gram Fest is a loosely organized tribute that occurs close to the
anniversary of his drug overdose death near there on Sept. 19, 1973.</LD>
<TE>   "I started this festival because I wanted to make people more
aware of Parsons' music," founder Jon McKinney says. "It's not about
death. It's about a positive artistic legacy. What I found was that
there were more people loving Gram than I could have imagined."</TE>
<TE>   This year's Gram Fest will be held on Saturday, with a long roster
of bands doing their best to keep Parsons' "Cosmic American" dream
alive. McKinney is hoping to continue in the tradition of musical
variation by providing a wide selection of acts, most of them with
little in common aside from their love of Parsons' rootsy
Cali-country sound.</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing about Parsons was that he wasn't afraid of
cross-pollination," McKinney explains. "He knew that there was value
in all kinds of different music. I tell the people involved to play
whatever they want. Folk, rock, whatever. The point is to break down
the cliques and to encourage camaraderie. That's what Gram would have
wanted. It's interesting because I think that is happening in music
now more than ever."</TE>
<TE>   Polly Parsons, Parson's daughter and a yearly festival attendee,
agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's strange, because I feel my father everywhere now, " she
says, "in the way people dress, in the way they think, in the sort of
music that's being made. It's an amazing feeling. Everything he ever
wanted is finally happening."</TE>

<LD>Ruth's Chris Steak House, the New Orleans-based chain, has just
opened a location in Woodland Hills -- with decor said to be inspired
by the 19th century designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Best known
for his Glasgow tearooms, Mackintosh might be surprised to find
himself posthumously collaborating on a shopping mall steakhouse.</LD>
<LD>   On a Friday night, I can't get a table. Not on Saturday either,
until I practically beg to come after 9:30. Steak fanciers must be
legion here, because the place seats 289. But I persist. I'm curious
to see what it looks like.</LD>
<LD>   It looks like this: Above the bar, a wood panel punctuated with
square cutouts is reminiscent of Mackintosh's furniture designs. The
cavernous dining room features a gently curved wood wall. That's it?
Except for the somber Mackintosh-esque palette, I guess.</LD>
<TE>   The place is not somber at all. Waiters with name tags rush about
the room in a blizzard of service. Order a cocktail; it arrives with
its shaker and is poured at the table. One person brings the wine;
another decants it. Whether the wine needs it, it makes for a good
show.</TE>
<TE>   The Ruth's Chris in Beverly Hills is a successful chain
steakhouse. What's not to like about prime aged steaks, perfectly
cooked and sizzling in butter? The kitchen here has some catching up
to do. The steaks are swimming in butter, and two ordered medium rare
arrive overcooked. A marinated veal chop is the star of the evening.
Along with Maine lobster (pick out your guy from the tank up front),
the restaurant offers Portabello "T-Bones." This must be for
vegetarians, though I can't imagine any who would join a steak fest.</TE>

<HD>Tom Petty the heartbroken</HD>
<DH>The indignant pop veteran pines for -- and delivers --
deeply felt rock at the Grand Olympic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Cromelin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With their indictments of mediocrity in general and the music biz in
particular, the most in-your-face songs on Tom Petty's new album have
suddenly turned the veteran rock musician into a sort of pop-culture
vigilante, a longhaired Dirty Harry just begging a trembling record
company weasel to make his day.</LD>
<LD>   During his concert at the Grand Olympic Auditorium on Tuesday,
Petty addressed this portrayal, which has been slapped on him since
the release last week of "The Last DJ."</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not only mad," Petty told the crowd in the auditorium, as
well as the audience on a simultaneous radio broadcast and theater
telecast. "There's a lot of hope left in this world, and this song is
supposed to symbolize that."</LD>
<TE>   That song, "Like a Diamond," blended star-point guitar notes with
the sweep of the 40-piece orchestra on hand for the occasion, but its
relative lack of eventfulness made a strong case that madder is
better.</TE>
<TE>   The album's title song and two of the three that follow it on the
record are more gripping because of the indignation that fuels them.
The other tune in that sequence, "Dreamville," is an affecting
companion, a heart-tugging reverie on a childhood in which love of
rock is woven with love of family and youthful wonder.</TE>
<TE>   For the concert-cum-telecast, Petty took the unusual course of
performing the entire new album in order. That opening segment set a
stirring tone, with a crowded cast of archetypes (rather than
characters) in the songs, including the title DJ (he talks too much
and won't play what the boys upstairs want him to), the rock star
whose music is drained of meaning by the business machinery, and the
crass, greedy record executive.</TE>
<TE>   Petty put on sunglasses to further caricature that evil
businessman, but that was the only time his crusade seemed
heavy-handed. The strokes may be broad, but Petty instills a real
sense of betrayal into his narratives, making palpable the sense that
something precious has indeed been lost.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of broadside is usually lobbed from the streets, not
from the belly of the beast, where Petty, an artist on the Warner
Bros. label, resides. It's too bad that he doesn't really address the
contradictions of dealing with this devil -- something that might add
a welcome layer of complexity to the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The album -- and therefore the show -- becomes less focused and
occasionally more generic as it proceeds, but Petty and his
Heartbreakers remain one of the class acts of the classic-rock
generation, and Tuesday they moved from swirling folk-rock to
arena-rock detonations with deceptive ease.</TE>
<TE>   This is the grand, heartfelt, gimmick-free rock whose demise Petty
mourns, so he had added incentive Tuesday to make it sound good, and
in that he never failed.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, with Jackson Browne, play Nov. 23
at the Forum, 3900 W. Manchester Blvd., Inglewood. Tickets on sale
Sunday. (310) 419-3100.</TE>

<HD>Security is a concern as networks gear up for war</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Jensen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- What a difference a mere decade makes, as the television
news business gears up to cover likely U.S. military action in Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The 1991 Persian Gulf War was a milestone for television news,
putting CNN on the map when the upstart cable network was able to get
a satellite phone into Baghdad, and its reporters hung a microphone
out their hotel window for a night of live reports as shelling of the
capital city started. With adequate notice that war was pending, CNN
and broadcast networks were ready for action when the bombs started
falling during the nightly news -- the first war to begin with live
televised accounts but without pictures.</LD>
<LD>   This time around, media outlets have similar signals that a
conflict is coming and it's time to prepare, if the expected
timetable of late December or early January holds. The technology is
even better, easier to transport and able to transmit pictures, not
just sound, by satellite phone.</LD>
<TE>   But the media landscape has radically changed. CNN is established
and no longer the most-watched U.S. cable news network, having ceded
that title to Fox News Channel. BBC Worldwide and Sky News compete on
the international 24-hour-news scene.</TE>
<TE>   Many more outlets have cameras trained on the region. CNN is
counting on an advantage from contacts it has established by
maintaining an extensive bureau in Baghdad since 1990, at
considerable expense. But it could end up upstaged by Arab networks
such as Qatar-based Al Jazeera. That network used its access to
provide the first pictures of last fall's bombing of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, however, the competitive aspects of the coverage
are less on the minds of executives than the basics, and many of
those remain the same. "We're picking locations, getting together a
list of equipment we need to bring, compiling lists of people willing
to go, just trying to marry everything together," said Marcy
McGinnis, senior vice president, news coverage for CBS News.</TE>
<TE>   Security is a paramount concern, with heightened worry over
biological and chemical attacks. CBS, like other networks, is sending
personnel to "hostile environment training." The network expects to
mobilize more than 100 employees in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike in Afghanistan, when reporters were able to rely partly on
Northern Alliance troops from that country for security when entering
war zones, reporters trying to get close to the action in Iraq will
largely be on their own, said Paul Slavin, executive producer of
ABC's "World News Tonight." Those in Baghdad could be targets, with
Western journalists required to work from Iraq's Ministry of
Information, which also houses government offices and the country's
TV operations, said Eason Jordan, CNN's president of news gathering.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the risks, volunteers appear to be plentiful. McGinnis has
had more people raise their hands "than I ever expected," including
many younger staffers, who have "seen the veterans cutting their
teeth on different kinds of wars. It's a rite of passage."</TE>
<TE>   With news-gathering budgets tight, particularly in the wake of the
past year's huge costs covering the war in Afghanistan, planning is
critical.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to go too early, because then you're waiting
around, spending money needlessly," McGinnis said. "On the other
hand, if you wait, you can be too late. It's similar to a hurricane.
If you send [anchor Dan Rather] tonight, it will be sunny tomorrow.
If you wait an extra day, you can't get there," because the weather
is too bad.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly we can't put all of our resources in for two months and
let them sit around, because we'd be broke," said Bill Wheatley, vice
president of news coverage for NBC News.</TE>
<TE>   He has just returned from Baghdad, where he was struck by the
contrast between a major newspaper's "plastic table" setup and NBC's
big office with extensive equipment for sending pictures. But echoing
other network executives, he said, "We believe we'll have the money
we need. It's a very important, major story."</TE>
<TE>   CNN has a $36-million contingency fund for coverage; other
networks declined to be specific. ABC and CBS expect to save some
money as they did during the Afghanistan war by sharing satellite
transmission facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who covered [the Gulf War] remember that there were many
difficulties in terms of getting timely information," Wheatley said.
Military pools of reporters who went in with U.S. troops to report
"weren't particularly successful in terms of getting material back."</TE>
<TE>   In all the planning, executives said, they are trying to remain
flexible; there could be a preemptive military strike tomorrow or no
military action in the end, said one. Executives focused on
stationing personnel in Baghdad could find that the country revokes
visas and kicks everyone out, leaving people to scramble for new
locales.</TE>
<TE>   Just as generals are cautioned against looking back and not to the
future, "Maybe the media generals shouldn't be fighting the last
war," Wheatley said. "We really don't know precisely how this war is
going to play out."</TE>

get home, I run some bathwater, I put that Vaseline Skin Therapy in
the water and take a good old bath -- let the jets hit me. Yeah. Then
I go get in the bed and take a nap.</LD>
<TE>   Later the boys in my crew will come by, we load up the bus and we
head for the club. I do a show. I drink my water -- no, I don't drink
alcohol or smoke. Now, I am working, but you know what? I am
entertaining and I'm being entertained. I love it.</TE>
<TE>   On the move</TE>
<TE>   Saturdays, if there's something that I want to see, I catch me a
matinee. I'll usually go to Universal CityWalk or to the Bridge in
Culver City. Universal is cool.... I like it when there isn't a gang
of people around. I've got a plan, though. When I go, one of my guys
will go up and grab the tickets, then I go in right before it starts.
Sometimes I've missed the show, signing autographs and posing with
people, taking pictures, but it's all right.</TE>
<TE>   Then next I'll have lunch. I stopped eating meat, so I grab a
salad anywhere. But I like to go to Joe's Universal over on La
Cienega. I have a salad and they have these steamed vegetables; it's
Caribbean food.</TE>
<TE>   How about that?</TE>
<TE>   I like boxing. I like to see it live -- those pro debuts -- when
they're young and hungry. I watch them boys beat the heck out of each
other. But I didn't watch the De La Hoya-Vargas fight, because
Fernando Vargas is a personal friend of mine. But normally, I'll
watch boxing on TV too.</TE>
<TE>   I watch MTV or MTV News or some job-related specials. But I'm more
a Discovery Channel, MSNBC kind of guy; I like documentaries. You
know, something that doesn't have an actor, a plot. Yeah, I like
documentaries -- and porn. (He's joking.)</TE>
<TE>   In my television room I've got my own nice big chair and an
ottoman. And nobody can sit in my chair. I don't care if I've got 15
people there and somebody's got to stand up against the wall. I don't
care if I'm in the shower; I tell them: "No you cannot sit in my
chair! "</TE>
<TE>   I have a complete Surround Sound system, 66-inch screen and I sit
right up on the screen -- in my chair.</TE>
<TE>   For exercise, well I think about hiking. No, I have a trainer, but
I don't see him everyday. I try. But not everyday.</TE>
<TE>   It's a family affair</TE>
<TE>   Sundays I like to hang with my family -- my brothers and sisters
and cousins, nephews -- listen to some music. We've got a big family
house in Culver City. I go to church with them sometimes. Being with
family keeps you grounded.</TE>
<TE>   My fantasy weekend would be if that Friday night, Saturday and
Sunday, I'd have no obligations. Three days without having to be
anywhere, eating the food that I can't have. But I can never get
those kind of days.</TE>
<TE>   On the road again</TE>
<TE>   My life is planes, trains and automobiles. Next week I'm going to
Japan. Power 106 is broadcast in Japan, so I'm doing a concert -- six
nights with Xzibit. But traveling is hard. When you get back, you've
got to play catch-up.... I love being busy. I'm always working. I'm
always doing something. But really, my whole life is a party.</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica Hundley</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gary BASEMAN is easy to spot in a crowd. Maybe it's the gleam in his
eye or the wide and slightly toothy grin, or maybe it's the spring in
his step as he walks, as if he's in the habit of heading somewhere
particularly exciting. Or maybe it's the fez.</LD>
<LD>   At his solo opening at La Luz de Jesus Gallery in Los Feliz
recently, the 42-year-old artist was moving through the room, proudly
sporting a red felt cap of the kind normally found on the heads of
Turkish diplomats and aging, parading Shriners. Yet somehow, the fez
looks right on Baseman. It provides the perfect fashion accent to his
visual aesthetic as well as a playful counterpoint to the highbrow
arts establishment.</LD>
<LD>   On Baseman, a fez simultaneously signifies both childlike
innocence and a streak of rebellious glee.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Los Angeles and educated at UCLA, Baseman has evolved over
the years from a skilled and insightful illustrator to a kind of
graphic arts jack-of-all-trades. His work has appeared on the pages
of the New Yorker, the New York Times, Rolling Stone and The Los
Angeles Times. The work also is featured on promotional accounts for
Nike, Kodak and the board game Cranium.</TE>
<TE>   Baseman blesses the marriage of art and commerce, his disregard
for art-world elitism recently culminating in the creation of his
Emmy Award-winning cartoon series (and soon to be feature film),
"Teacher's Pet."</TE>
<TE>   "I like to say that the line between genius and stupidity has been
smudged beyond recognition," Baseman says with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   For his show at La Luz, titled "I Am Your Pinata and Other
Paintings About Love and Sacrifice," Baseman has threaded his
brightly illuminated, slightly askew world of ducks and bunnies and
sad-eyed ice-cream cones with a brooding undercurrent of violence,
the kind of graphic imagery one might not expect from a man whose day
job is a network TV series.</TE>
<TE>   In choosing pieces for the exhibition, Baseman set his imagination
free, and the result is a giddy, candy-colored nightmare, a dream
world touched with goofy, "Itchy and Scratchy"-style masochism. In
most of the pieces, a pinata figures prominently, spilling pink guts
and slick intestines instead of the usual lollipops and party favors.</TE>
<TE>   "I liked the idea of the pinata," Baseman says. "I liked this idea
of it representing this celebration of human frailty and
vulnerability. What I'm saying is, 'Allow yourself to accept your own
faults.' I like the idea of having yourself in front of everybody and
allowing them to take a whack, of opening up yourself, of taking
chances and taking risks. And I wanted the images to be provocative."</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite the macabre pinatas, the dancing skeletons and the
severed heads that float like gruesome balloons, there is something
undeniably endearing about Baseman's work, something cheery and
good-natured, much like the man himself.There may be violence here
but it is depicted with a Looney Tunes sense of the surreal. In the
end Baseman's paintings deliver the bitter medicine of human frailty
with more than a few spoonfuls of sugar.</TE>
<TE>   "There is so much absurdity, the absurdity of little kids hitting
an animal with a stick to get candy, for instance," Baseman says.
"That's what I love, taking things from society that are a little
twisted and feeding them back with some humor and insight."</TE>
<TE>   At La Luz, the mood of opening night befits Baseman's philosophy.
Next to the cups of red wine and platter of cheese cubes sits an
enormous white-frosted coconut cake and a bag of complimentary
pinwheels. Outside, in a dark back alley, stylishly attired art
patrons are bashing away at a large and swaying Baseman pinata. It is
an 8-year-old's birthday party gone horribly, wonderfully awry.</TE>
<TE>   For the artist, smiling in the midst of the chaos, it feels
exactly right. "This is great isn't it?" he says contentedly, fez
bobbing, "I mean, this is really fun."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<TE>   Two of Baseman's favorites</TE>
<TE>   To eat: One of my favorite restaurants is Ciudad. I love the
Brazilian Moqueca. They never make a bad mojito. Kate Mantilini for
its ahi tuna medallion salad, Phillipe's French dip, Moishe's in the
Farmers Market for its mouhamara (walnut and pepper dip) and Canter's
for my mom.</TE>
<TE>   To find true inspiration: The flea market. The Rose Bowl and
Fairfax High are where I find my prizes/muses: old Halloween photos,
wood-jointed toys, kid's old sketchbooks, mannequin heads and hands,
Michelin men, old intriguing paintings.</TE>

<HD>They flip for gymnastics</HD>
<DH>Classes provide an outlet for kids with energy to burn,
though parents may find the cost daunting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brenda Rees</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LINDA Potash knew she had to do something creative when her daughter
Sarah, then 3, constantly used the bed as a trampoline and was
forever doing headstands against walls.</LD>
<LD>   "She would also line up toy trucks and cars, vault over them using
a chair and land on the couch," recalls the Los Angeles mom. "I
thought, 'There's got to be a safer way to do this.' "</LD>
<LD>   Kids who are bouncing off walls can find the perfect outlet for
their unchecked energy at one of the many local gymnastic programs
around the Southland. The same types of all-ages programs that L.A.
gymnast Cathy Rigby used as a springboard to the 1968 Olympics can
provide children with a safe, structured way to develop muscles,
coordination and determination.</LD>
<TE>   About 5 million kids nationally attend a weekly gymnastic program,
according to Indianapolis-based USA Gymnastics, the governing
organization of the sport. An average gym will see nearly 600
students weekly for classes, practice sessions and one-on-one
coaching. According to Potash--whose daughter is now 6 years old and
a regular at the Los Angeles School of Gymnastics in Culver City--the
sport has become an integral part of her life.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone knows her at [the gym], and she's happy to go there
every time," Potash says. And there are side benefits to the times
spent practicing. "She knows now that she has to work hard to achieve
things. That's a great lesson to learn."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, visit any young gymnastic class and observe kids
attempting a simple forward roll or a walk across a balance beam.
Eyes are squinted, jaws clenched. Slow and steady movements. And then
... success! Pure joy fills their faces.</TE>
<TE>   "I love her big smiles when [my daughter's] done something
difficult," says Juanita Mera as she watches 3-year-old Nenequi join
her classmates in a variety of relay races at Junior Gym in Van Nuys
one Saturday morning. "We got her involved here because we wanted to
improve her motor skills and get her physically stimulated," says
Mera of Nenequi, who is small for her age. "This gets her up and
going."</TE>
<TE>   Gyms have been offering "Mommy and Me"-type classes for infants
and toddlers as well as preschooler lessons for at least 40 years.
Children get a chance to hone their pre-gymnastic skills while
observing older kids and teenagers practice cartwheels on the floor,
flips on the bars and swings on rings. But traditional gym
environments that resemble spacious warehouses--with multiple classes
going on--may be overwhelming to some youngsters. Today, new gyms
specifically cater to the young set.</TE>
<TE>   Created in 1983, My Gym focuses on children 1 to 7 years old, with
100 gyms around the country. In addition to teaching the basics of
gymnastics, the classes involve puppet shows, songs and games. "Our
goal is to have kids exiting the program happy, fit and ready for any
other athletic program," says Cory Bertisch, My Gym president, adding
that "gyms can promote physical along with emotional and social
development for kids."</TE>
<TE>   While many older kids are happy to keep gymnastics as a
recreational sport, others choose to participate in competitive teams
that could possibly lead them to the Olympics one day. Their numbers
are small (only 2% of all gymnastic students), but for those who can
put in at least four practice sessions per week at three hours per
day, the rewards of being on a competitive team are great. "I like
the challenges, and the people I have met at competitions are fun. I
like to travel to the meets too," says 14-year-old Chelsea Higley of
Long Beach, who is on the Lakewood YMCA competitive team. "It's fun
to have the younger kids watch us. It's like we are little idols or
something."</TE>
<TE>   But plenty of kids enjoy gymnastics simply because it helps them
with other sports. "Lots of boys come to our programs because they
are in karate or martial arts," says Tanya Berenson of the Los
Angeles School of Gymnastics. "And we see other athletes like
cheerleaders, ice skaters and dancers taking gymnastics to help
them."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the cost of gymnastic classes can be daunting. On average,
parents can expect to pay $9 to $12 for a weekly group gymnastic
session. Private lessons range from $35 to $50 per hour on average,
with team fees costing $100 to $200 per month for nine to 20 hours a
week.</TE>
<TE>   Alternatives to traditional gyms can be found at many local park
and recreation boards, which often offer kids' gymnastic programs at
a low price, though usually with less sophisticated equipment. (Most
park programs also welcome students from all areas for a slightly
higher fee.) Burbank Parks and Recreation, for example, offers a
series of gymnastic classes for infants to youths that costs about
$30 to $40 for an eight-week session.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, whether the gym program is big or small, the parents'
biggest role is as cheerleader. "Kids love to explain to their
parents what they have learned and how they did it," says Loree
Galimore of USA Gymnastics. "When a parent says, 'I can't wait to see
your new move,' or 'Wow! Have you improved from last month!' kids are
glowing, and that's what you want."</TE>

<LD>Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the 20th Century -- This
fitfully transcendent production captures the splintered insights and
cut-and-paste aesthetic of Greil Marcus' cult-classic book about the
rise of Britain's Sex Pistols. The adaptation by the Rude Mechanicals
of Austin, Texas, stays aloft through its raw, unnerving energy,
restless idea-shuffling and brutally wistful poetry. The Sex Pistols
showed youth how to party on truth's wreckage. No matter if we were
really only dancing on culture's exquisite corpse.</LD>

<LD>Obviously I'm not going to change Robert Hilburn's mind about the
"American Idol" concert ("No Pedestals for 'Idol,' " Oct. 10), but
keep in mind that Kelly Clarkson won the competition, and her single
has gone to No. 1 faster than anyone else's in recent music history.</LD>
<LD>   There is a reason why Kelly won, and that is talent. Her talent
might be crude and unrefined, but it is talent nonetheless. I know
she will get better in time.</LD>

<TE>   How dare you diss the performances of these kids. At least they're
trying to bring back wholesome music for our young people. Why don't
you go to the "American Idol" message boards and look on Justin
Guarini's board? You'll find that he has a multitude of fans of all
races, ages and both genders who love him and think he's the
greatest. He will succeed in this thing called show biz because of
his tremendous talent and his fans supporting him.</TE>
<TE>   They also dissed Elvis when he first appeard on stage. Also the
Beatles. How about Madonna? Oprah thought so highly of Justin that
she had him on her show. "Saturday Night Live" did a parody on
Justin's hair, which is the ultimate compliment.</TE>

<HD>New Yorker fiction editor leaves post</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hilary MacGregor</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After eight years at the New Yorker, during which he published a
range of unknown, up-and-coming authors, Bill Buford will depart his
post as fiction and literary editor at the end of December to return
to writing.</LD>
<LD>   "I think Bill is one of the great fiction editors that the New
Yorker has ever had," said David Remnick, editor of the magazine. "It
is always wonderful to keep publishing your terrific mainstays, like
[John] Updike or [Alice] Munro, but everyone's challenge is to bring
new voices into the chorus. He was able to do that with real
intelligence and heart."</LD>
<LD>   Some of those writers were Zadie Smith, Dave Eggers (whose first
story published in the New Yorker was nonfiction) and Jhumpa Lahiri,
who went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.</LD>
<TE>   In January, Buford, 48, will return to writing full-time, starting
with three books for Knopf. "Heat" will be about Mario Batali, chef
of Babbo in New York, whom Buford profiled this past summer in the
New Yorker. A second book is a collection of short pieces for the BBC
about life in America. The third is a memoir about his father, a
nuclear physicist, and the aerospace industry in 1950s California.</TE>
<TE>   A year from now, Remnick said, Buford will join Jane Kramer as a
correspondent in Europe. The country has not yet been decided.</TE>
<TE>   Buford came to the New Yorker after editing Granta for 15 years.
While in England, the ex-pat is credited with turning the Cambridge
literary magazine around, and giving early exposure to authors such
as Salman Rushdie, Mario Vargas Llosa and Gabriel Garcia Marquez.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, he wrote "Among the Thugs," a nonfiction book about
crazed soccer fans.</TE>
<TE>   George Plimpton, editor in chief of the Paris Review, said that
the New Yorker remains the premier platform for American fiction.</TE>
<TE>   "In the old days it was Esquire," Plimpton said, noting that
Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald were published there. It
wasn't until the '40s, Plimpton said, that the New Yorker became a
literary showcase. "For any writer to have fiction in the New Yorker
is as high as you can go," Plimpton said.</TE>
<TE>   The New Yorker has not yet named Buford's successor.</TE>

<HD>Same guys, dumber stunts</HD>
<DH>The idiotic and perilous pranks hit new heights as MTV's
reality series 'Jackass' moves to the big screen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andre Chautard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TURNING the hit MTV series "Jackass" into a feature-length film sent
star Johnny Knoxville to the emergency room only three, maybe four
times; he can't really recall. One stunt gone awry left him in an
overturned vehicle with a bloody gash on his head, footage of which
is shown in the film with an off-screen voice yelling, "Don't move
him!"</LD>
<LD>   "It's healed, I think," Knoxville says over lunch at a West
Hollywood dive. "Not that many stitches. Seven or eight." With the
injury coming after a series of concussions he suffered on the TV
show, Knoxville began having bouts of vertigo. "Finally they gave me
some medicine that made it go away a little, but I still get it," he
says.</LD>
<LD>   "Jackass," which ended after three seasons as MTV's highest-rated
show at the time, was all about this kind of self-destruction.
Knoxville and his cohorts pioneered a new brand of squirm-inducing,
moronic-yet-riveting diversions, in segments such as "beard of
leeches," "human BBQ" and "slingshot skateboarding." It was a new low
for reality TV: idiotic pratfalls almost guaranteed to fail, executed
by gutsy young men who would apparently do anything.</LD>
<TE>   The 90-minute "Jackass, the Movie," which opens next Friday, takes
the crude pranks, breakneck stunts and nudity-filled shenanigans to
even greater extremes. It's simply a larger version of their lowbrow
indulgences. As Knoxville puts it, "Same crew, same cast, same level
of incompetence."</TE>
<TE>   "The guys really just let loose," says "Jackass" co-creator and
director Jeff Tremaine. "They were all pent up and ready to go. When
Paramount committed to an R-rated movie, everyone was just gung-ho."</TE>
<TE>   Some would say they're lucky to have a movie at all. After a rash
of backyard imitators, including a 13-year-old Connecticut boy who
suffered second- and third-degree burns while attempting a
"Jackass"-type stunt, there were threats of legal action and calls
for MTV to pull the show, most notably from Sen. Joseph Lieberman
(D-Conn.).</TE>
<TE>   "I do feel horrible that it happened to that kid," Knoxville says.
"But no, I don't feel responsible for that." He and Tremaine say the
show and the movie carry strict warnings against copying anything,
that any videotapes sent in by viewers are returned unopened and that
they tried to avoid easily imitable stunts in the film.</TE>
<TE>   Even Knoxville was initially cool to the idea of a film version,
though for a different reason. He believed that after 24 episodes,
the television series had gone as far as it could go. Four months
after the last show aired, however, Tremaine says, "I think everyone
missed the antics. The ideas were flying out of us." A movie looked
more and more like a possibility.</TE>
<TE>   Among the arsenal of props assembled for their big-screen
debauchery: alligators, firecrackers, mousetraps, wasabi, tightropes,
panda outfits, and -- as usual -- all manner of human excretion. With
an upgrade to a movie-sized $5-million budget, the "Jackass" troupe
was able to go international, wreaking havoc from Mexico to England
to Japan, where they did "things that would have got you beat down in
the United States," Knoxville says. "We almost got thrown out of our
hotel every night," Tremaine adds.</TE>
<TE>   The movie was shot in six months, with one to eight Digital Beta
cameras capturing the mayhem. Given that mayhem, the cast thought it
unlikely that the finished film would be approved by the MPAA ratings
board. "I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's one of the
naughtiest films ever to get an R rating," Knoxville says. "They
should have given us an R-plus."</TE>
<TE>   To the "Jackass" team's surprise, they didn't have to cut any of
the bits, only avoid "lingering," or spending too much time on
provocative images. "We constantly had to keep sending it back and
forth," Tremaine says. "But we ended up with the movie we wanted."
Tremaine adds that they wanted the film to be R-rated to keep young
kids out.</TE>
<TE>   Knoxville sees "Jackass, the Movie" as a coda to the series and is
unenthusiastic about the prospect of a sequel. "People become inured
to the type of comedy we do after a time," Knoxville says. "We all
want to quit before that happens."</TE>
<TE>   He does allow, however, that "we did have quite a few ideas that
we didn't get to." Fans can catch DVDs of the second and third
seasons of "Jackass" in December. (The rights to the first season
have not been cleared.) For now, Knoxville, who lives in L.A., will
focus on his fledgling movie career, which has included supporting
parts in this year's "Men in Black II," "Big Trouble" and "Deuces
Wild."</TE>
<TE>   Knoxville, Tremaine and director Spike Jonze are also working on a
pilot for Fox, and Knoxville still hopes to star in the comedy "The
Ringer," with the Farrelly brothers producing, and the action-comedy
"Big Ticket," both of which have been stuck in development.</TE>

<KH>A NIGHT AT</KH>
<HD>Luxe of the draw</HD>
<DH>Club offers a grab bag of DJ music, vaudeville and
performance art.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julia Gaynor</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These days, it's just not enough for a nightclub to hire a DJ, play a
few records and sell some drinks. Oh, no. That's far too
one-dimensional for the sophisticated sensibilities of L.A.'s
cutting-edge club-crawlers. Our attention spans demand more. We need
a hook, a draw. Enter Luxe, L.A.'s latest "hybrid nightclub."</LD>
<LD>   Just a few steps beyond the ubiquitous burlesque rage sweeping the
city, Luxe is a twisted love child of Studio 54 and cabaret, offering
three glorious hours of eclectic DJ sounds that culminate with a 1
a.m. cabaret show hosted by the club's creator, Andrew Ableson.</LD>
<LD>   Ableson emcees an old-school variety show of sorts that changes
weekly. Recent shows have included "Mr. Funnybones," a tuxedo-clad
gent tap-dancing to "Puttin' on the Ritz" with a pinata on his head,
and "The Mike Show," featuring a sexy, druggie-looking lounge singer
who belts out incongruous pop medleys. One of his most popular
creations is the "Madonna Summer," a medley of Madonna and Donna
Summer songs.</LD>
<TE>   Ableson is the son of Frankie Vaughn, Britain's answer to Tony
Bennett, and he pays tribute to his famous dad with a nightly
straight-to-the-heart croon at the beginning of each set -- without
irony. "Irony is the last refuge of the untalented," he says. "When
you can't do it, you make fun of it. I want what I do to be beautiful
and sincere."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the cabaret set is entirely without irony is in the eye of
the beholder, but all of the performers certainly take their
particular brand of showmanship to the hilt. Whether it's the
"Tapping Fossettes," a six-member team of tap-dancers who accompany
Abelson's rendition of "Wilkommen" from "Cabaret," or Jordan Moore,
who, looking the picture of Norma Desmond in a turban and muumuu,
gives the audience a video tour of Hollywood homes from the '20s and
'30s with a Rudy Vallee soundtrack behind her, this performance art
has its roots in the old fashioned variety show -- with some modern
twists. For instance, as it appears to be all the rage to take your
clothes off and set yourself on fire, Luxe will soon feature the
fire-eating burlesque dancer "Mistress Malicious."</TE>
<TE>   The vaudevillian lineup changes each week, as do the spinning
wheels of DJs Javier Natureboy, Bradley Tuck, Otter and DJ Oranj, who
play from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. Each DJ plays his own specialized type of
music, from tripped-out cocktail lounge to disco to punk.</TE>
<TE>   Here, the one thing you can count on is that nothing is ever the
same. The club's venue is the newly refurbished M-Bar, in what was
Filet Mignon, a Romanian steakhouse at 1253 Vine St. (at Fountain
Avenue). The intimate and louche-ly appointed space has retained most
of the original decor from its steakhouse days: red flock wallpaper,
red booths, red lacquer trim and ceiling and plenty of mirrors and
beveled glass chandeliers reminiscent of something from Russia circa
1979.</TE>
<TE>   And although it does feel cutting-edge cool and draws more than a
few beautiful people, the 2-month-old nightspot has no sense of
elitism and refuses to enforce an exclusionary door policy. Ableson
thinks velvet ropes aren't necessary: "People will weed themselves
out."</TE>

<HD>Determined departure</HD>
<DH>For its new work, dance-pop band Underworld tried to act
like it wasn't, well, Underworld.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dean Kuipers</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Underworld, says its singer Karl Hyde, is an anti-brand. He's not
interested in making sure anything sounds like Underworld. "Born
Slippy," its million-selling 1996 club anthem whose irrepressible
chug and droning "mega mega lager lager" mantra-like lyrics lent the
film "Trainspotting" its air of post-acid house debauch, happened
once, a non-album flash of genius. To work like a pop band and try to
bottle that sound, he says, is to become a cartoon.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Hyde and partner Rick Smith approached the making of
their new album, "specifically thinking about not being Underworld,"
Hyde says.</LD>
<LD>   With the departure of techno DJ Darren Emerson, who has returned
to live club DJing and making dance mix albums, most recently with
British DJ Tim Deluxe, the pair decided to cultivate new sounds.</LD>
<TE>   "Forget Underworld and see what happens," Hyde says. "What usually
happens is, naturally, we do some things that are familiar to
people."</TE>
<TE>   Not being Underworld has produced an album, "A Hundred Days Off"
(Junior Boy's Own/V2), that is not only the next step in the
evolution of dance music as pop, the logical one-up on the DJ
composition methods of Moby's "Play" or DJ Shadow's "Endtroducing ...
," but also reclaims club music as a vision as sophisticated as
Radiohead or Coldplay.</TE>
<TE>   It is also, despite Hyde's cant, pure Underworld. House music at
its root, the album is a masterwork of electronica, with tendrils
reaching into the atmospheric 1970s work of German synth band
Tangerine Dream or even the soft prog rock of Camel ("EssGee,"
"Leutin"), J.J. Cale-style back-porch blues ("Trim") and the best
Massive Attack cut never made, "SoloSistim."</TE>
<TE>   It also contains the next "Born Slippy": "Two Months Off," the
album's first single, was the dance manifesto of the summer, destined
for soundtrack or TV ad use, already hailed by DJs from the U.K.
superclubs to Paris to Ibiza as the track that has the crowds
peaking.</TE>
<TE>   Disguised as a generic techno thumper, the nine-minute album
version blossoms slowly into a soaring, melodic, bell-chiming anthem,
with Hyde's disembodied vocal repeating "You bring light in" over and
over until it sounds like the only thing worth saying.</TE>
<TE>   While pleased to be connecting on a mass level, Hyde says there's
no way this can be a goal he'd set for any of this music.</TE>
<TE>   "That only happens if we let it happen," he says. "We're not very
good at contriving it. My own and Rick's experience of the '80s, when
we tried to be a pop group, were so bad, we failed so miserably at
trying to be a group that had a sound, we knew that there was no
mileage in us trying to write hits."</TE>
<TE>   Hyde, an artist making gallery installations in the 1970s,
originally linked up with fellow artist Smith to form an '80s
new-wave band called Freur. They released albums "Doot-Doot," in 1983
and "Get Us Out of Here" in 1985 before imploding.</TE>
<TE>   Hyde worked on guitar sessions for Debbie Harry and Prince, then
reunited with Smith in 1988 to form an industrial band called
Underworld, when bands such as Ministry were the new cutting edge.</TE>
<TE>   A pair of forgettable albums for Sire, "Underneath the Radar" and
"Change the Weather," went nowhere, and Underworld version 1.0
disintegrated.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, Hyde and Smith co-founded Tomato, a groundbreaking
eight-man graphic design collective that quickly became the envy of
the Macintosh generation with superclients like Nike, Sony, Pepsi and
Adidas. It still designs Underworld album packages and videos.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to make their music part of Tomato, Hyde and Smith
recruited Darren Emerson, then a rising techno DJ, in 1991 and began
releasing dance singles as a new group, Lemon Interrupt. First
success came in 1993 when they returned to the name Underworld with
the singles "Rez" and "MMM ... Skyscraper I Love You." Sensing the
power in the British acid-house revolution, they went straight for
the techno jugular, releasing a pure dance album called
"Dubnobasswithmyheadman" later that year, which made the British pop
charts.</TE>
<TE>   Underworld's follow-up album, "Second Toughest in the Infants,"
hit the U.S. in 1996 with the banging single "Pearl's Girl," but had
more critical than commercial impact until the 1996 release of
"Trainspotting," which featured a new Underworld single, "Born
Slippy."</TE>
<TE>   The song meshed perfectly with the film's harrowing, almost
operatic drama about young Scottish heroin addicts. Hyde's cut-up
style captured the terrible beauty and hollow promise of club life,
from visions of coke-induced loveliness ("She said comeover
comeover") to "squatting pissed in a tube-hole at Tottenham Court
Road." This was "Quadrophenia" for a new doomed generation. Like
Prodigy and Orbital, Underworld became a dance band making smart new
pop music.</TE>
<TE>   Years of touring ensued in which Underworld, along with Orbital
and Prodigy, proved that dance bands can compete with rock acts for
pure live entertainment value.</TE>
<TE>   "The records can be quite cerebral spaces. We often see them as
films, or as journeys, particularly in a car: The windshield is a
movie," Hyde says. But the group approaches live gigs like complete
experiences, one-night installations. "The performances are very
physical spaces. Somewhere between an installation and a party. Our
favorite live performances have been the ones that have been totally
enveloping."</TE>
<TE>   Following the release of 1999's "Beaucoup Fish," which was less
revelatory than its predecessor but spawned a new dance floor staple,
"Push Upstairs," and a definitive live Underworld DVD called
"Everything, Everything," in 2000, Emerson left. "A Hundred Days Off"
makes it clear that Emerson's techno finesse is now an inextricable
part of what it means to be Underworld, whether he's there or not.</TE>
<TE>   "Darren's very particular interest in dance music was what he
passed on to Rick," Hyde says. "And the band, as a three-piece,
started to move in its own direction. It really wasn't about what
Darren was playing out anymore. The band developed its own style."</TE>
<TE>   And its own connection with the zeitgeist, producing time capsules
like the single, "Two Months Off." That, Hyde says, is the
unexplainable, the promise of electronica made real: the human
emerging from the technological.</TE>
<TE>   "When we cut loose, we react naturally. We're reacting to all the
information that we've been soaking up this year. Maybe there's a
chance for that zeitgeist to manifest because we're not trying to
write for the charts or for this year's dance trend." In other words,
not being Underworld is the best way to make sure that's exactly what
they are.</TE>

<TE>   DJ Darren Emerson</TE>
<TE>   Star DJ Darren Emerson turned Underworld toward his specialties of
wild-style techno and trance, and, some say, focused the band's
signature dance-pop crossover. A decade younger than his cohorts,
he's gone back to the decks to probe club life for new possibilities.
A look at their history:</TE>
<TE>   1991: Karl Hyde and Rick Smith, after two failed bands, recruit
Emerson to form Lemon Interrupt.</TE>
<TE>   1993: Earlier name, Underworld, is resumed on
"Dubnobasswithmyheadman," which enters British pop charts.</TE>
<TE>   1996: "Second Toughest in the Infants" and "Trainspotting"
soundtrack single "Born Slippy."</TE>
<TE>   1999: "Beaucoup Fish."</TE>
<TE>   2000: "Everything, Everything" (DVD).</TE>

<HD>Five reasons to get French Kicks</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Natalie Nichols</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>1 They have a singing drummer. At the front of the ensemble on stage,
vocalist-sticks man Nick Stumpf exudes a spastic old-school charm
that evokes Dick Dodd, crooner-beat keeper for L.A.'s "Dirty
Water"-lovin' '60s garage-rockers the Standells.</LD>
<LD>   2 They play more than one note. The 4-year-old D.C.-to-Brooklyn
quartet's debut album, "One Time Bells" (StarTime International),
provides an entertaining twist on a lot of old formulas. Various
tracks blend angular punk, jam-style garage and pulsing post-punk
with dashes of soul, California-pop harmonies and even some
Prince-like tendencies. All in 38 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   3 They are 21st century mods. C'mon, just look at 'em.</LD>
<TE>   4 They sound like the Velvet Underground, but not really. French
Kicks' tunes have a low drone and a cynical-sweet wit, but the
Velvety thing is more of a feeling. Even on forceful numbers,
Stumpf's keening vocal deadpan conjures up a cocoon-like dislocation,
and the songs fetchingly fuse gnarly noise and pretty, pretty
melodies.</TE>
<TE>   5 They mean it, maaaan. Live shows for Stumpf, his brother-bassist
Lawrence Stumpf, guitarist Matt Stinchcomb and guitarist-keyboardist
Josh Wise are less about exuding 'tude and more about delivering
gritty, hook-filled fun. Scratch up some action with them Tuesday at
the Troubadour.</TE>
<TE>   French Kicks, with No. 2 (featuring Neil Gust of Heatmeiser),
Sunshine. Troubadour, 9081 Santa Monica Blvd, W. Hollywood, $8
advance;$10 at the door, 8 p.m. (310) 276-6168.</TE>

<LD>No campaign coverage could be found on more than half of local TV
newscasts around the country, even though election day is barely a
month away, a survey released Wednesday has found.</LD>
<LD>   Of 2,454 local news programs in the country's 50 largest media
markets, 1,311 contained nothing at all on campaigns from Sept. 18 to
Oct. 4, according to the Lear Center Local News Archive.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers of the project, a collaboration between the University
of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication and the
University of Wisconsin, say it's the first such large-scale study of
local campaign coverage, so the coverage level can't be compared with
previous years.</LD>

<LD>At a Ryan Adams concert in Nashville on Tuesday, someone in the
audience yelled out a request for "Summer of '69," a hit by 1980s
rocker Bryan Adams. The singer-songwriter reacted angrily and ordered
the house lights turned on.</LD>
<LD>   He then found the fan who made the joke request, paid him $30 cash
as a refund for the show and said he wouldn't play another note until
the man left, the Tennessean newspaper reported.</LD>
<LD>   The auditorium manager stopped the fan on his way out, apologized
and allowed him back into the concert. The fan kept Adams' $30.</LD>

<LD>Luis Alfaro is finally going to see one of his own works produced by
the Mark Taper Forum, where he has worked since 1995 (not counting an
ushering stint there in the '70s). "Breakfast, Lunch &amp; Dinner" will
be part of the Taper, Too season, in April at the Ivy Substation in
Culver City.</LD>
<LD>   Plays by MacArthur Foundation grant winner Alfaro have been
produced around the country, but only two have been produced in L.A.,
both by Playwrights' Arena. Alfaro, co-director of the Taper's Latino
Theatre Initiative since 1995, and now the theater's associate
producer of new play development, said some of his Taper colleagues
"don't think of me as a working artist. And I don't push my own
agenda." But Taper producing director Robert Egan "pushed it," he
added.</LD>
<LD>   So did the Kennedy Center's Fund for New American Plays, which
recently awarded Alfaro two of its seven 2002 grants -- one for the
Taper production of "Breakfast, Lunch &amp; Dinner" and one for Tucson's
Borderlands Theater's production of Alfaro's "Electricidad."</LD>

<LD>The place</LD>
<LD>   If you want hipster swank, go to Silver Lake, but if you're
looking for pre-gentrification grunge and cryptic cool, Highland Park
is the ticket. Ask for a cup of coffee at a local bakery, and you
could be handed a jar of Nescafe. Ask for a bottle of red wine at a
liquor store, and you might be directed toward the cooler. Look in a
store window, and there could be power tools displayed along with
knitting supplies. The beauty of Highland Park is its eclecticism.
Craftsman homes dot the neighborhood, which is built alongside acres
of parks and a main drag that is alive with eateries, art galleries
and shops.</LD>
<LD>   Where to find it</LD>
<TE>   Nestled north of downtown and south of Eagle Rock, Highland Park
is bounded by South Pasadena to the east and Mount Washington to the
west.</TE>
<TE>   The main drag</TE>
<TE>   North Figueroa Street -- a hodgepodge of auto body shops,
hoochie-mama clothing stores, taco joints -- even a Buddhist temple.</TE>
<TE>   Nightlife</TE>
<TE>   On almost any night, the locus of activity is Mr. T's Bowl -- an
ancient bowling alley whose lanes were long ago replaced with a stage
for little-known bands to rock out. A couple blocks up the road is
Richard's Hofbrau, a brick-interior dive where patrons shoot pool and
knock back drinks to one of the best jukeboxes in town. In between
the two is the Highland Theater, with a trio of screens showing
first-run movies.</TE>
<TE>   Great eats</TE>
<TE>   Every block appears to have its own Mexican restaurant, but Villa
Sombrero, with margaritas as big as your head and guacamole made
before your eyes, is both fun and tasty. During the days, Ricos
Marisco's, an aqua-blue taco truck, parks along Sycamore Grove Park,
serving some of the best seafood tostadas in town. La Palapa, a
hole-in-the-wall juice joint, blends fresh fruits and veggies in
delicious combinations. And the fastest waiters in the west work at
Folliero's, delivering not the best but ridiculously cheap Italian in
an old-school pizzeria. Back at Mr. T's Bowl, twin sisters Katie and
Lecie Williams serve comfort food with a twist at the Gutter, the
tiny dinette counter they operate tucked just inside the door.</TE>
<TE>   The arts</TE>
<TE>   Highland Park was a hub of the Southern California arts-and-crafts
movement. Take a drive along Sycamore Terrace to look at some of the
area's more pristine Craftsman-era residences. Judson Studios has
been making stained glass for the better part of a century, and its
gallery is open to the public. On a more modern tip, several art
galleries have sprung up recently, including the drive-by window
space, Oranges and Sardines.</TE>
<TE>   History</TE>
<TE>   Named for its rolling hills and elevation, Highland Park was
grazing land for sheep and cattle until the area was developed in the
1880s, at which point a community of artists, writers and
intellectuals moved in. Among them was Charles Lummis, who walked
from Cincinnati to L.A. in 1884 and settled in the area. His estate,
the Lummis Home, is now a museum. The opening of the Arroyo Seco
Parkway in 1940 ushered in the era of the freeway, prompting
residents to move to the suburbs and causing the neighborhood to fall
into disrepair. Architecturally significant homes were replaced with
apartment buildings in the '50s, '60s and '70s, attracting a
lower-income element. In 1982, the Highland Park Heritage Trust was
organized to preserve the area's architecture. The neighborhood is
now the largest historic district in L.A., with 60 local sites on the
City's Historic Cultural Monument List -- most of them private
residences.</TE>

<HD>Drawing on irony and humor</HD>
<DH>David Rees' brutally honest, off-color comic strip about
America in the wake of Sept. 11 will be made into a book.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Carpenter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was three weeks after Sept. 11, and David Rees was sitting at his
computer feeling "insignificant and stupid." The 29-year-old New York
City temp worker was about to be laid off, dust from the World Trade
Center buildings was still swirling in the air, and the U.S. was just
starting to drop bombs in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Times were strange. Rees felt strange, so he channeled his
disillusionment into "Get Your War On," a searingly witty online
comic strip bristling with irreverence and a brutally honest point of
view about what was going on.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh my God, this War on Terrorism is gonna rule!" a bespectacled
office worker tells a friend in Rees' first strip. "I can't wait
until the war is over and there's no more terrorism!"</LD>
<TE>   "I know!" the friend answers. "Remember when the U.S. had a drug
problem, and then we declared a War on Drugs, and now you can't buy
drugs anymore? It'll be just like that!"</TE>
<TE>   Rees' first posting was Oct. 9, 2001, when American flags were
flying from nearly every car, home and high-rise in an unbridled
display of patriotism. Yet many people were confused, scared, uneasy.
Rees' comic struck a nerve.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks after posting it and sending the link to some friends,
the "Get Your War On" Web page (www.mnftiu.net) had gotten 5 million
hits. It has received 20 million more since then. This month, Soft
Skull Press is publishing the comic strip series as a book.</TE>
<TE>   "No one was really talking about how horrible it was about to get
in Afghanistan," says Rees, who continues to update the site every
few weeks with new panels. "I wanted to make jokes that would churn
up that anxiety and try to provoke a really serious human response to
the complexity of the situation."</TE>
<TE>   And churn it did, prompting about 1,500 e-mails from readers. Most
have been from fans, praising Rees for helping them cope with what
continues to be an exceptionally odd and difficult time. Some have
been from readers accusing him of being anti-American. There are even
occasional death threats -- all because Rees spoke out at a time when
many were too afraid to give voice to their anger and confusion.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Rees' inspiration came from Vanity Fair editor Graydon
Carter, who, shortly after 9/11, proclaimed that irony was dead.</TE>
<TE>   "It ticked me off that these cultural elite were so eager to make
pronouncements about the future of American culture when the dust,
literally, hadn't even settled," says Rees, who holds a philosophy
degree from Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio. "It seemed snobby and
ignoring the human capacity to ... use humor as a resistance to
horror."</TE>
<TE>   Rees believed in the power of pop culture to respond to crisis. He
grew up listening to the Minutemen, an L.A. punk band whose music was
infused with political irony. He watched comedians like Richard Pryor
and Lenny Bruce, who used personal traumas to make light of dark
situations.</TE>
<TE>   Though he admired political artwork and satire, he had never tried
it before and wasn't sure his would work. He started with a telephone
conversation he had with a friend while working as a fact checker for
Maxim magazine, dropping expletive- and exclamation-heavy dialogue
into bubbles floating over clip-art characters' heads. The banal,
black-and-white images of office workers accented the blunt and
biting narrative to hilarious effect.</TE>
<TE>   Rees had used clip art for a previous comic, a device he developed
while working as a temp.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing to do, but I couldn't draw at my desk," said
Rees, who, despite the popularity of his comic, continues to temp
today. Rees, who "just wanted to make jokes," soon discovered that
"with clip art, you could make the jokes come quicker."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every page of "Get Your War On" is packed with off-color
humor that can be both laugh-out-loud funny and gut-wrenchingly sick,
like the strip he posted last November:</TE>
<TE>   "Mommeeee! Why is this little boy all ... blown up and mutilated
with no arms? Didn't he get the dollar I sent him?" Or the panel he
posted in March:</TE>
<TE>   "How psyched is George W. Bush to defeat Saddam Hussein for his
dad? George H.W. Bush is gonna be SO ... proud of his son! He'll
probably put Saddam's death certificate on the fridge! I was a C
student."</TE>
<TE>   In the book, each comic is marked with the date when Rees posted
it on his site, making the series read like a diary of the last
year's events.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted it to be a token of the last year," says Rees.
"Something you could buy and tuck away for a really long time, then
look at years later."</TE>

<LD>What was the bigger joke of the 2000 presidential election: Al Gore's
claims of victory or George Bush's prevailing? No matter your answer,
there's no dispute that the whole fiasco was a rich source of humor.</LD>
<LD>   There's also no denying that the balloting irregularities and
court battles led many to reexamine the voting process.</LD>
<LD>   "Who Counts? Election Reform in America," a new documentary on
KCET at 10 tonight, tries to blend comedy with a sobering look at
suffrage, but it ends up being an unsatisfying mishmash. It allows
neither the impressionist talents of "Saturday Night Live's" Darrell
Hammond nor the news skills of former CNN Washington bureau chief
Frank Sesno to shine. Hammond delivers his jokes via a trio of
characters: Bill Clinton, Gore and Dick Cheney. His Cheney fares the
worst, declaring: "In voter turnout, America has now climbed to No.
120 out of 169 nations. We've left Mexico in our wake, and we're hot
on the heels of the Dominican Republic. So I think it's obvious that
we've got a system that works."</LD>
<TE>   Sesno's reporting shows that it doesn't work, or at least not as
well as it should, but his squarish delivery clashes with the loud
graphics and MTV-style interviews meant to juice things up.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its late time slot, "Who Counts?" seems aimed at primarily
young viewers. But the show's patronizing tone may leave them asking,
"Who cares?"</TE>

<LD>   Warner, $23</LD>
<TE>   Always expect the unexpected from writer-director Christopher
Nolan. Last year he scored a big indie hit with "Memento," a gritty
film noir that unfolded in reverse order. Even the special-edition
DVD of the film was offbeat -- one had to solve a series of puzzles
to unlock the extras on the double disc.</TE>
<TE>   Although his latest film, "Insomnia," is a far more conventional
thriller, the young Englishman has done something decidedly different
with his commentary track for the Al Pacino-Robin Williams summer
hit. He offers his insights into the making of the film noir in the
order the film was shot. This unusual take on the commentary gives
viewers a rare glimpse into how films are shot out of sequence and
just how on their toes actors must be to handle distinct shifts in
their characters' personalities from one day to the next.</TE>
<TE>   Other interesting extras include commentary from co-star Hilary
Swank and from the writer, the editor, the cinematographer and the
production designer.</TE>
<TE>   "Gangster No. 1"</TE>
<TE>   Stars Malcolm McDowell</TE>
<TE>   MGM, $23</TE>
<TE>   This gritty, British-made gangster flick recalls such English film
noir classics as Mike Hodges' 1971 "Get Carter." Sharply directed by
Paul McGuigan, "Gangster No. 1" tells the story of the rise of a
ruthless London mob boss. Malcolm McDowell, in one of his best
performances in recent years, plays the gangster in middle age, and a
terrifying Paul Bettany is his younger self. The DVD includes a
passable "making of" documentary, a deleted scene and commentary from
McGuigan.</TE>
<TE>   "Saturday Night Fever"</TE>
<TE>   Stars John Travolta</TE>
<TE>   Paramount, $24</TE>
<TE>   John Travolta went from Sweathog to movie superstar with his
remarkable performance in this 1977 classic that brought disco out
from the underground and into mainstream culture. With his blow-dried
hair, gold chains, boots and polyester outfits, Travolta, then 23,
was a revelation as a 19-year-old Brooklyn resident who worked in a
paint store by day but became king of his local disco every Saturday
night.</TE>
<TE>   The soundtrack, which featured such Bee Gees tunes as "Stayin'
Alive," became one of the biggest sellers in recording history. And
Travolta received his first Oscar nomination.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD features a nice wide-screen edition of the film, three
deleted scenes, highlights from the "Saturday Night Fever"
installment of VH1's "Behind the Music" and terrific commentary from
director John Badham.</TE>
<TE>   "American Idol: The Search for a Superstar"</TE>
<TE>   With winner Kelly Clarkson and Simon Cowell</TE>
<TE>   StudioWorks Entertainment, $15, VHS; $20, DVD</TE>
<TE>   The hourlong video features several numbers sung by the 10
finalists.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD has that plus an extra hour of backstage footage that
includes a blooper reel and way too many "cute" moments between hosts
Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman.</TE>

<HD>AMR Reports $924-Million Loss</HD>
<DH>American Airlines' parent expects fourth quarter's results
to be worse than the third's.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American Airlines parent AMR Corp., besieged by the travel slump and
excessive operating costs, said Wednesday that it lost nearly $1
billion in the third quarter and that the current quarter is also
poor. AMR's stock tumbled 13% in response.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's largest carrier -- which has announced several
cost-cutting steps in recent weeks, including job cuts of 7,000 --
unveiled more measures to further pare expenses. They include
deferring delivery of 34 new Boeing Co. jetliners and placing 42
existing planes in storage.</LD>
<LD>   The loss of $924 million, equal to $5.93 a share, was more than
double the $414-million loss, or $2.68 a share, in the year-earlier
quarter, when American and the other airlines were grounded after the
terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "Any way you look at them, these are terrible financial results,"
AMR Chairman Donald Carty said in a statement, adding that "the
environment shows little sign of improving."</TE>
<TE>   American, based in Fort Worth, and the other airlines are enduring
one of their worst crises in history. Lingering effects from the
attacks -- including reduced passenger demand, low fares, higher fuel
prices and soaring insurance and security costs -- are leaving the
carriers with far too little income to cover their expenses.</TE>
<TE>   AMR's revenue was hit especially hard because of its widespread
service to lackluster Latin American markets and because it's a major
carrier of business travelers, who have increasingly sought lower
fares or reduced flying during the sluggish economy.</TE>
<TE>   AMR said its loss included after-tax charges totaling $449
million, which mainly reflected severance packages for laid-off
workers and write-downs in the values of American's aircraft.
Excluding those charges, AMR's operating profit was $475 million, or
$3.05 a share, in line with Wall Street's forecasts. AMR's
third-quarter revenue fell 7% to $4.5 billion from $4.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The airline said it "expects to post a sizable operating loss in
the fourth quarter, most likely exceeding the third-quarter loss
before special items." AMR's stock plummeted 59 cents to $3.89 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, United Airlines parent UAL Corp. said it would not
hold its normal quarterly conference call with analysts and the media
Friday when it reports its third-quarter results. UAL, which faces a
cash crunch that the airline says could land United in Bankruptcy
Court, said it's not ready to elaborate on its effort to quickly
develop a recovery plan.</TE>
<TE>   UAL is negotiating with its unions on wage cuts and other
concessions as part of the plan, so that it can secure a $1.8-billion
loan backed by the federal government. But the airline warned that "a
Chapter 11 filing can't be ruled out."</TE>

<HD>Andersen Sentenced to $500,000 Fine, 5 Years of Probation</HD>
<DH>A judge hands out the maximum penalty in the Enron-related
obstruction case. The firm says it's not guilty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lianne Hart and Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>HOUSTON -- Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm once revered for its
commitment to integrity, was sentenced to the maximum $500,000 fine
and five years' probation Wednesday for obstructing a federal inquiry
into the collapse of former client Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The Chicago-based accounting giant had previously surrendered its
licenses to audit financial statements and retains fewer than 1,000
U.S. employees, down from 28,000 before the obstruction charge.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors accused the firm of destroying Enron-related documents
in an attempt to keep information from federal securities regulators.
A Houston jury convicted the firm, but several jurors said later that
they rendered the verdict because they believed an Andersen in-house
attorney had asked a Houston-based partner to alter a memo, not shred
it.</LD>
<TE>   "We will go to our graves saying we were not guilty," Andersen's
lawyer, Rusty Hardin, told the judge. Hardin said the firm intends to
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon said the "maximum fine is
warranted to send the message to the auditing community that the
destruction of documents will not be tolerated.... The full impact of
Andersen's conduct will never be known because many of the documents
could not be recovered."</TE>
<TE>   Harmon ordered the firm to retain all documents from its audits of
Enron and other clients. She also said Andersen could not dissolve
itself without first obtaining her approval.</TE>
<TE>   In asking Harmon to impose a heavy sentence, Assistant U.S. Atty.
Samuel Buell cited the firm's questionable audits of other clients,
including trash hauler Waste Management Inc. and American Tissue
Inc., a New York paper products maker. American Tissue filed for
bankruptcy protection last year.</TE>
<TE>   Buell said outside court that the American Tissue matter remains
under investigation, but he alleged that an Andersen partner had
directed destruction of documents related to the firm's audit of the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton expressed outrage that Buell
cited the case. "No one has concluded that anyone did anything
wrong," Dorton said. "It is morally and ethically irresponsible ...
to spew out random allegations."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has all but disintegrated since prosecutors indicted the
firm in March. The firm once had 111 U.S. offices but now has only
three with "critical mass," Dorton said. Nonetheless, the firm has
vowed to stave off bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Caldwell, chief of the federal task force overseeing the
Enron probe, said Andersen employees shouldn't blame the Justice
Department for decimating the firm. "They need to look at their
management," Caldwell said. "The government did not destroy Arthur
Andersen. Arthur Andersen's management destroyed Arthur Andersen."</TE>

<HD>Fall Classic a Tourism Industry Hit</HD>
<DH>With two California ballclubs vying in the World Series,
sports marketing experts see economic lift extending beyond the games</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bonnie Harris</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During the broadcast of the last National League championship game in
San Francisco, when the Giants beat the St. Louis Cardinals and
earned a trip to the World Series, a sunset shot over the bay
prompted TV announcer Tim McCarver to gush: "Isn't this the most
beautiful place on Earth?"</LD>
<LD>   About 500 miles away in Palm Springs, sports marketing expert
Rolfe Shellenberger heard McCarver's words and thought one thing: big
dollars for the city of San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   "That alone is worth millions," Shellenberger said of the offhand
remark. "Say it and they will come."</LD>
<TE>   With two California teams -- the Giants and the Anaheim Angels --
playing in the World Series, state and local officials are counting
on a nice economic lift from the Fall Classic, which starts Saturday
in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, some of the biggest gains may stem not from direct
spending by fans and out-of-towners, but from the kind of free
advertising that comes from comments like McCarver's and the
panoramic images of the two cities that will inevitably help fill
time between innings.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of an immediate windfall, economic development experts
say that San Francisco and Anaheim can each expect to take in about
$10 million a day from the surge of visitors associated with the
World Series. That's nothing compared with what the Super Bowl --
which is played on neutral turf and thus guaranteed to fill hotel
rooms -- brings in: about $250 million. Nor does it compare to the
Rose Bowl on New Year's Day, which showers the local economy with
$200 million annually.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Lisa Delpy, a professor of sports marketing and tourism
studies at George Washington University, believes such raw figures
miss the point.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people don't remember where the Super Bowl was played last
year, but they can probably tell you who won the World Series," Delpy
said. "With this event comes name recognition and a sense of place.
You can't put a price on that kind of status."</TE>
<TE>   The way Shellenberger, figures things, televised platitudes such
as McCarver's are each worth about 10 seconds of visual exposure
during high-profile sporting events. Given that a 30-second
commercial during the playoffs cost about $100,000, tourism officials
in San Francisco got handed $33,000 of free advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim and San Francisco have already enjoyed precious time in
the national spotlight. Both cities' visitors bureaus have reported
increases in requests for tourism information since the playoffs
began, and have adjusted their Web sites to focus almost exclusively
on the only game in town.</TE>
<TE>   Officials are banking on carefully edited video footage of their
respective cities -- to be aired as filler images during the games --
and a flurry of advertising in each other's newspapers to help draw
crowds to their cities. The goal is to entice even those who can't
get tickets, but want to be close to the action.</TE>
<TE>   About 75% of the seats at both ball parks will go to season ticket
holders, corporate sponsors and VIPs, leaving about 10,000 tickets up
for grabs at each game, officials said. Face value of the tickets
runs about $125, but brokers are selling outfield seats for
Saturday's game in Anaheim for $450 apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Already, officials in both cities have dubbed it "The I-5 Series"
in anticipation of the fans who will keep the freeway hot between
Anaheim and San Francisco over the next week.</TE>
<TE>   The Anaheim Hilton will have 10-inch ads in the San Francisco
Chronicle beginning today, congratulating the Giants and inviting
fans to "come stay with us" in Anaheim for $149 per night, said Edd
Karlan, director of sales and marketing. Karlan expects the World
Series will bring at least a 10% increase in business to the
1,600-room property.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to do well in Anaheim because our games are all
weekend games," he said. "And yes, we're hoping to go the full six
and seven games. A long, drawn-out series will be much better for
us."</TE>
<TE>   For San Francisco, a city that continues to struggle with low
hotel occupancy rates, a tourism slump and the aftermath of the
dot-com bust, landing in the World Series couldn't have come at a
better time, said Lee Blitch, president of the San Francisco Chamber
of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, with San Francisco in the running to host the 2012
Olympics--competing against New York for the U.S. bid--Blitch is
already anticipating that the Series will have a big effect. "We got
the World Series, which will in turn help us get the Olympics,"
Blitch said. "Everything in between is simply butter."</TE>
<TE>   California tourism officials also plan to maximize the state's
exposure during the World Series. They intend to run the popular
campaign featuring celebrities such as Jack Nicholson and Clint
Eastwood urging folks to "find yourself here."</TE>
<TE>   Although it's unclear how many tourists are lured to a city after
watching sporting events, many marketing experts suspect the number
is significant--particularly when it comes to baseball fans. The
World Series tends to include more city vistas and tourist
information in its broadcast coverage than do Super Bowls because
they're not usually hosted in either team's home town, or basketball
championships, which are played indoors.</TE>
<TE>   "You may not have the champagne and caviar crowds like you do with
some of the other events, but you have staying power with the World
Series," said Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles County
Economic Development Corp. "People remember those images. They don't
go away when the game's over."</TE>

<HD>Boeing Profit Falls 43% as Jet Deliveries Decline</HD>
<DH>Amid a commercial aircraft slump, the company also expects
its satellite business, much of which is handled in Southern
California, to remain sluggish.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Pae</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Battered by a slump in the commercial aircraft business, Boeing Co.
reported sharply lower third-quarter earnings Wednesday and
acknowledged that a downturn in the airline industry could well last
through 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Boeing Chairman Philip Condit also predicted that the
Chicago-based company's commercial satellite and rocket launch
business would remain sluggish for the foreseeable future. Much of
Boeing's satellite and rocket work is handled in Southern California,
where its space and communications unit is the largest private
employer.</LD>
<LD>   The aerospace giant's net income declined nearly 43% for the three
months ended Sept. 30 to $372 million, or 46 cents a share, from $650
million, or 80 cents, a year earlier. Revenue fell 7% to $12.7
billion from $13.7 billion.</LD>
<TE>   The falloff at Boeing's commercial aircraft operations was
especially steep. Revenue for the unit dropped nearly $2 billion to
$6.1 billion. Boeing delivered 73 jets in the quarter, a 39% drop
compared with the year-earlier quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange trading, Boeing shares
fell $1.65 to $30.50 on the heels of the earnings report.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a very dramatically changed business environment,"
Condit said Wednesday in a conference call with analysts. "The
downturn is severe."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Boeing said it was lowering its production forecast for
2003 and said demand for commercial aircraft could continue to
decline through the end of 2004, a year longer than its earlier
estimate. The grim outlook had been expected by analysts.</TE>
<TE>   It also didn't surprise hundreds of Boeing suppliers in Southern
California, who have been struggling with shrinking orders for parts
all year.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the industry are concerned that a prolonged slump could
ignite a major shakeout among small- to medium-sized contractors,
particularly those heavily dependent on commercial aircraft orders.</TE>
<TE>   Most Boeing suppliers have weathered the downturn by slashing jobs
and trying to boost defense-related work, but "there is going to be
increasing inexorable pressure on these guys," said Ross K. Anderson,
a principal director of Janes Capital Partners, an Irvine aerospace
investment bank. "They can't hold out two or three years."</TE>
<TE>   Since last year's terrorist attacks, air travel has remained
anemic and has put major U.S. airlines in a severe financial crunch.
Although major airlines aren't canceling orders, they're not placing
new ones. They also have taken many planes out of service and have
pushed back deliveries of new jets.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with this weak demand, Boeing said aircraft production in
2003 is likely to be in the range of 275 to 285 new jets, rather than
its previous forecast of 275 to 300. Boeing delivered more than 500
new airplanes last year.</TE>
<TE>   With lower orders, Boeing projected that revenue and operating
margins also would be lower than previously expected. The company
reduced next year's revenue forecast to $50 billion from $52 billion
and expects profit margins to shrink to 6.5% from 8.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing's space and communications unit, with major operations in
El Segundo, Seal Beach and Huntington Beach, reported a third-quarter
loss of $36 million, compared with a $181-million profit in the
previous year. The satellite business, hurt by a downturn in the
telecommunications industry, has cut 1,900 jobs in El Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   "Commercial satellite and launch businesses may be several years
from recovery," Condit said.</TE>
<TE>   One bright spot in the earnings report was Boeing's military and
aircraft business. The U.S. has increased defense spending in the
wake of the terrorist attacks and for military action in Afghanistan.
The trend is expected to continue as the U.S. prepares for possible
war on Iraq. Revenue at Boeing's military aircraft and missile
systems business rose 14% to $3.8 billion, mainly due to increased
orders for precision bomb kits and military transports such as the
C-17 jet, assembled in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, TRW Inc., which is being acquired by Northrop Grumman
Corp. for $7.8 billion, posted a profit in the third quarter after
incurring heavy losses a year earlier, mainly because of a boost in
defense spending that bolstered its Redondo Beach-based military
space and missile defense operations.</TE>
<TE>   Net income was $13 million, or 10 cents a share, as contrasted
with a loss of $57 million, or 65 cents, a year earlier when TRW took
a charge for discontinuing a commercial satellite program. Earnings
from continuing operations rose to $115 million, or 89 cents, from
$80 million, or 64 cents. Revenue climbed 10% to $3.95 billion from
$3.59 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop said Wednesday that U.S. regulators were still reviewing
the proposed acquisition of TRW, but the company said it was
confident the deal could be closed by year-end.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop, which is set to report earnings today, cleared a key
hurdle Wednesday when the European Union OKd the deal.</TE>

<HD>City National Trims Year's Profit Forecast</HD>
<DH>The bank posts a solid third quarter, but looming loan
problems are cause for concern.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. Scott Reckard</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>City National Corp. said Wednesday that third-quarter profit rose
nearly 30%, but it trimmed its forecast for full-year earnings growth
as it increased its provisions for troubled loans.</LD>
<LD>   The bank, based in Beverly Hillls, earned $48.7 million, or 94
cents a share, compared with $37.5 million, or 75 cents a share, a
year earlier. Adjusted for an accounting change, year-earlier
earnings were $40.7 million, or 82 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   City National has recorded increases in deposits, loans and profit
despite the weak economy, Chairman Russell Goldsmith said.</LD>
<TE>   But even though lending this year will grow 15% to 16%, loan
growth slowed in the third quarter, City National said. It revised
its upper estimate of earnings growth for 2002 to 10% from 11%.</TE>
<TE>   The bank wrote off $19 million in loans as uncollectable in the
third quarter, compared with $6.6 million in the third quarter of
2001. Provisions for bad loans will total $65 million to $75 million
this year, the bank said, up from earlier estimates of $45 million.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expected City National to earn 89 cents a share.
Excluding a one-time tax benefit of $4.6 million, profit would have
been 86 cents to 87 cents, said Putnam Lovell Securities analyst
Jacqueline Reeves, who rates the bank "hold" because of worries about
loan quality.</TE>
<TE>   City National shares fell $5.01, or 10.5%, to $42.86 on the New
York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Newport Beach thrift Downey Financial Corp. said
third-quarter profit fell 33% to $14.5 million, or 52 cents a share,
from $21.8 million, or 77 cents a share, as mortgage refinancings
eroded the value of its home-loan servicing business.</TE>
<TE>   Downey's shares fell 26 cents to $36 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Troubled Dynegy to Exit Energy-Trading Business</HD>
<DH>The Texas firm, vilified during the California energy
crisis, also warns of significant job cuts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dynegy Inc., accused by state officials of price gouging in the
California electricity market, said Wednesday that it would abandon
energy trading to conserve cash and restructure its remaining
operations to adapt to a post-Enron Corp. world.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, Dynegy President Steve Bergstrom resigned, becoming
the third top executive to leave the Houston energy company in the
last six months. Bergstrom built the trading business into a
powerhouse only to watch it deteriorate -- along with Dynegy's stock
price -- in recent months with the rest of the energy-trading
industry.</LD>
<LD>   Dynegy also warned of a "significant work force reduction," with
analysts estimating that the cuts could number as high as 1,000 out
of 5,500 employees. The company dismissed 340 in June.</LD>
<TE>   California is seeking $9 billion in refunds from Dynegy and other
power sellers for alleged overcharges during the electricity crisis
of 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy owns power plants in the Golden State capable of producing
more than 1,500 megawatts of electricity -- enough to supply 1.1
million typical homes -- in a partnership with NRG Energy, a
subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc. of Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   The taint of trading scandals, stubbornly low power prices and a
general tightening of credit for energy merchants have turned most of
the traders into cash-starved, penny-stock firms.</TE>
<TE>   Only Enron has filed for U.S. Bankruptcy Court protection, but
other firms are thought to be teetering on the edge, propped up only
by the continuing indulgence of creditors. Several other major
trading firms, including Williams Cos. of Tulsa, Okla., and El Paso
Corp. of Houston, have cut back their trading operations sharply.</TE>
<TE>   Investors were not impressed by Dynegy's restructuring, pushing
the company's stock down 27 cents, or 25%, to 81 cents on the New
York Stock Exchange. Dynegy's stock sold for as much as $47.20 in the
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Dynegy is trying to save something here," said Jon Kyle
Cartwright, senior energy analyst with Raymond James &amp; Associates.
"It's very easy to close an operation that's not making any money for
you and is firmly in a business that, for all intents and purposes,
is dead."</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy, which had been unsuccessfully seeking a partner for its
trading business, said it would focus on running its unregulated
power plants, its regulated utility Illinois Power, its natural gas
liquids business and a telecommunications venture, making each a
stand-alone operation within the corporation.</TE>
<TE>   Although the company is ending speculative energy trading, it will
continue to sell the production from its power plants and natural gas
operations, spokesman David Byford said.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy said it would continue to market virtually all of the
natural gas produced in the U.S. by ChevronTexaco Corp. of San
Francisco, which owns 26% of Dynegy.</TE>
<TE>   "We fully expect that Dynegy will continue to fulfill its con-
tractual obligations," ChevronTexaco spokesman Fred Gorell said.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy's moves Wednesday marked a dubious anniversary: Exactly one
year earlier, Enron announced a surprise loss and the write-off of
$1.2 billion in shareholder equity because the company was taking
back onto its balance sheet some of the questionable partnerships
that would later push it into filing for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy, Enron's smaller cross-town rival, sought to rescue it in
November but backed out of a merger when the depths of Enron's
problems became evident.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's meltdown changed everything for energy merchants, which
had tried to emulate its model of a nimble trader that could profit
in any kind of market and that had little use for hard assets, such
as power plants and pipelines, said analyst Aaron Tyler of Reed
Wasden &amp; Associates, an investment banking firm in Bellevue, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   "There is just no real assurance for investors that anything will
survive," Tyler said, estimating that Dynegy would free up about $500
million in cash by pulling out of energy trading. The company has
$1.6 billion in debt coming due by May.</TE>
<TE>   "This buys them a little bit of time," Tyler said. "I wish I could
say one way or another that Dynegy will survive, but so much is
dependent on the banks."</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy spokesman Byford denied that the company's restructuring
into a more decentralized corporate form is a prelude to asset sales
or a bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   "We're restructuring to run our businesses and to run our company
more efficiently," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy's headaches have included probes into accounting
transactions and bogus, or "round-trip," energy trades. The firm's
woes helped push Chief Executive Chuck Watson out the door in May and
Chief Financial Officer Rob Doty in June.</TE>
<TE>   The company recently paid $3 million to the Securities and
Exchange Commission to settle an accounting dispute over a natural
gas venture.</TE>

<HD>El Paso Corp. Lawsuit Can Proceed</HD>
<DH>A California judge says the gas firm and Sempra units can
stand trial on allegations they added to the state's energy crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christine Hanley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A California judge ruled Wednesday that El Paso Corp., Southern
California Gas and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric can be brought to trial
in a civil suit alleging that they contributed to the state's energy
crisis by carving up the natural gas market and killing key pipeline
projects that would have brought more and cheaper gas to consumers.</LD>
<LD>   "The allegations of a conspiracy involving the El Paso defendants,
which violated the state antitrust laws and unfair competition laws,
are adequately pled," San Diego Superior Court Judge Richard Haden
wrote in his four-page decision. "To the extent plaintiffs can prove
their allegations they may be entitled to damages, restitution or
disgorgement."</LD>
<LD>   El Paso and its co-defendants have denied wrongdoing and have been
trying for two years to get the case dismissed. The firms contend
that the federal government has sole authority over the case and the
ongoing investigation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
into El Paso's pipeline operations preempts state legal actions.</LD>
<TE>   But Haden found that state antitrust laws do not conflict with
federal law.</TE>
<TE>   "Simply put, FERC cannot adjudicate this claim," he said.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso could not be reached for comment late Wednesday. Denise
King, a spokeswoman for Southern California Gas, said her company and
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric are disappointed in the ruling and said the
lawsuit itself "overlooks critical facts, relies on false speculation
and has absolutely no merit." The companies are subsidiaries of
Sempra Energy.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the plaintiffs say they intend to force high-ranking
energy executives to testify under oath about a 1996 meeting in a
Phoenix hotel room. At that meeting, lawyers claim, the firms plotted
to divide up California's energy market and exclude cheaper Canadian
gas from Southern California Gas. Under the alleged plan, El Paso
agreed to kill a Canadian pipeline project, which would have competed
with pipelines operated by Southern California Gas and SDG&amp;E. In
exchange, Southern California Gas withdrew a bid for a pipeline
project that it could have completed for significantly less money
than El Paso, which also was bidding on the project.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit alleges that Al Clark, El Paso vice president of
marketing and operations, took notes at the meeting. As a consequence
of the deal made at that meeting, the suit claims, natural gas prices
soared up to 20 times their normal ranges at times during the
California energy crisis in 2000 and 2001, costing consumers billions
of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't wait to depose Clark," said Carole E. Handler, a lead
attorney for the plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   A preliminary trial date of Sept. 4, 2003, has been set.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, FERC administrative law judge Curtis L. Wagner ruled
that El Paso's failure to operate at "maximum allowable operating
pressure" was key evidence of a scheme to manipulate the California
energy market. The ruling was hailed as a breakthrough in efforts to
hold industry players accountable for damages to California
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso is appealing Wagner's decision to the full FERC board,
which is slated to hear the appeal next month.</TE>

<HD>Ford Posts a Loss of $326 Million for Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Porretto</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. posted a $326-million loss in the third quarter
Wednesday, but its results before one-time expenses topped Wall
Street predictions--just as rival General Motors Corp. did a day
earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The world's two largest automakers also face similar concerns over
mounting pension liabilities. Such worries on Wednesday prompted
Standard &amp; Poor's to lower GM's long-term credit rating and announce
that it was reviewing Ford's rating to see if it should be lowered.</LD>
<LD>   The major automakers have seen their share prices battered in
recent weeks on concerns about industry growth and the overall
economic picture. To compete for customers in the sluggish economy,
Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler unit continue to offer
lucrative incentives, squeezing profits.</LD>
<TE>   Ford's loss of 18 cents a share in the quarter largely reflected
losses related to the sale of its European vehicle repair business,
Kwik-Fit. The No. 2 automaker lost $692 million, or 39 cents a share,
in the year-earlier period.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue rose 9% to $39.6 billion from $36.3 billion. Vehicle sales
also rose 9%, to 1.65 million units.</TE>
<TE>   "The fundamentals of our business are improving, as evidenced by
increases in our revenue and vehicle sales, improvements in our
market share and tangible progress on cost efficiencies," Chairman
and Chief Executive Bill Ford said. "While we're pleased with our
progress, we continue our work with a strong sense of urgency to
restore our business to its full potential."</TE>
<TE>   Excluding a $525-million charge related to Kwik-Fit and other
one-time expenses, Ford had an operating profit of $220 million, or
12 cents a share, contrasted with a loss last year of $502 million,
or 28 cents.</TE>
<TE>   The consensus forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call
was that Ford would earn 3 cents a share from operations in the
latest quarter.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, shares of Ford and GM fell nearly 7% in trading on
the New York Stock Exchange. Ford shares fell 61 cents to $8.26, and
GM lost $2.56 to $34.14.</TE>

<HD>Global Creditors May Go After Winnick's Money</HD>
<DH>Group asks founder and chairman of the fiber-optic cable
company to step down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Douglass</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Global Crossing Ltd. creditors' group asked longtime Chairman Gary
Winnick on Wednesday to resign from the telecommunications company he
founded and said it may try to tap the billionaire philanthropist's
personal fortune to recoup corporate funds.</LD>
<LD>   The request, made by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court committee of
unsecured creditors, marks the first time that anyone has formally
sought the ouster of Winnick from Global Crossing, which filed for
bankruptcy protection in January after incurring billions of dollars
of debt while building a worldwide fiber-optic network.</LD>
<LD>   Winnick and Global Crossing have maintained an uneasy bond in the
face of investigations into the company's books and Winnick's stock
sales, as well as harsh criticism from shareholders and laid-off
employees who watched Winnick continue his lavish personal spending
-- and giving -- as their stock became worthless.</LD>
<TE>   If the creditors have their way, Winnick, 54, would no longer have
a say in Global Crossing's operations.</TE>
<TE>   "The committee has questioned the propriety of Winnick's continued
role with the company," said attorney Edward Weisfelner, who
represents the unsecured creditors group. "There are a host of
reasons for the decision. First and foremost is that the committee
may have claims and causes of action against him."</TE>
<TE>   In Winnick's case, the committee could pursue reimbursement or
compensation from him for any acts of corporate waste, excessive
compensation, mismanagement or breach of fiduciary duty -- or some
combination of those claims. Winnick has been criticized for
encouraging lavish executive pay packages and perks.</TE>
<TE>   Weisfelner said the committee outlined its position in a letter
sent Wednesday to attorneys representing Global Crossing's board.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing executives could not confirm receipt of the
committee's letter late Wednesday. Winnick spokesman Scott Tagliarino
said only that "as chairman of the board, Gary has committed himself
to helping Global Crossing through its restructuring, and he will
continue in that role at the discretion of the board of directors."</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton, Bermuda-based Global Crossing, which had offices in
Beverly Hills, operates a worldwide fiber-optic network that remains
the largest of its kind. Battered by the combination of massive debt
and an industry-wide slump, the company filed for Bankruptcy Court
protection on Jan. 28, listing $22.4 billion in assets and $12.4
billion in debts.</TE>
<TE>   The creditors' request is binding on neither the company nor its
board of directors, and it is not clear whether the board could strip
Winnick of his chairmanship without a shareholder vote, experts say.
But Weisfelner said he is "cautiously optimistic" that Winnick will
indeed leave the company. Bankruptcy and corporate governance experts
agree.</TE>
<TE>   "The company and the board knows that it has to work with the
creditors committee to get the reorganization to go smoothly," said
attorney Jerry Reisman of Reisman Peirez &amp; Reisman, a bankruptcy firm
representing some Global Crossing creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick has been Global Crossing's chairman since its founding in
1997, but the rest of the board has been unstable. More than 30
directors have served the company over five years. In addition to
Winnick, Global Crossing's current six-member board includes longtime
Winnick friend Lodwrick Cook as co-chairman, Global Crossing Chief
Executive John Legere and three newly appointed independent
directors.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the Department of Labor are investigating allegations that Global
Crossing used misleading accounting practices to mask the company's
deteriorating condition. Winnick, in particular, has been under
scrutiny because he sold nearly $124 million worth of stock in May
2001, shortly before the company publicly announced that lagging
sales would hurt its financial results.</TE>

<HD>Home Prices Surge Again in September</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daryl Strickland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home prices in the Southland's two biggest markets posted a
surprisingly large increase in September.</LD>
<LD>   The median price in Orange County surged 20% from a year earlier
to $368,000, just off its all-time high of $370,000 set in August,
according to a report released Wednesday by DataQuick Information
Systems Inc. The number of homes sold rose 3% to 3,848.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles County, the median price for homes jumped 16.5%,
equaling its all-time high of $269,000 set in June. Sales increased
5% to 9,362.</LD>
<TE>   Industry experts who have been predicting a slowdown, both for
seasonal and economic reasons, were amazed by September's activity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's surprising that price appreciation has continued as high as
it has, as long as it has," said Robert Reicher, an analyst at Market
Profiles, a Costa Mesa firm that tracks real estate trends. "I think
everyone still expects things to slow down in terms of prices, but it
hasn't happened yet."</TE>
<TE>   The continuing robust market, boosted in large part by the lowest
mortgage rates in decades and a small supply of new and existing
units on the market, is paying off handsomely for homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   Median-priced homes in Los Angeles County have gained $3,167 a
month in equity over the last year and $5,250 a month in Orange
County, DataQuick said.</TE>
<TE>   Those increases have helped some buyers move into newer, larger
homes.</TE>
<TE>   At Ladera Ranch, a master-planned community in south Orange
County, builders this month sold 120 of 122 homes in less than an
hour. The two others were sold later that week.</TE>
<TE>   The sales pace shows "no sign of letting up," said Anne Marie
Moiso, marketing director at Rancho Mission Viejo, Ladera Ranch's
developer.</TE>
<TE>   Les Thomas, president of Shea Homes of Southern California,
agreed. His company put about 110 homes on the market in Orange and
Los Angeles counties this month and has sold all but three.</TE>
<TE>   "It's another example that there continues to be a large
undersupply of new housing for the market," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The DataQuick report documented sales that closed in September,
reflecting deals between buyers and home sellers during the last 30
to 60 days.</TE>
<TE>   The median price, the point at which half the homes in a given
market sell for more and the other half for less, is considered more
statistically accurate than the average price.</TE>
<TE>   Signs that in the past have presaged market slowdowns have yet to
emerge, said DataQuick analyst John Karevoll, who compiles the
monthly data.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a sharp increase in the number of people falling behind on
their mortgage payments nationwide, the rate of those entering the
first stage of foreclosure in Orange and Los Angeles counties in
September remained at its lowest level in more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Sellers in distress often have been able to find buyers to relieve
their financial burdens, Karevoll said.</TE>
<TE>   The average size of a down payment held steady at 13.5% in Los
Angeles County and 20% in Orange County.</TE>

<HD>Stocks End 4-Day Rally; Intel, Iraq Drag Markets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street made an expected retreat Wednesday on discouraging
earnings from Intel and profit taking from a four-day rally that had
boosted the Dow Jones industrial average nearly 1,000 points.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow fell almost 220 points, its losses widening after
President Bush signed a congressional resolution that would allow him
to use force if necessary against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The possibility of war further weighed on a market that already
had been expected to pull back after its recent rally. Still, some
analysts are hoping that overall third-quarter earnings will surpass
forecasts, and that could put the market in position to continue its
advance.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow closed down 219.65 points, or 2.7%, at 8,036.03; on
Tuesday, the Dow had soared 378 points, bringing its gain over four
trading sessions to 969 points. The Nasdaq composite index sank 50.02
points, or 3.9%, to 1,232.42. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell
21.25 points, or 2.4%, to 860.02.</TE>
<TE>   Losers swamped winners by 3 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange
and by 3 to 2 on Nasdaq in active trading.</TE>
<TE>   Bond yields continued their recent climb, with the yield on the
benchmark 10-year Treasury note rising from Tuesday's close of 3.99%
to 4.05% -- its first close above 4% in more than a month.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Intel dropped $2.98 to $13.54. The No. 1 chip maker announced
late Tuesday that earnings missed analysts' expectations by 2 cents a
share, setting the stage for Wednesday's sell-off.</TE>
<TE>   * Coca-Cola, another Dow stock, dropped $5.28 to $47.20. The
world's biggest soft-drink company earned 47 cents a share in the
third quarter, below analysts estimates. Full-year profit may miss
analysts' forecasts, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   * Capital One Financial lost $6.79, or 20%, to $27.85. The
fifth-biggest issuer of Visa and MasterCard credit cards said it
expects to write off more loans in the fourth quarter of this year
and first half of next year. Other credit card issuers also slid.
Providian Financial dropped 80 cents, or 18%, to $3.70, and MBNA lost
$1.52 to $18.29.</TE>
<TE>   * Other companies saw their shares fall Wednesday despite posting
positive earnings results. Brokerage firm Merrill Lynch, which beat
estimates by 15 cents a share, slipped 9 cents to $35.90.</TE>
<TE>   * Investors took profits from companies responsible for Tuesday's
rally. General Motors tumbled $2.56 to $34.14, Johnson &amp; Johnson fell
66 cents to $58.90, and Citigroup declined 29 cents to $33.85. All
three beat earnings expectations in reports Tuesday.</TE>

Fictitious receivables are alleged.</DH>

<LD>In the weeks before Peregrine Systems Inc. filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection, the company's executives focused their time
and tens of millions of dollars on deals with banks and lawyers that
were aimed at protecting themselves rather than fixing the San Diego
software firm, according to a recent court filing.</LD>
<LD>   The allegations, filed last week in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Delaware week by a committee of unsecured creditors, provided a new
look at the company's inner workings.</LD>
<LD>   Peregrine, whose chairman is San Diego Padres owner John J.
Moores, is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Justice Department.</LD>
<TE>   "While the company was facing all sorts of business challenges, it
was doing things that may well give rise to civil liability and
conceivably criminal," said Bruce Bennett, chief counsel for the
creditors committee.</TE>
<TE>   Moores did not return calls for comment late Wednesday. But
Richard Pachulski, an attorney representing Peregrine in its
bankruptcy proceedings, said the allegations were without merit.</TE>
<TE>   Peregrine is restating its finances from April 1999 through
December 2001 and says revenue may have been inflated by as much as
$250 million. Its former auditing firm, KPMG, has accused the company
of possible fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The creditors' filing concerns Peregrine's accounts-receivable
practices. According to the filing, Peregrine sometimes sold the same
receivables to two lenders and sometimes sold fictitious receivables.</TE>
<TE>   The creditors also criticized Peregrine's management for spending
$2.9 million on an internal investigation of the accounting
improprieties. The report, led by law firm Latham &amp; Watkins and the
accounting forensic team of PricewaterhouseCoopers, concluded that
the directors were in the dark about the accounting improprieties.</TE>
<TE>   Peregrine submitted the report to the SEC in late August.</TE>
<TE>   Around the same time, the firm finalized retention bonuses and
management incentives for many of its top employees and made plans to
pay $5 million to a small group of key figures.</TE>
<TE>   The bonuses include an undisclosed sum to Rod Dammeyer, the former
head of the board's audit committee, who resigned one day before
auditor KPMG publicly stated that Peregrine's finances were
problematic.</TE>

<HD>Logjam at Ports Continues as Sides Blame Each Other</HD>
<DH>The backup of vessels remains a concern because arrivals of
ships are keeping pace with departures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland and David Streitfeld</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a crush of activity at major West Coast ports from Long Beach
to Seattle, shipping lines said Wednesday that there has been little
progress in breaking the logjam of ships that built up during a
10-day employer lockout.</LD>
<LD>   Shipping companies and unionized dockworkers continued to blame
each other as the number of vessels waiting outside the ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach held steady, at 118 late Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "We had hoped by now that things would start on a downward trend,"
said Capt. Dick McKenna, deputy executive director of the Marine
Exchange, which monitors ship activity at the ports of Los Angeles
and Long Beach. "We're bailing as fast as we can, but the level's not
going down. It is a bit of a concern for us."</LD>
<TE>   In San Francisco, meanwhile, a federal judge officially extended
the injunction that forced ports to reopen Oct. 9 for 80 days under
the rarely used Taft-Hartley Act. U.S. District Judge William Alsup
pointedly noted that the injunction not only prohibits employers from
closing the ports, it also bans workers from staging slowdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents shipping lines and
terminal operators, claims the union has been deliberately slowing
the work pace by failing to dispatch sufficient numbers of skilled
workers to job sites.</TE>
<TE>   But the International Longshore and Warehouse Union claims
shipping companies and terminal operators have been sabotaging
efforts to clear the ports by ordering insufficient labor. They also
said logistical problems, such as a shortage of truck chassis to
carry containers, make the dig-out difficult.</TE>
<TE>   When terminals first reopened, shipping experts estimated it would
take four to eight weeks to get the ports and the transpacific
shipping pipeline back to normal. However, loaded ships are coming in
at the same rate that others are leaving.</TE>
<TE>   "The line of vessels remains about as long now as it was before,"
said PMA spokesman John Pachtner, as he left the hearing in San
Francisco. "We aren't making significant progress in unclogging the
cargo pipeline."</TE>
<TE>   Pachtner hinted that the association may present evidence to the
U.S. attorney that the union is intentionally slowing the pace of
work.</TE>
<TE>   He said that productivity was down from normal levels by 10% to
25%, and that the PMA is looking at payroll records, crane movements
and other data to determine the cause.</TE>
<TE>   But union attorney Richard Zuckerman, at the same hearing, said,
"There is no evidence at this point that there's any noncompliance
[with the injunction]. If they had evidence, they certainly would
have brought it to the court's attention."</TE>

<HD>Rents in Southland Rising at Brisk Pace</HD>
<DH>A housing market with tight supply and high prices pushes
more Southern Californians to shop for rentals.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Apartment rents climbed faster in Southern California during the last
three months than in other areas across the West, an industry
research group said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Average rent in Southern California rose to $1,167 at the end of
September, up 3.2% from June and up 4.6% from a year earlier, said
RealFacts of Novato. In contrast, Northern California's average rent
declined 1.9% to $1,196, down 8.8% from a year earlier, the report
said.</LD>
<LD>   As the housing market steams ahead, shrinking supply and rising
prices push more first-time buyers in Southern California to shop for
rentals. In addition, Southern California is creating jobs at a
faster pace than other areas, according to state figures released
this week.</LD>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the average apartment rent rose 3.3%, the
biggest jump in two years and the largest increase in Southern
California. The rise to an average $1,295 rent at the end of
September marked a 5.8% increase from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica was the priciest of all communities in the West, with
an average rent of $2,487, RealFacts said. In Orange County, the
average apartment rent edged up 1.6% to $1,232, the largest quarterly
increase in more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   Rents will continue to rise in Los Angeles County in the months
ahead, but not at the same pace, said Harvey E. Green, president of
Marcus &amp; Millichap, a real estate brokerage specializing in apartment
sales. "Demand for apartments is still strong," he said. "Supply and
demand have been kept pretty well in balance."</TE>
<TE>   Occupancy rates rose only slightly throughout the region that
stretches to Colorado. Orange County chalked up the biggest increase,
to 95.6% from 94.4% in June. The occupancy rate in Los Angeles County
declined a slight 0.3 percentage point to 95.6%.</TE>
<TE>   In the Inland Empire, where construction of apartments remains
strong, the average rent rose 1.4% to $875; the occupancy rate edged
up to 95.5%. Rents in the region have surged 30% in four years and
are up 4.9% in the last year. In San Bernardino County, the average
rent was $745.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, the average rent fell 1.1% during the quarter
to $1,216.</TE>

a lawsuit accusing U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Co. of illegally
distributing free product samples on public grounds where minors were
present.</LD>
<LD>   The suit said the company, a subsidiary of UST Inc., twice
violated state law in 1999 when it gave out samples at the Placer and
Alameda county fairgrounds. Under state law, tobacco samples may be
distributed only at sites where access by minors is prohibited.</LD>

<LD>Mobile telephone maker Motorola Inc. lowered sales and profit
forecasts through 2003 as demand slumps for cellular-network gear and
chips. The shares plunged.</LD>
<LD>   Motorola expects fourth-quarter net income of 4 cents a share on
$7.1 billion in sales. That would be the lowest fourth-quarter
revenue since 1994.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola fell $2.25 to close at

<LD>Honeywell International Inc. had third-quarter profit of $412 million
because of cost cuts and said it plans to fire as many as 5,000 more
workers as sales to factories and to plane makers drop.</LD>

$308 million, or 38 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Sales
fell to $5.57 billion from $5.79 billion, led by a 7% drop from

<HD>Cadiz Gets Extension on Pressing Debt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Hiltzik</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cadiz Inc., the agricultural company that recently lost a deal with
the Metropolitan Water District to build a major water project in the
Mojave Desert, said it negotiated a three-year extension on a
$35-million bank line that was to fall due on Jan. 31.</LD>
<LD>   Under agreement with ING Baring Bank, Cadiz will issue new
warrants giving the bank the right to acquire up to 10% of the
company for "nominal consideration," although previous company
disclosures said the bank already owned the right to acquire
equivalent ownership for 1 cent a share if the loan were not repaid
by Jan. 30.</LD>
<LD>   The company did not say whether the interest rate on the loan
would change. Cadiz also said it extended the mandatory redemption
date on $12.5 million in convertible preferred stock by two years, to
July 2006, by reducing the conversion rate to $5.25 per common share
from up to $8.</LD>
<TE>   The company did not say whether other terms of the preferred issue
had changed. The extensions give Cadiz some relief from what loomed
as pressing financial contingencies in the wake of the MWD's
cancellation of the water project. On the news, Cadiz shares rose 65
cents to $1 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Panasonic Gets Digital Cable-Ready TV Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Panasonic Technologies has struck a deal with the cable industry that
will enable the company to build cable-ready digital TV sets,
starting as early as next year. The agreement, which gives Panasonic
a license to the industry's security technology, is the first to be
signed by a television manufacturer.</LD>
<LD>   Consumer electronics companies have been pressing federal
regulators to order more lenient licensing terms than originally
proposed, saying that the cable operators were requiring costly extra
features, demanding to approve products before they hit the market,
and threatening consumers' ability to record programs. Paul Liao,
president of Panasonic, gave no details of the agreement, but said,
"Those were all important issues, and we have found a way to address
them ... to the satisfaction of both parties."</LD>
<LD>   Liao said the agreement was "not inconsistent with the major
thrust of the consumer-electronics industry." Negotiators for set
manufacturers and cable operators are continuing to discuss an
industry-wide compromise that could clear the way for more
cable-ready digital TV sets.</LD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moving quickly to implement corporate reforms ordered by Congress,
securities regulators Wednesday proposed forcing companies to
disclose more about their internal controls and codes of ethics.</LD>
<LD>   By unanimous votes, the Securities and Exchange Commission sent
the two proposed rules out for public comment, along with a third
that would require companies to disclose whether their boards' audit
committee has any "financial experts" on it.</LD>
<LD>   A fourth proposed measure also approved 5-0 would make it a crime
to strong-arm or mislead corporate auditors into cooking the
financial books.</LD>
<TE>   SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt said his agency is very close to naming
the five members of a new national board for policing corporate
accountants.</TE>
<TE>   "We will meet the Oct. 28 deadline," Pitt said, referring to the
date by which the board must be named under orders from Congress
contained in the landmark Sarbanes-Oxley Act.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC has a huge task in implementing Sarbanes-Oxley, passed in
July as the biggest U.S. securities law overhaul since the 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   The four measures sent out for comment were expected to be
finalized by early next year.</TE>

<HD>No Signs of Recovery in Tech Earnings</HD>
<DH>Apple posts a loss of $45 million, AMD's loss widens to
$254 million, and IBM's profit falls 18%. Continued sluggishness is
predicted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph Menn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Glum quarterly results Wednesday from three computer industry
mainstays -- IBM Corp., Apple Computer Corp. and Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. -- reinforced the grim outlook offered a day earlier by
top chip maker Intel Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Apple and AMD, the No. 2 chip company, both posted losses for the
latest three-month period, and profit at IBM fell 18%. None forecast
an imminent rebound in consumer or corporate spending on technology
products.</LD>
<LD>   "We do not expect our industry to pick up any time soon," said
Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs, whose company sometimes manages to
buck industry trends with a niche appeal.</LD>
<TE>   Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple said it lost $45 million in its
fiscal fourth quarter, or 13 cents a share, as soured investments and
a 14% decline in shipments of its flagship Macintosh computers
reversed a year-earlier profit of $66 million, or 19 cents. Revenue
was unchanged at $1.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Apple said it would have earned $7 million, or 2 cents a share,
without the investment impairments and other one-time events,
matching Wall Street expectations. But the stock dipped to as low as
$13.38 after hours from a close of $14.56 in regular Nasdaq trading
as Apple Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson predicted only a
"slight profit" before more nonrecurring items in the next quarter.</TE>
<TE>   For the full fiscal year, Apple earned $65 million on sales of
$5.74 billion, contrasted with a loss of $25 million on sales of
$5.36 billion in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD's third-quarter loss widened to $254
million, or 74 cents a share, from $187 million, or 54 cents. Sales
crumbled by a third to $508.2 million. Analysts had expected a loss
of 67 cents. AMD stock fell 71 cents to $3.49 on the New York Stock
Exchange ahead of the earnings results, then gained back 50 cents in
after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   "We are accelerating our strategy to reset our business model and
lower our corporate break-even point," said Chief Financial Officer
Robert Rivet. "We will begin to implement additional and aggressive
actions in the fourth quarter."</TE>
<TE>   IBM likewise said it expected to benefit more from cost cutting
than from revenue increases. Chief Financial Officer John Joyce said
$900 million in savings next year would more than offset a projected
$700-million hit from IBM reducing its estimated returns from
investing its pension fund assets.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to push productivity, with continued focus on
costs and expense," Joyce told investors and analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Based in Armonk, N.Y., IBM is the world's largest computer and
technology services firm. The company said it would continue to
emphasize services and software instead of computer systems, a market
in which profit is harder to come by.</TE>
<TE>   In the third quarter, IBM profit fell as losses widened on
businesses that IBM is abandoning, including a hard disk drive unit
being sold to Hitachi Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   IBM earnings dropped to $1.3 billion, or 76 cents a share, from
$1.6 billion, or 90 cents, a year earlier. Sales continued to
stagnate, edging up 0.2% to $19.82 billion from $19.78 billion.</TE>
<TE>   On continuing operations, which are tracked more closely by
analysts, IBM earned $1.69 billion, down slightly from $1.71 billion.
Because IBM bought back 56 million of its shares during the year, the
profit per share from continuing operations improved to 99 cents from
97 cents.</TE>
<TE>   On that basis, IBM topped the average Wall Street expectation of
96 cents, according to Thomson First Call. IBM shares fell $3.58 to
$64.90 in regular NYSE trading, then reversed course and rose $4.81.</TE>
<TE>   Sales for IBM's hardware and software businesses fell by 1% and
3%, respectively, less sharply than in recent quarters. Services,
IBM's most profitable division, gained 2% to $8.9 billion in sales.</TE>
<TE>   Joyce said he was comfortable with analysts' sales and profit
projections for the fourth quarter and that the just-completed
acquisition of consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers should add $1
billion to that quarter's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he couldn't pinpoint when information technology
spending will resume its growth, adding, "I wish I could."</TE>

<HD>HCA to Acquire Health Midwest</HD>
<DH>The chain's $1.13-billion bid for the struggling
14-hospital network beats an offer from Tenet Healthcare.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Lee</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a setback for Tenet Healthcare Corp., rival hospital giant HCA
Inc. said Wednesday that it has agreed to buy Health Midwest, a
14-hospital chain based in Kansas City, Mo., for $1.13 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Barbara-based Tenet and HCA were the two finalists in a rare
opportunity to acquire, in one swoop, a dominant hospital system in a
growing urban market. The 20-member board of Health Midwest, a
nonprofit company that has been struggling financially, said it voted
unanimously to go with HCA.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to the cash price, HCA said it would spend $450
million for capital improvements over the next five years. The deal,
which is contingent on reaching a final agreement and regulatory
approvals, would be the largest acquisition for HCA since the
Nashville-based company merged with Columbia in 1994. HCA is the
nation's biggest hospital chain with 181.</LD>
<TE>   Tenet, the No. 2 chain with 114 hospitals, including 40 in
California, downplayed the significance of its failed bid for Health
Midwest. Although acknowledging that Health Midwest was a "terrific
opportunity," spokesman Harry Anderson said it was not essential to
Tenet or factored into the company's previously stated projections of
at least 25% earnings growth in its current fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   "HCA's bid was much higher," Anderson said, noting that he could
not disclose Tenet's offer because of a confidentiality agreement.
"We're not willing to make an acquisition just for the sake of
growth."</TE>
<TE>   This summer, Tenet lost a bid to take control of Baptist Health
System, a five-hospital system based in San Antonio. Tenet is in
talks to buy a hospital in Philadelphia, one in Louisiana and the
USC/Norris Cancer Hospital in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet and HCA operate largely in urban markets and share a common
strategy of trying to buy hospitals in areas where they can be a
dominant player, which gives them leverage in negotiating contracts
with health insurance companies.</TE>
<TE>   Health Midwest spokesman Chris Whitley said price was not the only
factor in the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "As important to the board was to find a party that would offer a
strong commitment to maintain and honor the various religious,
cultural and charitable traditions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Labor and community activists in Kansas City have opposed a
takeover of a nonprofit health system by an investor-owned
corporation, raising concerns that such a conversion would lead to
cuts, hurting employees and consumers.</TE>
<TE>   HCA shares rose 28 cents Wednesday to $51.18. Tenet closed at
$50.56, up 16 cents. Both are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Rebuilding Iraq: Japan Is No Model</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chalmers Johnson</AU>
<BD>Chalmers Johnson is president of the Japan Policy
Research Institute. His latest book is "Blowback: The Costs and
Consequences of American Empire" (Owl Books, 2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>According to press reports, the White House is developing a plan,
modeled on the postwar occupation of Japan, to install an
American-led military government in Iraq. Administration officials
said Iraq would be governed by a senior American military officer,
who would assume the role that Gen. Douglas MacArthur played in Japan
after its surrender. The plan calls for war-crimes trials of Iraqi
leaders and a transition to an elected civilian government after a
few years of American occupation.</LD>
<LD>   After the story broke last week, the White House tried to back
away from it. However, some unnamed senior officials have stood by
it.</LD>
<LD>   Our politics become more surreal every day. This plan won't work
for the simple reason that Iraq is not Japan. The Bush White House
and the Rumsfeld Pentagon seem to know next to nothing about Japan.</LD>
<TE>   The Potsdam Declaration ending World War II ordered MacArthur to
"democratize" Japan. MacArthur himself thought that this order held
great dangers. If not done carefully, his efforts would have only the
legitimacy of the conqueror behind them and might well provide a
target for later Japanese nationalists seeking to overturn foreign
reforms.</TE>
<TE>   MacArthur made some strategic decisions. He retained Hirohito on
the throne and had all occupation reform directives come from the
emperor. The general conducted an indirect occupation. He did not
replace the wartime Japanese government but kept it intact, only now
taking orders from him.</TE>
<TE>   The new Japanese constitution, land reform, trade unions and the
attempt to open up the economy all came in the form of laws enacted
by the Japanese government. If the U.S. intends to follow the
Japanese model in Iraq, it will have to keep Saddam Hussein in place
and work through him.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of conducting war-crimes trials is crackpot. In Japan,
they were intended to educate the public about the war, but they
backfired. Gen. Hideki Tojo, who was prime minister at the time of
Pearl Harbor, embarrassed everyone by asking from the dock, "Why
isn't the emperor here?" No one dared answer that MacArthur had
rewritten history to keep the emperor in power. By the time the U.S.
got around to hanging a few wartime leaders, most Japanese saw the
war-crimes trials as miscarriages of justice.</TE>
<TE>   Most Americans do not understand that the Japanese people do not
credit MacArthur with bringing democracy to Japan, although they do
honor his memory as a postwar shogun. Democracy already existed in
Japan, based on the parliamentary politics of the 1920s, before the
militarists took over.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason the Japanese don't credit the U.S. is that halfway
through the occupation the Americans changed their minds and began
turning Japan into a docile American satellite for fighting the Cold
War.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called "reverse course" of 1947 meant welcoming back to
power many of the prewar and wartime leaders whom the Americans had
purged. Seeing this, the Japanese worked to take advantage of the new
conditions created by the Cold War. In return for letting the U.S.
keep its military bases on Japanese soil, the Japanese demanded
unrestricted access to the U.S. market and American tolerance of
their protectionism. The results of this policy can be seen today in
any U.S. parking lot. It also produced the largest trade imbalances
(in favor of Japan) in economic history.</TE>
<TE>   During the early days of the Allied occupation, the Americans did
not have any economic interests in Japan. But the oil lobby led by
Vice President Dick Cheney is drooling to get its hands on Iraq's
oil. As late as 1999, Cheney's former company, Halliburton, supplied
Hussein with $23.8 million worth of oil field equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most obviously, MacArthur did not have a serious religion
problem in Japan. He forced the emperor to renounce his status as a
Shinto god, but religious impulses have always lain lightly on the
Japanese psyche. Iraq, by contrast, is ruled by a minority government
of Sunni Muslims that has fought bloody wars with the country's
Shiite and Kurdish majorities.</TE>
<TE>   I am doubtful that a group of heavily armed American infidels can
bring "democracy" to Iraq, but I know for certain that what happened
50 years ago in Japan is no model.</TE>

<HD>Sharon's Balancing Act</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Yossi Klein Halevi</AU>
<BD>Yossi Klein Halevi is the Israel correspondent for the
New Republic and a senior writer for the Jerusalem Report. He is
author of "At the Entrance to the Garden of Eden: A Jew's Search for
Hope With Christians and Muslims in the Holy Land" (HarperCollins,
2001).</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's endorsement of Ariel Sharon's right to
retaliate against a possible Iraqi missile attack on Israeli cities
is a necessary recognition of the political reality of the Middle
East, where restraint is often mistaken for weakness.</LD>
<LD>   During the Gulf War in 1991, 39 Scud missiles fell on Tel Aviv and
Haifa. Back then, Israel accepted Washington's call for restraint to
avoid disrupting the Arab anti-Saddam Hussein coalition. Low Israeli
casualties also helped ease domestic pressure for retaliation.</LD>
<LD>   This time, though, there is no Arab anti-Hussein coalition to
appease. And if Hussein attacks Israel with chemical or biological
weapons, the casualty figures will look very different from 1991.</LD>
<TE>   Many here are convinced that Israel's restraint during the Gulf
War undermined its deterrence and emboldened subsequent Arab attacks,
culminating in the current Palestinian terrorist war.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last decade, the perception has grown in the Arab world
that Israel has become a society of lazy and fearful consumerists who
lack the will to defend themselves. Reversing that perception is a
key goal of Israel's war against terrorism. A second Israeli failure
to respond to Iraqi missiles would be perceived in the Arab world as
weakness and invite aggression.</TE>
<TE>   Although President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon agree on Iraq,
Washington is urging Israel to ease up in its war against Palestinian
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   However, Sharon will find it hard to persuade the Israeli army of
the wisdom of Washington's demand.</TE>
<TE>   The generals are understandably concerned that the Israeli
military's impressive success in reducing the number of suicide
bombings will be compromised by U.S.-imposed restraint.</TE>
<TE>   The army is now occupying the major West Bank cities, and most
Israelis want to see the soldiers stay there until the Palestinian
Authority accepts responsibility for controlling suicide bombers.
Washington, though, is eager to calm the Palestinian front as it
prepares for war against Iraq, and it is pressing Israel to begin
withdrawal -- a move that would almost certainly result in more
atrocities in Israeli cities.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to the predictions of Israel's critics, Sharon's war
against Yasser Arafat's terrorist regime hasn't hardened Palestinian
resolve but rather has produced the opposite result.</TE>
<TE>   Since Israel began its massive crackdown last spring, several key
Palestinian leaders, including possible Arafat heir Mahmoud Abbas,
better known as Abu Mazen, have begun to publicly concede that the
chairman's terrorist strategy has backfired and are now urging a
cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   One former Palestinian Cabinet minister, Nabil Amr, went so far as
to publish an open letter to Arafat in the Palestinian press deriding
him for rejecting Israel's offer of Palestinian statehood at Camp
David in July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Emboldening Palestinian moderates is another key goal of Israel's
military assault. But that trend could be jeopardized if Israeli
pressure on the Palestinian terror apparatus is forced to ease.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Sharon doesn't want to complicate the American war effort,
and he sees Hussein's removal from power as a prerequisite for
freeing the Middle East from its pathological culture of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   That's why, in recent weeks, he has ordered the army not to
retaliate against repeated shelling of the Galilee by the Lebanese
fundamentalist group Hezbollah.</TE>
<TE>   Nor has he responded to the Lebanese government's provocative act
of diverting a key source of the Jordan River, potentially
threatening 15% of Israel's water reserves.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his image abroad as an unreconstructed warrior, Sharon is
resented by some on the Israeli right for preferring national unity
with the moderate Labor Party over a narrow, hard-line coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Many within his own Likud Party haven't forgiven him for promising
the Americans that he would not expel Arafat from the territories.
One right-wing politician sarcastically suggested that Sharon retire
to an old-age home.</TE>
<TE>   The coming weeks will be among the most trying ever faced by an
Israeli prime minister. Sharon now must balance the conflicting needs
of respecting American interests while protecting Israeli citizens
and the nation's deterrence capability.</TE>
<TE>   The understanding that Bush has shown for Sharon's dilemma will
help the Israeli leader assume the role of responsible ally and
resist domestic pressures to intensify Israeli retaliation against
Arab provocations.</TE>

<HD>Sniper or Hussein, Terrorism Is the Same</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Norah Vincent</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a writer and a senior fellow at the
Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after
Sept. 11 to study terrorism. Web site: www.norah vincent.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Until a sniper started felling people at random around the nation's
capital, many people thought that the Bush administration's strongest
argument for war in Iraq was as farfetched and paranoid a proposition
as President Reagan's "Star Wars." As amazing as this may seem after
the catastrophic events of Sept. 11, some people still balk at the
suggestion that our nation could be held hostage by an impresario of
terror who, when he consolidates his weapons of mass destruction,
will use them against us indirectly by furnishing them to Al Qaeda.</LD>
<LD>   We've gone complacent again, slipping back into blinkered denial
about how real the terror threat is, especially from our old foe
Saddam Hussein. According to a Fox News poll, "the level of public
support for removing Saddam is at 66%, down from 72% two months ago
and from a high of 77% in November 2001."</LD>
<LD>   Even Congress has equivocated on the issue. Just weeks ago, the
Republican Party was split on Iraq, and leading Democrats were
flaunting a dedicated opposition. Then suddenly last week, with their
eyes on the prize in November (Democrats don't want to be seen as
soft on terror, and Republicans want to present a unified front),
both houses of Congress came through unexpectedly with a cynical vote
to approve the use of force in Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   Now maybe the Beltway sharpshooter is starting to make us all a
little more sensitized to the realities of living like Israelis, with
terror following us to the mall, school and gas station. Perhaps the
cross hairs burning holes in the back of our heads are bringing to
mind the unpleasant truth about Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Some venturesome profilers and pundits are starting to make a
link, suggesting that the sniper might in fact be a terrorist and not
just a psycho on the loose. But most are still failing to draw the
obvious parallel. Even if the sniper is not a terrorist, he is acting
like one. He is giving us a strong taste of what such terrorism would
be like, and how easy it would be to carry out. The panic is already
widespread, and this is only one man (possibly with an accomplice)
firing a single rifle shot at a time. Imagine what it would be like
if the next roving killer carried smallpox, anthrax or a nuclear
device in a suitcase.</TE>
<TE>   Both in method and in posture, this sniper is Hussein in
microcosm. In method, because he strikes without warning, just as
Hussein did against the Kurds and the Kuwaitis and will do again if
he obtains weapons of mass destruction. This, after all, is rule No.
1 in the terrorist's handbook: Strike without warning in places that
no one suspects, like a nightclub in Bali.</TE>
<TE>   In posture, because he is anonymous in supporting terrorism, and
anonymity allows him not only to go on purveying his devilry at
leisure but also to escape punishment for it. Arguably, this is what
Hussein has done already. He has provided refuge to fleeing Al Qaeda
operatives, funneled money to Palestinian suicide bombers and quite
possibly had a hand in bankrolling or otherwise abetting the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Gulf War, covert operations like these have allowed him
to strike at the U.S. and its interests abroad with impunity. Until
now, that is.</TE>
<TE>   Horrific as it was, Sept. 11 induced us to learn from adversity
and to be vigilant. And grisly as he may be, the sniper can teach us
the same lesson about Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   If we fail to learn it, we are likely to find ourselves again in
the position of wishing we had responded to what, in hindsight, will
seem like an obvious harbinger of catastrophe.</TE>

<HD>It Takes a Village to Create a Secession</HD>
<DH>Cityhood decision rests on people's feelings about their
community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert White</AU>
<BD>Robert White, a television writer whose programs
included "My Favorite Martian," is co-author of "Hollywood &amp; the Best
of Los Angeles Alive!" released in July by Hunter Publishing.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can often find "Dr. John" outside the Venice post office. It's
hard to miss the tall, lean man with bright blue eyes behind
wire-rimmed glasses, white beard and startling red beret.</LD>
<LD>   Prominent also is his "Cityhood for Venice!" petition awaiting
signers.</LD>
<LD>   Venice was an independent city until it was annexed to Los Angeles
in 1925. A movement to secede started that same year and has been
pursued off and on ever since.</LD>
<TE>   My late wife, Phyllis, and I wrote a book about Los Angeles'
century-long affair with the movies. The chapters trace geographic
entities: Hollywood, West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Culver City.</TE>
<TE>   While doing research, chatting with people about their
communities, we found that the bond between the citizen and his or
her immediate area was strong when the boundaries were sharp and
easily defined -- take, for instance, Santa Monica -- and weak to
nonexistent when boundaries were vague and had no historical reality;
regard West Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The San Fernando Valley has both a strong history as a place and
definite boundaries. This is where William Mulholland brought water
from the Owens Valley in 1913, which quickly changed the Valley from
a semidesert to a bountiful agricultural area. And after World War
II, all the groves were just as abruptly replaced by vast tracts of
veterans' housing.</TE>
<TE>   As to the boundaries, just look around at the mountains on every
side.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's borders, on the other hand, are not definite at all.
Everyone has a different perception; the secessionists' map is a
compromise.</TE>
<TE>   However, the idea of Hollywood as a place is so embedded in
everyone's consciousness that the little portion that is trying to
secede -- with its population of 180,000 -- is better known around
the world than is big Los Angeles, with its population of 3.7
million.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly, lines drawn on maps are hardly mentioned in the arguments
over secession.</TE>
<TE>   The civic separatists always say that smaller cities put citizens
closer to their leaders and deliver better, more efficient services.</TE>
<TE>   They add that those people living below the poverty line are
becoming worse off in Los Angeles and would do better in a smaller
city.</TE>
<TE>   Those against carving painful pieces out of our Southland
megalopolis cite the pride of being part of a city large enough to
wield clout in Washington and say that rent control, a living-wage
ordinance and equal benefits for domestic partners may be lost and
that those living under the poverty line would be worse off.</TE>
<TE>   Few people mention a feeling that could trump all the arguments
about economics: How strong is the bond between the voter and his
neighborhood or village or city?</TE>
<TE>   Despite the polls, no one really knows whether those in the Valley
and Hollywood will be better off or less well off if they break away.
But there is a potential poll that would give a strong indication.
Simply ask those who live in the other 87 cities in Los Angeles
County how they are doing.</TE>
<TE>   Inquire of residents of Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, Burbank,
Glendale, Pasadena: Would you vote to abolish your city and become
part of Los Angeles?</TE>
<TE>   If you find anyone who answers with a "yes," let me know.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Dr. John's petition has 4,000 signatures; 1,000 more
are needed to put cityhood for Venice on a ballot.</TE>
<TE>   I have a feeling we're going to go through this again.</TE>

<HD>Stick to Your Facts, CIA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Central Intelligence Agency needs to provide decision-makers with
the best facts and analysis possible, free of political interference.
As the Bush administration prepares for possible war with Iraq, some
analysts and members of Congress complain that intelligence officials
are being pressured to supply facts that fit decisions already made,
not the other way around.</LD>
<LD>   George J. Tenet, CIA director in the Clinton and Bush
administrations, denies that there has been any undue influence
exerted on his agency. But intelligence and congressional sources
told Times reporters Greg Miller and Bob Drogin last week that senior
Bush administration officials were pressuring CIA analysts to come up
with information that would make it easier for Washington to build a
case against Saddam Hussein. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was
named as an offender; a Pentagon official rejected the charges,
saying Rumsfeld merely challenges assumptions and asks tough
questions to ensure that briefers can substantiate their analyses.</LD>
<LD>   Getting the facts is not easy, especially concerning a country
like Iraq. The CIA has a dismal record in the Persian Gulf over past
decades, having overstated the opposition in Iran to the clerics who
toppled the shah and then underestimating Iraq's threat to neighbors
such as Kuwait.</LD>
<TE>   When the Reagan administration contended that the CIA under
President Carter underestimated the threat from the Soviet Union in
the late 1970s, a special panel came up with a more alarmist view of
the data. But after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the CIA was
found to have overestimated Moscow's military threat. It's bad enough
when cooked books lead to excessive spending to counter an enemy less
powerful than supposed; it's worse if lives are lost in unnecessary
battles.</TE>
<TE>   The extent of Baghdad's contacts with Al Qaeda is in dispute, as
is the severity of Iraq's threat to other nations and the size of its
arsenals of chemical and biological weapons. Evidence of its nuclear
capabilities is ambiguous. Certainty is elusive, but the CIA must
present analyses and interpretations based on all the facts gathered,
not politically driven and preconceived conclusions.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hamilton High School's main building, with its ornate brickwork and
cupola from the 1930s, has starred in countless television dramas.
But inside the school, students have to dodge a trash barrel
stationed smack in the center of the main hall to catch drips from
the school's air-conditioning pipes. Masking tape holds ceiling tiles
in place. And with enrollment topping 3,000, portable classrooms have
gobbled up space on the edges of Hamilton's quadrangle, making this
Pico-Robertson campus seem that much more crowded.</LD>
<LD>   Measure K wouldn't airbrush away all of Hamilton's many
infrastructure problems, but it would help a lot. The $3.35-billion
bond would allow the Los Angeles Unified School District to build 120
new schools and undertake major upgrades and additions at 79 existing
schools, such as a new classroom building for Hamilton.</LD>
<LD>   The Times endorses Measure K because as enrollment continues to
grow, a chair for every student will soon be hard to come by unless
the district continues to build.</LD>
<TE>   Districtwide, 15,200 students already ride a bus out of their
neighborhoods to less crowded schools. Some travel to Gledhill
Elementary School in North Hills, which has added 14 portable
classrooms in just five years.</TE>
<TE>   To Gledhill, Measure K would mean a new two-story classroom
building, replacing some bungalows. It would also mean a coat of
asphalt on a playground so riddled with cracks that teachers on
recess duty bandage even more skinned knees than usual.</TE>
<TE>   The real question is not whether local children need the new
classrooms, repaved yards and science labs that Measure K would fund
-- they absolutely do -- but whether the LAUSD can manage the money
after badly bungling Proposition BB, the $2.4-billion bond that
voters approved in 1997. Half of the projects promised in that bond
are now completed and hundreds of schools, including Gledhill, got
air conditioning, termite repairs and new paint, but the district
also wasted millions.</TE>
<TE>   The Belmont Learning Complex fiasco -- the district stopped
construction of this school in 1999 because of safety concerns after
sinking in about $150 million -- finally shamed officials into hiring
the professional construction managers it should have had all along.
That team is now in place and on top of the 80 new schools being
erected, the last BB projects. Five of these schools have already
opened, and the rest are largely on track. Measure K would build on
these successes.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition BB was never intended to pay for all the fixes that
Los Angeles schools so badly need. Measure K wouldn't either, and it
may be a hard sell to property owners who will be on the hook for up
to $5 a month per $100,000 assessed valuation.</TE>
<TE>   But most Los Angeles children still attend crumbling and
overcrowded schools. Voters began a long-overdue modernization drive
by passing Proposition BB. District officials have demonstrated they
have learned a lot since then. Voters should stay the course by
saying yes to Measure K.</TE>

<LD>Proposition 49 is loaded with as many illusions as the movie
blockbusters starring its famous sponsor, Arnold Schwarzenegger. But
its potential to hurt essential services and create budget fiascos is
much less entertaining.</LD>
<LD>   The actor / bodybuilder / political hopeful would like voters to
believe that they can nearly quintuple spending on after-school child
care without raising taxes or cutting into other programs. New state
revenue would pay the $550-million-a-year tab, Schwarzenegger says.</LD>
<LD>   No one would argue with the desirability of safe, high-quality
child care. Its cost to the state is another matter. All school
districts could apply for funding. Each school would get $5 a child
per day but would have to match that with $2.50 a day from private or
district sources. State funding would be capped at $50,000 per
elementary school or $75,000 per middle school, with some additional
grants available for large schools and before-school child care.</LD>
<TE>   So far, so good. But Proposition 49 would lock in yearly funding
for its programs from the state general fund, almost regardless of
the economy, the budget situation or other pressing needs. Despite
Schwarzenegger's assurances that other state programs would not be
harmed, Proposition 49 funding could be cut only in times so bad that
guaranteed core public education funding also would be suspended --
which has never happened, even with this year's dismal budget. And
even in a year that bad, Proposition 49 funding could be cut only by
the same percentage as overall public education -- not slashed more
deeply to preserve public education.</TE>
<TE>   Children do need after-school programs, but they also must have
classrooms, food, medical care and safe streets. This strong-arm
measure would put one benefit ahead of all others in perpetuity.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 49 also would fall far short of its own promises.
Supporters say it would reduce juvenile crime. Yet the act does not
help high schools, whose students are the most likely to get into
after-school trouble.</TE>
<TE>   The matching-fund requirement is a disadvantage to large, urban
districts like Los Angeles Unified, where the need is greatest.
Wealthy districts with private fund-raising arms would find it easier
to go after the state pot.</TE>
<TE>   Schools also could contract with off-campus organizations to
provide the after-school programs. This could mean pumping millions
of public dollars into the YMCA, the Boys &amp; Girls Club and other
private groups to do what they're already doing.</TE>
<TE>   In an unusual development, at least two legislators, one of them
Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), recently
withdrew their endorsements, saying that the bruising budget battle
this year made them realize the damage Proposition 49 could do to the
state. Other legislative endorsers say they are giving the measure a
more careful look. Good idea.</TE>
<TE>   Nice goal, lousy plan. Send it back to the script doctors; vote no
on Proposition 49.</TE>

<HD>Play in the World Series and They Will Come</HD>
<DH>The Angels' trip to the Fall Classic attracts fair-weather
celebrity fans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Brownfield</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one has ever suggested that the Big A stands for A-list, in any
Hollywood sense of the word.</LD>
<LD>   In a sports market where celebrities and athletes commingle in
open mutual admiration, the Anaheim Angels have been worlds away from
L.A.'s big name scene. Think Nicholson with his sunglasses and
Cheshire cat grin, courtside at the Lakers. Rickles and Sinatra at
the Lasorda-era Dodger games.</LD>
<LD>   Now, though, as the Angels head to the World Series, a host of
celebrities are popping up in the stands (or suites) of Edison
International Field. Yes, think Costner, Travolta, Hasselhoff.</LD>
<TE>   Suddenly, there was Disney Chairman Michael Eisner hosting John
Travolta in his corporate box over the weekend, in a magic kingdom of
a ballpark lately dotted with celebrity eyewitnesses, including Reese
Witherspoon (star of the hit Disney movie "Sweet Home Alabama"),
Kevin Costner, Pierce Brosnan, David Hasselhoff, John Ritter, Rob
Reiner and Dennis Quaid.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, which is carrying the games, probably will use the series as
an opportunity to showcase stars of Fox network shows, in effect
product-placing its actors in the stands. Owned by Rupert Murdoch's
News Corp., Fox's assets reach into various media, from movies to TV
to sports. Thus, in the game-within-the-game, News Corp., which is
televising the World Series, will use a Disney product (the Angels)
to promote its own, ancillary product, Fox shows.</TE>
<TE>   The hubbub draws a shrug from one of the team's few Hollywood
stalwarts. David Lander is a former member of the 1960s sketch comedy
troupe the Credibility Gap who is better-known for his years as
Squiggy on the ABC sitcom "Laverne &amp; Shirley." He saw his first
Angels game in 1967, and remembers a 1969 game against the Washington
Senators when the start of play was held up so a helicopter carrying
then-President Richard Nixon could land in center field.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fad. It's like anything," Lander said. "It's not just
here. When the Mets won [the World Series] in '69, Jacqueline Kennedy
was at a game."</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend, as the Angels closed in on their first pennant,
Hollywood glanced up at the winner down the road.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody called Friday and said, 'I have Jack Nicholson's
tickets; you want them?' " said Marty Adelstein, a show business
manager and partner at a new firm called Original, which also handles
film and television production.</TE>
<TE>   Adelstein, a sports fan with season tickets to the Lakers and
Dodgers, went to the Angels-Twins games Friday and Saturday, sitting
behind the first base dugout. He said he knew he was in Orange County
as he listened to the people behind him discuss whether Republican
Bill Simon Jr. has a chance to become governor.</TE>
<TE>   More celebrities are expected when the World Series begins
Saturday, including comedian Ray Romano, tennis star Pete Sampras,
Costner and Reiner, said Tim Mead, the Angels vice president of
communications.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' newfound cachet comes as Disney, which bought the
then-California Angels from founding owner Gene Autry in 1996,
appears to have given up on the Angels as a viable piece of its vast
media empire. The company is openly trying to sell the team amid
projected losses this season of several million dollars.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear who will be on Eisner's World Series guest list; a
representative would only refer questions to the Angels' Mead.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the year that we hope to build some of that [Hollywood]
support," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had folks out here in the past," he added. "Charlie Sheen
bought a section in the outfield, an enclosed section in the old Big
A. Arsenio Hall's been a regular the last couple of years."</TE>
<TE>   To ensure a respectable star quotient for its marquee events,
Major League Baseball sets aside 10 or 20 celebrity tickets, divvied
out on a "case-by-case basis," said Patrick Courtney, a league
spokesman. In 1998, for instance, when the Yankees and San Diego
Padres met in the World Series, Warner Bros. received a call from the
league office asking if any stars of their TV shows wanted to head
south for a game. They landed Anthony Edwards, the-then star of "ER,"
and Judd Nelson of the sitcom "Suddenly Susan."</TE>
<TE>   Without prompting, the New York Yankees have better star-drawing
power than the Angels. Both during the regular season and in their
divisional playoff series with the Angels, the Yankees have brought
out the likes of Adam Sandler, Nicholson and Billy Crystal.</TE>
<TE>   But the notion that the Angels have the ability to attract stars
on their own is a new phenomenon that will be put to a truer test
next season.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, for most of their history, have lost many more games
than they've won. That, and you have to take two or three freeways
from the Westside to reach Edison Field, a schlep even if you're
being driven in a Town Car.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's love affair with Los Angeles sports teams isn't any
more or less fickle than the average fan's. Win and they will show
up. Lose and they won't. When hockey great Wayne Gretzky arrived to
play for the Kings and turned them into a winner, Sylvester Stallone
and Goldie Hawn were suddenly these tanned, incongruous images behind
the rinkside glass.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA's Lakers have symbolized how glitzy a Hollywood embrace
can be since Magic Johnson arrived in 1980 and ushered in the
Showtime era, and with it courtside stars from Dyan Cannon to Jack
Nicholson (although, in fairness to Nicholson, he was a Laker devotee
long before then).</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, too, have a long history of celebrity fans -- many of
them a reflection of former manager-impresario Tom Lasorda, whose
relationship with Frank Sinatra and Don Rickles brought an older
generation of stars out to the ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   The entertainment world, from talent agencies to movie studios to
the stars themselves, spend hundreds of thousands of dollars yearly
to secure luxury suites and prime seats at Dodger Stadium and Staples
Center. But none of the suite-holders at Edison Field are from the
Hollywood entertainment community, Mead said.</TE>
<TE>   "People that are Angel fans are long-suffering," publicist Stan
Rosenfield said. Rosenfield proceeded to tick off his A-list clients
and the team allegiances that precluded Angel fandom. "Hank Azaria is
a Mets fan. Will Smith is a Phillies fan. John Goodman is a Cardinals
fan. George Clooney is a Cincinnati Reds fan. [Robert] De Niro's
probably a Yankee fan. Kelsey [Grammer], I don't think I've ever had
a baseball discussion with him. These people, they don't change
allegiances."</TE>
<TE>   Autry, the Singing Cowboy, wasn't exactly a celebrity magnet for
his ballclub. His regular guests included fellow singing cowboy Monte
Hale, honorary Hollywood Mayor Johnny Grant and the late Pat Buttram,
Autry's movie sidekick who later played Mr. Haney on "Green Acres."</TE>
<TE>   Nixon was in the clubhouse when the Angels clinched their first
division title in 1979, Mead said.</TE>
<TE>   But, added Mead, "Mr. Autry was never caught up" in turning the
Angels into Hollywood's adopted team -- a feat that would have been
nearly impossible anyway, given the Dodgers' hold on L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "My history with the Angels goes back to the 'Knight Rider' days,"
said Hasselhoff, referring to the 1980s show in which he co-starred
with a car, and the 1980s Angel teams that co-starred Reggie Jackson
and Rod Carew.</TE>
<TE>   Hasselhoff, who went on to even more fame on "Baywatch," credits
his wife with turning him on to what the Angels were accomplishing
this season. He promptly finagled playoff tickets (how he got them is
"for me to know and you to find out"), and he has been to every
postseason game at Edison Field. He sits, he said, in the Diamond
Club behind home plate. ("They have a great veal chop").</TE>

their history ends in a bad thing, a broken heart," said Lander, who
should know. "Almost the way the English talk about World War II --

<HD>Australia's Innocence Lost in Rubble of Blast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bernard Lagan</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SYDNEY, Australia -- Australians call this continent the Wide Brown
Land and have long been nursed and cursed by its desert emptiness and
the vast oceans that ring it off from the world. Cursed isolation can
mean economic and cultural hardship, nursed because the world's big
troubles seemed so far off.</LD>
<LD>   Until a car bomb ended that innocence along with the lives of
nearly 200 people.</LD>
<LD>   "This has touched our country in a way that nothing else has,"
Prime Minister John Howard told a shocked nation. "The 11th of
September was bad, there were Australians killed there, but this has
come to our very shores almost, and the people whose lives have been
taken are in the main young Australians with so much ahead of them.
That is what is so terribly sad."</LD>
<TE>   In Australia's official political and defense circles the polite
phrase "the threat from the north" always means Indonesia. Publicly,
Australia continues to be greatly supportive of a closer relationship
with Indonesia, but the measure of its unease is seen in the new
military air bases built across the remote north, the large army
forces there, and the new railroad to provide rapid transport to the
northern seaboard in any conflict.</TE>
<TE>   It is starkly apparent to most Australians that their safety is
now tightly bound to security in Indonesia; that if terrorism gains a
toehold in Indonesia, then Australia's part of the world will never
be the same. Howard even warned that the unthinkable was possible:
terrorists striking on Australian soil. He ordered a review of the
nation's anti-terrorism capabilities and said he would fly to Bali to
assess the situation and attend a memorial service.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said today that Australian
citizens should leave Indonesia because of "disturbing new
information of generic threats to Australians."</TE>
<TE>   He gave no details.</TE>
<TE>   The 5 1/2-hour flight from Australia's populous eastern seaboard,
northwest across the outback, to the Indonesian island of Bali, has
long been a rite of passage -- the resort a place for the young to
party, to taste a foreign culture, to see an island of gentle people,
Hindu temples, monkeys and jungles. All with the reassurance that
comes from large numbers of compatriots and plenty of Australian beer
and television.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever planted the bombs that ripped apart the entertainment
district of the Balinese town of Kuta on Saturday night must have
known that scores of vacationing Australians would be killed and
injured. Sunday will be a day of national mourning.</TE>
<TE>   Australia has never lacked for leaders fond of sending its young
men off to other people's wars in faraway places. And every year,
young Australians flock to the Gallipoli Peninsula in Turkey, where
thousands of Australians died in World War I. This week, as the
nation has watched footage of bloodied young men and women being
airlifted back to Australia, comparisons are being drawn between
uniformed young men of past wars and the casualties in Bali.</TE>
<TE>   The comparisons are apt especially in the way the images have
caught the national imagination by showing the Australian ideal of
mate-ship. Viewers were captivated by the eight teenagers on holiday
from Perth. Friends since grade school, only five made it out of
Paddy's Irish Pub right after the nearby blast. They went back into
the blazing ruins to rescue the other three. As one said: "Either all
eight of us are coming home, or none of us are."</TE>
<TE>   They plan to get tattoos that proclaim: Circle of Friends.</TE>
<TE>   As in war, it is the terrible losses inflicted on their young that
have most moved Australians.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't feel like I've lost one brother. It feels like we've
lost six," a sobbing Ryan Thompson told a Sydney Morning Herald
reporter Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson's older brother, Clint, 29, has been confirmed dead in
the bombing as have four of his teammates from Sydney's Coogee
Dolphins rugby team. One more is missing.</TE>
<TE>   They had gone to Bali, along with at least 10 other Australian
teams to celebrate the end of another Southern Hemisphere winter
season. The club's secretary, Mal Ward, said: "We're only a small
club but we're good mates. We've lost half our committee basically."</TE>
<TE>   Craig Salvatori, 39, and his wife, Kathy, 38, were one of eight
Sydney couples who linked up each year for a Bali holiday. This year
they had 15 children among them, including the two Salvatori
daughters.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, they all dined together in Kuta and then Craig took
his daughters back to the hotel so his wife could move on to the Sari
Club to celebrate her birthday with her girlfriends. Kathy and her
friends were believed to have taken the full force of the bomb when
it destroyed the nightclub.</TE>
<TE>   The next day Craig joined other husbands scouring Bali's hospitals
and morgues.</TE>

<HD>Bali Blast Probe Intensifies</HD>
<DH>Indonesia steps up its search for suspects in the deadly
bombing attack. President Megawati weighs a decree allowing
detentions without trial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The search for suspects in the deadly bombing
of Bali nightclubs intensified Wednesday as Indonesian President
Megawati Sukarnoputri weighed whether to issue an emergency decree
that would allow the preventive detention of terrorist suspects
without trial.</LD>
<LD>   Megawati, whose government had long ignored warnings of a
terrorist threat, is considering whether to bypass parliament and
give police broad powers reminiscent of the military dictatorship
that ruled the country until 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities contend that without a new anti-terrorism law, their
hands are tied in combating attacks like the bombing that ripped
through the two Bali nightclubs crowded with foreign tourists
Saturday night, killing more than 180 people.</LD>
<TE>   A senior U.S. diplomat said that several Americans have been
missing since the bombing on the Indonesian resort island and that
the number of Americans killed in the attack could rise to five or
six. Officials have confirmed the deaths of two Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are pursuing a theory that the attack was carried
out by eight men who arrived at the site in two vans. One van, a
Mitsubishi, carried the bomb and was destroyed in the explosion. Two
of the men are believed to be Arabs connected with Osama bin Laden's
Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators initially thought it was unlikely that the bombing
was a suicide mission, but one intelligence expert said that one
attacker might have died in the blast. Authorities are now searching
for seven men -- the two Arabs and five other people -- thought at
one point to have been traveling in a blue Toyota Kijang van.</TE>
<TE>   In the province of East Java, which can be reached by boat from
Bali, police were examining the identification of arriving ferry
passengers and checking suspicious cars on the highway. Police also
stepped up security checks at the airport in Surabaya, the country's
second-largest city.</TE>
<TE>   Albert Sianipar, police chief of operations for the Sidoarjo
district in East Java, said police had stepped up their inspections
since the bombing and had begun using metal detectors to search cars
along highways.</TE>
<TE>   "We are checking to see if they carry weapons or explosives," he
said. "We won't check all cars. But we will check suspicious cars and
cars with more than three or four people."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Wednesday that they have detained two suspects in
Bali, including a Pakistani connected to an identification card found
near the scene of the explosion. Police said the two were held after
they were evasive in answering questions, but it is unclear what role
they might have played in the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials had been warning Indonesia for more than a year
that terrorists were active in the country and could carry out a
major attack on several possible targets. But the United States had
no information about a planned attack in Bali and did not give
Indonesia a specific warning of the bombing, the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of a continuing threat to Americans in Indonesia, the
State Department has ordered family members and all nonessential
personnel at the U.S. Embassy to leave the country in the next few
days.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, American
diplomats have been pushing Indonesia to take tougher action against
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The emergency decree under consideration here could give police a
strong hand in dealing with suspected terrorists, but it could also
touch off a backlash from Muslim activists and civil libertarians
concerned that it would signal a return to the days of dictatorial
rule.</TE>
<TE>   The main target of the anti-terrorism provisions would probably be
Jemaah Islamiah. Authorities in the region say the radical Islamic
group linked to Al Qaeda has hatched a variety of terrorist plots in
Southeast Asia, including last year's foiled plan to blow up the U.S.
Embassy in Singapore and six other targets with truck bombs.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore and Malaysia, which both have strong internal security
laws, have detained a total of 98 suspected Jemaah Islamiah members,
including five arrested Wednesday in Malaysia. Members of the group
also have been arrested in the Philippines, but not in Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those held have identified the leader of Jemaah Islamiah
as Indonesian cleric Abu Bakar Bashir, who lives freely in the
province of Central Java. The Indonesian government has declined to
arrest him, saying there is no hard evidence of his involvement in a
crime. Bashir denies heading the group, which he contends does not
exist.</TE>
<TE>   Western governments suspect that Bashir, 64, may have been behind
the Bali bombing, but he denies the charge. Instead, he claims that
U.S. personnel and Israeli intelligence services carried out the
attack to undermine Islamic groups and show that terrorists were
operating in Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Wednesday, Bashir said he condemned the bombing
"because it is not according to the teachings of Islam." He said he
gave his condolences to the victims, especially to those from
Australia, which appears to have suffered the largest number of
casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir said he advocates not just an Islamic state in Southeast
Asia but also an Islamic world that would live under the strict code
of Sharia law.</TE>
<TE>   "I want Islam to regulate the world's people so it is safe," he
said. "I believe that Muslims and non-Muslims will only feel safe
under Islamic law."</TE>
<TE>   Bashir said he believes that Western countries, led by the U.S.
and Israel, are waging war against Islam, action that justifies
violence by Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   "If they attack Islam with arguments, we will fight back with
arguments, but if they fight with weapons, we will fight back with
weapons," he said. "That is the teaching of Islam. We are just
defending ourselves. We never start. But the U.S. and the Jews always
start using weapons."</TE>
<TE>   Bashir is scheduled to meet with police this week to discuss a
$107.6-million lawsuit he filed Wednesday against Time magazine for
alleging that he had links to terrorism. Police could use the
opportunity to detain Bashir if the new anti-terrorism regulations
are in place.</TE>
<TE>   The hunt for clues in the rubble of Bali's nightclub district has
become an international effort, with forensic experts, body
identification teams and bomb blast specialists from the U.S.,
Australia, Britain, Germany and France joining in.</TE>
<TE>   Australia has offered $1 million in U.S. dollars in reward for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of the bombers.
Indonesia and Australia also have agreed to form a joint intelligence
team -- an unprecedented move for two countries often at odds over
issues such as asylum-seeker smuggling and independence for East
Timor.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials welcomed Indonesia's new willingness to address the
problem of terrorism and increase the level of cooperation with other
countries.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bali disaster clearly got their attention," the senior U.S.
diplomat said. "For the time being, the important thing is that we're
all on the same sheet of paper as far as what needs to be done. The
government of Indonesia has a problem. It realizes that, and it's
determined to address it."</TE>

<HD>Russian Catholics Decry Story About Monastery Brothel</HD>
<DH>False newspaper report is seen by some as part of a smear
campaign by the nation's Orthodox Church, which denies involvement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Daniszewski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MOSCOW -- "Nuns" in bloomers and a brothel in a Franciscan monastery
-- the story was too juicy to ignore, said a reporter for Russia's
biggest-selling newspaper. Editors made her original story even
juicier by concocting details and commissioning a suggestive
illustration.</LD>
<LD>   But the report printed last week by Komsomolskaya Pravda was
false, in the first place, and circumstances surrounding it indicate
that the Roman Catholic Church in Russia might have been deliberately
set up.</LD>
<LD>   The Vatican issued a formal protest this week. Many Catholics here
see the story, which also was featured on national television
broadcasts, as part of a campaign by the Russian Orthodox Church, and
perhaps the government, to discredit and defame them.</LD>
<TE>   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the Russian newspaper
and television reports were "despicable" and "deceitfully
constructed." Anatoly Pchelintsev, a Russian lawyer for the
Franciscans, said the reports were part of a smear campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian patriarchate, which has accused the Roman Catholic
Church of trying to compete against it in Russia, denied that the
Orthodox Church had anything to do with planting the stories.</TE>
<TE>   "The allegations can be explained as careless journalism rather
than an organized campaign," said Orthodox Church spokeswoman Yelena
Speranskaya. "If there are any accusations against the Russian
Orthodox, I can only explain it as an attitude [by Catholics]
bordering on paranoia."</TE>
<TE>   Father Nikolai Dubinin, a spokesman for the Franciscan order in
Russia, said two adjoining apartments owned by the community since
1997 were subleased in January to a woman who promised to upgrade the
premises and use them for a charitable program to "develop the
talents of children."</TE>
<TE>   Priests, brothers and seminary students had lived in the
apartments and operated a religious publishing house there. They
needed to move because they had outgrown the space, Dubinin said.</TE>
<TE>   But the new tenant, identified by church officials as Marina
Tikhonova, remodeled the rooms, installed security cameras outside
and decorated the street entrance with red and blue hearts. Police
informed the Franciscan community in February that the property,
still registered in the name of a Franciscan scholar, had become a
brothel, Dubinin said.</TE>
<TE>   Repeated efforts since then to get police, city authorities and
the courts to close the establishment and evict the tenants have
failed, Dubinin said. He denied that the community is receiving any
rent and said it would not take the money even if offered.</TE>
<TE>   The Oct. 7 article in Komsomolskaya Pravda, however, contained
nothing to suggest that the brothel was not working with the consent
of the Franciscans. Similar reports appeared on the main state
television channel and on a syndicated program called "Russian
House." The latter is considered close to the Russian Orthodox
Church.</TE>
<TE>   "Moscow Monastery Turned Out to Be a Brothel," said the newspaper
headline. "Today, anyone who is well-heeled and fancies erotic
exotica is welcome to pay a visit to a monastery and have a good time
in the company of young 'nuns,' " the article said. Next to the
report, the paper printed a composite of a slim young woman in black
bra and panties, wearing a nun's veil, stretched out languorously on
a chair behind a man in the costume of a hooded friar.</TE>
<TE>   The author, Anna Selivanova, defended her work, saying "police
sources" had alerted her to an intriguing story. In a telephone
interview, she admitted that she knew that the Franciscans were not
behind the brothel, but she said she wanted to make the story more
interesting for readers.</TE>
<TE>   The priests should have been more careful about their tenant, she
added.</TE>
<TE>   "The line about the nuns-prostitutes -- it was used in quotes and
inserted into the story by our editor to boost the effect," she said.
"You understand that copy needs to be sold, that readers must be made
to want to read it."</TE>
<TE>   Pchelintsev, who has filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Franciscans
to evict the tenant, was not buying the explanation. "There is
clearly a political order here," he said. "The people who ordered the
articles are the ones who have been running a rabid anti-Catholic
campaign in Russia lately."</TE>
<TE>   He said he had "serious grounds" to suspect that the woman who
rented the apartments was in from the beginning on a plan to
embarrass the church. "She behaves so brazenly, as if she knows there
are some bigwigs behind her," he said, "as if she is sure she has the
backing she needs."</TE>
<TE>   Although operating a brothel is illegal in Russia, it is
widespread and directories are even printed.</TE>
<TE>   Dubinin said when the Franciscans finally persuaded police to
visit the establishment and tell the tenants to leave, the people
inside called their own police contingent. Both groups of officers
milled about outside the locked door for some time, and nothing
happened.</TE>
<TE>   "Their police protection turned out to be more powerful than our
police protection," he said ruefully.</TE>
<TE>   In the long run, however, people will see through the tricks, he
said: "We live by the Gospel, which says that nothing is hidden that
cannot be revealed."</TE>

<LD>Three people were reportedly killed and at least 23 wounded when two
bombs ripped through the shopping center of the largely Christian
city of Zamboanga in the southern Philippines, officials said. No
group claimed responsibility, but authorities said they suspected
radicals fighting for an Islamic state.</LD>
<LD>   "I have heard there are people dead, but I have no confirmation.
There are 23 people being treated in hospitals right now," Zamboanga
Mayor Maria Clara Lobregat said. Manila radio stations said at least
three people were killed.</LD>

<LD>A power struggle in the party of assassinated anti-immigration
politician Pim Fortuyn has broken apart the Dutch government, setting
the stage for early elections.</LD>
<LD>   Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said he was submitting his
resignation and that of his Cabinet to Queen Beatrix. He will become
caretaker prime minister pending new elections.</LD>
<LD>   Balkenende said bickering between two Cabinet ministers from the
Pim Fortuyn's List party undermined the party's credibility with its
coalition partners, including Balkenende's Christian Democratic

<LD>Ten policemen in Manisa, Turkey, were convicted of torturing
teenagers for putting up leftist posters and were sentenced to at
least five years in prison, media reports said.</LD>
<LD>   The case began when 15 leftist activists, ages 14 to 18, were
arrested in 1995 for putting up political posters in Manisa. Their
lawyers said the youths were beaten, shocked, hosed down with
pressurized water and sexually abused. The youths' convictions for
membership in leftist organizations were overturned by an appeals
court that said their confessions were extracted under torture.</LD>

<LD>Jamaica's ruling People's National Party won a closely contested
national election, claiming a fourth consecutive term in a vote
largely free of the violence of past elections. Unofficial results
showed the PNP won 35 seats to 25 for the opposition Jamaica Labor
Party.</LD>
<LD>   But the results represented a PNP loss of 13 seats in the 60-seat
House of Representatives, and only a 5% margin in the popular vote, a
sign of discontent in a nation plagued by violent crime and a sagging
economy. Seven people were shot to death near the town of Rock Hall,
but police said the crime was not politically motivated.</LD>

<LD>These are excerpts from the first day of a two-day U.N. Security
Council debate on Iraq. Council members, including the United States,
will speak last.</LD>
<LD>   U.N. Secretary-General</LD>
<LD>   Kofi Annan</LD>
<TE>   (in a statement read by Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette)</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq has to comply. It must implement the disarmament program
required by our resolutions.... The inspectors must have unfettered
access. The council will expect nothing less. It may well choose to
pass a new resolution strengthening the inspectors' hand, so that
there are no weaknesses or ambiguities. I consider such a step would
be appropriate.... If Iraq fails to make use of this last chance, and
defiance continues, the council will have to face its
responsibilities."</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi Ambassador</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Douri</TE>
<TE>   "In fact, there is absolutely no need for a new resolution to be
adopted in the Security Council. The attempts of the United States of
America to hamper and delay the return of the inspectors, and their
attempt to make the Security Council adopt a new resolution
establishing conditions which are impossible to respect, aims at
establishing a pretext to cover aggression against Iraq with the
purpose of colonizing our country."</TE>
<TE>   Kuwaiti Ambassador</TE>
<TE>   Mohammad Abulhasan</TE>
<TE>   "Unilateral actions taken as a result of being in a position of
power could down the road prove to be as ineffective as reluctance to
pitch in as a result of weakness.... Any use of force must be a last
resort and within the United Nations framework and only after all
other available means have been exhausted."</TE>
<TE>   South African Ambassador</TE>
<TE>   Dumisani Kumalo</TE>
<TE>   (Speaking on behalf of nonaligned nations)</TE>
<TE>   "It would be inconsistent with the spirit and letter of the United
Nations Charter if the Security Council were to authorize the use of
military force against Iraq at a time when Iraq has indicated its
willingness to abide by the Security Council's resolution."</TE>
<TE>   Australian Ambassador</TE>
<TE>   John Dauth</TE>
<TE>   "The members of the Security Council have a profound
responsibility to ensure that the international community's recent
pressure on Iraq does not go to waste. We urge them to pass a new and
robust Security Council resolution which provides the strongest
possible basis for unconditional and unfettered inspections of Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Tunisian Ambassador</TE>
<TE>   Noureddine Mejdoub</TE>
<TE>   "I say this war is useless because its motives are not well
founded.... This war is useless because U.N. inspectors have been
expected in Baghdad since Sept. 17 to accomplish their mission....
Yes, this war would be more harmful yet because it would unleash a
chain of reactions and counter-reactions in Iraq and in the
region.... The conflict would give extremists a pretext for expanding
war even further."</TE>
<TE>   United Arab Emirates</TE>
<TE>   Ambassador Abdulaziz Shamsi</TE>
<TE>   The United Arab Emirates is "profoundly concerned about the danger
of escalation leading to war in the region." A military strike could
cause "the total destruction of the people of Iraq, as well as the
Gulf and the entire region."</TE>

<DH>Gao Yan, a Central Committee member and a top executive at
a huge power company, was the target of a corruption probe, sources
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Chu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BEIJING -- A member of China's powerful Central Committee, the heart
of the ruling Communist Party, has fled the country to escape a
corruption probe, sources said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Gao Yan, general manager of China's State Power Corp., left the
country last month as authorities investigated him on suspicion of
possible economic misdeeds, a source familiar with the investigation
said.</LD>
<LD>   Gao's destination was not clear, but the Hong Kong-based South
China Morning Post reported Wednesday that he had made his way to a
Western country.</LD>
<TE>   His flight is a potential embarrassment for the Beijing
government, which is striving to appear united and unblemished as it
gears up for a crucial party gathering next month that could see a
major transfer of power to a new generation of leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors of an investigation into Gao have circulated for weeks,
triggering a sharp drop in the value of his company's stock.
Executives at State Power were so alarmed by the plunge that they
called an emergency news conference last week to assert that the
company was doing fine.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their assurances, however, it is an open secret in China
that State Power -- which enjoys a near-monopoly on the power
industry here -- has been the subject of an ongoing corruption probe
for at least two years.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation is a sensitive issue both politically and
economically. The company is closely linked to the country's No. 2
leader, Li Peng, a onetime minister for power whose family members
maintain stakes and even high-ranking positions in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, economic reformers within the Chinese government
have set their sights on busting State Power's lucrative monopoly on
power generation and distribution in China, a stranglehold that has
turned it into one of the richest companies in the world, with assets
worth $153 billion at the end of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Gao, 60, the company's former chairman and currently its general
manager, has not been seen in public since Aug. 29, the 21st Century
Business Herald -- one of China's more daring media outlets --
reported earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   Before being picked to head State Power in 1998, Gao, an engineer
by training, racked up experience and political points as the
governor of Jilin province and the party boss of Yunnan province.
Since 1992, he has sat on the party's powerful Central Committee, an
elite body composed of China's top 200 cadres.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear whether the investigation into Gao's dealings
centered on his tenure at State Power or in his previous posts.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the case, targeting him represents something of a risky
proposition for the Communist regime, given his high political
profile. On the one hand, it is eager to be seen as cracking down on
corruption, the No. 1 public grievance in China. Yet it has also been
careful not to let investigations reach too far up the ladder lest
top leaders find themselves discredited as well.</TE>
<TE>   There was speculation that the probe into Gao, and State Power in
general, forms part of the wider political machinations going on
behind the scenes in China in advance of next month's party congress.
The continuing crackdown on State Power has been interpreted by some
analysts as an indirect way by his rivals of going after Li, a
hard-line leader widely reviled for his key role in the 1989
Tiananmen Square massacre.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, a securities magazine all but accused Li's wife
and his son, Li Xiaopeng, who heads one of State Power's
subsidiaries, of using their political connections for commercial
gain in the power industry. The magazine was forced to run a lengthy
apology days later.</TE>
<TE>   Li is expected to relinquish his position in the Communist Party
hierarchy at next month's gathering, along with President Jiang
Zemin, who is expected to step down from his post as the party's
general secretary.</TE>
<TE>   The Central Committee is also due for considerable turnover.</TE>

<HD>Indonesian Victims' Families Face Lack of Answers</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>KUTA, Indonesia -- Aldo Kansil lies in the intensive care unit of
Sanglah Hospital with severe burns to his face, back, hands and legs.
No one can spare the time to tell his anxious family whether he will
recover.</LD>
<LD>   "His condition is much worse than I thought," said one of his
sisters, Sisca Rompas, 35, who flew in from Jakarta, the capital.
Like many of the families of the local victims, all she can do is
hope for the best.</LD>
<LD>   Terrorists may have targeted tourists, but the wounded foreigners
have been airlifted to safety. There has been little information for
Indonesians, so victims' relatives have come here hoping to find out
what happened.</LD>
<TE>   This Balinese hospital was never designed to deal with an event
like the bombing Saturday night that killed nearly 200 people and
injured hundreds of others. It can handle only about 10 bodies at a
time. Now, 183 unidentified bodies or sets of human remains crowd the
facility. Until new freezers arrived Tuesday, the overflow of victims
spread onto the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Nor can the hospital deal with the hundreds of relatives. Dozens
of families have camped out in the hospital's outdoor corridors,
surrounding themselves with boxes of drinking water, food and changes
of clothes. They have staked out makeshift visiting areas against
walls. They face overburdened medical facilities and get little
information.</TE>
<TE>   Nyomann Manis' husband, Gde Tanggal, was a security guard at the
Paddy Club, the Irish pub across from the Sari Club, both of which
were destroyed by the car bomb.</TE>
<TE>   "He was working the 8:30-to-3 a.m. shift," said Manis, a mother of
two. "He was standing in front of the gate. He's burnt in the face
and arms.</TE>
<TE>   "After I heard what happened I lost the strength to do anything. I
just collapsed."</TE>
<TE>   Now she must rely on the support of her husband's 10 brothers, who
either clean hotel rooms or sell fish at the markets. All of them
took turns on a straw mat outside the emergency care unit.</TE>
<TE>   "We became a victim in this," said Nyomann Sping, a brother.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, volunteers say the medical conditions are rough.</TE>
<TE>   "They are performing miracles here with the little that they've
got," said Lyn Man, an Australian volunteer. "But they need the
expertise coming from the West to make sure they can survive."</TE>
<TE>   "One girl just died 10 minutes ago," said Renee Cogdil, an
American who lives in Bali. "There's a plane here to take her out,
but she couldn't hold on." Her name, Ibu Endang, just got crossed off
the hospital's list of injured patients. Only 32 names remain.</TE>
<TE>   Locals such as Gusti Madita and his 12 relatives are desperate for
answers. They've been sleeping outside the morgue and examining the
dead bodies every day, hoping to find his daughter, Gusti Ayu
Kartini, 34.</TE>
<TE>   "She worked at Paddy's for 15 years," her father said. "She worked
every day except Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't know where she is. He told the hospital staff his
daughter wore a small diamond wedding ring and has a gap between her
teeth. Every day they let him search among the dead. Every day he
finds nothing.</TE>
<TE>   American doctor Arthur Sorrell is a fourth-year resident in
emergency medicine at UCLA Medical Center. He arrived last Thursday
to teach the local doctors about emergency medicine. Instead he got
an education on the scale and limits of local medical care.</TE>
<TE>   "We see multiple trauma in UCLA, but I've never seen mass traumas
where there are literally hundreds of victims," Sorrell said.</TE>
<TE>   The small clinic where he came to teach had only seven beds. That
night more than 60 victims showed up. The doctors had to choose who
had a better chance of survival and send them off to a hospital with
surgeons and intensive care units.</TE>
<TE>   It was hard to treat so many. After Australian doctors arrived at
Sanglah Hospital, they had to find and concentrate on treating their
own nationals.</TE>
<TE>   Cogdil's Balinese friend Deasey Williams will have a better chance
than those left behind. She was flown Wednesday to Australia because
her husband is an Aussie.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was on the second floor of the Paddy Club near the disc
jockey's booth when the bomb exploded. She didn't realize she had
been hurt. She was helping other people. Then she felt the heat on
her body. She jumped into a pool. Someone pulled her out and whisked
her to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "They took all the charred skin from her body," Cogdil said. "She
had hair down to her hips. It was burnt. We had to shave her bald.
She was a beautiful girl."</TE>

<HD>India to Pull Back Troops at Border</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>India said Wednesday that it will withdraw tens of thousands of
troops from its border with Pakistan, but not from the cease-fire
line that divides the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistan welcomed India's move to reduce tensions, but it said
troops on the cease-fire line also should be withdrawn. The announced
pullback "seems to be a positive move," Pakistani Information
Minister Nisar Memon said.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, European Union leaders pressed Indian Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee to move toward dialogue with Pakistan. Memon on
Wednesday also called for resumption of talks.</LD>
<TE>   But in announcing the troop movements, Defense Minister George
Fernandes ruled out any new talks.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question of a dialogue with Pakistan as long as
Pakistani terrorism continues," he said after a meeting of the
Cabinet Committee on Security, headed by Vajpayee.</TE>
<TE>   India accuses Pakistan of funding and training Islamic militants
who cross the frontier to stage attacks in the Indian-held portion of
Kashmir. Pakistan denies that it gives the militants material
support, but Washington has said the rebels are continuing to cross
the Line of Control, a 1972 frontier established after one of the
three wars the nations have fought since they were divided at
independence in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions between the two nuclear-armed countries reached the
boiling point last spring, when militants killed more than two dozen
people in an attack on Indian soldiers' wives and children at an army
housing complex in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Vajpayee
threatened "decisive" action against Pakistan, which responded with a
series of missile tests. India also accused Pakistani-based militants
of a deadly attack on its Parliament in December.</TE>
<TE>   Since those incidents, the two nations have amassed about 1
million troops along their border. Fernandes -- who did not say how
many troops would be withdrawn -- said the army will decide when and
where to move any redeployed soldiers.</TE>

<HD>Mexican Army Unit to Be Disbanded Amid Drug Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Kraul</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MEXICO CITY -- The Mexican army will probably disband an anti-drug
battalion of soldiers in Sinaloa state for suspected involvement in
drug trafficking, a setback for officials who favor using the
military to fight the illegal trade.</LD>
<LD>   The unit of 600 soldiers was confined to quarters in Guamuchil in
northern Sinaloa this month and searched after the National Defense
Ministry received tips that the unit's involvement in the anti-drug
fight had been compromised.</LD>
<LD>   National Defense Secretary Gen. Ricardo Vega Garcia acknowledged
on television this week that members of the unit are being
investigated on suspicion of drug smuggling and possession. Of the 48
soldiers directly implicated, 40 tested positive for drug use and an
unspecified number were found in possession of "sums of money they
couldn't justify," he said.</LD>
<TE>   "The upshot has to be that this unit will be dismantled so as to
[form] something entirely new," Vega Garcia said. "You can't consider
[maintaining] a unit of this type, as contaminated as it is."</TE>
<TE>   Action against the unit came to light last weekend after relatives
complained to human rights officials that they were not allowed on
the base to talk to soldiers. No specific trafficking allegations
against the suspects have yet been leveled by Mexican authorities.</TE>
<TE>   But the incident has reopened the debate on whether the army
should be involved in anti-drug activities. President Vicente Fox's
administration has credited the army with capturing top drug
traffickers, including Tijuana cartel leader Benjamin Arellano Felix
in Puebla in March.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the army's expanded role say troops have committed
numerous human rights offenses in pursuit of traffickers. The
Washington-based Latin American Working Group, a rights organization,
said in a report last week that "basic rights of citizens are being
pushed aside" in the anti-drug fight.</TE>
<TE>   Torture, arrests without warrants and even "extrajudicial
executions of civilians" have resulted from army operations, the
report charged.</TE>
<TE>   Recently retired Gen. Alvaro Vallarta Cecena, now a federal deputy
representing the state of Nayarit, said in an interview Wednesday
that military leaders dislike using troops to fight drugs, but there
is no choice.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no organization to replace the 25,000 troops dedicated
to drug eradication efforts, not the police forces whose integrity
has been compromised, not the federal investigators whom even the
Mexican attorney general has described as still undergoing a process
of 'purification,' " Vallarta said.</TE>
<TE>   "The army has to take the risks [of corruption], like when a
doctor does who attends a sick person. He runs the risk of
contracting the contagious disease," he added.</TE>
<TE>   In the interview broadcast on Televisa network, Vega Garcia denied
media reports that the entire battalion had been detained at its
base, saying the concentration of troops and the inspection that
followed were normal army procedure. But human rights groups said
that 600 army personnel were held for as long as 10 days at their
bases and kept incommunicado.</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Cinco Soto, president of the Sinaloa state human rights
commission in Culiacan, said several army wives called his office
last week to complain about their husbands' detention but have since
shied away from going public for fear of reprisal by the army.</TE>
<TE>   Although most battalion members have been released, some have been
sent to army bases in Mazatlan or Mexico City for further
questioning, according to news reports.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Rights Group Denounces Army</HD>
<DH>Report focuses on the deaths of 15 Palestinians killed by
soldiers in efforts to enforce curfew.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>JERUSALEM -- Israeli human rights advocates on Wednesday blasted the
Israeli army for imposing curfews on the West Bank and Gaza Strip
that deprive Palestinians of their ability to earn a living and at
times their lives.</LD>
<LD>   The report released Wednesday by B'Tselem, a human rights
organization headquartered in Jerusalem, focused on the recent deaths
of 15 Palestinians, eight of them children, who were killed by the
army in its efforts to enforce the curfew.</LD>
<LD>   "Shooting a person simply because he left home during curfew
constitutes an excessive use of force," the report stated. "Curfew is
no longer a tool to meet specific security needs, but a sweeping
means of collective punishment. The prolonged curfew has made
Palestinian life in the West Bank intolerable, forcing the residents
to violate the curfew on occasion."</LD>
<TE>   In a written response to the report, the Israeli army said that
its regulations do not permit soldiers to shoot at curfew violators
unless the soldiers are in danger and that any allegations of such
shootings were under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "The curfew causes suffering. There is a dilemma here. On the one
hand we want to ease the suffering of the Palestinians. But we must
defend ourselves," Maj. Gen. Amos Gilad, the army's coordinator for
the Palestinian territories, told a meeting of diplomats and
journalists.</TE>
<TE>   The most dramatic of the shooting incidents took place in the West
Bank city of Jenin on June 21 when hundreds of residents rushed into
the downtown market to do some shopping in the erroneous belief that
the curfew had been lifted, according to the report. As in many of
the incidents, Palestinians had not been clearly informed that there
was a curfew.</TE>
<TE>   Four people were killed, a 60-year-old schoolteacher and three
children, when a tank opened fire.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmad Shohaneh, a Jenin resident, had gone so far as to call a
friend downtown to verify that the curfew had been lifted before
venturing there with his children, one of whom was killed and two
others injured.</TE>
<TE>   "I got out [of the car] to buy bread and potatoes, and the
children stayed in the car," Shohaneh told the human rights
investigators. "Suddenly, around noon, I heard intense gunfire. The
kids began to scream.... I saw that my son Nail had been injured and
was bleeding. I did not stop, and continued driving to get out of the
gunfire range. When I left the market, I stopped to see how Nail was
... and I was shocked to see her lifeless body [that of his
8-year-old daughter, Sojab]." The army has said that the tank fire
was in error and that the incident is under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In an incident in Nablus on Aug. 11, Ahmad Qureni, a 54-year-old
widower with seven children, was shot to death as he drove a truck
for the municipal electric company during a curfew, despite a
supposed exemption for municipal employees.</TE>
<TE>   A colleague who was in the truck said that an Israeli soldier
fired directly at the windshield from a distance of 25 yards. Video
footage obtained by B'Tselem showed that the truck had a blinking
orange light clearly identifying it as a municipal vehicle, according
to the report. The army said in its statement that disciplinary
action had been taken against an officer and a soldier.</TE>
<TE>   The B'Tselem report also complained that the Israeli army was
shooting tear-gas canisters at close range at curfew violators
"simply to abuse the Palestinians ... [with] no security objective in
mind." In the most recent incident, Sept. 26, the report said an
Israeli soldier fired at a women carrying her 14-month-old grandchild
as they got out of a taxi in Hebron. The baby choked to death from
the fumes, and the grandmother was injured by being struck in the
back of the neck.</TE>
<TE>   In other developments, hundreds of Jewish settlers confronted the
Israeli army at two small illegal outposts in the West Bank that are
to be removed under orders of the Defense Ministry. The incidents
were resolved without violence.</TE>

<HD>N. Korea Discloses Secret Nuclear Arms Program</HD>
<DH>The Communist regime tells visiting U.S. diplomats that it
has not abandoned its pursuit of such weapons, in violation of a 1994
pact.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sonni Efron</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- North Korea has admitted to pursuing a secret nuclear
weapons program using enriched uranium in violation of its 1994
pledge to freeze its nuclear program, senior U.S. officials said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   A visiting delegation of American diplomats confronted North
Korean officials with evidence two weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   The North Koreans initially denied the accusations, but to the
diplomats' amazement, a senior official later acknowledged that the
Communist nation was pursuing the nuclear weapons program "and more."
He would not specify what "more" meant, administration officials
said.</LD>
<TE>   And the North Koreans did not offer to abandon the program in
exchange for U.S. concessions, as they have done in the past, the
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration officials would not say how far along the
nuclear program was, or whether it has a workable atomic bomb and the
means to deliver it.</TE>
<TE>   The officials said that the governments of Japan and South Korea
had been informed and that the administration is now consulting with
Congress and U.S. allies about how to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   "What we seek is a peaceful resolution of this matter ... , " one
official said. "No one wants to see a nuclear-armed North Korea."</TE>
<TE>   The surprise disclosure poses yet another serious challenge to
President Bush's foreign policy team, which is already grappling with
an unstable Afghanistan, the resurgence of suspected Al Qaeda
terrorist attacks from Kuwait to Yemen and Indonesia, and the
prospect of war with Iraq, which the U.S. also suspects of seeking to
develop nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The officials said they did not know why North Korea had confessed
to the weapons program, which one of the officials called "very
serious, a material breach of the agreed framework."</TE>
<TE>   Under the framework, North Korea agreed to freeze its plutonium
weapons program in 1994 in exchange for the construction of civilian
nuclear power reactors by the international community and a 20-year
supply of heating oil while construction is underway.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, intelligence estimates said that North Korea had produced
enough plutonium to make one or two bombs.</TE>
<TE>   That assessment still stands, according to administration
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Nagging suspicions remained that North Korea could be cheating. In
1998, in response to intelligence reports that North Korea had been
digging a massive underground facility in Kumchangri believed to
contain a nuclear weapons development site, the U.S. sent a team of
inspectors to see whether the North Koreans were cheating on their
agreement to abandon a nuclear weapons program. The team found
nothing but an empty cave.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush initially took a hard line on North Korea, freezing
contacts and branding it part of an "axis of evil." But as the North
Koreans began making overtures to South Korea and Japan, including
the unexpected confession to having abducted Japanese citizens,
Washington announced that it would send Assistant Secretary of State
James A. Kelly to Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly's delegation arrived Oct. 3 to meet with North Korean
officials on a wide range of issues, including demands that North
Korea cease development of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic
missiles and other threatening behavior.</TE>
<TE>   When the American team confronted the North Koreans with the
undisclosed evidence of a nuclear program, this one based on enriched
uranium, the North Koreans initially denied the accusation, calling
it a "fabrication" designed to pressure Kim Jong Il's regime. But the
following day, a more senior official, First Foreign Minister Kang
Sok Joo, met with the U.S. delegation.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said Kang told them: "We have a nuclear weapons
program and more."</TE>
<TE>   The Americans said that they did not know why the North Koreans,
considered masters of stonewalling, had decided to confess.</TE>
<TE>   "The last meeting we had was with Kang Sok Joo, and Secretary
Kelly told him in the sternest terms that this was most unwelcome,"
an official said. As to the North Korean reaction, "I would not
describe it as apologetic," the official said. "Kang Sok Joo was
assertive, aggressive about it."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly and his delegation departed Pyongyang on Oct. 5 and flew to
Seoul, where they informed South Korean President Kim Dae Jung. They
then flew on to Tokyo, where they informed Japanese authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The South Korean government was to hold an emergency Cabinet
meeting today to discuss the issue.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear why the North Koreans had embarked on a
uranium-based weapons program, rather than using the plutonium
stockpiles they are believed to have. Uranium-based weapons are
easier to produce and require a less sophisticated design. Because
the first U.S. uranium-based nuclear bombs were dropped in 1945,
there is a wealth of publicly available material about how to make
them, nuclear weapons experts said.</TE>
<TE>   However, crude uranium bombs are big and heavy, so it is unclear
whether the North Koreans would have the technical capability to
mount them onto their Taepodong ballistic missiles, which are
believed to have a range long enough to hit Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   The revelations could cripple the 1994 agreed framework and divide
the U.S. and South Korea at a crucial juncture.</TE>
<TE>   "It has the potential to put the U.S. and South Korea at odds with
each other on an issue that each side sees as critical to its own
security," said an analyst in Seoul. For the United States, weapons
of mass destruction are a top priority, whereas South Koreans are no
longer as afraid of the North as they once were.</TE>
<TE>   What is surprising is not that the North Koreans were cheating,
but that they confessed to it, the analyst said.</TE>
<TE>   "It shouldn't be surprising to anyone that the North continues to
do what it could in this area, because North Korea has its own
security fears," he said, adding that the regime has lost any Cold
War-era assurances that its Communist allies in Beijing and Moscow
would come to its defense if attacked.</TE>
<TE>   "A nuclear weapons program is a poor man's solution to that
dilemma," he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, it was unclear why the Bush administration had chosen
this time to confront North Korea -- or why it kept the North Korean
admission from becoming public for two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Former State Department official Joel Wit, who worked to resolve
the 1994 nuclear crisis and led the inspection team to Kumchangri in
1998, said the Bush administration has three options for dealing with
the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   It could seek negotiations with the North Koreans "and try to
resolve this in a way that addresses our concerns, which is that
they're cheating on an agreement, and to find a face-saving way out,"
said Wit, now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies
in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   He said the administration could also seek a multilateral
agreement to reimpose tough sanctions against North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Or, if North Korea refused to abandon the weapons program, the
Bush administration could threaten a preemptive strike, as it has
done with Iraq, Wit said.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosures will also complicate domestic politics in South
Korea and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   In Seoul, Kim Dae Jung, a lame duck whose party is widely expected
to lose the December presidential election, will be placed on the
defensive in pursuing the "sunshine policy" of engagement with the
North, said Ahn Byung Joon, a Korean security specialist at the
National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   In Japan, the revelations will make it difficult for the
government of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to pursue fast-track
negotiations aimed at normalizing relations with North Korea, Ahn
said.</TE>
<TE>   Japan and South Korea reacted cautiously. Both nations expressed
their belief that the matter should be resolved through dialogue, not
confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi said, "We'd like to ask North Korea to respond sincerely
to wipe out the suspicion of a nuclear weapons program."</TE>
<TE>   Tokyo added that it plans to raise the nuclear issue in
normalization talks with North Korea scheduled for Oct. 29 in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea, in an official statement from the Blue House, the
presidential palace, said Seoul has been in close consultation with
Tokyo and Washington since Kelly's trip.</TE>
<TE>   "In order to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,
the Republic of Korea government calls upon North Korea to fully
comply with all its commitments," it said.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Resolutions Frequently Violated</HD>
<DH>Iraq is not alone in its breaches. Israel and Turkey, among
other countries, have failed to comply with the world body's
stipulations.</DH>

<LD>UNITED NATIONS -- When President Bush chastises the U.N. for letting
Iraq violate 16 Security Council resolutions, what he doesn't mention
is that Iraq is not alone. Nearly 100 U.N. resolutions are being
violated by other countries, and in many cases, a recent study notes,
enforcement is being blocked by the United States or its allies.</LD>
<LD>   The consistent breaches highlight the essential conundrum of the
United Nations: The world body has the power to pass resolutions but
not always the power to enforce them -- creating sometimes
catastrophic situations and, as Bush has charged, eroding its own
relevance.</LD>
<LD>   In a review of five decades of U.N. resolutions, University of San
Francisco professor Stephen Zunes identifies at least 91 resolutions
that clearly are being violated in addition to the Iraq violations.
His analysis suggests that the degree of compliance depends on the
influence of each state and its backers.</LD>
<TE>   Israel, by Zunes' count, is in violation of 31 resolutions. The
violations stem from its refusal to accept the U.N.'s land-for-peace
formula put forward in 1967 and its defiance of a dozen later
resolutions demanding that it cease violations of the Fourth Geneva
Convention for Occupying Powers, such as deportations, demolitions of
homes and seizure of property.</TE>
<TE>   Resolution 487, passed in 1981, has particular resonance in the
debate over Iraq's disarmament because it calls upon Israel to place
its nuclear facilities under the safeguard of the U.N.'s
International Atomic Energy Agency.</TE>
<TE>   The discrepancy is not lost on Iraq. In a speech Wednesday to the
Security Council, Iraqi Ambassador to the U.N. Mohammed Douri pointed
out that by Iraq's reckoning, Israel has refused to implement 28
resolutions, but the U.S. is not talking about invading Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S., one of five veto-holding members of the Security Council
-- along with Britain, France, China and Russia -- has used its veto
more than 40 times to block additional resolutions on Israel.</TE>
<TE>   In second place is Turkey, with 23 breaches following a resolution
in 1974 calling for it to withdraw its troops from Cyprus. When
Turkey -- a member of NATO and key U.S. ally -- did not comply, the
Security Council reiterated its demand 11 more times over a decade.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the Security Council demanded that Turkey at least reduce
its troops and military spending in Cyprus, and repeated that demand
eight more times through 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Morocco has 18 violations, following demands in 1975 that it
withdraw its occupation forces from Western Sahara and in 1991 that
it allow a referendum for Western Saharans on self-determination.</TE>
<TE>   While some resolutions create legally binding obligations under
Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which allows military enforcement,
others function more like formal recommendations that have no teeth
but carry political weight.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the failures to follow them, the Security Council's
decisions do matter," said Robert Rosenstock, former legal counsel
for the U.S. mission at the U.N. "Even if the resolution is not
legally binding, there is a political price to be paid for violating
it."</TE>
<TE>   But the fact that, in most cases, all the U.N. can do is repeat
itself shows the inherent weakness of the world organization: There
is often not enough resolve behind its resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been the dilemma for the U.N.: It has the legal
authority, but not always the means to follow up its decisions," said
Edward Luck, director of the Center on International Organization at
Columbia University. "It's a rare case that they do."</TE>
<TE>   Although the U.N. Charter authorizes military action for
enforcement of Chapter 7 resolutions, there is no formal agreement
about how force should be used. Each time the Security Council deems
military action necessary, its member states must decide the details
among themselves -- an often time-consuming process, with varying
degrees of commitment.</TE>
<TE>   In Bosnia-Herzegovina, a 1995 resolution creating U.N.-protected
"safe havens" for Bosnian Muslims turned into a catastrophe. A safe
haven at Srebrenica became a death trap when Bosnian Serbs overcame
the understaffed Dutch U.N. peacekeepers and massacred thousands of
Bosnian Muslims seeking asylum there.</TE>
<TE>   Despite periodic attempts to guarantee strong enforcement with a
quick-reaction force made up from member nations' troops, the U.S.
has been quick to squelch such efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither the U.S. nor other countries have been willing to allow
international command of their forces," Luck said. "The last thing
the U.S. wants is an independent U.N. throwing its weight around."</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush has castigated the U.N. for its apparent weakness,
historically the United States has not wanted the U.N. to become too
powerful.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Patrick Moynihan, U.S. ambassador to the U.N. in the 1970s,
wrote in his memoirs: "The Department of State desired that the
United Nations prove utterly ineffective in whatever measures it
undertook. The task was given to me, and I carried it forward with
not inconsiderable success."</TE>
<TE>   In the current debate over passing another resolution on Iraq, the
U.S. is asking the U.N. to "prove its relevance" and back a possible
military strike to ensure Iraq's disarmament, an effort Luck calls "a
la carte multilateralism." In other words, he says, the U.S. wants
the U.N. to be effective, as long as it is serving the U.S. agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "They aren't going to allow the organization to dictate things
inconsistent with the objectives of U.S. leadership," Luck said.</TE>

<HD>Pope Adds Meditations to the Rosary</HD>
<DH>The 'Mysteries of Light' are intended to reinvigorate the
practice. John Paul's changes are met with praise as well as yawns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Holley and William Lobdell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>VATICAN CITY -- Putting his personal stamp on a Roman Catholic
tradition virtually untouched in 500 years, Pope John Paul II added a
new set of meditations to the church's beloved rosary Wednesday -- a
move that will alter the way many of the world's estimated 1 billion
Catholics reflect on the life of Jesus Christ.</LD>
<LD>   In terms of official Catholic doctrine, the pope's additions to
the rosary prayers hold little significance because they change no
official church teaching. But John Paul's move resonates deeply among
faithful who were taught from an early age to use the spiritual
discipline of the rosary to grow closer to God through prayer.</LD>
<LD>   "This is going to be of interest to a lot of Catholics," said
Lawrence Cunningham, theology professor at the University of Notre
Dame. "There's no doubt about the fact that if you think about the
popular culture of Catholicism, rosaries are highly symbolic."</LD>
<TE>   In an apostolic letter released on the 24th anniversary of his
pontificate, John Paul also proclaimed the next 12 months as "The
Year of the Rosary." Both moves are intended to reinvigorate the
practice among Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   In Use Since 1569</TE>
<TE>   The rosary used today was standardized by Pope Pius V in 1569 to
give Catholics a uniform interpretation of the life of Christ in
response to the Reformation. It is a form of meditation that uses a
string of beads and repetitive "Hail Mary" prayers to encourage the
faithful to contemplate significant moments, known as mysteries, in
the life of Christ. The suggested additions -- which John Paul has
not made mandatory -- are five meditations on the public ministry of
Jesus, starting with his baptism in the Jordan River and ending with
the Last Supper.</TE>
<TE>   "We must rediscover the profound mysticism contained in the
simplicity of this prayer, dear to popular tradition," the
82-year-old pontiff told pilgrims and tourists during his weekly
audience at St. Peter's Square.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, he wrote, "This addition of these new mysteries,
without prejudice to any essential aspect of the prayer's traditional
format, is meant to give it fresh life and to enkindle renewed
interest in the rosary's place within Christian spirituality."</TE>
<TE>   Initial reaction to John Paul's tweaking of the rosary ranged from
delight to skepticism to yawns.</TE>
<TE>   "I've often heard people say, 'Why don't they include some of
these [other moments in Christ's life]?' " said Father Paul A.
Duffner, a Portland, Ore.-based provincial director of the Rosary
Confraternity, a worldwide movement that promotes the prayer. "The
church is rather concerned about deviations that are not sanctified
by the church. I can see the fruitfulness of what [the pope] has
done."</TE>
<TE>   Vivian Gendernalik, who runs a Florida-based Web site called
customrosaries.com, said she's not sure adding new meditations to the
rosary, which is already often misunderstood, is the best way to
boost interest.</TE>
<TE>   "Adding more work doesn't excite people," said Gendernalik, who
ships two booklets on how to pray the rosary with every order. "It's
a noble idea ... [but] it's burdening a public that doesn't know how
to pray the 15 mysteries that already exist. This is going to pass
over most people's heads."</TE>
<TE>   Importance Minimized</TE>
<TE>   Academics and others point out that individual Catholics already
have their own customized versions of the rosary that include
meditations on Christ's public ministry. "If you were to rate papal
[actions] on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most important,
this is a 1.5 at most," Cunningham said.</TE>
<TE>   Before the pontiff's announcement, Catholics had been taught to
reflect daily on one of three sets of scenes from the Gospels. "The
Joyful Mysteries" focus on the birth of Jesus. "The Sorrowful
Mysteries" center on the crucifixion. And "The Glorious Mysteries"
reflect on the resurrection.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul added the "Mysteries of Light" to fill in key scenes of
Christ's public ministry between his birth and death. In addition to
his baptism and the Last Supper, the new meditations center on his
first miracle at the wedding in Cana, where the Gospel says he turned
water into wine; his proclamation of the coming of the Kingdom of
God; and his transfiguration, when he changes to his divine self
before his disciples and shows them what he will be like in the
kingdom to come.</TE>
<TE>   In his apostolic letter, John Paul said he was making the changes
"to counter a certain crisis of the rosary," which risks being
"wrongly devalued, and therefore no longer taught to the younger
generation."</TE>
<TE>   "At the start of a millennium which began with the terrifying
attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, a millennium which witnesses every day in
numerous parts of the world fresh scenes of bloodshed and violence,
to rediscover the rosary means to immerse oneself in contemplation of
the mystery of Christ," John Paul said in the letter.</TE>

<HD>It's Unanimous: Everyone Votes to Keep Hussein</HD>
<DH>Iraqi official says the referendum should send an
unmistakable message to Washington.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BAGHDAD -- Every one of Iraq's 11,445,636 eligible voters turned out
for a national referendum this week and every one of them voted in
favor of keeping Saddam Hussein as president, Iraqi officials said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The results were announced at a news conference in a government
hall by Izzat Ibrahim, vice chairman of the Revolutionary Command
Council. The redheaded, longtime ally of Hussein did not bristle at
the suggestion that a 100% tally might not be perceived by everyone
in the international community as credible. Instead, he smiled.</LD>
<LD>   "Someone who does not know the Iraqi people, he does not believe
this percentage. But it is real," Ibrahim said. "Whether it looks
that way to someone or not, we don't have opposition in Iraq."</LD>
<TE>   The victory claim, which bested Iraqi insistence seven years ago
during the last referendum that only 0.04% of voters then opposed
Hussein's rule, was particularly audacious as it came on a day the
United Nations met to debate how to force Iraq to surrender any
weapons of mass destruction it might possess.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the White House had discounted the Iraqi vote
Tuesday when it was held. "Obviously, it's not a very serious day,
not a very serious vote and nobody places any credibility on it,"
Press Secretary Ari Fleischer told Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Voters were asked Tuesday to participate in the second referendum
on Iraq's leadership. Hussein, 65, has been president since 1979. He
rules by decree and by fear, and when Ibrahim says there is no
opposition, he is right that none has been permitted. But even this
authoritarian regime has tried to dress itself up with a veneer of
democracy in hopes of earning a greater degree of legitimacy here and
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Though Ibrahim insisted that the voting was not aimed at trying to
prove anything to the United States, he did say the message should be
unmistakable.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is an aggression, the United States will have to face
these people who said 'yes' to Saddam Hussein," he said. "If they
come, we will fight them in every village and every house. Every
house will be a front, and every Iraqi will have a role in the war."</TE>
<TE>   But a European diplomat here who requested anonymity saw a far
different message aimed at the U.S. and the world. "The message was,
'Look, we are still able to control all the population, and if you
think it will be easy to control, you might be wrong,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   The first referendum confirming Hussein for a seven-year term as
president took place in 1995, when he claimed a victory of 99.96%.</TE>
<TE>   This time, at least one European diplomat based here had placed a
bet with a colleague that Hussein would receive a more credible
figure. The diplomat said the regime's recent diplomatic maneuvers in
the high-stakes game with the U.S. had been very smart and he
calculated that the same thinking would extend to the vote.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a bet saying the regime will be clever and the final
result will not be 97% but will be 75 to 80%," said the diplomat, who
requested anonymity and did not disclose how much he will have to pay
out.</TE>
<TE>   With only one candidate on the referendum, there was little doubt
about the results. Still, Ibrahim said, "This is a unique
manifestation of democracy which is superior to all other forms of
democracy."</TE>
<TE>   Another European diplomat based here said the country, and the
regime in particular, is so isolated that it has begun to believe its
own propaganda. "The logic here is sometimes so difficult to
understand," the diplomat said. "They start believing in it."</TE>
<TE>   The lead-up to Tuesday's vote had the feel of a great national
celebration, and the authorities declared Wednesday a national
holiday even before the votes were fully counted.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of foreigners were flown in and put up at government
expense. The city, always decorated with murals, mosaics and statues
of the president, had even more posters, pictures and displays in
Hussein's honor. The scene at polling places was frenzied, at least
while foreign journalists were present, with some people going so far
as to mark their ballots with their own blood.</TE>
<TE>   The vote, which was all done on hand-marked paper ballots, was
somehow tallied overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the announcement was made, the celebration began.
Fifteen sheep were slaughtered in the driveway outside the Al Rashid
Hotel. As the staff washed away the blood, the meat was taken inside
and prepared for the guests. Gunfire echoed across the city as people
fired weapons into the air.</TE>
<TE>   And at the news conference, Ibrahim, dressed in a suit instead of
his customary green military uniform and beret, read a lengthy speech
illustrating the depth of Iraqis' adulation of the president.</TE>
<TE>   His remarks portrayed the president as a leader for all ages, a
man who will take his place in history alongside such admired figures
as Saladin, the Kurdish fighter born in Tikrit, Hussein's hometown,
who defeated the Crusaders in the 12th century.</TE>
<TE>   "You have chosen a historic leader who acquired all the qualities
of leadership defined by our forefathers," Ibrahim said in his
statement. "These are qualities God sought to have imbued in their
leader.</TE>
<TE>   "You have chosen the wise man of the Arabs and one of the great
leaders who cannot be replaced by anybody," he added. "Let his
enemies be cornered. They are condemned by God."</TE>
<TE>   The president did not make any appearance.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Send Envoy to Mideast</HD>
<DH>Administration seeks to jump-start the peace process and
keep Israel on sidelines in case of war with Iraq. Bush and Sharon
hold talks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- In an attempt to neutralize the "Israel factor" in any
showdown with Iraq, President Bush announced Wednesday that the
United States is dispatching a top envoy to try to jump-start the
Middle East peace process.</LD>
<LD>   Bush also pressed Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon during talks
at the White House to sit on the sidelines if a U.S.-led coalition
launches a military offensive against Iraq. The president
acknowledged publicly, however, that Israel has the right to
retaliate if attacked.</LD>
<LD>   "If Iraq attacks Israel tomorrow, I would assume the prime
minister would respond. He's got a desire to defend himself," Bush
said during a brief joint appearance before reporters in the Oval
Office.</LD>
<TE>   But U.S. officials cautioned that Bush was not offering a green
light for retaliation, only an understanding of Israel's defense
concerns. A White House official also said that although the
administration expects Israel to stay out of the fight, it knows the
Israelis would be unlikely to remain passive if they are the victims
of an unprovoked Iraqi missile attack.</TE>
<TE>   The administration promised Sharon that if a war against Iraq is
launched, he will be given more than the 48-hour notice that he
received on the eve of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan last
year, according to  sources. Israel has asked for enough advance
notice to prepare its defenses against possible Scud missile attacks
by the Iraqis.</TE>
<TE>   For Sharon, the focus of Wednesday's talks was coordination in the
event of a war against Iraq. But Bush emphasized the Arab-Israeli
conflict -- an almost dormant foreign policy issue now despite the
president's controversial initiatives over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Bush outlined a roadmap for a permanent peace, which
included a call for the Palestinians to change their leadership in
exchange for a promise of an independent state within three years.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is dispatching Assistant Secretary of
State William J. Burns today on a two-week swing through the Middle
East to generate movement, particularly in getting the Palestinians
to reform their institutions and minimize the role of Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Burns will travel to Israel, the West Bank, Egypt, Saudi Arabia,
Syria, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain,
Yemen and Oman, U.S. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The envoy will "work toward achieving concrete, real, objective,
measurable reforms so that there's a peaceful future for the region,"
Bush said as he began talks with Sharon. Moderate Arab governments
have been putting pressure on the administration to try to defuse
tensions between Israel and the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to prod the peace process forward, Bush won agreement
from Sharon to "consider favorably" the gradual return of millions of
dollars in Palestinian tax revenue that has been collected by Israel
and withheld since 2000, money the Palestinian Authority says it
needs to alleviate the desperate economic conditions brought about by
two years of fighting with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, Washington pledged full U.S. monitoring of the income
"to ensure that these funds will only be used for the economic and
civil activities of the Palestinian community, and to prevent the use
of these funds for terrorist activity of any kind," according to a
joint statement.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also pledged support for Israel if tensions heat up along the
border with Lebanon, where there have been sporadic clashes with
Hezbollah guerrillas backed by Iran and Syria.</TE>
<TE>   "We are making it clear we will fight terror wherever it exists,"
Bush said. "We expect Hezbollah not to attack our friend."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush-Sharon talks were the seventh meeting since the two
leaders took office last year. It came at a time of unusual tensions
in the relationship. The United States has been irritated by Israel's
defiance of its admonitions to end its siege of about half a dozen
West Bank towns and by its destruction of Arafat's headquarters in
Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has also been concerned about the mounting impact of
the humanitarian crisis among Palestinians: Unemployment and poverty
are soaring, and malnutrition among children is rampant.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli leader praised the Bush administration's close
cooperation with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that we never had such relations with any president of
the United States as we have with you. And we never had such
cooperation in everything as we have with the current
administration," Sharon told Bush in front of reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon also held talks Wednesday with Vice President Dick Cheney,
National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld. He is scheduled to meet with Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell today.</TE>

<HD>Compromise on Iraq Is Offered</HD>
<DH>U.S. proposal calls for 'consequences' if inspections are
blocked but would not authorize immediate military action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright, Tyler Marshall and Edwin Chen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Bowing to pressure from France and Russia, the United
States on Wednesday offered a compromise proposal that would call for
serious "consequences" if Iraq does not comply with tough weapons
inspections -- but would not seek authorization for military action
without further discussions at the world body.</LD>
<LD>   The compromise, outlined Wednesday by Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell in telephone conversations with his French and Russian
counterparts, calls for one Security Council resolution that will
send U.N. weapons inspectors back to Iraq with sweeping orders to
track any nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles, U.S. sources said.</LD>
<LD>   But in a bid to end a monthlong diplomatic deadlock and satisfy
demands of its Security Council partners, the U.S. also would agree
not to automatically launch a military operation against Iraq if
Hussein fails to disarm. Instead, the Bush administration would have
to go back to the council for additional debate -- and a possible
second resolution authorizing U.N. members to act, the sources said.</LD>
<TE>   If the Security Council cannot agree on a course of action, then
the United States has the prerogative to form its own coalition to
forcibly disarm Iraq, they added.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. move is a crucial step that would appear to meet the
insistence on the part of several Security Council members -- but
articulated most vocally by France -- that the Bush administration
not be allowed to launch military strikes against the regime of Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein without first returning to the Security Council
to debate the consequences if the inspectors determine their work is
being obstructed.</TE>
<TE>   Elements of the diplomatic breakthrough came on a day that was
heavy with public rhetoric on the Iraq crisis.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, President Bush signed a congressional measure
authorizing him to wage war against Iraq, and he called for
immediate, decisive action against Hussein to "fully and finally
remove a real threat to world peace and America." At the United
Nations, ambassadors from scores of nations urged the Security
Council in a debate to take a more measured approach to restart the
process of disarming Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking from the ornate East Room of the White House and
surrounded by powerful members of Congress, Bush used direct, tough
language to make the case for confronting Hussein without delay.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who choose to live in denial may eventually be forced to
live in fear," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As he spoke, details were being worked out behind the scenes for
the diplomatic compromise expected to pave the way toward passage of
a resolution by the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   "We have floated language with the French and Russians that says
if the weapons inspectors report violations, then the Security
Council can meet and consider what action it can and should take," a
senior State Department official said Wednesday. "That language is
coupled with a strong resolution that gives clear instructions to the
weapons inspectors and warns that Iraq faces real consequences if it
fails to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   "This represents an attempt to find a way to achieve our goals but
also accommodate others," the senior official added. "And in the end
it does not take away from the president's prerogative to act as he
sees fit."</TE>
<TE>   The administration now expects the compromise to be accepted by
France and Russia, a move that is then expected to bring along China,
which has been less vocal on the disputed issues.</TE>
<TE>   The administration expects to hear back from the French and
Russians as early as today, U.S. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Ginette de Matha, spokeswoman at the French mission in New York,
declined to comment on the U.S. offer, stating only, "We are
continuing to negotiate."</TE>
<TE>   More Optimism</TE>
<TE>   However, one well-placed U.S. official was optimistic enough about
the impending deal on a resolution that he predicted: "The paint has
finally dried."</TE>
<TE>   While traveling in Alexandria, Egypt, French President Jacques
Chirac reiterated his opposition to an earlier U.S. proposal for a
single Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force
against Iraq, but added that France was open to a measure improving
"the work conditions of the disarmament inspectors of the U.N., as
requested by the chief of the inspectors, Hans Blix, in whom France
has confidence."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview for state TV Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister
Igor S. Ivanov echoed the French leader. "If attempts are made to
submit a resolution whose aim is to create the legal grounds for use
of force scenarios, it will not be in the interests of settling the
situation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's compromise proposal, which would allow both the U.S.
and France to declare a diplomatic victory, is designed to generate
movement now that Bush has a domestic resolution authorizing a
showdown with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer later clarified
Bush's call to "remove a real threat," saying it referred not just to
ridding Iraq of any weapons of mass destruction but also of Hussein
himself.</TE>
<TE>   "He's talking about both," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   During the East Room ceremony, Bush acknowledged -- to a greater
extent than he has previously -- the mortal dangers American soldiers
would face in a war in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "If we go into battle, as a last resort, we will confront an enemy
capable of irrational miscalculations, capable of terrible deeds,"
the president warned. "As the commander in chief, I know the risks to
our country. I'm fully responsible to the young men and women in
uniform who may face these risks. Yet those risks only increase with
time. And the costs could be immeasurably higher in years to come.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope the use of force will not be necessary," Bush added, but
he did not seem optimistic about such a prospect. "Our goal is to
fully and finally remove a real threat to world peace and to America.
Confronting grave dangers is the surest path to peace and security."</TE>
<TE>   As he spoke, the president was joined on stage by an array of
Democratic and Republican lawmakers, along with Vice President Dick
Cheney, Powell and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld.</TE>
<TE>   After signing the congressional resolution, which passed the House
and Senate by large margins last week, Bush looked up, jutted out his
chin and nodded emphatically.</TE>
<TE>   The congressional resolution, he said, "symbolizes the united
purpose of our nation," and he added, "We will face our dangers
squarely, and we will face them unafraid."</TE>
<TE>   His words were seen as a direct challenge to the United Nations to
seize its chance to end years of Hussein's defiance of the world body
and pass a strong resolution that would send U.N. weapons inspectors
back with new, tough ground rules to disarm Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Hawks on the Iraq issue within the administration have urged the
U.S. to lead a military operation against Hussein's regime at the
first sign of Iraqi obstruction with the work of U.N. inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   After meeting later with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, Bush
stressed the need for agreement at the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   "There are differing opinions on members of the Security Council,
and we've got to work hard to reach a consensus, a resolution that
will, on the one hand, do everything it can to disarm Saddam Hussein
and also has got the capacity for there to be consequences should he
not disarm."</TE>
<TE>   In offering the diplomatic compromise, the Bush administration is
seeking to avoid an open-ended negotiating process that could slow
the disarmament effort, which has been on hold since U.N. weapons
inspectors left Iraq in 1998. In additional moves to ensure swift
action by the world body now, the Americans are also considering
further compromises or, more likely, dropping three other contentious
provisions in their original proposal for a U.N. resolution, U.S.
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Washington had originally called for armed escorts for the
inspectors to ensure that access is not blocked, for the right to
take Iraqi scientists or military officers out of the country for
interviews about Baghdad's arms programs, and for representatives of
the five permanent members of the Security Council to accompany the
inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   All three conditions have long been considered part of the
so-called "negotiating fat" likely to be either toned down or cut,
according to U.N. sources. Just how far Washington is willing to go
may depend on the French and Russian reaction, U.S. officials
indicated.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't yet decided how far we are willing to go," the State
Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States has prerogatives right now. All we want is to
make sure that whatever action the Security Council decides on is
good, and we'll participate in that discussion. It's a pretty active
discussion right now. Nothing has been promised but we believe it
will be soon.</TE>
<TE>   "There'll be one resolution, and if the Security Council wants a
second one, fine," the official added. "If it doesn't, the president
can do what [he] wants later on."</TE>
<TE>   Calls for Restraint</TE>
<TE>   The flurry of diplomatic activity came as U.N. ambassadors from an
array of nations called for a more measured approach toward Iraq --
one giving U.N. weapons inspectors the chance to carry out an
intensive search for nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "The government of Iraq has said the inspectors should come, so we
should go ahead and allow the inspectors to go," South African
Ambassador Dumisani Kumalo told the 15-member Security Council. "We
don't see why we should start discussing attacking Iraq before we
even allow the inspectors to go in and do their work. Then they will
come back and report to the council and the council can think what
next to do."</TE>
<TE>   Even Kuwait, which was invaded by Hussein's forces in 1990 and
liberated by an American-led coalition six months later, cautioned
restraint.</TE>
<TE>   It was a rare chance for the world body's smaller countries to air
their views in what has become the weeks-long struggle for agreement
on Iraq between the Security Council's five major powers--the U.S.,
Britain, France, Russia and China.</TE>

Angels players, coaches, front-office personnel and ownership. For
all of us who preceded you, you finally got the monkey off of our
collective backs and in his rightful place, as a rally mascot. You
have proven that a team is greater than the sum of its players. You
have created a bond between the players and the fans. But most of
all, you have given us the very best that our national pastime has to
offer -- a piece of Americana. There may be no joy in Mudville, but
there is happiness in Anaheim, and through all this a certain cowboy
smiles down from the heavens.</LD>

<TE>   The Angels are in the World Series, and as a true (not bandwagon)
Angel fan I couldn't be more delighted. My son Marcus and I have been
fortunate to be at all the playoff games, and each has been more
thrilling than the last. After defeating the Twins on Sunday, it was
an emotional moment when the Angels ran back onto the field to
acknowledge and thank the fans. When Tim Salmon ran back with the
trophy I was ready to burst with joy and pride. Regardless of how the
series goes, this team is to be commended for providing its fans with
highlights we can replay in our minds forever. Thank you, Angels, for
a great season. This team has talent, heart and real class.</TE>

<LD>Our plate is full! Will someone please inform President Bush. A Bali
nightclub has been bombed, with many deaths ("Al Qaeda Blamed for
Bali Bombing," Oct. 15). An oil tanker has been attacked, Marines in
Kuwait were shot at and killed, the Philippines is under attack, a
sniper is loose in Washington and President Pervez Musharraf in
Pakistan is slipping.</LD>
<LD>   The president does not seem to have enough and wants to start some
more fires. Who will pay for all this? He beats the war drums and
Republicans fall in behind him as the USS Economy is sinking. When
will we have enough?</LD>

<TE>   I have vacationed in Bali. The people there are beautiful and
peace-loving, in an environment that has been described as heaven on
Earth. Because of the horrible bombing by Al Qaeda, many young adults
were killed or maimed or, at the very least, scarred for life. Bali
will no doubt suffer economically because of a drop in tourism.</TE>
<TE>   It does not take a PhD to figure that Saddam Hussein is to some
degree aligned with Al Qaeda. The terrorism they inflict on innocent
people divide nations and religions, rally killing and hate and seem
to rhyme with the beginnings of Armageddon. I am solidly behind any
political or military agenda whose primary purpose is the elimination
of terrorism on this planet.</TE>

<TE>   In 1990, we are reminded, Hussein took Western hostages to be used
as "human shields" because he knew that our country "would be too
squeamish to blow up targets to which its citizens were strapped."
Now the U.N. wants to send inspectors to search his arsenal. I wonder
if this isn't the easiest way for him to get an ample supply of human
pawns to blackmail us.</TE>

<TE>   Back in the '60s we were warned that if we didn't stop communism
in Vietnam, we would have a domino effect and all of the East would
fall to communism. Should we have said no to war in Vietnam? And
should we say no to war in Iraq? If we do blunder into a conflict, we
will face the grave possibility of mass attacks in return. If we do
our best to contain Hussein, we may face a mass attack.</TE>

<TE>   In still another effort by this administration to build support
for invading Iraq, missing Gulf War pilot Michael S. Speicher has
been declared "captured" (Oct. 12). The evidence? There's no proof
he's dead. Of course, as Navy Secretary Gordon England acknowledges,
there's no "definitive" proof he's "alive and in Iraqi custody"
either. So England just says it is his "firm belief" that Iraq knows
what happened to him. In other words, forget evidence, we're going
with our feelings.</TE>

<TE>   In response to an Oct. 10 letter regarding Americans having no
problem recognizing their enemies as Germany and Italy after the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor: For the period Dec. 7 to Dec. 10,
1941, the U.S. said nothing about war against Germany and Italy. On
Dec. 11 Germany declared war on the U.S., even though it was not
obliged to under the terms of the tripartite agreement between Japan,
Germany and Italy. Later that day the U.S. Congress declared war on
Germany and Italy. The question is, what would the U.S. have done if
Germany had not declared war on the U.S.?</TE>

<LD>In his Oct. 12 letter on the "Enrique's Journey" series, Cardinal
Roger Mahony once again encourages illegal immigration to the U.S. He
cites the poor economic conditions in Mexico. Much of Mexico's poor
condition is caused by corruption and bribery, etc. Mexico is a
largely Catholic country, but I have never heard Catholic spiritual
leaders address the issues of corruption, bribery and dishonest
business ethics that hold down Mexico's economy. President Vicente
Fox has been trying to address these issues. The Catholic hierarchy's
failure to address the spiritual causes of poor economic conditions
will ensure the pain and suffering of millions of Enriques for many
years to come.</LD>

<LD>Thanks for finally tackling the question of noise, even if it's New
York's noise (Oct. 13). Perhaps now someone will build a defense
against the deafening decibel level of our movie theater soundtracks.
When I took my 4-year-old grandson to his first film, as soon as the
sound came on, he ran out of the theater crying and holding his ears.
I know how he felt; many of us now take ear plugs to the movies. If
it's true that most movies are made to target the teen audience, then
why is the soundtrack geared for the hard of hearing? Or are our
teens already losing theirs?</LD>

unfavorably with Adolf Hitler. The artist, Aaron McGruder, is very
talented, and I would give my life for his and my right to freedom of
speech. Hitler, however, was a man who killed 6 million of my
ancestors, and to compare him to Bush isn't funny or true. McGruder

<HD>Small Districts' Views on Proposition 47</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "2 School Bonds Get Donations," Oct. 9: You are correct that
Proposition 47 has bipartisan support from educators, business
groups, taxpayers and parents. By helping to build some of the 46,000
classrooms we need to relieve overcrowding and repair older schools
we are investing in the infrastructure necessary to ensure a stronger
California.</LD>
<LD>   I want to make one critical correction, however. Your story
indicated some small districts were against the measure. California's
small school districts overwhelmingly support Proposition 47 because
it helps us reduce overcrowding and repair aging schools. As
executive director of the Small School Districts' Assn., I can
confirm that my members -- 500 districts strong -- believe
Proposition 47 will benefit their schools and kids immensely. Under
Proposition 47, every school district will receive its fair share.</LD>
<LD>   David L. Walrath</LD>
<TE>   Sacramento</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I agree that all school districts need money to fix old structures
and build new structures. The University of California, California
State University, the community colleges and local school districts
are overflowing with students from a growing population. But
historically, five school districts have received most of the K-12
state bond money over the last 15 years: San Francisco, Oakland,
Sacramento, Los Angeles and San Diego. Legislators prevent other
school districts from receiving their fair share. The voters have an
all-or-none choice. Vote no on Proposition 47. Ventura County voted
yes on a bond issue for its local community colleges. Voters should
be given a choice to vote separately on school bond issues and not
subsidize the interests of the politically powerful.</TE>

<LD>How interesting that Gerald Kamin's letter (Oct. 11) was printed the
day after the vote by Democrats and Republicans alike to grant
President Bush the unconstitutional power to launch a preemptive
strike against Iraq. When he blames Greens for Bush, Kamin doesn't
seem to remember that thousands of African Americans were illegally
purged from the voter rolls in Florida and that Al Gore did not even
inspire his own state of Tennessee to vote for him.</LD>
<LD>   Regarding Sen. Paul Wellstone: Ralph Nader, Winona LaDuke, I and
many Greens I know are ardent supporters of Wellstone. But we are a
political party. We will run candidates. In the last two years the
Green Party is the only national political party in the U.S. to gain
registered members. And 152 Greens hold local office throughout the
U.S.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kamin writes that the Green Party is "a cancer on progressive
politics." I submit that the Greens are the lead party for
progressive politics and that the Democratic Party is the cancer.
While claiming progressive thought and being somewhat better than
Republicans, the Democrats too often bow to lobbyists and their
money. Greens are a solution; it's the Democrats who are the problem.</TE>

<LD>Re "Reader Offers a Sound Idea for Governor's Race," by George
Skelton, Oct. 14: If we are going to assume that the gubernatorial
contest is over, then why not pay some attention to the other
statewide races? Californians could make significant reform by voting
for change in the lieutenant governor's office. Sen. Bruce McPherson
(R-Santa Cruz) has fought for public safety, worked to improve our
schools and striven to bring back fiscal sanity. Republicans have a
winner in McPherson. His campaign could bring much-needed balance
back to Sacramento.</LD>

<HD>Airport Spreads Its Wings</HD>
<DH>Van Nuys facility welcomes back public with shows of
vintage planes this weekend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Caitlin Liu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Promising to give children a history lesson and take old-timers down
memory lane, military aircraft from World War II will be on display
at two free shows this weekend at Van Nuys Airport.</LD>
<LD>   The first show, part of the Freedom Tour national exhibition, will
run Friday, Sunday and Monday. It will feature a rare B-17 Flying
Fortress, along with 10 other vintage aircraft. The second show, an
airport open house Saturday, will include all the planes from the
Freedom Tour plus about 20 other aircraft.</LD>
<LD>   The airport suspended its public tour program and its popular
annual air show after Sept. 11 because of security concerns,
financial difficulties and a lack of support from the military,
spokeswoman Stacy Geere said. But officials recently resumed group
tours and have scheduled an air show for next June to celebrate the
airport's 75th anniversary and the centennial of the Wright brothers'
first flight.</LD>
<TE>   Saturday's open house, sponsored by Los Angeles World Airports,
will kick off with a flyover of vintage AT-6 Texans, which were used
to train fighter pilots during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   The B-17 is the featured attraction of the Freedom Tour. The
exterior of the plane can be viewed for free, but visitors must pay
$5 per person or $10 per family to tour the interior. A half-hour
ride on the plane costs $395 per passenger, said Elliot L. Sanders,
president of the Van Nuys Propeller Aircraft Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an incredibly beautiful aircraft," said Sanders, who is also
an event coordinator for the bomber's owner, the Experimental
Aircraft Assn.'s Aviation Foundation based in Oshkosh, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   Other aircraft on display at the Freedom Tour include a B-25
Mitchell bomber, two P-51 Mustangs, a BT-13 Vultee trainer, a
single-engine Navion and a home-built Cirrus VK-30, Sanders said.</TE>
<TE>   The Freedom Tour will start at 8 a.m. each day and end at 5:30
p.m. on Friday, 6 p.m. on Sunday and noon on Monday at the Synchro
facilities at 7701 Woodley Ave.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's open house will be from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at 8030
Balboa Blvd. Free parking and shuttle bus service will be provided
from remote parking lots at Birmingham and Monroe high schools and
Cal State Northridge.</TE>

<HD>Man Jailed in Threat Against Times Writer</HD>
<DH>The suspect is accused of threatening a reporter working on
a story about an alleged extortion plot against actor Steven Seagal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Marosi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A West Los Angeles man was charged Wednesday with threatening a Los
Angeles Times reporter working on a story about an alleged Mafia
extortion plot against actor Steven Seagal.</LD>
<LD>   Alexander Proctor, 58, was being held without bail in a downtown
federal detention center after he was arrested outside his home.</LD>
<LD>   Proctor, authorities allege, broke the reporter's car window and
left a package containing a dead fish with a long-stemmed rose in its
mouth.</LD>
<TE>   A cardboard placard with the word "STOP" was affixed to her car,
parked near her Los Angeles home, according to the indictment by a
federal grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   The threats, authorities allege, were meant to intimidate Anita M.
Busch in an effort to stop her from reporting the story.</TE>
<TE>   "The only word he used was stop," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Daniel
Saunders, the lead prosecutor. "I think it's pretty clear."</TE>
<TE>   The incident occurred in June, a few weeks into Busch's reporting.
The Times published several stories that month about the arrest of
Seagal's former partner for his alleged role in a multimillion-dollar
extortion scheme against the actor by the Gambino crime family.</TE>
<TE>   A second reporter on the Seagal story, the author of a Vanity Fair
article, told police he was threatened at gunpoint outside his Los
Angeles home in late August.</TE>
<TE>   FBI spokeswoman Laura Bosley did not rule out the possibility of
more arrests.</TE>
<TE>   David Garcia, a spokesman for The Times, said the newspaper is
"very pleased with the announcement of today's arrest. The safety of
our reporter has always been our greatest concern."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors described Proctor as an ex-convict with burglary and
narcotics-related convictions. The organized-crime units of the FBI
and Los Angeles Police Department are continuing to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   Proctor, wearing wire-rim glasses and a black sweater, listened
attentively as he was denied bail by U.S. Magistrate Ralph Zarefsky.
The judge cited Proctor's criminal record and the nature of the
threats.</TE>
<TE>   Proctor is scheduled to be arraigned Monday morning. His attorney,
Victor Cannon, was not available for comment. If convicted of
violating the statute -- interference with commerce by threats of
violence -- he could be sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in prison.</TE>

<HD>Protesters Rally for Students Facing Discipline for Sit-In</HD>

<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>About 100 pro-Palestinian protesters at UC Berkeley took their case
to the steps of Sproul Plaza, rallying in support of 32 students
facing possible suspension for an April sit-in.</LD>
<LD>   Calling for "Free Speech, Free Palestine," speakers at the rally
Wednesday said the case recalls memories of the Free Speech Movement,
which began 38 years ago this month at Berkeley.</LD>
<LD>   "This is our university. It's our freedom of speech," said Chris
Cantor, a graduate student and member of the campus group Students
for Justice in Palestine.</LD>
<TE>   The Free Speech Movement was about students' right to conduct
political activity on campus. The current debate is over how far
students can go.</TE>
<TE>   The 32 students facing disciplinary hearings were among 79 people
arrested April 9 for taking over Berkeley's Wheeler Hall in a
demonstration demanding that the University of California system
divest from companies doing business with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors later dropped trespassing and other charges against
the protesters and a judge issued a factual finding of innocence. But
Berkeley administrators are going ahead with the hearings, saying
students broke school rules by disrupting classes.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the students face sanctions up to and including
suspension.</TE>

<HD>Mayors Play 'Can You Top This' in Friendly World Series
Wager</HD>
<DH>Hats become the main stakes as the executives of San
Francisco and Anaheim trade barbs in advance of baseball's Fall
Classic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kimi Yoshino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stylish San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown knew one thing for certain
about his World Series bet with Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly: The Mickey
Mouse ears were nonnegotiable.</LD>
<LD>   Before Daly could even complete his suggestion during a conference
call Wednesday to finalize their friendly wager, Brown "soundly and
completely" rejected the notion, bursting out: "Wait a minute. I'm
not wearing any mouse ears. Let's get that straight.... I don't want
to be photographed in mouse ears."</LD>
<LD>   Brown offered up something a bit more fashionable -- because, he
pointed out, he is "well known for wearing quality hats."</LD>
<TE>   If Anaheim wins, Brown said, he will sport a cowboy hat in honor
of Gene Autry, the Angels' original owner. If the Giants win, Daly
must don a black and orange fedora.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout their 10-minute conversation, the two mayors traded
lighthearted insults while holding court in front of chuckling
reporters gathered in each city.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, for example, said he's not much of a betting man. Instead,
he said, he's been relying on prayer to help tip the scales toward
the Giants in their quest for a World Series title.</TE>
<TE>   Daly, on the other hand, has become a bit of a gambling veteran
since the Angels made the playoffs, beating the mayors of New York
and Minneapolis with Anaheim victories.</TE>
<TE>   "I already know he's a sinner," Brown said about Daly's betting
habits. "I'm still fairly pure."</TE>
<TE>   Daly fired back, "You know, Mayor Brown, we have angels on our
side."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the heavenly magic has been working. Minneapolis Mayor
R.T. Rybak will be wearing an Angels jersey and Mickey Mouse ears at
the office Monday.</TE>
<TE>   And Daly is still waiting for a shipment of Nathan's hot dogs and
H&amp;H bagels from New York even though the Yankees were sent home
packing nearly two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It has not been sent yet," New York mayor Michael Bloomberg's
spokesman said, promising that they'd mail the bounty "today or
tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   To round out their World Series bet, Daly and Brown agreed that a
family from one area could get a free trip to the losing town.</TE>
<TE>   "San Francisco is so interesting and attractive, they might want
to stay," Brown said. "Don't blame me if you lose a couple votes."</TE>
<TE>   Brown later added that he would be around to "pay proper respects
when the Angels' wings are clipped."</TE>
<TE>   But it was Daly who got in the last word:</TE>
<TE>   "The bigger they are, the harder they fall."</TE>

<LD>   Ahomemade sign held by a cheering San Francisco Giants fan read:
"Ca. World Series. Deal Wi/It."</LD>
<LD>   The message was flashed by television from Pacific Bell Park to
baseball fans across America on Monday night. But it could just as
easily have been meant for California political candidates and their
strategists.</LD>
<TE>   A San Francisco-Anaheim World Series. Northern California vs. the
Southland. A major league distraction from politics that will not be
removed -- if the series lasts a full seven games -- until eight days
before the election.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the crowing and carping. And the victory parade.</TE>
<TE>   Deal with it, gurus!</TE>
<TE>   This Fall Classic will change the game plan of many candidates for
high office.</TE>
<TE>   The conventional wisdom -- although not every political pro
subscribes -- is that the California series will:</TE>
<TE>   * Help front-runners by denying trailing opponents the public
attention they need to catch up. Front-runners like Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "People only have X amount of attention they can pay to anything,"
says Democratic consultant Bill Carrick. "Work and family are the hot
things on the mind. 'Then what do I think about?'</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, I'm spending time on baseball. I'm reading about
the matchups between Giants and Angels players. I did that [Tuesday]
morning instead of reading about politics.</TE>
<TE>   "And I'm in the business. Can you imagine what real people do?"</TE>
<TE>   * Help well-heeled candidates -- like Davis -- by offering a huge
TV market in which to advertise. World Series time is very expensive:
$20,000 for a 30-second spot in L.A., $15,000 in San Francisco,
according to a political ad buyer.</TE>
<TE>   But "it's one of the best buys in politics," says Democratic
consultant Richie Ross. "If you want to reach male voters, it doesn't
get any better. It is spectacular.... You pay for what you get in
life."</TE>
<TE>   * Help incumbents -- Davis again -- by lifting the spirits of
voter-fans. Suddenly, as the election approaches, people feel
California may be headed in the right direction, after all, rather
than off on the wrong track.</TE>
<TE>   (In a recent Times poll, only 36% of likely voters thought the
state was going in the right direction; 53% said wrong track.)</TE>
<TE>   The warm glow of a World Series has helped past politicians
running for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   When the New York "Miracle Mets" upset the Baltimore Orioles to
win the 1969 World Series, embattled Mayor John Lindsay rode the
city's celebration back into office, many analysts theorized.</TE>
<TE>   This is how Mets outfielder Art Shamsky later summed up his
amazing team's effect on the public mood: "That was such a depressing
time in America. The Vietnam War was going on. New York had all kinds
of problems. We made people forget about that. We made people feel
good, not only in New York, but all over America."</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, unpopular Boston Mayor Kevin White was in a tough
reelection battle. Young council member Joseph Timilty was gaining
fast -- until the Red Sox got into the World Series against the
Cincinnati Reds.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox lost the series, four games to three, but it kept
Boston mesmerized for two weeks. There were three rain postponements
leading to what many consider the greatest World Series game ever
played -- won by the Red Sox, in Boston, on Carlton Fisk's all-time
highlight home run.</TE>
<TE>   White was reelected, recalls Timilty advisor Pat Caddell, because
"Boston got into the World Series, and the city stopped being angry.
People got excited and attention was diverted."</TE>
<TE>   But Caddell, who later became President Carter's pollster and now
lives in L.A., doubts this World Series will affect state political
races.</TE>
<TE>   A city gets hooked on its team more than an entire state does, he
notes. "Also, I don't think people are focused on the election
anyway. Why should they? There is no election here. There is no
democracy."</TE>
<TE>   Caddell is angry because Democratic and Republican leaders rigged
most congressional and legislative districts to ensure victory for
the incumbent party. Of 153 races this year, only eight, at most, are
truly competitive.</TE>
<TE>   But that's for another column. This one's about baseball.</TE>
<TE>   The World Series is a free extra base for the governor, if he can
avoid reckless running:</TE>
<TE>   * No airing ugly attack ads and irritating comfy fans while
they're enjoying baseball.</TE>
<TE>   * No throwing out a first pitch and getting showered with boos.</TE>
<TE>   * No claiming credit for an all-California World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Just relish the moment.</TE>
<TE>   For most of us, sports is a God-given, temporary escape from the
real rigors of life. Now, baseball will permit us to escape political
dirtball. For a while, we can focus on the Giants and Angels, rather
than the candidates' nasty pitches.</TE>
<TE>   The politicians can deal with it by thinking positive, like the
fans.</TE>

<HD>Teen Convicted of Murder in Beating Death of Transient</HD>
<DH>Jury finds that the attack on the homeless man as he lay in
a sleeping bag near the beach in Ventura was premeditated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oak View teenager was convicted of first-degree murder and robbery
Wednesday after a jury found that he deliberately beat and kicked a
homeless man to death last year, after stealing the transient's few
possessions.</LD>
<LD>   After four days of deliberation, jurors rejected defense arguments
that 19-year-old Robert Coffman never intended to kill homeless Army
veteran James Clark, 58, when he and three other teenagers assaulted
the man as he lay in a sleeping bag near the beach in Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorneys conceded that Coffman participated in the
attack. But they argued that the evidence of premeditation was weak
and urged jurors to find Coffman guilty of second-degree murder,
which carries a lesser sentence.</LD>
<TE>   One female juror dabbed tears from her eyes as Superior Court
Judge Ken Riley read the verdicts. The panel of five men and seven
women left the courthouse under police escort and declined to talk
about the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they did the right thing," said Tom Clark, the victim's
nephew. "This didn't just happen. [Coffman] purposely did this."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Stacy Ratner said the jury ultimately adopted her
theory of the case, but worked hard for days before reaching a
consensus. Jurors asked questions and requested that the testimony of
several witnesses be read back.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to murder and robbery, Coffman was found guilty of
attempted murder in connection with the stabbing of 19-year-old
Daniel McGrath at the Ventura beachfront promenade a day after
Clark's slaying on June 30, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The jury also returned special findings that Coffman used a knife
and inflicted great bodily injury in the McGrath attack. According to
court testimony, the victim was walking with his ex-girlfriend when
three teenagers, including Coffman, confronted him and started a
fight. McGrath was stabbed five times in the chest, arm and back.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very brutal situation," he said Wednesday, standing
outside the courtroom after the verdicts were announced. Coffman
"deserves the time."</TE>
<TE>   The defendant, a tall, dark-haired young man whom prosecutors
portrayed as a violent white supremacist, faces a life prison term
when sentenced Nov. 15.</TE>
<TE>   Coffman showed no emotion and stared straight ahead as the
verdicts were read.</TE>
<TE>   His mother wept and cried out, "Robert, I love you!" as he was led
to a holding cell.</TE>
<TE>   Coffman remains jailed without bail.</TE>
<TE>   As he left the courthouse, defense attorney James Farley said his
client knows that his actions were wrong and is remorseful. The
teenager will not be eligible for parole until age 59.</TE>
<TE>   The slaying of Clark occurred after a group of teens stumbled over
the sleeping transient as they headed to a beach party. The teens
allegedly stole Clark's backpack and a jar of pennies, then kicked
and stoned him. According to testimony, Coffman told friends that he
later returned and kicked the injured man a second time.</TE>
<TE>   Clark died after suffering blunt-force injuries, including a
crushed kidney, a broken rib and a possible skull fracture.</TE>
<TE>   Police later arrested Coffman, Rocky Mattley, Timothy Becker and
Christopher Dunham. During police interviews, Coffman admitted
kicking "a bum."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County prosecutors charged all four suspects with murder
but decided to prosecute Mattley in Juvenile Court because he was 14
at the time of the slaying. Mattley was convicted of second-degree
murder and is serving time in the California Youth Authority.Becker
and Dunham, both 19 and of Ventura, are awaiting trial.</TE>

<HD>Keene Curtis, 79; Stage Actor Famed for Role in 'Cheers'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Keene Curtis, a veteran Broadway, television and film actor who won a
Tony Award for his role in "The Rothschilds," played Daddy Warbucks
in "Annie" on Broadway and was the snippy upstairs restaurant owner
on "Cheers," has died. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Curtis died Sunday from complications of Alzheimer's disease at a
retirement center in Bountiful, Utah.</LD>
<LD>   Curtis won his Tony Award in 1971 as best featured actor in a
musical for playing four diverse characters, each with a different
accent, in "The Rothschilds."</LD>
<TE>   He won a Drama-Logue Award as Daddy Warbucks in "Annie," which he
played on Broadway, in San Francisco and in Los Angeles. He also
co-starred in the national company of "La Cage aux Folles" for two
years.</TE>
<TE>   On Broadway, Curtis also appeared in "A Patriot for Me," "Division
Street," "Night Watch" and "Via Galactica."</TE>
<TE>   A charter member of the Assn. of Producing Artists in 1960, he was
associated with the APA-Phoenix Repertory Company for nine years. He
appeared frequently on Los Angeles stages, including in "Saint Joan,"
"Ring Around the Moon" and "Black Comedy" at the Ahmanson Theater;
"Comedians," "Twelfth Night, "Chekhov in Yalta" and "Division Street"
at the Mark Taper Forum; and "The Cocktail Hour" at the Doolittle
Theater in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to playing the prickly restaurant owner John Allen
Hill on "Cheers," his numerous television credits include appearances
on "MASH," "Touched by an Angel, "Caroline in the City" and "E.R."</TE>
<TE>   He appeared in a number of movies, including "Heaven Can Wait,"
"American Hot Wax" and "Richie Rich's Christmas Wish."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Salt Lake City in 1923, Curtis grew up in Bountiful in a
family that loved theater. His railroad-man father built his
2-year-old son a miniature stage out of an old chiffonier, using a
towel for a curtain. Curtis later made his own little theater out of
cardboard boxes and put on shows for the neighborhood kids.</TE>
<TE>   He received bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of
Utah, where he was a student actor and cheerleader.</TE>
<TE>   He had returned to college after spending three years in the Navy,
and was discovered by Orson Welles in 1947, when Welles directed a
production of Shakespeare's "Macbeth" at Kingsbury Hall on campus.
Welles cast Curtis in the role of Lennox in his 1948 version of the
play, which launched Curtis' career.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis spent 12 years as a stage manager, beginning in 1949 as an
assistant stage manager on a tour of the Martha Graham Dance Company,
and later for Katharine Cornell and Guthrie McClintock.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Curtis endowed a scholarship at the University of Utah to
help graduates of the school's Actor Training Program launch their
careers. He also donated to the university his Tony Award and 48
boxes of theater memorabilia and personal papers, including a 1961
letter from Noel Coward, who praised Curtis' "firmness, patience,
efficiency and most of all your ability to handle people with tact
and imagination."</TE>
<TE>   Curtis is survived by his sister-in-law, nieces and nephews.</TE>
<TE>   Donations may be made to the Keene H. Curtis Charitable
Foundation, which supports scholarships at the University of Utah
theater department and other charitable causes. The contact is Joal
Curtis, 4720 N. Porsche Way, Boise, ID 83713.</TE>

<HD>Energy Trader to Admit Fraud</HD>
<DH>Former high-ranking Enron official is expected to plead
guilty to a conspiracy count.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The head of Enron Corp.'s energy trading operation in the West has
reportedly agreed to plead guilty today to a criminal charge for his
role in manipulating electricity prices in California.</LD>
<LD>   Law enforcement sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told
Associated Press that Timothy Belden, the former chief of Enron's
Portland, Ore., trading office, will plead guilty to a single charge
of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Neither Belden nor his attorneys, Paul Meltzer of Santa Cruz or
Julie Salamon of Emeryville, could be reached for comment late
Wednesday. Belden and other traders were said to be trying to reach
an agreement with prosecutors in exchange for testimony.</LD>
<TE>   Belden, who allegedly dreamed up some of Enron's trading
techniques with names such as Fat Boy and Death Star, would be the
third Enron official to face criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer, was
charged Oct. 2 with fraud, money laundering and conspiracy in
connection with the vast web of off-the-books partnerships used to
hide Enron's debt. In August, Fastow aide Michael Kopper pleaded
guilty to money laundering and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "We have long suspected that Tim Belden was the mastermind of the
strategies described in the Enron memos," said Chris Schreiber, chief
investigator with the state Senate select committee to investigate
manipulation of California's electricity market, referring to
internal Enron documents released by federal regulators in May.
"That's been our suspicion even before the Enron memos even broke on
the radar screen."</TE>
<TE>   "We knew that much of the manipulation in the market had to be
taking place by the traders and given that," Schreiber said, "we knew
Enron was a big player here."</TE>
<TE>   "Once the memos broke it confirmed our suspicions that Tim Belden
was one of the big players. Of course the documents we've uncovered
since confirmed that he was the mastermind."</TE>
<TE>   Schreiber said he believes prosecutors are hoping Belden helps
them convict top Enron executives. "I think they're going to try to
use Belden to get back to Houston," said Schreiber, "and by Houston I
mean Jeff Skilling and Ken Lay."</TE>
<TE>   Belden had moved to Houston to work for UBS Warburg, which bought
Enron's trading operations in January. But Belden, who got a
$5.5-billion retention bonus shortly before Enron filed for
bankruptcy-court protection, left UBS on Oct. 1 to return to
Portland.</TE>

<HD>Davis Is Halting Attack Ads as Campaign Enters Final Weeks</HD>
<DH>Advisors are confident of his lead. Observers say
negativity on both sides may be alienating voters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Matea Gold</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an abrupt shift in strategy, Gov. Gray Davis is pulling all his
television commercials attacking challenger Bill Simon Jr. off the
air and plans to run only positive ones in the remaining weeks of the
race.</LD>
<LD>   Davis' advisors said they are making the change -- an early if
traditional pivot at the end of a hard-fought campaign -- because
they are confident in their lead over the Republican nominee.</LD>
<LD>   Simon has struggled to gain traction since the March primary, only
to be set back repeatedly by missteps in his campaign, including a
false charge last week that he had evidence of illegal Davis
fund-raising.</LD>
<TE>   "We think we've reached a point in the campaign where Simon has
utterly failed to make his case," said Davis campaign strategist
Garry South in confirming the switch. "Most voters have turned away
from him, and they're waiting to hear from the governor."</TE>
<TE>   But the move comes at the end of what many political experts say
has been an exceedingly negative election season that has left many
voters with bitter feelings about both candidates. A recent Los
Angeles Times poll found that almost two-thirds of voters are
dissatisfied with their choices, and many predict that could lead to
one of the lowest voter turnouts ever seen in California.</TE>
<TE>   "When both campaigns are telling you the other guy is a sleazebag,
there's not a lot of reason to go vote," said David Provost, a
professor of political science at Cal State Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   Some said Davis is switching tactics at least in part because he
too has suffered from the relentlessly negative tone of his ads.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's dawning on even [Davis'] top people that that has
been a mistake, because there's no enthusiasm for Gray Davis," said
Tony Quinn, co-editor of the nonpartisan California Target Book.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their ideological differences, both Davis and Simon have
made a remarkably similar pitch to voters: The other guy is worse
than I am.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has called Simon a right-wing extremist and incompetent
businessman who is not fit to run the country's most populous state.
Simon has said Davis is a failed governor and accused him of trading
state policy for political donations.</TE>
<TE>   The mutual derision has dominated their television advertising and
political appearances. But they have said far less about why voters
should pick them to run the state.</TE>
<TE>   "I think both candidates still have a great deal of selling of
themselves left to do," Quinn said.</TE>
<TE>   The Times poll earlier this month was only the latest to
illustrate discontent among the state's voters.</TE>
<TE>   "They're both wretched," said Houston Wray, 51, a registered
Democrat who lives in the Bay Area city of Walnut Creek and was
surveyed by The Times. "They have nothing to offer."</TE>
<TE>   Wray, a welfare worker, said he is so dismayed by the lack of
solid proposals from either candidate that he is going to vote for
Peter Camejo, the Green Party nominee.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Robertson, 27, a magazine editor in Santa Barbara who is not
affiliated with a party, said he has been turned off by how Simon and
Davis have spent the bulk of their time tearing each other down.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so apparent that it's more of a professional game to both of
them, rather than how a person should approach public office, which
is offering ideas in the public's interest," said Robertson.</TE>
<TE>   The aggressive back-and-forth between Davis and Simon stems from
more than the usual acrimony that surfaces at the end of a long race.
With their ability to float new proposals hamstrung by the state's
financial problems, the two candidates have made concerted efforts to
focus on each other's weaknesses.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, Davis sought to put distance between himself
and his challengers by running a barrage of negative commercials,
starting in the Republican primary, when he took on former Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. The governor's television assault
against the moderate Republican helped Simon capture the GOP
nomination.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Davis turned his attention to Simon, and began a
hard-hitting series of commercials battering the investment manager's
business practices and the oversight of his charitable foundation.
More recently, the governor has run ads about Simon's stances on the
environment and abortion, calling him out of step with California.</TE>
<TE>   "Davis' entire campaign has been about making himself the lesser
of two evils," said GOP consultant Kevin Spillane. "Davis could have
been running against the Dalai Lama and he would have made him out to
be worse."</TE>
<TE>   To a lesser degree, Davis has aired commercials highlighting his
record on education, the environment and law enforcement. But the
governor has not laid out a plan of what he would do if reelected.</TE>
<TE>   South said voters are inherently skeptical of promises made during
a campaign, especially at a time when the state is struggling with a
budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "To put on commercials that have politicians promising the moon
and laying out grandiose schemes is not the way you win elections
anymore," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Because Davis is an incumbent, South added, voters can judge by
his first term what he would be like in a second.</TE>
<TE>   In a new commercial that will begin airing today, the governor
touts what he views as his achievements in improving education and
health insurance. And he says there is more work left to do.</TE>
<TE>   "You may not agree with everything I've done, but I'm working hard
to do what's best for California," Davis says, offering no other
details.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Simon has offered some proposals for reforming
schools and spurring economic growth. But his policy platform has
been overshadowed by his consistent critique of Davis as a "pay to
play" governor. The challenger's ads, which have run far less often
than Davis', have focused extensively on what are portrayed as the
governor's shortcomings.</TE>
<TE>   "Elections against incumbent governors are referendums," Simon
campaign consultant Sal Russo told reporters in September. "The
primary issue is, 'Are you satisfied with Gray Davis' performance in
office, and do you want four more years?' "</TE>
<TE>   That philosophy has shaped Simon's message to voters.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis is a failed governor, and our people know that," Simon
told supporters during a recent stop in Corona. "People want an
alternative, and I'm an alternative because I have ideas."</TE>
<TE>   But some campaign experts said that message -- absent a discourse
on what those ideas are -- is not enough to persuade voters to reject
an incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't just vote against someone," said Democratic
consultant Gale Kaufman. "Challengers must give voters a reason to
vote against the incumbent and for them. Bill Simon has not given
anybody a good reason to vote for him."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, as he admitted he erred when he accused Davis of
illegal fund-raising, Simon called for a new tone in the race and a
focus on issues instead of attacks. "I want to do my level best to
raise the dialogue in the campaign," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His newfound resolve didn't last long. The next day, his campaign
began running new commercials denouncing Davis for his aggressive
fund-raising and handling of the state's energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "Had enough?" the spots ask. "Fire Gray Davis."</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Metal Recycler Dumped Oil Illegally, Civil Complaint
Alleges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State and local prosecutors have filed a civil complaint against an
Oxnard metal recycler, alleging that workers for years had illegally
dumped and burned motor oil at the plant perched on the edge of the
pristine Ormond Beach wetlands.</LD>
<LD>   The Ventura County district attorney's office and the state
attorney general accuse Halaco Engineering of violating California
law by adding used motor oil to scrap metal materials that were then
run through industrial washers and burned in the company's furnace.</LD>
<LD>   During the washing process, some oil was flushed into settling
ponds on Halaco's property, prosecutors allege. Oil also stuck to the
materials that were burned, raising concerns about air pollution,
they say.</LD>
<TE>   Although prosecutors say the company halted the practice shortly
after it was brought to the firm's attention in 2000, they want a
permanent injunction barring such disposals.</TE>
<TE>   They also are seeking to fine the company an undetermined amount
for its alleged past misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "Oil is a regulated waste under California law, and you just can't
dump it on the ground or burn it in a furnace," Deputy Dist. Atty.
Mitchell Disney said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney David Shemano, who is handling a bankruptcy
petition filed by Halaco this summer, said the company disputes that
there was ever anything illegal or improper about its motor oil
disposal.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Shemano said company officials agreed more than two years
ago to change practices to avoid a dispute with the district
attorney's office. He said Wednesday's action took him by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's important to point out that they are not alleging
that we are doing anything improper right now," Shemano said. "We are
looking forward to working with them to resolve their concerns as
quickly as we can."</TE>
<TE>   The civil action, which stemmed from a 1999 inspection by the
Oxnard Fire Department, is the latest in a series of regulatory and
legal tangles for Halaco.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the state's Regional Water Quality Control
Board ordered the metal recycler to stop the soupy discharges that
since 1970 have yielded a 40-foot-high slag heap.</TE>
<TE>   The discharges are to end by December, and the slag heap must be
removed within 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which has said it will have to spend more than $1
million to meet the agency's long list of technical requirements, has
filed for bankruptcy protection to be able to comply with the water
board's order.</TE>
<TE>   Halaco also has been sued by the Environmental Defense Center and
the citizens group ChannelKeeper. The lawsuit accuses Halaco of
polluting the air and nearby wetlands.</TE>

<HD>Valley Horse Owners Ask Council to Help Preserve Their
Rights</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Wendy Thermos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're not a horse owner, the sight of a 1,000-pound animal in
your neighbor's yard, creating dust and manure, may be upsetting.</LD>
<LD>   But if you live in an equine-zoned area of Los Angeles and have a
horse on your property, you're not likely to be sympathetic to your
neighbor's complaints.</LD>
<LD>   The conflict has sparked an angry uprising among equestrian
property owners in the San Fernando Valley who feel city
horse-keeping laws are so restrictive and contradictory that their
rural way of life is in danger of vanishing from Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   About 250 horse owners spent more than three hours Tuesday night
telling a City Council committee that their rights are being eroded
by developers who buy up lots in their neighborhoods to build houses
for people who object to barnyard creatures.</TE>
<TE>   They received support for their cause from Councilwoman Wendy
Greuel, who, as a member of the planning and land-use committee,
requested the hearing held in Tujunga.</TE>
<TE>   "The current regulatory structure is a threat to horse-keeping
rights," she said Wednesday. "If someone doesn't have a horse for a
year, under current regulations they can lose the right to have
horses permanently."</TE>
<TE>   Bart Paul, a horse owner and Lake View Terrace resident for 22
years, said government regulations are a nightmare for horse property
owners, who live mainly in Chatsworth, Shadow Hills, Tujunga and the
Hansen Dam area.</TE>
<TE>   "If you ask how far you have to keep your horse from a dwelling,
the animal control department might say one thing, building and
safety might say something else, and the health department might say,
'We trump everyone,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said she will ask the full council next week to back her
plan for a land-use permit to preserve horse-keeping rights.</TE>
<TE>   In equestrian-zoned areas, property owners who don't keep horses
have put landscaping across horse trails. "We need to take
enforcement action there," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel wants the distance required between horses and dwellings to
be standardized, and will also seek a requirement that horse rights
be recorded with deeds and disclosed when property changes hands.</TE>
<TE>   Horse owners said they belatedly have learned that if they don't
license their animals with the city's Department of Animal
Regulation, their property technically doesn't have a horse on it.
Planning Department officials can then issue permits to build on
adjacent lots, and owners of equestrian-zoned parcels are barred from
having stock animals because of nearby dwellings.</TE>
<TE>   Paul said many horse owners don't get licenses because they fear
scrutiny from city building inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   "There are thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of horses in the
Valley," he said. "The city believes there are only a few hundred."</TE>

<HD>Poll Takes Steam Out of Tight Race for Valley Mayor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the election less than three weeks away, candidates for mayor of
a proposed San Fernando Valley city are struggling to capture the
voters' attention, and some say the fading prospects of secession
itself will make it difficult for them to raise money and enlist
volunteers for the homestretch.</LD>
<LD>   A new Los Angeles Times Poll found that more than two-thirds of
likely Valley voters were still undecided about which of the 10
mayoral candidates to support. Assemblyman Keith Richman
(R-Northridge) led the field, with the backing of just 13% of those
surveyed.</LD>
<LD>   And while the poll results gave hope to the other candidates that
the election is anyone's to win, they also were seen as a grim
indication that voters have little interest in the race, perhaps
because the Valley mayor's office will not exist if secession loses.</LD>
<TE>   The Times Poll found Valley secession was losing by a 2-1 margin
citywide and trailing narrowly in the Valley. To win, the Nov. 5
breakup measure must receive a majority of the votes in the Valley
and Los Angeles as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm losing confidence," said mayoral candidate Leonard Shapiro.
"This thing will win big in the Valley, but it will lose in the whole
city."</TE>
<TE>   The lackluster nature of the mayoral campaign was apparent
Wednesday when only five candidates showed up for a forum at the
Woodland Hills Chamber of Commerce, and most of the audience left
before they spoke.</TE>
<TE>   One of the candidates at the forum, insurance adjuster David
Hernandez Jr., who placed second in the poll with the support of 5%
of likely voters, tried to put a positive spin on the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, people are realizing that the most significant
thing since water in the San Fernando Valley is about to take place
in 20 days," said Hernandez, who is simultaneously campaigning for a
seat in Congress. "The sense of urgency and the pace has really
picked up. I think you'll have a lot more informed voters as we get
closer."</TE>
<TE>   Competing for a job that would pay $12,000 annually, the
candidates have stumped across the Valley, and some are preparing to
air commercials on local cable television and radio stations in the
next week.</TE>
<TE>   "This race is wide open," said Mel Wilson, a Realtor who placed
fifth in the poll, with 2%, despite endorsements from the Southern
California Assn. of Realtors and other organizations. Wilson had
raised $45,000 for the campaign, second to Richman's $127,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Fund-raising for this campaign, although I feel I'm doing well,
has been difficult compared to other campaigns," Richman said.
"Candidates are attempting to raise money for a position that may not
be in existence."</TE>
<TE>   The mayoral campaigns also have been hampered by the failure of
the central secession drive to generate the money, television
advertising, volunteers and public excitement that it originally
promised, said Tom Hogen-Esch, a political scientist at Cal State
Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the candidates are really dependent on the synergy of the
overall secession campaign to generate interest and help get their
message out," Hogen-Esch said. "If that campaign is dead in the
water, as it has been, those candidates have virtually no way of
getting their message out."</TE>
<TE>   While Richman has sent out hundreds of thousands of pieces of
mail, only Bruce Boyer, an alarm company manager, has a TV commercial
airing -- on cable television in the East Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "If Richman only gets 13%, that's fine with me," said Boyer, who
got 1% in the poll. "I figure the winner will need 25% to win, and
I'm the only one on television."</TE>
<TE>   Richman, a former city redevelopment commissioner, and Wilson, a
former city fire commissioner and Metropolitan Transportation Agency
board member, plan to begin running spots on Valley cable stations
next week.</TE>

<LD>Always searching for new thrills for my faithful readers, I followed
a tip from columnist David Allen of the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin
and checked the police logs of Cal Poly Pomona's student newspaper.
Sure enough, there was enough plot material for my projected TV
series, "Cops???":</LD>
<LD>   "A student's handicap placard was confiscated when the registered
party's date of birth was found to be 1928."</LD>
<LD>   "Suspicious circumstances were reported when a custodian was asked
by a nervous male in his 20s if he felt the earthquakes by the
vending machine in the library."</LD>
<TE>   "A couple was found making out and disturbing the peace in front
of Skywatch (security area) in parking lot F7."</TE>
<TE>   Wonder if that couple felt the earth move, too?</TE>
<TE>   It's that time of the year: Dan Fetterly of Van Nuys came upon
just the mansion for a Halloween party -- one built on pumpkins (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Unreal estate (cont.): Dorothy Brown of Bakersfield, meanwhile,
spotted a house for that really big cat of yours. Of course, if the
beast proves to be more house-breaking than house-broken, you can
always move it into the enclosure that Billie Pearson of Pacific
Palisades saw for sale (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   More creature discomforts: In the wilds of London, Jackson Sleet
of L.A. observed a crocodile notice (see photo). Actually the
"plates" are used in such areas as parking lots; in America, we call
them tire spikes. I still remember the excitement that spread over
the lunch court in my high school days when we heard about a
classmate who had vowed to back his car over a set of those spikes to
test the "puncture" warning. Poor fellow learned that it was an
example of truth in advertising.</TE>
<TE>   This really didn't hurt a bit: "I work for the state's Department
of Managed Health Care (we regulate HMOs) in downtown L.A.," wrote
David Link. "We had received fliers that the department would arrange
for a nurse to come to our offices and provide us with flu shots for
a fairly small fee. "Posters were up by the elevators, directing
people to the immunization room -- which was empty. The nurse failed
to show.... The thought of a group of health-care regulators lining
up for a no-show nurse struck me as somewhere between ironic and
ludicrous."</TE>
<TE>   Link added: "No, the nurse was not employed by an HMO."</TE>
<TE>   Pick your color: Writer Hank Rosenfeld noticed this movie marquee
in Santa Monica: BROWN SUGAR RED DRAGON WHITE OLEANDER. Commented
Rosenfeld: "It sounded like a page off a Chinese menu."</TE>
<TE>   Or selections from a catalog of house paint colors.</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: In the Long Beach Reporter newspaper, Lawrence Schorr
recommended that if a telemarketer calls and asks, "How are you
today?" you should respond, "I'm so glad you asked because nobody
these days seems to care, and I have all these problems: My arthritis
is acting up; my eyelashes are sore; my dog just died ..."</TE>

<HD>Sidney Pink, 86; Pioneer of 3-D Genre Produced More Than 50
Movies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sidney Pink, a movie producer who helped pry filmgoers away from
their television sets in the early 1950s with the first 3-D
feature-length movie, "Bwana Devil," has died. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Pink, who produced more than 50 films, including the science
fiction cult movie "The Angry Red Planet" in the years after "Bwana
Devil," died Saturday at his home in Pompano Beach, Fla., after a
long illness.</LD>
<LD>   "A lion in your lap." "A lover in your arms!" Those were the
promotional tag lines for "Bwana Devil," the groundbreaking 1952 film
on which Pink served as associate producer with Arch Oboler, the
movie's producer, writer and director.</LD>
<TE>   The story of British railway workers in Kenya falling prey to two
man-eating lions, "Bwana Devil" starred Robert Stack as Bob Hayward,
the head engineer bent on killing the lions before they feast on his
entire crew.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't very happy with the results of the film itself, but it
was not too bad considering, and the story was good," Pink's wife,
Marian, told The Times on Wednesday. She said that the box office for
the movie, which required audience members to wear cardboard 3-D
glasses, "was very good."</TE>
<TE>   "Lions were jumping into your laps, spears were flying and people
were coming toward you in hordes," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said her husband was proud to be connected with the first 3-D
movie.</TE>
<TE>   Stack also takes pride in having starred in the pioneer 3-D
production, which was shot in Hollywood with two monstrous cameras
with polarized lenses, one for the left eye and one for the right.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a line 6 feet from both cameras which you were not
supposed to cross," Stack recalled Wednesday. "Otherwise, you'd wind
up with that portion of your anatomy projected over the first 10 rows
of the audience."</TE>
<TE>   Stack said no one involved with the film knew how audiences would
react to the 3-D technique.</TE>
<TE>   "Sidney Pink and Arch Oboler and all of us poor innocents were
involved in something that we didn't even know worked or not," Stack
said. "It was a very expensive process, and it took a lot of guts to
even do it."</TE>
<TE>   Stack recalled that everyone had their fingers crossed at the
first preview.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the titles, they had a train that made a long, circling turn
and then came directly to the camera," he said. "Well, when it came
directly to the camera, people began to scream and jumped out of
their seats and ran out of the theater. I remember one of the guys
saying, 'Son of a [gun], it really works.' "</TE>
<TE>   Stack said "Bwana Devil" was "enough of an eye catcher" to prompt
Jack Warner to come out with his own 3-D production at Warner Bros.
in 1953, "The House of Wax," starring Vincent Price.</TE>
<TE>   "He felt this was the coming thing," said Stack. "Of course, he
was not exactly a rocket scientist, and it wasn't the coming thing."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Pittsburgh in 1916, Pink graduated from the University of
Pittsburgh with a bachelor's degree in business administration. He
began his film career as a projectionist in a theater owned by his
wife's family.</TE>
<TE>   Moving to Hollywood in 1937, Pink was hired as production budget
manager for Grand National Pictures, where he worked on the Tex
Ritter musical western series. He later moved to Columbia and worked
as a budget manager on "Lost Horizon" and the Jack Holt action films.</TE>
<TE>   After a disagreement with volatile Columbia chief Harry Cohn, Pink
returned to the theater side of the business as the owner of a
circuit of theaters in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, he served in the Army Transportation Corps
and Special Services.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he imported foreign films and produced burlesque
shows in downtown Los Angeles with Lili St. Cyr, Joe De Rita and
other performers.</TE>
<TE>   He then linked up with Oboler for the production of two films,
"Five" and "The Twonky," before they made movie history with "Bwana
Devil."</TE>
<TE>   In 1959, Pink co-wrote and produced "The Angry Red Planet," the
tale of the first expedition to Mars. The sci-fi movie was filmed in
what was advertised as a "revolutionary" process called "Cinemagic,"
a printing-process technique that gave the Mars scenes a pink glow.</TE>
<TE>   The same year, Pink moved his operation to Denmark.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time it was very difficult to work in any of the
[Hollywood] studios because they had union problems and would not
accept an independent producer," Marian Pink said. "At that time,
they were called 'the runaway producers.' "</TE>
<TE>   While in Denmark, Pink produced and directed "Reptilicus," a 1962
movie deemed "cliche-ridden" by the critics, about a pre-historic
monster that comes back to life.</TE>
<TE>   Pink then moved to Madrid, where he produced films throughout the
remainder of the '60s in Spain, Italy, Germany and other countries in
English and other languages, including "The Castilian," starring
Cesar Romero; and one of the earliest spaghetti westerns, "Finger on
the Trigger," starring Rory Calhoun.</TE>
<TE>   Pink, who discovered Dustin Hoffman in an off-Broadway production,
cast him in "Madigan's Millions" as a U.S. Treasury agent sent to
Italy to recover money that had been stolen by a murdered gangster
played by Cesar Romero.</TE>
<TE>   Pink was based in Puerto Rico in the early 1970s and, after
returning to the United States in 1974, he owned movie theaters in
Puerto Rico and Florida.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Pink is survived by a son, Philip, of
Niceville, Fla.; a daughter, Helene Desloge of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.;
and four grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Caltrans Retreats on Criticism of Runoff Measures</HD>
<DH>In a court settlement, the agency will notify thousands
that it shouldn't have dismissed treatments as ineffective.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Settling court allegations that it tried to sabotage a major study of
ways to treat toxic highway runoff, Caltrans will track down and
notify thousands of people that the agency's public criticism of
storm-water control methods was premature.</LD>
<LD>   The giant transportation agency agreed it jumped the gun by
issuing reports and presentations at professional conferences that
described many treatment methods on state highways as ineffective and
prohibitively expensive.</LD>
<LD>   As part of the settlement, Caltrans will send clarification
notices to its own employees, consultants, university staffers who
deal with storm-water issues, publishers of a trade magazine and
those who attended national forums in which agency officials
criticized storm-water treatment.</LD>
<TE>   Contaminated water running off roads, farmland, industrial sites
and urban areas has emerged as an enormous source of pollution for
waterways and the ocean. Nationally, there are ongoing controversies
about how to control storm water and the cost of treating it.</TE>
<TE>   In May, two environmental groups charged in U.S. District Court
that Caltrans was conducting a propaganda campaign to discredit
court-ordered research on ways to filter polluted runoff from
roadways. The agency and environmental groups are studying 38 sites
in Southern California where pollution controls are being tested. A
report is due out early next year.</TE>
<TE>   The Natural Resources Defense Council and Santa Monica BayKeeper
alleged that Caltrans, instead of remaining neutral as required
during such research, spent millions of dollars to challenge an array
of controls designed to check contaminated runoff.</TE>
<TE>   Further, the groups contend that the cost of treatment might be
far less than Caltrans reports indicate.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe by either intention or omission there was a broad
effort or, at a minimum, the release of a lot of information by
Caltrans that confused people about the efficacy of storm-water
treatment," said David Beckman, an NRDC attorney in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's correct the record. People should withhold judgment until
the study is out."</TE>
<TE>   The settlement is the latest action in a 10-year-old lawsuit
brought by the NRDC and BayKeeper to force Caltrans to comply with
the federal Clean Water Act. Over the years, District Judge Edward
Rafeedie has repeatedly ordered Caltrans to obey the storm-water
requirements of the law.</TE>
<TE>   The orders include a five-year study of the costs and
effectiveness of various treatment techniques that filter highway
runoff. They include roadside strips of sand and vegetation,
detention basins, vaults of compost or minerals, and simple devices
to catch trash before it enters storm drains.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans attorneys deny the agency engaged in a conspiracy to
undermine the study, which has been described as one of the most
comprehensive looks at storm-water controls. They said NRDC and
BayKeeper wanted to stop public debate and prevent the release of
publicly funded research that challenged their views.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the settlement, Caltrans admitted no wrongdoing, but
agreed to issue potentially thousands of clarification notices and
establish a panel of storm-water experts to resolve future disputes
over the pending study out of court.</TE>
<TE>   "This will help us continue to build on a more positive working
relationship with NRDC and the environmental community," said Brent
Felker, chief engineer for Caltrans.</TE>
<TE>   "We worked hard on this agreement, and we have worked hard to
improve mobility and the environment in California. We don't get
enough credit for that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The notification will state that Caltrans' conclusions about the
outcome of the court-ordered study "are premature. Such conclusions
are still the subject of ongoing analysis and discussions between"
the NRDC and Caltrans.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the letter will state that analysis and conclusions about
how storm-water treatment devices will be used and whether Caltrans
should install them are not final.</TE>
<TE>   The NRDC contends that Caltrans publicized its in-house cost
estimates and criticized storm-water treatment at professional
gatherings in California, Minnesota, Nevada, Florida and Washington,
D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans officials said they hope the settlement will reduce the
conflict and tension that has marked more than a decade of court
battles with the NRDC and BayKeeper.</TE>

<LD>   The regulations let owners of large ranches fell up to 19 of the

<HD>Tire Accident Case Is Settled for $13 Million</HD>
<DH>Huntington Beach man suffered brain damage when the wheel
of a big rig flew across the freeway and crushed the cab of his
pickup.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Huntington Beach motorist who suffered severe brain damage when a
loose tire rocketed across the Santa Ana Freeway and collided with
his pickup truck will receive $13 million under a settlement reached
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Under the deal, trucking giant Allied Systems Ltd. and a tire
servicing firm accepted equal responsibility for the accident, which
left 39-year-old plaintiff Philip Dohrman legally blind, unemployable
and unable to drive.</LD>
<LD>   "It hit him like a bolt of lightning out of the sky," plaintiff's
attorney Daniel Callahan said. "There was nothing he could do about
it at all."</LD>
<TE>   The accident occurred Jan. 9, 2001, when the wheel of a tractor
trailer spun off its axle, sailed into oncoming traffic and crushed
the cab of Dohrman's truck. The collision occurred in the northbound
lane of the Santa Ana Freeway in Irvine, near Sand Canyon Avenue. The
nearly 200-pound tire had been fastened insecurely to the big rig,
which was hauling a load of new cars.</TE>
<TE>   Dohrman, represented by the Santa Ana law firm Callahan &amp; Blaine,
alleged in court papers that the driver of the big rig was never
trained to make regular checks of the vehicle's wheels and lug nuts.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiff said Allied Systems Ltd. had violated a number of
its own policies and state requirements for maintenance of its
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Among other shortcomings, Callahan said, the driver of the big rig
was never shown a company video explaining the need and procedures
for checking lug nuts, nor was he told to inspect the lug nuts.
Callahan said that service records showed the vehicle had not
undergone maintenance for 180 days, even though it is required to be
serviced every 90 days.</TE>
<TE>   However, Allied Systems lawyer Kevin Smith said that a contractor
working for Allied had over-tightened the lug nuts, cracking and
weakening them.</TE>
<TE>   When the tire dislodged from the tractor-trailer, a motorist
behind Dohrman witnessed the accident. The tire, which careened over
the highway divider, jumped 20 feet into the air before slamming into
the cab of Dohrman's truck. After crushing the cab, the tire bounced
100 feet into the air.</TE>
<TE>   Dohrman, who was joined in the suit by his wife, Julie, 31, was
rendered unconscious upon impact. When he awoke from a semi-coma,
doctors discovered that his vision had been badly reduced, his speech
impaired and his memory flawed.</TE>
<TE>   "If you tell him something, he cannot remember it 15 minutes
later," Callahan said. "He tries to compensate for it by taking
notes. He's entirely reliant on a notepad now."</TE>
<TE>   Dohrman, a former construction supervisor and volunteer
firefighter, was an avid bodybuilder, motorcyclist, and in-line
skater before the accident, Callahan said. Now, it is difficult for
him to walk. "He walks, but he's very unsteady," the lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Allied and the tire service firm were insured by Zurich Financial
and Lloyds of London, who will pay the settlement in installments.</TE>

<HD>Lack of O.C. Pump-Outs Blamed for Boat Sewage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County boaters may be illegally dumping raw sewage into the
ocean because the harbor pump-out stations designed to transport it
safely to shore are largely inoperable, according to a study released
by an environmental group this week.</LD>
<LD>   The report by Orange County Coastkeeper of Newport Beach warns of
the serious potential for environmental damage.</LD>
<LD>   "I've heard a number of other boaters in the harbor complain,"
said Roberta Jorgensen, a Coastkeeper board member who owns a 33-foot
power boat in Newport Harbor. "They just can't find [a pump-out
station] that works, so they go out and dump into the ocean."</LD>
<TE>   Coastal regulations prohibit the dumping of sewage within three
miles of shore.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Berchtold, a spokesman for the Santa Ana Regional Water
Quality Control Board, which oversees two of the county's three
harbors, said he hadn't seen the group's report and couldn't comment.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Honeybourne, chief of the Orange County Health Care Agency's
water quality section, said the county had set up a committee about
six months ago to examine problems related to the more than 30 harbor
pump-out stations. According to the survey -- conducted from June
through September during peak boating season -- only 44% of the
stations in Huntington Harbour were operational. Similarly, the
report said, about 69% of the Newport Harbor stations were
functioning.</TE>
<TE>   The report's authors assigned grades of F and D+ to the two
harbors, respectively. Dana Point Harbor -- overseen by the Regional
Water Quality Control Board's San Diego office -- earned a B, with
81.25% of stations functioning.</TE>

<HD>Rap Label Ex-Staffer Shot Down</HD>
<DH>He is the third associate of Death Row Records chief Marion
'Suge' Knight to be slain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jose Cardenas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Death Row Records employee was shot to death Wednesday as he
sat in his parked vehicle at Imperial Highway and Vermont Avenue,
police and music industry sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Henry Smith, 33, is the third associate of Death Row chief Marion
"Suge" Knight to be gunned down in recent years. Smith had worked as
a graphic artist for the record company, designing the firm's logo, a
hooded man in an electric chair.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Smith was waiting in his sports utility vehicle while
his girlfriend was using a pay phone about 2:30 p.m. when the
assailant walked up, leaned into the car and fired five or six shots.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses said the attacker, a man in his 20s, dropped his pistol,
calmly picked it up and then fled on a bicycle. The witnesses said
the girlfriend's infant was in the car but wasn't hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears to be a senseless, gang-related shooting," said
Officer Jason Lee, a Los Angeles police spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Death Row officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Last April, former Knight associate Alton McDonald, 37, was shot
to death as he pumped gas at a service station at Rosecrans and
Atlantic avenues. Sheriff's deputies said the shots were fired from a
pickup truck that drove away after the attack. No arrests have been
made.</TE>
<TE>   According to court records, McDonald was in Las Vegas with Knight
and rap star Tupac Shakur in 1996 when Shakur was slain and Knight
wounded in a drive-by shooting near the Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Just hours before Shakur was killed, he, Knight and McDonald had
been involved in a hotel lobby scuffle that was captured by the
hotel's surveillance cameras. Knight was jailed as a result of that
incident after a judge determined that the rap executive had violated
his probation on a previous assault conviction.</TE>

<HD>Simon Wasn't Gangbusters as Prosecutor</HD>
<DH>Court records belie the assertion that he played a key role
in tackling organized crime.</DH>
<SE>One in a series profiling Bill Simon Jr.</SE>
<AU>Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>   During the 1980s, the U.S. attorney's office in New York mounted a
huge legal assault on organized crime. Bill Simon Jr.'s campaign for
governor has marketed him as a pivotal figure in that effort.</LD>
<TE>   From the start, Simon has emphasized his role as a prosecutor, his
experience as a businessman and his charitable activities as the
three cornerstones of his candidacy. His campaign spots accent his
work with Rudolph W. Giuliani, who as the U.S. attorney in New York
was Simon's boss.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's campaign Web site emphasized that his work had
"facilitated the convictions of the heads of all five  New York crime
families -- and successfully diminished their infrastructure so they
no longer could function as a viable criminal enterprise." Simon made
a similar claim in a speech at the Richard Nixon Library &amp;
Birthplace.</TE>
<TE>   He was described at one rally as the man who "broke the back
of the Mafia." Giuliani has frequently heralded Simon's work in
organized crime cases, particularly his successes in seizing the
assets of mob families.</TE>
<TE>   Though no one has questioned that Simon was an earnest lawyer
during his tenure as an assistant U.S. attorney from 1985 to 1988,
records and interviews show that he was hardly the major crime-buster
that he has claimed: * Simon can recall trying only one criminal case
from start to finish -- the successful prosecution of a marijuana
dealer who received a two-year sentence.</TE>
<TE>   * Although Giuliani's office won a number of major organized crime
cases, the heads of all five Mafia families were not convicted in
Manhattan during his tenure. All five were indicted in 1985 in what
came to be known as "The Commission Case" -- the first federal
prosecution of Mafia chieftains for running a crime syndicate,
utilizing the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.</TE>
<TE>   But one of the lead defendants, Paul Castellano, who headed the
Gambino crime family, was gunned down in front of a Manhattan
steakhouse before the trial started. Another, Philip Rastelli, head
of the Bonanno family, was dropped from the case before testimony
began.</TE>
<TE>   And there is no evidence in the massive court record housed in a
federal archive in Missouri that Simon had any involvement in the
case. Among the tens of thousands of pages in 14 boxes of material
from the case, not one paper has Simon's name on it.</TE>
<TE>   * The Republican candidate was involved in an earlier, separate
effort to keep Rastelli, the head of the Bonanno organized crime
family, from getting out of prison after his parole was revoked. But
Simon lost that case in 1985, and during the process a judge ruled
that evidence he submitted was unreliable.</TE>
<TE>   * Records also show -- and Simon can recall -- only one instance
in which he actually seized the assets of a criminal. After another
federal prosecutor secured the conviction and a 30-year sentence for
drug dealer Philip Vasta, Simon was easily able to convince a judge
in a civil proceeding that the government should be able to keep $5.8
million of Vasta's cash that federal agents found along with 6
kilograms of heroin, 9 kilograms of cocaine and several weapons
during a January 1986 raid.</TE>
<TE>   * Simon has boasted in the campaign that he "took on corporate
wrongdoers," while a prosecutor, and Giuliani has said Simon went
after "the worst polluters." But when questioned, Simon could cite
only one civil case against an asbestos removal firm and just one
instance in which he indicted a corporation -- a Staten Island
construction company charged with using unsafe methods to remove
asbestos from a Sanitation Department garage in Manhattan. Simon left
the U.S. attorney's office before the criminal case went to trial.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Simon does not have a complete record of his cases, nor does the
U.S. attorney's office in New York. The Times researched his record
by interviewing Simon, his campaign aides and numerous former
colleagues from the U.S. attorney's office, as well as reviewing
records at the U.S. attorney's office in New York, the U.S. District
Court in New York, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York,
the federal archive in Lee's Summit, Mo., and a database assembled by
the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a Syracuse University
institute that compiles records on federal agencies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Simon speaks with near reverence about the terrific experience he
had at the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, the oldest in the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a great chapter for me and a real stimulus toward
being interested in additional public service," he said in an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Williams College in Massachusetts and
working on Wall Street, Simon enrolled at Boston College Law School.
After graduation, he spent three years at a small New York firm that
specialized in corporate work. There, he met Whitney North Seymour
Jr., the former U.S. attorney in Manhattan, who prompted him to seek
a job as a federal prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   Like other applicants, Simon had to agree to stay a minimum of
three years if he was hired. And, like other applicants, he was
personally interviewed by Giuliani, who had been appointed U.S.
attorney for the southern district of New York by President Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   Simon got an office on the fifth floor at 1 St. Andrew's Plaza,
next to the downtown Foley Square Courthouse. He was assigned to the
civil division, the smaller and less prestigious wing of the office.
Civil lawyers in the office have a dual role. They bring cases on
behalf of the government, such as suing a polluter, and defend cases
on behalf of the government, such as when an FBI agent is accused of
using excessive force.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he handled a wide range of civil cases, including
defending postal drivers who had been in auto accidents, and doctors
working at Veterans Affairs hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   One small case stuck out in Simon's memory. A federal postal
inspector was accused of assault when he tried to subdue a man who
was "creating a big disturbance" at a Harlem post office.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, whose mother came to watch him try the case, said he was
initially nervous about his adversary, who was representing himself.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very articulate. Our office had never lost a case like
this to a pro se [someone representing himself]," Simon recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "Then, two-thirds of the way through his argument, he says, 'I see
the moon outside is at a level where I am going to win this case.' At
that point, the case started going downhill for him. He started
putting on his evidence, and he called all my witnesses.... I moved
for a directed verdict and got it."</TE>
<TE>   Although Simon was in the civil division, he volunteered to work
on criminal cases and won the admiration of K. Chris Todd, who headed
the office's general crimes unit.</TE>
<TE>   'One of the Guys'</TE>
<TE>   One of the hallmarks of Giuliani's regime was an anti-drug
initiative called "Federal Days." Once a week, federal agents would
arrest people in small drug cases that normally would have been
handled by local officials. But a federal prosecution meant that the
defendant could get a much stiffer sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "Rudy wanted to put more teeth into law enforcement on 'crack' by
taking them federal," said Todd, who is now in private practice in
Washington. At the same time, however, there were not enough lawyers
in the criminal division to handle all the arraignments.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill helped us with that effort, even though he was in the civil
division," Todd said. "Bill was just one of the guys."</TE>
<TE>   Simon also won the admiration of the attorneys whose offices
adjoined his -- Susan Millington Campbell, now a corporate lawyer in
New York, and Bernard W. Bell, a former Supreme Court law clerk who
is a professor at Rutgers Law School.</TE>
<TE>   "He struck me then as being a very decent guy," said Bell, who
like Simon was in the civil division.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell, who headed the office's environmental division, said she
became -- and remains -- a friend of Simon. For that division, she
said, Simon filed one major civil case on behalf of the Environmental
Protection Agency. The suit alleged that Benjamin Kurzban and Son
Inc. had violated the federal Clean Air Act and EPA regulations on
asbestos removal, potentially endangering the health of people in two
Manhattan buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said it was one of the first cases filed under new federal
regulations governing removal of the dangerous substance. Eventually,
Kurzban, while denying liability, agreed to comply with the EPA
regulations and paid a $5,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Taking On the Mob</TE>
<TE>   However, it is not Simon's environmental work but his purported
connection with organized crime cases that the Republican candidate
and his backers have most often trumpeted. Particularly noteworthy is
the claim that he played an integral role in the commission case,
which sought to lock up the leaders of all five New York organized
crime families.</TE>
<TE>   Simon denied that his campaign made exaggerated claims. Still,
when asked about the way he was introduced at the campaign rally, he
readily conceded that "I did not break the back of the Mafia." He
attributed the description to over-exuberance on the part of a
supporter.</TE>
<TE>   But he also said that he was entitled to claim a role in the
commission prosecution because of work he did on another case
involving Bonanno crime family leader Rastelli, who was one of the
original defendants in the commission case.</TE>
<TE>   Rastelli, who had a long criminal record, was released on parole
in April 1983 after serving seven years of a 10-year federal term for
extortion and other charges.</TE>
<TE>   In August 1984, Rastelli was arrested on charges that he had
violated parole by associating with criminals. By that point,
government agents had been building the commission case for four
years.</TE>
<TE>   Rastelli filed a federal lawsuit Jan. 23, 1985, alleging that he
was being confined in violation of his constitutional rights.</TE>
<TE>   Simon joined the U.S. attorney's office less than three weeks
later, on Feb. 10, and was assigned to the case -- a high-profile
matter for a new lawyer. (The indictment in the massive commission
case was unsealed two weeks later.)</TE>
<TE>   The Rastelli parole case did not go well for Simon. Two federal
judges -- including one who gave up the case when he joined the
Reagan administration -- ruled against the government.</TE>
<TE>   After the first judge ruled in Rastelli's favor, the federal
parole board held a second hearing and added new charges. Relying on
a secretly taped telephone call, the government alleged that Rastelli
had asked two Mafia leaders, Anthony "Fat Tony" Salerno, the Genovese
family crime boss, and one of his key lieutenants, Matthew "Matty the
Horse" Ianniello, for permission to formally enroll some men as "made
members" in the Bonanno crime family.</TE>
<TE>   In the hearing, Simon, again citing the taped conversation, also
contended that Rastelli had told Lucchese family boss "Tony Ducks"
Corallo that he wanted "to be on the commission." The claim was
secondhand; Rastelli was not on the tape.</TE>
<TE>   In front of Edward Weinfeld, the second judge, Rastelli's attorney
challenged the parole board's reliance on a transcript of the taped
call.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Weinfeld ordered the government to produce the tape
and found it unintelligible. Simon said he reported that to Giuliani
and Michael Chertoff, the lead prosecutor in the commission case. "We
got the tape enhanced," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   During a hearing into the matter, there was a particularly sharp
exchange between the young prosecutor and the veteran jurist. Simon
told the court that during the hearing before the first judge, the
parole board had not had information about a meeting Rastelli had
with James Napoli, who allegedly was a member of an organized crime
family. Weinfeld said the board certainly did have the information
and told Simon his statement was "almost absurd."</TE>
<TE>   A month later, after listening to the tape a second time with
earphones, Weinfeld wrote that "with the exception of half a dozen
words scattered throughout the five-minute conversation, the tape is
utterly unintelligible and consists of blurred sounds and voices."</TE>
<TE>   Weinfeld's decision emphasized that an FBI agent -- and a
government witness -- who listened to the tape could identify only
one of three voices on it and failed to substantiate the allegations
about Rastelli in any other way. The judge concluded that the
government's case, presented by Simon, was "hearsay run riot" and
that Rastelli's right to due process of law had been violated.
Weinfeld ordered him released.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the huge commission case went to trial in September
1986, Rastelli had been dismissed from it because he was engaged in
another trial and because Weinfeld had found the evidence cited by
Simon unreliable. A month later, Rastelli was convicted on separate
labor racketeering charges by another U.S. attorney's office and got
a 12-year sentence. He died in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Simon lost Rastelli's suit, he said the work he did on
it showed that he was "part of the team" in the commission case and
therefore entitled to claim some credit for the successful
prosecution in it.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said the evidence the government attempted to use --
unsuccessfully -- in his Rastelli case showed that there was a
functioning Mafia commission. In fact, nearly five years before Simon
joined the U.S. attorney's office, 200 government agents had started
gathering mountains of evidence on the commission. Simon also said
other information uncovered in Rastelli's parole revocation
proceeding was used in the commission case, but he offered no
specifics.</TE>
<TE>   Chertoff, the lead commission prosecutor, and now the head of the
Justice Department's criminal division, declined to comment on
whether Simon did any work on the case, as did co-counsel John
Savarese, who is now in private practice in New York. John Gilmore
Childers, the third member of the prosecution trial team who said he
had known Simon since they went to Boston College Law School in the
early 1980s, said he was not offended at Simon's claim, but he could
not recall any work Simon did on the case.</TE>
<TE>   The defense lawyers who tried that case also said they have no
recollection of ever meeting Simon in or out of court.</TE>
<TE>   Rastelli's attorney, Stanley Teitler, said he was shocked that
Simon had taken credit for helping to "facilitate the convictions" of
Mafia leaders, particularly because the judge ruled the tape
inadmissible. "That's outrageous. 'Facilitate' is a weak word for a
guy who did a weak job," Teitler said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Garcia, who was a federal prosecutor in the Manhattan U.S.
attorney's office from 1983 to 1987, overlapping with Simon, also
scoffs at the Republican candidate's claim.</TE>
<TE>   "For Bill Simon to say he facilitated a conviction [in the
commission case] is meaningless," Garcia said. "It's not like he
brought those people in and urged them to plead guilty or seized
their assets," said Garcia, who is now a civil rights lawyer in Los
Angeles. "That's like claiming you got all A's if you got a B
average."</TE>
<TE>   After The Times asked about the Simon campaign's Web site
contention that he had "facilitated the convictions" of the five
Mafia families, the campaign toned down the language about his
crime-fighting record by deleting any reference to organized crime
cases.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said in an interview that he did not know why the language
had been altered. "I have not been involved in deciding what goes on
the Web site," he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, at a state Republican Party convention in late September,
after the Web site had been altered, Simon's team passed out campaign
literature contending that "Bill worked with then-U.S. Atty. Rudy
Giuliani to convict all five New York crime families. He is the only
candidate who has actually put criminals behind bars."</TE>
<TE>   Simon closed his tenure as a federal prosecutor with his sole
indictment of a corporation -- a Staten Island construction company
charged with using unsafe methods to remove asbestos from a
Sanitation Department garage in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   The January 1988 indictment charged DAR Construction and foreman
Maurice Dieyette with six counts of improper asbestos removal. Simon
aides said it was the first time criminal charges had been lodged
anywhere in the country based on improper asbestos removal.</TE>
<TE>   Less than two weeks after Simon secured the indictment, he left to
join his father and brother in business.</TE>
<TE>   He had spent three years and one day in government, a single day
over the three-year commitment he made when he joined the office.</TE>
<TE>   Another attorney took over the case. A year later, the corporation
pleaded guilty and paid a fine of $75,000.</TE>
<TE>   The foreman was convicted after a trial and got a 90-day jail
sentence and three years' probation.</TE>

<HD>Nurses Accuse Hospital of Stalling Union Approval</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karima Haynes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Registered nurses at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank
alleged Wednesday that hospital administrators are trying to prevent
them from organizing by delaying the certification of union election
results.</LD>
<LD>   The nurses went public with their assertion at a rally in front of
the hospital attended by television actors Mike Farrell of "M*A*S*H"
and "Providence" and Ellen Crawford of "ER.''</LD>
<LD>   Farrell said he had a personal connection to the hospital and its
nurses, who cared for his mother in the months before she died.</LD>
<TE>   "I have been to this hospital a number of times with my mother,
including a time when she broke her hip, and she was well cared for
by the people here," Farrell said.</TE>
<TE>   As first vice president of the Screen Actors Guild, Farrell said
he believes in the concept of collective bargaining and supported the
nurses' decision to form a union to meet their needs and those of
their patients.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford said she feels a certain solidarity with nurses because
she has spent time with so many in preparing for her role as nurse
Lydia Wright on "ER."</TE>
<TE>   "The public has to understand that when nurses are asking for
better working conditions, they are not talking about their personal
comfort but the conditions of patient care within the hospital," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of the hospital's 518 registered nurses voted Sept. 27
and 28 to join the Service Employees International Union, said Luisa
Blue, president of the union's Nurse Alliance of Southern California,
which represents 100,000 registered and licensed vocational nurses.</TE>
<TE>   "The working conditions are getting worse and we are forced to do
more with less," said Christine Terrones, a registered nurse who has
worked at the hospital for 17 years and is a member of the nurses'
leadership committee to establish a union.</TE>
<TE>   Registered nurses contend that hospital administrators have held
up certification of the election results with "frivolous challenges
and objections," including voter intimidation and ballots cast by
ineligible nurses.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital executives deny that they have sought to delay
certification of the election results. Of the 493 ballots cast, union
officials challenged 51 and the hospital questioned five.</TE>
<TE>   Blue said the union had enough votes without the challenged
ballots.</TE>
<TE>   The matter now goes before the National Labor Relations Board.</TE>

<HD>Milestone Water Accord OKd</HD>
<DH>Southland deal furthers shift of rural supplies to cities.
Agency boards must give final approval.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Vogel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California water officials agreed Wednesday to shift water
from desert farms to San Diego County, a costly and complicated
transfer aimed at averting a federal cutback next year of Colorado
River water used by millions of people from Ventura to the Mexican
border.</LD>
<LD>   The deal -- still subject to formal approval by four agency
boards, including the Imperial Irrigation District, which controls
most of the water involved -- marks a milestone in a trend to divert
water from rural, agricultural regions to expanding urban areas
across the West.</LD>
<LD>   "Times have changed. Urban interests are now knocking at the
door," said UCLA historian Norris Hundley Jr., who has written
several books about water in the American West.</LD>
<TE>   With deals like this one, Hundley said, "we are acknowledging a
new reality. When people, meaning cities, need water, they are going
to get priority. When there are cutbacks, farmers will be cut back
before cities."</TE>
<TE>   Final approval of the pact would also buy the state more time to
wean itself from a steady diet of water from the Colorado River to
which other states and Mexico have legal claims.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement, which is to last for up to 75 years, would pay
farmers in the Imperial and Palo Verde valleys not to grow crops.
Water transferred by existing canals from those valleys would give
San Diego County a major new source of water as well as long-sought
independence from the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement may represent a windfall for some farmers, but
others worry that by taking land out of production, the deal could
increase Imperial County's unemployment, which is already the highest
in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Under the deal, Imperial Valley farmers would fallow land over the
next 15 years and transfer up to 200,000 acre-feet per year, enough
water to meet about one-third of San Diego County's needs.</TE>
<TE>   The farmers would be paid $258 to $400 an acre-foot for water that
costs them $15.50 per acre-foot.</TE>
<TE>   To buy the water and pay for the social and economic costs of
idling farmland 100 miles away, San Diego expects to invest $2
billion.</TE>
<TE>   "Peace has broken out on the river," said Assemblyman Bob
Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) in a ceremony outside Imperial Irrigation
District offices in La Quinta.</TE>
<TE>   During the last month of his final session in the Legislature,
Hertzberg drove four days of nearly round-the-clock negotiations to
reach the multi-party agreement involving the Imperial Irrigation
District, the San Diego County Water Authority, the Coachella Valley
Water District and the MWD.</TE>
<TE>   The urgency was dictated by a Dec. 31 federal deadline for
California to show how it will reduce its dependence on water from
the Colorado River. For the last 29 years, the state has been using
more of the river's water than it was entitled to take.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest challenges facing urban water agencies such as
the MWD has been to persuade irrigation districts along the river,
who have rights to most of the state's share, to sell water secured
by their ancestors a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   "These are tough, tough fights," Hertzberg said, "but people were
fair, they were open and honest in this process, and it really is a
great day."</TE>
<TE>   The agreement must still be ratified by the boards of the four
agencies by the end of the year for California to avoid losing
Colorado River water sufficient to supply 1.6 million Southern
California families.</TE>
<TE>   Ratification is not certain.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the five-member Imperial Irrigation District board
expressed reservations.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Horne, one of the two, said he is reserving judgment until
valley residents scrutinize the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a settlement, and it's going to involve for us some benefits
and some sacrifices," he said. The valley produces $1 billion a year
of food and fiber with its share of Colorado River water. Some people
there fear that fallowing will cost jobs and shrink income as farmers
stop repairing equipment, buying seed and hiring field hands. Other
landowners see profits in water sales to faraway cities.</TE>
<TE>   At a maximum, Horne said, 30,000 acres of the 450,000 farmed in
the district could be fallowed.</TE>
<TE>   Imperial board member Stella Mendoza called that too much.</TE>
<TE>   "Once fallowing is allowed to occur, it will continue," she
testified at a legislative hearing shortly before weary negotiators
signed the agreement. "The unemployment rate is at 22%, and we cannot
afford the loss of any additional jobs."</TE>
<TE>   The agreement requires water officials to compensate farmers, who
use 80% of California's developed water supply, so the water can be
shifted to new subdivisions and office parks.</TE>
<TE>   Such transactions are still shadowed by the draining of Owens
Valley, a farming community east of the Sierra Nevada that dried up
when Los Angeles acquired most of its water supply in the 1920s. But
modern water deals are also driven by historical inequities that give
farmers enough water to flood orchards while factories ration water.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett Raley, assistant secretary for water at the U.S.
Department of Interior, called Wednesday's agreement a key solution
to water scarcity in the West. Although relatively new to California,
he said, such long-term negotiated transfers have shifted water for
decades in Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "We firmly believe that one of the answers to the challenges we
face with growth in the West is that there will be market-based
transfers from farms to municipalities," he said. "This is not rocket
science."</TE>
<TE>   Nor is it the first time the Imperial Irrigation District has
agreed to sell water to city dwellers. In the mid-1980s, accused of
wasteful irrigation practices by state regulators, Imperial arranged
to conserve and sell 100,000 acre-feet of water a year to the MWD.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, San Diego sought to make a similar transfer as a way to
reduce its dependence on the MWD, the region's chief wholesaler of
water.</TE>
<TE>   But a deal was complicated by disputes over how much San Diego
should pay the MWD for using its Colorado River canal and, more
recently, by feared harm to the environmental health of the Salton
Sea.</TE>
<TE>   The water that runs off Imperial Valley farms drains into the
Salton Sea.</TE>
<TE>   An artificial lake that is 30% saltier than the ocean, the sea
provides food for millions of migrating geese, ducks, pelicans and
other birds.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists fear that water transfers will dry up the runoff
that sustains the sea, making it too salty to support fish or birds.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement reached Wednesday requires that a water transfer
cause no significant increase in the sea's salinity for the next 15
years. To meet that demand, the Imperial Irrigation District will
have to agree to fallow land, rather than simply conserve water.
Fallowing frees up more water so that some of it can still make its
way to the Salton Sea.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, Imperial farmers are responsible for
sustaining flows to the sea for the first 15 years. Federal and state
officials hope that after that, they will have worked out a long-term
plan to protect the sea from becoming hyper-saline. Environmentalists
are apprehensive.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can incorporate protections for the Salton Sea for 15
years," said Tom Kirk, executive director of the Salton Sea
Authority, "why can't you do it for 75 years."</TE>
<TE>   He estimated that when water transfers hit a peak under the
agreement, the sea will lose 25% to 30% of its intake.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of the water to be transferred to San Diego will come from
Imperial Valley farmers. Some will be delivered by growers in the
neighboring Palo Verde Irrigation District who are close to
finalizing an agreement to fallow land and sell water to the MWD,
which has agreed to shift some of that water to San Diego. The Palo
Verde district is in the Blythe area.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego County Water Authority General Manager Maureen Stapleton
said the deal will not lead to an immediate rate increase, although
customers can expect to pay more over the next 10 years as water
becomes scarcer and the agency invests in conservation, desalination
and recycling.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement "increases our water reliability and it diversifies
our water portfolio," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a critically important step, but not the only step."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The Archdiocese of Boston must hand over internal records of 85
priests facing sex-abuse allegations, a judge ruled Wednesday,
rejecting a church request for more time to gather tens of thousands
of documents.</LD>
<LD>   Appeals Court Justice Kenneth Laurence ruled the same day church
officials appealed a 3-week-old order to produce the documents in a
civil case against retired priest Paul Shanley and the archdiocese.</LD>
<LD>   J. Owen Todd, Cardinal Bernard Law's attorney, said the
archdiocese will comply with the order. Roderick MacLeish, attorney
for Shanley's alleged victims, asked church officials to hand over
the documents by noon today, but Todd said that would be impossible.</LD>
<TE>   "There are 25,000 documents that have to be examined," Todd said.
"I don't think that even Mr. MacLeish believes we can meet this
deadline."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's ruling came a day after Superior Court Justice
Constance Sweeney chided archdiocese officials for stalling in the
case, delaying production of documents until after court-ordered
deadlines have passed.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese lawyers said they are cooperating but that plaintiffs'
attorneys are asking them to perform "superhuman" tasks.</TE>
<TE>   MacLeish said the archdiocese should hire more lawyers if it can't
keep up with court orders. "We're working every day too," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs hope to use the records to show the church had a
pattern of moving accused priests from parish to parish. Shanley is
in jail awaiting trial on child rape charges.</TE>
<TE>   MacLeish said the archdiocese has already given the same documents
to the attorney general, and that the church has told him it did not
make copies of the records. A spokeswoman for the attorney general's
office said the state has received documents from the archdiocese,
but would not say whether it had personnel files on all 85 priests.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, Law finished answering questions in pretrial
testimony for the Shanley case. His deposition took six days, spread

<HD>8 Face Charges in 1997 Rape, Murder of Connecticut Girl</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LITCHFIELD, Conn.</DL>
<LD>Seven people were arraigned Wednesday in what police say was an
orchestrated kidnapping, rape and murder of a 13-year-old girl by a
group of friends five years ago. An eighth suspect was arrested in
Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators believe the group spent several days plotting to
kill Maryann Measles after she accused two of them of rape, a source
familiar with the case said on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   Two of the seven face charges that could bring the death penalty.</LD>
<TE>   "I think they should die for what they did," said the victim's
mother, Cindi Measles. "But I think lethal injection is too easy."</TE>
<TE>   Court records were sealed and prosecutors and police declined to
comment on details of the case.</TE>
<TE>   "It was as horrendous and tragic and savage a crime as I've seen
in my 31 years as a prosecutor," prosecutor Frank Maco said.</TE>
<TE>   The girl's body was found in 1998 at a lake, wrapped in a blanket
and chains, nine months after she disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Cindi Measles said her daughter had told her she feared for her
life because she had made the rape allegations. Measles said she left
her daughter in the car in a parking lot and went shopping. She never
saw her again.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state investigation of a county jail where eight inmates died in a
fire uncovered major safety violations that have resulted in fines,
an official said.</LD>
<LD>   Mitchell County was fined $7,350 this month for violations of the
state's occupational safety code, Labor Department spokesman Allen
McNeely said.</LD>
<LD>   He said the county built a storage addition where the May 3 fire
is believed to have started out of combustible materials and failed
to properly install barriers and smoke detectors.</LD>
<TE>   McNeely noted the department can only levy relatively small fines
because its jurisdiction is limited to occupational safety. "That's
why the fine certainly doesn't seem worth eight lives," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. James Rusher, whose territory includes Mitchell
County, has not yet announced the results of his own investigation.</TE>

<LD>Holocaust victims and their heirs could soon see $275 million under
an agreement signed by an international commission established in
1998 to settle insurance claims with German and other European
companies.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement provides funds for claims, claims-related expenses
and humanitarian programs that benefit Holocaust survivors.</LD>
<LD>   Lawrence S. Eagleburger, a former secretary of State who chaired
the International Commission of Holocaust-Era Insurance Claims,
described the agreement he and three German representatives signed as
"a major step forward" for survivors and their heirs.</LD>
<TE>   "We have had our difficulties but today we have a new beginning
for people to pursue their valid claims," Eagleburger said in a
reference to two years of often contentious negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Israel Singer, chairman of the World Jewish Congress, which helped
negotiate the accord, said the settlement process now was moving
"from hope to implementation.... The German government stands behind
this agreement and that's what's changed."</TE>

<HD>Fate of Key Bills in Doubt as Congress Plans a Recess</HD>
<DH>Campaigning for Nov. 5 elections takes priority. Leaders of
both parties say the legislative work has ended, at least until the
lame-duck session.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Congress on Wednesday stumbled toward a recess that
could postpone -- and possibly kill -- a slew of major bills on
issues ranging from homeland security to energy policy to health
care.</LD>
<LD>   With lawmakers planning to reconvene after the Nov. 5 elections
for a lame-duck session, House leaders Wednesday night sent their
members home for the final weeks of the fall campaign. Senate leaders
are expected to follow suit, although they intend to keep the chamber
in session at least into next week.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders of both parties said that, with most major issues stymied
in partisan impasse, the productive work of this Congress has
effectively ended -- at least until the lame-duck session.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a steep climb" to get anything more passed before the
election, said Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.).</TE>
<TE>   Two major bills were sent to the White House on Wednesday, when
the Senate gave final approval to a measure to help states overhaul
their voting systems and a $355.1-billion defense appropriation bill.</TE>
<TE>   The defense bill increases the Pentagon's budget by $37.5 billion
-- the biggest boost since the Cold War. It provides $7.4 billion to
develop a national missile defense system, funds a 4.1% pay raise for
the military and backs the Defense Department's cancellation of the
$11-billion Crusader howitzer program.</TE>
<TE>   But as the preelection break came into view, lawmakers engaged in
a flurry of finger-pointing about which party is to blame for the big
backlog of business they are leaving unfinished.</TE>
<TE>   That includes President Bush's proposal -- unveiled in June -- to
create a Department of Homeland Security. The bill once seemed
politically unstoppable, but it now is mired in the Senate because of
a dispute over civil service rights for workers in the new agency.</TE>
<TE>   Senate leaders said they would continue to try to break the
impasse in the coming days. But some lawmakers fear that pushing the
bill into a lame-duck session jeopardizes its passage.</TE>
<TE>   Other issues left hanging are bills that would revamp federal
energy policy, create federal backup for insurance companies in the
event of another terrorist attack and boost Medicare payments to
doctors and hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the Republican-controlled House insisted they would
reconvene and return to work if, at any time before the elections,
the Democratic-controlled Senate broke its impasse over homeland
security or any other pending legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "We're on 24 hours' notice," said House Ways and Means Chairman
William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield). "If the Senate moves, we're back."</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats blamed House Republicans for the continuing
stalemates on many issues.</TE>
<TE>   "This Congress, at the direction of the Republican leadership of
the House, is walking away from its responsibility to deal with
virtually every domestic problem we have," said Rep. David R. Obey
(D-Wis.).</TE>
<TE>   The House cleared the way for leaving town by approving a bill,
228 to 172, that would keep the government financed through Nov. 22.
The Senate approved the measure by voice vote.</TE>
<TE>   The short-term funding is needed because Congress has approved
only two of the 13 appropriation bills needed to finance the
government in the current budget year, which began Oct. 1. Along with
the defense bill, the other spending measure sent to Bush provides
$10.5 billion for military construction projects.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, the House derailed a planned vote on a bill to
provide tax relief to people hurt by this year's stock market plunge.
Some Republicans wanted to push the measure, even though it was
destined to die in the Senate, to provide another show of GOP concern
for voters suffering from the shaky economy.</TE>
<TE>   But the bill ran into opposition from conservative Republicans,
who opposed provisions that would have made it harder for companies
and individuals to move overseas to escape U.S. taxes. And other
Republicans said it made no sense to push a bill that had no chance
of passing.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks too contrived to do it three weeks before the election,"
said Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert (R-N.Y.).</TE>

<LD>A woman who neighbors said tried to force drug dealers off her street

<LD>   It was the second fire to strike the corner row house in two

<LD>   The only survivor of Wednesday's fire was the woman's husband, who

from a second-floor window, fire officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators had not determined late Wednesday what caused the
2:30 a.m. fire.</TE>
<TE>   In the first fire, a "cocktail bomb" was thrown through the
kitchen window as the family slept, about the same time as
Wednesday's fire, neighbors said. The woman's husband woke in time to
put out the flames.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Gerlena Jackson said the woman killed, whom she
identified as Angela Dawson, had argued for weeks with a group of
teenage boys who hung out on the corner dealing drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "They had words, they had confrontations. She was threatened,"
Jackson said. "She was a concerned mother, just like us all."</TE>
<TE>   The family boarded the window after the first fire, but Dawson
didn't stop sparring with the teens, Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   The victims were found on the second and third floors and appeared
to have died of smoke inhalation and burns, fire department spokesman
Kevin Cartwright said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials did not immediately release their names. Neighbors and
principals at the children's schools identified those killed as
Carnell Dawson and Juan Ortiz, both fifth-graders; twins Kevin and
Keith Dawson, both third-graders; and LaWanda Ortiz, a
seventh-grader.</TE>
<TE>   Dawson's husband, Carnell Dawson Sr., was hospitalized in critical
condition.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Geraldine Lee, 59, said she saw flames coming out of the
windows of the brick row house about 3 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even see how the firemen could have gotten in that
house," Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms also is
investigating the fire's cause, Cartwright said.</TE>

<HD>Jeb Bush's Lead Shrinks as Race Is a Dead Heat</HD>
<DH>President to travel to Florida to help brother's reelection
bid against a virtual unknown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John-Thor Dahlburg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MIAMI -- Brother of one president, son of another, Republican Gov.
Jeb Bush is now in the political race of his life against a Democrat
who is still a little-known quantity to many Floridians.</LD>
<LD>   A poll conducted last week for MSNBC found Bush and his
challenger, Bill McBride, in a statistical dead heat. Bush had a lead
of 3 percentage points over McBride, according to the Zogby
International poll of 500 likely voters, but the spread may be
meaningless because the poll's margin of error is plus or minus 4.5
points.</LD>
<LD>   More worrisome for Bush, pollster John Zogby said in a television
interview, was that when asked if their governor deserved a second
term, only 45% of the Florida voters surveyed said yes, while 48%
said they preferred "someone new."</LD>
<TE>   Hanging onto Florida, which clinched the controversial 2000
election for Republicans with the nation's fourth-biggest trove of
electoral votes, is a crucial assignment for GOP strategists.
President Bush is scheduled today to make his 11th visit to the state
since taking office. He will speak at a school in New Smyrna Beach
about education, a hot-button issue in Florida, and attend a private
fund-raiser for his younger brother's reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   There will be other opinion polls before election day, Nov. 5, but
whatever their results, the gubernatorial contest is shaping up to be
close. "In Florida, everybody knows that one vote does make a
difference now," Jeb Bush told NBC's "Today" on Tuesday. "We've been
sensitized to that."</TE>
<TE>   In Zogby's previous Florida survey, conducted Sept. 21, Bush held
a 10-point advantage. So why has his margin melted away to be
statistically insignificant?</TE>
<TE>   "My interpretation of the election is that more or less it's a
referendum on Jeb Bush," said George Gonzalez, assistant professor of
political science at the University of Miami. "And the reason the
race is so tight is that a lot of people have negative feelings about
Jeb."</TE>
<TE>   Turmoil in the state's child welfare agency, local fallout from
the economic slump, dissatisfaction over public schools, rancor over
the disputed 2000 election and lingering hostility among minorities
because of the abolition of affirmative action programs--all have
helped sap Bush's popularity.</TE>
<TE>   This month, the 49-year-old governor was also caught on tape
making disparaging remarks about lesbians at what he thought was a
private meeting in the conservative Panhandle, and vowing to use
"devious" countermeasures if voters approve a statewide ceiling on
class size that he opposes.</TE>
<TE>   Although its potential political impact is unknown, Bush's
daughter Noelle, 25, has also been in the news for her problems with
drugs, and should appear at a court hearing today to determine
whether she can stay in a treatment program or be returned to the
regular criminal justice system.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, McBride, the folksy lawyer and Vietnam War veteran
who upset ex-Atty. Gen. Janet Reno in the Sept. 10 Democratic
primary, appears not to provoke negative feelings among many voters,
if people have a clear impression of him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's strange, but he seems to have taken a page from Ronald
Reagan," said Aubrey Jewett, associate professor of political science
at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. "He has selected a
few issues, and talks only about them."</TE>
<TE>   The keystone of McBride's campaign is improving the state's public
schools, which he contends have declined disgracefully under Bush,
who paints himself as the "education governor." During a radio debate
between the candidates Tuesday night, the GOP incumbent countered
that African American elementary school pupils have made "massive
gains" in reading in his four years in office.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates are set to meet for one final televised debate in
Orlando on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the edge at this point goes to Bush, but McBride still
has a shot," said Jewett of the University of Central Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeb's negatives are strong as it is," said Gonzalez of the
University of Miami. "There is no reason for McBride to attack him.
He's played it well up to this point. He will try to build up his
positives, looking statesmanlike, like a credible candidate, like
someone people can trust."</TE>

<HD>Graham's Meeting Could Be Last</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>IRVING, Texas</DL>
<LD>The Rev. Billy Graham plans to speak on four consecutive days at
Texas Stadium starting today in what could be the last revival
meeting the evangelist ever holds after more than a half-century of
preaching.</LD>
<LD>   Graham turns 84 on Nov. 7, suffers from Parkinson's disease,
underwent surgery to remove fluid from his brain two years ago and is
generally in frail health.</LD>
<LD>   While in Cincinnati in June, Graham said that he felt weaker than
ever. He has announced no future meetings, and an aide said he will
weigh his plans after the event.</LD>
<TE>   Graham said "I feel a lot better here than I did in Cincinnati
when we began this four months ago."</TE>
<TE>   "This type of meeting is needed," he said. "It's needed in every
city in the country and it's needed at this particular hour in the
history of the world."</TE>
<TE>   Graham is scheduled to preach each of the four days the event is
held at the stadium. If his health prevents him from speaking,
Graham's son and designated successor, Franklin Graham, would step
in.</TE>

<HD>Senators Delay Vote on Ex-Aide to Thurmond</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Republicans failed to get the Senate to confirm retiring Sen. Strom
Thurmond's former aide to the federal bench, as the year-end rush
began to try to get dozens of nominations approved.</LD>
<LD>   At the end of each congressional session, presidential nominees
who have not been confirmed have their names sent back to the White
House and have to begin again. If that happens, it is not guaranteed
that the president will renominate the person.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans want to ensure that U.S. District Judge Dennis Shedd
of South Carolina, nominated to the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals
in Richmond, Va., doesn't have that problem.</LD>
<TE>   Thurmond ends a nearly half-century career in the Senate in
January and said he was promised that Shedd would be given a vote.</TE>
<TE>   But Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) delayed a
committee vote Wednesday, saying there was opposition to Shedd's
nomination in South Carolina. Civil rights groups say his judicial
opinions show a "disregard for laws protecting the disabled" and "a
high level of insensitivity on issues of race."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) called on the Senate
to pull the nomination out of committee and bring it directly to a
floor vote. Shedd likely would pass a Senate floor vote, supporters
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel so strongly about the unfairness of the treatment of this
nominee and the way it was reflected on Sen. Thurmond that I have to
take action," Lott said.</TE>
<TE>   But Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) blocked the
maneuver, saying the practice has always been to require a committee
vote before a full Senate vote. He also would not guarantee that
Shedd would get a committee vote before the chamber's session ends.</TE>
<TE>   The battle over Bush's judicial candidates has blocked other
nominees from getting confirmed. Ambassadorships, board appointments,
and lower-level department officials tend to collect on the Senate
schedule, then typically all nominees are approved at the end of the
year.</TE>

<HD>Latino Community Aches for Migrants Who Died in Boxcar</HD>
<DH>Neighbors gather for memorial service to pay respects for
11 immigrants. They are fearful that others may suffer the same fate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DENISON, Iowa -- The freight trains clank through the flat fields of
northwest Iowa several times a day, rattling past one-block farm
towns, towing boxcars, tanker cars and grain cars sealed tight
against the prairie winds.</LD>
<LD>   Nadia Castanela heard them screech past as usual on Wednesday. And
she shuddered.</LD>
<LD>   "I think of the people who came that way," she said. "I think of
the others who might still come."</LD>
<TE>   She did not need to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of her neighbors joined her at a memorial service in a
drizzly dusk to pray for the souls of 11 unidentified adults who
perished in a stifling grain hopper, apparently while attempting to
sneak into the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Their bodies -- barely more than huddled skeletons -- were
discovered here earlier this week when the Union Pacific hopper that
entombed them was opened for a routine cleaning after four months in
storage in Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   After a full day of autopsies in Des Moines, the state medical
examiner determined that seven of the dead were men and four were
women. The official cause of death: overheating and dehydration.
Beyond that, there are few facts. Only horrible conjecture.</TE>
<TE>   "Such a very slow, very sad, very awful death," said Castanela,
27. She pulled her young son close.</TE>
<TE>   "I came to ask God that they have peace."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have not yet determined where the immigrants came
from, or even when they died. Yet state and local officials have been
fielding calls from anxious relatives wondering if the loved ones
they have not heard from in months could be among the corpses.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central America
hide themselves in freight trains each year in a dangerous gamble to
push north.</TE>
<TE>   Most often, they are guided into cars by a smuggler, or coyote,
who may charge several hundred or even several thousand dollars for
his services. Few bring along food or water.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually the smuggler knows where the train is going and gets
someone there to meet it and unlock the car," said Julio Salinas, a
supervisor with the Border Patrol's office in McAllen, Texas. "But,
as in this case, it doesn't always happen."</TE>
<TE>   Last June, Border Patrol agents found 26 illegal immigrants locked
in unbearable heat inside two grain cars that had been pushed to the
side of the rails instead of coupled to the freight train.</TE>
<TE>   The migrants -- including two pregnant women -- had been banging
on the sides of the car, frantic to draw rescuers.</TE>
<TE>   Through August, the Border Patrol had apprehended nearly 14,000
illegal stowaways on freight trains. That's down from nearly 47,000
arrests five years ago. Still, train jumping remains "a pretty
common" approach for migrants who make it across the Rio Grande but
want to move deeper into the U.S., Salinas said.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the most horrific incidents, agents in 1987 discovered
18 Mexicans dead in a boxcar that had been pushed to the side in
Sierra Blanca, Texas. The lone survivor said the group had been
locked in the car in El Paso.</TE>
<TE>   The hopper car that ended up at the grain elevator here left
Matamoros, Mexico, four months ago. Such trains go through four
checkpoints after crossing into the U.S. No one yet knows whether the
migrants evaded those checks when they climbed into the hopper.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows, either, where they hoped to go.</TE>
<TE>   But their deaths have deeply moved the Latino community here in
this industrious town of 7,300.</TE>
<TE>   Like many rural communities across the Midwest, Denison has become
an increasingly popular draw for legal immigrants seeking work in the
slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants.</TE>
<TE>   The Latino population in the Midwest has nearly doubled in the
past 10 years. Here in Denison, the boom has been remarkable: Eight
years ago, the town had just a handful of minorities. Now, Latino
immigrants make up nearly 20% of the population.</TE>
<TE>   And while most of them have taken far less perilous paths to the
United States, they can identify with the desperation -- for jobs,
for education, for distant family -- that might have driven 11 men
and women to seal themselves in a grain hopper heading north.</TE>
<TE>   A choir sang. A dozen candles flickered in an alcove by the altar.</TE>
<TE>   Off in the corner, 17-year-old Aaron Espino prayed. "When I see
the trains now," he said, "I think of them. I think there could be
people in there. There could be people in there dying."</TE>

<HD>High Degree of Terror Swayed Military to Act</HD>
<DH>Army surveillance plane can do the work of dozens of police
copters. But experts fear the start of a merger of roles of soldier
and policeman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Hendren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>On a clear day, the Army surveillance aircraft the Pentagon will use
to track the shooter who is terrorizing greater Washington can tell a
red sedan from a white van anywhere along the Beltway that encircles
the city.</LD>
<LD>   If two planes rotate shifts, as some defense officials are
suggesting, they can do the work of dozens of police helicopters over
several counties surrounding the nation's densely populated capital
city, 24 hours a day.</LD>
<LD>   Although they are wary of a military mission that is creeping ever
closer to homeland defense, Pentagon officials offered the RC-7
surveillance plane this week to help hunt for a local killer. They
did it, in part, because of the high level of terror wrought by a
series of random slayings that have killed nine and seriously injured
two in the last two weeks, defense officials and analysts said
Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   The task also offered a tantalizing opportunity for the military:
a difficult training mission applicable immediately in military
hotspots from Afghanistan to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot imagine a tougher surveillance mission," said Ralph
Peters, an author and former Army intelligence officer. "If you can
find someone in Washington, D.C., you can find anyone in Baghdad."</TE>
<TE>   In bringing a military surveillance team into the hunt for the
shooter, law-enforcement authorities presented the Pentagon with a
daunting task. They are asking the same men and equipment that have
been unable to find Osama bin Laden among the barren hills of
Afghanistan and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad to pinpoint
an individual whose whereabouts in the Washington region are unknown
-- until he fires.</TE>
<TE>   The RC-7 plane highlights the broad range of resources -- from
counter-sniper experts to sensors that can detect a bullet's path --
that the Pentagon could bring to the task. Defense officials and
military experts say, and many fear, that participation in this case
could mark the beginning of a merger of the roles of soldier and
policeman.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld authorized the Pentagon's
involvement this week after the Joint Chiefs of Staff asked the Army,
the Navy, the Air Force and the Marines what they could contribute.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, the agreement does not limit the Pentagon's
contribution to just the RC-7. The Pentagon merely acceded to an FBI
request for "aerial surveillance," said Air Force Col. Jay DeFrank, a
Pentagon spokesman. Defense officials confirmed, on condition of
anonymity, that the RC-7 would be used, although other aircraft could
be used later. The agreement is broad enough to include the use of
satellite imagery, but a defense official said that has either not
been considered or has not been requested by the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   The RC-7 won out over the P-3 Orion surveillance plane offered by
the Navy largely because the Army aircraft, a modified commuter plane
similar to those used by US Airways at Washington's Reagan National
Airport, would be less conspicuous aloft than the more distinctive
Navy plane. Military officials use the four-engine turboprop plane,
made by De Havilland of Canada, for detecting marijuana and cocaine
fields in Colombia and for clandestine surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   Its infrared camera has a heat sensor that can detect anything
from body heat to car exhaust and is capable of working in low light,
transmitting live video signals or saving them to tape. It is
designed to loiter at a slow speed -- about 125 mph -- in all types
of weather for up to 10 hours, in day or night, and offers the same
radar coverage as a U-2 spy plane or a B-2 bomber. It can transmit
voice interceptions and data either to satellites or to users on the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   "The theory on this is that they'll have this aircraft flying in
circles over downtown Washington and they get a 911 call and the
police tells the TV camera operator on the airplane where to point
the camera," said John Pike, a defense analyst at GlobalSecurity.org,
an Alexandria, Va., research group. "They basically start panning the
camera out from the shooting scene until the operator sees a white
van fleeing the crime scene."</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the camera operator can radio in the location of
the vehicle -- police recently released a composite picture, based on
witness interviews, of a white Chevrolet Astro van with a ladder rack
-- and let police know which streets to block.</TE>
<TE>   In principle, police helicopters can do the job, but they don't
fly as high or see as far. Unlike helicopters, a single plane flying
at 20,000 feet can circle the region and then home in on a spot
within seconds after a report of a shooting. While police on the
ground might lose the getaway car, aerial surveillance rarely does,
defense analysts said. But the car has to be identified first.</TE>
<TE>   "That means getting the initial spotting, which police haven't
been able to do," said Tom Sanderson, a terrorism analyst at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington public
policy center.</TE>
<TE>   Military analysts warn the public not to expect a quick catch.
Like other military surveillance equipment, the plane is primarily
designed to spot movements of vehicles, machinery and cadres of
soldiers, not a lone suspect. The plane's thermal detectors could
detect a muzzle flash if it were staking out a limited area, such as
a shopping center, but not a sprawling region, such as Northern
Virginia, home to several outdoor shooting ranges.</TE>
<TE>   "The technology we're talking about here really wasn't designed to
do the sort of search that the sniper investigation requires. It's
nice that the military cooperates, but I would not expect any great
breakthroughs as a result," said Loren Thompson, a defense analyst at
the Lexington Institute, a public policy center in Arlington, Va.
"For the most part, if you don't know where a crime is going to occur
before it occurs, a lot of the technology simply isn't very useful."</TE>
<TE>   Any move toward increased involvement in domestic security would
likely be slowed by two other forces.</TE>
<TE>   First, soldiers don't like it. Like peacekeeping, domestic
policing is among the least favorite duties of both front-line
soldiers and Rumsfeld, who has increasingly sought to extricate
soldiers from existing missions in Bosnia and to limit military
patrols in the United States. Soldiers, sailors and Marines say they
signed up for combat, not police work.</TE>
<TE>   "As for the mission, we don't want it," one Army officer said, on
condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Second, defense officials and civil libertarians alike have
expressed a concern over the limitations of the Posse Comitatus Act,
which limits the military's role in domestic affairs. The rule could
easily be circumvented by using National Guard units under state
authority, or simply by having civilian authorities, such as
President Bush, request the military involvement.</TE>
<TE>   "You get a little chill when you think of the military jumping
into this stuff, because where does it stop?" analyst Sanderson said.
"This is a terrible case, but it's not a national disaster."</TE>
<TE>   That concern has increased the Pentagon's reluctance to offer
other capabilities, such as Army and Air Force counter-sniper
experts, who could profile or even target the shooter. Defense
officials quickly ruled out using unmanned drones, which are in high
demand and low supply.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the Pentagon's "mission creep" is inevitable, many
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "I do feel that in the future we're going to see more use of the
military domestically," Peters said. "When terrorism strikes
domestically, the military is often the best tool."</TE>

<HD>Court Looks at Race Bias on Juries</HD>
<DH>Justices, hearing a Texas case, are asked to end lingering
discrimination against seating blacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court was asked Wednesday to end the
lingering race bias on juries by putting trial judges and prosecutors
on notice that blacks may not be questioned differently from whites
when potential jurors are being selected.</LD>
<LD>   More than a century ago, the high court said states may not
exclude blacks from juries. But ending all such discrimination has
proved to be surprisingly difficult.</LD>
<LD>   Former U.S. Solicitor Gen. Seth Waxman challenged the justices to
reverse the death sentence given a Texas murderer, saying racial bias
tainted the man's jury.</LD>
<TE>   "This is truly an exceptional case," Waxman said. "Whatever this
court decides, this case is going to stand as a benchmark" in the
long struggle to abolish racial discrimination in courts.</TE>
<TE>   The defendant, Thomas Miller-El, came within days of being
executed in February. The high court blocked the execution and then
agreed to review the case because it raised a troubling issue from
the past.</TE>
<TE>   Only one of the 12 people who served on the Dallas jury that tried
the accused murderer in 1986 was black. Miller-El is black, and he
was charged with robbing, tying up and shooting two white clerks at a
Holiday Inn. One died. The other lived and testified against him.</TE>
<TE>   There seemed to be little doubt of Miller-El's guilt, and
prosecutors were determined to win a death sentence. They excluded 10
of the 11 African Americans who were prepared to serve on the jury.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, a Dallas judge, the Texas state courts and the U.S.
Court of Appeals in New Orleans all rejected claims that race bias
may have infected the jury.</TE>
<TE>   At one level, the case (Miller-El vs. Cockrell) raises a recurring
problem. How can judges tell the difference between a prosecutor's
legitimate hunch and an illegitimate racial bias?</TE>
<TE>   In selecting juries, prosecution and defense lawyers are both free
to exclude an equal number of potential jurors. They are entitled to
look at and question potential jurors and eliminate them based on
suspicions that they will be biased against their case.</TE>
<TE>   However, race may not be the basis for this suspicion, the high
court stressed in 1986, ruling in Batson vs. Kentucky. That decision
said trial judges should question prosecutors who turn away an
unusual number of blacks from the jury.</TE>
<TE>   The case heard Wednesday tests how the Batson decision is supposed
to work in practice.</TE>
<TE>   The blacks who were dropped from the Dallas jury in 1986 were
excluded "because of their views, not because of their race," Gena
Bunn, a Texas state attorney, told the justices.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, prosecutors may exclude potential jurors "with
unfavorable views of the death penalty, regardless of their race,"
she said in her brief. "The vast majority of African American
panelists [who came for jury service in the 1986 trial] were either
opposed to the death penalty or were unwilling to impose it."</TE>
<TE>   But Waxman and the Texas defense lawyers disputed that view. They
pointed to a history of blatant racial bias in Dallas County and a
continuing practice of subtle discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Wade served as the Dallas district attorney from 1951 to
1987, and he insisted his prosecutors keep minorities off of juries.</TE>
<TE>   "Do not take Jews, Negroes, Dagos, Mexicans or a member of any
minority race on a jury, no matter how rich or how well educated.
They will not do on juries," prosecutors were told in a 1963 manual.</TE>
<TE>   Later editions revised that language but maintained the same
message. "Minority races almost always empathize with the defendant,"
and should be excluded where possible, according to a manual that was
used as late as the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   A Dallas Morning News study published in 1986, the year of the
Miller-El trial, found more than nine in 10 African Americans who
were available to serve on juries were excluded.</TE>
<TE>   A black person who was "hesitant [about the death penalty] was 3
1/2 times more likely to be struck" from the jury than a white person
who expressed the same view, Waxman said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the justices signaled they are likely to side with
Miller-El and against the Texas prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   "The historical evidence is very persuasive, overwhelming,"
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said. And the pattern of questioning is
"strong circumstantial evidence" of racial bias on the part of the
prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   If this case does not warrant a reversal, "you could never have a
successful Batson challenge," added Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. "A
prosecutor could always give a neutral reason" for excluding a black
person from the jury, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Only Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist openly sided with the
Texas prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   "You have two strong presumptions going against you," he told
Waxman. He was referring to past rulings and recent laws saying
federal judges should defer to trial judges and state courts that
reviewed the evidence.</TE>
<TE>   But Rehnquist was one of only two dissenters from the 1986 Batson
ruling that required judges to question prosecutors who exclude too
many blacks from a jury.</TE>
<TE>   The case appeared to be one of rare instances in which the chief
justice stood in the distinct minority on the court.</TE>
<TE>   A ruling on the issue can be expected in several months.</TE>

<HD>Mission Accomplished for Atlantis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>After a tearful farewell, space shuttle Atlantis and its astronauts
undocked Wednesday from the International Space Station, leaving it a
bigger and more elaborate outpost.</LD>
<LD>   Shouts of "We want to stay!" came from Atlantis just before the
two spacecraft parted company 250 miles above the Russian-Ukrainian
border, ending one week of joint flight.</LD>
<LD>   During their mission, astronauts delivered a $390-million girder
to the space station and made three spacewalks to install it.</LD>
<TE>   The six shuttle crew members, who are due back on Earth on Friday,
admired their work from afar. "It was wonderful to pull away from the
station and see the visible signs of our success," pilot Pamela
Melroy said.</TE>
<TE>   The space station's three crew members -- an American and two
Russians -- expect more guests in two weeks, but a deadly launch
accident in Russia could delay the visit.</TE>
<TE>   A three-man Soyuz rocket is scheduled to lift off Oct. 28 from
Kazakhstan to deliver a new space station lifeboat. On Tuesday, a
slightly different type of Soyuz exploded shortly after liftoff,
killing a soldier on the ground and destroying the satellite on
board.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Castle, deputy chief flight director, said it is too soon to
know whether the accident would postpone the next flight. Two
Russians and a Belgian will be aboard.</TE>
<TE>   NASA has its own problems, meanwhile, investigating the launch-day
failure Oct. 7 of some of the explosive charges that are supposed to
release the bolts holding down the space shuttle at liftoff. Each
bolt has two charges, only one of which is needed for release. The
other charge is there as a backup.</TE>
<TE>   "Half of them fired and half of them didn't. We know that for a
fact. We just don't know what caused that second command not to get
through," launch director Mike Leinbach said. "We're doing a lot of
tests on the ground here, obviously, and so far we haven't found any
smoking gun."</TE>
<TE>   NASA wants to understand what went wrong before launching shuttle
Endeavour on Nov. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Leinbach would not speculate on what could have happened if the
second set of charges had not fired, and stressed that "redundancy
created a safe liftoff."</TE>
<TE>   Endeavour will deliver another girder to the space station, along
with replacements for the station crew.</TE>

<HD>Serial Killer Slip-Ups</HD>
<DH>Murderers have often been undone by sloppiness as their
crime sprees continue. Could that be the Beltway sniper's undoing?</DH>

<AU>Paul Richter and Aaron Zitner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Juan V. Corona was careful enough in crime that he
killed and buried 25 farm workers in rural Sutter County, Calif.,
without leaving a single witness or weapon that could provide direct
evidence against him.</LD>
<LD>   Yet as his four-month string of killings continued in early 1971,
Corona seemed to become more casual. As he buried one of his later
victims, he dropped a signed bank deposit slip into the shallow
grave, providing police a key piece of the circumstantial evidence
that helped lead to his conviction.</LD>
<LD>   Serial murderers have often been undone by a sloppiness that
increases as their crimes continue.</LD>
<TE>   Experts believe the same pattern may become the undoing of the
sniper who has killed nine people in the Washington, D.C., area since
Oct. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Though crafty in many ways, the sniper has put himself at risk,
experts say, by apparently using the same weapon and vehicles over
and over.</TE>
<TE>   In his most recent attack, on Monday night, he ventured close
enough to a crowded mall in Fairfax County, Va., that some shoppers
were able to provide details of his appearance and license plate.</TE>
<TE>   As time passes, "it looks like he's getting a lot sloppier," said
Michael Rustigan, a criminologist at San Francisco State University.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's killer is all but unique in the annals of crime,
because he apparently picks his victims at random, enabling him to
frighten a metropolitan area in a way few killers could. But he is a
serial killer all the same, meeting the FBI definition: three or more
victims with a "cooling-off period" of unspecified time between the
murders.</TE>
<TE>   There have been a large number of murderers who have killed a
number of victims in one shooting rampage, such as George Hennard,
who killed 22 people and wounded 23 in his armed attack on a Killeen,
Texas, cafeteria in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   And there have been many others who killed over an extended
period, such as "Son of Sam" slayer David Berkowitz and Ted Bundy.</TE>
<TE>   Such serial killers usually pick one category -- such as women or
minorities -- as their victims.</TE>
<TE>   But experts say it is highly unusual for a killer to attack
strangers picked at random in a concentrated period, as the
Washington-area sniper apparently has in the last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The concentrated timing adds to the terror, they say. The fact
that he is apparently picking strangers makes it tougher for police
to track him.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone who goes around killing absolute strangers is the hardest
for law enforcement to find, because there are no easy connections
between the victims and the perpetrator," said Colin Simpson, a
prosecutor in Cook County, Ill., who had a role in the case of serial
killer John Wayne Gacy.</TE>
<TE>   According to the experts, serial killers who are cautious when
they commit their first crime often become bold to the point of
recklessness when it starts to look as if they can outwit the cops.</TE>
<TE>   Another vulnerability is their frequent desire to take credit,
with friends or the public at large, for what they've done.</TE>
<TE>   And serial murderers have often been nabbed because they sloppily
commit minor crimes -- even just speeding or parking violations --
that allow police to track them down.</TE>
<TE>   Killers slip up "because they get greedy and feel they can do it
over and over again ... and because they get this feeling they can
outsmart police," said Tod Burke, a former police officer and now a
professor of criminology at Radford University in Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Corona, who was a farm contractor, had worked out his approach
with care. He tended to choose as victims itinerant farm workers and
drifters who were nondescript and without a lot of personal
connections, and thus less likely to be missed or remembered.</TE>
<TE>   "He was fairly careful," said Roger Pierucci, a lawyer in the Lake
Tahoe area who was one of the prosecutors in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Corona slipped up by allowing the bank slip to fall from his shirt
pocket as he buried a victim in the dark.</TE>
<TE>   "It was apparently just a simple oversight," Pierucci said.</TE>
<TE>   On another occasion, Corona also dropped receipts from meat-market
purchases into a grave.</TE>
<TE>   Bundy got a reputation as one of the wiliest serial killers ever
during a cross-country murder streak between 1973 and 1978 that led
to the deaths of at least 30 females.</TE>
<TE>   In state after state, Bundy was able to elude detection.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Bundy wasn't smart enough to avoid picking a fistfight with a
policeman who pulled him over on a routine traffic stop in Florida in
1978.</TE>
<TE>   He was convicted of three murders in Florida and executed in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Berkowitz killed six people and wounded seven, terrorizing New
York City in 1976 and 1977. He prowled New York's darkened streets,
shooting women parked in cars.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Berkowitz made the avoidable mistake of parking illegally.</TE>
<TE>   When a witness said she had seen a dark figure carrying a traffic
ticket, police began the search that led them to the murderer.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Levin, director of the Brudnick Center on Violence at
Northeastern University in Boston, said multiple killers have often
been tripped up by vehicle violations because cars are a tool they
need -- and one that is closely regulated by the government.</TE>
<TE>   "We license vehicles. We specify the rules about driving. And
these killers are people who don't follow rules," Levin said.</TE>
<TE>   Another prolific killer caught this way was Joel David Rifkin, who
killed 17 prostitutes in New York between 1991 and 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Rifkin told police he picked up the women in Manhattan, had sex
with them, strangled them and dumped their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   But Rifkin was stopped one night for driving without a license
plate. Police found one of the victims in the back of his pickup
truck.</TE>
<TE>   A traffic stop also led to the arrest of Randy Kraft, a
soft-spoken computer programmer believed to have killed as many as 45
young men in Southern California, Oregon and Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Kraft picked up hitchhikers between 18 and 25 years old. He often
tortured them before strangling them with their belts.</TE>
<TE>   But Kraft's murders ended in 1983 when police pulled him over and
found a dead Marine in his front seat. He is now on death row.</TE>
<TE>   Another killer who terrorized the nation's capital was the
so-called "shotgun stalker," James E. Swann Jr., who was arrested
after an off-duty policeman saw his car run several red lights.</TE>
<TE>   Over a period of two months in early 1993, Swann killed four
people and wounded five during attacks in which he drove down the
street and blasted pedestrians at short range with a shotgun.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, when traffic violations don't snare them, other
petty crimes can.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Lake and Charles Ng killed 11 people in a kidnapping and
sex-slavery spree in 1984 and 1985.</TE>
<TE>   The pair took the victims to their hideout in remote Wilseyville
in Northern California, where they tortured and killed them. They
buried the bodies on the property.</TE>
<TE>   Lake and Ng were stopped at a South San Francisco store for
allegedly shoplifting a $75 vise. When police searched Lake's trunk,
they found a silencer and bullets. Once in the police station, Lake
took a cyanide pill to commit suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Ng fled to Canada -- where he was picked up for shoplifting as
well. He was found guilty in 1999 of murdering 11 people.</TE>
<TE>   And there is the killer's own hubris.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Kaczynski, the "Unabomber," was so meticulous in avoiding
detection that he took buses all the way from his remote Montana
hideout to California to post packages containing mail bombs,
Rustigan said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet after 16 attacks between 1978 and 1995 that killed three and
injured 23, Kaczyinski felt a need to explain himself.</TE>
<TE>   He demanded that the New York Times and the Washington Post print
a rambling 35,000-word manifesto declaring that technology would be
the downfall of society.</TE>
<TE>   His brother, David, was able to identify him from it, and
Kaczynski was caught.</TE>
<TE>   Except for his compulsion to draw attention, "he would have been
bombing into old age," criminologist Rustigan said.</TE>
<TE>   One case that had some similarities to the current string of
killings was that of an Ohio hunter who killed five people between
1989 and 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Dillon roamed the countryside and picked off two hunters,
two fishermen and a jogger. His downfall was discussing with a friend
how one could get away with random murders.</TE>
<TE>   The friend brought him to the attention of police, who matched a
slug from his rifle with one from a victim. Dillon is now serving a
life term.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because of the added complexity of stranger-on-stranger
attacks, New York City police were never able to solve a series of
sniping attacks around Penn Station over 10 months in 1983 that left
one person dead and seven wounded.</TE>
<TE>   The sniper used a .25-caliber pistol and fired it from locations
around the station from which he could sneak away unseen.</TE>
<TE>   New York police formed a large task force to look into the case,
but never learned anything of the identity of that sniper.</TE>
<TE>   Rustigan says that while he doesn't know of any case that
precisely duplicates that of the Washington sniper, he believes the
attacker has been given credit for more guile than he has.</TE>
<TE>   If he were smart, he would have tried to reduce police vigilance
by taking off a longer period between killings, Rustigan said.</TE>
<TE>   He would have been smarter to have switched guns and vehicles, and
he shouldn't have ventured into the congested Fairfax County shopping
mall Monday night where, it appears, some shoppers got a look at him.</TE>
<TE>   He said the pattern seems to suggest that this sniper is not a
careful, calculating killer, but a man who is "on a high -- a
frenzied rush -- from this game he's carrying on with the cops."</TE>
<TE>   And that means, Rustigan added, "that he's probably not in the big
leagues of stealthy serial killers -- and he'll probably soon be
caught."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>A federal committee voted Wednesday to recommend vaccinating about
510,000 hospital workers against smallpox, bringing its earlier
proposal closer to the Bush administration's suggestion.</LD>
<LD>   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices voted 8 to 1 for the plan, which
amounts to vaccinating about 100 workers at every hospital in the
nation that could handle smallpox patients.</LD>
<LD>   Those receiving shots at the hospitals with "negative pressure
rooms" would include emergency room doctors, nurses, technicians and
selected security and housekeeping workers.</LD>
<TE>   The vaccine can cause dangerous side effects, even death, in a
fraction of patients. Smallpox has been declared eradicated, but some
experts fear terrorists may have samples of the virus and could use
it as a devastating biological weapon.</TE>
<TE>   The recommendation is not binding; the final decision will be made
by the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Under a plan considered by the Bush administration, vaccinations
would first be offered to emergency room workers, with about 510,000
expected to take it, then it would be available to about 10 million
health-care and emergency workers, and finally to the public.</TE>

<HD>Witnesses Fail to Offer Clear Sniper Portrait</HD>
<DH>Conflicting accounts prevent police from producing a
composite picture of the killer. Public given guidelines on supplying
tips.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>ROCKVILLE, Md. -- Distance, night's dimness and a rifle blast's
chaotic aftermath hindered eyewitnesses to the latest slaying by the
shooter who has terrorized the Washington area for two weeks,
limiting their ability to provide police with a clear portrait of the
gunman in action, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators were encouraged by the first close-range witness
accounts of a male gunman who was seen targeting FBI analyst Linda
Franklin, 47, moments before she was slain by a single gunshot Monday
night outside a Home Depot in Falls Church, Va. But three of the
accounts turned out to be thin and at odds, officials said Wednesday,
preventing law-enforcement artists from preparing a composite drawing
of a dark-skinned man reported as a possible suspect.</LD>
<LD>   "There are a couple of people who believe they saw a man shoot,"
said Montgomery County Police Capt. Nancy Demme. But "unfortunately
distance and darkness, and perhaps adrenaline, have made them unable
to give a clear composite."</LD>
<TE>   The frailty of human perception that undercuts the probe's newest
leads is a familiar menace to homicide detectives. In the careening
moments that follow the report of a gunshot, witnesses often glimpse
only shards of reality, filling in gaps with misinformation. Their
accounts can be limited and tainted by confusion, fear, news reports
and stories told by other witnesses at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   "One shot, the body falls and people react to it," said University
of Delaware criminologist Carl B. Klockars. "There are a lot of
things going on quickly. People are looking at different aspects of
commotion, and they're likely to be distracted."</TE>
<TE>   One witness interviewed minutes after the shooting Monday
reportedly told police that he saw a man aiming a rifle at Franklin,
who was putting packages in her car, from about 40 yards away just
before she fell. Officials said Wednesday that according to the
witness, the gunman was wielding an AK-74 semiautomatic rifle, a
variant of the Kalashnikov AK-47 that can be adapted to fire
.223-caliber rounds.</TE>
<TE>   But the eyewitness was unable to provide detailed facial
characteristics of the gunman, and his account conflicted with
several other descriptions of the suspect, Demme said. "Each witness
firmly believes what he saw," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nine people have been killed and two wounded in the last two weeks
as the shooter has terrorized a sprawling suburban landscape of
commercial streets, chain-store shopping malls, gas stations and even
a placid middle school campus. The killer has grown progressively
bolder, opening fire last week on a victim within sight of a Virginia
state trooper, then choosing the parking lot of a Home Depot crowded
with shoppers to stalk and fatally wound his latest victim.</TE>
<TE>   "The killer's picking a time and place where he feels
comfortable," said one task force investigator. The choice of a Home
Depot parking lot jammed with cars "gave him cover. There were a lot
of cars moving around. The witnesses didn't know necessarily what to
look for. So far, we've got the best we can hope for."</TE>
<TE>   Police are often hesitant to issue composite sketches without
"strong corroborating" accounts, said Portland, Maine, Police Chief
Michael Chitwood, who became a Philadelphia police legend during
eight years as a homicide investigator there. "Once you put that out,
people are going to focus and leads will start pouring in. If the
composite's not right, the whole investigation can go off in the
wrong direction."</TE>
<TE>   Officials close to the murder probe said investigators were
initially energized by several of the new leads given by witnesses in
Falls Church on Monday. Fairfax County Police Chief Thomas Manger
said hours after the shooting that he was "confident" the witness
interviews gleaned by investigators "would lead to an arrest."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Fairfax County detectives again interviewed several
witnesses. Among them was Washington construction worker Robert
Young, who said he heard a muffled gunshot and then saw a white van
driven by a dark-skinned man who appeared to be of Middle Eastern
descent.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a good look at the guy," Young said, adding that the driver
"seemed to be excessively irritated because he couldn't pull into my
lane. I thought this fool was going to want to get out of the van and
duke or something. But he didn't. He kept on going."</TE>
<TE>   The accounts of an "olive-skinned" suspect spurred police to
briefly detain several dark-complexioned men along U.S. 50 near the
Seven Corners Shopping Center.</TE>
<TE>   But concern about the reliability of those accounts led Demme on
Wednesday to pointedly urge citizens who might get caught up in the
next shooting scene to "seek cover," then "commit what you saw to
memory, have a pen available on your person and if paper is not
available, write it on your hand."</TE>
<TE>   Demme also cautioned that individual accounts might even be
"contaminated" by other witnesses if crime scene observers are not
kept apart.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses at the scene of Franklin's murder said Fairfax County
officers appeared to move quickly to ensure there was no "leakage" of
their accounts. Joy Zucker, a freelance television producer who
arrived at the Home Depot about five minutes after the shooting, said
that at least four witnesses had already been whisked away by police
for interviews. Police took care, she said, to keep those witnesses
away from a larger crowd inside the store.</TE>
<TE>   "It was impressive how they managed to get them away from the
frenzy so quickly and quietly without anyone noticing," Zucker said.</TE>
<TE>   But Zucker said another dozen witnesses who also had views of the
crime scene waited for long minutes outside the store entrance until
police took them aside, one by one, for questioning. Remarkably, she
said, "there was just a stunned silence. These people were not
comparing notes on what they saw. They were still taking in the shock
of it all."</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Pezdek, a professor of psychology at Claremont Graduate
University and an expert on witness behavior, said that police need
to keep witnesses from mingling.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clearly not a good strategy," she said of allowing witnesses
to talk with one another. "The witnesses can shape each other's
memory and influence each other."</TE>
<TE>   That message was delivered Friday by task force officials to local
police chiefs from dozens of departments, from Baltimore to Richmond,
Va. During a closed meeting in a University of Maryland conference
room, FBI agents and other senior task force officials warned the
gathered police officials that they needed to adhere to
"standardized" plans to deal with witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   The officials were told bluntly that they had to identify, and
quickly segregate, the witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to lose witness statements because of taint from
other witnesses," a task force official said. The police departments
affected by the killings, which now include six separate
jurisdictions, have "done a pretty good job" in preventing witness
contamination, the official added.</TE>

<HD>Unrepentant Spy Gets 25 Years</HD>
<DH>'I obeyed my conscience,' a former intelligence agency
analyst says of her work for Cuba.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Johanna Neuman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Saying she put her conscience before her country, a
former U.S. intelligence analyst was sentenced Wednesday to 25 years
in prison for conspiring to spy for Cuba, becoming one of the few
women in American history convicted of espionage.</LD>
<LD>   An unrepentant Ana Belen Montes -- the highest-ranking operative
known to have been placed in the U.S. government by Cuba -- told the
court, "I obeyed my conscience rather than the law. I believe our
government's policy toward Cuba is cruel and unfair, profoundly
unneighborly, and I felt morally obligated to help the island defend
itself from our efforts to impose our values and our political system
on it."</LD>
<LD>   That Montes spied for political reasons -- no money is alleged to
have changed hands except for nominal expenses -- makes her unusual
among recent spies. Aldrich H. Ames was a top CIA operative convicted
in 1994 of spying for the Soviet Union. He had disclosed the identity
of at least a dozen agents who were subsequently executed, and
received enough money to buy a Jaguar and a $540,000 home, with cash,
in suburban Virginia. Robert Philip Hanssen, the FBI agent who
pleaded guilty in February last year to spying for the Soviets,
received $1.4 million in cash and diamonds.</LD>
<TE>   But the other distinctive feature of the Montes case is that, as
the Defense Intelligence Agency's top Cuba expert, she was
responsible for writing U.S. policy on Cuba, including a famous 1998
shift softening the Pentagon's assessment of the threat posed by
Cuban President Fidel Castro at a time when the State Department was
citing Cuba on a list of terrorist nations.</TE>
<TE>   "Few spies are that highly placed," said David Major, a former FBI
counterintelligence officer who is now vice president of the Centre
for Counterintelligence and Security Studies. "From the Cuban
perspective, to have the person who writes American policy in your
court, we're talking about a very influential person. In the
espionage world, this is real gold."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say some of the material Montes turned over to the
Cubans is so sensitive that it cannot be disclosed in open court. But
it is known from court filings that she revealed the identity of four
Cubans working undercover for the United States, disclosed
information on war games conducted by the U.S. Atlantic Command, and
gave Cuban intelligence classified files, photos and documents.</TE>
<TE>   Court documents say Montes used encrypted messages to communicate
with Cuban intelligence services and received her instructions from
Havana via shortwave radio. She used coded numeric pager messages at
public pay phones throughout suburban Maryland and the District of
Columbia, including codes for "I received message" and "danger."</TE>
<TE>   The documents did not disclose why federal counterintelligence
officials grew suspicious of her -- like Ames, she passed a polygraph
exam -- but some in the Cuban American community speculate that
Montes, who went to work for the DIA in 1985, was tripped up by the
FBI's unraveling in 1998 of a Cuban spy ring called the Wasp Network
(La Red Avispa  in Spanish).</TE>
<TE>   "They noticed a pattern of phone traffic and beeper traffic that
was similar to the Wasp Network," said Joe Garcia, executive director
of the Miami-based Cuban American National Foundation. "They snuck
into her apartment, looked in her computer, and discovered the
classified documents."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators began homing in on Montes in May 2001. Aware that
Cuba was likely funneling information from her to other capitals --
such as Moscow and Baghdad -- FBI agents shadowed her in hopes of
identifying her Cuban contacts. But 10 days after the Sept. 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, perhaps
out of heightened concern about foreign enemies, they arrested her.</TE>
<TE>   Quoting an Italian proverb that "all the world is one country,"
Montes defended her actions Wednesday as a necessary antidote to the
40-year-old U.S. trade embargo against Cuba, imposed by President
Kennedy after the revolutionary Castro seized billions of dollars'
worth of U.S. assets. "I did what I thought was right to counter a
grave injustice," she said. "I hope my case in some way will
encourage our government to abandon its hostility toward Cuba."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Richard M. Urbina was not sympathetic,
although he did approve the plea bargain that, in return for her
cooperation, will likely keep Montes behind bars for at least 20
years. "If you cannot love your country, at least you should do it no
wrong," he said. "You decided to put the U.S. in harm's way. You must
pay the penalty."</TE>
<TE>   Montes, 45, took an all-American path to arrive at her moment of
ignominy. The oldest of four children, she was born on a U.S.
military base in Nuremberg, Germany, where her father was in the
Army. He was a psychoanalyst who had emigrated from his native Puerto
Rico to the United States in 1928 and attended medical school in
upstate New York.</TE>
<TE>   After moving to the Baltimore suburbs, Montes' father thrived in
private practice, and Montes became one of the first Latinos to
graduate from Loch Raven High School. In her yearbook, according to
the Miami Herald, she wrote that her favorite things were "summer,
beaches, soccer, Stevie W., P.R. [Puerto Rico], chocolate chip
cookies, having a good time with fun people."</TE>
<TE>   Montes' siblings have been fierce in their defense of her
patriotism. One of her brothers works for the FBI, as does her
sister, a translator who helped the FBI bring down the Wasp Network.
Prosecutors went out of their way, in a sentencing memo filed
recently, to say that Ana Belen Montes "brings shame to a family of
hard-working, loyal American citizens."</TE>
<TE>   The 25-year sentence -- negotiated by Washington lawyer Plato
Cacheris, who represented not only Ames and Hanssen but also former
White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky -- is about on par for female
spies. Ethel Rosenberg was the exception, executed for her role in
leaking nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   The handful of U.S. women convicted of espionage generally have
served prison time. Former Pentagon lawyer Theresa Maria Squillacote,
convicted in 1998 of spying for East Germany, was sentenced to 21
years. Rosario Ames, wife of the CIA's infamous double agent, was
sentenced in 1994 to more than five years. And in the first spy case
of the Cold War, former Justice Department employee Judy Coplon was
sentenced to 10 years in 1949 after her love affair and alleged
espionage with a Russian engineer.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), noting that some of Castro's
political prisoners have served "30 years for no crime except
speaking out for democracy," welcomed Montes' sentence. "I hope she
serves every one of those years," Ros-Lehtinen said.</TE>

<LD>PORTLAND, Ore. -- Muhammad Bilal was jailed earlier this month on
charges of plotting a terrorist war against the United States. His
sister says the only campaign Bilal was engaged in was a long
struggle to finish high school.</LD>
<LD>   His brother, Ahmed, would have been locked up that day, too, but
authorities said he had fled abroad and was a dangerous fugitive.
Their father says when he heard that Ahmed was wanted, he called his
student apartment in Malaysia. Ahmed not only answered the phone, he
followed his father's advice and turned himself in right away.</LD>
<LD>   The Bilals were indicted Oct. 3, along with four others, for
conspiring to fight in Afghanistan against the United States on the
side of Al Qaeda and the Taliban.</LD>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft called the Bilals and their cohorts a
"terrorist cell within our borders." But relatives say the Bilal
brothers were battling nothing more than dead-end jobs and failed
marriages.</TE>
<TE>   The conflicting portrayals of the Bilals underscore the split
between authorities and civil libertarians over the significance of
the Portland-based "cell." To one side, the group is a band of
fearsome terrorists; to the other, they may be victims of overeager
law enforcement and, at worst, revolutionary poseurs.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the confusion is a lack of information: Prosecutors say
much of the evidence in the case is secret until the trials, and
overwhelmed and mistrustful families of those arrested have said
little to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   But in a series of interviews last week, members of the Bilal
family ridiculed the notion that the brothers were secretly plotting
to kill Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "Their lives are as transparent as a pane of glass," said their
father, Ibrahim Bilal, an English teacher in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone told me the FBI followed my sons for a year," he said in
a telephone interview from his home. "That must have been boring,
like watching paint dry."</TE>
<TE>   The Bilals' mother, Jaleela Bilal, who also spoke by phone from
Saudi Arabia, denounced news accounts incorrectly identifying her
sons as Saudis. Though raised abroad, the Bilals are Americans with
roots in the San Francisco Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the brothers lived in the Portland area for most of the
last five years. Muhammad, now 22, came to Oregon in 1997, after
dropping out of his Saudi high school. Ahmed, 24, followed a year
later, the family said. The boys lived at first with their mother's
siblings, Robert and Carol Conger.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed and Muhammad showed little interest in religion, much less
jihad, Robert Conger recalled. Conger, 62, said his nephews "wanted
to be young Americans" after spending their teenage years in Saudi
Arabia. But the boys fell in for several months with a wild crowd --
what Conger called "American losers" -- interested mainly in drinking
and drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed and Muhammad returned to practicing Islam to distance
themselves from that group and sober up, Conger said. About three
years ago, they moved to separate apartments near the Congers.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad held a series of odd jobs and eventually went to work for
a general contractor who lives across the street from the Congers.
During a stint as a door-to-door salesman, Muhammad met a girl on his
sales route. The two married soon after and had a son, who is now 2.
She was 17, he was 19, relatives said. They divorced after about a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed taught at an Islamic school and later started a short-lived
lawn-care business. He married and divorced twice, relatives said.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, the brothers started on what would become an
ill-fated venture. The Bilals left Portland with Patrice Lumumba
Ford, 31, one of the six arrested. Although the three flew to Hong
Kong, the indictment alleges they were headed to Afghanistan, via
China and Pakistan, to fight for Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Family members say the Bilals took the trip not to engage in
combat, but to recover from domestic strife. Both had recently split
with their wives, said Royce McLemore, an aunt. "The boy was trying
to get over his wife kicking his booty," McLemore, 59, said of Ahmed.</TE>
<TE>   Their sister, Aisha Bilal, said her brothers timed their trip so
they could observe Ramadan in Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim
nation. She said her brothers have little knowledge of politics, and
that Muhammad was concerned more with Dragon Ball Z, a popular
cartoon featuring interplanetary superheroes, than world affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad returned to Portland last December and worked at a bagel
shop in the suburb of Hillsboro until August, when he left for
Michigan. There he lived with his sister Aisha's family and was
trying to complete his high school education. Ahmed remained abroad
to enroll at Islamic International University in Malaysia, a
12,000-student school known for its science and pre-professional
programs, the family said.</TE>
<TE>   McLemore said Bilal family members have taken long, impromptu
travels since 1973. That year, Art Foster Jr., as patriarch Ibrahim
Bilal was then known, decided to take his wife and three kids on a
journey to Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Conger said the trip might have been spurred by troubles
the family had as an interracial couple. "Artie" Foster, who is
African American, and Margaret Conger, who is white, were sweethearts
in the Tamalpais High School class of '63. She was the slightly
spoiled youngest daughter of a Mill Valley commercial fishing family.
He was a football, basketball and track star who had lived in the
Marin City housing projects.</TE>
<TE>   After Artie and Margaret married, Robert Conger said his parents
as well as the couple were subjected to insults from former friends
and neighbors in Mill Valley. "All of a sudden we saw our liberal
town was not so liberal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Ibrahim Bilal downplays the significance of racism at the
time. The family journey "was more of a latter-day hippie kind of
thing," he said. Bilal said his motives "were only as deep as my
pocketbook."</TE>
<TE>   Flying to Europe, the family bought a used Fiat van and set off
for Africa. Bilal said he quickly saw the van wasn't up to the task,
and went instead to Morocco. There he met a Muslim who inspired him
to convert.</TE>
<TE>   The family returned to the U.S. in 1974. Ibrahim Bilal completed a
law degree at the University of Santa Clara, but said he could not
reconcile what he sees as differences between the practice of law and
his faith.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, when Ahmed was 4 and Muhammad was 2, the family moved
from San Jose to Sudan, where they stayed for eight years. They then
moved to Saudi Arabia, where Ibrahim Bilal teaches English to Saudi
Airlines employees. In Saudi Arabia, Bilal took a second wife, who is
also an American expatriate. There are 16 Bilal children.</TE>
<TE>   The Bilals say they have retained their American identity in Saudi
Arabia. They live in an international compound, speak English at home
and visit the U.S. regularly. They are San Francisco 49er fans. When
Jaleela Bilal speaks of her sons' arrest, she refers to the U.S.
government and the West as "we" and "us." Believing that her sons
were targeted as Muslims, Bilal likened their plight to that of
Japanese Americans in World War II or victims of the McCarthy era.</TE>
<TE>   "History is repeating itself. It's not nice, but it's real and
something we have to address," Bilal said. "Who gives us the right to
destroy people's lives?"</TE>

<HD>CIA Chief Tenet Has Some Explaining to Do</HD>
<DH>With doubts about the effectiveness of the spy agencies
before 9/11, congressional investigators are due to quiz the director
today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- A few months before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks last
year, CIA Director George J. Tenet offered some words of wisdom to
the graduating class at Langley High School, a short distance from
the agency's headquarters in Virginia.</LD>
<LD>   "Bear down, persevere," he said. "I never had a plan in life
beyond doing the best that I could do in the job that I had. Somehow,
by doing that, the future took care of itself."</LD>
<LD>   More than a year later, the questions are whether the best Tenet
could do was good enough, and whether a man with such faith in the
future can navigate an increasingly perilous present.</LD>
<TE>   Tenet is due to appear on Capitol Hill today before congressional
investigators increasingly convinced that Sept. 11 was a monumental
intelligence failure.</TE>
<TE>   He is being whipsawed by the politics of a looming war with Iraq,
with some of his agency's assessments seemingly at odds with the
White House's.</TE>
<TE>   And after more than a year devoted to destroying Al Qaeda, the
terrorist network is resurgent, linked to a flurry of deadly new
strikes stretching from Yemen to Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   During his nearly six years on the job, Tenet has survived
everything from an administration change to assassination plots, and
there is reason to think he will survive these latest troubles.</TE>
<TE>   He remains close to President Bush, popular with agency employees
and on firm footing with key lawmakers, thanks to political savvy and
a disheveled but direct style that even many of his critics find
likable.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Tenet and congressional investigators have battled
over agency cooperation with the probe, and Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.),
chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the panel's final
report could contain criticism of Tenet.</TE>
<TE>   But Graham and Rep. Porter Goss (R-Fla.), chairman of the House
Intelligence Committee, both said one thing they won't do is call for
Tenet's removal. Said Goss, "I think he's doing a fine job."</TE>
<TE>   There have been persistent rumors in recent weeks on Capitol Hill
and among agency employees that Tenet intends to step down early next
year. But a senior CIA official brushed those rumors aside.</TE>
<TE>   "People have been predicting he's going to be stepping down soon
for the last four years," the official said. "I don't think he's
going to pass Richard Helms or Allen Dulles, but I'm pretty confident
he doesn't know when he'll move on."</TE>
<TE>   That Tenet is even in position to approach the lengthy tenures of
such CIA legends as Helms and Dulles--who held the job for seven and
nine years, respectively--is a testament to his survival instincts.</TE>
<TE>   It is all the more remarkable given that Tenet was never anyone's
first choice to be CIA director in the first place, and was widely
expected to be pushed aside by President Bush after the 2000
election.</TE>
<TE>   But even with a five-year track record, intelligence experts say
Tenet's legacy is very much a work in progress.</TE>
<TE>   "It's impossible to judge him now," said Thomas Powers, a frequent
writer on intelligence issues. "We don't know how [the war on
terrorism] is going to turn out and we don't know much about what
he's done until the present."</TE>
<TE>   Tenet, 49, has had undisputed successes.</TE>
<TE>   Well before Sept. 11, he brought stability and energy to a
once-demoralized agency, rebuilding the CIA's depleted clandestine
service and giving the agency renewed purpose after the end of the
Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   But Tenet's tenure has been marred by a series of intelligence
breakdowns and seeming helplessness against Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   The litany includes Al Qaeda's 1998 bombing of American embassies
in Africa and the bombing of the U.S. destroyer Cole in 2000. There
was also the failure to predict India's nuclear tests in 1998, and
the accidental U.S. bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   To critics, Sept. 11 was not an isolated catastrophe but the
culmination of a string of failures for which Tenet should be held
accountable.</TE>
<TE>   "When a ship runs aground that many times, the captain should step
down," said Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), vice chairman of the
Intelligence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet declined interview requests. In his few public statements
since the attacks, he has stressed that the agency has had successes
against Al Qaeda that the public may never know about because of
their clandestine nature.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews, dozens of current and former colleagues portrayed
Tenet as a gruff, garrulous man who is easy to underestimate and hard
not to like.</TE>
<TE>   With little concern for protocol, he will grab senators or foreign
dignitaries by the elbow to emphasize a point. And he salts his
briefings with swear words.</TE>
<TE>   His easy manner and agile mind have impressed a string of powerful
figures, including President Bush. Some see a preoccupation with
pleasing his bosses and a reluctance to take uncomfortable stands.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, many thought Tenet was catering to competing audiences
on Iraq. First he wrote a letter to lawmakers saying Saddam Hussein
was unlikely to attack the United States unless provoked. Then he
issued a second statement hours later supporting the White House
contention that Iraq poses an immediate threat.</TE>
<TE>   "George is not a visionary, he's an operator--a skilled, almost
hyperactive operator," said a former high-ranking CIA official who
worked closely with Tenet.</TE>
<TE>   "He has lasted as long as he has by meeting the expectations of a
very diverse set of interest groups."</TE>
<TE>   The son of Greek immigrants, Tenet grew up in Queens, N.Y., where
he worked at his parents' diner. After earning degrees in
international relations at Georgetown University and Columbia
University, he got a job on Capitol Hill as a legislative aide.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, then-Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) offered Tenet a job on
the Intelligence Committee he is scheduled to appear before today.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I got in a room with him, I was impressed by his
quickness of mind," Boren said. "I was also impressed with how direct
he was. You come to trust someone like that."</TE>
<TE>   When the job of Intelligence staff director opened in 1988, Boren
vaulted Tenet over a line of more experienced staffers. And when Bill
Clinton was elected president in 1992, Boren helped Tenet land a
position on Clinton's national security team.</TE>
<TE>   Many longtime CIA officers regard the Clinton era as the bleakest
in agency history. Budgets were slashed in the wake of the Cold War
and directors seemed to move through a revolving door.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, John Deutch resigned after little more than a year on the
job. Clinton's next nominee, National Security Advisor Tony Lake, was
blocked by Republicans. Tenet, by then deputy director, won the top
job by default.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet had never done spy work. But his stints on the Hill and in
the White House gave him a perspective on the politics and pitfalls
of the job that may have been more useful. Tenet traveled the world
with Boren, meeting the agency's overseas station chiefs and learning
how much behind-the-scenes muscle they wielded in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet courted the spies with symbolic steps, hanging a portrait of
Helms in his office suite and coaxing another agency legend--former
Moscow station chief Jack Downing--out of retirement to run the
clandestine service.</TE>
<TE>   He invited Helms, Downing and other former clandestine service
chiefs to regular dinners in the director's private dining room, a
tradition interrupted only briefly by Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Compared to the aloof Deutch, an MIT professor, Tenet related to
the rank and file. He chomped on cigars [unlit since a heart attack
in the early 1990s], cruised the hallways to say hello to analysts
and ate at the employee cafeteria. On Saturdays, he has been known to
stroll around the office in shorts and bare feet, bouncing a
basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "George is arguably the most popular director we've ever had,"
Downing, who has since re-retired, said in a recent interview. "As
great as Helms is, and I think the world of him, he's a much more
distant, forbidding figure. George is a very approachable guy."</TE>
<TE>   Many thought Tenet would be pushed out when Bush was elected. But
Tenet's down-to-earth persona made a quick impression on the
plain-spoken president-elect.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't hurt that Tenet had presided over the renaming of the
CIA's sprawling Langley campus as the George Bush Center for
Intelligence in 1999. The elder Bush was CIA director in the
mid-1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet is not seen as a power broker in the Bush White House, where
Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld
hold sway.</TE>
<TE>   But CIA directors measure their standing by their access to the
president. Tenet, who had infrequent face time with Clinton, briefs
Bush in person five or six mornings a week.</TE>
<TE>   In the months leading up to Sept. 11, amid a torrent of
intelligence traffic on Al Qaeda, Tenet is said to have behaved like
a man possessed.</TE>
<TE>   "He was running around buttonholing all of us, telling us there's
something going to happen," said Deputy Secretary of State Richard
Armitage.</TE>
<TE>   On the day of the attacks, Tenet was having breakfast in downtown
Washington with Boren.</TE>
<TE>   When an aide whispered in Tenet's ear that the World Trade Center
had just been hit, Boren recalled, Tenet declared: "This has Bin
Laden's fingerprints all over it," and raced back to the agency.</TE>
<TE>   But even if Tenet sounded early alarms on Bin Laden, it is still
unclear what he was doing to penetrate Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   In December 1998, Tenet wrote a memo declaring "war" on Al Qaeda.
"I want no resources or people spared in this effort," he told
subordinates.</TE>
<TE>   But congressional investigators found the follow-up wanting,
asserting that "there was no massive shift in budget or reassignment
of personnel to counterterrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also concluded that a major CIA blunder allowed two
of the Sept. 11 hijackers -- whom the agency had identified as Al
Qaeda terrorists in early 2000 -- to enter the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Some former CIA officials wonder whether Tenet ever made
penetrating Al Qaeda an overriding objective, the way cracking the
Kremlin was during the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   "If you recruited a Soviet spy, you got a triple promotion and you
were made for life," said Robert Baer, a former CIA case officer.
"Did Tenet in 1998 set the same standard for Bin Laden? If after 1998
you still got promoted by being an analyst or a desk officer, that's
a failure."</TE>
<TE>   Other agency veterans say whatever blame the CIA deserves for
Sept. 11, far more should be apportioned to the FBI, aviation
officials and an era of frivolous politics in Washington more focused
on scandals than national security.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem was not George Tenet," said R. James Woolsey,
Clinton's first CIA director. "It was that the country was on a beach
party from the end of the Cold War until Sept. 11."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>VILLANUEVA, N.M.</DL>
<LD>Vandals have destroyed statues and other religious articles in a
community grotto in this central New Mexico town.</LD>
<LD>   The Villanueva grotto -- an open-air hilltop shrine built in the
1950s by locals -- was a place of peace for area Roman Catholics
seeking to honor Our Lady of Guadalupe, considered the town
patroness.</LD>
<LD>   "Never have we seen such utter vandalism and sheer, utter hatred,"
said the Rev. Francis Malley, Catholic pastor for the surrounding
parish, as he stood near the wreckage.</LD>
<TE>   Wax from broken devotional candles melted in the sun and rosary
beads lay in the dirt as people visited the site Tuesday to see the
damage.</TE>
<TE>   Statues of Our Lady, St. Joseph and the infant Jesus at the shrine
also were smashed. A small wooden statue of San Isidro appeared
undamaged.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that it's empty," Celina Serna said as she wept at the
grotto. "Even from the road, you look up here now and it looks
empty."</TE>
<TE>   State police are investigating the vandalism, discovered Sunday.
The grotto is the focal point for the village's annual Aug. 15
celebration to honor Our Lady of Guadalupe.</TE>

<HD>Voting System Reform Bill OKd, Sent to Bush</HD>
<DH>Senate gives measure final approval despite some misgivings
among civil rights advocates. It authorizes $3.8 billion in federal
aid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved
legislation meant to improve the nation's election systems, clearing
it for President Bush's signature despite concerns among some civil
rights advocates that the measure could pose new obstacles to voting.</LD>
<LD>   The action, following a similar House vote last week, completes
the congressional drive to respond to the 2000 presidential election
controversy. Flaws in the machinery of American democracy were
exposed in that election, as the Florida recount made punch-card
ballots and "chads" infamous and left the contest between Bush and
Democrat Al Gore in limbo for more than a month.</LD>
<LD>   Bush announced after Wednesday's Senate vote that he will sign the
bill, confirming previous White House statements of support.</LD>
<TE>   "The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy," he said.
"I commend the House and Senate for passing legislation to improve
our election process."</TE>
<TE>   The bill would authorize more than $3.8 billion in federal aid
over three years to state and local election agencies -- a record.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said it would give Washington a "limited but responsible
role" in election reform.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the money would be distributed under a formula tied to
voting-age population, ensuring that California would be in line for
hundreds of millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate approved the bill 92 to 2. Only Sens. Charles E.
Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, both New York Democrats, were
opposed. Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, California
Democrats, voted for it.</TE>
<TE>   The House vote on Oct. 10 was 357 to 48.</TE>
<TE>   Some groups, led by Latino rights organizations, have protested
that the legislation would impose onerous identification requirements
on first-time voters that could keep people away from the polls.</TE>
<TE>   Under the bill, which takes effect for the 2004 election,
first-time voters who register by mail will need to provide a
current, valid photo identification -- such as a driver's license --
or a copy of a utility bill, bank statement, government check or some
other official document with a name and address.</TE>
<TE>   Failing that, a voter may supply a driver's license number, the
last four digits of a Social Security number or some other official
number kept in a state voter database. Voters whose credentials are
challenged also must be allowed to cast a provisional ballot that can
be verified later.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the requirements will prove intimidating and confusing
for some and are likely to thwart voting by new citizens --
especially members of ethnic minorities -- who lack a driver's
license or other acceptable ID.</TE>
<TE>   "We have never had a federally mandated identification
requirement," said Rep. Charlie Gonzalez (D-Texas), one of several
Latino House members who voted against the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "The question we have to ask is, why do we have it now?" Gonzalez
said. "It adds another obstacle, another condition. You will
disenfranchise people. There's no doubt in my mind."</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund issued a
statement sharply critical of the bill, which was negotiated by key
Republican and Democratic lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Latinos, especially young and elderly voters, are less likely to
have the various documents required under the provision," MALDEF
said.</TE>
<TE>   Latino rights advocates also are incensed by a provision of the
bill that requires states to set aside a voter's registration form if
the person fails to answer a specific question on U.S. citizenship.
Gonzalez said some legitimate voters might be left off voter rolls
for neglecting to check off a box.</TE>
<TE>   Some black lawmakers and African American rights groups also
criticized the ID requirement and citizenship check-off provision,
but most were persuaded in the end to support the bill. The National
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, for example, endorsed
it.</TE>
<TE>   The requirements were written into the bill at the insistence of
Republican negotiators as a way to deter voting fraud. Leading
Democrats, who accepted them reluctantly, stressed their belief that
the bill would expand voting guarantees, not restrict them.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a perfect bill, and the voter ID provision and
citizenship check-off box are not ones I would have wanted," said
Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), senior member of the Congressional
Black Caucus.</TE>
<TE>   "However, all things considered, this bill is an excellent first
step in protecting the cherished right to vote," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Schumer and Clinton disagreed, saying the bill could
disenfranchise thousands of New York voters.</TE>
<TE>   The bill contains several requirements that would reshape how many
states conduct voting.</TE>
<TE>   By 2004, states would be required to offer provisional balloting
to all voters -- a step meant to ensure that no one is turned away
from the polls who claims to be a valid voter. Eligibility claims
would be double-checked by election officials. California already has
taken this step, but recent surveys show many states have not.</TE>
<TE>   By 2006, states would be required to allow voters to verify their
choices on a ballot, notify them when they have voted for too many
candidates in a given contest and permit them to correct any
mistakes. States also would be required to set up at least one
polling station in each precinct that enables disabled voters to cast
ballots in privacy. And they would be required to use voting systems
that meet a minimum error rate set by the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Many lawmakers supported the bill enthusiastically because of its
promise of federal funding for cash-strapped election officials. At
least $650 million would be authorized immediately to help states
phase out punch-card and lever-machine voting, train poll workers and
take other steps to improve election systems.</TE>
<TE>   Another $3.2 billion would be authorized over three years to help
states with various election programs and to help them meet the
bill's requirements.</TE>
<TE>   However, Congress must still appropriate the money before states
receive any funds.</TE>

<HD>Mastectomy Not Necessary to Stop Cancer, 2 Studies Show</HD>
<DH>Removing small part of breast tissue is just as effective
as taking entire breast, researchers find.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rosie Mestel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Removing a small portion of breast tissue is just as effective as
removing the entire breast in saving the lives of women with breast
cancer, according to two studies published today.</LD>
<LD>   Several leading breast surgeons said that the reports, which
tracked 2,552 women over 20 years, further strengthen what many
scientists have long been saying: Mastectomies are not required in
the vast majority of breast cancer cases.</LD>
<LD>   Smaller operations, such as lumpectomies, which remove only the
cancer and surrounding tissue, are just as effective at saving lives
and halting the spread of cancer.</LD>
<TE>   "These papers are really the nail in the coffin for skeptics who
don't believe that breast preservation is as good as mastectomy for
the treatment of breast cancer," said Dr. Melvin J. Silverstein,
professor of surgery at USC's Keck School of Medicine and director of
the breast center at the school's Norris Cancer Center. "They show
you can do a little operation, save the breast and the end result in
terms of living and dying is the same."</TE>
<TE>   The studies, published in the New England Journal of Medicine,
were conducted by researchers in the U.S. and Italy.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. study, led by scientists at the University of Pittsburgh,
tracked 1,851 women with breast cancer who had been randomly assigned
to receive either a mastectomy, lumpectomy or lumpectomy followed by
radiation therapy. Twenty years later, the study found that all three
groups had indistinguishable rates of death and of the spread of
cancer to other areas of the body. After 20 years, about half of each
group were alive and free of cancer that had spread.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that radiation treatment after a lumpectomy
reduced the risk that the cancer would recur in the breast to 14.3%,
compared with 39% for lumpectomy alone.</TE>
<TE>   The second study, by scientists in Milan, Italy, involved 701
women and reached a similar conclusion on the relative merits of
mastectomy and a different breast-conserving procedure, called a
quadrantectomy.</TE>
<TE>   However, women with breast cancer often are not offered the choice
of breast-preserving surgery, noted Dr. Monica Morrow, professor of
surgery at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in
Chicago, in a commentary accompanying the reports.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, in a survey published in 2001, she and her
colleagues found that of 16,643 American women treated in 1994 for
cancers either confined to the breast or with lymph node involvement,
only 42.6% were treated with breast-conserving surgery.</TE>
<TE>   In another survey, 29% of 231 women who sought second opinions in
the years 1996 to 1999 were offered only a mastectomy at the first
consultations.</TE>
<TE>   "It is time to declare the case against breast-conserving surgery
closed," Morrow wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Breast-preserving surgery will never be possible for all women
with breast cancer, Silverstein said. Women who come to the clinic
when their tumors are too large and advanced will need more radical
surgery.</TE>

<KH>A FAN'S DIARY</KH>
<HD>In Angel Heaven With Grandpa</HD>
<DH>'Angel fandom, like any religion, is fundamentally about
loss.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joe Mathews</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was 6 when I saw my first baseball game. Grandpa Gerry drove the
two of us a mile down State College Boulevard from his house to
Anaheim Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   I remember watching Rod Carew, mostly a singles hitter, take
batting practice and bash long fly balls over the fence, out toward
the Orange Freeway. The stadium was open in the outfield then, and
the wind made for a chilly evening in the upper deck. I didn't care.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels shut out the Minnesota Twins, 5-0. And on that day in
July of 1979, Gerry became my favorite male relative (after all, my
bookish father had never managed to get me to a game), baseball my
favorite sport, and the Angels, for better and mostly worse, my
favorite team.</LD>
<TE>   Last Sunday, I sat in the upper deck and watched the Angels beat
the Twins again, this time to advance to their first World Series. A
few years ago, Disney demolished the outfield decks and opened up the
stadium again, and the breeze brought back 23 years of memories of a
team that has been defined by sadness and regret.</TE>
<TE>   For 41 years, Angel stories have been tales of the "not quite."
Not quite young enough or not quite experienced enough, not quite
deep enough in pitching or hitting, not quite American League
champions, and not quite Southern California's team.</TE>
<TE>   My Angel story is also about not quites.</TE>
<TE>   Gerry was not quite my grandfather.</TE>
<TE>   And the Angels were not quite my home team.</TE>
<TE>   Which is why I fell in love with them both.</TE>
<TE>   The son of Californians, I had moved at the age of 3 to China,
where my parents were foreign correspondents. My trip to the Big A
came on a summer visit to my grandmother, long since divorced from my
biological grandfather.</TE>
<TE>   Gerry had married my grandmother on Christmas Day seven years
earlier. I'm told now that he was a generous and decent man, a
heaven-sent catch for my grandmother, who was not always so lucky in
such things. All I knew then was that my own family cared little for
baseball, and that Gerry wasn't a blood relative.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a machinist and a seamstress, Gerald LeFrancois was in
his late 20s when he first left his native Rutland, Vt., for Orange
County. His first wife died young. He kept busy by devoting himself
to the Angels from the moment they moved to Anaheim from L.A. He
hated the Dodgers, God bless him. The Angels were always kind of a
second spouse to Angelenos, and Gerry resented all the attention and
season ticket buyers the Dodgers lured away from Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Gerry worked for years as a certified auto mechanic at a Chevrolet
dealership not far from the stadium. The job didn't pay enough for
season tickets, but he went to every game he could, usually taking my
grandmother, a co-worker or his son, Larry.</TE>
<TE>   In me, he found an eager convert. After the game, I peppered him
with questions about rules and statistics. Gerry, a fitness buff and
Jack La Lanne look-alike, told me that if I exercised hard, I might
play for the Angels some day.</TE>
<TE>   I flew back to Beijing that August wearing an Angels cap. I
started reading the International Herald Tribune to check the
abbreviated Angel box scores on the back page. When the Angels made
the 1979 playoffs, my father, at my urging, bought an enormous
shortwave radio so that, from across the world, I could have the
first of many experiences with October disappointment. The Angels
lost to the Orioles in four games.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, the only baseball to be had in China was the Wiffle
ball contests I organized in a parking lot next to the Forbidden
City. Convincing curious Chinese passersby to pitch, I imitated the
batting stance of Don Baylor (think Tim Salmon, with more power).
Throwing a ball in Tiananmen Square, I pretended I was Nolan Ryan.
(When the Angels let him go to Houston, I finally understood the
depths of the Chinese dismay with free markets.)</TE>
<TE>   The following year, we moved back to Southern California, where I
could pursue my love affair with baseball full time. I played through
high school and started coaching Little League, which I still do. But
Gerry never lived to take me to another game.</TE>
<TE>   The same year we moved back, he began to complain of headaches.
Brain cancer put him in the hospital. The exercises he insisted on
doing next to his hospital bed prompted a heart attack. He lasted
only through the Angel season, dying in late October. He was 57 years
old.</TE>
<TE>   Angel fandom, like any religion, is fundamentally about loss.
Longtime Angel fans can recite the litany by heart: the line drive
that cost Art Fowler the sight in his left eye; the brain tumor that
took Dick Wantz; the preseason car accidents that killed prospects
Bruce Heinbechner and Mike Miley; the shooting death of Lyman
Bostock; the suicide of Donnie Moore; the team bus crash that nearly
killed Buck Rodgers. On the field, there were any number of
late-season collapses that felt like funerals. In 1982 and 1986, the
Angels choked on the doorstep of the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   I suspect that a lot of people stay Angel fans out of devotion to
ghosts. For the living, it has been a lonely pursuit. After heading
East to attend college, I bought a ticket whenever the Angels came to
Boston or New York or Baltimore, and suffered the hecklers. Since
moving back home three years ago, I have driven down to Anaheim from
L.A. for half a dozen games a year, often alone.</TE>
<TE>   Over the bleak years, I learned to appreciate our losses, to hold
defeat close, to secretly celebrate last place in June, for it meant
no new heartbreak in October. This year, I bought playoff tickets
with no small amount of dread, not certain if I could stand having my
hopes trampled on again.</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, losing I had learned to handle. It was winning
that floored me.</TE>
<TE>   At my age, it feels childish to cry at a ballgame. But when Jackie
Autry presented the American League trophy to the Angels and talked
about her late husband, Gene, I immediately thought of my own Angel
ghost and the tears came.</TE>
<TE>   At a concession stand, I bought an $8 Angel flag attached to a
long stick. Leaving the stadium, my wife and I drove along State
College Boulevard, through my grandparents' old neighborhood and past
hundreds of cheering kids who had come out of their houses to show
off homemade banners and celebrate the victory.</TE>
<TE>   The cemetery is only two miles from the stadium. We parked at the
locked gate and climbed over the fence. I stuck the Angel flag in the
ground next to Grandpa Gerry's headstone.</TE>
<TE>   The graveyard was still, and as we turned to leave, I waved.
Suddenly the wind kicked up. And that flag waved back at us.</TE>
<TE>   The first of several occasional reports during the World Series.</TE>

<HD>Man Arrested in Threat on Reporter</HD>
<DH>He is accused of threatening a Times writer working on a
story about an alleged extortion plot against actor Steven Seagal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Marosi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A West Los Angeles man was charged Wednesday with threatening a Los
Angeles Times reporter working on a story about an alleged Mafia
extortion plot against actor Steven Seagal.</LD>
<LD>   Alexander Proctor, 58, was being held without bail in a downtown
federal detention center after he was arrested outside his home.</LD>
<LD>   Proctor, authorities allege, broke the reporter's car window and
left a package containing a dead fish with a long-stemmed rose in its
mouth.</LD>
<TE>   A cardboard placard with the word "STOP" was affixed to her car,
parked near her Los Angeles home, according to the indictment by a
federal grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   The threats, authorities allege, were meant to intimidate Anita M.
Busch in an effort to stop her from reporting the story.</TE>
<TE>   "The only word he used was stop," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Daniel
Saunders, the lead prosecutor. "I think it's pretty clear."</TE>
<TE>   The incident occurred in June, a few weeks into Busch's reporting.
The Times published several stories that month about the arrest of
Seagal's former partner for his alleged role in a multimillion-dollar
extortion scheme against the actor by the Gambino crime family.</TE>
<TE>   A second reporter on the Seagal story, the author of a Vanity Fair
article, told police he was threatened at gunpoint outside his Los
Angeles home in late August.</TE>
<TE>   FBI spokeswoman Laura Bosley did not rule out the possibility of
more arrests.</TE>
<TE>   David Garcia, a spokesman for The Times, said the newspaper is
"very pleased with the announcement of today's arrest. The safety of
our reporter has always been our greatest concern."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors described Proctor as an ex-convict with burglary and
narcotics-related convictions. The organized-crime units of the FBI
and Los Angeles Police Department are continuing to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   Proctor, wearing wire-rim glasses and a black sweater, listened
attentively as he was denied bail by U.S. Magistrate Ralph Zarefsky.
The judge cited Proctor's criminal record and the nature of the
threats.</TE>
<TE>   Proctor is scheduled to be arraigned Monday morning. His attorney,
Victor Cannon, was not available for comment. If convicted of
violating the statute -- interference with commerce by threats of
violence -- he could be sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in prison.</TE>

<HD>Teen Found Guilty of Murder in Beating Death of Transient</HD>
<DH>Jury rules that the attack on the homeless man as he lay in
a sleeping bag near the beach in Ventura was premeditated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oak View teen was convicted of first-degree murder and robbery
Wednesday after a jury found that he deliberately beat and kicked a
homeless man to death last year, after stealing the transient's few
possessions.</LD>
<LD>   After four days of deliberation, jurors rejected defense arguments
that 19-year-old Robert Coffman never intended to kill homeless Army
veteran James Clark, 58, when he and three other teens assaulted the
man as he lay in a sleeping bag near the beach in Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorneys conceded that Coffman participated in the
attack. But they argued the evidence of premeditation was weak and
urged jurors to find Coffman guilty of second-degree murder, which
carries a reduced sentence.</LD>
<TE>   As they filed into court Wednesday evening, a few jurors glanced
at Coffman before taking their seats. One female juror dabbed tears
from her eyes as Superior Court Judge Ken Riley read the verdicts.
The panel of five men and seven women left the courthouse under
police escort and declined to talk about the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they did the right thing," said Tom Clark, the victim's
nephew. "This didn't just happen. He purposely did this."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Stacy Ratner said the jury ultimately adopted her
theory of the case, but worked hard for days before reaching a
consensus. They asked questions and requested that the testimony of
several witnesses be read back before the verdicts were announced. In
addition to murder and robbery, Coffman was found guilty of attempted
murder in connection with the stabbing of 19-year-old Daniel McGrath
at the Ventura beachfront promenade a day after Clark's slaying on
June 30, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The jury also returned special findings that Coffman used a knife
and inflicted great bodily injury. According to court testimony,
McGrath was walking with his ex-girlfriend when three teens,
including Coffman, confronted him and started a fight. McGrath was
stabbed five times in the chest, arm and back.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very brutal situation," McGrath said Wednesday, standing
outside the courtroom after the verdicts were announced. "He deserves
the time. I personally did not do anything wrong and neither did Mr.
Clark."</TE>
<TE>   Coffman, a tall, dark-haired teen whom prosecutors portrayed as a
violent white supremacist, faces a life prison term when sentenced
Nov. 15.</TE>
<TE>   The defendant showed no emotion and stared straight ahead as the
verdicts were read.</TE>
<TE>   Coffman's mother wept and cried out, "Robert, I love you!" as he
was led to a holding cell.</TE>
<TE>   Coffman remains jailed without bail.</TE>
<TE>   As he left the courthouse, defense attorney James Farley said
Coffman knows his actions were wrong and is remorseful. He said
Coffman has also accepted his punishment. The teen will not be
eligible for parole until age 59.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame that his life was thrown away on these two
incidents," Farley said. "He understands exactly the situation he is
in, and he is ready to pay for the wrongdoing he has done."</TE>
<TE>   The slaying of Clark occurred after a group of teens stumbled over
the sleeping transient as they headed to a beach party near Surfers
Point in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   The teens allegedly stole Clark's backpack and a jar of pennies,
then kicked and stoned him. According to testimony, Coffman told
friends that he later returned and kicked the injured man a second
time, remarking that he was going to "give him a deeper sleep,"
according to testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Clark died after suffering multiple blunt-force injuries,
including a crushed kidney, a broken rib and a possible skull
fracture.</TE>
<TE>   Police later arrested Coffman, Rocky Mattley, Timothy Becker and
Christopher Dunham. During police interviews, Coffman admitted
kicking "a bum" and described how the others participated in the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County prosecutors charged all four suspects with murder
but decided to prosecute Mattley in Juvenile Court because he was 14
at the time of the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Mattley was convicted of second-degree murder and is serving time
in the California Youth Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Becker and Dunham, both 19 of Ventura, are awaiting trial.</TE>

<HD>Extortion Plot Ended in Death, Authorities Say</HD>
<DH>Man is sought for allegedly trying to squeeze money from a
felon who was violating his probation, and then fatally shooting him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police are searching for a man suspected of extorting
money from a convicted felon over his probation violations, then
fatally shooting the victim in his North Hollywood home.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives released a composite sketch Wednesday of the man
believed responsible for the Sept. 6 slaying of Artak Jragatsbanyan,
26. They are concerned the suspect may have been involved in other
shakedowns targeting ex-cons.</LD>
<LD>   Jragatsbanyan pleaded guilty to federal health-care fraud charges
in April and was serving 10 months at a Hollywood halfway house,
which he was allowed to leave only to go to work or church.</LD>
<TE>   But Jragatsbanyan was worried about his pregnant wife, Ani, and
would sneak over to his family's North Hollywood bungalow for visits,
police said. When the suspect learned of Jragatsbanyan's actions, he
extorted hundreds of dollars from him by threatening to tell
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect posed as an investigator for the halfway house,
although police said he was not an employee there. He apparently
never met Jragatsbanyan before he began demanding money from him.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to find out how this guy hooked up with
[Jragatsbanyan]," Det. Tim Shaw said. "We're also trying to find how
he came up with this information."</TE>
<TE>   The suspect was last seen driving away from Jragatsbanyan's home
on the morning of the slaying in a silver or gray Ford sedan,
possibly a Thunderbird or Taurus, police said.</TE>
<TE>   He is described as a 6-foot, 200-pound African American between 26
and 38 years old, with a goatee surrounded by stubble. He was wearing
a baseball cap, a long-sleeve jacket and blue jeans.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect met with Jragatsbanyan several times beginning in
August, Shaw said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said it's not clear how their relationship began.</TE>
<TE>   But Ani Jragatsbanyan said the suspect knew too much about her
husband, and the halfway house's rules.</TE>
<TE>   "He had followed my husband," she said. "He'd tell him where he'd
walked, where he'd gotten into his car. My husband really thought
this guy was an investigator. He knew he had made a violation, so he
fell for this."</TE>
<TE>   Jragatsbanyan, who had been working as an apprentice plumber since
his guilty plea, may not have paid as much as the man demanded, Det.
Dwain Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   On the morning of Sept. 6, the suspect went to the bungalow and
shot Jragatsbanyan several times in the torso, police said. Shaw said
Ani Jragatsbanyan had stepped out to run some errands.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents, Jragatsbanyan, the former owner of
Golden Age Medical Supply in Los Angeles, defrauded the state of
$353,000 in a Medi-Cal billing scam.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives ask anyone with information about the slaying to call
(818) 623-4075 or, after hours, (818) 623-4016.</TE>

<HD>Help Promised on College Aid Forms</HD>
<DH>L.A. will guide high school seniors and their parents in
providing financial information.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Silverstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A citywide effort is being launched to counsel high school seniors
and their parents on how to fill out college financial forms, a
challenging task believed to keep some low-income and immigrant
students from continuing their educations.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor James K. Hahn will announce the initiative today; it
includes plans to recruit hundreds of volunteers from local
accounting firms, banks and other businesses, along with college
financial aid specialists.</LD>
<LD>   The central event in the program is scheduled for Feb. 1-2, when
the volunteers are to spend the weekend providing counseling at about
50 high schools in the L.A. Unified district.</LD>
<TE>   During the rest of February, city employees trained to provide
help with financial aid forms will be available at community centers
throughout Los Angeles for people who can't attend the weekend
program or who need follow-up assistance.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a College and Career Convention will be held Nov. 7-9
at the Los Angeles Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative is intended to help students and their parents
accurately complete the detailed college aid forms known as FAFSA.
Many higher education experts say that chore can be so difficult for
families that aren't financially savvy that they make errors that
prevent their children from qualifying for grants and scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas J. Kane, a professor of policy studies and economics at
UCLA who develped the idea for the program, cited the difficulties of
low-income students seeking to become the first in their families to
attend college. "It may be exactly the people whose college decisions
are most likely to be affected by the availability of financial aid
who would have the most difficulty filling out the forms," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kane said the forms for FAFSA -- which stands for Free Application
for Federal Student Aid -- are more complicated than tax forms
because "there are all sorts of additional questions about family
composition and students' own income, students' own assets and
parents' assets that aren't required on the federal tax form."</TE>
<TE>   He added that there is a "big industry for helping fill out tax
forms" but much less help for students and families trying to fund
their education.</TE>
<TE>   According to a study released in June by a federal advisory group,
52% of qualified students from families with incomes below $25,000
advance to four-year colleges. The percentage was 84% among qualified
students from families with incomes exceeding $75,000.</TE>
<TE>   The "Free Cash for College Weekend" is intended to familiarize
high school seniors and their parents with the variety of available
college scholarships and loans.</TE>
<TE>   Joy Y. Chen, the deputy mayor spearheading the program for Hahn,
said students from affluent families sometimes rely on private
counselors to provide information on colleges and advice on paying
for school.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't have a private college counselor at your beck and
call, here we're mobilizing the community to provide some of that
service for you," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In part, the "Free Cash" weekend is timed to meet the March 2
deadline to apply for the state's Cal Grant aid program. That
program, which generally focuses on students on the bottom half of
the income scale, was expanded dramatically in 2000 to make it more
widely available.</TE>
<TE>   Chen, the deputy mayor in charge of work force development, said
the city initiative could encourage more students to apply for Cal
Grant funds. State officials have been disappointed with the low
level of applications for the grants since the program was expanded
two years ago to include every state high school graduate with at
least a C average who can show financial need.</TE>

<HD>Restaurant Grades Get High Marks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Cara Mia DiMassa and Carol Chambers</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More consumers are aware of the Los Angeles County health
department's system for rating restaurants with a letter grade than
they are of its alcohol abuse or bioterrorism preparedness programs,
according to the results of a survey released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The 4-year-old system is also apparently having a significant
impact on local dining habits, with 88% of those surveyed saying they
would eat at a restaurant posting an A grade, but only 25% saying
they would eat at one with a B.</LD>
<LD>   A mere 3% of the 2,000 consumers questioned by the Department of
Health Services said they would eat at one of the 580 restaurants
countywide that earned a C or lower.</LD>
<TE>   Restaurants appear to be getting the message.</TE>
<TE>   About 83% of the 36,000 restaurants in the county received an A
last year. Only 52% did as well when the program began in 1997, said
county health director Jonathan Fielding.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think of a more popular government program," he said.
"Consumers are rating it a big success, and they're voting with their
feet."</TE>
<TE>   That's not entirely true.</TE>
<TE>   The big red C in a plastic pouch posted above the counter at
Pipiripau Tacos in Burbank didn't bother co-owner Rebecca Sanchez or
her stream of customers Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "One time I told a customer it stands for Christ so they wouldn't
bug me about it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Customer Luky Sanchez, no relation, also dismissed the poor grade,
saying, "We love this place," as she finished a beef taco and ordered
a bag of burritos, tortas and more tacos to go.</TE>
<TE>   Then she ordered one more beef taco for "my baby," a 6-month-old
Rottweiler waiting in the car, which dispatched it in two bites.</TE>
<TE>   For 91% of those surveyed, however, letter grades matter.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't eat anywhere that's not an A," said Pamela Gibberman,
48, of Panorama City as she and her husband Jay, 49, strode beneath
the bright green awning of California City Buffet in Northridge on
Wednesday evening to attend a meeting -- but not to eat.</TE>
<TE>   A red C was posted to the left of the front door. A day earlier,
health officials had lowered the rating from a B when they saw an
employee wash his hands at the wrong kitchen basin.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't see it posted, we ask," Pamela Gibberman said. Added
her husband, "We've walked out of places because the grade was too
low."</TE>
<TE>   Behind them was Deanna Rabang, 30, and her friend Mary Ochoa, 28,
both of Van Nuys, who were more forgiving. While they usually tend to
avoid C restaurants, they liked this place so much Saturday, when it
was still rated B, that they came back.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was really bad, they'd shut it down," Ochoa said.</TE>
<TE>   That's what happened at Billy Boy's Cafe in Pearblossom six weeks
ago after health officials said they discovered too many cockroaches,
no hot water, and fries on the freezer floor.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Robert Winton said he wouldn't argue with most of the
findings that earned his restaurant a rating of 59%.</TE>
<TE>   (Restaurants that rate below a C are assigned a percentage number
instead, starting with 69. Any rated below 60 run the risk of being
shut down, county officials said.)</TE>
<TE>   Winton said the system was good except "when they start nitpicking
about every little thing."</TE>
<TE>   "Our motto is great food and lots of it," he said, "and we have a
great reputation, so we're going to bounce back."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, he said, the owners are spending an estimated
$30,000 to $40,000 on upgrades.</TE>

<HD>Illegal Dumping Alleged at Plant</HD>
<DH>Prosecutors contend an Oxnard metal recycler improperly
disposed of used motor oil for years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State and local prosecutors have filed a civil complaint against an
Oxnard metal recycler, alleging that workers for years had illegally
dumped and burned motor oil at the plant perched on the edge of the
pristine Ormond Beach wetlands.</LD>
<LD>   The Ventura County district attorney's office and the state
attorney general accuse Halaco Engineering of violating California
law by adding used motor oil to scrap metal materials that were then
run through industrial washers and burned in the company's furnace.</LD>
<LD>   During the washing process, some oil was flushed into settling
ponds on Halaco's property, prosecutors allege. Oil also stuck to the
materials that were burned, raising concerns about air pollution.</LD>
<TE>   While company officials halted the practice shortly after it was
brought to their attention in 2000, prosecutors want a permanent
injunction barring such disposals.</TE>
<TE>   They also are seeking to fine the company an undetermined amount
for its alleged past misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "Oil is a regulated waste under California law, and you just can't
dump it on the ground or burn it in a furnace," Deputy Dist. Atty.
Mitchell Disney said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney David Shemano, who is handling a bankruptcy
petition filed by Halaco this summer, said the company disputes that
there was ever anything illegal or improper about its motor oil
disposal.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Shemano said company officials agreed more than two years
ago to change practices to avoid a dispute with the district
attorney's office. He said Wednesday's action took him by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's important to point out that they are not alleging
that we are doing anything improper right now," Shemano said. "We are
looking forward to working with them to resolve their concerns as
quickly as we can."</TE>
<TE>   The civil action, which stemmed from a 1999 inspection by the
Oxnard Fire Department, is the latest in a series of regulatory and
legal tangles for Halaco.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the state's Regional Water Quality Control
Board ordered the metal recycler to stop the soupy discharges that
since 1970 have yielded a 40-foot-high slag heap. The discharges, are
to end by December and the slag heap must be removed within 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which has said it will have to spend more than $1
million to meet the agency's long list of technical requirements, has
filed for bankruptcy protection to be able to comply with the water
board's order.</TE>
<TE>   Halaco also has been sued by the Environmental Defense Center and
the citizens group ChannelKeeper. The lawsuit accuses Halaco of
polluting the air and nearby wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Krop, chief counsel for the Environmental Defense Center,
said she would like to see an investigation into whether motor oil
seeped into the groundwater or the wetlands.</TE>

<HD>Surf City Awash in Budget and Pollution Issues</HD>
<DH>In a race focusing on Huntington's economic woes, 18
candidates are up for four council seats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Phil Willon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a time when Huntington Beach is facing some big-city growing
pains, voters in Surf City are being asked to reshape a City Council
that has four of its seven seats up for grabs in November.</LD>
<LD>   Once elected, the newcomers will have the task of guiding a city
that has suffered two straight years of budget cuts and has been
hamstrung by beach pollution that hurt the tourist economy.</LD>
<LD>   Among the 18 candidates on the ballot are former Huntington Beach
Mayor Dave Sullivan; a vocal environmental activist; and Kathleen
Mello-Navejas, a former mayor of Hawaiian Gardens who was recalled in
1997 after she fought a voter-approved card club.</LD>
<TE>   Others include a local sportswear manufacturer who goes by the
nickname Firecracker, two high school teachers and the wife of a
council member whose term ends this year.The city has been forced to
cut its annual budget by about $7 million each of the last two years
because of shortfalls, and the situation for next year "looks just as
bleak," said Mayor Debbie Cook, who is not up for reelection this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan said the city could save a bundle of money by cutting
back benefits for city employees -- especially the city's "top shelf"
health insurance policy that's provided without employees paying any
share of the premiums.</TE>
<TE>   "Wages and benefits are excessive," Sullivan said. "Millions are
being diverted from other necessary projects because of that."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan, who served on the council from 1992 to 2000, helped
eliminate the practice of what he called "salary spiking" among city
employees, the practice of increasing salaries shortly before
retirement to hike pension benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Joey Racano, a founding member of the Ocean Outfall
Group, is calling himself the "clean-water candidate." "Without clean
water, Huntington Beach really doesn't have any other issues," said
Racano, one of 16 candidates who appeared at a forum last week
sponsored by the League of Women Voters. Racano, a musician, also
wants to establish a world-class recycling program and require the
city to use clean-air cars.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate broker Keith Bohr said keeping Huntington Beach's
coast pollution-free is critical for the health of the tourism
industry. Candidate Stephen Garcia agreed and echoed the sentiments
of many candidates in saying that the city should not have to tackle
the problem by itself.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a regional problem; it's not just our problem," said
Garcia, an accountant. "We have to get the state involved in this."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the candidates also stressed that the city needs to do
more to attract tax-revenue-producing businesses but were less
forthright about how to lure such companies from other nearby cities.</TE>
<TE>   No matter who is elected next month, they'll quickly find out
there are no easy solutions, said Mayor Cook, whose term lasts until
2004.</TE>

<HD>Horse Owners Lobby Council</HD>
<DH>They complain that city laws regarding their animals are
restrictive and often contradictory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Wendy Thermos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're not a horse owner, the sight of a 1,000-pound animal in
your neighbor's yard, creating dust and manure, may be upsetting.</LD>
<LD>   But if you live in an equine-zoned area of Los Angeles and have a
horse on your property, you're not likely to be sympathetic to your
neighbor's complaints.</LD>
<LD>   The conflict has sparked an uprising among equestrian property
owners in the San Fernando Valley who feel city horse-keeping laws
are so restrictive and contradictory that their rural way of life is
in danger of vanishing from L.A.</LD>
<TE>   About 250 horse owners spent more than three hours Tuesday night
telling a City Council committee that their rights are being eroded
by developers who buy up lots in their neighborhoods to build houses
for people who object to barnyard creatures.</TE>
<TE>   They received support for their cause from Councilwoman Wendy
Greuel, who, as a member of the planning and land-use committee,
requested the hearing held in Tujunga.</TE>
<TE>   "The current regulatory structure is a threat to horse-keeping
rights," she said Wednesday. "If someone doesn't have a horse for a
year ... they can lose the right to have horses permanently."</TE>
<TE>   Bart Paul, a horse owner and Lake View Terrace resident, said
government regulations are a nightmare for horse property owners, who
live mainly in Chatsworth, Shadow Hills, Tujunga and the Hansen Dam
area.</TE>
<TE>   "If you ask how far you have to keep your horse from a dwelling,
the animal control department might say one thing, building and
safety might say something else, and the health department might say,
'We trump everyone,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said she will ask the full council next week to back her
plan for a land-use permit to preserve horse-keeping rights.</TE>
<TE>   In equestrian-zoned areas, property owners who don't keep horses
have put landscaping across horse trails. "We need to take
enforcement action there," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel wants the distance required between horses and dwellings to
be standardized, and will also seek a requirement that horse rights
be recorded with deeds and disclosed when property changes hands.</TE>
<TE>   Horse owners said they belatedly have learned that if they don't
license their animals with the city's Department of Animal
Regulation, their property technically doesn't have a horse on it.
Planning Department officials can then issue permits to build on
adjacent lots and owners of equestrian-zoned parcels are barred from
having stock animals because of nearby dwellings.</TE>
<TE>   Paul said many horse owners don't get licenses because they fear
scrutiny from city building inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   "There are thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of horses in the
Valley," he said. "The city believes there are only a few hundred."</TE>
<TE>   Many horse owners have used the rights issue as an example of why
the Valley should break away from Los Angeles and form its own city,
Paul said.</TE>
<TE>   "But a lot of us feel that you'd still have the same developers
eyeing the same pieces of property," he said, "and it'd be business
as usual."</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Native Appointed to Superior Court</HD>
<DH>Gov. Davis names Manuel J. Covarrubias to post created by
Legislature in 2001. Move is applauded by legal community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson and Holly J. Wolcott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A longtime court commissioner and former poverty law attorney was
appointed Wednesday to the Ventura County Superior Court by Gov. Gray
Davis.</LD>
<LD>   Manuel J. Covarrubias, a 50-year-old Oxnard resident born and
raised in the city, fills a position created by the Legislature in
January 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Covarrubias becomes the county's 27th Superior Court judge and its
second Latino jurist, joining Judge Arturo F. Gutierrez, who has
served on the bench for more than 20 years.</LD>
<TE>   Sitting in court chambers Wednesday afternoon, Covarrubias said he
had long aspired to be a Superior Court judge.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very satisfying to reach a personal goal," Covarrubias said.
"It's just elating."</TE>
<TE>   One of nine children and the first in his family to graduate from
college, Covarrubias described his new job as an "awesome task" with
a great amount of responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   He began his career as a legal aid attorney and later opened his
own practice as a civil and family law attorney.</TE>
<TE>   For the last eight years, he has served as a full-time court
commissioner presiding over family law, small claims and traffic
matters.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Superior Court judges who preside over trials and other
matters, court commissioners are selected by the county's sitting
judges to hear limited types of cases, such as traffic and
misdemeanor matters.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge David W. Long, also a former court
commissioner, said Covarrubias had been a reliable commissioner and
will make an excellent judge.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm absolutely thrilled," Long said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys across the county praised Davis, not only for bringing
greater diversity to the bench, but also for picking someone with a
rich background in civil litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a bench that has been historically laden with former
district attorneys who are fine judges, but when it comes to civil
cases there has been a learning curve," said Oxnard attorney Oscar C.
Gonzalez, a former officer for the California La Raza Lawyers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez, who met Covarrubias more than 15 years ago through their
memberships with the county's Mexican-American Bar Assn., said the
new judge is a "fine attorney, a fine commissioner and will be a fine
judge."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Henderson, executive director of the Ventura County Bar
Assn., called the appointment well-deserved. He said Covarrubias is
highly regarded in the Ventura County legal community.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Harrington, past president of the Ventura County Bar Assn.,
said Covarrubias' judicial temperament makes him an excellent choice
for the position.</TE>
<TE>   "He runs a very comfortable courtroom. He is decent and
respectful," said Harrington, a Ventura attorney. "He keeps people as
relaxed as he can, and they know that fairness and justice are taking
place."</TE>
<TE>   Carmen Ramirez, a former poverty lawyer who runs the Superior
Court's self-help legal center in Oxnard, has known Covarrubias more
than 20 years, since they met at a legal aid office.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a wonderful person and will be a great judge for the entire
community," Ramirez said. "It is really important that the
institutions reflect the community, and it's been decades since a
Latino was appointed. This is good."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's population is about one-third Latino, and that
share is increasing.</TE>
<TE>   Covarrubias began his legal career in 1978 as a legal aid attorney
with Channel Counties Legal Services. In 1981 he opened his own law
office in Oxnard, practicing family law, misdemeanor criminal defense
and civil litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Covarrubias graduated from Oxnard High School, earned a bachelor's
degree from Cal State Northridge and a law degree from Loyola Law
School.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife, Audrey, have three children, ages, 22, 21 and 17.
In his free time, Covarrubias enjoys carpentry and gardening.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, he said couldn't wait to tell his parents -- a
retired union carpenter and homemaker -- of his appointment.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been trying to reach them," Covarrubias said. "I'm sure
they'll be elated."</TE>

<HD>Annexation of 441 Acres for RiverPark Development OKd</HD>
<DH>State panel's action appending land to Oxnard is final
major hurdle for the $750-million mini-city project.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state planning group Wednesday approved annexation of 441 acres of
county land to the city of Oxnard for the construction of RiverPark,
a $750-million mini-city that represents the largest mixed-use
project in Ventura County history.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by the Local Agency Formation Commission to annex the
remainder of the 701-acre development to Oxnard was the project's
last major hurdle before developers can break ground.</LD>
<LD>   Approvals and permits will now come from the Oxnard City Council,
which has already approved the project.</LD>
<TE>   The city, however, must meet several conditions before it can
claim the former sand and gravel mine area as its own, LAFCO
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the conditions mandates that Oxnard ante up $500,000 to
ensure the preservation of ground water. The city must also file a
request to annex a 35-acre residential area in El Rio.</TE>
<TE>   Everett Millais, executive officer of LAFCO, said support for
annexation was unanimous; city leaders, developers and local school
officials all spoke in favor of the project, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There really wasn't any controversy," Millais said. "From my
experience with developments even close to this size, there are
always a whole lot of issues, but all of those issues have been
resolved to pretty much everyone's satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   "The city and developer have really done their homework."</TE>
<TE>   The RiverPark development, at the intersection of the Ventura
Freeway and Pacific Coast Highway, calls for about 2,800 living units
centered on village greens. It would also include a vintage town
square, a movie theater and restaurants, a first-class hotel and
convention center, three schools, sports fields and a food-and-wine
exposition.</TE>
<TE>   "This will bring all kinds of benefits to Oxnard and will really
help change the image of the city," Mayor Manuel Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   For a project of its size, RiverPark has run into little
opposition, mainly because developers have given most of the affected
parties exactly what they want.</TE>
<TE>   The local school districts will get three new schools; affordable
housing advocates will receive 15% of the project's dwellings for
low- and very-low-income households; and environmentalists say the
project might boost ground water supplies.</TE>
<TE>   RiverPark's partners -- including a $12-billion pension investment
fund, a noted Los Angeles builder and the county's top real estate
deal-maker -- say they have agreed to spend $99 million in upfront
costs on schools, off-site roads, El Rio storm drains, relocation of
a county maintenance yard and construction of a new fire station, to
be operated jointly by the city and county.</TE>
<TE>   "This is extraordinary," Rio School District Supt. Yolanda Benitez
said. "As soon as the community is built, they'll have their schools
as opposed to waiting for the state to build. That's the way to do
it."</TE>
<TE>   Developers hope to break ground by late summer and open the first
of five phases for occupancy by early 2004, after construction of a
new freeway interchange and the widening of the adjacent Santa Clara
River bridge.</TE>

<HD>City Settles LAPD Officer's Lawsuit for $1.25 Million</HD>
<DH>The sergeant alleged she was demoted after complaining
about a superior's insults.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles police sergeant who was transferred and demoted after
she complained about insulting remarks she said a superior officer
made to her has won a $1.25-million settlement from the city.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council on Wednesday approved the payment to Diane
Tostado, 45, on a vote of 10 to 1, on the recommendation of the city
attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   According to Tostado's lawsuit, she had been an officer for nearly
14 years, promoted twice and holding the post of assistant watch
commander in the Wilshire Division. She alleged that a newly arrived
superior, Lt. Andrew Monsue, told her in 1998 that he was opposed to
affirmative action policies, believed that they resulted in
undeserved promotions of women of color like her, and that he cared
only for the fortunes of white men.</LD>
<TE>   Tostado said in the lawsuit that she complained about the comments
to the then-commanding officer of the division, Capt. David Powers.
Rather than respond, she alleged, he began to criticize her work.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, she alleged, she has suffered emotionally and hasn't
worked since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Monsue has since been transferred and is working in the
detectives' branch of the LAPD's Central Division. Powers has
retired. Neither was available for comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   But Cheryl Wilson, chief of civil liability management for the
city attorney's office, said the city litigators concluded that if
the case had gone to trial, Tostado could have won substantially more
than $1.25 million.</TE>
<TE>   "She had received good work performance ratings before these
events," Wilson said. "Afterwards, there was an immediate change."</TE>
<TE>   The only council member to vote against the settlement, Nate
Holden, said, "It's $1.25 million to a lady who claimed a guy didn't
talk to her nicely."</TE>
<TE>   Tostado's attorney, Dan Stormer, said she is broke and living with
her mother.</TE>

<HD>Poll Takes Steam Out of Valley Mayoral Race</HD>
<DH>Candidates in a tight contest struggle for attention as
hopes for secession dim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the election less than three weeks away, candidates for mayor of
a proposed San Fernando Valley city are struggling to capture the
voters' attention, and some say the fading prospects of secession
itself will make it difficult for them to raise money and enlist
volunteers for the homestretch.</LD>
<LD>   A new Los Angeles Times Poll found that more than two-thirds of
likely Valley voters were still undecided about which of the 10
mayoral candidates to support. Assemblyman Keith Richman
(R-Northridge) led the field, with the backing of just 13% of those
surveyed.</LD>
<LD>   And while the poll results gave hope to the other candidates that
the election is anyone's to win, they also were seen as a grim
indication that voters have little interest in the race, perhaps
because the Valley mayor's office will not exist if secession loses.</LD>
<TE>   The Times Poll found Valley secession was losing by a 2-1 margin
citywide and trailing narrowly in the Valley. To win, the Nov. 5
breakup measure must receive a majority of the votes in the Valley
and Los Angeles as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm losing confidence," said mayoral candidate Leonard Shapiro.
"This thing will win big in the Valley, but it will lose in the whole
city."</TE>
<TE>   The lackluster nature of the mayoral campaign was apparent
Wednesday when only five candidates showed up for a forum at the
Woodland Hills Chamber of Commerce, and most of the audience left
before they spoke.</TE>
<TE>   One of the candidates at the forum, insurance adjuster David
Hernandez Jr., who placed second in the poll with the support of 5%
of likely voters, tried to put a positive spin on the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, people are realizing that the most significant
thing since water in the San Fernando Valley is about to take place
in 20 days," said Hernandez, who is simultaneously campaigning for a
seat in Congress. "The sense of urgency and the pace has really
picked up. I think you'll have a lot more informed voters as we get
closer."</TE>
<TE>   Competing for a job that would pay $12,000 annually, the
candidates have stumped across the Valley, and some are preparing to
air commercials on local cable television and radio stations in the
next week.</TE>
<TE>   Most have pledged to expand the police force, cut the business tax
and help improve public schools.</TE>
<TE>   "This race is wide open," said Mel Wilson, a Realtor who placed
fifth in the poll, with 2%, despite endorsements from the Southern
California Assn. of Realtors and other organizations. Wilson had
raised $45,000 for the campaign, second to Richman's $127,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Fund-raising for this campaign, although I feel I'm doing well,
has been difficult compared to other campaigns," Richman said.
"Candidates are attempting to raise money for a position that may not
be in existence."</TE>
<TE>   The mayoral campaigns also have been hampered by the failure of
the central secession drive to generate the money, television
advertising, volunteers and public excitement that it originally
promised, said Tom Hogen-Esch, a political scientist at Cal State
Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the candidates are really dependent on the synergy of the
overall secession campaign to generate interest and help get their
message out," Hogen-Esch said. "If that campaign is dead in the
water, as it has been, those candidates have virtually no way of
getting their message out."</TE>
<TE>   While Richman has sent out hundreds of thousands of pieces of
mail, only Bruce Boyer, an alarm company manager, has a television
commercial airing -- on cable television in the East Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "If Richman only gets 13%, that's fine with me," said Boyer, who
got 1% in the poll. "I figure the winner will need 25% to win, and
I'm the only one on television."</TE>
<TE>   Richman, a former city redevelopment commissioner, and Wilson, a
former city fire commissioner and Metropolitan Transportation Agency
board member, plan to begin running spots on Valley cable stations
next week.</TE>

<HD>Federal Screeners Take Over at Airport</HD>
<DH>Post-9/11 security measure begins at John Wayne.
Bomb-detection devices are due by the end of year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. Reza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta inaugurated the use of
federal screeners at John Wayne Airport on Wednesday and announced
that high-tech equipment to check baggage for explosives will be in
place by December.</LD>
<LD>   About 150 screeners hired by the Transportation Security
Administration began reporting for duty earlier in the day at
passenger security checkpoints.</LD>
<LD>   John Wayne will have a full staff of 193 screeners by next month,
Mineta said.</LD>
<TE>   The new workers are federal employees who are doing a job
previously done by a private security company. Mineta said the
federal screeners received extensive training and will provide air
travelers "world-class security and world-class service."</TE>
<TE>   Federal security workers have to meet stiffer requirements than
private screeners. They must undergo 40 hours of classroom
instruction and 60 hours of on-the-job training. They also have to be
U.S. citizens with at least a high school education or its
equivalency. Private screeners had no citizenship, education or
federally mandated training requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Pedro Lopez, 42, of Santa Ana was typical of the new screeners.
Lopez retired from the U.S. Army but was lured out of retirement by
the 2001 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "That convinced me that I needed to do something to serve my
country again. I feel that I am providing security to my fellow
citizens again," Lopez said. "The knowledge I picked up about
explosives and demolitions in the Army will help me here."</TE>
<TE>   Mineta said John Wayne will be among the first airports in the
country to get machines capable of detecting explosives and explosive
residue in baggage. The equipment will be operational by Dec. 31, he
said.</TE>

<HD>Ex-MTA Official Said to Be Under Investigation</HD>
<DH>Some interviewed by the agency say John Bollinger is
suspected of giving contracts to an engineer who handed him
consulting work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Marosi and Kurt Streeter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority inspector general's office
is investigating possible conflict-of-interest violations by a former
high-ranking official who managed construction of the agency's
headquarters, according to several people interviewed by
investigators.</LD>
<LD>   John Bollinger, former director of the Union Station Gateway
project, left the agency in June, one month after investigators,
acting on an inquiry by The Times, confiscated 34 boxes of records
from his office.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators suspect that Bollinger was awarding MTA contracts to
an outside engineer, Hector Castillo, while he was receiving
consulting work from companies or nonprofit organizations controlled
by Castillo, the interview subjects said.</LD>
<TE>   In May, Castillo was ordered out of an office he kept at the MTA
and his work for the agency was discontinued, according to an
internal memorandum.</TE>
<TE>   MTA officials would not detail the circumstances of Bollinger's
departure, and he was not available for comment. "It's a personnel
matter," said the transit agency's top lawyer, Steve Carnevale.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo also declined to comment, but in the past he has denied
any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Bollinger managed the construction of the 27-story headquarters,
but his responsibilities had diminished since the building opened in
1995.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the accounts of three people who have been interviewed by
investigators, the probe appears to focus on Bollinger's relationship
with Castillo, whose Los Angeles-based firm, H.C. &amp; Associates, has
done work for several area cities.</TE>
<TE>   Bollinger first authorized Castillo's firm to do work for the MTA,
the nation's second-largest transit agency, in 1998. Most of it
involved record-keeping and administrative duties, including a
contract to count the number of parking spaces at the Gateway center.</TE>
<TE>   For the parking survey (there are 2,189 spaces), and other
administrative tasks, Castillo charged $27,500. In all, through this
year, Castillo's firm was paid at least $125,000.</TE>
<TE>   During the time that Castillo had MTA contracts, Bollinger worked
at three Castillo-controlled companies or organizations.</TE>
<TE>   * Earlier this year, Bollinger worked for Castillo's company on a
South Gate project to reorganize the city's public works department,
city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   * On Bollinger's 2002 Statement of Economic Interests, he reported
receiving anywhere from $10,000 to $100,000 in income from the Latino
Engineers, Architects and Developers Society Inc., a nonprofit
organization headed by Castillo.</TE>
<TE>   * In 1999, Bollinger received $1,500 in consulting fees from the
Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, another nonprofit
organization once headed by Castillo, according to a check-register
database from the organization.</TE>
<TE>   Bollinger's relationship with Castillo came to light after several
members of the Hispanic Professional Engineers group won a lawsuit to
gain control of the organization from Castillo. As part of that suit,
a court-appointed special master who reviewed the books concluded
that Castillo had likely embezzled thousands of dollars and possibly
given kickbacks to Bollinger.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, several members of the Latino engineers group
have been interviewed by investigators seeking more information about
Castillo's tenure as president and his relationship with Bollinger.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Marquez, the current president, said authorities asked
questions about a fund-raiser for the group that was sponsored by the
MTA when Bollinger headed the Gateway project. "Apparently, the MTA
had given SHIP some money, and now SHIP had given Bollinger some
money for consulting," Marquez said. "They were saying that that was
a conflict of interest."</TE>
<TE>   The investigation started after The Times in May requested public
records detailing the MTA contracts of H.C. &amp; Associates. The
agency's inspector general is an independent branch of the MTA
charged with ferreting out waste, fraud and abuse. The inspector
general does not comment on ongoing investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have said the Gateway center is symbolic of waste and the
agency's poor spending priorities. The building, mocked as the "Taj
Mahal" by some critics, is lined with granite and Italian marble, and
has brass fountains and a lavish, palm-lined entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Bollinger, whose annual salary was $86,000, managed the
$300-million project for nearly a decade. With his management of the
project winding down, Bollinger in recent months had been overseeing
minor construction projects and supervising a close-out audit.</TE>

<HD>Care Home Problems Blamed on Staffing</HD>
<DH>The poor quality of California's nursing homes is due to a
lack of aides, a report says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein and Michael Krikorian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Low staffing levels in California nursing homes are largely
responsible for their poor overall quality, depriving residents of
basic assistance to use the bathroom, eat meals and walk around,
according to a study of California's nursing homes.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Lopez, 36, couldn't agree more. "We need more help," said
Lopez, who takes a 45-minute bus ride to his $7.53-an-hour job as a
certified nurse assistant, leaving each day stressed and worn out.</LD>
<LD>   "It's hard to work with 10 patients a day," he said, refusing to
name the Los Angeles home where he works for fear of retaliation.</LD>
<TE>   A review released by the California HealthCare Foundation this
week found that many residents received less than five minutes of
assistance with eating and were given bathroom help fewer than two
times in 12 hours.</TE>
<TE>   "Seventy percent of these residents are incontinent," said
Charlene Harrington, the study's lead researcher and a professor at
the UC San Francisco School of Nursing. "They need assistance to the
toilet every two to three hours, and they're not being given it."</TE>
<TE>   But industry officials said the Medicare and Medicaid programs,
which pay for most nursing home care, are not providing enough money
to give elderly residents the attention they deserve.</TE>
<TE>   Nursing homes have trouble attracting and retaining nurse aides,
who are in short supply but perform more than 70% of patient-care
tasks. The California HealthCare Foundation review found that the
average aide earned $9.57 per hour in 2000-01, below the rate paid by
hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "While [aides] are at the bottom of the wage totem pole, they are
entrusted with the bulk of care-giving responsibility," said Collin
Wong, director of the Bureau of Medi-Cal Fraud and Elder Abuse in the
state attorney general's office.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the scope of their responsibilities, you'll find
that serious injury or death can result if their responsibilities are
not discharged competently."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, who has been a nursing aide for 11 years, said he feels
pressure as soon as he walks in the door at 7 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to do many things," he said. "Take their vital signs.
Help them walk. Give them showers. Clean them. Sometimes feed them."</TE>
<TE>   The facility wants to hire more nursing aides, he said, but is
having difficulty. "Nobody wants to work under these conditions
because they don't pay enough."</TE>
<TE>   Certified nurse aide Rocio Rodriguez works at a different Los
Angeles home, but shares Lopez's feelings. She said she often is sad
that she can't spend more time with the elderly patients.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes they just want you to sit down and talk to them, but we
don't have time to talk," said Rodriguez, 20, who earns $7.88 an
hour. "I mean, I don't want to be rude, but sometimes I have to
ignore what they are telling me because I have to go to the next
patient."</TE>
<TE>   She is forced at times to cut corners. "A lot of times we don't do
oral care ... cleaning their dentures or brushing their teeth because
we're in such a hurry," she said. "This place needs more people and
higher wages. It's just too much work for the little bit of pay you
get."</TE>
<TE>   Like Lopez, she declined to name the home where she works.</TE>
<TE>   With the publication of key research, government officials and
watchdogs increasingly are stressing the importance of adequate
staffing in nursing homes.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the U.S. General Accounting Office concluded that nurse
aide staffing -- the hours devoted to an average patient each day --
is a good predictor of the quality of homes, even better than overall
spending per patient.</TE>
<TE>   Another report, ordered by Congress and completed last December,
found that higher levels of nurse staffing reduced the need to
hospitalize residents for treatable conditions and infections.
Residents also experienced fewer pressure sores and less weight loss
when they had additional help, said researcher Dr. Andrew Kramer of
the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.</TE>
<TE>   "In almost every case, there was a relationship between staffing
levels and these quality measures," Kramer said. Kramer and his
colleagues recommended at least 4.1 hours of nursing assistance per
patient every day, but said that more than nine in 10 homes don't
provide that level of care. So far, the federal government is balking
because that level of care could cost billions of dollars to
implement.</TE>
<TE>   California has been more aggressive than most states in setting
staffing standards. In January 2000, the state began requiring
nursing homes to provide at least 3.2 hours of nursing assistance per
day to each patient, on average.</TE>
<TE>   The California HealthCare Foundation found that about 44% of homes
were not complying with the state's nursing staff standards in 2000
and 2001. Because of the shortage of nurses and nurse aides, industry
officials said it took some homes extra time to comply.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Legislature went a step further, requiring the
state to set minimum ratios for nursing assistants to residents.
Those ratios, which have not been set, will take effect in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic Assembly Leader Kevin Shelley (D-San Francisco) said he
wants to make it easy for family members to count the employees on a
floor and determine if a nursing home is following the law. Shelley,
who is running for secretary of state, said the goal is to have
enough staff to respond when a resident presses a call button.</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials agreed that more staffing is needed, but they
said more money is needed too. Homes that accept high numbers of
Medi-Cal patients are at the state's mercy, they said. "What they pay
us in reimbursement is what we have to pass on to the workers," said
Betsy Hite, public affairs director of the California Assn. of Health
Facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they have increased Medi-Cal nursing home
reimbursements nearly 20% since August 2000, more than for many other
medical providers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any of us have all of the resources that we could
possibly want in these areas, especially with the economy where it's
at," said Diana Bonta, director of the state Department of Health
Services.</TE>
<TE>   "But there have been significant movements" in the right
direction, she said.</TE>

<LD>Two men and a woman accused of beating and robbing four people in a

<LD>   Jason Clark Harper, 21, and Neil Joseph Zajic, 25, both of
Placentia, and Jennifer Michelle Stokes, 22, of Anaheim were
arraigned Wednesday. They were arrested late Monday after police
stopped their car, which matched the suspects' vehicle description,
in Placentia. A fourth suspect is at large.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the group attacked two men and two teenage girls
sitting in a parked car in the 4700 block of Greencrest Drive about
8:40 p.m. Monday then fled in a white Ford Bronco, said Sgt. Jack
Conklin of the Brea Police Department. The victims suffered cuts and

<LD>Actress Tawney Kitaen has sued her children's nanny, alleging that
the caretaker schemed to end her marriage with professional baseball
player Chuck Finley and humiliated Kitaen by posting her drug
prescriptions on the Internet, according to court documents.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit also names two pharmacies and a pharmacist as
defendants, contending that they unlawfully provided the nanny
information on Kitaen's medical prescriptions. Kitaen's estranged
husband filed for divorce and custody of their children in early

<HD>Driver Is Shot After Chase</HD>
<DH>A man running from a crash that hospitalized three people
is fired on after pointing a weapon at LAPD officers, authorities
say.</DH>

<AU>Richard Winton and Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police shot and wounded a suspected car thief at the end of a chase
Wednesday, marking the 24th time this year that LAPD officers have
shot a suspect.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, there were 22 such incidents.</LD>
<LD>   The unidentified 32-year-old Los Angeles man was shot several
times by Officers Charles Hicks, 34, and Andrew Moody, 39 -- both
six-year veterans -- who said they fired in self-defense after he
pointed a weapon at them that resembled a .45-caliber handgun, said
LAPD spokesman Lt. Horace Frank. The weapon was found to be a pellet
gun.</LD>
<TE>   The shooting took place at the end of a pursuit that began shortly
after midnight near Manchester Boulevard and Main Street in south Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   At one point during the 45-minute chase, officers saw the driver
point a gun to his head, and they temporarily broke off the pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   The chase ended near Florence Avenue and State Street in
Huntington Park, when the suspect collided with a vehicle carrying
three people. A woman in the second car sustained injuries that are
serious but not life-threatening and was listed in critical condition
at a local hospital. The other two people in the car were also
hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   As the suspect ran from the scene, he pointed his weapon at
police, officers said. The officers fired several times through their
windshields.</TE>
<TE>   The wounded suspect was listed in critical condition at an
undisclosed hospital, where he was expected to survive, an LAPD
spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   There were 22 incidents in which a suspect was hit by gunfire in
2001 and 33 incidents in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third shooting in the last week, and in all three,
officers said they fired in self-defense. A man who led police on a
high-speed chase early Saturday was wounded by Officers Alfred
Gonzalez, 33, and Ernest Berry, 36, after he allegedly came at them
with a glass candlestick.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, a man who stabbed a woman in a domestic dispute was
shot to death after he came at police with a knife and refused to
drop the weapon.</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana Serial Rapist Faces Sentencing Today</HD>

<LD>A man who pleaded guilty to a series of rapes and robberies that set
a Santa Ana neighborhood on edge in 2000 is expected to face a
lengthy prison term when sentenced today.</LD>
<LD>   Eduardo Guzman, 24, pleaded guilty last week to more than three
dozen felony charges related to attacks on women who lived near his
Santa Ana home.</LD>
<LD>   Guzman pleaded guilty in the midst of his trial before Superior
Court Judge Frank F. Fasel.</LD>
<TE>   Guzman, a forklift operator who lived with his wife and their
young son at the time of the attacks, faces several possible life
sentences at today's hearing.</TE>
<TE>   At least eight women were raped or sexually assaulted and several
others were robbed during a three-month period in the summer of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged that Guzman lurked in the carports of gated
apartment buildings, watching women before choosing to strike.</TE>
<TE>   He used a knife during the attacks, police said.</TE>
<TE>   In a surprise move, Guzman agreed to have his trial heard by Fasel
rather than a jury.</TE>
<TE>   But before the judge could decide his fate, Guzman pleaded guilty.</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of surprised us," said Susan Schroeder, a spokeswoman for
the Orange County district attorney's office. "When they want to
plead to every count, we certainly can't prevent them."</TE>

<HD>Bratton Tells LAPD Brass to Submit Resumes</HD>
<DH>The incoming chief is seeking insiders with fresh ideas for
top command posts. Their material, including goals, is due Friday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein and Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the top brass of the Los Angeles Police Department, it's time to
dust off the resumes and touch up those beauty shots, literally.</LD>
<LD>   From the outset, incoming Chief William J. Bratton said he intends
to pick a new command team of department insiders who can provide
fresh ideas to carry out his vision for change at the LAPD.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Bratton has begun in earnest. He has told 114 commanders to
submit memos with resumes, pictures, and a list of the officer's
three top accomplishments and three goals for a new-look LAPD.</LD>
<TE>   To some commanders, it is either the first breath of fresh air to
blow through the stale environs of Parker Center and its outlying
divisions, or the career-ending equivalent of being handed a
cigarette and a blindfold.</TE>
<TE>   The answers are due on the desk of Bratton's transition-team
leader, Cmdr. Jim McDonnell, by 5 p.m. Friday. McDonnell said Bratton
will review the information as quickly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "The answer to those questions will allow Bratton to make quick
and decisive decisions immediately when he takes office," McDonnell
said. "He'll be sworn in on [Oct.] 28 and relatively swiftly after
that, we want to hit the ground running and getting the LAPD moving."</TE>
<TE>   Most agree that the bid to tap the thoughts of so many commanders,
whose salaries range above $90,000, is unusual, if not unprecedented.</TE>
<TE>   Former Assistant Chief David Dotson said he could not recall any
incoming chief making such a request of the entire command staff.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally speaking, when a new chief comes in, there isn't
usually a transition plan," Dotson said. "Certainly, no one has sent
out something so formalized in the past."</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Assistant Chief Dave Gascon said he was not surprised that
the new chief would ask for input.</TE>
<TE>   "Every chief of police has taken an opportunity to meet and
discuss with the staff of the organization, the critical issues
facing the organization," he said. "And [they have] received that
input in terms of suggestions for addressing those critical issues."</TE>
<TE>   Cmdr. Sharon Papa, the department's ombudsman, said the move made
sense as a way for Bratton to become familiar with the vast number of
top managers in the department, and also to determine who is best
suited to carry out his agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was walking into this department, I'd want this too," Papa
said. "Some of the previous chiefs may have been better prepared if
they'd done it.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people may wrongly view it as a test," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I see it as an opportunity for people to express themselves," she
said. "It is certainly easier than the new chief pulling everyone's
file."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton has vowed to install his team within two weeks of being
sworn in as chief.</TE>
<TE>   The former head of the New York Police Department has said he will
recruit his leadership team from within the ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton has identified several current LAPD leaders he highly
respects, including Papa, Deputy Chief David Kalish and Cmdr. George
Gascon. They along with McDonnell unsuccessfully applied for the
chief's post.</TE>
<TE>   Some wonder why the survey is needed, given Bratton's clear
pronouncements about his intentions.</TE>
<TE>   Since his selection by Mayor James K. Hahn, Bratton has repeatedly
promised a major makeover -- a "re-engineering" -- of the nearly
9,000-officer department, from top to bottom. His model is the city's
legal settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice last year, after
that agency concluded that the LAPD had engaged in a "pattern or
practice" of civil rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton has publicly warned that those who don't embrace the
consent decree, which embodies the settlement, or the need for
change, should retire.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, Bratton said, he wants to fill out his roster with
commanders who endorse his policing concepts and "who are very
desirous of change, who have been extraordinarily frustrated for a
variety of reasons over the last 10 years."</TE>

<HD>Drug Charge Dropped, Trial Delayed for Winona Ryder</HD>
<DH>Prosecutor says the actress' doctor gave her the painkiller
she had when arrested. Her shoplifting case is put off till next
Thursday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Acting on the recommendation of prosecutors, a judge dismissed a
felony drug possession charge against actress Winona Ryder on
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Elden S. Fox scheduled a
trial on the remaining theft allegations against her for next
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Ryder attended the court session in Beverly Hills, but remained
silent except to tell Fox that she did not object to going to trial
next week.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann Rundle recommended the
dismissal last week. She has said that Ryder "lacked criminal
knowledge" needed for a conviction because her doctor gave the drug,
a painkiller, to her.</TE>
<TE>   She said Wednesday that the doctor, whom she did not identify,
dispensed the drug without a prescription.</TE>
<TE>   "Any criminal responsibility" would be with the doctor rather than
Ryder, Rundle said. Rundle said the doctor's action is the subject of
"an ongoing investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office,
refused to reveal the name of the doctor and said she did not know
which agency was investigating the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder, 30, is accused of taking about $6,000 in merchandise,
including purses, hats, hair bands, a sweater and a shirt, from Saks
Fifth Avenue on Dec. 12. The charges included grand theft, burglary
and vandalism. She faces up to three years in prison if convicted.
She is free on $20,000 bond.</TE>
<TE>   The drug, Oxycodone, was found by police after her arrest. Her
lawyer said Ryder was taking the drug for an arm injury.</TE>

<HD>Tire-Accident Case Is Settled for $13 Million</HD>
<DH>Huntington Beach man suffered brain damage when the wheel
of a big rig flew across the freeway and crushed the cab of his
pickup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Monte Morin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Huntington Beach motorist who suffered severe brain damage when a
loose tire rocketed across the Santa Ana Freeway and collided with
his pickup truck will receive $13 million under a settlement reached
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Under the deal, trucking giant Allied Systems Ltd. and a tire
servicing firm accepted equal responsibility for the accident, which
left 39-year-old plaintiff Philip Dohrman legally blind, unemployable
and unable to drive.</LD>
<LD>   "It hit him like a bolt of lightning out of the sky," plaintiff's
attorney Daniel Callahan said. "There was nothing he could do about
it at all."</LD>
<TE>   The accident occurred Jan. 9, 2001, when the wheel of a tractor
trailer spun off its axle, sailed into oncoming traffic and crushed
the cab of Dohrman's truck. The collision occurred in the northbound
lane of the Santa Ana Freeway in Irvine, near Sand Canyon Avenue. The
nearly 200-pound tire had been fastened insecurely to the big rig,
which was hauling a load of new Toyota cars.</TE>
<TE>   Dohrman, represented by the Santa Ana law firm Callahan &amp; Blaine,
alleged in court papers that the driver of the big rig was never
trained to make regular checks of the vehicle's wheels and lug nuts.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiff said Allied Systems Ltd. had violated a number of
its own policies and state requirements for maintenance of its
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Among other shortcomings, Callahan said, the driver of the big rig
was never shown a company video explaining the need and procedures
for checking lug nuts, nor was he told to inspect the lug nuts.
Callahan said that service records showed the vehicle had not
undergone maintenance for 180 days, even though it is required to be
serviced every 90 days.</TE>
<TE>   However, Allied Systems lawyer Kevin Smith said that a contractor
working for Allied had over-tightened the lug nuts, cracking and
weakening them.</TE>
<TE>   When the tire dislodged from the tractor-trailer, a motorist
behind Dohrman witnessed the accident. The tire, which careened over
the highway divider, jumped 20 feet into the air before slamming into
the cab of Dohrman's Ford F150. After crushing the cab, the tire
bounced 100 feet into the air.</TE>
<TE>   Dohrman, who was joined in the suit by his wife, Julie, 31, was
rendered unconscious upon impact. When he awoke from a semi-coma,
doctors discovered that his vision had been badly reduced, his speech
impaired and his memory flawed.</TE>
<TE>   "If you tell him something, he cannot remember it 15 minutes
later," Callahan said. "He tries to compensate for it by taking
notes. He's entirely reliant on a notepad now."</TE>
<TE>   Dohrman, a former construction supervisor and volunteer
firefighter, was an avid bodybuilder, motorcyclist, and in-line
skater before the accident, Callahan said. Now, it is difficult for
him to walk.</TE>
<TE>   "He walks, but he's very unsteady," the lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Both Allied and the tire service firm were insured by Zurich
Financial and Lloyds of London, who will pay the settlement in
installments.</TE>

<HD>Faulty Pump-Outs Are Blamed in Sewage Dumps</HD>
<DH>Environmental group's study warns that a lack of working
stations at the county's three harbors is contributing to ocean
contamination.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County boaters may be illegally dumping raw sewage into the
ocean because the harbor pump-out stations designed to transport it
safely to shore are largely inoperable, according to a study released
by an environmental group this week.</LD>
<LD>   The report by Orange County Coastkeeper of Newport Beach, warns of
a serious potential for environmental damage.</LD>
<LD>   "I've heard a number of other boaters in the harbor complain,"
said Roberta Jorgensen, a Coastkeeper board member who owns a 33-foot
power boat in Newport Harbor. "They just can't find [a pump-out
station] that works, so they go out and dump into the ocean."</LD>
<TE>   Coastal regulations prohibit the dumping of sewage within three
miles of shore. But not all boaters abide by that, resulting in ocean
contamination.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Berchtold, a spokesman for the Santa Ana Regional Water
Quality Control Board, which oversees two of the county's three
harbors, said he hadn't seen the group's report and couldn't comment
on its specifics. But the board, he said, "looks forward to reviewing
the information the Coastkeepers put together and will participate in
helping solve any problems they have identified."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Honeybourne, chief of the Orange County Health Care Agency's
water quality section, said that the county had set up a committee
about six months ago to examine problems at the more than 30 harbor
pump-out stations.</TE>
<TE>   "We are aware of the issue and looking at the problem," he said.
"We are concerned about anything that restricts the possibility of
getting sewage into the sanitary sewage collection system."</TE>
<TE>   According to the survey -- conducted from June through September,
during peak boating season -- only 44% of the stations in Huntington
Harbour were operational. Similarly, the report said, about 69% of
the Newport Harbor stations were functioning.</TE>
<TE>   The report's authors assigned grades of F and D+ to the two
harbors, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Dana Point Harbor -- overseen by the Regional Water Quality
Control Board's San Diego office -- earned a B, with 81.25% of its
stations functioning.</TE>
<TE>   The pump-out stations -- essentially hoses attached to pumps that
flush raw sewage from a boat into the sewer system onshore -- are
operated by a variety of entities, including the county, local
municipalities and private interests.</TE>
<TE>   Among the report's recommendations is that a set of uniform
regulatory standards be adopted governing the stations' numbers,
inspection and repair.</TE>
<TE>   "Collectively they are poorly managed," said Garry Brown,
executive director of the nonprofit environmental group whose
mission, he said, is to protect the marine habitat. "We expected that
if one was broken it would be fixed, but we found that that wasn't
the case."</TE>
<TE>   Boaters unable to use the stations, he said, have to choose
between hiring a service to remove their sewage or dumping it --
preferably the mandatory three miles offshore.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want boaters to do the right thing," Brown said, "you have
to have the facilities for them to do it."</TE>

<HD>Stop Sign Quest Can Be Tough Going</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>Fourth in a series on Los Angeles city services.</SE>
<AU>Sharon Bernstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a new stop sign at the corner of Blue Canyon and Picturesque
drives in Studio City, posted by city traffic engineers after
neighbors said the hillside intersection wasn't safe.</LD>
<LD>   There's just one problem.</LD>
<LD>   The sign is on the opposite corner from where residents had
requested it. So instead of stopping motorists on Picturesque Drive
from whizzing down Blue Canyon to Ventura Boulevard, it stops them on
the way up, where drivers already go slowly up the steep slope.</LD>
<TE>   "They were very quick and very efficient, but it wasn't the sign
we wanted," said Charles Dennis, a screenwriter who lives on Blue
Canyon Drive with his wife, Kim, and 2-year-old daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very confusing," Kim Dennis said.</TE>
<TE>   The Dennises and their neighbors had run into a common frustration
of Los Angeles residents who try to regulate traffic in their
communities: Their idea of an unsafe street doesn't meet city
standards for installation of stop signs or speed bumps. The city
will install a sign if an intersection meets any of 10 conditions. If
it doesn't, such as the Picturesque Drive case, the request is
typically denied.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood secession
proposals say these small conflicts are more than debates over
traffic and safety. They argue that the city is inattentive to detail
and unresponsive to community concerns such as those involving street
signs. And that attitude, they say, has helped fuel a larger
discontent with city government, convincing many residents that their
problems are not taken seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Spikell, a Studio City resident who is running for a
seat on the Valley city council that would be created if secession is
approved in the Nov. 5 election, said that a Valley city would be
more flexible, and more responsive to neighbors' concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very kind; they come out and listen to you and then go
back to those very specific criteria and deny it -- regardless of
whether you had a good reason for the request," Spikell said of city
transportation engineers.</TE>
<TE>   Spikell said that she recently requested a street light after an
armed robbery on her block, but was turned down.</TE>
<TE>   "If you call back and try to revisit the issue, you may get them
to reconsider, but it takes a long time," she said.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the rigidity is sheer volume.</TE>
<TE>   Last fiscal year, the Los Angeles Department of Transportation
fielded 18,446 demands for stop signs, traffic lights and the like,
and responded to 17,832 of them, according to principal traffic
engineer Jack Reynolds. Of the total requests, about 800 were for
stop signs, Reynolds said.</TE>
<TE>   For years, the focus of transportation planning in Los Angeles was
finding ways to speed up and smooth out traffic, Reynolds and others
said. So requests for everything from speed bumps to traffic lights
were judged in part on whether they would unnecessarily slow traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The Dennises live at the corner of Blue Canyon and Picturesque
drives, in an older house that has no front lawn and a narrow
sidewalk. Cars pass just a few feet from their garage and front
steps. The same is true for their neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "The traffic is so bad you can't even cross the street," said Paul
Yarmola, a retired construction worker who lives next door to the
Dennises. "They've got a phone in one hand and a coffee or whatever
they're drinking in the other, and I don't know what hands are
driving."</TE>
<TE>   The neighbors figured that a stop sign on Picturesque Drive would
be the solution. After a few phone calls, a city worker said they had
to write a letter to the Los Angeles Department of Transportation,
describing the problem and requesting the sign.</TE>
<TE>   Yarmola's daughter-in-law, LaVerne, and Charles Dennis wrote
letters in February. That set in motion an evaluation of the traffic
patterns at the intersection.</TE>
<TE>   Citywide, according to Reynolds, 4 1/2 months elapse on average
between a request for a sign and the installation. The time varies by
neighborhood depending on the number of pending requests,
Transportation Department staffing in that part of town, and the
complexity of the given traffic study, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The city is aiming for a 60-day turnaround on the whole process,
Reynolds said, but budget cuts have kept staffing levels low, and
that has slowed down the work.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists say a Valley city would respond more quickly. And
some other cities do appear to carry out the process more efficiently
than Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose, for instance, has a Web page devoted entirely to stop
signs. It tells residents how to apply for a sign, how to ask that a
damaged sign be repaired, and how to appeal if their requests are
turned down.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has Web-based information on stop signs, but it is
less detailed and harder to find.</TE>
<TE>   After the city received the requests from residents of Blue Canyon
and Picturesque drives, a Department of Transportation engineer
measured the traffic, watched for pedestrians, and determined that
only the uphill corner met the requirements for a stop sign. On June
11, a little more than five months after LaVerne Yarmola wrote her
letter, the city approved the sign for Blue Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   To contest a stop-sign decision, residents must write another
letter, explaining why they think the intersection is dangerous even
though it failed to meet city requirements. Neither the Dennises nor
LaVerne Yarmola have done so; they said they didn't know there was an
avenue for appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds said the city was trying hard to accommodate neighbors'
requests, and that traffic engineers do have some discretion to
approve signs even if the official criteria are not met.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, the intersection must be clearly dangerous -- and
should come pretty close to meeting one of the city's 10
requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "If you put stop signs where everybody wanted one, you'd have them
every block, and nobody would pay any respect to them," Reynolds
said. "You lose respect for the traffic control if you have too many
of them."</TE>

<HD>Olson Sentenced to 14 Years in Prison; Parole Possible in 8</HD>
<DH>State board cites violent nature of former Symbionese
Liberation Army associate's crime and the fact she was a fugitive for
24 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CHOWCHILLA</DL>
<LD>The state Board of Prison Terms ruled Wednesday that Sara Jane Olson,
convicted last year in a failed bomb plot to kill Los Angeles Police
Department officers, should serve 14 years for her crime.</LD>
<LD>   The former associate of the radical Symbionese Liberation Army
will not be eligible for parole until at least 2010.</LD>
<LD>   The board made its decision at the Central California Women's
Facility in Chowchilla, after an emotional 1 1/2-hour hearing at
which Olson and two intended victims of the 1975 bombing attempt
testified. Olson's lawyer had asked that she serve no more than five
years and four months.</LD>
<TE>   Board commissioner Tom Bordonaro said the three-member panel has a
duty to protect the public from "extraordinary crimes." The board
based its decision on the fact that Olson was a fugitive for nearly
25 years, the multiple intended victims and the violent nature and
seriousness of the crime, Bordonaro said.</TE>
<TE>   "Only by virtue of circumstance did the bomb not discharge," he
said. "It would have surely taken the lives of the officers along
with great probability of those who were in the immediate vicinity."</TE>
<TE>   Olson appeared at the hearing wearing the prison uniform of jeans,
a white and blue jersey and tennis shoes, and much of the time
appeared to be on the verge of tears. Olson, who changed her name
from Kathleen Soliah, told the commissioners that she has had a lot
of time in prison to think about what she did and what she could have
done differently.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm incredibly sorry," said Olson, 55. "Of course, I can't take
it back so I have to take responsibility, and that's what I'm doing
now."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Latin, however, disputed that remark:</TE>
<TE>   "This is a textbook example of somebody who did not take
responsibility," he said. "She took desperate and elaborate measures
to avoid responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Olson pleaded guilty last year to two charges of attempting to
bomb two Los Angeles police cars in what prosecutors said was a plot
to avenge the deaths of six Symbionese Liberation Army members during
a shootout with Los Angeles Police Department officers a year
earlier. Olson had lived as a suburban mom while on the lam for
nearly a quarter century before her arrest in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Larry Fidler sentenced her
in January to 20 years to life in state prison, but warned her that
the state board has the authority to make the final decision, and
that she could spend the rest of her life behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   The board has the power to set Olson's sentence because the crime
was committed before 1977, when California sentencing laws changed.</TE>
<TE>   The board is permitted to hold hearings to determine whether such
inmates are "serious offenders" and should have their sentences
extended.</TE>
<TE>   As the hearing started, Olson began crying and wiped her eyes.
When the commissioner asked her if she was OK, she responded, "No I'm
not, but there's not much I can do about it."</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Officer John Hall, who narrowly escaped death from one of the
bombs, said, "It has taken 27 years to bring this defendant to
justice for this cowardly act ... I would hope you would protect our
citizens from terrorists -- both past and present."</TE>
<TE>   Retired officer Marty Feinmark, who found the other bomb beneath
an unmarked car, echoed those thoughts. "Just because we weren't
blown up or anybody else wasn't blown up, that means nothing," he
said. "The intent was there."</TE>
<TE>   Olson was indicted by the Los Angeles County Grand Jury in 1976 on
charges of conspiring to murder police officers by planting the
bombs. She is also charged with murder in a Sacramento-area bank
robbery that left a mother of four dead.</TE>
<TE>   The board heard arguments from both sides and asked Olson several
questions, including why she fled. Her attorney, Shawn Chapman,
responded, saying that her client left town before an indictment was
issued, but acknowledged that she fled because she saw her friends
and brother arrested for crimes committed by the SLA. Chapman also
said that Olson admits she helped the SLA, but denies making pipe
bombs or planting them beneath police cars.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman urged the board not to extend the sentence, arguing that
her client has been a law-abiding, peaceful and productive member of
society since the crimes were committed. Olson, a mother of three
from St. Paul, Minn., read to the blind, taught English classes and
tutored drama students, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "She poses no threat of danger whatsoever to society," Chapman
said, adding that she is being punished. "She is serving hard time."</TE>
<TE>   Latin argued that Olson should serve the maximum sentence of life
in prison, with the earliest parole possibility in 14 years. He
stressed that the nail-packed bombs, the largest ever recovered in
California, were sophisticated, well built and extremely powerful.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not an exaggeration or use of rhetoric to call this act an
act of terrorism," Latin said. "There's no question that it was."</TE>
<TE>   Since last May, Olson has been at the state prison in Chowchilla,
where she is housed in a dormitory-like room with as many as seven
other women. Because of her notoriety and escape potential, she does
not have access to educational or vocational programs, prison
officials said. She is also on a waiting list for a job at the
prison. The prison houses about 3,150 inmates, including 14 women on
death row.</TE>
<TE>   After Wednesday's hearing, Chapman said she plans to appeal the
decision, which is expected to be final in 90 days.</TE>

<KH>SURROUNDINGS REDONDO BEACH PIER</KH>
<HD>A Site That the Pounding Sea Can't Conquer</HD>
<DH>Facility full of colorful characters, shops and restaurants
has been rebuilt at least nine times, a historian says, since it went
up in 1889.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Ferrell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I don't know how you won the war -- you can't even catch a
mackerel!" says John, the German, who is 74, gruff and lugs his
fishing pole with a heavy limp.</LD>
<LD>   His friend Kuni Miyake only grins. "He's always telling me, 'I
don't see how you won the war,' " grouses Miyake, who is 87.</LD>
<LD>   John was behind the German front, a teenager not yet of the age to
fight. Miyake, of Japanese descent, was interned, then drafted, and
flew missions to Germany as part of the U.S. Army's 13th Airborne
Division.</LD>
<TE>   Now they spar only with words on the Redondo Beach Pier, passing
their latter years in the idle chase for mackerel, bonito and an
occasional yellowtail.</TE>
<TE>   Long past cultural sensitivities, they savor their brusque humor.
As many days as they can, they convene at the rail with other
rough-hewn regulars who account for the color of one of the Southland
coastline's oldest -- and most beleaguered -- piers.</TE>
<TE>   The structure is peopled with characters, distinct for a certain
unvarnished charm, despite the artsy design of the reconstruction
after the big storm and fire of 1988. The pier dates back well over a
century, if you allow for the fact that it has been rebuilt, in
various forms, at least nine times, according to one historian. It
supports a hodgepodge of shops and restaurants that extend well out
over the water.</TE>
<TE>   The south flank juts straight into the sea. Spliced to that is the
U-shaped horseshoe pier, which leads to another piece of the complex:
the International Walk, a promenade of lobster tanks, fresh fish
counters and bars that rim a pocket of boat slips.</TE>
<TE>   Walking the decks, you can't take in the entire scene at once.
There is a touch of mystery to the unseen corners, sounds of crashing
surf and unusual aesthetic lines. The pilings of the horseshoe pier
form a cage around a section of beach.</TE>
<TE>   At night, restaurant lights gleam on the water. Salt winds blow
live jazz and rock 'n' roll. A cavernous room built into the coast,
below the main deck, houses a vast penny arcade, thundering with its
own noises.</TE>
<TE>   The pier seems to emerge from the shoreline -- from a long sweep
of beach -- as if a part of nature, a squarish growth of wood and
glass that has always been there. It draws people and sometimes takes
hold of them.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Nichols started coming to the pier when he was no more than
5. For much of his adult life he worked at Zeppy's Pizza on the
horseshoe, and finally, seven years ago, he bought the establishment.
The walls are arrayed with impressive old fishing photos -- a giant
mako shark landed nearby, a bonito the size of a man's torso, a
17-foot great white weighing more than 2 tons.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see anything that competes with this," Nichols, 47, says
of the pier area, more sprawling and unpretentious than its rival,
the Santa Monica Pier, to the north.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Trutanich also fell in love with the pier as a child. He grew
up in San Pedro and came to the pier to get clams at the fresh-fish
markets. Fifty years ago, Trutanich established a two-story,
kiosk-shaped restaurant, Old Tony's, that remains a landmark. He also
operates Tony's Fish Market, a restaurant with views of the Palos
Verdes Peninsula, and raves about the beauty of the setting.</TE>
<TE>   "How many places can you go and have a lovely dinner, and see the
surf pounding on the beach, and see the boats out there, and the
sunsets?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   But like all things in nature, the pier has its cycles. During hot
summers, it thrives. Most merchants reap all their profits from June
through Labor Day. The rest of the year they languish.</TE>
<TE>   Winters bring battering storms. Histories of Redondo Beach are
filled with accounts of destruction, pier lumber being scattered like
litter on the beach.</TE>
<TE>   The first pier, known as Wharf No. 1, was completed in 1889, when
the developing town was a resort destination served by the Santa Fe
railroad. The lavish Hotel Redondo opened near the beachside rail
terminus, boasting a fireplace in every room. A special promotion
allowed travelers to come from as far as Kansas City for only $1,
says Mary Ann Keating, chairwoman of the Redondo Beach Historical
Commission. "You could take the train out, go out on the pier ... and
get on a steamship and go anywhere in the world," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Two other wharves were added, but a storm in 1915 destroyed Wharf
No. 1. Wharf No. 2 was badly damaged by a storm in 1919 and torn down
soon afterward. Construction and destruction recurred even after a
breakwater was built around nearby King Harbor in the late 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   The Arctic storm of 1988 packed 20-foot waves. "It was coming over
the top of the jetty and knocking boulders right out of the jetty,"
fisherman Dave Baker remembers. "A lot of the fishing boats ... it
turned them right over, sunk 'em."</TE>
<TE>   Four months later, electrical wiring damaged by the storm shorted
out, causing a huge fire. A third of the shops were destroyed. The
city spent $12 million, and took seven years, to rebuild the
horseshoe.</TE>
<TE>   Heading into winter, merchants are frustrated. Crowds have never
completely come back, they said. Many business owners yearn for the
days when foot traffic was so dense "you'd walk out and couldn't see
Hotdog-On-A-Stick" across the boardwalk, as kite shop owner Tom Fine
recalls.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing about a quarter of what we actually could do," he
says. "Until we get the end of the pier like it was before, it seems
like we're all just waiting."</TE>

storm and a fire, the city spent $12 million on a seven-year
restoration project.</CP>

<HD>Burbank Nurses Accuse Hospital of Delaying Union's
Certification</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karima Haynes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Registered nurses at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank
alleged Wednesday that hospital administrators are trying to prevent
them from organizing by delaying the certification of union election
results.</LD>
<LD>   The nurses went public with their assertion at a rally in front of
the hospital attended by television actors Mike Farrell of "M*A*S*H"
and "Providence" and Ellen Crawford of "ER.''</LD>
<LD>   Farrell said he had a personal connection to the hospital and its
nurses, who cared for his mother in the months before she died.</LD>
<TE>   "I have been to this hospital a number of times with my mother,
including a time when she broke her hip, and she was well cared for
by the people here," Farrell said.</TE>
<TE>   As first vice president of the Screen Actors Guild, Farrell said
he believes in the concept of collective bargaining and supported the
nurses' decision to form a union to meet their needs and those of
their patients.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford said she feels a certain solidarity with nurses because
she has spent time with so many in preparing for her role as nurse
Lydia Wright on "ER."</TE>
<TE>   "The public has to understand that when nurses are asking for
better working conditions, they are not talking about their personal
comfort but the conditions of patient care within the hospital," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of the hospital's 518 registered nurses voted Sept. 27
and 28 to join the Service Employees International Union, said Luisa
Blue, president of the union's Nurse Alliance of Southern California,
which represents 100,000 registered and licensed vocational nurses.</TE>
<TE>   "The working conditions are getting worse and we are forced to do
more with less," said Christine Terrones, a registered nurse who has
worked at the hospital for 17 years and is a member of the nurses'
leadership committee to establish a union. "The union will give us
more clout with the hospital, the state and the country to improve
patient care."</TE>
<TE>   Registered nurses contend that hospital administrators have held
up certification of the election results with "frivolous challenges
and objections," including voter intimidation and ballots cast by
ineligible nurses.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital executives deny that they have sought to delay
certification of the election results. Of the 493 ballots cast, union
officials challenged 51 and the hospital questioned five.</TE>
<TE>   "The five ballots were challenged by us because these employees do
not appear to be eligible to vote since they do not meet the minimum
number of on-the-job hours as defined by the National Labor Relations
Board," hospital spokeswoman Stephanie Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   The union had agreed to drop its challenges, but the hospital
executives declined, Blue said, adding that the union had enough
votes without the challenged ballots.</TE>
<TE>   The matter now goes before the National Labor Relations Board,
which will examine the 56 challenged ballots. Either side can appeal
the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "This challenge is not going to yield anything," Terrones said.
"We have voted. We have said we want a union and they need to respect
that."</TE>
<TE>   Unions representing nurses, once a minor force in Southern
California, have become increasingly aggressive at the largest
hospitals in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,700 nurses at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, the largest
nonprofit hospital in the West, will vote in December on whether to
join the California Nurses Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The same union has called for a one-day strike next week at Long
Beach Memorial Medical Center, where it represents 1,300 registered
nurses.</TE>
<TE>   Of the more than 130,000 active registered nurses in California
hospitals, 41% are unionized, up from 34% in 1995, according to the
U.S. Census Bureau.</TE>

<HD>West Valley Not Swept Up in Tide Against Secession</HD>
<DH>Residents voice defiance and determination in the wake of
poll showing that support for cityhood ballot measures is eroding.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sue Fox,  Kristina Sauerwein  and Sharon Bernstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Megan Luck, a young mother wheeling a stroller through her West Hills
neighborhood, has had enough of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   It doesn't matter to her that the feeling isn't mutual, as is
evident in a new Los Angeles Times poll on secession. She wants her
toddler son to grow up in a Valley city, sheltered from the crime and
grime of the urban core. Even if Los Angeles voters reject Valley
cityhood next month, Luck vowed to continue pushing for independence.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll keep doing it until we're separate," she said. "L.A. has too
many of its own problems. We shouldn't have to bother with them."</LD>
<TE>   Such expressions of determination and defiance were common on the
leafy streets of the West Valley on Wednesday, as voters digested the
findings of the poll. The survey showed support for the Hollywood and
Valley cityhood measures on the Nov. 5 ballot is eroding, even in the
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Only the West Valley is bucking the anti-secession tide that has
swept from the Westside to South-Central to the East Valley,
according to the poll of 970 likely voters.</TE>
<TE>   But even here, among the cul-de-sacs and tidy lawns where the
cityhood movement was born, the battle over secession is too close to
call.</TE>
<TE>   The poll found that 46% of likely voters in the West Valley favor
secession, while 42% oppose a breakup, a gap within the poll's margin
of error. Across the San Diego Freeway in the East Valley, an area
with more Latinos, Democrats and poorer residents, opposition
outweighs support 54% to 36%.</TE>
<TE>   Likely voters citywide oppose Valley secession by a 2-1 margin.
They are also overwhelmingly against Hollywood independence, 60% to
21%.</TE>
<TE>   In the East Valley, some residents said they were not surprised by
the poll's findings, which reflected their views on secession.</TE>
<TE>   At the Eagle Cafe in the North Hollywood arts district,
Christopher Guckenberger thumbed through the newspaper as he ate a
breakfast burrito. He said he's leaning against Valley cityhood
because he doesn't believe secessionists have a detailed plan for the
new city.</TE>
<TE>   "For us to be able to do it, we really have to make sure we're
strong on our feet," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's losing support in the Valley, that does make me wonder.
If everybody isn't going to support it, then it's not going to work."</TE>
<TE>   A few miles away in Studio City, Mariel Sloatman and her husband,
Vincent Eads, agreed that breaking off from Los Angeles was not a
wise idea.</TE>
<TE>   Sloatman said that initially she was intrigued by the notion of
cityhood. But once she learned secession would have no effect on the
troubled Los Angeles Unified School District, she decided to oppose
it.</TE>
<TE>   "To pass it would enhance people's feelings that the Valley is
different, when in fact we're not," Eads added. "We're just one big
melting pot."</TE>
<TE>   Diane Sherlock, a Studio City novelist, said she was already
leaning against a breakup when she got her sample ballot in the mail.
Sherlock said her mind was made up when she saw the list of political
novices seeking seats in the proposed Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't recognize any of the names," she said.</TE>
<TE>   To win, secession must claim a majority of voters both citywide
and in the proposed breakaway area.</TE>
<TE>   Enthusiasm for the idea has never been strong citywide. That has
left Mayor James K. Hahn's $5-million L.A. United campaign and other
opponents of secession to increasingly focus their efforts on the
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's campaign has homed in on Valley senior citizens, renters,
Latinos and union members with messages tailored to each group
warning about secession's uncertainties.</TE>
<TE>   The poll findings suggest the strategy is paying off. In the
Valley, support for secession has dropped among the elderly, Latinos
and less-affluent voters.</TE>
<TE>   Ana Soriano, who moved to Pacoima 27 years ago from El Salvador,
said she fears a new Valley city would later split into smaller
cities, abandoning the area's low-income residents and segregating
communities based on race.</TE>
<TE>   "Secessionists don't have an interest in the northeast Valley,"
Soriano said. "They have an interest in themselves. I don't trust
them to have control of the resources."</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists have denounced the mayor's approach as
"fear-mongering," and several breakaway backers voiced bitterness
Wednesday over the wave of anti-secession phone calls, mailers and
television ads.</TE>
<TE>   "The more money you have, the more power you have," said secession
backer Mary Margaret Finnan, a manager at Gilbert Costumes in North
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got people on the phone, they've got people in grocery
stores handing out fliers, they've got people out there speaking
Spanish," said Finnan, who lives in Van Nuys. "It's all about
communication."</TE>
<TE>   Valley secession leaders said Wednesday that they were not
discouraged by the Times poll results, saying other surveys showed
more support for the breakaway measure.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the anti-secession campaign right where we want them,
cocky and overconfident," said Carlos Ferreyra, co-chairman of the
Valley Independence Committee. He said the campaign recently began
airing television commercials on Valley cable systems.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood separatists insisted Wednesday a breakup has widespread
support in Hollywood. "People understand that Hollywood has been
abandoned to drug dealers, gangs and the prostitution business," the
Hollywood Independence Committee said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   At City Hall, Councilman Dennis Zine and others countered that
public opinion has turned against secession.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very pleased that the people are finally realizing that the
quick fix of secession is not the answer," said Zine, who lives in
West Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Hahn said if secession fails he will seek
legislation to prevent another vote on the matter in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing is enormously expensive for taxpayers," said Hahn, who
put the cost of studying secession at more than $3 million. "We ought
to have some reasonable interval before another effort is allowed."</TE>
<TE>   His remarks sparked angry criticism Wednesday from secession
leaders. At a Granada Hills news conference, separatists castigated
Hahn for suggesting new laws to block secession.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really thwarting the democratic process," Robert Lamishaw, a
Valley city council candidate, said.</TE>
<TE>   Former Assemblywoman Paula Boland, who is also running for a
council seat, said her phone has been "ringing off the hook" with
calls from people outraged by Hahn's remarks.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be the battle cry of all people in the Valley," Boland
said. "It's not a matter of win or lose on this."</TE>
<TE>   Even if voters reject secession, some supporters -- particularly
in the West Valley -- said they would back another breakaway
movement.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Baker, a 72-year-old West Hills homeowner with a "Mel
Wilson for Mayor" sign on his front lawn, said Valley cityhood would
wipe away the crime and graffiti staining the area.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't use to be this way," said Baker, who has lived in the
Valley for 45 years. "I will absolutely support secession again. I am
not living in a cocoon. I know what's going on. The Valley pays too
much in taxes. We don't need the power-hungry people downtown."</TE>
<TE>   Rosie Gutierrez, a renter who lives in a cramped Canoga Park
apartment complex, said the cityhood movement has boosted the
Valley's fortunes -- even though she doubts secession will pass.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting downtown to pay more attention to us," she said.
"I'm tired of the Valley being ignored."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Patrick McGreevy and Caitlin Liu contributed

<LD>A Ventura County sheriff's K-9 unit dog, responsible for sniffing out
dozens of pounds of illegal drugs, has returned home after undergoing
a life-saving emergency operation.</LD>
<LD>   The 5-year-old German shepherd, who is partnered with Senior
Deputy Anthony Aguirre, had surgery Sept. 26 for a knotted colon,
often a fatal condition in dogs. He was released Monday from Anacapa
Animal Hospital in Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a miracle that Edi is with us today -- I'm still amazed,"
said Dr. Ron Dalzell, who operated on the dog. Dalzell did not charge
the department for the $12,000 operation.</LD>
<TE>   The dog will convalesce at Aguirre's home, where he lives, and
could return to light duty within a month.</TE>

<HD>Water Purification System Ruled Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying that the amount of several trace elements found in Oxnard's
water was too small to pose any real danger, the City Council has
declined to take new purification measures that would have cost
millions of dollars.</LD>
<LD>   Nineteen elements were detected in the water, according to a
report to the California Department of Health Services. Of those, six
had average concentrations at levels above federal and state minimum
health standards, said Ken Ortega, Oxnard water superintendent.</LD>
<LD>   But each of those poses a very minimal health risk to consumers,
and purification efforts cannot guarantee a system completely free of
certain elements, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "You have a better chance of hitting the lottery" than getting
sick from the trace elements in the city's water supply, he said.</TE>
<TE>   It would have cost the city $254 million to $630 million in
capital expenditures and $15 million to $17 million in annual
operations and maintenance to approach lower levels of the elements,
Ortega said. The yearly cost of water for consumers would have
increased from about $220 to as much as $2,300.</TE>

<HD>Time to Break the Ice With Blake</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Wayne Gretzky's No. 99 finally took its rightful place high up
in Staples Center last week, it represented more than an honor for
the greatest player to ever wear a Kings sweater. It proved that
grand achievements and special memories mean more than hurt feelings.
It reminded us that the same should apply to Rob Blake.</LD>
<LD>   Blake's accomplishments merit a place alongside the retired
numbers of Gretzky, Dave Taylor, Marcel Dionne and Rogie Vachon.
Blake scored 138 goals, more than any other King defenseman, and in
1998 became the only King player to win the Norris Trophy as the
NHL's top defenseman.</LD>
<LD>   A jersey retirement requires more than good stats. It's about
representing the team, and Blake became the Kings' most identifiable
player in the gap between the Gretzky era and this current group.</LD>
<TE>   "Rob Blake's jersey should be up there for sure," said current
King captain Mattias Norstrom. "No question, he's the franchise's
best defenseman."</TE>
<TE>   But before that number goes to the wall, there's some patchwork to
do. Not on the jersey itself, but on Blake's relationship with King
fans.</TE>
<TE>   It's tough to picture a warm and fuzzy night honoring Blake
because right now you can't imagine him stepping on the Staples
Center ice without the fans booing.</TE>
<TE>   It's time to fix it, and it can start tonight when Blake and the
Colorado Avalanche play the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Blake should toss a verbal bouquet to the fans, let them know how
much he enjoyed playing for them and remind them they shouldn't take
his decision to leave personally. He wouldn't comment for this
column.</TE>
<TE>   The fans don't have to do a thing to make peace. Silence would
speak volumes.</TE>
<TE>   Norstrom hears the boos, and he has only one question.</TE>
<TE>   "Why?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "For a guy that's done so much for this organization and been just
a great ambassador for hockey in Southern California. He's been part
of the community, still is, he lives here in the summertime. That's
why I personally have a hard time understanding why they're still
booing him."</TE>
<TE>   Mario Valdez can explain why he and the rest of the fans in
Section 316 boo Blake every chance they get.</TE>
<TE>   "Because he's a traitor," Valdez said.</TE>
<TE>   Even his wife Nancy, who thinks Blake's jersey should be retired,
says, "We still have to boo him.... Let him know we're still hurt."</TE>
<TE>   We know where the relationship went sour. Blake removed the
captain's "C" from his sweater during contentious contract
negotiations in the 2000-01 season, and after it became clear the two
sides wouldn't reach an agreement the Kings traded him to the
Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's almost as if all the joy and goodwill he generated in the
decade he spent with the Kings didn't happen. Whenever he handles the
puck at Staples Center the fans rain boos on him. It's not just
because he's playing for the Avalanche, the team that knocked the
Kings out of the playoffs the last two seasons. The King fans even
booed him when he represented North America in the NHL All-Star game
in February.</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to see why the anger still lingers.</TE>
<TE>   Blake and King management got over it. He won a Stanley Cup and
signed a five-year, $47.5-million contract with Colorado. The trade
helped the Kings win their first playoff series since 1993 two years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Time and a better understanding helped Gretzky drop his resentment
for the way the new ownership group led by Phil Anschutz and Ed Roski
traded him in 1996. If Gretzky's jersey retirement represented a
public mending of that relationship, it also was a more discreet sign
of the healing between Blake and the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to attend a celebratory dinner two days before the
season opener last week but couldn't find commercial flights that
would get him from Denver and back without missing Avalanche
practice. So King President Tim Leiweke offered Blake a seat on
Anschutz's private jet.</TE>
<TE>   As they flew to L.A. they joked about the amount of money
Avalanche goaltender Patrick Roy lost in Las Vegas when the Kings and
Colorado played an exhibition game there.</TE>
<TE>   Then they got to talking about Gretzky's jersey retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "I did mention to him that there's going to be a day and time we
do this for him, and how much we appreciate him coming back," Leiweke
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some fans appear ready to make amends. Blake was so well received
by some season ticket holders at the Gretzky dinner that he stayed to
talk with them instead of moving to a VIP reception.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Briceno even wore Blake's No. 4 to the Kings' season
opener.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't blame the guy," Briceno said. "It's almost like the fans
expect so much loyalty. You can't expect a guy to give up millions of
dollars. That's not realistic."</TE>
<TE>   Blake has come to accept the booing.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing you can do about it, so I don't care about it
anymore," Blake told the Denver Post recently.</TE>
<TE>   The fans made their point. Any further booing is pointless.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings have had more success without Blake in the last two
seasons than they did with him in the previous seven seasons, so it's
not as if he left the franchise in the dumps.</TE>
<TE>   But in order to cheer for what he did as a King, he first must
stop being booed for every step he takes with the Avalanche.</TE>

<KH>WORLD SERIES * ANGELS VS. SAN FRANCISCO</KH>
<HD>Giants Not Jumping for Monkey Joy</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>Hate the rally monkey? Blame the San Francisco Giants.</LD>
<LD>   When the Angels' mischievous monkey mascot appears on the
scoreboard, the crowds at Edison Field go bananas. Fans deliriously
twirl stuffed monkeys in the air.</LD>
<LD>   And, with the Giants in town for the World Series, the Angels sent
out a news release recalling the origin of the monkey.</LD>
<TE>   Two years ago, during an interleague game against the Giants, two
guys on the Angel video crew were goofing around. They slapped the
words "rally monkey" onto an image of a monkey jumping up and down,
flashed the clip on the video board and the crowd went nuts.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels rallied from a 4-1 deficit to tie the score. After the
Giants took a 5-4 lead in the top of the ninth, the Angels rallied to
win in the bottom of the ninth, scoring twice off San Francisco
closer Robb Nen.</TE>
<TE>   If Nen does not blow that save, perhaps the rally monkey never is
heard from again. Nen did not care to discuss the monkey Wednesday,
but two teammates did.</TE>
<TE>   "The monkey doesn't go out there and play," outfielder Marvin
Benard said. "It's like USC football. Sometimes they're down, and all
of a sudden they play their chant and everybody goes nuts. It's just
an inspirational thing."</TE>
<TE>   First baseman J.T. Snow was amused that the Angels are reminding
people that the Giants were the first victim of the monkey.</TE>
<TE>   "I think somebody's got a lot of time on their hands," Snow said.
"Maybe it's fate. Maybe it's good. Maybe they'll have to put that
monkey up there a lot because we're winning."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Lackey will be available in the bullpen for Game 1 Saturday.
In the division series, in his only relief appearance in the major or
minor leagues, Lackey pitched three shutout innings.</TE>
<TE>   If he does not appear in relief, Lackey will make his Game 4 start
on 10 days' rest. As expected, the Angels will stick with the same
rotation they used in the league championship series, with Jarrod
Washburn starting Game 1, Kevin Appier Game 2 and Ramon Ortiz Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Finley finally made it to the World Series -- as a catcher.
During his 14 years with the Angels, Finley won 165 games, a
franchise record. If the St. Louis Cardinals had won the National
League championship series, Finley would have pitched against his old
team in the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   But the Cardinals lost, so the Angels invited Finley to catch the
ceremonial first pitch before Game 1. The pitcher will be Jackie
Autry, widow of the Angels' founding owner, Gene Autry.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pitching coach Bud Black, who withdrew from consideration for the
Cleveland Indians' managerial vacancy, might be receptive to interest
from the Seattle Mariners. Black grew up in Washington and made his
major league debut with the Mariners in 1981. The Mariners do not
plan to start their managerial search in earnest until next week....
The Giants are scheduled to arrive in Anaheim today and work out at
Edison Field tonight.</TE>

<HD>Wright Cut by Indians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Cleveland Indians on Wednesday declined to pick up their 2003
contract option on right-handed pitcher Jaret Wright, a former
Anaheim Katella High standout whose career has been slowed by
injuries.</LD>
<LD>   Wright, son of former Angel left-hander Clyde Wright, has been on
the disabled list seven times since 1999. He declined to be
outrighted and will file for free agency, the Indians said.</LD>
<LD>   Cleveland had a $6-million option on Wright for 2003.</LD>
<TE>   Indian General Manager Mark Shapiro said the team could possibly
sign Wright as a free agent.</TE>
<TE>   Wright is open to the idea of returning to the Indians as a free
agent, Shapiro said.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe he'll be a successful major league pitcher again,"
Shapiro said.</TE>
<TE>   Wright, 26, spent the first half of last season on the disabled
list because of shoulder problems. He has had two surgeries on the
shoulder since June 2000 and had an operation on his elbow in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In six starts for the Indians last season, Wright went 2-3 with a
15.71 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers acquired right-handed pitcher Brian Mallette to
complete the July trade with the Milwaukee Brewers for Tyler Houston
and minor league pitchers Ben Diggins and Shane Nance.</TE>
<TE>   Mallette, 27, made his major league debut April 12 at San
Francisco. He had no decisions and a 10.80 ERA in five games with the
Brewers, and was 3-2 with 25 saves and a 2.78 ERA at triple-A
Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ned Yost, a coach with the Atlanta Braves the last 12 years and a
member of the Brewers' 1982 American League championship team, became
the fourth candidate to interview for the Brewers' vacant managerial
job.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona coach Bob Melvin, New York Yankee coach Willie Randolph
and Brewer coach Cecil Cooper have interviewed with the team, which
plans to interview Oakland bench coach Ken Macha today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Padre closer Trevor Hoffman had arthroscopic surgery on
his right shoulder to clean up fraying in the rotator cuff and the
team expects him to be ready by spring training....Cincinnati Red
outfielder Wily Mo Pena is expected to have surgery Friday to repair
the left hamstring he tore while playing in the Arizona Fall League.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Ryan of the Boston Globe on baseball: "There are things wrong
with the presentation of the game and there is a built-in
institutional arrogance that refuses to acknowledge the harm that
needlessly long games can do.</LD>
<LD>   "Nevertheless, the essential beauty of the game endures. It is the
best combination of athleticism and intellectualism we ever have
known.</LD>
<LD>   "Baseball gives us more to chew on before, during and after each
game than basketball, football and hockey put together.</LD>
<TE>   "Dull? As Red Smith famously observed, 'Baseball is dull only to
those with dull minds.' "</TE>
<TE>   Do you agree? If not, write Ryan.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the Dodger who shares the record for stolen
bases in a World Series game with three?</TE>
<TE>   It's up to you, Lou: Gary Shelton of the St. Petersburg Times
making a case for Lou Piniella to manage the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
rather than the New York Mets:</TE>
<TE>   * "Because a lot of people can win in New York, even Bobby
Valentine. Because only Piniella can win here.</TE>
<TE>   * "Because in New York, he'd be healing the sick. Because here,
he'd be healing the dead."</TE>
<TE>   What's wrong with them? Ike Nwankwo, a 6-foot-10 rookie in camp
with the Cleveland Cavaliers, will never forget his debut in Turkey's
pro league. That night a goat was taken to center court.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a mascot," Nwankwo told the Cleveland Plain
Dealer. "They cut his throat and I couldn't believe it.</TE>
<TE>   "The coach told the players to get some of the blood and put it on
their head for good luck. I wouldn't do it and they looked at me like
I was crazy. They wondered what was wrong with me."</TE>
<TE>   Elite company: Adam Kennedy, the Angels' second baseman, was asked
on Fox Sports Net's "Best Damn Sports Show Period" what it was like
to be included with Babe Ruth, Reggie Jackson and George Brett as
players who have hit three home runs in a postseason game.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't quite fit, huh," he said. "Pick out the name that
doesn't belong."</TE>
<TE>   Lots of splashes: From comedy writer Jerry Perisho: "Coaches with
the Angels say their team will pitch to San Francisco Giant slugger
Barry Bonds during the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "For the very first time, you'll see gridlock with boats in
McCovey Cove."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1942, UCLA defeated California, 21-0,
at Berkeley. The Bruins went on to win the Pacific Coast Conference
championship before losing to Georgia, 9-0, in the Rose Bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Willie Davis, on Oct. 11, 1965, against Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: After Terrell Owens caught the winning touchdown pass
for the 49ers Monday night, he pulled a pen from his sock,
autographed the ball and handed it to his financial advisor in the
stands.</TE>
<TE>   Said comedy writer Alex Kaseberg to the San Francisco Chronicle:
"This is the first time a player had signed something on the field
since former Baltimore Raven Tony Siragusa used his credit card to
order pizza delivered in the huddle."</TE>

<LD>Wang Zhizhi is expected to become a Clipper at 9:01 tonight, when the
15-day deadline runs out for the Dallas Mavericks to match a
three-year offer sheet worth $6 million. The Clippers have scheduled
a formal announcement of Wang's acquisition for Friday morning, along
with a second personnel move that will keep their roster at the
20-player maximum for training camp.</LD>
<LD>   Wang is expected to practice with the team Monday and to be
available for the final exhibition game Wednesday against the
Milwaukee Bucks at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   "They have through the 17th to decide whether to match," Joe
Safety, Clipper vice president of communications, said Wednesday.
"All we can do is wait."</LD>
<TE>   Mark Cuban, owner of the Mavericks, was considerably less formal
in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is he didn't want to be here," Cuban said of
Wang, a 7-foot-1 center from China who last season averaged 5.6
points in 55 games for the Mavericks. "He wanted to go someplace
where he could get a lot of minutes. It would be good to have him,
but we're not going to miss him. We'll find the two or three points
from someone else."</TE>
<TE>   Wang will give the injury-plagued Clippers some needed depth. The
team lost to the Bucks, 98-76, Wednesday night in the first of a
three-game exhibition trip with starting forwards Lamar Odom and
Elton Brand and center Michael Olowokandi sidelined because of leg
injuries. All three may miss the regular-season opener Oct. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Elgin Baylor, Clipper general manager, became interested in
signing Wang after seeing him play in the summer league at Long Beach
State. Wang joined the Golden State Warriors' summer league team
rather than play with the Chinese national team in the World
Championships last month. Last week, China suspended Wang for his
desire to play with the Clippers instead of with the national team at
the Asian Games.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Louisiana State quarterback Matt Mauck will be out indefinitely after
injuring his right foot in the 14th-ranked Tigers' victory over
Florida on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Mauck, who has guided the Tigers to five consecutive victories
after an opening loss to Virginia Tech, was injured with 7 1/2
minutes remaining and the Tigers leading, 36-7.</LD>
<LD>   "The evaluation on Tuesday showed he has a significant injury to
the mid-foot," team doctor Brent Bankston said Wednesday. "At this
time, he will be out indefinitely and will undergo further testing to
determine if surgery is necessary."</LD>
<TE>   Marcus Randall will start at quarterback for the Tigers on
Saturday against South Carolina. Randall has appeared in four games
and is four-of-eight passing for 33 yards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Florida quarterback Rex Grossman, who has a sprained right knee,
practiced for the first time this week and should be healthy enough
to start Saturday against Auburn.... Kevin Johnson, a starting
cornerback for Clemson, has been dismissed from the team for academic
reasons.... Nebraska running back Thunder Collins didn't report to
practice for a third day in a row, increasing speculation that he has
quit the team.... Ohio State linebacker Fred Pagac Jr., who was
suspended for Saturday's game against Wisconsin, pleaded innocent to
charges of persistent disorderly conduct.... Colorado running back
Marcus Houston, whose career has been marred because of injury, says
he has no plans to transfer.... Miami tailback Willis McGahee did not
participate in practice because of turf toe on his right foot. The
No. 1-ranked Hurricanes have an open date this week.... An
unidentified man who fell about 30 feet from the upper deck of the
Orange Bowl during Miami's game against Connecticut on Oct. 5 has
died, police said.</TE>

<LD>A consumer's guide to the best and worst of sports media and
merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, played, heard,
observed, worn, viewed, dialed or downloaded, it's in play here. One
exception: No products will be endorsed.</LD>
<LD>   What: "Major League Remodel"</LD>
<LD>   Where: Do It Yourself Network</LD>
<TE>   When: Friday, 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Shows on Do It Yourself, a sister channel to Home and Garden
Television and the Food Network, can be about as exciting as watching
paint dry. But if you happen to be someone who has thought about
turning a room in your home into a multimedia entertainment center
and sports memorabilia room, this one-hour show may be worth
watching.</TE>
<TE>   Greg McMichael, a relief pitcher who spent eight years in the
majors, is the host. He shows viewers what he and some friends,
including former Minnesota Viking kicker Fuad Reveiz, did with his
unused, unfinished basement in his Atlanta home.</TE>
<TE>   A wet bar is created from plywood and chain-link fencing and bats
are used to make a foot railing. Jennifer McMichael uses baseball
cards, magazine covers and newspaper articles, plus a lot of varnish,
to decorate the top of the bar.</TE>
<TE>   The gang also builds a special bat rack and adds a built-in
bookcase that can hold a 56-inch TV. Memorabilia broker Tony Cocchi
and Hard Rock Cafe designer Christine Gould offer tips on displaying
and caring for baseball collectibles.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the room is a nice place for McMichael to show off his
memorabilia, trophies and rings. This could turn out to be something
Angel players might want to look into.</TE>

<LD>Each season produces at least one team that catches the world off
guard and you could say this year's surprise definitely came out of
the (wild) blue (yonder).</LD>
<LD>   Our storybook team is climbing fast in the polls after starting
unranked.</LD>
<LD>   Our team is coming off a nonwinning season and figured to have
been eliminated from bowl championship series consideration on Sept.
14.</LD>
<TE>   Our team has won its way into hearts and minds and, more
important, into ESPN's late-night Saturday time slot.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame?</TE>
<TE>   OK, technically the Irish also qualify as overachieving upstarts
-- an unranked team coming off a nonwinning season -- but we were
thinking more of Notre Dame's opponent this week, Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force is 6-0, ranked 18th and different from Notre Dame (6-0
and No. 7) if only because the Irish don't turn away recruits who
can't fit into jet fighter cockpits.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force remains an anomaly in that it leads the nation in
rushing while it continues to confound its two service academies
rivals, Army and Navy.</TE>
<TE>   How and why Air Force has managed to produce top-flight pilots and
a quality football program has Pentagon generals scratching their
heads.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, there's a lot of bragging rights among the service
academies," Chad Hennings, the former Air Force and Dallas Cowboy
player, said this week. "It's always good just to rub it in their
faces, basically."</TE>
<TE>   Here's the rub:</TE>
<TE>   Since he took over as Air Force coach in 1984, Fisher DeBerry is
147-78-1 and has a 31-6 record against Army and Navy.</TE>
<TE>   DeBerry has won more games than any other service academy coach,
including Army's famed Red Blaik.</TE>
<TE>   DeBerry has had only two nonwinning seasons -- last year's team
was 6-6 -- has taken the Falcons to 11 bowl games, and has
accomplished all this while Army and Navy have done about-faces.</TE>
<TE>   Army, 0-6 this year, has had only eight winning seasons since
1984, is 14-47 since 1997 and was 1-10 as recently as 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Navy, 1-15 in its last 16 games, has had six coaches who have
amassed a record of 73-159-1 since 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force, meanwhile, does not only have a model program among the
service academies; it has a model program, period.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the Falcons seem a cinch to wrap up their sixth
consecutive Commander in Chief's trophy and may be on the precipice
of breaking the BCS sound barrier.</TE>
<TE>   A victory over Notre Dame in Colorado Springs on Saturday would
put Air Force in rarefied air.</TE>
<TE>   "Their season is pivoting on this one," Hennings said. "If they
get by this one, they are positioning themselves for great things."</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame has a 20-5 record against Air Force but has always
struggled against the option attack. The last two meetings were
decided in overtime, Air Force winning at Notre Dame in 1996 and
losing in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   DeBerry's triple option, which infuriates opposing coordinators
used to stopping conventional offenses, has never been better. The
Falcons average a nation-leading 339.2 yards rushing a game, led by
junior quarterback Chance Harridge, who has scored 15 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force has crushed Northwestern, 52-3; upset California, 23-21,
and last week exacted 52-9 revenge against Brigham Young, which
scored a 30-point victory last year.</TE>
<TE>   "You're never going to stop that offense," Cal Coach Jeff Tedford
said after losing to Air Force on Sept. 21.</TE>
<TE>   DeBerry's options are limited, though, he says, because the
academy cannot compete with other Division I-A programs for top-notch
players.</TE>
<TE>   "We're never going to be as big as any of our opponents, but that
doesn't mean we can't be as quick or not run as well, or certainly be
as strong," DeBerry said.</TE>
<TE>   Because some Air Force players become jet pilots, the academy is
restricted as to the size of the players it recruits. DeBerry says
the academy can beef players up while they're playing football--a
230-pound freshman may gain 40 pounds--but those players must lose
that weight before graduation to meet academy limits.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a challenge to them every spring, our seniors, to lose their
weight," DeBerry said.</TE>
<TE>   To counter the size disadvantage, Air Force has employed a
precision option attack in an era when most major college schools
have become pass-happy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not something opposing teams see every week," DeBerry said.</TE>
<TE>   So What Gives?</TE>
<TE>   Army and Navy, while running similar offenses, have largely failed
to match Air Force's success and, frankly, they're not happy about it
(Army recently dumped the option for a more conventional offense).</TE>
<TE>   Privately, while praising DeBerry's success, officials from the
rival academies grumble about Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   One Army insider said, "Young guys want to fly jets, not drive
tanks."</TE>
<TE>   A Navy man said Air Force simply puts more emphasis on football
while Navy's answer "has been to fire the coach."</TE>
<TE>   Other advantages?</TE>
<TE>   * Army and Navy followers note that Air Force's prep school, which
feeds nonqualifiers into the academy, is right across the street.
(Navy's is in Rhode Island.)</TE>
<TE>   * Unlike the other academies, Air Force allows players with NFL
potential out of their military commitments after two years, making
it a more desirable destination for players with pro aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   * Conference ties. Years ago, Air Force figured out the benefits
of conference membership. A longtime member of the Western Athletic
Conference, Air Force is now in the Mountain West, generally
considered the best of the non-BCS conferences. This is also an
advantage in attracting players. To keep up, Army recently joined
Conference USA. Navy, however, remains an independent.</TE>
<TE>   * Geography. Air Force is closer to two of the three best
recruiting hotbeds in the country, Texas and California. Thirty
players on this year's Air Force roster are from those two states.</TE>
<TE>   * Academic standards. Army and Navy claim that Air Force is easier</TE>
<TE>   .* Float-your-boat theory. Air Force players get to remain in the
United States after graduation, whereas Navy recruits may end up on
the high seas.</TE>
<TE>   "Air Force coaches tell recruits, 'You don't have to go on a ship
for six months,' " the Navy man said. "That's a factor."</TE>
<TE>   * Fisher DeBerry. There's no substitute for consistency. Air Force
has had one coach, running the same offense, for more than 18 years.</TE>
<TE>   "That's important," DeBerry said, "because it takes you a couple
of years to learn to recruit at an academy."</TE>
<TE>   Hurry-Up Offense</TE>
<TE>   Fun with numbers: The combined record of the current and former
Florida football coaches is 6-6. Ron Zook is 4-3 in his first year
with the Gators and Steve Spurrier's Washington Redskins are 2-3.
Here's why Spurrier will get more time to turn things around: Zook
has already lost two home games this year by a total of 54 points. In
12 years at Florida, Spurrier lost five home games by a total of 25
points.</TE>
<TE>   More on this week's game of the week: Air Force averages 339 yards
a game rushing; Notre Dame's defense has given up only 457 rushing
yards all season. Air Force gained 476 yards rushing in one game,
against Northwestern.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force junior quarterback Harridge, an unheralded player from
Houston County High in Bonaire, Ga., says one of his favorite
all-time movies is "Rudy." Harridge, however, says he will not seek
inspiration from the film this week. Harridge is already being
compared to some of the great Air Force option quarterbacks, among
them Blane Morgan. "I've only had six games," Harridge says. "Ask me
that after my career is over."</TE>
<TE>   There could very well be another mess this year in the BCS
standings, which will be unveiled Monday. There are 10 unbeaten
Division I teams remaining but only two potential head-to-head,
regular-season matchups: We know a loser will emerge from Notre
Dame-Air Force, but Miami and Virginia Tech could be undefeated when
they play Dec. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Air Force nor Bowling Green has a flying Falcon's chance
to play for the national title, even if both teams go undefeated,
leaving eight remaining undefeated teams jockeying for national title
position.</TE>
<TE>   Quick handicap of the Fiesta Bowl field: 1. Miami-Virginia Tech
winner. Miami has only one tough game, Nov. 9 at suddenly so-so
Tennessee, and Virginia Tech should be undefeated headed into Miami.
2. Ohio State. The Buckeyes are at Wisconsin this week but the only
other tests, Penn State and Michigan, are in Columbus. 3. Georgia.
The Bulldogs are in good shape as it stands, but must play Kentucky,
Auburn, Florida, Mississippi and possibly in the Southeastern title
game. 4. Oklahoma. The Sooners are a likely Fiesta Bowl cinch if they
run the table, but is that possible with a quarterback, Nate Hybl,
who tossed four interceptions in last week's 35-24 victory over Texas
and afterward commented, "It was awesome to see them execute, in
spite of me"? 5. Notre Dame. The Irish have three possible losses
left on the schedule: Air Force, Florida State and USC. 6. Oregon.
The Ducks' lack of schedule strength is going to hurt them in the
BCS. 7. North Carolina State. Can't make the Fiesta Bowl unless it
keeps winning and a lot of other teams lose.</TE>
<TE>   The six BCS computers in operation are all over the map in
assessments of Bowling Green. The Falcons rank ninth in Richard
Billingsley's index this week and 63rd in the New York Times computer
rankings. Bowling Green ranks 31st in Sagarin, 16th in Wes Colley's
index, 20th in the Massey ratings and 15th in Anderson-Hester.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame remains No. 1 in the New York Times and Anderson-Hester
rankings, Miami is No. 1 in Billingsley and Massey, and Georgia is
tops in Sagarin and Colley.</TE>

<KH>WORLD SERIES * ANGELS VS. SAN FRANCISCO</KH>
<HD>Baker Goes to Schmidt for Game 1</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- Questions, questions, questions.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco Giant Manager Dusty Baker had only one answer
Wednesday. Right-hander Jason Schmidt will open the World Series
Saturday against the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   Baker said he will use a four-man rotation, which will also
include Russ Ortiz, Livan Hernandez and Kirk Rueter, but wouldn't
reveal the order of the rotation.</LD>
<TE>   Baker said that decision, along with the choice of designated
hitters for the games at Anaheim and any roster moves, would be
finalized in a meeting with his coaches later in the day.</TE>
<TE>   After beginning the season at triple-A Fresno, Schmidt wound up
13-8 with the Giants with a 3.45 earned-run average. He struck out
196 and walked 73 in 185 1/3 innings. In the postseason, Schmidt is
1-1 with a 3.46 ERA. Schmidt, who was scheduled to pitch Game 6 of
the National League championship series if it had gone that far, beat
St. Louis in Game 2, 4-1, holding the Cardinals to four hits and a
run in 7 2/3 innings. Throwing 119 pitches, Schmidt struck out eight
and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown has already thrown out the first
insult of the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course I would have rather had us playing New York," he told
the San Francisco Chronicle. "Can you imagine the embarrassment if we
lose to Anaheim?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The spirit of the postseason glows from San Francisco's City Hall.
The building is lit up at night in bright orange for the duration of
the World Series. With the contrasting background of the night sky,
the scene matches the Giant colors of orange and black.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tickets for the games at Pacific Bell Park have been raised to
more than seven times the regular-season rates, in some cases.</TE>
<TE>   An upper-deck seat, normally $17, will run $125 for the World
Series. Bleacher seats, normally $9 to $13, will go for $60.</TE>
<TE>   And that's before the scalpers get hold of them.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to avoid long lines of ticket seekers around the park, the
Giants gave out numbered orange wristbands Monday. Seven thousand
tickets went on sale Wednesday with another seven thousand being sold
over the phone or online.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't work. Fans without wristbands still camped out at the
ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Giants are flying today and will work out at Edison Field from
5 to 7 p.m.</TE>

<LD>Michael Haddan of Irvine Woodbridge will be allowed to run in the
boys' sweepstakes race of the Orange Country cross-country
championships on Saturday at Irvine Regional Park.</LD>
<LD>   The sweepstakes races are usually comprised of the top 15-ranked
boys' and girls' teams in Orange County. But county coaches voted
Tuesday night to allow Haddan, whose team is not among the top 15 in
the county, to run in the sweepstakes event so he can compete against
top runners such as Juan Robles of Placentia Valencia, David Napper
of Cypress and Mike Chavez of Anaheim Esperanza.</LD>
<LD>   Robles won the sweepstakes title in the Orange County
championships last year, but Haddan won the Division II race with a
time that was three seconds faster.</LD>

<TE>   The Hesperia Sultana girls' cross-country team has moved to third

<TE>   Murrieta Valley, which finished five points behind Sultana in the
sweepstakes race of the Inland Empire Challenge at Cucamonga-Guasti
Regional Park in Ontario on Saturday, is ranked 12th. Thousand Oaks
is 24th.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Poly, which won the sweepstakes race of the Clovis

<TE>   Rolling Hills Estates Peninsula junior Macall Harkins is expected
to play in a key Bay League girls' tennis match today against Beverly
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The versatile Harkins, who plays at No. 2 or 3 singles or No. 1
doubles for the Panthers (11-1, 4-0), has been bothered by left wrist
and shoulder injuries most of the season. She sat out the Panthers'
10-8 nonleague victory Wednesday over Dana Hills (8-2), the
top-ranked team in the Southern Section Division I poll, to ensure
she would be available against Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills (10-0, 4-0) is ranked No. 2 in Division I and No. 3
in The Times' rankings. Peninsula is No. 6 in both the Division I and
Times' rankings.</TE>
<TE>   "She came back and tried to play two matches in a row a couple
weeks ago, and it really kind of bothered her," Peninsula Coach Tom
Cox said.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Southern Section council this morning will vote on a proposal
that would restrict coaches to coaching only their own athletes in
out-of-season competition. Athletes would still be allowed to play
for club coaches unaffiliated with section schools.</TE>
<TE>   The council, during its regular meeting at The Grand in Long
Beach, will also vote on a golf proposal that would increase the
maximum number of allowable matches from 18 to 24. Under the
proposal, nine-hole matches against the same opponent held on
consecutive days would count as two matches instead of one.</TE>

<LD>   Huntington Beach (4-1) vs. Los Alamitos (4-0-1) at Long Beach
Veteran's Stadium, 7, tonight</LD>
<LD>   There's no secret to Huntington Beach's surprising success. The
Oilers hand the ball off to Patrick Harrigan every chance they get,
and the hard-nosed running back has responded by gaining 250 yards a
game, which leads the Southland. He was limited to 117 yards last
year during Los Alamitos' 42-7 victory and may need to pile up nearly
twice that many yards tonight for the Oilers to stay in this Sunset
League opener. The quarterback platoon for Los Alamitos, No. 4 in The
Times' rankings, became a one-man show last week when Justin Elway
injured his shoulder in a 34-26 victory over Carson. But Jeff Kline
(628 yards, five touchdown passes) should be able to handle things,
with receivers Jeremy Childs (504 yards) and Brandon Tripp (274) in
the mix.</LD>

<TE>   Santa Ana Mater Dei (4-1) vs. L.A. Loyola (5-0) at East L.A.
College, 7:30 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei tailback Rafael Rice will play his first game against
his former team, which is making its debut in the reconfigured Serra
League. Rice, averaging 76 yards a game, has never quite regained the
form he displayed last as a Loyola sophomore. Bo Renaud, then Rice's
backup, now carries the load for the run-oriented Cubs, averaging 7.2
yards an attempt while having scored 11 touchdowns for No. 2 Loyola.
Mater Dei quarterback Jason Forcier, who has completed 62.5% of his
passes for 474 yards and three touchdowns for the No. 14 Monarchs,
should throw away from speedy defensive back Quintin Daniels, who has
three interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>

<TE>   Rolling Hills Estates Peninsula (4-1) at Manhattan Beach Mira
Costa (5-0), 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Will Mira Costa's offense keep rolling in a Bay League opener? The
No. 9 Mustangs are averaging 48 points thanks to Michael Okwo, who
has 780 yards rushing and eight touchdowns, and Peter Dobush, who has
completed a sizzling 42 of 60 passes (70%) for 739 yards and 13
touchdowns. Peninsula will try to control the clock with junior
running back Jordan Munde, who is second in the Southland in yards
rushing, 998, and carries, 152. Peninsula has won three games in a
row since a 27-20 loss to Gardena Serra.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santa Fe Springs St. Paul (2-2-1) at Sherman Oaks Notre Dame
(5-0), 7:30 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   The two best teams in the Mission League meet in this league
opener. The offense of No. 20 Notre Dame keeps improving. One reason
is the play of sophomore tailback Cary Harris, who has broken off
touchdown runs of 73 and 76 yards in the last two weeks. St. Paul has
beaten Wilmington Banning and L.A. Roosevelt the last two games
because quarterback Kevin Davies, a transfer from La Canada St.
Francis, has added some stability to the offensive attack.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark (5-0) at Simi Valley Royal (3-2), 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark, which is 2-0 in league and trying to win its first
Marmonte title since joining the league in 1998, beat Newbury Park,
47-13, two weeks ago and recorded its third shutout of the season
with a 42-0 victory against Simi Valley last week. The Musketeers'
offense is led by Cliff Cardwell, who has rushed for 523 yards and
seven touchdowns, and Eddie Garcia, who has thrown for 606 yards and
eight touchdowns. Royal, also 2-0 in league, defeated Calabasas,
24-17, in overtime in its league opener and edged Newbury Park,
58-55, last week. Highlander quarterback Kyle Uebelhardt has thrown
for 1,311 yards and 14 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CITY SECTION</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson (3-2) at Crenshaw (2-3), 3 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Stopping Jefferson wide receiver Gary White will be one of the
objectives for Crenshaw's defense in this Coliseum League game.
White, a 6-foot-3 senior, caught a 35-yard game-winning touchdown
pass in the final minute to defeat Gardena last week. Running back
Daymeion Hughes is Crenshaw's top offensive threat and he accounted
for the only touchdown in a 7-6 loss to San Pedro last week.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Roosevelt (4-1) at Jordan (3-2), 3 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Coming off a victory over defending City champion Dorsey,
Roosevelt came crashing to earth with a 40-3 loss to St. Paul. Jordan
is coming off its own defeat against L.A. Wilson. Though this is an
Eastern League opener, these two are the title favorites. Each has
great offensive weapons: Roosevelt's running backs Jody Adewale and
Zach Owens and Jordan's quarterback Naquan Walker, wide receiver
Martail Burnett and all-purpose threat Micrin Lias.</TE>

<LD>EZRA BEATON</LD>
<LD>   School: Calabasas</LD>
<LD>   Ht.: 6-3 * Wt.: 250 * Year: Senior</LD>
<TE>   Few are better than Ezra Beaton when it comes to breaking the
tension of a pressure-packed moment.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, in his first junior varsity football scrimmage, the
Calabasas High defensive tackle and his teammates were gearing up to
stop North Hills L.A. Baptist on a fourth-and-one situation. During a
timeout, Coyote Coach Jeremy Sherman told his players they had to
toughen up because it was fourth down.</TE>
<TE>   Beaton asked the coach, "What's a fourth down?"</TE>
<TE>   The kid wasn't trying to be a wise guy. He really didn't know.</TE>
<TE>   "He came to us from South Africa as a rugby player," varsity Coach
Larry Edwards said. "The first football game he saw was the one he
played in."</TE>
<TE>   What Beaton lacked in knowledge he more than compensated for in
ability. Calabasas stuffed Baptist on the play, and the 6-foot-3,
250-pounder has since blossomed into a standout linebacker who is
being recruited by many Pacific-10 schools as a senior.</TE>
<TE>   "I get a feeling when I hit someone, and I want more and more,"
said Beaton, who has also played cricket and soccer but considers
American football his favorite sport. "I have great coaches. That's
how I got to know the game real fast."</TE>
<TE>   Edwards said Beaton, who has six sacks and an interception heading
into the Marmonte League game between Calabasas (3-2) and Thousand
Oaks (3-2) on Friday, "always seems to find the guy with the ball.
He's a dynamo with great speed and quickness."</TE>
<TE>   Beaton said his dream is to play for Miami, the top-ranked college
team in the country and the alma mater of Baltimore Raven linebacker
Ray Lewis, but the Hurricanes haven't shown interest. Beaton met
Lewis backstage after a concert put on by his father, Jonathan
Butler, a rhythm and blues musician.</TE>
<TE>   Wherever he ends up, the good-natured Beaton is likely to put a
smile on the faces of his teammates and coaches.</TE>

<HD>Roosevelt's Adewale Bound for USC</HD>

<AU>-- Eric Sondheimer, Eric Stephens and Dan Arritt</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the time Jody Adewale was a second-grader at an elementary
school across the street from USC, he has wanted to become a Trojan.</LD>
<LD>   It finally happened earlier this week when USC football Coach Pete
Carroll offered the Roosevelt High running back a scholarship.
Adewale, who is 6-foot and 215 pounds, quickly accepted.</LD>
<LD>   "My heart fell," Adewale said. "I almost started crying. Since
I've been little, I've wanted to go to that school."</LD>
<TE>   Another football player making his commitment was Harbor City
Narbonne's Antwan Applewhite, a 6-4, 220-pound defensive end who
chose San Diego State.</TE>
<TE>   Brea Olinda's Evan Moore, a 6-7 tight end in football and forward
in basketball, has committed to Stanford, where he will try both
sports.</TE>
<TE>   Allyson Felix of North Hills L.A. Baptist, the defending state
track champion in the 100 and 200 meters, has taken recruiting trips
to USC and South Carolina and plans to visit Stanford and Tennessee.
Her brother, Wes, runs track at USC.</TE>
<TE>   In baseball, Santa Ana Mater Dei pitcher Armando Carrasco has
committed to Cal State Fullerton, and teammate Louie Hernandez, a
third baseman, committed to UC Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Gabrielle Assayag, a senior at Irvine Northwood, has committed to
UCLA for women's rowing.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Burlingham, a Parade All-American in girls' soccer last season
from Newport Harbor, has committed to Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Crystal Erwin, a 6-2 power forward from Santa Fe Springs St. Paul,
is visiting UCLA this weekend. She is deciding from among the Bruins,
Notre Dame and Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   In softball, infielder Norrelle Dickson of Orange El Modena has
committed to Oklahoma, and teammates Jessica Hejna and Elizabeth
Walters, both outfielders, have committed to UC Santa Barbara.
Fullerton Rosary shortstop Lizzie Hagen, an All-Southern Section
Division IV selection last season, has committed to Pacific. Dayna
Feenstra, a first baseman at Artesia, has committed to Michigan
State.</TE>
<TE>   Wilmington Banning football Coach Ed Lalau said his standout
safety, A.J. Tuitele, is still firmly committed to Oregon despite
dropping by recently to watch a USC practice.</TE>

<HD>Damien Vies for the Spotlight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As expected, a Catholic school team wearing solid-colored helmets
offset by three white stripes is off to a tremendous start this
season. It is pulling out exhilarating victories and showing that it
could be a force in the Southern Section playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Only this team plays in the Sierra League, not the Serra League,
and its helmet stripes stand for faith, family and football instead
of pride, poise and courage.</LD>
<LD>   While Santa Ana Mater Dei continues to pound opponents in ho-hum
fashion, La Verne Damien is enjoying a renaissance after upsetting La
Puente Bishop Amat and positioning itself potentially as the next
Catholic school power.</LD>
<TE>   "We're out to make a point," Spartan linebacker John Galaz said.
"We feel we should have the recognition that [Serra League schools]
have. We want to show everyone that we are capable of what they are."</TE>
<TE>   Best known recently as the school that produced Rashidi Wheeler,
the Northwestern safety who collapsed and died in August 2001 while
running wind sprints, Damien is putting the focus back on its program
as it vies for its second section title since capturing the
Southeastern Conference championship in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   The Spartans (4-1), No. 22 in The Times' rankings, open Sierra
League play Friday when they host Diamond Bar (4-1).</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Sierra League, which also includes No. 3 Chino
(5-0) and No. 23 Chino Hills Ayala (4-1), is plenty tough, some
observers think Damien would be a better fit in the all-Catholic
Serra League.</TE>
<TE>   The enrollment at the all-boys' school is larger than Anaheim
Servite's and comparable to that of Los Angeles Loyola and Bellflower
St. John Bosco--two other Serra League schools--but its players and
coaches have little desire to switch leagues for reasons that go
beyond the transportation dilemma.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we could be competitive in that league year in and
year out," Damien Coach Mark Pasquarella said. "We have a few teams
that come through here once in a while that could play at that level.
When I took this job, that was the goal--getting to the point where
we could play at that level every year."</TE>
<TE>   The Spartans might not be at that level yet, but they're getting
close. Two weeks ago they defeated Bishop Amat, then No. 15 in The
Times' rankings, after senior cornerback Dorian Greene tipped away a
Lancer pass with 20 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "Beating Bishop Amat was a satisfying accomplishment," said Father
Patrick Travers, Damien's principal. "There is an excitement on
campus."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the buzz has been generated by additional last-minute
victories over Rancho Cucamonga and Claremont.</TE>
<TE>   "I would never count us out because we play with a lot of heart,"
said senior Chris Powers, a two-way lineman who anchors what
Pasquarella has labeled the best offensive line in his 14 years as a
coach. "We stick together and play as a team."</TE>
<TE>   Damien's success is all the more amazing considering that starting
quarterback Nick Davila was lost with a broken clavicle the second
week of the season. The Spartans have won three of four games with
backup Mark Belanger, who had four passes intercepted in a 19-14 loss
to No. 21 Covina Charter Oak. Davila has been cleared to practice but
will not play until next week at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   The Spartans have turned to their running game in Davila's
absence. Junior Ian Johnson hasn't disappointed, rushing for 552
yards and seven touchdowns on the season.</TE>
<TE>   The team's biggest test comes in two weeks at Chino. If the
Spartans win there, they could be top-seeded heading into the
Division II playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the year to make our name," Greene said. "We just know
that our time to shine is coming."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Baldwin Park Coach Tony Zane, barred three weeks ago from
coaching the team he has guided for 30 years after Baldwin Park
Unified School District officials discovered he had an irregular
heartbeat, is meeting with district officials this afternoon to learn
whether he will be reinstated.</TE>
<TE>   Zane, who is 61 and takes medication for his condition, has
submitted a letter from his doctor explaining he is not suffering
from heart disease and has not suffered a heart attack, as was
rumored on campus.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Larry Davis has coached the Braves (0-4-1), who play
host to Valle Vista League rival Pomona Ganesha (4-1) on Friday, in
Zane's absence.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Westlake Village Oaks Christian running back Aaron Ware is
expected to return this week after missing four games with torn and
strained hip muscles.</TE>
<TE>   Ware, a sophomore who rushed for 223 yards in 11 carries during
the Lions' opener before injuring his left hip late in the second
quarter, is expected to be eased back into competition Saturday when
Oaks Christian (5-0) plays Lompoc Cabrillo (1-5) in a nonleague game
at Lompoc High, Lion Coach Bill Redell said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about 85 to 90%," said Ware, who gained 1,858 yards in 165
carries last season. "I thought I was out for the season when it
happened. It hurt that much. But all in all, it's been going really
good, and this week, it hasn't been hurting me at all."</TE>
<TE>   Senior Adam Richter will again start at running back Saturday. In
Ware's absence, Richter has rushed for 940 yards, the fourth-highest
total in the Southland.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Brad Sievert of Thousand Oaks is expected to play in

<KH>WORLD SERIES * ANGELS VS. SAN FRANCISCO</KH>
<HD>Angels' Infield-on-the-Fly Rules</HD>
<DH>No one is playing in his original position, but somehow
they have made it work well.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was "Angels in the Outfield," a bad Disney movie about a team
inspired by arm-flapping fans, and now there is Angels in the
Infield, a real-life story about a World Series-bound Angel quartet
that seems to have been spliced together in a studio editing room.</LD>
<LD>   When the Angels oppose the San Francisco Giants in Game 1 Saturday
night, they will have a third baseman playing first base, a shortstop
playing second, a second baseman playing shortstop and a shortstop
playing third.</LD>
<LD>   Confused? So were Angel infielders at times last season, when
their inexperience at certain positions led to some
rough-around-the-edges play and some doubts as to whether the moves
would stick in the long run.</LD>
<TE>   But with another full season in their respective spots, first
baseman Scott Spiezio, second baseman Adam Kennedy, shortstop David
Eckstein and third baseman Troy Glaus have jelled into a superb
infield; the Angels had the American League's second-best fielding
percentage (.986) this season and committed the second-fewest errors
(87).</TE>
<TE>   "It's a game of adjustments," Eckstein said, "and I guess we just
kept adjusting."</TE>
<TE>   No one more so than Eckstein, the 5-foot-7, 170-pound bundle of
energy who is the smallest of the group but was the biggest risk in
the Angels' musical-chairs-like infield alignment.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein, who played second for four years in Boston's farm system
before being claimed off waivers by the Angels on Aug. 16, 2000,
opened the 2001 season as the Angel second baseman while Kennedy
recovered from a spring-training hand injury.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein so impressed the Angels with his offensive spark,
defensive intuition and gritty play that the team had to find a spot
for him when Kennedy returned. But when first base coach Alfredo
Griffin suggested shortstop, Manager Mike Scioscia looked at Griffin
as if he had two heads.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Are you kidding me?' " Scioscia said. "But from the
first game he played shortstop for us early last year, he hasn't
looked back. He's been incredible."</TE>
<TE>   During the division series in New York, Yankee fans serenaded
Eckstein with chants of "Little Leaguer, Little Leaguer," and not
just because of his size. To compensate for his below-average arm,
Eckstein uses baseball's most exaggerated crow hop--it's more of a
hop, skip and a jump--before heaving the ball across the infield.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate watching myself throw, and my older brother [Rick] always
got mad at me for throwing that way, but that's the only way I know
how to do it," said Eckstein, whose 14 errors were sixth-fewest among
AL shortstops. "I take my crow hop, jump, run across the field and
throw it. It's not normal, but I find a way to get it done."</TE>
<TE>   So has the other half of the Angel double-play combination, though
not without some growing pains. Kennedy played shortstop in high
school, college and in the St. Louis farm system before being traded
to the Angels with pitcher Kent Bottenfield for center fielder Jim
Edmonds on March 23, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels moved Kennedy to second base, and the initial
transition was about as smooth as a grounder in a rock-filled
sandlot.</TE>
<TE>   "The ball came at me from a totally different angle than I was
used to my whole life, and I wasn't used to the runners bearing down
on me on double plays," Kennedy said. "But I started to iron all
those things out this year with the help of Alfredo."</TE>
<TE>   Almost every day during spring training, for 20 minutes after the
regular workouts, Griffin took Kennedy and Eckstein to the lower
fields at the Angels' Tempe Diablo Stadium complex to work on
double-play pivots and feeds. Kennedy, who made 11 errors this
season, grew more comfortable and confident than he was in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "His general around-the-bag awareness needed work, from tagging
runners out to turning double plays to his footwork," bench coach Joe
Maddon said. "He and Alfredo worked so hard in spring training, to
the point where he's now one of the better second basemen in the
league."</TE>
<TE>   Glaus is one of the better third basemen in the league, but he
played shortstop in high school and at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Moving Glaus, the third overall pick in the 1997 draft, to third
was a no-brainer--with his 6-foot-5, 245-pound frame, few thought
he'd have the range or quickness to play shortstop in the big
leagues, but his strong arm, soft hands and agility, honed during his
years at shortstop, have served him well at third base.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus still has a knack for making sensational plays while
botching an occasional routine play, but he has lowered his error
total from 33 in 2000 to 19 in 2001 and 20 this season.</TE>
<TE>   Those figures, as well as the error totals for Kennedy and
Eckstein, might have been higher if not for Spiezio, who has evolved
from a utility player to a Gold Glove-caliber first baseman.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio, who played third base in the minor leagues, was so
desperate to become a big league regular that when Oakland Manager
Art Howe asked him in 1999 if he had ever played second base, Spiezio
said, "Oh, yeah," even though he hadn't played a lick of second.</TE>
<TE>   But the Spiezio-to-second experiment didn't work for the A's, who
allowed Spiezio to leave as a free agent after 1999, or the Angels,
who traded for Kennedy when it was apparent Spiezio couldn't play
second in the spring of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   First base, though, was a different story. Spiezio replaced the
injured Mo Vaughn at first for most of 2001, showing occasional
flashes of brilliance, and his three errors this season were the
fewest among AL first basemen. "He's definitely the reason this has
worked, he's the catalyst," Kennedy said. "You don't have to worry
about throwing a strike, just field it and get it to an area where he
can catch it."</TE>
<TE>   The infield might not win any Gold Glove awards or dominate the TV
highlights, but it's more than adequate in the field.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about making the extraordinary play, it's about make the
boring play," Maddon said. "To be a very good defense, you have to
make the boring play, and our guys are very boring on defense."</TE>

<HD>Old Money in Good Spot</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Old Money made her U.S. debut on Jan. 16, she picked up right
where she had left off in her native Australia.</LD>
<LD>   The 5-year-old mare got a good trip in the allowance race and went
on to win by 1 1/2 lengths as part of an entry that was the 6-5
favorite. It was her fourth consecutive victory.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, Old Money, fed a steady diet of graded stakes, is
winless in five starts. After running in a Grade III, three Grade II
races and a Grade I, the daughter of Old Spice is dropped into a
softer spot today.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Robert and Janice McNair's Stonerside Stable and trained
by Ron McAnally, Old Money is an 8-5 favorite in the third, which
kicks off a pick six with a carryover of $88,143.</TE>
<TE>   While Old Money may be the one to beat in the mile turf race,
Netherland is the one to catch. Owned by Alan Gilbert and Mike Pegram
and trained by Bob Baffert, the 4-year-old Roy filly won the last
time she was able to get a clear lead and she will be in front today.</TE>
<TE>   The field is completed by the Bobby Frankel-trained duo of
L'Emeraude and Honestly Darling, Live Your Dreams and Kabylia.</TE>
<TE>   Like Old Money, Honestly Darling, Kabylia and Live Your Dreams are
all winners over the Santa Anita turf course.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The sixth, the second leg of the pick four, is a
wide-open sprint (six furlongs) for $20,000 3-year-olds that drew a
field of 11. Sunday In Moscow, who finished third against $32,000
claimers a week ago, is the 3-1 favorite on Jeff Tufts' morning line.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Bill Morey. The trainer won with 12 of his first 36
starters at Bay Meadows. Morey's only starter today is Winning
Stripes in the sixth, a one-mile race for 2-year-old maidens.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Donnie Meche. The jockey won with only two of his first
42 mounts at Keeneland.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Netherland in the
third, using Blushing Ciel, Lake Ray and Kissin Paster in the fourth
and using Amanda Louise, Iza Beauty and Passionforanna in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/28. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $12.40/$167.60. Total money bet: $206.</TE>

<HD>Benching Is Another First for Chistov</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mighty Duck rookie forward Stanislav Chistov, who put his name into
the NHL record book a week ago, took a seat Wednesday against the
Kings as a healthy scratch.</LD>
<LD>   Chistov has a goal and four points in the season opener against
St. Louis last Thursday, the most points in an NHL debut since 1977.</LD>
<LD>   But Coach Mike Babcock has become concerned about Chistov's play.</LD>
<TE>   "He has to realize there is a system," Babcock said.</TE>
<TE>   Chistov, 19, played only 10 games for Avangard Omsk in a Russian
league last season.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Bylsma, a healthy scratch against Detroit on Sunday, returned
to the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' game against Colorado on Sunday has been moved to 1
p.m. to avoid a conflict with Game 2 of the World Series, which will
be at Edison Field at 5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have made buyout offers to Denny Lambert and German
Titov, General Manager Bryan Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Joffrey Lupul, the Ducks' top draft pick in June, had five points
in his first game for Medicine Hat, his junior team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Playing smart and not taking unnecessary fighting penalties are
important goals for Coach Andy Murray, who believes the Kings
struggled in those areas last season.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a time to fight and there is a time not to fight, and
it's not a good time to do so when you're leading," Murray said.
"When you have momentum on your side, there's no need to fight."</TE>
<TE>   Before Wednesday's game against the Ducks, the Kings had only one
fighting major, but that changed less than 10 seconds into the first
period when Adam Deadmarsh squared off with rookie defenseman Kurt
Sauer.</TE>
<TE>   "I never tell the guys not to fight but I do tell them to use
their heads," Murray said. "That's one area where Lappy [Ian
Laperriere] has improved so much."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings will play just four of their next 18 games at Staples
Center. In the competitive Western Conference, Murray understands
that he'll need all his players sound.</TE>
<TE>   That's one reason why winger Ziggy Palffy did not play Wednesday
against the Ducks because the Kings want to rest his nagging groin
injury. "You just want to focus on the next game," Murray said. "If
you try to look down the road in this league, you will get run over."</TE>
<TE>   Jaroslav Bednar skated in Palffy's spot on the No. 1 line.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings were in a panic.</LD>
<LD>   Less than 48 hours before their game against the Detroit Red Wings
on Saturday night at Staples Center, Mattias Norstrom was stuck on
the docks in San Pedro, trapped in a shipping container.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Allison had been flown in from China to save the day.</LD>
<TE>   "It was pretty stressful," said Kurt Schwartzkopf, the club's
director of sales and marketing.</TE>
<TE>   But President Bush's lifting of a 10-day labor lockout at West
Coast ports freed some 20,000 three-inch-tall plastic Norstrom action
figures from their oceanfront prison and Saturday's heavily promoted
giveaway went off as planned.</TE>
<TE>   The Allison figures, which arrived safely by airmail, were put
into storage. They'll be handed out Jan. 4, when the Kings play the
Dallas Stars.</TE>
<TE>   Before then, the Kings will distribute figures depicting Ian
Laperriere on Nov. 2, Adam Deadmarsh on Nov. 30 and Ziggy Palffy on
Dec. 19.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are the first sports team to contract with Stevenson
Entertainment Group, a Sherman Oaks company whose other "Smiti"
action figures have depicted rock groups Metallica, No Doubt, Limp
Bizkit and KISS, plus MTV's first family of absurdity, the Osbournes.</TE>
<TE>   The company also is producing a set of eight NHL All-Stars that
includes Allison, Mario Lemieux of the Pittsburgh Penguins, Peter
Forsberg of the Colorado Avalanche and Brett Hull of the Detroit Red
Wings. Company founder Hugo Stevenson said about 30 other NHL, NBA,
NFL and minor and Major League Baseball teams have inquired about his
products, which he hopes will become the next bobblehead.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartzkopf, looking to attract fans, struck a deal with
Stevenson after reading about the collectibles in Rolling Stone
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings advertised the giveaway on radio and television, as well
as on 1 million pocket schedules, but they ran into a glitch last
month, when the Pacific Maritime Assn. imposed a lockout of the
International Longshore and Warehouse Union.</TE>
<TE>   The Norstrom figures had been shipped from China, where the
"Smitis" are manufactured. They had cleared customs but were stuck on
the dock.</TE>
<TE>   Frantic, Schwartzkopf arranged for the Allison figures to be flown
in, a costlier option than shipping. Stevenson picked up the cost,
"probably more than $20,000," Schwartzkopf said. The cardboard boxes
made to hold the sets were reprinted, flip-flopping the dates of the
Allison and Norstrom giveaways, and a crew of 20 was hired to insert
the Allison figures -- and accompanying sticks -- into the boxes.</TE>
<TE>   "The fans expect to get the stuff you're promoting," Schwartzkopf
said. "Giving them a voucher probably wouldn't have gone over very
well."</TE>
<TE>   But Schwartzkopf's scrambling, it turned out, was for naught.</TE>
<TE>   Early Friday morning, he got a call from UPS telling him that the
Norstrom figures were off the docks and ready for delivery.</TE>
<TE>   They were handed out, in the original boxes, on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   King fans were none the wiser.</TE>

<HD>Kings Continue Mastery of Ducks</HD>
<DH>Top line produces two goals in 4-2 victory, extending
L.A.'s unbeaten streak over rival to seven games.</DH>

<LD>The more things change, the more they remained the same Wednesday
night.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings dropped by the Arrowhead Pond and went home with two
points, after a 4-2 victory over the Mighty Ducks. Goalie Jamie Storr
continued to stymie the Ducks, flip-flopping to make saves. Jason
Allison scored the game-winning goal 6 minutes 26 seconds into the
third period.</LD>
<LD>   And the Ducks played the straight-man role before an announced
crowd of 11,332, the smallest to ever see a King-Duck game at the
Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<TE>   The majority went home happy from what seemed like a Staple Center
annex, having seen the Kings run their unbeaten streak against the
Ducks to seven games (5-0-2).</TE>
<TE>   About the only thing that deviated from that tried and true script
was the Kings' Bryan Smolinski scoring a goal while the opposing
goalie was on the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "There are 79 games to go and we're not going to feel comfortable
as a team until March or April, when our playoff position is secure,"
King Coach Andy Murray said. "I'm not going to let anyone get
comfortable until then."</TE>
<TE>   At 3-0, though, the Kings seem to be on track. They certainly
don't have to feel as troubled as their opponent.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks spent the summer wheeling and dealing, trying to juice
up the second-worst offense in the NHL. The Kings, meanwhile, more or
less stood pat.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, none of it seemed to matter Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "They just outworked us for 60 minutes," Duck captain Paul Kariya
said.</TE>
<TE>   Storr extended his unbeaten streak against the Ducks to four games
(3-0-1). Smolinski scored his first regular-season goal with a goalie
in the crease since Jan. 5. The Kings' top line, minus Ziggy Palffy,
produced one goal each by Adam Deadmarsh and Allison.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a pretty talented team here," said Storr, who stopped 31
of 33 shots. "We have four lines and six defensemen who all do their
job. We were without Ziggy tonight and scored four goals. What does
that say?"</TE>
<TE>   For starters, it demonstrated how often the Ducks left goalie
Jean-Sebastien Giguere dangling.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks had just tied the score, 2-2, five minutes into the
third period. Their euphoria lasted less than two minutes. The Kings
caught the Ducks on a line change. Jaroslav Modry found a wide-open
Allison charging down the slot. Allison, uncontested, lined up a shot
and Giguere never stood a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "We expected our players to go hard every night," Murray said.
"That's the only thing we are concerned about."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' list of concerns could fill a notebook. They were
scoreless in seven power plays, making them one for their last 15.
Their defense left Giguere to fend for himself. And their situation
worsened slightly.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks spent freely on such free agents as Adam Oates and
Fredrik Olausson. Yet their best offensive work came from their
fourth line. Defenseman Keith Carney fired a shot that Dan Bylsma,
locked in a battle with defenseman Mathieu Schneider, deflected past
Storr.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks knew going in that they needed to play sharp the first
month of the season or risk another early playoff elimination, and
the situation already appears critical.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question that we need some points," center Matt
Cullen said. "These are teams we need to beat, teams that we have to
compete against for a playoff spot. I know it's early, but these next
few games are very important for us."</TE>
<TE>   Giguere played with that urgency. He was brilliant at times,
stopping three breakaways, two by Smolinski and one by Deadmarsh. He
also saved a handful of uncontested shots.</TE>
<TE>   Deadmarsh, alone, scored on a wrist shot from an angle to give the
Kings a 2-1 lead four minutes into the third period.</TE>
<TE>   "You create your own luck," Giguere said. "Sometimes, when you're
unlucky, you're not working hard enough.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're in a zone, you just seem to get the bounces.
Everything is right. If you're not, every bounce seems to go against
you."</TE>

<KH>LAKER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Buss Released From Hospital</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Feeling better and fairly mortified that a night out Tuesday would
become such a spectacle, Jerry Buss returned to the business of
running the Lakers on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Buss, who apparently suffered a pinched nerve in his neck while
attending the Carousel of Hope Ball at the Beverly Hilton, was
released from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center early Wednesday morning
after undergoing several tests, team officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Buss, 69, rested at home Wednesday after fielding telephone calls
from friends and relatives for most of the night, according to Jeanie
Buss, his daughter and the Lakers' vice president of business
operations.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, Jerry Buss told her he was feeling well enough to attend
the Ball's post-party on Wednesday night and an exhibition game
between the Lakers and the Golden State Warriors tonight in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "He's doing great and he sounds great," Jeanie Buss said. "He
can't believe everybody made a big deal of it."</TE>
<TE>   According to his daughter, Buss was enjoying his evening at one of
the biggest social events of the year when he turned his head too
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "The pain made him light-headed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Buss was treated by paramedics at the scene and then was taken to
the hospital, where he spent two hours.</TE>
<TE>   He did not lose consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see why everyone was concerned and I know he appreciates
that," Jeanie Buss said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Having jogged when he probably should have walked, or at least
waited for permission to extend his rehabilitation plan, Shaquille
O'Neal trudged off to his examination with Dr. Robert Mohr on
Wednesday with some trepidation.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of wasn't supposed to run on it, but it felt good," O'Neal
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll get yelled at by Dr. Mohr. I've already been yelled at by
[trainer] Gary Vitti."</TE>
<TE>   After examining O'Neal, Mohr told the Lakers that the soreness in
O'Neal's toe was normal and that his recuperation could proceed as
planned.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not concerned," Coach Phil Jackson said. "This problem is
something he'll have to attach himself to for a couple of weeks and
then it'll pass.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we don't expect to see him on the court in the
exhibition season. But it's not that far away before Shaq will be
playing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers practiced in front of 550 El Segundo grade school
children on Wednesday morning as part of the NBA's Read to Achieve
program.... The Lakers play the Warriors at the Arrowhead Pond
tonight at 7:30.</TE>

<KH>THE WORLD SERIES ANGELS VS. SAN FRANCISCO</KH>
<HD>City of Brotherly Gloves</HD>
<DH>With Bengie and Jose Molina, who learned to love and
respect the game from their father in Puerto Rico, Angels are
relatively well set at the catching position.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster and Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angel catcher Bengie Molina picked up a bat and inched his hands up
the handle until he looked like some little kid gripping a log. He
struck an odd, somewhat comical, batting stance, one he has seen
through the years, in photographs and in person.</LD>
<LD>   "This is how my father held the bat," Molina said, as he lifted
his right leg. "Then he would step like this and swing through the
ball."</LD>
<LD>   Benjamin Molina handed his love of baseball down to Bengie and
Jose Molina, also a catcher with the Angels. Bengie, the proud son,
talks about him like a kid whose dad can beat up yours.</LD>
<TE>   "My dad was short, but he could hit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Benjamin Molina, the all-time hit leader in the Puerto Rican
amateur league, still works making tools in a factory in Arecibo. The
roots to the Molina family tree never got off the island. His sons,
however, have branched out, all the way into the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   When the Angels face the San Francisco Giants on Saturday, in Game
1 of the World Series, Bengie Molina, 28, will be the Angels'
starting catcher. Jose Molina, 27, will be in the dugout, backing up
his brother. And Yadier Molina, 20, a minor league catcher for the
St. Louis Cardinals, will be in the stands at Edison Field, cheering
on his brothers.</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels worked out Tuesday, Yadier Molina watched from the
dugout, dressed in an Angel cap and an Angel sweatshirt.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my team right now," Yadier said.</TE>
<TE>   Three sons, three catchers, two with one major league team. They
sprouted from a childhood overshadowed by poverty, where some days
one meal had to do. What they hungered for -- and what dominated
their lives -- was baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Their father preached the game and organized youth teams, though
none of the brothers played with each other on the same team until
Jose joined the Angels last season. Just as the father is proud of
his two sons playing in the World Series, the sons are proud of the
father.</TE>
<TE>   "It's because of all the hard work he did," Bengie said. "He
started work at 6, came home at 4 and took us to the field by 5 every
day -- Saturday and Sunday too."</TE>
<TE>   The brothers hope to honor their father in person, in Puerto Rico.
On Oct. 27, Benjamin Molina will be inducted into the Puerto Rican
amateur baseball hall of fame -- the same day reserved for Game 7 of
the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, we can win before then," Jose said. "I want to be
there with him for that special moment."</TE>
<TE>   Last season was the one for trivia. When Jose replaced Bengie when
he went on the disabled list, the transaction was believed to be the
first in American League history in which one brother replaced
another. In 1997, the Cincinnati Reds sent Bret Boone to the minor
leagues and recalled Aaron Boone to take his place. Later in the
season, the Molinas became the first siblings to catch for the same
major league team since Amos and Lave Cross -- of the 1887 Louisville
Colonels.</TE>
<TE>   This season is the one for keeps. When Jose joined the Angels for
the first time last year, he did so only because his brother was
injured. When Jose joined the Angels this year, he did so only
because his brother was injured.</TE>
<TE>   But when the Angels traded veteran Jorge Fabregas to the Milwaukee
Brewers in July in a five-player deal that brought outfielder Alex
Ochoa to Anaheim, the Angels had chosen the Molina brothers as their
two catchers.</TE>
<TE>   "Bengie is extremely supportive of Jose," Angel coach Joe Maddon
said. "I find that interesting and kind of neat at the same time.
Before the game and during the game, he's always with him, trying to
help him. Part of the reason Jose has done so well is because Bengie
is so supportive of him."</TE>
<TE>   The Angel coaches rave about Jose's defensive fundamentals and the
Angel pitchers enjoy working with him, so a brother act is entirely
possible next season. General Manager Bill Stoneman called Jose a
legitimate major league catcher and said the Angels had received "a
lot of calls" from other teams interested in trading for him this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're lucky to have him," Stoneman said.</TE>
<TE>   Jose spent eight seasons in the Chicago Cub system, getting only a
taste of big league experience as a September call-up in 1999. Now he
is gorging himself with the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Jose, who had played 10 major league games before last year, hit
.270 in 15 games for the Angels last season and threw out five of 16
runners attempting to steal. He hit .307 at triple-A Salt Lake this
season and .271 for the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "Jose has proven he's a major league catcher," Manager Mike
Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   That's what Bengie Molina proved two years ago, when he hit .281
with 14 home runs. He was the hardest batter to strike out in the
American League and threw out 33% of runners trying to steal.</TE>
<TE>   Bengie finished third in the AL rookie-of-the-year voting and was
rewarded with a four-year, $4.25-million contract last March. That
should have scared off any free-agent catchers, especially one who
was his brother. There was no future in signing with the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, this was Jose's choice after the Cubs released him after the
2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   "The Angels had a lot of interest in me right away," Molina said.
"I kept asking Bengie, 'You sure you want me to do this?' I didn't
want him to feel uncomfortable. I asked him three or four times. He
kept saying it was no problem."</TE>
<TE>   Said Maddon: "They are very, very close. It's almost like they
grew up together."</TE>
<TE>   There is a difference of opinion on who had it worse growing up.</TE>
<TE>   "He always had Mom on his side," Jose said. "I got the blame for
everything. I had an older brother and a younger brother. I got
blamed for things both of them did."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bengie: "He always got punished? It was the opposite. I think
Jose is just trying to make himself look better. When we were young,
I was the crazy guy. I cut school and went to the river one time. He
wouldn't go with me."</TE>
<TE>   What they do agree on is that baseball was first and foremost in
the family's two-bedroom home in Vega Alta. Bengie, Jose and Yadier
shared a room. There was little else besides the game.</TE>
<TE>   Benjamin Molina never left Puerto Rico despite being a talented
baseball player -- a second baseman, not a catcher. He was a .320
lifetime hitter for Vega Alta in Beisbol Doble A -- the Puerto Rican
Amateur League.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of the best players ever in the amateur league," said
Osvaldo Gill, the league's president. "He was a great line drive
hitter and a good leadoff man. The only thing that had kept him out
of the amateur baseball hall of fame is he had a temper. He had a few
incidents with umpires."</TE>
<TE>   Benjamin received offers to sign and play professional. He also
had a pregnant wife. The choice was easy. He took the factory job.</TE>
<TE>   "Times were really hard in Puerto Rico then," Jose said. "There
weren't a lot of jobs. My dad had to support his mom and dad and us."</TE>
<TE>   Benjamin was out of baseball, but baseball wasn't out of him. He
organized three teams -- one for each of his sons -- from neighbor
kids, so his sons would learn the game.</TE>
<TE>   On weekends, they would play games against other local teams.</TE>
<TE>   Life away from baseball wasn't a can of corn. There were days when
lunch also was breakfast and dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times, we were frustrated," Bengie said. "We see guys
with the $100 shoes, the clothes and everything. We had these shoes
that may cost $25 and that was our only pair.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my dad and mom did a great job by keeping us from
thinking about those things. They kept us in the park every day."</TE>
<TE>   Playing baseball paid off.</TE>
<TE>   Scouts looked at Jose first. He was a talented catcher playing in
the Puerto Rican amateur league in May 1992.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Bengie, who had just graduated from Arizona Western
Community College, who was signed first.</TE>
<TE>   "I was doing a tryout and this Angel scout was standing next to my
mother, watching," Jose said. "He asked if she had any other sons.
She had a newspaper and showed the guy a story on Bengie. He had got
five hits in a game the night before. The scout said, 'Bring him here
tomorrow.' "</TE>
<TE>   Bengie, who was an infielder and pitcher, warmed up in the
outfield the next day.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy said, 'I have a catcher's mitt in my car, let's try some
throws to second base,' " Bengie said.</TE>
<TE>   He signed the next day -- as a catcher. Jose was a 14th-round pick
by the Cubs that June.</TE>
<TE>   Both labored in the minors for six seasons. Bengie finally got
called up in August 1999. The Cubs called up Jose the next month.</TE>
<TE>   "I called my dad to tell him and he said, 'You got there, now show
them what you can do,' " Jose said.</TE>
<TE>   And now the Molina brothers have done just that. Even better,
their father, mother and two cousins were visiting from Puerto Rico
in July, when the Angels turned their catching duties over to the
brothers, so Benjamin could share the good news in person.</TE>
<TE>   "He is so proud of us," Bengie said. "Everywhere he goes,
everybody talks about us."</TE>

Although their team was swept in four games by the New York Yankees,
Pittsburgh's Paul and Lloyd Waner combined to outhit Babe Ruth and
Lou Gehrig, .367-.357
1934
Jerome "Dizzy" and Paul "Daffy" Dean each won two games, combining
for an earned-run average of 1.43, to lift St. Louis past Detroit in

1943
Despite the death of their father earlier in the day, Mort and Walker
Cooper formed the St. Louis battery in Game 2, with Mort pitching
one-run ball for eight innings in a 4-3 victory over the Yankees
1959
Although Norm Sherry, a backup catcher, didn't play, his brother
Larry starred, winning two games and saving two others as the Dodgers
won their first World Series in Los Angeles, in six games over the
Chicago White Sox
1964
Ken and Clete Boyer, starting third basemen for opposing teams,
became the first brothers to each hit home runs in a World Series
game. The home runs came in the seventh game, with St. Louis and Ken

<LD>New Orleans Hornet forward Jamal Mashburn was on crutches after
injuring his left knee Tuesday during an exhibition game against
Orlando.</LD>
<LD>   The team said Mashburn might have sprained his knee. He was
expected to have an MRI exam.</LD>
<LD>   The Hornets have battled injuries throughout the exhibition
season, with guard David Wesley being the only healthy starter. Guard
Baron Davis has been out because of back spasms since Monday; center
Elden Campbell has yet to practice because of a sprained left knee;
and forward P.J. Brown sprained his left ankle on Oct. 9 and hasn't
practiced since.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As expected, New York Knick power forward Antonio McDyess will sit
out the season after undergoing surgery in New York on his broken
kneecap.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Norman Scott, who performed the two-hour procedure, said the
injury would not end McDyess' career.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect him to have a full recovery and be 100% by the start of
next season," Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Bull center Tyson Chandler suffered a concussion after
colliding with rookie forward Lonnie Baxter during practice on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler was taken to the hospital and it was not clear how long
he would be sidelined. General Manager Jerry Krause said Chandler
would sit out at least Friday's exhibition game against the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler apparently dived for a loose ball along with Baxter and
fell face-first after he was accidentally kneed in the neck.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston guard Moochie Norris, the only Rocket to appear in every
game last season, underwent surgery to repair a dislocated finger and
will be sidelined about three weeks.... Cleveland Cavalier rookie
Dajuan Wagner is expected to be hospitalized until next week because
of a bladder infection.... Utah Jazz center Greg Ostertag is expected
to miss at least three exhibition games because of an abdominal
strain resulting from donating a kidney to his sister in the
off-season. A Jazz spokesman said the strain was not career
threatening and that trainers were being cautious.... The
$250-million arena being built for the Memphis Grizzlies will be
called FedExForum. The team will get $90 million over 20 years for
the naming rights, owner Michael Heisley said. The arena is scheduled
to open in 2004. Until then, the Grizzlies will play at the Pyramid
arena.</TE>

<LD>Todd Bodine was put on probation by NASCAR on Wednesday for careless
driving that triggered a multicar accident at Lowe's Motor Speedway.</LD>
<LD>   Bodine is on probation until Dec. 31. If there is another action
this season that NASCAR officials deem detrimental or disruptive to a
race, he will receive an indefinite suspension.</LD>
<LD>   "We've noticed numerous on-track incidents involving Todd, and we
felt this was the proper step to take at this time," Winston Cup
Director John Darby said.</LD>
<TE>   Bodine was criticized heavily for his role in the wreck in the
UAW-GM Quality 500 on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   He made a move to the inside of Ward Burton and Jeff Green, who
already were running side by side down the frontstretch, but Bodine's
left-side tires touched the infield grass and his car went out of
control.</TE>
<TE>   Bodine hit Burton, who hit Green, and soon about 10 more cars --
including all three from Richard Childress Racing -- were involved.</TE>
<TE>   "Todd does something stupid every week," Childress said after the
wreck.</TE>
<TE>   Also penalized Wednesday was Tommy Baldwin, fined $25,000 because
his Busch series car driven by Wally Dallenbach did not meet the
minimum height requirement after the Lowe's 300 on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Golf</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods said the best way to resolve the membership debate at
Augusta National is to hash it out in private.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no substitute for looking someone in the eye," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Woods said he would like to see a female member at Augusta, but
that private clubs have a right to set their own policies.</TE>
<TE>   "Hootie [Johnson] is right, and Martha [Burk]is right. That's the
problem," Woods said of the Augusta chairman and the head of the
National Council of Women's Organizations after a practice round for
the Disney World Golf Classic at Lake Buena Vista, Fla.</TE>

<HD>Gadsden Might Be Out for Year</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Miami receiver Oronde Gadsden might sit out the rest of the season
after spraining his left wrist in the Dolphins' 24-22 victory over
Denver on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Gadsden was listed as questionable for Sunday's game against
Buffalo.</LD>
<LD>   Miami's other starting receiver, Chris Chambers, has a concussion
and also was listed as questionable. As it is, the Dolphins will be
forced to turn to a backup at quarterback, where Ray Lucas will
replace Jay Fiedler, who has a broken thumb.</LD>
<TE>   Gadsden hurt his wrist in the first half at Denver but played the
rest of the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Trent Green sat out practice because of a sore left
ankle and Kansas City Coach Dick Vermeil said it was only "60-40"
that Green would play Sunday against Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Green hurt the ankle just before halftime of the Chiefs' 35-34
loss at San Diego on Sunday. Green managed to play in the second
half.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta quarterback Michael Vick was back at practice, saying his
right shoulder feels fine and that he plans to start against the
Carolina Panthers on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "No pain. No pain. It's good," Vick said after a two-hour
practice. "There's no doubt I should be able to start."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Dan Reeves was more guarded in his assessment, saying Vick
remains questionable.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago quarterback Jim Miller did not practice because of
tendinitis in his throwing shoulder and elbow, and is listed as
questionable for Sunday at Detroit. Miller said he expects to play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo running back Shawn Bryson will be sidelined indefinitely
after having surgery for torn cartilage in his left knee. Bryson was
injured in the Bills' 31-24 victory at Houston on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco put backup fullback Terry Jackson on injured reserve
because of a torn knee ligament suffered in Monday's game at Seattle.
Jackson will have surgery today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carolina offensive lineman Chris Terry did not attend practice,
and Coach John Fox initially had no idea of the right tackle's
whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   Fox said after practice that Terry's absence could be
"miscommunication, but we're still gathering information."</TE>
<TE>   Later, team spokesman Charlie Dayton said the team had been in
contact with Terry.</TE>
<TE>   "He was out of town on a legal matter and thought the team had
been informed," Dayton said.</TE>
<TE>   Terry has a court hearing scheduled for next week on charges of
assaulting his wife, Nyquell Jackson-Terry, during an altercation in
their home in July.</TE>
<TE>   He has denied hitting his wife, but a protective order keeps him
away from their home and the school and day-care centers their
children attend.</TE>
<TE>   According to court papers filed by his wife, Terry has been tested
for drugs more than a dozen times by the NFL in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Four men were arrested for running an illegal gambling site in a
motor home across the street from Raymond James Stadium, home of the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</TE>
<TE>   Fans were encouraged to open credit accounts with a Costa
Rica-based gambling Web site, and the men were soliciting wagers
ranging from $25 to $100,000 on Sunday, police said.</TE>

<HD>Rule Enforcement Is Suiting Lemieux Fine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So far, Mario Lemieux and the Pittsburgh Penguins are enjoying the
NHL's newly enforced crackdown on obstruction as much as any team in
the league.</LD>
<LD>   Lemieux set up three goals, Aleksey Morozov scored his fifth goal
in three games and the Penguins held on to win their third in a row,
beating the Atlanta Thrashers, 3-2, Wednesday night at Pittsburgh.</LD>
<LD>   Morozov left late in the first period and received 50 stitches to
close a cut in his left ear, but it didn't prevent the Penguins' new
top line of Morozov, Lemieux and Alexei Kovalev from piling on more
points.</LD>
<TE>   The line has scored 10 of the 14 goals by the Penguins and has
produced 25 points. Randy Robitaille also scored after replacing
Morozov against the Thrashers.</TE>
<TE>   The teams combined for 14 power plays, eight by Pittsburgh, as the
league's enforcement of obstruction rules again made special teams
play important.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to give the game back to the great players and
that's the way it should be," said Lemieux, who has 10 points in
three games. "You can make plays out there and it's making it
exciting for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta trailed, 3-0, then rallied with third-period goals by Ilya
Kovalchuk and Dany Heatley before falling to 0-11-0-2 against
Pittsburgh since joining the league.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the way we are supposed to start the game," Atlanta
Coach Curt Fraser said. "When we got out there, our eyes were as big
as saucers watching Lemieux do whatever he wanted out there. We
talked all day about it, prepared for it and when we got out there,
we didn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Boston 6, Vancouver 3 -- Glen Murray scored twice and assisted on
the go-ahead goal, and the Bruins rallied three times at Vancouver,
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   P.J. Axelsson, Marty McInnis and Joe Thornton also scored for the
Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   Harold Druken, Todd Bertuzzi and Daniel Sedin scored for the
Canucks, who wrapped up a three-game homestand with two losses in.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins took the lead for good when Sergei Samsonov scored with
2:08 left in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Samsonov, alone in the slot, one-timed Joe Thornton's pass from
behind the net past Dan Cloutier.</TE>

<LD>Troy Glaus can strike out a dozen times and he won't be the biggest
loser.</LD>
<LD>   Robb Nen can blow three saves and he won't be the biggest loser.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco Giants can be caught watering down the infield,
and the Angels can bring back cheerleaders, and Michael Eisner can be
asked the name of his starting first baseman with no lifelines, and
none of them will be the biggest losers.</LD>
<TE>   Everyone gathering in Anaheim this weekend can rest easy, the
pressure is off, this World Series already has a biggest loser.</TE>
<TE>   That would be the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Remember them?</TE>
<TE>   Nice little family, quaint old house, used to host the best
October parties.</TE>
<TE>   Back before your teenager was born.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the Dodgers peer out of their creaky front door to
discover the old neighborhood has suddenly, drastically changed.</TE>
<TE>   They hear music from one window. It is their hated neighbors to
the north. Those stupid Giants have slapped on some paint, fixed up
the yard, set up a bandstand.</TE>
<TE>   They hear laughter from another window. It is their ignored
neighbors to the south. Those stupid Angels have remodeled the
garage, added a porch, fired up the grill.</TE>
<TE>   After 14 years, a bona fide October party has returned to the
block.</TE>
<TE>   But much to the Dodgers' horror, that party is now raging on
either side of them.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball fans who used to fill their home now trample back and
forth across their front yard, occasionally pausing to peer through
their annual autumn cobwebs and wonder.</TE>
<TE>   Who lives there?</TE>
<TE>   Oh, yeah.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happened to them?</TE>
<TE>   For the record, the Dodgers won 92 games, their best record in a
decade. They finished 3 1/2 games behind the Giants for a wild-card
spot. They drew 3 million fans again, thanks to a renewed commitment
to the beloved Dodger brand of baseball.</TE>
<TE>   None of that compares to the nightmare of the next two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Asking the Dodgers whether they are rooting for the Giants or the
Angels is like asking a condemned man whether he wants the gas or the
chair.</TE>
<TE>   Asking them about lost sons Mike Scioscia and Dusty Baker is like
forcing their fingernails down a chalkboard.</TE>
<TE>   Asking them about Tom Goodwin is like poking them in the eye with
the chalk.</TE>
<TE>   And, to think, the Dodgers actually smiled earlier this postseason
when Gary Sheffield dissolved for the losing Atlanta Braves.</TE>
<TE>   Just before the World Series kicked them in the teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Publicly, as always, Chairman Bob Daly is very classy.</TE>
<TE>   "Any team that has tried for 42 years and finally makes the
playoffs, how can you not root for them?" Daly said of the Angels.
"Gene Autry was a wonderful owner. The people there now have
graciously given him credit. How can you root against something like
that?"</TE>
<TE>   Publicly, when it comes to the Giants, Daly is also appropriately
feisty.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a team that I spent my life not liking, not rooting for,
a team which even recently has tried to rub it in our noses," Daly
said. "So would I root for them? Let me ask you this. Would they root
for us?"</TE>
<TE>   Privately, none of it is so simple.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, the Dodgers realize this is not about a game, but a
culture, their culture.</TE>
<TE>   It was lost during the early days of Fox and the dark days of
Kevin Malone.</TE>
<TE>   It was carried north and south by disciples ranging from Ron
Perranoski to Ron Roenicke.</TE>
<TE>   Under the brightest of lights, in the most important of times,
this culture now has the Dodgers impossibly surrounded.</TE>
<TE>   Fans see the hated Giants and their mix of big stars and tough
role players and think, why can't the Dodgers be more like them?</TE>
<TE>   Fans see the Angels and their brand of hustling, thoughtful, Al
Campanis baseball, and they are too enraged to think.</TE>
<TE>   Daly has seemed intent on restoring the culture, bringing back
such figures as Dave Wallace, Maury Wills and Joey Amalfitano while
allowing Dan Evans to build an old-fashioned roster filled with
pitching and defense.</TE>
<TE>   But any joy their fans took in this year's achievements has since
turned deep green with jealousy.</TE>
<TE>   "People are upset because they think the Angels are a team that
used to be the Dodgers," said Sam Perlmutter, a local entertainment
lawyer and longtime season-ticket holder.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the Angels, you see Dodger Red," said Perlmutter,
speaking for many frustrated Dodger fans, and ain't it the truth.</TE>
<TE>   How about this truth?</TE>
<TE>   On that fateful June night in 1998, when Fred Claire's firing
marked the beginning of the end, check out this partial Dodger
roster:</TE>
<TE>   Bench coach: Mike Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   Double-A manager: Ron Roenicke.</TE>
<TE>   Single-A manager: Mickey Hatcher.</TE>
<TE>   Scouts: Gary Sutherland and John Van Orum.</TE>
<TE>   Today, all five men work for the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Is it any wonder that when Claire called Hatcher this fall to
congratulate him, Hatcher passed around the phone?</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, my advice to the Dodgers now would be to not be
distracted by anything that is now outside of their control," Claire
said. "They have to tip their caps to the Giants and Angels, then go
back to work."</TE>
<TE>   Easier for some than others.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Tracy, despite great strides in the last two seasons, must now
contend with comparisons to that beloved Dodger down the road.</TE>
<TE>   Said Perlmutter: "A lot of Dodger fans are probably thinking, the
Angels are cheap, can't the Dodgers just buy Scioscia and all his
coaches? Heck, just buy the whole team."</TE>
<TE>   Responded Daly, who arrived after Scioscia left: "While we
certainly respect Scioscia, there's not a man in baseball we would
take right now over Jim Tracy. He's the right manager for our team."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said he's cheering for good baseball like everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to put everything aside," he said. "I have nothing but
the greatest of respect for Mike Scioscia and his staff, as well as
Dusty and his staff."</TE>
<TE>   It must also be difficult for Evans, knowing they paid Tom Goodwin
$3.5 million to play for the Giants after the Dodgers cut him in
spring training.</TE>
<TE>   It was a good cut; Goodwin ignored instruction and was generally a
pain. But with $3.5 million, the Dodgers would rather have bought a
decent bench player instead of Goodwin's taunting grief.</TE>
<TE>   In all this, the Dodgers aren't so worried about losing fans to
the Angels. The hourlong drive will weed most of them out.</TE>
<TE>   It's the damage to perception that worries them. Now that folks
feel the Dodger Way has become the Angel Way, can they ever get it
back?</TE>
<TE>   To that end, last winter they hired the man who helped build and
nurture virtually every player on the Angel roster.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Bavasi now runs the Dodger farm system, and he might have
been their best off-season acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   But imagine that.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers doing something right by copying the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Their nightmare indeed.</TE>

<KH>WORLD SERIES * ANGELS VS. SAN FRANCISCO</KH>
<HD>Don't Count Him Out</HD>
<DH>Santiago, who overcame a near-fatal auto accident, relishes
the challenge when opponents walk Bonds to get to him</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- It is a moment seared in pitcher Andy Benes' mind.</LD>
<LD>   And it was almost seared on his forehead.</LD>
<LD>   The year was 1989. Benes was making his first major-league start
for the San Diego Padres. Facing the Atlanta Braves with Benito
Santiago as his catcher, Benes had just struck out Lonnie Smith when
the runner took off from first.</LD>
<TE>   "All of a sudden," said Benes, "I had to duck because the ball was
coming right at my forehead. Benito caught the ball, made his turn
and threw a BB to second base. It was almost like a line drive back
at me. The guy stealing was out.</TE>
<TE>   "So I go into the dugout and [Santiago] says, 'If you don't want
to get hit, you'd better get out of the way.'</TE>
<TE>   "I'll never forget that throw from his knees. That was not
something I had seen growing up in southern Indiana. That's for
sure."</TE>
<TE>   Benes had learned his first big-league lesson: Don't forget about
Benito Santiago.</TE>
<TE>   It is a lesson that has had to be learned by others as well over
and over again.</TE>
<TE>   Other teams learned it when they gave up on Santiago after the
catcher had a near-fatal auto accident in 1998 and was told by
doctors that he would never play again.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis Cardinal Manager Tony La Russa learned it in the
National League championship series against the San Francisco Giants
when he repeatedly walked Barry Bonds to pitch to Santiago.</TE>
<TE>   Santiago burned the Cardinals enough, particularly with the
deciding two-run homer in Game 4, to win the series
most-valuable-player award. He hit .300 in the NL championship series
with two home runs and six runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   And now it is Angel Manager Mike Scioscia who will be faced with
the same decision in the World Series. On the surface, it seems like
a no-brainer: Pitch to Bonds, who hit a record 73 home runs last
season and led the league with a .370 batting average this season, or
pitch to a 37-year-old catcher whose deeply-lined face makes him look
even older, a man who has changed teams eight times in 17 years,
usually the sign of a journey- man.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it," Santiago said of batting behind Bonds. "I like to
take that challenge. If they want to go after me, let's go."</TE>
<TE>   Few pitchers dared to go after Santiago in the early part of his
career. A native of Ponce, Puerto Rico, Santiago broke in with the
Padres. He was rookie of the year in 1987, hitting .300 with 18 home
runs and 79 RBIs. And he made national headlines with a 34-game
hitting streak.</TE>
<TE>   It was never quite that good again as he drifted to the Florida
Marlins, Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies and Toronto Blue
Jays.</TE>
<TE>   There were some highlights. Santiago hit 30 home runs with the
Phillies in 1996 and he always retained his catching skills, which
included the eye-catching ability to throw out runners from his knees
and communication skills to the mound that his pitchers loved.</TE>
<TE>   But Santiago loved the night life and his constant partying was
hindering his skills.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 4, 1998, the party was suddenly over. Santiago wrapped his
car around a tree in Ft. Lauderdale, leaving him with head trauma, a
fractured pelvis and ligament damage to his right knee.</TE>
<TE>   Play baseball?</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly wasn't thinking of it at that point," he said. "I was
just fighting to be alive. There was a lot of pain."</TE>
<TE>   It was 3 1/2 months before Santiago could even walk. But
amazingly, he made it back for 15 games with the Blue Jays in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Santiago went on to play for the Chicago Cubs in 1999 and
Cincinnati again in 2000. But Santiago admits he didn't feel like his
old self for several years.</TE>
<TE>   Then, while working out in Florida before the 2001 season,
Santiago got a call from Giant Manager Dusty Baker, who had heard
that Santiago had started to look like he had in his younger days.
Santiago soon signed with the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   "Forget all that stuff that happened in the past," Baker told him.
"This a new start. Give me all you got and you can be all you want to
be."</TE>
<TE>   After the accident, Santiago had left his fellow party animals.
Finally in San Francisco, his diligence and vigorous new work ethic
earned him a return to the heights of his past glory.</TE>
<TE>   "I was like a wild dog," said Santiago of his high-living days. "I
didn't have good, solid people around me. I was going in the wrong
direction.</TE>
<TE>   "God has given me another opportunity just to be alive. I'm a
different person now. I don't take anything for granted. I'm pleased
every day just to wake up.</TE>
<TE>   "And now, after 17 years of playing, to make it to the World
Series is like adding a good piece of cake."</TE>
<TE>   So come Saturday's World Series opener, if the Angels walk Bonds,
as inevitably they must, the rejuvenated Santiago will lick his lips,
savor his piece of cake and stride to the plate, hoping to again show
that he is not a man to be forgotten.</TE>

<LD>I like to go up to Frisco as much as the next guy, or is that a
woman?</LD>
<LD>   There's a certain charm to the Den of Iniquity with its slippery
slopes aiming everyone toward hell, which makes for a titillating
weekend escape from Orange County. But obviously it's no place for
anyone who treasures down-to-earth values, warm weather and parking
without a hassle.</LD>
<LD>   That's why we have Anaheim.</LD>
<TE>   "Anaheim had its start when 50 German colonists living in San
Francisco wanted to move to Southern California to grow grapes..."
wrote Elena Brunet on July 17, 1990 in her community profile for the
Times. "But planting grapes wasn't their only reason: They thought
San Francisco would be a bad influence on their families."</TE>
<TE>   Brunet added, "The Gold Rush of 1848 had brought saloons, miners
and brothels to San Francisco." Things have changed, of course, the
miners are gone.</TE>
<TE>   But I wonder now about the next week and what this Sodom &amp;
Tenderloin District exposure will do to the good people here in
Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   We're still waiting for David Eckstein to shave for the first
time, and I've just been handed a story from the Bay City News, which
says a Giant fan up there is offering to sell her pair of upper
reserve World Series tickets for healthy sperm, because a reputable
sperm bank charges $250-$350 for a vial, and the insemination process
requires two vials a month.</TE>
<TE>   It'd be sacrilegious to think of an Angel (fan) doing that, but I
fear we haven't heard the last of this kind of thing, especially from
a place that refers to its own Victorian homes lining Alamo Square
Park on Hayes Street as "Painted Ladies."</TE>
<TE>   "You can bet that the child will be raised a Giants' fan," wrote
the woman on the Internet message board at Craigslist.org after
presenting her unusual deal, and just what we need -- another brat
screaming, "Beat L.A."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW WHEN I heard the mayor of Anaheim was going to make a World
Series wager with the mayor of San Francisco on Wednesday morning, I
had this vision of Li'l Abner shaking hands with Don King.</TE>
<TE>   I'm already concerned we won't have enough tall buildings to climb
in Dogpatch to shower our heroes in ticker tape after they win the
World Series, and knowing Mayor Willie Brown's political reputation
for wheeling and dealing in San Francisco, I'm worried how he might
take advantage of our Podunk leader.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen, I think I more than held my own," said Abner, I mean, Tom
Daly, Anaheim's mayor for 10 years, and by all accounts a great
mayor, but leaving office next month because of term limits. "When
the Angels beat the Giants, San Francisco's mayor is going to have to
wear a Gene Autry style cowboy hat around City Hall."</TE>
<TE>   Wow, you really made it tough on him.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to get him to wear mouse ears if the Angels win, but he
wouldn't go for it," Daly said. "If for some reason the Giants win, I
have to wear a Willie Brown style fedora. Oh, and there's one other
component to this thing."</TE>
<TE>   OK, so after the Angels lose, are Anaheim residents supposed to
make out the checks for property taxes directly to Willie Brown?</TE>
<TE>   "If the Giants win, we'll treat a family from San Francisco to a
weekend at the Anaheim Resort," Daly said, "and if the Angels win, a
deserving family from Anaheim will have a weekend in San Francisco."</TE>
<TE>   Now if I understand this correctly, if the Giants win, a family
from Frisco will be heard to say: "We're going to Disneyland," while
Daly has arranged it so a deserving family from Anaheim can look into
the camera and say: "We're going to Carol Doda's Champagne and Lace
Boutique." I understand the value now of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure the family from Anaheim will go to San Francisco with
their eyes wide open," Daly said, which tells me he has already seen
Doda. "At any time they will have the option of turning back and
coming home."</TE>
<TE>   Depends who is driving the rental car: Mom or Dad.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A BASKETBALL agent tried to use "UCLA's basketball coach" for an
alibi on "NYPD Blue" Tuesday night after being accused of murdering
the pregnant girlfriend of a recruit. I waited for the credits to
roll, but I didn't see Peter Dalis' name as an advisor to the show.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AT A time when local folks are celebrating the fun of thunder
sticks, now comes word USC's Mike Garrett led a charge to ban the
noisemakers from all Pacific 10 stadiums next year.</TE>
<TE>   It's not the first time he has taken the joy out of USC football.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WORTH, a monthly financial/lifestyle magazine, announced the
Lakers' Jeanie Buss will be on the Oct. 21 cover in a "flatteringly,
low-cut evening gown."</TE>
<TE>   Inside, Buss reportedly is quoted as saying, "I know what people
want to hear. That I drive a red Corvette filled with pink flowers
and wear a belt that has a notch for every man I've slept with."</TE>
<TE>   I don't imagine we'll be seeing Jeanie wearing a belt any time
soon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN TERRELL Owens' financial advisor accepted the signed ball
from Owens the other night, he should have also gotten a pink slip.</TE>
<TE>   The advisor knew of Owens' stunt ahead of time, and while
tailor-made for Monday night TV fun, he cost his client millions by
not suggesting Owens hand the ball to a youngster instead.</TE>
<TE>   As long as the whole thing was staged, why not play everyone for a
fool?</TE>

<HD>Wales Stuns Italy in Qualifying Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three-time world champion Italy suffered a shocking defeat Wednesday
when it was beaten, 2-1, by Wales in a 2004 European Championship
qualifying game played in front of a sellout crowd of more than
70,000 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales.</LD>
<LD>   The surprise outcome, one of several curious results in Euro 2004
matches Wednesday, is certain to put Italy Coach Giovanni Trapattoni
under even more pressure.</LD>
<LD>   The Italian media had called for the 63-year-old coach's ouster
after a lackluster 1-1 tie with Yugoslavia in Naples on Saturday, but
Fabio Cannavaro, president of the Italian soccer federation,
subsequently said Trapattoni would remain in charge.</LD>
<TE>   That was before Italy, playing without the injured Francesco
Totti, Christian Vieri and Filippo Inzaghi, fell to a Welsh team that
got an early goal from Simon Davies and a late one from Craig
Bellamy, to offset Italy's lone goal from Alessandro Del Pierro.</TE>
<TE>   Wales has not qualified for a major championship since the 1958
World Cup, but is unbeaten in seven games under Coach Mark Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   England Stumbles</TE>
<TE>   England, expected to be a Euro 2004 power, also suffered a setback
when it was held to a 2-2 tie at home by lowly Macedonia in a game in
which goalkeeper David Seaman made yet another costly blunder.</TE>
<TE>   Seaman, whose failure to save a long-range free kick by Ronaldinho
of Brazil contributed to England being knocked out of the World Cup,
this time allowed an inswinging corner kick by Artim Sakiri to fly
into the net for the first goal.</TE>
<TE>   David Beckham tied it up for England, but Macedonia reclaimed the
lead when Vanco Trajanov latched onto a bad clearance by England
defender Sol Cambell and scored from 18 yards. A Steven Gerard goal
got England level, but it could do no more and the embarrassment was
complete when forward Alan Smith was red-carded in the closing
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Germany Disappoints</TE>
<TE>   Germany came into its game against the Faroe Islands in Hanover
expecting to score with ease.</TE>
<TE>   "The Faroes will concede six to eight goals," former German
national team striker and current Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz
Rummenigge predicted.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't happen. Germany struggled to a 2-1 victory that had the
crowd of 36,000 booing the World Cup runner-up.</TE>
<TE>   The Germans should have demolished the part-timers, especially
after a penalty kick by Michael Ballack gave them the lead in the
second minute. Instead, they squandered their opportunities, saw
defender Arne Friedrich accidentally head the ball into his own net
to tie the score and only prevailed thanks to a second-half headed
goal by Miroslav Klose.</TE>
<TE>   Seven minutes from the end, a shot by the Faroes' Hialgrim Elttoer
hit the post.</TE>
<TE>   Ireland Loses</TE>
<TE>   Ireland's players were booed off the field in Dublin after they
were beaten, 2-1, by Switzerland. The Irish are without a point in
qualifying play, having also lost to Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Goals by Hakan Yakin and Fabio Celestini were enough to give the
Swiss the victory, even though they conceded an own goal by Ludovic
Magnin.</TE>
<TE>   Ireland Coach Mick McCarthy is now likely to hear calls for his
resignation or for the restoration of banished midfielder Roy Keane
to help salvage Irish Euro 2004 hopes.</TE>
<TE>   Netherlands Soars</TE>
<TE>   The Netherlands, keen to put its failure to reach the World Cup
behind it, scored an impressive 3-0 victory over Austria in front of
46,300 fans in Vienna and moved to the top of its Euro 2004
qualifying group.</TE>
<TE>   All three Dutch goals came in the first half hour as Clarence
Seedorf, Philip Cocu and Roy Makaay scored.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere</TE>
<TE>   Defending European champion France, fresh off a 5-0 demolition of
Slovenia, swept to a 4-0 victory over Malta in Valetta, Malta....
Turkey, which finished third in the World Cup, went one better by
routing Liechtenstein, 5-0, in Istanbul. Coach Senol Gunes'
first-place team next faces a crucial match against England in
March.... Romania recorded the day's most lopsided result, helping
its goal differential immensely by trouncing host Luxembourg, 7-0.</TE>
<TE>   Zico Gets a Tie</TE>
<TE>   Japan, urged on by 55,437 at the National Stadium in Tokyo, tied
Jamaica, 1-1, in Brazilian former World Cup star Zico's first game as
coach. Shinji Ono put Japan ahead after seven minutes and the home
team led until Ricardo Fuller scored for the "Reggae Boyz" 10 minutes
from the end.</TE>
<TE>   In another friendly game, Euro 2004 host Portugal came from two
goals down to defeat Sweden, 3-2, in front of 30,047 in Gothenburg,
Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Spain and Paraguay played to a 0-0 tie in Logrono,
Spain.</TE>

<LD>There were a few surprises Wednesday when U.S. women's national team
Coach April Heinrichs named her 18-player roster for this month's
CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup, which also serves as the qualifying
tournament for the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup in China.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest surprise was the inclusion of Heather O'Reilly, a
17-year-old high school senior from East Brunswick, N.J., and one of
the stars on the U.S. team that won the inaugural FIFA Under-19
Women's World Championship in Canada this summer. For the most part,
though, the roster has a veteran look and includes five of the
players who were on the world championship-winning teams of 1991 and
1999 as well as the 1996 Olympic gold medal team: Brandi Chastain,
Joy Fawcett, Julie Foudy, Mia Hamm and Kristine Lilly.</LD>
<LD>   Also on the roster are Lorrie Fair, Angela Hucles, Shannon
MacMillan, Tiffeny Milbrett, Cindy Parlow, Siri Mullinix, Cat
Reddick, Tiffany Roberts, Briana Scurry, Danielle Slaton, Kate
Sobrero and Aly Wagner.</LD>
<TE>   The Oct. 27-Nov. 9 Gold Cup will be played in Pasadena, Fullerton,
Seattle and Victoria, Canada. The U.S. plays Mexico, Trinidad and
Tobago and Panama in the first round.</TE>

<HD>Steve Scott Elected to Hall of Fame</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Middle-distance running star Steve Scott, who ran the mile in less
than 4 minutes 136 times, has been elected to the National Track and
Field Hall of Fame, along with pole vaulter Earl Bell, 1992 200-meter
Olympic gold medalist Gwen Torrence and race walker Larry Young.</LD>
<LD>   The induction ceremony will be Dec. 6 in Kansas City, Mo., for the
hall of fame, which is under construction in New York is scheduled to
reopen next year.</LD>
<LD>   Scott, 46, won the U.S. men's 1,500-meter title six times and the
U.S. indoor mile four times. He was on three Olympic teams, finishing
10th in 1984 and fifth in 1988. He was on the Olympic team in 1980,
but the United States boycotted the Games in Moscow.</LD>
<TE>   He had the rare ability to blend his speed with consistency and
longevity. "It's hard to stay at that level for that long," Scott
said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "With injuries and illnesses, staleness, to remain in the top 10
in the world for 10 years, and consistently racing at a high level,
I'd like to be known as someone that was a tough competitor."</TE>
<TE>   Scott holds the national outdoor mile record, and U.S. indoor
records in the mile and 2,000 meters. As a senior at UC Irvine, he
won the NCAA 1,500-meter title in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Though Scott finished 10th in the 1984 Olympics in the 1,500
meters (won by Sebastian Coe), he received special mention in "The
Complete Book of the Summer Olympics" by David Wallechinsky, who
wrote: "For many years, 1,500-meter races in major championships had
been run as a kickers' race, three slow laps, followed by a final
sprint. Steve Scott had decided to turn the 1984 Olympics final into
'a true miler's race.' In the backstretch of the second lap, he tore
into the lead and forced the pace, testing the strength of the other
runners."</TE>
<TE>   Scott said it was a few years before he could watch that race on
tape. "It wasn't something I had practiced or even had confidence
in," he said. "It was a tactical error. My race plan had always been
to follow and move in the last 600. I wasn't real confident in that
race plan, but I felt like it was something we decided and, 'So, by
golly, I'm going to stick to it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Scott, the track and cross-country coach at Cal State San Marcos,
faced a severe medical challenge after he finished competing. He
overcame testicular cancer, requiring two surgeries in 1994 and wrote
a book in 1997.</TE>

<LD>Like a lot of teenagers, Jarrad Page had something he wanted to
achieve by his 18th birthday. But it wasn't landing his first job or
owning a car -- he already rejected those opportunities.</LD>
<LD>   Page's goal was to be in the playing rotation by the time UCLA
visited California in a game that is a homecoming for him.</LD>
<LD>   The freshman from San Leandro exceeded his expectations by
becoming a starter at strong safety three weeks ago and will spend
his birthday making tackles and covering California receivers.</LD>
<TE>   "My goal was to be playing," he said. "Actually starting didn't
seem real. All of a sudden, it's even better than I imagined."</TE>
<TE>   Many of his friends imagined him in a baseball uniform. Page
turned down a $700,000 signing bonus with the Milwaukee Brewers to
attend UCLA, and several people closest to him did not agree with the
decision.</TE>
<TE>   They will be in the stands cheering for him Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman walk-on quarterback Brian Callahan, the son of Oakland
Raider Coach Bill Callahan, is another Bruin headed home this
weekend, but he is not on the travel squad and must arrange his
transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan will watch the UCLA game from the sideline and stay for
the Raider game against the San Diego Chargers on Sunday. It will be
the first Raider game he has attended this year.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad and I talk every Sunday after his games and I went to
every home game last year, so I'm anxious to see [the Raiders] play,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill was offensive coordinator for four years under Jon Gruden
before becoming head coach this season and his son spent countless
hours in meetings with Rich Gannon and other Raider quarterbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I picked up a lot of little things," Callahan said.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-foot-11 Callahan was a backup at perennial power Concord De
La Salle High and was invited to walk on at UCLA after attending a
quarterback camp last summer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The two men Bruin cornerback Ricky Manning is accused of hitting
are scheduled to testify at a preliminary hearing Nov. 22 in L.A.
Superior Court. Manning has been charged with two counts of felony
assault stemming from a fight at a Westwood bar in April.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA is making a publicity push for Mike Seidman to win the Mackey
Award, given each year to the nation's top tight end.</TE>
<TE>   Seidman, a senior, has 21 catches for 365 yards and three
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Entering the season, Trent Smith of Oklahoma was considered the
leading candidate, but he has only 19 catches for 171 yards and one
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Nate Fikse, who leads the Pacific 10 Conference with a 44.1
punting average, is a candidate for the Ray Guy Award and Manning is
a candidate for the Thorpe Award.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bob Toledo said safety Ben Emanuel (neck) probably will play
Saturday but that running back Manuel White (hamstring) will not.</TE>

<HD>Trojans Settle on Ballhandler</HD>
<DH>McCullough is willing, able to make it a one-man show</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has been almost 35 years since former USC coach John McKay said
it, but his simple logic endures.</LD>
<LD>   Asked why tailback O.J. Simpson carried the ball so often for the
Trojans, McKay famously quipped: "Why not? It isn't very heavy."</LD>
<LD>   Sultan McCullough can attest to that.</LD>
<TE>   McCullough cradled the ball a career-high 39 times Saturday
against California, the most by a Trojan running back in 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   The senior from Pasadena, freed from the constraints of a rotation
with Justin Fargas and Malaefou MacKenzie, tied his career-best with
176 rushing yards in the Trojans' 30-28 victory over California.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll take it as many times as they want to give it to me,"
McCullough said earlier this week. "If you get the ball, you're going
to get your yards. You never get tired helping your team win."</TE>
<TE>   The victory over Cal was a breakout game of sorts for McCullough,
who gained more than 1,100 yards two years ago but missed most of
last season because of an abdominal injury that required surgery.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough was averaging a team-best 15 carries a game before the
Cal game. However, he never rushed more than 20 times in the previous
five games while alternating with Fargas, the senior transfer from
Michigan, and MacKenzie, a sixth-year senior.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Coach Pete Carroll and offensive coordinator Norm Chow
decided one back would bear the workload and balance the
pass-oriented offense. McCullough, averaging 4.5 yards a carry, got
the assignment.</TE>
<TE>   "We went on the fact that he'd run the ball the most and his
average was there," Carroll said. "We thought, 'Let's go on
something. Let's give him the shot.'</TE>
<TE>   "It probably helped the guys blocking up front. They got a feel
for how he was running and everything seemed to jell better than it
has at other times."</TE>
<TE>   McCullough rushed for 56 yards in 16 first-half carries and 120
yards in 23 carries in the second half. He ran the ball eight times
for 38 yards on the first possession of the third quarter and capped
the 68-yard, 12-play drive with a two-yard touchdown run that gave
the Trojans the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the quarter, McCullough took a handoff from quarterback
Carson Palmer, disappeared into a pile of linemen, then re-emerged in
the backfield and ran around left end for a 29-yard gain.</TE>
<TE>   "He dances in the backfield a little more than some other guys,"
center Norm Katnik said. "On some plays where the hole is open and
then closes pretty quickly, it might hurt him. But other times, he
can use his speed because something closed up and turn it into
something good."</TE>
<TE>   McCullough, who leads the No. 19 Trojans with 529 yards and five
touchdowns, will start again Saturday against No. 22 Washington in a
key Pacific 10 Conference game at the Coliseum. Washington Coach Rick
Neuheisel knows McCullough's capability. Last season, he gained 132
yards in a then-career-best 32 carries against the Huskies in a 27-24
defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a threat to go the distance--that's the problem," Neuheisel
said. "You can't let him squirm out because all of a sudden, he will
be gone."</TE>
<TE>   McCullough, the 1999 Pac-10 conference 100-meter champion, showed
his breakaway speed in the second game this season when he scored on
a 62-yard run against Colorado, the longest of his Trojan career.</TE>
<TE>   The play -- a run off left tackle, a cut toward the sideline and
sprint to the end zone -- mimicked the dozens of long runs McCullough
made during three seasons at Pasadena Muir High, where he gained
2,145 yards and scored 27 touchdowns as a senior in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough and Fargas, who starred at Sherman Oaks Notre Dame
High, both were recruited by former USC coach John Robinson. But when
Robinson was fired, Fargas headed to Michigan. McCullough signed with
the Trojans and new coach Paul Hackett.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough redshirted in 1998 and gained 410 yards as Chad
Morton's backup the following season.</TE>
<TE>   With new running backs coach Kennedy Pola challenging him daily,
McCullough wasted no time establishing himself as the starter in
2000. He rushed for 128 yards in the opener against Penn State and
finished the season with 1,163 yards, the most by a Trojan since
Mazio Royster ran for 1,168 in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   In Carroll's debut last year, McCullough rushed for 167 yards in
25 carries against San Jose State. Five weeks later, he had the big
game against Washington. But the following week, McCullough suffered
a strained abdominal muscle that ended his season and required
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't walk, eat or go to the bathroom by myself after the
surgery," he said. "I didn't know if I would be the same, if I would
even get back to playing."</TE>
<TE>   McCullough recovered in time for training camp in August but was
slowed by a hamstring strain. So was Fargas, who left Michigan in
December 2000 and was No. 1 on the depth chart coming out of spring
practice.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough and MacKenzie shared playing time through the first
three games and Fargas joined the rotation once Pac-10 play began
against Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   But after Palmer passed 50 times in a 30-27 overtime loss at
Washington State, Carroll and Chow got the Trojans back on track by
giving the ball to McCullough.</TE>
<TE>   If presented with the same opportunity on Saturday, McCullough
intends to take full advantage in the same way workhorse Trojan
tailbacks such as Simpson, Anthony Davis, Ricky Bell, Charles White
and Marcus Allen did in the past.</TE>
<TE>   After all, the ball isn't very heavy.</TE>
<TE>   "If you do it once, it doesn't mean anything," McCullough said.
"You have to do it again and again."</TE>

<TE>   Sultan McCullough's career-high 176 yards in a 30-28 victory
against California last Saturday -- which earned him Pacific 10
Conference offensive player of the week honors -- brought the USC
tailback's season total to 529 and moved him to eighth place on the
school's all-time rushing list. A look:</TE>

<HD>Polamalu Says He Is Ready to Play</HD>

<LD>A season-ending knee injury to tackle Shaun Cody was a blow to USC's
defense, but the Trojans are close to getting another starter back.</LD>
<LD>   Strong safety Troy Polamalu, who missed last week's game against
California because of a high right ankle sprain, dived for passes
during practice Wednesday and said he will play Saturday against
Washington at the Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think I'd be practicing if I wasn't going to play," he
said. "I'm ready to go. I'm doing everything I can."</LD>
<TE>   Coach Pete Carroll said he expects Polamalu to play but was unsure
if he would start. Sophomore Jason Leach started in place of Polamalu
against Cal and had an interception, his team-leading third of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   "He's finding a way to gimp around out there," Carroll said of
Polamalu, who was injured Oct. 5 against Washington State. "We need
to chill him down in the next couple of days, give him some time to
rest and get ready for the game. But he's ready to play. I don't know
how much, though."</TE>
<TE>   Though he was limping slightly, Polamalu ran hard during practice,
engaged in light contact and went to the ground in an attempt to bat
away a pass.</TE>
<TE>   "I went all out today, just like everybody else," he said.</TE>
<TE>   How much Polamalu can play Saturday will likely be a game-time
decision, Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Kareem Kelly sat out practice for the third
consecutive day and said he might not be able to play against
Washington because of a sprained right ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a 50-50 chance," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly watched practice without the protective boot he had worn the
two previous days. He plans to run today to test the ankle.</TE>
<TE>   If Kelly cannot play, freshman Mike Williams would get more
playing time alongside starting flanker Keary Colbert.</TE>
<TE>   "He can play more if he needed to," Carroll said of Williams. "We
just won't rotate as much."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before last week, Justin Fargas was splitting carries with Sultan
McCullough at tailback. But with McCullough rushing 39 times for 176
yards against Cal, Fargas had only one carry Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Though he's staying positive, Fargas said he realizes carries will
be difficult to come by with McCullough emerging as the Trojans'
go-to back.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a competitive person, it's hard," said Fargas, a senior who
anticipated having a big season after sitting out a year following
his transfer from Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   "But I understand it's for the best of the team. Sultan played a
great game. I just have to keep competing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No USC fullbacks touched the ball against Cal, and Carroll said
senior Chad Pierson remains questionable because of a sore Achilles'
heel.... This will be Washington's first game away from Husky Stadium
in 48 days, dating to the opener at Michigan on Aug. 31. The Huskies
have played five consecutive home games.</TE>

<LD>If you had walked into the MGM Grand Hotel or the Mirage in Las Vegas
last November and bet on the Angels to win the World Series, you
would have gotten 50-1 odds.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco Giants were at 10-1.</LD>
<LD>   The odds on the teams winning their respective pennants were 40-1
on the Angels back in January and 5 1/2-1 on the Giants.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels were slightly favored as of Wednesday to emerge
victorious in the 2002 World Series at 6 1/2-5.</TE>
<TE>   The odds are nearly the same for both teams in terms of the length
of the series. It's 8-1 on either club winning in a sweep, 5-1 on
either winning in five games, and 4-1 on either winning in six games.
The only difference is a seventh game. The Angels are 4-1 to win in
seven, the Giants 5-1.</TE>

<LD>Scott Spiezio keeps five gloves in his locker--one each for first
base, second base, third base and the outfield, plus a backup for
first base. He could need more than one glove in the World Series,
particularly with National League rules in force during the three
games in San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   Spiezio starts at first base, but Shawn Wooten, Benji Gil and Brad
Fullmer all can play there. Spiezio's versatility affords Manager
Mike Scioscia numerous options for double switches, or for using
pinch-runner Chone Figgins. For instance, Scioscia could use a runner
for Tim Salmon or third baseman Troy Glaus, because Spiezio could
shift to third base or the outfield.</LD>
<LD>   "I hope we've got a commanding lead and I don't have to do any of
that," Spiezio said.</LD>
<TE>   Many members of the World Series media contingent asked Spiezio
about Sandfrog, the garage band in which he plays during the winter.
Spiezio is grateful for the publicity but sheepishly notes that the
band has yet to record an album.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really have anything to sell," he said.</TE>
