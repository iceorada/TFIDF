<HD>Toyota restates hybrid goals</HD>
<DH>The company wants to have a standardized system ready by
2012.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those who've been wishing for more choices in hybrid
gasoline-electric vehicles have been buzzing about word from Japan
that Toyota Motor Corp. intends to have hybrid versions of all of its
vehicle types available by 2012.</LD>
<LD>   Wrong.</LD>
<LD>   Dave Hermance, chief engineer in the environmental engineering
section of Toyota Technical Center USA in Torrance, says what the
company wants is to have a standardized hybrid system ready by 2012
to use in whichever segments it decides to offer a hybrid car or
truck.</LD>
<TE>   Quite a difference.</TE>
<TE>   Hermance says language difficulties led to a misinterpreting of a
Toyota engineering official's remarks to a reporter overseas,
resulting in erroneous reports that the company was preparing to
offer hybrid versions of everything it sells.</TE>
<TE>   But there's still good news for hybrid fans.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota Motor Sales America is expected to announce several new
hybrids, possibly including a hybrid version of its small RAV-4 sport
utility vehicle, at the North American International Auto Show in
Detroit in January.</TE>
<TE>   Hermance says the firm's long-term plan is to make its hybrid
system the universal standard, with a Toyota subsidiary producing the
systems for sale to automakers across the globe.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan Motor Co. already has agreed to purchase Toyota hybrid
systems to add to a Nissan gasoline engine for a model to be sold in
2006.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota President Fujio Cho previously has said the company intends
to have more than 300,000 hybrids on the road worldwide by 2005.
Toyota, which now makes the Prius hybrid, has sold more than 100,000
of the five-passenger compact sedans since its introduction in Japan
in late 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Hybrids combine two types of engines, typically a small gasoline
or diesel internal combustion engine and an electric motor, to
provide the power of a larger convention internal combustion engine
with fewer emissions and more fuel economy.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota's system uses the electric motor to augment a gasoline
engine when additional power is needed for acceleration or
hill-climbing, for example. The gasoline engine shuts down when the
car stops, and the electric motor provides all the power at speeds up
to about 20 mph.</TE>
<TE>   A second type of system, used by Honda Motor Co. in its Insight
two-seater and its five-seat Civic Hybrid model, also augments the
gas engine with an electric motor but never runs in an all-electric
mode.</TE>
<TE>   Other automakers, including Ford Motor Co., DaimlerChrysler and
General Motors Corp., also are developing hybrids and plan to begin
offering models in the U.S. as early as 2004. Chrysler has shown one
concept that uses electric motors to drive the front wheels and a
gasoline engine to drive the rear wheels. Ford is developing an
integrated starter motor that allows the gas engine to shut down at
stops and immediately restart when the accelerator is depressed; the
starter motor also would assist the gas engine during initial
acceleration.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota's strategy is to spread the cost of hybrid development
across as broad a base of vehicles as possible and to work with
partners, including Nissan, to make hybrid power plants a universally
acceptable technology rather than the niche product they are seen as
today. Doing so also would tend to make Toyota's system the industry
standard.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota and GM have been collaborating for the last three years on
developing environmentally friendly automotive technologies, but
Hermance says the work is concentrating on fuel-cell development and
has not resulted in new hybrid technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Hydrogen fueling station opens near San Francisco</TE>
<TE>   The Sacramento-based California Fuel Cell Partnership has opened
its first satellite hydrogen fueling station to provide fuel in the
San Francisco area for hydrogen-powered fuel-cell electric vehicles
being tested by the partnership members, including Ford, Hyundai,
Toyota and DaimlerChrysler.</TE>
<TE>   The station uses electricity and plain water to make hydrogen and
was manufactured and installed at the AC Transit bus facility in
Richmond last month by Stuart Energy of Ontario, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Both AC Transit and Stuart Energy are members of the fuel-cell
partnership.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a key achievement for the partnership this year -- to be
able to extend the test-drive range of our fuel-cell vehicles beyond
the Sacramento area, and to learn about potential fueling
infrastructure technologies through real-world experience," said Don
Huberts, the partnership's chairman and chief executive of Shell
Hydrogen, a unit of Shell Oil Co.</TE>
<TE>   The hydrogen station, about 70 miles from Sacramento, is capable
of supplying the daily fueling needs of a small fleet of vehicles at
a fueling rate of one to two minutes per vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Additional satellite stations for fuel-cell vehicles are planned
by the partnership in the next few years throughout California. The
fuel-cell partnership expects to place about 60 fuel-cell passenger
cars and buses on the road by 2003.</TE>

<HD>This Porsche is still driven</HD>
<DH>The creator of the iconic 911 is back as a consultant for
the '03 Cayenne, and he has some strong words on the state of auto
design.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ferdinand Alexander Porsche, the man who designed the iconic Porsche
911 and then left the auto industry to begin an industrial design
house, is back -- as lead design consultant for the 2003 Porsche
Cayenne.</LD>
<LD>   But the dapper 66-year-old, namesake and grandson of Porsche AG
founder Ferdinand A. Porsche, is not back in the car business full
time. He says he prefers being able to use his skills on a variety of
projects -- a luxury that running his own firm, Porsche Design,
permits.</LD>
<LD>   Besides, he says in rapid German, he needs constant activity to
feel alive, "and you can't design a new car every day."</LD>
<TE>   In an exclusive interview with The Times during his first visit to
the U.S. in 20 years, Porsche said his aim as a designer always has
been to reduce objects to their essential function and then use
appropriate advanced materials to achieve a form that makes the
function come alive.</TE>
<TE>   With Mark, his youngest son, translating, he said he preferred
combining hand craftsmanship with high-technology materials.</TE>
<TE>   "In good design you have to combine different fields," he said,
holding out a hefty stainless steel pen from the Porsche Design
collection. "In this, the material [on the barrel] is very different.
It comes from high-pressure automotive hose that is very elastic. It
is by combining the different parts that we can create something
unique.... See, this automotive material compresses and creates the
same function [of exposing or hiding the pen's tip] in a more
habitable way."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that he chose an automotive component for the pen's body
isn't a coincidence. "I never am far from the auto industry," he said
with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   The headquarters of Porsche Design is in Austria's Salzburg
Mountains, in the town of Zell am See, where Porsche has worked for
30 years with an international team of designers and technicians on
projects ranging from motorcycles and hospital incubators to
televisions and computers.</TE>
<TE>   It was the launch of a laptop computer that brought Porsche to the
Porsche Design Boutique on Beverly Hills' posh Rodeo Drive late last
month.</TE>
<TE>   There, sitting at a polished mahogany table in an upstairs
conference room, he talked about the role of the designer in society,
defended the idea of a sport utility vehicle from a premier
performance sports car maker and said he didn't see much progressive
thinking in automotive design today.</TE>
<TE>   Question: You left Porsche's design studio in 1972 to start your
own industrial design firm. But your family still owns controlling
interest in Porsche, so you haven't walked away altogether. How much
do you keep involved with the car design side?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Practically every time I am in Stuttgart, I visit the
[Porsche AG] studio, and I offer suggestions when asked. But the car
I've been most involved in [since 1972] was the Cayenne.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why that? You are known as the father of the 911, a performance
car. How do you go from that to an SUV?</TE>
<TE>   A: Well, the 911 has many evolutionary changes, but all 911s are
in the same family. The Cayenne is a completely different car, so it
was more of a challenge. And they asked me to come back.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Most automotive marques have undergone massive changes in
styling over the decades. It would be difficult to look at a 1940
Cadillac and a 2002 Cadillac if their badges were stripped and tell
they are from the same line. But Porsches all have a distinct family
resemblance. Why?</TE>
<TE>   A: You have to keep the identity. If there are technical
developments, then you have to incorporate the shape to the new
technology, but a Porsche will always look like a Porsche. My
grandfather took these shapes from nature, so the headlamps of the
911 maybe look a little like the eyes of the frog, but it comes from
nature, and the best shapes are from nature, so why change?</TE>
<TE>   Q: We talk about design and we talk about engineering. Do the two
ever mesh, or are they always at war with one another?</TE>
<TE>   A: No. Designers need to be part engineer. Good design only exists
in concert with engineering. That is because form has to follow
function, so you focus on function and then give the object a shape
to make it appealing.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Your thoughts about the state of auto design: Are we seeing a
renaissance after the econo-boxes of the '70s and the jellybean
shapes of the late '80s?</TE>
<TE>   A: Automotive design today lacks individuality. It is all melting
together, and the different brands are copying each other. And also,
they are all trying to go back into their own history. When you look
at the BMW, how do you say, zed 8 [the Z-8 roadster], you see it is a
retro design. It is nice to go with your roots, but it seems that it
is a lack of creativity that forces them to do this. They go back
because they don't know where to go forward.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Ouch. Let's look at Porsche again. Some say design reflects our
emotional state and that the proliferation of SUVs, which are based
on old military vehicles, says we no longer are fancy-free but are
afraid and seeking vehicles that surround us in safety, like a tank.
Is that what the Cayenne is all about?</TE>
<TE>   A: Well, off-road cars are strong cars, but the trend to SUVs is
based more on the feeling of freedom [than fear], on the feeling that
our urban society is fed up with urban surroundings. People want the
feeling that we can go across country whenever we want.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is that what you were trying to say with the Cayenne?</TE>
<TE>   A: It was important to focus on the aspect that it is a real
off-road car, able to go where the Land Rover Defender could go, and
on the other hand is a luxury limousine you could take to the opera.
And, of course, it still is a Porsche.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The name doesn't seem to say much about function.</TE>
<TE>   A: The name was picked by the company, and I'm sure it is
interesting why it was picked, but I could never figure out why.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've been a designer for more than 40 years. You say that
auto design today seems to be going backward. Has it all been said
and done?</TE>
<TE>   A: Not at all. I was recently approached to redesign a grand
piano. That's interesting to me, because in earlier times we would
all agree that a piano was made of wood because of the resonance. But
now we have new materials and we have the possibility to redesign a
classic object to give it new shape. That is a challenge. There are
still a lot of possibilities to improve design.</TE>

<HD>Consumers shell out to boost cars' looks, performance</HD>
<DH>Automakers' troubles notwithstanding, so-called aftermarket
businesses seem to be thriving without big discounts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The economy has been soft all year, pummeled by plunging stock
values, politicians' war talk and consumers' fear of winding up at
the short end of the stick.</LD>
<LD>   The mainstream auto industry has camouflaged its problems by
forcing up sales volume with no-interest financing and delayed
payment plans that represent thousands of dollars' worth of
discounts.</LD>
<LD>   But an often overlooked part of the industry -- the thousands of
so-called aftermarket businesses, most of them small, that design,
make, sell and install automotive appearance and performance
equipment -- seems to be doing quite well without extraordinary
discounts.</LD>
<TE>   A report issued Tuesday in Las Vegas by the Specialty Equipment
Market Assn., trade group for the industry, says appearance and
performance equipment represented $25.9 billion in retail sales last
year, up 4% from 2000, and is expected to top $26 billion this year.</TE>
<TE>   "That's more money than was spent on video games and movies on
DVDs and VHS tapes," said SEMA spokeswoman Rosemarie Kitchin, citing
a recent economic survey of the video game and recorded movie
retailing industry by ACNielsen Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The automotive aftermarket industry's growth in 2001 far outpaced
the hike of barely 1% in the nation's overall economic output and was
fueled mainly by spending among the generally young enthusiasts in
the sport compact market, said Jim Spoonhower, market research
director for Diamond Bar-based SEMA. The group represents 4,600
companies worldwide, 29% of them in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's retail sales, Spoonhower said, were divided into three
broad groups:</TE>
<TE>   * Accessories such as upholstery, vinyl graphics, custom
instrument panels and steering wheels and some audio and
entertainment equipment, which accounted for $14.7 billion in retail
sales, up from $13.8 billion in 2000;</TE>
<TE>   * Suspension components and custom wheels and tires, which
accounted for $6.3 billion, up from $6.1 billion; and</TE>
<TE>   * Performance equipment, including specialized engine management
controllers, superchargers and high-performance ignitions, which
accounted for $4.91 billion and represented the only decline, down
from $4.98 billion in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The performance segment was off a bit, Spoonhower said, because
the engine control computers in many newer cars can override add-on
equipment, eliminating its performance-boosting benefits.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, he said the market for such equipment is shrinking
and will continue to shrink until aftermarket firms develop more
engine control chips that can override the factory tuning
specifications. Such chips exist only for a small fraction of the car
and truck models sold in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "But even with the decline in performance sales, our industry
continues growing," Spoonhower said.</TE>
<TE>   The sports compact market, which supplies performance parts and
appearance equipment for cars such as the Honda Accord, the Ford
Focus, the Dodge Neon and the Mitsubishi Lancer, racked up $1.5
billion in sales last year, a 25% increase over 2000, and is expected
to hit $2.25 billion this year, Spoonhower said.</TE>
<TE>   One example of the industry's growth is the ever-expanding SEMA
trade show taking place this week in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   The four-day show, which is not open to the public, occupies 2
million square feet at the Las Vegas Convention Center, up from 1.5
million square feet last year, and has almost 1,600 exhibitors, up
from just under 1,400 last year. More than 400 of this year's
exhibitors are at the show for the first time, Kitchin said.</TE>
<TE>   Major automakers have discovered SEMA and in the last five years
have become significant players at the annual trade event.</TE>
<TE>   This year, for example, Chrysler Group is the official vehicle
manufacturer, and there will be more than 125 customized Chrysler,
Dodge and Jeep vehicles scattered around the show floor, along with
scores of vehicles from other manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Hyundai and
Kia all are scheduled to make major product or marketing program
announcements at the show.</TE>

<LD>   I paid $450 to have it fixed. Since I have never had to replace
any tie-rod ends, I'm wondering if this might be considered premature
wear?</LD>
<LD>   In addition, my radiator has developed a small leak. Can I use a
stop-leak additive? And a camshaft seal appears to be leaking oil.
What about a stop-leak product here?</LD>
<TE>   -- H.S.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Your question is somewhat troubling, because it appears
that the first repair did not take care of the defect. If that's the
case, Audi should have paid for the second repair under the recall.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, tie-rod ends are not supposed to fail at the rate of
once every 20,000 miles -- such premature failures are one reason for
safety recalls. Safety recalls, unlike extended warranties or
goodwill campaigns, put responsibility on the manufacturer to fix the
problem anytime within the first 10 years of service.</TE>
<TE>   It is plausible -- but seems unlikely to me -- that some problem
other than the defect caused the failure the second time around.</TE>
<TE>   Audi representatives did not respond to calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The A4 safety recall was issued in October 1999, based on concerns
that defects in the tie-rod end could cause "diminished steering
control of the vehicle," according to the recall notice as reported
by automotive publisher Alldata.</TE>
<TE>   The recall warned that water and dust could enter a swiveling
bearing mechanism because a rubber seal had not sealed properly. Over
time, water and dirt could wear out the mechanism, causing loose
steering. The notice advised owners to contact the company and visit
their dealers for free service.</TE>
<TE>   Tie-rod ends are part of the linkage that carries movement from
the steering wheel to the tires, allowing the wheels to move up and
down and sideways, while the rest of the system remains connected to
the car's body.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the bearing mechanism undergoes a lot of movement and
wear. The rubber seals are important, because the part may be exposed
to dirt, gravel, grease, tar, ice, snow and water. But tie-rod ends
are quite resilient and often last the life of the car.</TE>
<TE>   I also am troubled by the $450 the dealer charged you. Again, the
repair probably should have been free under terms of the recall.
Beyond that, according to Alldata's rate calculation, the labor time
to change both joints on an inner tie-rod end would be about one
hour, which should have cost $60 to $80. The part cost about $135.</TE>
<TE>   You may want to call Audi at (800) 822-2834 or the company's
parent, Volkswagen, at (800) 822-8987, to complain. If you do not get
a satisfactory answer, call the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration hotline at (888) DASH-2-DOT.</TE>
<TE>   As for the leaks, a stop-leak additive is generally bad news if
you plan to keep a car for any length of time. These products work by
swelling the seals. This is fine for a while, but then the seals
eventually enlarge again and you have the same problem.</TE>
<TE>   In an engine, moreover, you'll be affecting every seal, so you
can't predict what kind of problems you will create down the road.</TE>
<TE>   Repairing a camshaft seal should take about two hours of labor and
cost about $5 for the part. Find a good independent mechanic or a
different dealer and you should get this done for about $100. If the
leak is minor and you aren't worried about staining your driveway,
just ignore it and watch your oil level.</TE>
<TE>   The radiator is more crucial, because you don't want to risk
overheating your engine. You could get it repaired, but typical
late-model radiators are plastic and not worth fixing. A new radiator
for a car with an automatic transmission will cost about $300, though
you can find an off brand for less on the aftermarket.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these off brands are of suspect quality, but then your
original Audi radiator lasted only 43,000 miles, so that's nothing
the manufacturer can boast about either. Labor will take about 3 1/2
hours.</TE>

<HD>The deep secret of caramel</HD>
<DH>A decade after an irresistible box from Brittany, a quest
begins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Emily Green</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OF all the caramels in all the world, Richard's mother had to bring
me some from Brittany. Richard is French, and a baker, who jokes that
his region is less famous for its bread than its platters of seafood,
so poetically called "fruits de mer." But as I tasted the caramel, I
realized that Richard's hometown had more to commend it than loaves
and fishes. It had this stuff. Brittany had caramel.</LD>
<LD>   I have always loved caramel. As a child, I used to stare longingly
at plastic-wrapped squares heaped by the checkout counter at our
local grocery store. My favorite candy bar is still a Snickers,
second favorite a Twix. I never bite into a chocolate from a mixed
gift box without checking the key on the lid to see which is caramel.</LD>
<LD>   But as much as I love all these, the tawny little chews in this
box from Richard's mother were different. They were madly intense,
super rich and slightly salty. I have never been so powerless in the
face of food. Even with one in my mouth, I found that I needed one in
my hand. Chewing and holding, I then found it altogether
disconcerting to leave the room where the candy box sat on the
mantle. Chewing, holding and standing near the mantle, I gave into
the compulsion and ate every candy in the box.</LD>
<TE>   That was almost 10 years ago. I did not allow myself near anything
like them until the last week, when I got to wondering: What is it
about caramel? All caramel, but especially that caramel? What is so
compelling about those swelling buttery flavors topped off by
toasty-brown notes?</TE>
<TE>   I had to know. There's nothing like a challenge, particularly when
it involves candy.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation begins</TE>
<TE>   My first step was ordering every kind of French caramel that I
could find on the Internet and in posh shops around town. Many came
in folksy wooden Camembert-style boxes, leading me to expect the
Brittany effect. I rolled up my sleeves and started sampling
sweeties. They were good, some better than others, but one after
another, I could put them down, leave the room, think caramel-free
thoughts. They were factory sweets. Nope. Nope, nope, nope.</TE>
<TE>   Second step was calling on the experts. Barry Swanson, a food
scientist, more specifically a fabulously informative candy doctor at
Washington State University in Pullman, began his primer with a
definition of caramelization. Anything with sugar in it can be
caramelized, he said. The browning of toast, the golden richness of
frying onions, all those wafting good smells that could waken Rip Van
Winkle, they are all products of caramelization.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is caramel, the candy. Unsurprisingly, back in 1912, it
was a Frenchman, Louis-Camille Maillard, who offered a scientific
explanation for caramelization, a process known among chemists as
"Maillard browning." By that time, French confectioners had long
mastered the art of cooking a combination of sugar and syrup to a
molten sugar state, browning it, creating a myriad of toasty, edgy,
even some almost bitter flavors, but stopping just before it burns.
They lined tart pans with this sugary glaze, made spun sugar cages,
generally worked wonders. Some smart candy maker thought to add sea
salt in order to, as Swanson put it, "broadcast" the flavors in our
mouths, an artful fillip behind caramel's lingering richness.</TE>
<TE>   The French also realized that to achieve caramel that makes our
mouths water, they needed to add fat and protein to that molten
sugar. The best choices of fat, Swanson said, are butter and cream,
"that's what gives you the flavor." Caramel, it turns out, is not
only quintessentially French, it is the sweetest expression of a
dairy culture that is so varied, it has a cheese for every day of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   As in France, American caramel making took off around dairies.
When I phoned Alan Cotich, president of the Classic Caramel Co. in
York, Pa., he was keen to emphasize that Milton Hershey started with
caramel in the heart of Pennsylvania dairy country before becoming
distracted by chocolate. Cotich's company supplies caramel for
big-time candy makers who reformulate it into their products. He sees
caramel as a notably honest confection. "No colors or flavors are
added to caramel," Cotich says. "All are developed by proper
application of heat and time."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, if you buy a candy that says it's got caramel
coloring in it, then either a mild caramel has been dyed to suggest a
smokier bite than the cooking actually achieved, or it ain't caramel.</TE>
<TE>   Like Hershey before him, his company grew up in Pennsylvania
because of the lush local dairy culture. But they don't always use
cream, Cotich said. Choice of fat is dictated by client. Caramel is
so versatile, it can be hard, medium chewy or soft. It goes into
suckers, sauce, candy or even as delivery systems for calcium
supplements, he said. In each case, there might be a different fat
involved: soy oil, coconut oil or refined palm kernel oil.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, at See's candies, there are two acceptable fats:
whipping cream or butter, usually a mixture of the two. The vice
president, Richard van Doren, says of his candies: "They are all
natural ingredients." I never doubted it. What's more, it's high time
that someone confirmed my long-held belief that See's Almond Royale
is, in fact, a health food.</TE>
<TE>   A swooning success</TE>
<TE>   But it's still not the sort of caramel that Richard's mother gave
me, something that properly should be a controlled substance. I
wondered if I hadn't somehow imagined their potency. I took to
cookbooks, and ran through any number of recipes. I could not find
one for salty Breton caramel.</TE>
<TE>   Then my editor remembered some indecently good caramels served in
the New York restaurant of French chef Alain Ducasse. To my
astonishment, the restaurant agreed to part with the recipe (merci!).</TE>
<TE>   I went out and got the best cream, the best butter and the best
sugar I could find. Cheap stuff would not, I was sure, achieve the
Brittany effect.</TE>
<TE>   For the next four days, I made Ducasse's caramels every night and
brought them to the office next day. I made them right, I made them
wrong. I overcooked them and undercooked them. I made them plain,
then with vanilla and maple syrup, then with Valhrona 100% cocoa
solids dark chocolate.</TE>
<TE>   I had not misremembered the intensity of fresh French-style
caramel. This was the butter, cream and sugar in perfect pitch. I
realized why they are so scarce. They are soft, luscious -- halfway
to a fresh food. Factory caramels never could taste like these:
Butter practically runs from them. The recipe didn't come with an
eat-by date, and we didn't give any a chance to age, but I'm sure
they should be made, served and eaten in fairly good order. They most
certainly would become rancid on a candy rack.</TE>
<TE>   Take the trouble to make these, serve them, and they induce
rapture. One afternoon, I passed out the caramels in the newsroom. Of
approximately 100 people offered them, only two declined. The most
typical reactions were a cry to the heavens, purrs, groans,
astonishment at the richness and waves of complex flavors.</TE>
<TE>   When one colleague registered the flavors, he practically shouted,
"Sweet Mary mother of God!"</TE>
<TE>   To those who have yet to try these, please don't take offense.
It's not sacrilege. That's the Brittany effect. That's caramel.</TE>

<TE>   Caramel sauce</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 25 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 6 (1 1/2 cups)</TE>
<TE>   Note: From "My Chateau Kitchen" by Anne Willan (Clarkson Potter,
2000).</TE>
<TE>   1 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup water</TE>
<TE>   Lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) salted butter</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1. Combine the sugar with the water and a squeeze of lemon juice
in a heavy saucepan. Stir to combine and cook over low heat until the
sugar dissolves, 3 to 4 minutes. (The lemon juice helps stop the
sugar from crystallizing.) Increase the heat to medium and boil the
syrup rapidly without stirring until it starts to turn golden around
the edges, about 10 minutes. Do not stir -- if you do, the syrup may
crystallize.</TE>
<TE>   2. Meanwhile, melt the butter with the cream in a separate
saucepan over medium heat.</TE>
<TE>   3. When the syrup begins to color, lower the heat a bit and
continue boiling to a deep golden color, about 3 to 4 minutes; it
will darken rapidly. Remove the pan from the heat and let it cool for
30 seconds. Add the butter mixture, standing back as the sauce will
sputter and bubble up in the pan. Put it back over the heat, stirring
until the caramel is completely dissolved. Let the sauce cool, then
taste it and add a dash of salt to sharpen the flavor. Serve hot or
chilled.</TE>

<TE>   Walnut caramel tart</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 2 hours</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 12</TE>
<TE>   Note: The tart filling is from "The American Baker" by Jim Dodge
with Elaine Ratner (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1987); the shell is from
"Baking With Jim Dodge" by the same authors (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1991).</TE>
<TE>   Tart shell</TE>
<TE>   1/2cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cold</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon coarse salt</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups flour</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   1. If using a mixer, cut the butter into 1-inch cubes. Blend with
the sugar, salt and flour at low speed until the mixture resembles
coarse meal. Add the cream and mix until the dough comes together.</TE>
<TE>   2. If mixing by hand, combine the sugar, salt and flour and chill
in the freezer, 30 minutes. Cut the butter into 1-inch cubes. Add to
the chilled ingredients and toss until coated with flour. Pinch the
flour and butter together until the butter is in thin flakes. Rub
small amounts of the mixture between your fingers until it resembles
coarse meal. Add the cream and turn it in with a rubber spatula,
turning the flour over repeatedly. When absorbed, press the dough
against the bottom of the bowl.</TE>
<TE>   3. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 13-inch
circle. Fold the dough into quarters and lift into an 11- or 12-inch
tart pan. Unfold and settle it into the pan. Gently press the dough
against the sides, being careful not to press against the bottom.
Trim off the extra dough. Chill until firm, about 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   4. Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Line the shell with heavy foil,
covering the edges and bottom. Poke holes with a fork over the
bottom, piercing both foil and dough. Bake until the inside of the
shell no longer looks raw, 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until
the shell is golden brown and has pulled away from the sides, 3 to 5
minutes more.</TE>
<TE>   Filling</TE>
<TE>   2 cups sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup water</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   3 cups walnut pieces</TE>
<TE>   2 eggs</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   2. Stir together the sugar and water in a 3-quart heavy-bottomed
saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook without stirring
until half the sugar has dissolved and the syrup is a light mahogany
color (350 degrees on a candy thermometer), about 30 minutes. Swirl
the pan during cooking if the syrup is not darkening evenly. Remove
from the heat and very carefully pour in the cream (the hot syrup may
splatter). When the bubbling stops, stir and set aside to cool at
least 15 minutes. (This is important because if the syrup is too hot
when you add it to the eggs, it will cook them and ruin your
filling.)</TE>
<TE>   3. Toast the walnuts on a baking sheet in the oven, 5 minutes.
Chop them into 1/2-inch pieces.</TE>
<TE>   4. Beat the eggs at medium-high speed, 1 minute. Mix in the
caramel. Stir in the walnut pieces. Spoon the mixture into the baked
tart shell with a slotted spoon. Pour any remaining caramel over the
top and smooth the surface with the back of the spoon. Bake 30 to 35
minutes. The filling will feel soft when it comes out of the oven but
will set as it cools.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Caramel ice cream</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour, plus 1 1/2 hours chilling</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 12 servings (1 1/2 quarts)</TE>
<TE>   Note: From "Desserts" by Nancy Silverton (Biscuit Books, 2000).
The caramelized sugar must be very dark to sufficiently color and
flavor this ice cream, but be careful not to burn it.</TE>
<TE>   8 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   2 cups whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   2 cups milk</TE>
<TE>   1 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 vanilla bean, split and scraped</TE>
<TE>   1. Whisk the egg yolks lightly to break them up in a large bowl.
Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   2. Scald the cream and milk in a large, heavy saucepan. Keep warm
over low heat.</TE>
<TE>   3. Heat the sugar and vanilla bean in a small heavy saucepan or an
unlined copper pan over medium heat until the sugar caramelizes, 5 to
8 minutes. Stir occasionally with a wooden spoon to ensure that the
sugar colors evenly. Once one portion of the sugar begins to darken,
toss it with the uncooked sugar. This will prevent the sugar from
burning in one spot before the entire mixture has liquefied and
turned a dark caramel color.</TE>
<TE>   4. When the mixture begins to smoke, set the bottom of the pan in
a bowl of water to stop it from cooking and coloring further. Remove
the vanilla bean. Immediately begin whisking the mixture into the
warm cream in 3 or 4 batches; pour in the cream quickly or it will
continue to cook and burn. (Careful -- it will splatter and bubble
up.) Reheat the cream mixture, stirring constantly, until the caramel
is completely incorporated.</TE>
<TE>   5. Pour about one-fourth of the hot cream mixture into the egg
yolks, whisking continuously. Return to the saucepan, and whisk
together with the remaining cream. Cook over low heat, being careful
not to boil, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the
mixture thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon, about 5
minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl. Whisk a few
times to release the heat. Chill about 1 hour.</TE>
<TE>   6. Freeze in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer's
instructions.</TE>

<TE>   Caramel with salted butter</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 30 minutes, plus 2 hours cooling</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 36 caramels</TE>
<TE>   Note: From Alain Ducasse at the Essex House Restaurant in New
York. Fleur de sel, a sea salt, is sold at specialty markets.</TE>
<TE>   1 cup half-and-half</TE>
<TE>   1 cup (2 sticks) salted butter</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel</TE>
<TE>   1 pound superfine sugar (about 2 3/4 cups)</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup corn syrup</TE>
<TE>   1. Bring the half-and-half, butter and fleur de sel to boil in a
heavy, 3-quart saucepan. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   2. Stir together the sugar and corn syrup in a heavy saucepan.
Bring to a temperature of 293 degrees on a candy thermometer over
medium heat. As the sugar begins to melt, swirl the pan often until
all the sugar is melted. Remove the pan from the heat and add the
half-and-half mixture. Set the pan over medium heat and bring the
mixture to 248 degrees, stirring frequently. This will take 10 to 15
minutes. (The mixture will look like a caramel sauce.)</TE>
<TE>   3. Pour into an 8-inch-square nonstick pan and allow to set 2
hours.</TE>
<TE>   4. After the caramel has completely cooled, set the pan over very
low heat just enough to loosen the caramel, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Invert the pan onto a nonstick surface. Cut the caramel into 36
pieces and wrap individually. Store in a dry place.</TE>
<TE>   Each caramel: 115 calories; 90 mg. sodium; 16 mg. cholesterol; 6
grams fat; 4 grams saturated fat; 16 grams carbohydrates; 0 protein;
0 fiber.</TE>

<HD>Splendid dives</HD>
<DH>Wade around town and you'll see why L.A. cherishes these
little joints.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>DOWN where the hangout, the hole in the wall and the greasy spoon run
together, there's a lovable mutt called the dive.</LD>
<LD>   If you go by the dictionary, a dive is a shabby or unsavory bar or
restaurant. To its regulars, though, it's a haven from the striving
world; a comfortable, friendly, unpretentious place with some special
charm or aura.</LD>
<LD>   A fashionable "scene" -- say, Swingers in Santa Monica -- can't be
a dive; fashion involves too much striving. And you can't become a
dive by trying. Look at Ed Debevic's and the House of Blues, which
yearn for divehood but will never, ever attain it. It's just a spirit
that develops between a place and its regulars. If a dive's owner
retires or has to sell it for some reason, it's amazing how often the
new owner is a customer who bought it just to keep the place going.</LD>
<TE>   People rarely think of dives when they think of L.A. They think of
fast food joints or California cuisine, maybe of exotic pizzerias or
Asian restaurants. But L.A. treasures its dives even more than most
cities do, because they've always been an endangered species here,
thanks to the rapid growth and ever-changing demographics that have
marked our town for, oh, 120 years or so.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, age alone is not enough to make you a dive -- some of
our oldest restaurants are much too exalted for that. Take Musso &amp;
Frank's (1919), the Pacific Dining Car (1921), Tam o' Shanter (1922),
El Cholo (1927) or Canter's Delicatessen (1931 ... well, hold on;
maybe Canter's is a dive at that).</TE>
<TE>   Some dives, at least in the view of ex-customers, soullessly
abandon their divehood. Duke's Coffee Shop was a true dive when it
was at the Tropicana Hotel, they say, but when it moved up to Sunset
Boulevard ... well, these days Duke's has valet parking. Say no more,
they say.</TE>
<TE>   Others lose their customers for one reason or other. Phil's Diner
(1928-1996), a spirited little joint in an imitation railway car next
to the North Hollywood train station, outlived the railroad but
couldn't survive the noise and dust when the new Red Line station was
being built. The ultra-tacky West L.A. joint Kelbo's, opened in 1947,
may have coasted on its Polynesian theme too long; by the early '90s,
people had stopped going. A quaint Sun Valley truck stop named Pink
Cafe got "discovered" by a Hollywood crowd in the '80s and eagerly
changed its name to Cadillac Jack's Cafe. These days it's just a
movie location you can rent when your script has a scene set in a
truck stop.</TE>
<TE>   The following tour is a personal selection. I'm not fool enough to
walk into an argument about the best dives in town. That would
require a lifetime of study, and anyway, the definitions are not hard
and fast. Where do you draw the line between a dive and a hangout, or
a greasy spoon? Plenty of dives serve nothing more elaborate than
sandwiches, but several steakhouses qualify. And don't think food is
a minor part of a dive's success. Surprisingly often, dives refuse to
give out their recipes.</TE>
<TE>   96 and still dipping</TE>
<TE>   Some places would resent being considered dives. Cole's PE Buffet
is certainly one. Opened in 1908, back when the Pacific Electric
Building was the terminus for the area's trolley lines, it originally
was a classy downtown restaurant. Its Tiffany lamps aren't replicas
installed during the '60s Art Nouveau craze, they're actual Tiffany
lamps.</TE>
<TE>   But when the trolleys stopped running, Cole's found itself in a
backwater, and over the years it has developed a somewhat brooding
spirit, particularly in the bar. The dining room has the weary,
gallant air of tradition gone a bit to seed (the rowdy New Year's Eve
party scene in "Forrest Gump" was shot here, probably to play off
this quality). The result is one of the most distinctive
personalities of any restaurant in town.</TE>
<TE>   Philippe's the Original, which opened the same year as Cole's a
dozen blocks to the north, has a more unpretentious style, but
Philippe's bustles a bit too much for a dive. The two have long
wrangled over who invented the French dip sandwich. Whichever was
first, Cole's makes a more careful version, the meat cut just so and
the bun dipped in very dark broth with a practiced hand, possibly
just because the counterman has a lot more leisure.</TE>
<TE>   "Eatz Cafe," reads a hopeful sign tempting newcomers to swerve off
busy Los Feliz Boulevard. It shares a parking lot with the nine-hole
municipal golf course that hugs the east bank of the Los Angeles
River.</TE>
<TE>   You'd figure Eatz as just a greasy spoon if all you had to go on
was its menu, an ancient list of short-order dishes enclosed in a
worn plastic cover. A few of the sandwiches are old standards that
have become rare in the last quarter century, such as fried egg,
meatloaf or liverwurst and Swiss on rye.</TE>
<TE>   But it's more than that. It has the attraction of distinctive '50s
dinette architecture, complete with Googie-style canted windows. The
building takes the form of a sturdy barrel vault enclosed in a more
conventional box structure. You can sit in this moderne style
geometry and gaze out on people putting around the tiny golf links
while you work on, say, a grilled cod on sourdough.</TE>
<TE>   Could you be more Silver Lake?</TE>
<TE>   There has been a restaurant at Millie's address since 1926, when
the Devil's Mess opened there. Over the years no Silver Lake dive has
had a more devoted following. This is one of the places that a
customer has bought to keep it from going out of business. The same
customer has bought it twice, in fact -- Paul Greenstein sold it in
1989 to a waitress and a few years later bought it back again.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago Millie's acquired a second room, so now it has, in
addition to sidewalk dining and a lunch counter, a tiny dining room
crowded with tables. But over the years nobody has ever feared
Millie's would go upscale; in one incarnation, its waitresses wore
pajamas. The walls are covered with aged tchotchkes, including a
Highway 66 sign (Sunset Boulevard was part of the legendary Route 66)
and a fly-blown Sixties-era Pepsi sign from Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Along with generous helpings of shaggy bohemian vibe, Millie's
serves breakfast (egg dishes and banana-walnut or berry pancakes) and
lunch (sandwiches, burritos and salads) all morning and afternoon.
The food is more carefully prepared than you might expect, or think
when you see it thrown on the plate, and the coffee particularly
good.</TE>
<TE>   Is Barney's Beanery still a dive, now that it has valet parking in
the evening? Just look at the crowds of people chugging suds, eating
chili and playing ferocious air hockey. Sure, it's still a dive.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, you just can't discuss L.A. dives without mentioning
this West Hollywood immortal, which started serving chili in a tiny
shack 75 years ago when the neighborhood was undeveloped countryside.
Movie studios opened up in the vicinity, and in the '30s Barney's
became a hangout for actors.</TE>
<TE>   A number of restaurants could make the same sort of claim, but
with this difference: Eventually either the actors stopped coming
there and the restaurant closed, or the same actors kept coming and
it became an old fogeys' hangout. Barney's, through some peculiar
alchemy, has continued to appeal largely to twentysomethings,
generation after generation: pop artists in the '60s, punk musicians
in the '80s and so on. Studying the bleached, corroded, tattered
stuff on the walls is like taking a walk through the history of pop
culture.</TE>
<TE>   Barney's current 12-page menu lists hundreds of items, from
calzone puttanesca to pot roast with eggs (breakfast is served all
day). To tell the truth, none of the new dishes is strikingly good,
though none is offensively bad. It's still worth getting the chili,
which is in a solid, meaty style with just a bit of hotness and an
aromatic dose of cumin.</TE>
<TE>   Some old Hollywood hangouts look set to last forever. If there's
ever a nuclear war, it won't be cockroaches that survive. It'll be
the Formosa Cafe.</TE>
<TE>   It started in 1925 when a retired prizefighter set up an old
trolley car on property owned by film stars Mary Pickford and Douglas
Fairbanks Sr. It became an actors' hangout and began accumulating too
much Hollywood history to describe. The walls are lined with
unsolicited celebrity photos going back seven decades.</TE>
<TE>   The original room, the one that started as a trolley car, is still
in use; squint hard and you can imagine Paul Newman, Marlon Brando
and Elizabeth Taylor hanging out there when they were sprouts. Other
structures have been added since, roughly quadrupling the area. The
newer parts are plusher and more dimly lit.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood connection is still lively -- the parking lot is
where Shannen Doherty allegedly smashed a beer bottle on somebody's
windshield five years ago. Despite fears that its use in a scene in
"L.A. Confidential" a few years ago would change it, this continues
to be an entertainment industry dive (a certain amount of Hollywood
business gets done here, but the conversations you overhear are more
likely to be just the usual grousing).</TE>
<TE>   The food? Basically good old American Cantonese with a couple of
not-quite-convincing Thai dishes.</TE>
<TE>   Sawdust bar with peanut shells</TE>
<TE>   "Glad to see you back," says Jay Fiondella to my musician friend,
who figures it has been about eight years since he was last at Chez
Jay.</TE>
<TE>   This is a congenial little bar, with the emphasis on "little,"
down near the Santa Monica Pier. The floor is covered with sawdust,
together with a fair number of peanut shells (Chez Jay roasts its own
and automatically gives you a bowl of them). Striped awnings hang
over the bar and the handful of tables, Christmas lights are strung
up all year round and a strange melange of stuff has been stapled to
the walls.</TE>
<TE>   Chez Jay has drawn a lot of celebrities since it opened in 1959,
and one secret is that Fiondella, an actor himself, carefully
protects them from fans and gawkers. If you have a camera on you,
he'll throw you right out.</TE>
<TE>   For a place that looks like a bar, and mostly is a bar, it serves
very creditable steaks and seafood. It still gives you the
old-fashioned relish tray of carrot and celery sticks at dinner, and
at lunch the hamburger comes with about a quarter of a cup of
mayonnaise on the side, in case you want to cast all caution aside.</TE>
<TE>   The Shack can stand for a substantial school of beach-town
divedom. Located in a cozy isolated pocket of Playa del Rey, it has
all the beachy paraphernalia and in-group jokes on the wall you could
want, and all the surfer dudes bellying up to the bar, for that
matter. Challenging a basic dive principle, the Shack has branches in
Hawaii and Santa Monica, but the landlocked one in Santa Monica, at
least, has nowhere near as much raunchy, rowdy beach vibe as the one
down where Culver Boulevard dead-ends into Pacific Coast Highway.</TE>
<TE>   Its specialty is the Shack burger, which contains a beef patty, a
split and grilled Polish sausage, mayo, lettuce and tomato, plus
American cheese and even fried onions too, if you want. Grab some
napkins -- it slips and slides and falls apart in your hands, but
it's a memorable sort of mess, largely because of the good, garlicky
sausage.</TE>
<TE>   A schooner and a pickled egg</TE>
<TE>   The wonderfully cheerful, down-to-earth Long Beach bar Joe Jost's
started pouring beer in 1933, as soon as Prohibition was repealed.
Its food goes back even further -- in its original incarnation, it
was a barbershop that sold sandwiches to its waiting customers.
Eventually the Health Department demanded that Mr. Jost choose
between cutting hair and serving food.</TE>
<TE>   It enjoys a highly loyal clientele. The wall opposite the bar is
covered with photos of regulars wearing Joe Jost's t-shirts shot in
locations all around the world, a practice known as Josting. The
remaining walls are crowded with antique beer bottles and other
nostalgia -- go to www.joejosts.com and take a virtual tour, if you
like.</TE>
<TE>   The place is famous for its pickled eggs, of which it sells about
250 a day. A wall menu lists cheese, liverwurst, salami and hot dog
sandwiches, but if you just order "a sandwich," they'll give you a
Joe's special: a hot sausage split and stuffed with cheese and a
pickle spear, wrapped in mustard-smeared rye bread. Don't ask for
another kind of bread; rye's all there is. In fact, you can buy a
loaf of Joe Jost's rye to take home.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County has its own style of diving. Several steakhouses,
such as Pinnacle Peak and Trabuco Oaks, are divey joints with a
waggish policy of cutting the necktie off anybody who wears one into
the place. Being richly provided with beaches, the county boasts a
lot of beachy dives, particularly around Newport Beach. In fact, some
denizens of Newport never cook. To them, dinner means Happy Hour
snacks. It's a whole Happy Hour way of life.</TE>
<TE>   But Laguna Beach has a unique institution in the Royal Hawaiian.
It dates from 1947, well ahead of the Polynesian craze of the '50s
and '60s, and it's still healthy -- though there's little on the menu
but the tropical cocktails and some Cantonese-style ribs to suggest
the "Polynesian cuisine" of those times. Today it's basically a
steakhouse.</TE>
<TE>   What a steakhouse, though. The grass mats on the walls and low
ceilings, the quasi-structural bamboo, the tropical plants and
aquariums -- it's a walk in the romantic dreams of a generation ago.
The striving world is very far away.</TE>
<TE>   Is this really a dive? Well, when there's big-screen TV in the bar
and you can hear Spanish-language radio as well as the Angels game on
top of the Hawaiian music soundtrack, that spells dive, if on a grand
scale. Call it a ... high dive.</TE>

<HD>Turn up the heat, and endive follows</HD>
<DH>A salad is a nice enough thing, but to truly appreciate
this vegetable's rich spectrum of flavors you have to cook it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Emily Green</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SOME say "Belgian endive," others say "endive" and yet others say
"chicory."</LD>
<LD>   In 1984, the late Jennifer Paterson, best known as one of BBC
television's "Two Fat Ladies," tried to clear up the confusion over
the bomb-shaped little vegetables. After an agreeably boozy lunch in
London sponsored by the Dutch endive growers, she dedicated a column
to it in the Spectator magazine. Belgian endive's "real, glorious
name," she said, was "witloof, like a character from one of Wagner's
operas."</LD>
<LD>   "If everybody would call it witloof," she concluded, "there
wouldn't be any trouble."</LD>
<TE>   Everybody didn't, and confusion remains between the tightly furled
little rockets called Belgian endive and the big frilly salad leaves,
also known as endive.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps we lack the resolve to get the name straight because we
use Belgian endive so sparingly. These strangely pale shoots are
hothouse vegetables, forced in heated greenhouses from transplanted
chicory roots. Farmers here and in the Netherlands take such
elaborate measures to grow them for winter tables that they are a
notable luxury, often costing from $4 to $5 a pound.</TE>
<TE>   Are they worth it? Raw, they're crunchy, bland at first, but then
carrying a pleasingly bitter edge. A few will perk up a salad. It's a
certain show of sophistication, if not one packing much pleasure.</TE>
<TE>   But where they come into their own, and become an item worth
crossing town for, is when you cook them. Only heat coaxes out a
unique and arresting spectrum of flavors that runs from sharp and
earthy to meltingly sweet.</TE>
<TE>   Sauteed, baked, braised or grilled, Belgian endive make sense of
dishes that often don't quite work with American produce. For
instance, Marcella Hazan recommends Belgian endive as a substitute
for radicchio when we can't find the mild Treviso variety traditional
in Italian cooking. The substitution saves dishes because American
radicchio can be too tough for grilling or light sauteing.</TE>
<TE>   It can stand in for radicchio in a number of ways: sweated in the
bacon pan, then stirred into risotto or spaghetti carbonara, or
melted in butter made into another pasta sauce, this time with melted
Gorgonzola and walnuts.</TE>
<TE>   To my mind, there are two ways to cook Belgian endive: slow or
slower.</TE>
<TE>   The first recipe here is adapted from a Hazan radicchio recipe.
This produces a rich, earthy side dish that can be served right from
the oven, or cold, or maybe best of all, the next day after its
flavors have intensified. Its bitter edge makes it a particularly
good side dish for veal.</TE>
<TE>   The second dish involves a long, dreamy afternoon in the kitchen.
It's an adaptation of a Julia Child recipe for Belgian endive braised
in butter that, after an hour and a half of cooking, is so rich as to
constitute a dish in itself.</TE>
<TE>   But I couldn't help turning up the luxury. Take these golden
braised endives, wrap them in prosciutto, set them in a
Parmesan-laced bechamel and broil. Invite over some people you love,
and open a bottle of Pinot Gris. This isn't dinner. This is bliss.</TE>
<TE>   Paterson and Child both recommend variations of this treatment,
using ham. The choice of prosciutto was mine.</TE>
<TE>   One can, and should, I find, gild the witloof.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baked endive</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 6</TE>
<TE>   Note: This recipe is from "The Essentials of Classic Italian
Cooking" by Marcella Hazan (Knopf, 1992).</TE>
<TE>   12 heads Belgian endive (about 2 1/4 pounds)</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 400 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   2. Trim then cut the endive in half lengthwise; wash and shake
dry. Place the endive halves, cut side down in a jellyroll pan. Add
salt and pepper to taste and the oil, distributing it evenly.</TE>
<TE>   3. Bake the endive 10 minutes and turn, then bake it another 6 to
7 minutes and turn again. Cook it until its base feels tender when
prodded with a fork, about 20 minutes longer. Allow it to settle a
few minutes before serving. It is also good at room temperature.</TE>

<TE>   Endive and prosciutto gratin</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 2 hours</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 6</TE>
<TE>   Note: This is adapted from Julia Child's recipe for braised
Belgian endive in "Mastering the Art of French Cooking" (Knopf,
1961).</TE>
<TE>   Endive</TE>
<TE>   12 firm heads Belgian endive</TE>
<TE>   5 tablespoons butter, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Juice of 1/2 small lemon, or 1 tablespoon</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup water</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 400 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   2. Trim the bottoms of the endives and discard. Wash the whole
endives under running water and shake dry. Cut the endives in half
lengthwise. Smear 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter in a 9-by-13-inch
stove-to-oven casserole. Lay the endives in it so they cover the
bottom. Sprinkle with some of the salt and half the lemon juice. Make
another layer of endives, and add more salt and lemon juice. Add the
water. Cut the remaining butter into small pieces and dot the top of
the endives. Cover and simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes.
Uncover and boil rapidly until the liquid is reduced to 2 or 3
tablespoons, for about another 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   3. Place a sheet of buttered wax paper over the pan, cover with a
lid and place in the oven. Reduce the heat to 325 degrees. Bake for 1
hour. Remove the casserole cover but leave the wax paper and bake
until the endives are golden, about 20 to 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Cheese sauce</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons butter</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons flour</TE>
<TE>   2 cups milk</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly grated nutmeg</TE>
<TE>   1 ounce finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</TE>
<TE>   2 ounces medium-grated Swiss cheese</TE>
<TE>   1. Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed, medium-sized saucepan over
medium heat, then stir in the flour until smooth. Cook 2 to 3 minutes
to get rid of the raw flour taste. Remove from the heat and set
aside.</TE>
<TE>   2. Bring 2 cups of milk to boil in a small saucepan and add the
grated nutmeg, about 11 passes on the grater. Whisk the heated milk
into the roux, followed by the Parmigiano-Reggiano and Swiss cheeses.
As it thickens, cover and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly</TE>
<TE>   12 slices prosciutto, trimmed of fat edges (about 1/3 pound)</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons grated Swiss cheese</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon butter, cubed</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the broiler and set a rack in the middle of the oven.</TE>
<TE>   2. Butter a shallow 2-quart baking dish. Add half of the cheese

<TE>   3. Lay the prosciutto slices on a work surface. Add 2 endive
halves to a prosciutto slice, then roll the slice up over the endives
to form a bundle. Repeat with the remaining endive halves and
prosciutto slices. Neatly arrange the 12 prosciutto-endive wraps in
the baking dish.</TE>
<TE>   4. Cover the wraps with the remaining cheese sauce. Sprinkle with
the Swiss cheese and dot with the butter. Set the dish in the oven
and broil until bubbling and the cheese has browned a bit, 3 to 4
minutes. You'll want to do this just before you serve dinner so that
the dish is nice and hot.</TE>

<LD>SOME may find it tacky, a little pushy perhaps, but advertising in
restaurant menus seems to have arrived.</LD>
<LD>   At the Cheesecake Factory, not only are there 200 menu items to
choose from, there are also plumbers, roofers, upholsterers and a
plastic surgeon. Higher-end restaurants like Giorgio Baldi and
Campanile aren't immune to the trend either, though they tend to hawk
their own products or the places that sell them.</LD>
<LD>   There may be no place more brazen about menu advertising than the
Cheesecake Factory, a chain of 57 restaurants in 20 states. The
restaurant's spiral notebook of a menu is as much a service catalog
as it is a food-and-drink list. For almost every laminated page of
menu, there's a facing page of advertising. "We're such a busy
restaurant that it not only gives the customers something to look at,
it's also a great place for advertisers," says Howard Gordon, the
senior president of business development and marketing for the chain.
"People have come to expect it in our menu; it's part of the
entertainment."</LD>
<TE>   It's also a clever business maneuver: Menu Dynamics, a Southern
California company, sells the ads and produces the menus for no
charge to the restaurant. In return, advertisers pay Menu Dynamics
$5,000 for each six-month, full page ad.</TE>
<TE>   For the advertisers, results have been mixed.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't gotten a single call in the last four months," says
Robert Simon of Simon &amp; Simon Plumbing, who advertises in the
Brentwood menu.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Susan Gordon, a real estate agent in Sherman
Oaks, says, "I've gotten an unbelievable amount of exposure. People
stop me on the street."</TE>
<TE>   At finer restaurants, the menus promote the house-label products
and the chef's cookbooks. Ads are placed in a more discreet manner
amid the evening's specials.</TE>
<TE>   Still, when Elena Baldi was asked about the logos in her menu for
Gelson's Markets, Santa Monica Seafood, Vicente Foods, Lazy Acres
Market, Pacific Coast Greens Market and Wally's, she bristled.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not advertising," she said. "It's just a way for people to
know where our sauces are sold."</TE>
<TE>   At Campanile, manager Jessica Buonocore also prefers to describe
the pictures of cookbooks by Mark Peel and Nancy Silverton and the
prices listed underneath as information.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only do these chefs have books," she says, "but they're
available to purchase right here at the restaurant and at the
bakery."</TE>
<TE>   Cash or credit will do just fine.</TE>

<HD>The chef's whim, please</HD>
<DH>Ask the kitchen to serve whatever it wants, then wait for
the adventure to begin.</DH>

<AU>David Shaw</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There aren't many experiences in life that give me a greater sense of
anticipation than reading a new menu in a good restaurant.
Nevertheless, most of the best meals of my life have come when I
never looked at the menu -- when I just told our waiter, "We'll have
whatever the chef feels like cooking tonight."</LD>
<LD>   That may sound presumptuous and cavalier, and I wouldn't recommend
you try it at your local Sizzler. But at a fine restaurant, that
suggestion can serve as a passport to bliss.</LD>
<LD>   "I love to cook that way," says Jean-Pierre Bosc, the chef at
Mimosa bistro in West Hollywood. "It's a way to do things I don't
usually do here. People who want me to do that really appreciate
food, and I want to satisfy them."</LD>
<TE>   Like most of us -- maybe more than most of us -- chefs grow weary
of routine. They're eager to escape the tyranny of the menu. Ask any
serious chef to describe his ideal restaurant, and chances are the
first two things you'll hear will be (1) "I'd like a small place,
just six or eight tables," and (2) "I'd like to be able to cook
whatever I want, based on what's in season and what looks good at the
market that day and whatever inspiration I have."</TE>
<TE>   So why not give the chef a chance to live the dream, however
briefly -- for your benefit. Almost invariably, the surprise -- not
knowing what's coming next, eating something new -- makes for a true
dining adventure.</TE>
<TE>   I've done this over the years at more restaurants than I could
shake a fork at -- among them, Valentino, Spago Beverly Hills,
Vincenti, Melisse and Yujean Kang locally and similar restaurants
elsewhere, here and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Some chefs at casual restaurants also enjoy the spontaneity of
cooking off the menu, but a high-end restaurant -- with a larger
kitchen staff and, usually, a more talented chef -- is a more likely
choice for this kind of special dinner.</TE>
<TE>   I know what you're thinking. "Sure, Shaw, that's easy for you; you
write about food and wine for the Los Angeles Times, so these chefs
know you and want to make you happy."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it helps if the chef knows you and your tastes, whether
you're a journalist or just a steady customer. But I've been putting
myself in various chefs' hands for almost 25 years, starting long
before I'd written a word about food or wine anywhere. It was my
enthusiasm for the dining experience -- and my eagerness to let chefs
experiment on me -- that helped me to get to know several chefs and
restaurateurs long before most of them had any idea what I do for a
living.</TE>
<TE>   I still recall the first time a chef in France asked to make a
"special" dinner for my wife and me, simply because we -- two
unknown, then-unsophisticated Americans -- had been so appreciative
of his food the night before.</TE>
<TE>   The chef? Marc Meneau, at L'Esperance in Burgundy. The dinner?
Truffles and fresh foie gras on toast. Jellied consomme of lobster
with caviar. A salad of spinach, mushrooms, onions and sweetbreads.
St. Pierre fish cooked en papillote and served with a watercress
sauce. Cold chicken stuffed with a mousse of its own liver and
braised with Port. Assorted cheeses. An apple tart. A raspberry tart.
Fresh fruit salad. Petits fours.</TE>
<TE>   Magnifique.</TE>
<TE>   Memorable meals</TE>
<TE>   As that meal makes clear, if you let a chef make all the
decisions, he may try to dazzle you with expensive ingredients. I've
been startled by a few bills that were much higher than I was
accustomed to in those particular restaurants. But chefs don't have
to use products with Tiffany price tags to please you -- or
themselves. Nor do you have to eat a six- or eight-course feast to
have the full experience.</TE>
<TE>   I had lunch a couple of weeks ago at the Water Grill in downtown
Los Angeles with a friend who had to make an early-afternoon meeting.
We told our waiter, "We'll take anything the kitchen wants to send
out -- but just three courses, including dessert."</TE>
<TE>   Chef Michael Cimarusti cheated a little by starting us (quickly)
with a tiny amuse-bouche of Olympia and Belon oysters in a broth of
chopped heirloom tomatoes, soy sauce and virgin olive oil. But then
we had just one appetizer (California spiny lobster on a large
porcini mushroom cap); a main course (rougets with fall vegetables
roasted in duck fat confit); and, from pastry chef Won Yee Tom, one
dessert (apple beignets with pecan ice cream).</TE>
<TE>   It was all so good that my friend was tempted to cancel his
meeting and ask for an encore.</TE>
<TE>   Remember: Everyone who performs likes an appreciative audience,
and good chefs do perform, whether they're making three courses or
eight, using caviar or cauliflower. So they welcome an opportunity to
strut their stuff -- especially in diet-conscious Los Angeles, where
so many customers seem to have the same discouraging mantra: "Green
salad, no dressing, broiled fish, no sauce, no dessert, herbal iced
tea."</TE>
<TE>   Gino Angelini at Osteria Angelini enjoys working with organ meats,
but many Angelenos shudder at the mere prospect, and that disappoints
him. So I don't know who's happier -- Angelini cooking or me eating
-- when I put myself in his hands with only one request: "Innards --
kidneys, brains, tripe, whatever."</TE>
<TE>   I still have vivid memories of -- I can still taste -- several
other dishes I've had over the years only because I didn't order from
the menu. But leaving dinner to the chef is not about individual
dishes; it's about the orchestration of an entire meal so that the
dishes build, one after the other, with variety and balance and
harmony.</TE>
<TE>   The best dining experience of my life came on my honeymoon, when
we dined four consecutive days at Fredy Girardet in Crissier,
Switzerland; before we even opened our menus the first night,
Girardet suggested that he orchestrate all four meals "so your dining
experience here will be a single, harmonious unit."</TE>
<TE>   My wife and I had 34 courses over the next four days, and
virtually every one was spectacular, from the first appetizer the
first night (a compote of baby rabbit and baby vegetables en gelee)
to the last dessert on the last day (an apple and chocolate croquette
accompanied by a soup and souffle, both made with wild strawberries).</TE>
<TE>   Several L.A. restaurants now follow the French tradition of
offering a tasting menu -- several smaller courses, chosen and
orchestrated by the chef -- a formalized version of my "Leave it to
the chef" suggestion. But even chefs without a tasting menu may
welcome the chance to be creative, and those with a tasting menu may
be happy to depart from it if they sense your spirit of adventure.</TE>
<TE>   Chef's night off?</TE>
<TE>   Not every good chef advises such adventure.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, it'd a great challenge for the chef and it's stimulating,"
says Joachim Splichal, the chef behind Patina and the Pinot Bistros.
"But in my opinion, it's better to stick to the menu. If you leave it
up to the kitchen, and the chef himself is not there that night, you
might not get the same brilliance from a creative standpoint, and
then the customer is disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   When I recommend leaving dinner choices up to the chef, I worry
more, though, about the picky eater than I do about the absentee
chef.</TE>
<TE>   You can't say, "I'll have whatever the chef feels like cooking,
but I'm allergic to shellfish and I don't like nuts and I don't want
anything with butter or cream and I don't eat veal because I feel
sorry for those poor calves and I like everything well-done."</TE>
<TE>   This doesn't mean you have to like everything. I don't like
coconut or okra. If you have gastronomic, aesthetic, medical or
political objections to a particular foodstuff -- or if you're
allergic to something -- you should say so. I once took a vegetarian
friend to a restaurant with a great French chef, and he happily made
her a multi-course extravaganza composed entirely of vegetables and
grains.</TE>
<TE>   What matters is not so much what you eat -- or don't eat -- but
that you approach the experience with an open mind, a sense of
adventure and anticipation and a genuine eagerness to try something
new.</TE>

<TE>   Forgoing the menu?</TE>
<TE>   Pick the right restaurant. The chef at a good bistro or trattoria
may be happy to be spontaneous, but a high-end restaurant is a more
likely to welcome the request.</TE>
<TE>   Make sure the chef is there. In this era of superstar chefs with
burgeoning restaurant empires, there's a good possibility someone
else is in the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Expect to spend more time and money. But do tell your waiter if
you have budgetary or time constraints.</TE>
<TE>   Make your wishes clear. If you're allergic to something or don't
like something -- or if you'd like your dinner to include a certain
item or dish -- say so.</TE>
<TE>   Don't be picky.  No long lists of do's and don'ts.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, the chef has a life too. Don't expect anyone to prepare
a special menu at 8:30 on a busy Saturday night, or at 10:30 any
night.</TE>

<LD>Perfect caramel</LD>
<LD>   (it's not hard to do)</LD>
<LD>   To achieve caramel worthy of the Brittany effect, you need the
best butter and cream. This used to pose a problem in L.A., where
good fresh cream was as rare as hen's teeth. Then six months ago, the
Straus Family Creamery of Marin County began sending its fresh cream
south. It is so sweet, so rich, it could have even the most hardened
futurist extolling the virtues of the good old days. A 16-ounce
bottle is $2.99, plus $1 bottle deposit, at Whole Foods Porter Ranch,
Torrance, Woodland Hills, Park La Brea, West Hollywood, Hillcrest and
San Diego.</LD>
<TE>   Equipment: The done-ness of caramel sauce and caramel ice cream
can be "eyeballed," but candy thermometers are essential to making
caramel candy. The boiling point for soft candy is 240-250 degrees;
for medium, 250-255 degrees; and for hard, 262-267 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Fancy kitchenware shops sell digital candy thermometers, but
simpler models without batteries and moving parts that can drop into
molten sugar are best.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, keep a pot of water with a pastry brush on hand to
moisten the sides of the pan if they overheat and begin to burn the
caramel.</TE>
<TE>   Safety: Cooking sugar is one of the more dangerous activities in
the kitchen, capable of inflicting some of the most serious burns. Do
not be tempted to lean over the pan to smell the caramel, do not
taste it directly from the cooking pot and add all ingredients --
butter, cream and flavorings -- slowly and carefully so they don't
boil over.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble-shooting: Sugar can crystallize if it is overcooked or
heated unevenly. If this happens, and your candy tastes grainy, melt
it down, adding a bit of water, stirring gently, to evenly re-cook.
Then re-set.</TE>

<LD>THE Santa Ynez wine country north of Santa Barbara is as beautiful as
any in the world. Though a surprising number of wineries, large and
small, are sprinkled through its rolling hills, the region still
retains its rural character. Unlike the Napa Valley, Santa Ynez has
managed to resist becoming a wine-themed Disneyland and seems
relatively untouched by blatant commercialism.</LD>
<LD>   But in the midst of all this riveting landscape, and its miles of
vines, there hasn't really been anywhere to eat other than a
steakhouse in Buellton. A sad state of affairs.</LD>
<LD>   A good wine-country restaurant has been a long time coming. And in
June, Brothers Restaurant at Mattei's Tavern opened in Los Olivos,
and now the old stagecoach stop is ablaze with lights. Practically
every spot in the ample parking lot is taken. The place is
practically humming with energy.</LD>
<TE>   The drive up Highway 154 from Santa Barbara toward the San Marcos
pass is a wonderful one. The winding road climbs past blue-shadowed
mountains, a silvery lake and gold-furred hills to arrive, after less
than an hour, at the little town of Los Olivos: population 1,000. For
anybody with dinner in mind, Brothers' casual charm beckons at the
edge of the sleepy little town.</TE>
<TE>   Brothers is the namesake of brothers Matt and Jeff Nichols, who
are its chefs and owners. This restaurant is actually the sequel to
the much smaller place they had in Solvang a few years back. They
could never quite make a go of it there (not enough Danish tchotchkes
for visitors in pursuit of the quaint?). At any rate, they closed it
and took some time off. When Mattei's Tavern came up as a
possibility, the two jumped on it. Still, it took two years to
negotiate the lease and renovate the 1886 building.</TE>
<TE>   The food at the reborn Brothers is not only delicious but
perfectly pitched to what locals and wine-country visitors want to
eat. More bistro than formal restaurant, Brothers neatly sidesteps
the pretentiousness that makes dining in so many wine-country
restaurants more chore than full-blown pleasure. Walk into Brothers
and you're greeted by a dynamic hostess in full western regalia --
suede-fringed jacket, turquoise jewelry and cowboy boots. She makes
you comfortable at the bar or pulls out a chair in front of the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Glimpse of the past</TE>
<TE>   Waiting for friends to arrive one night, I roamed the room, taking
in the framed black-and-white photos of the days when Los Olivos was
a stagecoach stop between Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo. Over by
the desk, a glass case displays old guest books from the early years
of the last century, with reservations for dinner or rooms written
out in an accomplished hand, ornamented with bold curlicues. I can
almost hear the pen scratching across the ledger, taking down "party
of six at 6:30 p.m.; four at 4:45 p.m."</TE>
<TE>   One of the dining rooms, papered in flocked red velvet, with tall
windows and white-swathed tables, probably looks much the same as it
did then. The open kitchen and TV in the bar are the sole modern
touches -- that and the cooking. Brothers' succinct one-page menu
changes every few weeks, supplemented each night by a couple of
specials.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, summer's beguiling sweet corn soup has made way for
an earthy potato and leek soup laced with applewood-smoked bacon,
and, on my last visit, a brilliant orange kabocha squash puree
swirled with creme fraiche. Fat Asian spring rolls, stuffed with a
bright julienne of vegetables and fried crisp and golden, are
regulars on the menu, delicious dragged across the spicy fresh plum
sauce.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers turn out pretty salads too, such as baby greens
embellished with wine-stained pears, creamy blue-veined Stilton and
candied walnuts. Another good one is hearts of romaine tossed in a
mild roasted garlic dressing and showered with Parmesan shavings that
carry a nutty twang.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to loftier dishes, this kitchen doesn't miss a beat.
Foie gras, seared to a perfect rose pink, is set off by luscious
spiced apples and a drizzle of true, aged balsamic vinegar that has
the color and texture of molasses.</TE>
<TE>   The service comes in on the correct note, mostly very
professional, without veering over into chilly formality. In other
words, it suits the spirit and style of the restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to main courses, think prime rib, because Brothers'
is the best I've had in recent memory. As one of the chefs will
explain, they built a special oven so they can slow-roast it
overnight. Whatever that oven does, it's magic. The beef is
incredibly flavorful and comes with good mashed potatoes, a crock of
horseradish cream -- and its glorious jus.</TE>
<TE>   The veal chop is an anomaly among veal chops -- it actually tastes
like something. Charred but still juicy, it's accompanied by mashed
potatoes punched up with piquant whole-grain mustard. A thick Iowa
pork chop comes to the table with a dollop of irresistible lemon
chive butter melting over the top. There's also a fine lemon-roasted
half chicken with thyme sauce -- a classic with a restrained
contemporary twist.</TE>
<TE>   A skillful simplicity</TE>
<TE>   These are the kinds of unfussy dishes anybody would be happy to
eat over and over (something that locals particularly appreciate).
Brothers' kitchen relies more on great products and skillful cooking
than unbridled creativity, and sometimes that's a good thing. The
menu reads like a beloved cookbook you keep coming back to when the
latest overproduced tome loses its glamour. The brothers' perfect
sense of what works in Los Olivos is one more reason Brothers is
already one of my favorite restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   That said, it's a young restaurant, and, although its wine list
offers a decent selection of local wines, including the Chardonnay
from former Spago sommelier Michael Bonaccorsi, it could have more
depth. But they've done so much in only a few months, so it's hard to
quibble.</TE>
<TE>   Come dessert, that small boy demolishing a tall wedge of mud pie
knows what's what. I just hope the coffee ice cream won't keep him up
all night.</TE>
<TE>   If that doesn't suit, maybe the gooey delicious fudge brownie
sundae with roasted banana ice cream will, or a crumbly shortcake
slathered in berries and vanilla bean ice cream. Or the perfectly
classic creme brulee with a burnt-sugar lid that shatters at the
first touch of your spoon.</TE>
<TE>   It's not often that a sequel turns out to be better than the
original. Brothers is back, and this time I have a feeling it's going
to be a long run.</TE>

<LD>Dear SOS: I would love the recipe for the wild rice salad from the
Gulfstream Restaurant in Newport Beach. It was totally addictive. We
ordered seconds.</LD>
<LD>   Mary Ann Osborn</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles</LD>
<TE>   Dear Mary Ann: What a good salad for this time of year, and what a
good salad to take to a Thanksgiving celebration. And here's
something nice -- you can combine the fig-nut-onion mixture the day
before (cover and refrigerate), then cook the rice and toss with the
mixture the day of. It's a little do-ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Gulfstream wild rice salad</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 4-6</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1 cup wild rice</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup finely chopped dried figs</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup chopped toasted pecans</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup chopped toasted unsalted cashews</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup finely chopped green onion tops</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons finely chopped celery</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons finely chopped red onion</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons raspberry vinegar or red wine vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup vegetable oil</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup olive oil</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1. Combine 4 cups of water and 1 teaspoon of salt in a saucepan
and bring to a boil. Add the rice. Reduce the heat to medium-low,
cover and simmer until the rice is tender, about 45 minutes. Drain
well and cool.</TE>
<TE>   2. Transfer the rice to a large bowl. Mix in the figs, pecans,
cashews, green onion tops, celery and red onion.</TE>
<TE>   3. Mix the vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, mustard and sugar in a
blender. With the blender running, gradually mix in the vegetable and
olive oils. Pour the dressing over the rice mixture and toss. Season
salad with salt and pepper to taste.</TE>

<LD>Dear SOS: I hope you still have in your files a recipe for
albondigas. I had it for a long time but I lost it. Thank you in
advance for your help.</LD>
<LD>   E. Westerhaut</LD>
<LD>   Downey</LD>
<TE>   Dear E.: This recipe ran in October 1991. Albondigas are usually
served in a soup, but these would be great over hot rice. For
all-beef meatballs, use 2 pounds of ground beef and omit the pork.</TE>

it, caring for it like a family member. She might have passed it on
to the next generation, where it again was prized for its even
heating, its ability to create a crispy brown crust and cook without
added fat.</LD>
<LD>   Then again, the old pan might have wound up gathering dust on a
shelf in the garage. Who has time to spend seasoning a skillet? Are
you kidding?</LD>
<LD>   Someone at Lodge Manufacturing Co., the kings of cast-iron
cookware, must have asked the same thing. They've introduced a line
of pre-seasoned cast-iron cookware. No need to rub the pan with oil
or shortening, then bake it at 300 degrees for an hour, repeating
several more times. Just remove the price tag and start cooking.</LD>
<TE>   The pans, which have a slightly rough surface compared to the
smooth inside of the traditional ones, are coated with a vegetable
oil formula and baked in very hot industrial ovens. "We should have
thought of this 100 years ago," the labels say.</TE>
<TE>   Given that a top aluminum skillet can run $200, who wouldn't want
one that costs $10 and was good enough for Grandma? So we cracked
some eggs, readied some burgers and put a new 8-inch pre-seasoned pan
to the test. Its competition: our trusty cast-iron skillet found 20
years ago at a thrift store.</TE>
<TE>   Our old pan performed as perfectly as ever: fried eggs slid like
hockey pucks right onto our plate. We felt like short-order cooks.
Fried in a pat of butter over medium-high heat, the egg's edges were
browned, its bottom evenly colored and the sunny-side-up yolk in one
place.</TE>
<TE>   The new pan was more stubborn; each time the thinnest part of the
egg white stuck, forcing us to scrape at it with a spatula. On the
last try, the white broke into pieces. Cleaning the skillet, then,
was tougher (soap is not recommended; just a stiff brush and hot
water).</TE>
<TE>   The new cookware calls for spraying with nonstick spray after
cleaning and before cooking. For the eggs, we sprayed and added
butter. We didn't add butter to either pan for burger patties, fried
over medium-high heat, and they didn't stick. But the new skillet
smoked.</TE>
<TE>   In our final test of frozen hash browns, the cooking spray thing
was a puzzler, since the potato bag directed us to fry in a few
tablespoons of oil. Oil and spray? But maybe it was that combo that
earned our respect for the new pan; its hash browns were crispy,
evenly browned, even a little crusty. Our old skillet's were ho-hum
ordinary.</TE>
<TE>   What would Grandma say? Well, she might give a nod to the new
skillet, but the frozen hash browns thing, we're not so sure.</TE>

<TE>   What's the difference: Time, elbow grease required to season. If
rust develops (always seems to), scour, repeat seasoning process.
Still, reminds us of Grandma.</TE>

egg?</TE>
<TE>   How much: $7-$15 at stores and on the Internet.</TE>

<TE>   What's the difference: Convenience. You don't have to coat it with
grease and bake it several times. It's been done for you. But it
still needs some extra care (coating with cooking spray after
cleaning).</TE>
<TE>   What we thought: Our fried eggs stuck big-time, but our hash
browns went over big. Ten bucks? OK, we'll spring. We just need to
figure out the cooking spray thing.</TE>

<LD>Charmaine Solomon's 1976 work "The Complete Asian Cookbook" served as
an early bible for many cooks wanting to learn about Asian food. A
Sri Lankan who resettled in Australia, Solomon taught Asian cooking
and wrote more cookbooks, including one of vegetarian recipes.</LD>
<LD>   "Complete Vegetarian Cookbook," first published in Australia in
1990, has been updated and reissued this year (Ten Speed Press,
$39.95), and somewhat curiously. It joins a pack of new books geared
to every kind of vegetarian, while Solomon calls hers "a guidebook
for the middle-of-the road vegetarian."</LD>
<LD>   In other words, milk does not have to be nonfat, flour is not
always whole-wheat, and there is no attempt to simulate meat with
tofu products or wheat gluten. Bean curd and gluten do appear, but in
recipes where they would be used, such as bean curd in Indonesian
gado gado.</LD>
<TE>   "Middle-of-the-road" may be misleading, though, since this book is
as international as Solomon's Asian book. It's not as well-defined,
however. Recipes skip from cuisine to cuisine, without any
separation. The two broad divisions, "Western Influence" and "
"Eastern Influence," could be a sneaky way to inject logic into a
book that ranges from fettuccine Alfredo to South Indian yogurt rice.
A final "East Meets West" section is harder to figure; it focuses on
breakfast, breads and beverages.</TE>
<TE>   The origin of the recipes is not always defined, but this may not
matter to people more interested in meatless cooking than in a
culinary education. The recipes do offer extraordinary variety. A
carrot and saffron soup, modeled on a French seafood dish, is a nice
but thin and lacking carrot character. Steamed potatoes with spiced
yogurt must be Indian or Sri Lankan, judging by the ghee, turmeric,
yogurt and garam masala.</TE>
<TE>   Toast of the shah, one of the Eastern desserts, is India's answer
to French toast or bread pudding, only much more ornate and
extravagantly rich. One seldom sees this dessert in Indian
restaurants here, so it is nice to have a recipe as good as this one.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly enough, Solomon prefers vegetarian food. Her book of
more than 600 recipes surely hasn't lost its appeal; it still
delivers vegetarian food that sounds good rather than contrived
dishes heavy on starches and beans.</TE>

<HD>The cowboys ride into Napa</HD>
<DH>A pair of former cattle ranchers have resurrected a
historic Howell Mountain winery and are proving that quality Cabernet
can come from on high.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rod Smith</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>HIGH above the northeast Napa Valley, one of California's original
wine estates is being brought back to life by cowboys. Pat and Anne
Stotesbury left Montana cattle ranching behind to grow Cabernet
Sauvignon vines on the rugged flanks of Howell Mountain and make wine
in a massive stone winery.</LD>
<LD>   The 1886 building dominates the mountain ridge like a ruined
medieval castle. It was full of rattlesnakes and bats when the
Stotesburys tore off the roof to begin renovation; now it is swarming
with workers. Meanwhile, the Stotesburys expanded the original
barrel-aging cave underneath, and their first few vintages of Ladera
Vineyards Cabernet rest there now.</LD>
<LD>   " 'Ladera' means hillside in Spanish. We chose that name because
we think the best wines come from mountain vineyards," explains Pat
Stotesbury, a wiry man who inhabits a huge white cowboy hat and walks
like someone who'd rather be riding.</LD>
<TE>   He and his wife, Anne, went to Napa Valley one summer when a film
company leased their log cabin in Montana. "That was the trip that
changed our lives," she says. They now own two mountain vineyards,
the Howell Mountain property (purchased in 2000) and another on Mt.
Veeder (1998), both 75 acres and both originally planted in 1877.</TE>
<TE>   Howell Mountain is a world above the world, as remote from the
Napa Valley as the Sierra Nevada or the Pacific Ocean. And yet it is
an important part of the valley -- not just an elevated subregion
within the Napa Valley appellation but a long-term source of some of
the valley's best grapes and wines, and thus a pillar of its
reputation.</TE>
<TE>   It's better described as a forested plateau than a mountain.
Unlike the more immediately accessible mountains on the valley's west
side, Howell Mountain does not appear to be a geological extension of
the valley but rather a great mass, like Mt. St. Helena, crouched
above and beyond it.</TE>
<TE>   Before Prohibition, Howell Mountain was the second-best-known wine
district in the valley, after Rutherford. But the wineries and
vineyards on the mountain were largely forgotten until 1983, when
Howell Mountain became the first subordinate appellation within the
Napa Valley American Viticultural Area.</TE>
<TE>   Cool days, warm nights</TE>
<TE>   Howell Mountain's vineyards are between 1,400 feet and 2,500 feet
above sea level -- putting them among the highest in the world. These
vines see significantly more sunshine every day than vineyards lower
down.</TE>
<TE>   But longer days don't necessarily mean more heat. At that
altitude, the days are cooler than on the valley floor, and because
the vineyards are above the valley's inversion layer (warmer air
sitting on top of cooler air), the nights tend to be warmer. The
climate brings out striking qualities in the grapes. There's a
balance of intense, almost rough, concentration and piercing clarity
in Howell Mountain reds that reflects the ethereal brightness of
mountain sunshine.</TE>
<TE>   That's augmented by the mountain's soils. Unlike the valley floor
and the western slopes, where sedimentary and alluvial soils dominate
and soil profiles can vary widely within small areas, Howell Mountain
has volcanic soils in just a few variations. These lean, well-drained
soils give wines with exceptional definition and structure.</TE>
<TE>   The first Ladera Vineyards Cabernets are a good example of what
the mountain can do. Like other notable Howell Mountain Cabs, from
producers such as Dunn, Beringer and Duckhorn, they are striking for
their structured richness and fruit-weighted balance, and their
voluminous breadth and depth.</TE>
<TE>   Winemaker Karen Culler is a veteran of wineries such as Vichon and
knows valley floor Cabernet well. Howell Mountain Cabernet is a
different animal entirely, she says: "The big things up here are the
well-drained, gravelly red soil and the cooler days. In the morning
you might think it will get up to a hundred degrees, but the
afternoon doesn't get much hotter. And the nights are warmer, so the
temperature differential is smaller. That gives you big, full-bodied
wines that are soft too."</TE>
<TE>   The inaugural Ladera Howell Mountain Cab '01 is just that. I
tasted barrel samples from two different pickings. They showed
incredible color, high-toned fragrance and intense flavors, with
thick, chewy tannin and bright acidity. But those Howell Mountain
traits were expressed in two subtly different ways, showing the
effect harvest timing can have on style in a well-situated vineyard.
The early-picked wine had a cut-crystal definition and vertical
structure, while the later pick was broader and richer.</TE>
<TE>   A storied past</TE>
<TE>   There's a lot of history here. The winery was built in 1886 as the
Nouveau Medoc Wine Cellars by two Bordeaux businessmen, Jean Adolphe
Brun and W.J. Chaix. In the happy days before Prohibition it pumped a
tannic red river of "Napa Valley Claret" (primarily Zinfandel)
through the Rutherford train station to the firm's cellars under San
Francisco's Financial District.</TE>
<TE>   At one time the winery was surrounded by acres of red and white
grapes planted in the late 1870s. After Prohibition, however, the
vineyards were reclaimed by nature and the hulking winery became the
haunt of twilight creatures.</TE>
<TE>   The property languished until it was rescued in 1980 by yet
another pair of Bordelais, Francis and Francoise Dewavrin-Woltner,
former owners of the famous Chateau La Mission Haut-Brion in
Bordeaux. Ironically, after living with Cabernet Sauvignon all their
lives the Woltners devoted their New World estate exclusively to
Chardonnay.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the rootstock they chose was phylloxera-susceptible
AXR-1, and the vicious root-sucking aphid did the vineyard in. When
the Stotesburys bought the property in 2000, they immediately
replanted with Cabernet, Merlot and other red Bordeaux grapes on
resistant rootstocks.</TE>
<TE>   And they took the opportunity to define the property in 12 main
vine blocks, each with six sub-blocks. Each unit has its own grape
varieties, clones and rootstocks.</TE>
<TE>   As the vines mature, tasting separate barrel lots of young wine
from different vine blocks will be like drawing a sensory map of the
estate's terroir.</TE>

<HD>2001 La Gauphine Viognier, Vin de Pays d'Oc</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>-- S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A French Viognier for about $10? I was skeptical. "Probably comes
from a big producer," I thought, "and certainly not from anywhere
near Condrieu," that being the town in the northern Rhone most
identified with this glorious but fickle white grape.</LD>
<LD>   I was wrong on the first count, right on the second. Planting
Rhone varietals is as fashionable in France as it is in California.
La Gauphine, in fact, is a small estate near the Saint Chinian region
of the Languedoc.</LD>
<LD>   What's more important is how Viognier performs there. Pale green
gold in color, this aromatic white wine gives off scents of ripe
peaches, apricots and something vaguely tropical. It's not bone-dry,
so it tastes very round and ripe, like peach skin squirted with a
little citrus. Keep a bottle in the fridge for unexpected company.</LD>

<LD>In conjunction with its "Drawing Dreams" exhibition of the work of
production designer Dante Ferretti, the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences is presenting a program of film clips and speakers
titled "Arresting Images" on Thursday at its Samuel Goldwyn Theater.
The academy developed the event in cooperation with the Art Directors
Guild.</LD>
<LD>   A committee of art directors worked for many months "to come up
with a way of looking at the challenges production designers have
faced over time," says Ellen Harrington, exhibition curator and
special events programmer at the academy.</LD>
<LD>   "The designer's job is really to create a world in which all of
the emotional impact of the film can take place. Much of that comes
from the designer's vision, and yet over time they have faced so many
different physical production challenges. The show starts out at the
silent era and comes all the way to the present," she says, and
illustrates "how art directors respond to controlled lightning or
sound stage versus shooting on the back lot."</LD>
<TE>   Film clips range from Georges Melies "A Trip to the Moon" (1902)
to last year's "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring."
Speakers include designers Robert Boyle, Terence Marsh, John
Mansbridge, Ida Random and producer Polly Platt, who is hosting the
evening.</TE>
<TE>   The Art Directors Guild says it is thrilled with the attention
because designers feel their contributions to films play second
fiddle to directors and cinematographers.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't do our job, they have nothing to expose the negative
on," says designer Tom Walsh. "We are the first invited to the party
and often the first to be forgotten on the day of the party. I think
with 'Arresting Images,' it's a great opportunity for us to toot our
own horn."</TE>
<TE>   In collaboration with the academy, the UCLA Film &amp; Television
Archive has put together a film festival paying tribute to production
design. The three-week celebration, "The Art of Hollywood," kicks off
Saturday evening with "The Godfather, Part II," which was designed by
Dean Tavoularis.</TE>
<TE>   Other movies in the festival are the offbeat 1930 sci-fi musical
"Just Imagine" and the 1966 sci-fi thriller "Fantastic Voyage" (Nov.
10 matinee), the 1928 silent classics "The Crowd" and "The Wind"
(Nov. 10 evening); Stanley Kubrick's "Barry Lyndon" (Nov. 21); and
Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo" (Nov. 24). Henry Bumstead, the
87-year-old production designer on "Vertigo," is scheduled to speak.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a good assortment of films," Walsh says. "Obviously,

<HD>Rapper's upbeat spirit recalled</HD>
<DH>'Jam Master Jay,' who died by the gun despite eschewing
violence, is memorialized</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geraldine Baum</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>QUEENS, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Stepping out of a long, white limousine, the young widow of Jason
"Jam Master Jay" Mizell and her three young sons wore wide-brimmed
black fedoras and black leather jackets as they marched somberly into
an overflowing church. The boys also wore white Adidas sneakers --
the signature attire of their slain father, who pioneered not only
the thumping, scratching music of rap but much of the culture around
it.</LD>
<LD>   Mizell, DJ of the seminal rap group Run-DMC, was memorialized at a
funeral service in this New York borough Tuesday as a hero, a man who
revolutionized a nascent hip-hop culture in the early 1980s and
served as its role model for the generations to come.</LD>
<LD>   "He might not have lived long," said the Rev. Floyd H. Flake,
leader of the Allen A.M.E. Cathedral, where the service was held,
"but he lived well by contributions to his community."</LD>
<TE>   Mizell, 37, was slain a week ago by a masked gunman who put a
single bullet in his head while he played video games with friends in
the lounge of his Queens recording studio. Police are investigating
several theories about who might have taken the life of a man whose
group eschewed violence in its popular rap lyrics. So far, there are
no suspects, according to police.</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by funeral wreaths in vibrant colors, some shaped like
turntables and musical notes, Mizell's bandmates Joseph "Run" Simmons
and Darryl "DMC" McDaniel remembered their friend as upbeat and
fun-loving, a partyer, fashion innovator and devoted family man.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's not ask why Jason is gone; Jason did what he was supposed
to do," Simmons said, looking at an audience not only of family and
neighbors but also the elite of the East Coast rap industry,
including Simmons' brother Russell Simmons, an entertainment
entrepreneur and hip-hop activist, LL Cool J, Chuck D and Professor
Griff of Public Enemy, Foxy Brown, Jermaine Dupri, the members of A
Tribe Called Quest including Q Tip, and many others.</TE>
<TE>   The turnout was no surprise to police, who were out in force, nor
to hundreds of young kids off from school because of election day.
They waited hours in the streets around the church to ogle the
funeral procession.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoa, there's Foxy," said Milton Jackson, a 20-year-old junior at
St. John's University who strained to see the rap celebrities as they
got out of their SUVs and black sedans and headed into church. "She's
even prettier than I thought."</TE>
<TE>   Run-DMC was the most significant group to shape hip-hop, these
youngsters insisted, explaining that the three members were the first
rappers with a full-length album, first with a gold album, first with
a platinum album, first with a multi-platinum album, first on MTV,
first on the cover of Rolling Stone.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent years, as Run-DMC's popularity waned and edgier
groups surpassed them, each member went on to other careers. Mizell,
his wife, Terri, and their children lived in a middle-class
neighborhood in Queens, and the DJ shifted from performing to acting
mostly as a scout for new talent. He also founded the Scratch D.J.
Academy in Manhattan, where students learned his techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the church, Simmons, who became a minister and also settled
in Queens with his wife and five children, told the burgeoning crowd
that the thousands of mourners illustrated how loved Mizell remained:
"This is his latest hit and the one we'll all remember."</TE>
<TE>   Later, McDaniel, his voice breaking, said "Jam Master Jay was not
a thug. Jam Master Jay was not a gangster. Jay was a creative
individual ... he was the personification, the embodiment of
hip-hop." Then, with his arm around Simmons and a fist in the air, he
did a rap from the group's hit "Jam Master Jay," that ended with
everyone in the church shouting out his name.</TE>
<TE>   Rev. Flake alluded to how the death was a tragedy on many levels
-- a family lost its father, a culture lost its icon, and despite an
upbeat message and a campaign against thuggery, Mizell still lost his
life when someone aimed a gun at his temple.</TE>
<TE>   Flake asked the 2,400 people in the church to stand and vow "not
to participate in acts of violence." In unison, the crowd recited, "I
make a vow that I will value life."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to eulogies by friends and family, including a cousin
who is a minister in North Carolina who told funny stories about
Mizell's relentless enthusiasm and loyalty to his family, the funeral
included much traditional music. Gospel star Donnie McClurkin sang
several standards, and a local artist named Sparkle sang a rendition
of "Amazing Grace" that brought tears to the eyes of even the archest
young rappers in their black leather suits, heavy gold chains and
unlaced sneakers.</TE>

<DH>I Don't Know How She Does It: The Life of Kate Reddy,
Working Mother: A Novel; By Allison Pearson; Alfred A. Knopf: 344
pages, $23</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bernadette Murphy</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kate Reddy is a high-powered London hedge fund manager, a go-getter
from the get-go, traveling for business -- New York today, Germany
tomorrow -- working every vacation, as well as most evenings and
weekends. Kate is also the mother of two small children, and therein
lies the rub. In trying to reconcile Kate's two lives -- financial
maverick by day, devoted mom in whatever scraps of leftover time she
can scrounge up -- author and London journalist Allison Pearson finds
the crux of her skillful and witty first novel, "I Don't Know How She
Does It."</LD>
<LD>   Using the in-your-face female British humor made popular by Helen
Fielding's "Bridget Jones's Diary," Pearson offers caustic insight
into the plight of working mothers. Humor, though, is a dicey game
when kids are at stake, and Kate's initial actions regarding her
children are so maddening that one wishes to grab the rolling pin
from her hands and pummel some sense into her. It's one thing to be
ironic and scathingly funny about a character's misadventures when
only the character suffers the consequences, but with Kate Reddy's
tale, we're forever reminded of the children at home.</LD>
<TE>   Her infant son, Ben, keeps waking in the middle of the night for
his mother's attentions because that's the only time she's around to
cuddle him. Kate, having spent the least amount of time possible with
her progeny during the holiday season, complains that her children
are even more needy after a dose of their mother's care. "Clearly, my
kids have not grasped the principle of Quality Time," she laments.</TE>
<TE>   When her preschooler gets sick and the nanny can't come, Kate
drops feverish Emily off at the house of a person she's never met, an
acquaintance of an acquaintance. It's not the ideal situation, she
admits, but what is? "Mummy staying at home and laying down her life
for small feet to walk over. Would you do that? Could I do that?"
Kate asks. "You don't know me very well if you think I could do
that."</TE>
<TE>   At stake is society's definition of what constitutes good
mothering and how women who want it all may have to sacrifice that
model. In a scene of her thrashing mince pies to make them look
homemade, Kate fails to recognize that her efforts have more to do
with others' impressions of her and absolutely nothing with her
avowed (but seldom demonstrated) devotion to the children.</TE>
<TE>   It's a risky move on Pearson's part, creating a narrator that's
initially so unlikable and blind to her own flaws. Kate grumbles
about her way-too-busy life yet refuses to consider any alternative.
"Can't see how I can go on like this. Can't see how to stop, either."
Regularly, she protests that her husband is not as helpful as she'd
like, and then she rails at him when he tries. She gripes about being
discriminated against at work, whines about the nanny's lack of
dedication and is forever grumbling about those needy children of
hers. Admittedly, her complaining is wickedly funny, but the
underlying reality keeps the story from being taken lightly.</TE>
<TE>   Although sexism feeds her predicament -- women cannot have it all,
thanks to society's prejudice, Kate would argue -- it's hard to
imagine a male character as arrogant and egotistical as Kate still
being lauded as an example of fine parenting.</TE>
<TE>   Pearson, to her everlasting credit, does a skillful job of
transforming Kate; she gradually becomes, if not completely likable,
then at least understandable, someone for whom we feel compassion.</TE>
<TE>   The writing is sharp and witty, erudite and yet down-to-earth, as
Pearson artfully delineates Kate's opposing home and business lives.
Tensions simmer in the workplace between employers and working
mothers. The women are resentful of their jobs for taking them away
from their children and of their children for standing in their
career paths. Animosity brews between stay-at-home mothers and their
working counterparts, each of whom must vilify the other to make
one's difficult choice seem the best choice.</TE>
<TE>   Pearson narrates these strains with a nod to the social fabric
that has made this reality so, leaving the reader with an acerbic
take on the hectic lives we live and the choices we continue to make
to ensure that they remain just as frenzied.</TE>

<LD>A reverie about beautiful women and the seductiveness of the movies,
Brian De Palma's exuberant, blissfully entertaining new thriller
"Femme Fatale" stars Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as a thief who steals $10
million in jewels before taking off with another woman's identity.
Set in Cannes and Paris, the film has the high-buffed gloss and
high-octane jolts you expect of De Palma, but what makes it
transporting is that it's also one of the smartest, most pleasurable
expressions of pure movie love to come from an American director in
years. It's the 24th feature De Palma has directed -- as well as the
first of his films he's written in a decade -- but it feels and plays
like the work of an artist newly born.</LD>
<LD>   The story opens at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival where the thief
is part of an audacious robbery. Dressed as a press photographer,
Laure has lured the woman wearing the jewels (Rie Rasmussen, a
fashion model with switchblade hips) into a ladies room stall for a
scandalously sexy version of strip poker. (Each nuzzle elicits a
karat.) Then a gun is fired and Laure turns on one of her partners in
crime, a dapper villain (Eriq Ebouaney) whom she coolly neutralizes
with the butt of his own gun. Minutes later, she is strutting the red
carpet to freedom, as if she were catwalking for the latest Gaultier
show, another De Palma woman on the loose and the prowl.</LD>
<TE>   Like Hitchcock, De Palma has a thing for blonds, the classic
embodiment of Hollywood's sexual Holy Grail, and he's borrowed the
master's kink for masquerading women. The next time we see Laure
after the jewel heist, she's wearing a brunet wig and standing
outside a Parisian cathedral. What happens next is outlandish,
outrageous. A former paparazzi (Antonio Banderas) whips out a camera
and snaps her picture, forcing Laure into a church where she's
mistaken for a missing woman named Lily. From there, Laure is
catapulted down a rabbit hole of logic that finds her assuming the
missing woman's identity, a switch that brings an extended idyll with
a fairy-book husband (Peter Coyote), then the sort of third-act
comeuppance we expect in movies about women gone wrong.</TE>
<TE>   There's more, much more -- a cynical cop, a plunge in the Seine,
an overflowing barrel of red herrings -- but to spell out the plot of
"Femme Fatale" in detail would be to drain it of its greatest
triumph: the ability to surprise. De Palma has always shocked us with
sex and violence, but after creating the template for the modern
thriller with "Dressed to Kill," a titillating fantasia of
psychological pulp and predatory camera moves that brought
Hitchcock-style suspense into the slasher era, he seemed unsure of
where to go next. He stumbled badly with his crude Hollywood satire
"Body Double," a botched reductio ad absurdum about movies and
sexualized violence that, with its leering hostility toward women and
cartoon atrocities, only proved that even smart guys can't always
keep a handle on their fixations.</TE>
<TE>   Freed from the constraints of censorship that kept Hitchcock's
obsessions sublimated, De Palma doesn't need to obscure his
fascination with sex and violence under the cloak of art or
propriety. He can be vulgar about his likes and dislikes, especially
when it comes to women, and I haven't always liked the female
characters in his films or what he's done with them. The disreputable
aspect of his enthusiasms gives his work juice, but these same
preoccupations have also led him astray, especially in stories where
the frenzy of sex, the frenzy of violence and the frenzy brought on
by so much female pulchritude have seemed interchangeable</TE>
<TE>   To an extent, "Femme Fatale" serves as a corrective to "Body
Double," particularly in terms of its spellbinding lead. A fashion
model and men's magazine fetish, Romijn-Stamos has had her biggest
screen roles to date in the comic-book fantasy "The X-Men," where she
prowled about in little more than blue paint, and the action dud
"Rollerball." She seems like an unlikely femme fatale, but not since
Sissy Spacek burned up the screen in "Carrie" has a De Palma woman
held the screen as forcefully as Romijn-Stamos, an Amazon blond
straight from Helmut Newton's portfolio. In the age of the incredibly
shrinking, professionally demure American female actress, there are
few women who can hold the screen as Romijn-Stamos does, with her cat
eyes and lustily confident physicality. It's no wonder that the first
time we see her she's watching Barbara Stanwyck zap it to Fred
MacMurray in Billy Wilder's "Double Indemnity."</TE>
<TE>   For all the unease about De Palma's women, there's no denying
that, unlike many of his New Hollywood peers, he also makes movies in
which they're more than afterthoughts. His debt to Hitchcock isn't
just a matter of camera moves and Bernard Herrmann-like swells;
rather, it springs from a shared obsessions -- with women, with
seeing the forbidden, with the double helix of fear and desire. As
with Hitchcock, he loves to watch and especially loves to watch
women, and with Romijn-Stamos he's found a woman who can stand up to
his scrutiny. The compulsion to watch is why De Palma keeps returning
to "Vertigo" and "Rear Window," and it accounts for the very quality
of his bristling style -- the propulsive camerawork, the ostentatious
cutting, even the way he grabs our attention as if he were grabbing
our throats, trying to force us to see what he sees. "Femme Fatale"
is all about looking. It's about noticing everything in the frame and
understanding how movies make meaning with images, and not only plot
and dialogue. There isn't a single wasted or empty shot in the film;
everything counts. "Femme Fatale" doesn't have culture or politics on
its feverish mind, but it would be a mistake to underplay how smart
it is or to think that it isn't slipping us ideas in between all that
technique.</TE>
<TE>   Here, the message is the moviemaking and the unparalleled joy you
get from a film that can carry you off so completely, making you
forget about everything save for the beautiful lies in front of you.</TE>

<LD>"I believe that all people who stand to profit from a war should be
shot on the first day of it," said the actor, drawing thunderous
applause from the crowd. The material? Not an exhortation against
invading Iraq but "The World of Nick Adams," a play based on
Hemingway short stories, set in 1915.</LD>
<LD>   Jack Nicholson led the players as the narrator Hemingway and was
surrounded by a "Who's Who in Hollywood" cast: Matt Damon as the
19-year-old Adams who encounters some eccentric characters running
away from Mom and his small-town roots; Julia Roberts and Annette
Bening as bickering floozies; Gary Sinise and Danny DeVito as Little
League thugs; Bruce Willis as a world-weary boxer.</LD>
<LD>   Joining them were Tom Hanks, Kevin Kline, Brian Dennehy, Danny
Glover, Edward James Olmos, Chris O'Donnell, Warren Beatty, Mena
Suvari and Goldie Hawn -- and Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, who
organized the Monday night fund-raiser held at a sold-out Kodak
Theatre in Hollywood. Many of the actors had performed the piece last
November at New York's Lincoln Center.</LD>
<TE>   It was not a full-scale play, but a staged reading, in which the
actors sat behind music stands and walked around with scripts.
Thirty-two members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, led by associate
conductor Miguel Harth-Bedoya, performed incidental music composed by
Aaron Copland, an admirer of Hemingway's.</TE>
<TE>   "When do you ever see a group like this in one place -- it's like
an Academy Award event," said audience member Shirley Arconti of
Beverly Hills. "Of course, I would have come just to hear Paul Newman
read the phone book."</TE>
<TE>   What brought them together was the Painted Turtle, the latest of
Newman's Hole in the Wall Gang Camps for seriously ill children.
Located in Lake Hughes, an hour north of Los Angeles, it aims to open
next year. Ticket sales, ranging from $40 to $500 for general seating
and up to $2,500 for VIPs, will help.</TE>
<TE>   It was Hemingway biographer and Newman business partner A.E.
Hotchner who came up with the notion of turning a CBS teleplay he
adapted in 1957 into a concert work. And, coming full circle, Newman
played the same punch-drunk fighter he tackled in "The Battler," a
1956 Nick Adams tale that aired on NBC, leading to the actor's first
successful movie, "Somebody Up There Likes Me."</TE>
<TE>   "Staged readings are usually done in someone's apartment, a room
of 20 people -- often to get backing," said Jean Picker Firstenberg,
chief executive of the American Film Institute. "It's not easy to
make them work in a [3,500-seat] theater like this. In any case,
people will be very forgiving because the actors are donating their
time. And because Newman and Woodward are artists committed to
something beyond themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Davidson, artistic director of the Mark Taper Forum and
Ahmanson Theatre, directed the Lou Adler-produced show when Arvin
Brown, the former artistic director of New Haven's Long Wharf
Theatre, bowed out. With only a few hours for the actors to rehearse,
he professed to be quite happy with the production.</TE>
<TE>   "There are always things I'd change," he said. "Coulda fixed this,
coulda fixed that -- but those are insignificant. Though Nicholson
hasn't done a lot of stage work, he's smart, you know his mind is
alive and working. He's also a wonderful listener and half of acting
is listening."</TE>
<TE>   Suvari ("American Pie," "Sonny") admitted to "being in awe" of her
high-profile colleagues and "terrified" of her first time on stage.
Kline, she says, provided some hints on translating her feelings to
the medium.</TE>
<TE>   If she was unnerved by the lack of preparation time, DeVito
dismissed the problem. "Many of us hadn't been on 'the boards' in
awhile," he said, giving a British intonation to the term. "But,
don't forget, we had the book. We New Jersey guys can read."</TE>
<TE>   Autographing the shirt of a Hole in the Wall Gang camper ("the
real star") at the after-party, Hanks acknowledged some sleepless
nights. Would the audience connect with such a scaled-back
production? The broad accent required of his character, an Italian
army officer, was less of a worry: "DeVito coached me backstage," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lest anyone be diverted from the real thrust of the night, the
event was framed by the Hole in the Wall Gang. A video, featuring an
adolescent cancer patient, began the program. The same remarkably
poised youngster spoke at the end of the show, on the heels of the
prolonged standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Carole King, a longtime supporter of the project, led a chorus of
campers in "Hope," a song with lyrics by Hotchner for which she wrote
the music. "It's a remarkable bunch of performers, but it's always
about the kids."</TE>

<LD>The cat's in heat again, meowing and rolling around like Anna Nicole
Smith. My wife is menopausal-pregnant. The kids are entering
Christmas mode. "Fatherhood is for good," the sign on the bus stop
warns. Of all things, you think to yourself.</LD>
<LD>   "Here, help me out of this chair," says my pregnant bride.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm having a good hair week," announces the little girl.</LD>
<TE>   "Can I have 20 bucks?" the boy asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Meow," screams the sex-crazed cat. "And I mean it."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, it's like I'm living a children's book, only there are
adults in it with real adult problems. Marriage issues. Money
problems. And that's just at our house. Lord knows what's going on
next door.</TE>
<TE>   Take my wife. No, seriously, take her. Lovely as a summer rose,
she's menopausal one moment and pregnant the next. Makes for an
interesting outlook on life.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you," she says, "have any idea how old we'll be when this baby
goes to college?"</TE>
<TE>   "Too old to have another one?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   She looks at me with executioner's eyes. Sizing me up for a noose.</TE>
<TE>   "Too old to remarry?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   See, I try to find the humor in this situation. I try to find the
joy. There is a blessing in this late-in-life pregnancy if you just
look hard enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad, did you really call Mom 'Jiffy Pop?' " the boy asks.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just her rapper name," I explain.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think she likes her rapper name," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Sensitive, these people I live with. Some are menopausal and
pregnant. Others are merely teenagers. Same symptoms: cranky,
beautiful, borderline insane.</TE>
<TE>   In the other room, the phone rings. It's college calling.</TE>
<TE>   "Know what I was thinking?" the college student says. "It's
completely selfish, but that's OK."</TE>
<TE>   Evidently, my college daughter has lots to tell me, for she is
speaking faster than the speed of sound. Above the house, there are
occasional sonic booms. Windows rattle. Plaster cracks. Under the
house, termites burrow into the floor joists, fearing the worst.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're busy raising your baby, how will Mom ever be able to
help when I have one?" she says.</TE>
<TE>   Fatherhood is for good? Now they tell me.</TE>
<TE>   And on to the couples' baby shower we go, the one I mentioned last
week, at the big house in the hills.</TE>
<TE>   "What's this guy do?" a friend asks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's in the mob," I say.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, he works in movies and he's married to the leggy
dentist. Some years, she might make more than he does. Had a crown
put on lately, you know what I'm saying.</TE>
<TE>   "This place is so beautiful," Nancy says.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's the bar?" asks Hank.</TE>
<TE>   They party well here in the suburbs. Wine flows. Plates of food
orbit the guests. One friend pinches me every time he passes.
Pretends it's an accident.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe you're having another kid," Susy says.</TE>
<TE>   "We are?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   "See, she's completely pregnant," Janet says.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, there's always room for one more," I explain.</TE>
<TE>   Wait, no there isn't. I can barely handle the kids I already have,
though I have no major complaints about them. They're good kids. I
wouldn't change a thing.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, they're chronically unemployed, with a Kennedy's sense of
entitlement. But I love them dearly. I guess it's sort of a Stockholm
syndrome: I've fallen for my captors.</TE>
<TE>   "Do we know what sex the baby is?" someone asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Doesn't matter," I say.</TE>
<TE>   In another room, the women are opening gifts. "Ooooooooo," says my
wife with every new box.</TE>
<TE>   "Ahhhhhhhh," say the other wives, lovely as aging Bond girls,
chardonnay on their middle-aged lips.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, I don't recognize hardly any of these baby items,
though I am grateful for every last one of them, whatever they are.</TE>
<TE>   The one gift I recognize is a gag gift from Julie and Steve, a
Sigmund Freud action figure. As you might guess, he's holding a
cigar.</TE>
<TE>   On the box are some quotes from Freud, who apparently lived in the
suburbs as well. Did a bunch of research here. Might've played a
little golf.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite my 30 years of research into the feminine soul, I have
not yet been able to answer ... the great question that has never
been answered: What does a woman want?"</TE>
<TE>   Children, some of them. Don't say you weren't warned.</TE>

<HD>'Cherry Orchard's' subtlety lost amid cast's hyperactive
antics</HD>
<DH>A Noise Within's production of the Chekhov classic, which
seems misguided by its director, suffers from a lack of emotional
sincerity and wit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. Kathleen Foley</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the common wisdom, Chekhov's plays are comedies. And indeed they
are -- fragile but durable stuff that, given just the right handling,
can be subtly hilarious.</LD>
<LD>   In the current staging of "The Cherry Orchard" at A Noise Within,
director Adrian Giurgea takes a trowel to Chekhov, shoveling artifice
onto a magnificently structured play (translated here by Paul
Schmidt) that cries out for emotional sincerity and wit.</LD>
<LD>   Deborah Strang plays Lyubov Ranevskaya, the Russian aristocrat
who, along with her feckless brother Leonid Gayev (Robertson Dean),
has mismanaged the family estate right onto the auction block. A
luminous and able actress, Strang almost salvages her character from
the weight of twitching mannerisms that Giurgea imposes. Almost, but
not quite.</LD>
<TE>   At the top of the play, Strang and her entourage, including her
daughter Anya (bland Maria Bergman), who are returning home after a
long sojourn in Europe, caper onto the stage like horses released
from a chute, wild-eyed and prancing.</TE>
<TE>   That antic, falsely energetic tone persists for much of the play.
Even Varya (Ann Marie Lee), a mousy hausfrau with an unrequited crush
on the wealthy peasant Lopakhin (Daniel Reichert), romps like a
schoolgirl as she goes about her daily rounds. With few exceptions,
the actors appear to have been directed to always run, never walk --
or worse, amble. With nary a hint of Chekhovian languor, these
characters comport themselves like moths in a candle flame, when they
should more properly be flies taking a last lap in the congealing
amber.</TE>
<TE>   The play opens in the house's nursery -- a room dominated by an
enormous white dollhouse in Danila Korogodsky's otherwise stark set.
That set piece is emblematic of Giurgea's dominant theme -- that
these aristocrats are desperate children, weighed down by centuries
of privilege, treading water in the rising tide of mercantilism and
social change. Certainly, on the surface at least, that tack would
seem appropriate to Chekhov's prevalent view of the Russian
aristocracy as extravagant and colorful relics of a vanishing order.</TE>
<TE>   But by relentlessly infantilizing the characters -- particularly
the women, who gasp and quiver with unvaryingly histrionic intensity
-- Giurgea idiot-proofs Chekhov's intentions to an unnecessary
degree, bludgeoning home every symbol and meaning and plot point with
a heavy hand. Instead of trusting his audience and Chekhov's gentle,
rhythmic humor, Giurgea simply amps up the pacing on his energetic
but trying interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   A workmanlike cast struggles valiantly to keep the action flowing,
with some success. Although he is slightly miscast, Reichert is a
dynamic Lopakhin, until Giurgea lures him into foot-stomping excess.
And Ken Grantham, who plays Boris Semyonov-Pishchik, gives a
delightfully authentic performance in defiance of the prevalent
artificiality.</TE>

<HD>A new hill to climb</HD>
<DH>Stephen D. Rountree, chosen to head the Music Center just
as Disney Hall is nearing completion, looks forward to the
considerable challenges before him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Haithman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Tuesday morning, Stephen D. Rountree gamely posed for pictures and
sat down at a sunny cafe table alongside the fountain on the Music
Center plaza for his first interview as president of the downtown
performing arts complex.</LD>
<LD>   But the conversation had to take place early: Rountree, an affable
53-year-old Pasadena native, was on his way to a morning meeting in a
trailer.</LD>
<LD>   Though brand new to the president's role -- the Music Center board
elected him unanimously Monday afternoon; he formally starts on Nov.
18 -- Rountree has spent the last 3 1/2 years as part of the
volunteer oversight committee for the Music Center's newest
performing arts venue: Walt Disney Concert Hall. Once a week, he and
a board of community and artistic leaders have been meeting in a
trailer near the construction site to discuss fundraising and other
issues.</LD>
<TE>   It is those unglamorous trailer talks about Disney Hall that
bonded Rountree and the Music Center leadership. But it is his
involvement with another new Los Angeles landmark that landed him his
challenging new job. In his current post as executive vice president
and chief operating officer of the J. Paul Getty Trust, Rountree, a
22-year Getty veteran, played a major role in overseeing the 1997
opening of the billion-dollar Getty Center in Brentwood.</TE>
<TE>   The search for a new president began in April, when Joanne Kozberg
announced her resignation effective as soon as a replacement could be
found.</TE>
<TE>   "In the process of that search, I met with 18 or 19 board members,
as well as other center representatives," Rountree said. "There
seemed to be a strong emphasis on the need for management and
efficient organizing, in order to get the concert hall opened in an
efficient way."</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the Music Center directors thought they wanted
Kozberg's replacement to play an impresario's role in bringing new
programming to the performing arts complex.</TE>
<TE>   That demand will become much greater as the Los Angeles
Philharmonic and the Los Angeles Master Chorale -- two of the
center's four resident companies along with Los Angeles Opera and
Center Theater Group -- make their September move into the new Walt
Disney Concert Hall, leaving more dark time at their current home,
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   But soon, says Rountree, it was decided that "the impresario role
was too narrow for the president," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, when he starts in a week and a half, one of Rountree's
immediate tasks will be to hire a programming executive -- a first
for the center -- to handle the new artistic challenges.</TE>
<TE>   And, although Rountree plans to leave most programming duties to a
new executive, he doesn't mind expressing a few of his hopes for
Disney Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still a significant number of nights not taken by the
Phil or the Master Chorale, particularly in the summer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We will have some fantastic opportunities. The hall is designed
for performance involving acoustic music, not amplified electronic
music, but I'm going out on a limb here; I don't see why we couldn't
present an Eric Clapton or even an Alanis Morissette.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to reach out for this kind of music. And even though the
Chandler will be the primary venue for dance, there are certain kinds
of contemporary dance that might benefit from Disney Hall's more
intimate space."</TE>
<TE>   Rountree also wants the Music Center to use Disney Hall as a
magnet to make the Music Center more user-friendly, even during the
day -- perhaps providing audio tours and brochures to those
interested in the hall as mainly as architecture, in hopes of luring
them back to sample the performance offerings at the center. Its
restaurants will be open during the day, available to jurors at
nearby courthouses, who will use the concert hall's parking lots.</TE>
<TE>   "Frank Gehry calls it the city's living room, and that's how I see
it, too," he said. The opening of Disney Hall, he said, is "an
opportunity to welcome the public, to use its visibility as an
opportunity to promote the whole Music Center and reintroduce all the
resident companies."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to the resident companies, Rountree sees himself as
a facilitator in creating a more "collegial climate" among
organizations that often compete for funding from the same pool of
arts-minded donors.</TE>
<TE>   "I've observed a level of competitiveness between the resident
companies that is no secret," he said. "I think the board was
attracted to me not just by my ability to open buildings but by my
ability to create transparent, positive, collegial relationships."</TE>
<TE>   Rountree has plans for the Music Center's education programs as
well; he hopes they will include more youth-oriented performances,
not just in the theaters but also on the plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Chairman Van de Kamp called Rountree a natural fit for the
president's role.</TE>
<TE>   "We realized we were in a different position than we originally
thought; working out the enormous details of a major opening seemed
to be -- let me just tactfully say -- overwhelming," she said. "We
definitely needed to have, as our foremost and primary concern,
someone who knew how to set up a staff and open a facility. Clearly
Steve Rountree has that, having done it at the Getty and having
gotten extremely high marks from some very tough graders on that."</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Borda, managing director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic,
agreed. "Really, this is a momentous occasion, the opening of what
could be one of the great concert halls of the 21st century," she
said. "I think Steve's experience in opening an international
destination such as the Getty puts him in a special position to get
us over the top."</TE>
<TE>   Rountree, however, also puts an emphasis on the center as a whole:
"We want audiences to take the chance, to see performances they might
not otherwise see. That's the dream here; it's possible to realize
it."</TE>

<LD>"Doo-wah, doo-wah, DOO-WAH!" The voices of 19 teenagers of varying
ages, sizes and shapes fill the Buckley School gymnasium theater in
Sherman Oaks, blending like a 1950s Teen Angel dream, rising in a
crescendo of pitch-perfect multiples of four-part harmony.</LD>
<LD>   Born long after the "Heart and Soul" generation, the young
performers, stretching in chorus line fashion across a small
proscenium stage, are finding a euphoric high in singing pop hits of
the past.</LD>
<LD>   The sandy-haired, smiling, amiably disheveled reason is seated in
front of them: Stuart Ross, creator of "Forever Plaid," the
phenomenally successful musical about a 1950s-'60s tight-harmony
quartet's return from the dead for the one big gig they missed in
life.</LD>
<TE>   Ross, commuting from New York, is working with Buckley's students,
dance director Laura Bamford, choral director John Hendricks, pianist
Chris Hardin and theater director Neil Nash -- a former "Plaid"
himself -- to craft the template for an expanded version of his show
for high school use. For this version, "Plaid's" original male
quartet becomes a co-ed student glee club with a Perry Como-Rosemary
Clooney "sing-off."</TE>
<TE>   At this day's rehearsal, Ross is round-eyed with surprise when
13-year-old Zach Spound belts out "Cry," and Danielle Levine, 17,
pulls off one of Ross' riskiest innovations--a female take on the
bass lead vocal in "Sixteen Tons." When Levine's big, melodic low
notes fill the room, ending on a wickedly spot-on operatic finish, "I
thought I was going to pass out," Ross says. "I knew it would work if
a girl sang it."</TE>
<TE>   If successful -- public performances will premiere at the school
Thursday through Nov. 16 -- Ross' new "Sounds of Plaid" will join the
long roster of student versions of Broadway shows that are made
available to high schools across the country, from "Annie" to "Les
Miserables," by New York-based dramatic licensing agency Music
Theatre International.</TE>
<TE>   The agency, which also tailors shows for its "Broadway Junior"
program for elementary and middle schools, licenses 8,000 to 9,000
high school productions each year. Costs to schools range from $450
per license for lower grades to $1,500 for high schools.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very big part of our business," says agency owner and
chairman Freddie Gershon, who suggests that a Broadway show
experience for students can be to theater what Little League is to
sports.</TE>
<TE>   Participation, not creating "the next little Bernadette Peters,"
he says, is his agency's goal. "By immersing yourself in the fun of
putting on a show, you're learning to work as a community. You don't
have to be the star. You can be in the chorus, you can paint a
backdrop, help get the costumes together or work the lights. Everyone
has a job to do, and they're all pulling for one moment, for one
night, to get a bunch of people to rise to their feet at the end of a
two-hour program."</TE>
<TE>   "The premise is that once someone gets into the world of theater,
they will get hooked," Gershon says. "We think of ourselves as
farmers dropping little seeds into the ground, and hopefully,
there'll be a harvest. Maybe in 10 or 15 years, these kids are going
to be the people who go see regional theater productions."</TE>
<TE>   Sparking teenagers' passion for musical theater might seem a
quixotic endeavor, given that what they usually listen to is light
years from yesteryear's Hit Parade.</TE>
<TE>   Ross' experience suggests otherwise. "You have these contemporary
kids saying, 'I want to sing Perry Como, I want to sing "Perfidia." '
And when the [girls] did 'Hey There,' they just went right into it.
It sounds so beautiful," he says. "It's been a great, happy
surprise."</TE>
<TE>The cast members -- some long-limbed and poised on the threshold of
adulthood, others round-faced, lingering on the fringes of childhood
-- had their own happy surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the original "Plaids," David Engel and Larry Raben, who are
appearing in "Forever Plaid" at Performance Riverside, popped in
during the rehearsal, gave the show a thumbs-up and expressed
fellowship with a departing, "Bye, guys, break a leg." The delighted
cast saw them off with loud applause.</TE>

<HD>Just a stone's throw away</HD>
<DH>Intimacy and warmth punctuate the band's memorable show in
a close setting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the years we've become used to seeing Mick Jagger and Keith
Richards snarl, flirt, tease and even play with fire on stage. But
we've rarely seen them double up with laughter.</LD>
<LD>   That incident was one of many warm and revealing moments Monday at
the Wiltern as the Rolling Stones stepped away for the night from
their usual arena and stadium surroundings for the intimacy of a
2,200-capacity theater.</LD>
<LD>   The result was every bit as memorable as the high expectations
surrounding the show. Though general admission tickets were priced at
just $50, many fans on the main floor reported paying brokers and
scalpers up to $1,500 -- and they felt lucky to have gotten them.</LD>
<TE>   In the vastness of larger settings, such as Staples Center on
Thursday, the Stones sometimes seem as coolly disciplined as actors
in a play. The music is still thrilling, but there's little hint of
the spontaneous interaction that gives rock 'n' roll a special spark.</TE>
<TE>   At the Wiltern, however, the Stones became flesh-and-blood
musicians again -- and those fans on the main floor were so close to
the action that they too felt as if they were on stage. It was
fascinating to watch the band members gesturing and talking to each
other as they reintroduced themselves to some relatively obscure
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the two-hour-plus set, guitarist Richards and drummer
Charlie Watts huddled as they worked on their timing on 1969's
zestful "Live With Me."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Jagger motioned for the band to play more softly on the
"That's How Strong My Love Is," an R&amp;B ballad from 1965's "Out of Our
Heads" album.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing, however, personalized the night as much as soul singer
Solomon Burke joining the group to perform "Everybody Needs Somebody
to Love," one of two Burke hits the Stones recorded in the mid-'60s.</TE>
<TE>   Burke, who was also the evening's opening act and is widely
considered one of the greatest R&amp;B singers ever, has long billed
himself as the "king of rock and soul" and he has often worn a cape
and jeweled crown on stage as a visual exclamation point.</TE>
<TE>   As the slender Jagger and the nearly 500-pound Burke traded vocal
lines and a few hip-swinging moves, a member of Burke's band suddenly
raced across the stage with Burke's cape and threw it around Jagger's
shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   It was a sweet gesture, clearly orchestrated by Burke -- a nod
from a teacher to a pupil that he underscored with his toast to
Jagger: "To the true king of rock 'n' roll."</TE>
<TE>   Flustered, Jagger pulled the cape from his shoulders and tried to
return the compliment by giving it to Burke. But the soul man headed
off stage before Jagger could reach him in the crowd of musicians.</TE>
<TE>   Jagger and Richards, whose relationship over the years has
sometimes been thorny, came together and laughed so hard at the image
of Jagger struggling to get out from under the massive cape that they
almost had to hold each other up.</TE>
<TE>   "It's big enough to cover three of us," Richards wisecracked.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by Burke's singing and playfulness, Jagger seemed to
revert back to the club days in Britain when he was still as much a
fan as a musician. He channeled that energy and innocence into a
show-stopping rendition of "That's How Strong My Love Is."</TE>
<TE>   In that and other moments Monday, we got an invaluable look at the
band playing with unrivaled passion and vulnerability -- just as they
did when the idea of performing with their heroes or headlining in
America was still just a dream away.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The set list</TE>
<TE>   Wrapping up a three-show Southern California run Monday at the
Wiltern, the Rolling Stones continued to slip some surprises into
their set list. The show's lineup:</TE>
<TE>   "Jumpin' Jack Flash"</TE>
<TE>   "Live With Me"</TE>
<TE>   "Neighbors"</TE>
<TE>   "Hand of Fate"</TE>

<LD>Thursday, June 4, 1767. Last Saturday evening died at his house in
this city, Mr. William Waters; he was a Gentleman universally
respected for his amiable disposition which makes his death justly
regretted.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   This obituary (death notice) appeared 235 years ago in the Purdie
and Dixon edition of the Virginia Gazette, but who was William Waters
and how can we find out more about him and his family?</LD>
<TE>   Like all good mysteries, there are a few clues: a desk, a broken
teacup and a portrait of a young woman. How are these items related?
To whom did they belong?</TE>
<TE>   The November Colonial Williamsburg Electronic Field Trip, "The
Case of the Shuttered Room," follows two young history sleuths, Tyler
and Joe, as they attempt to unravel the mystery behind this story.</TE>
<TE>   Each new piece of information leads to a better understanding of
how people in that time lived. The goal of the mystery is to unlock
and open the "shuttered room" so we can better understand the past.</TE>
<TE>   To learn more and help solve the mystery, tune in to the Colonial
Williamsburg Electronic Field Trip, "The Case of the Shuttered Room,"
on KLCS-TV from 10 to 11 a.m. Thursday. This live multimedia program,
designed for students in grades 4 through 8, brings history to life
in the classroom.</TE>

<HD>In pursuit of Steve McQueen</HD>
<DH>Fans say the minimalist but magnetic actor, getting his
first major L.A. retrospective, has imitators but no equals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I live for myself and I answer to nobody."</LD>
<LD>   "When I believe in something, I fight like hell for it."</LD>
<LD>   "I worked hard, and if you work hard you get the goodies."</LD>
<TE>   -- Steve McQueen</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lean, sexy, tough and wild, Steve McQueen drove fast cars and
motorcycles and lived life on the edge. His acting style was
magnificently minimal -- even his appearance was pared down with his
buzz-cut hair, jeans, turtlenecks and denim shirts and jackets.</TE>
<TE>   "He was like one of the beautiful sports cars he loved to race,"
says Dennis Bartok, programming manager for the American
Cinematheque. "He had this beautiful exterior and this massive 440 cc
engine under the hood, and when you hit the gas it was going to go,
go, go."</TE>
<TE>   So it's surprising that despite McQueen's popularity -- which
seems, if anything, to grow over the years -- there has never been a
major retrospective of the actor's work in Los Angeles. Beginning
Thursday, the 22nd anniversary of his death at the age of 50 from
complications due to cancer, the Cinematheque is celebrating his
remarkable career with the four-day retrospective "Low Rider: The
Super-Charged Cinema of Steve McQueen."</TE>
<TE>   The festival opens with "The Great Escape," the 1963 World War II
epic that made him a superstar, and continues with two of his hits
from 1968, the thrilling detective flick "Bullitt" and the
sophisticated "The Thomas Crown Affair"; the 1973 epic "Papillon," in
which he gives one of his best and most underrated performance as
French convict Henri "Papillon" Charriere; the two 1972 films he made
with director Sam Peckinpah, "The Getaway" and the lovely character
study "Junior Bonner"; the seminal 1960 western "The Magnificent
Seven"; the Norman Jewison-directed 1965 drama "The Cincinnati Kid,"
in which he played an ambitious gambler; and Don Siegel's sparse 1962
war drama, "Hell Is for Heroes."</TE>
<TE>   "He was maybe not the greatest actor who ever appeared in movies,
but he had a charisma and a magnetism about him that registered so
powerfully on the screen," says Rick Jewell, associate dean of USC's
School of Cinema-Television. "When you think about his career, his
big breakthrough films are 'Magnificent Seven' and 'The Great
Escape.' They are both ensemble films in which he's working with a
number of very strong, in fact, powerful actors, and yet what you
remember from those films more than anything else are the characters
that he played in the film. Somehow he just leaped off the screen."</TE>
<TE>   McQueen, says Jewell, instinctively knew the way "for him to go
was to underplay. Yet there was this kind of extraordinary energy
that emanated out from him the camera recognized.... . He was like
Garbo. He didn't have to do anything. He just had to be there and
embody those characters."</TE>
<TE>   Though many actors have aspired to be the next McQueen, no one has
been able to fill his shoes. "He became a model for 'I want to be
like....' " says his former producing partner and friend, Bob Relyea.
"I have seen so many attempts to imitate him, but they don't work
well. You can't just go and have that look and have that posture and
cut down the words that you use and have the same results."</TE>
<TE>   McQueen, says Bartok, has become the "archetype for a certain
style of American male actor. You can see it in a lot of younger
actors, like Paul Walker for example. Everybody says that about Matt
Damon -- you can see certain McQueenisms in his performance."</TE>
<TE>   Bartok points out a perfect McQueen moment in "Papillon" in which
his character is being transported with other prisons to the penal
colony. "A couple of the other prisoners are talking about how bad it
is," relates Bartok. "McQueen is just listening and it's a beautiful
kind of case study of what makes a star. For any other star, the
McQueen character would be the one asking the questions, but McQueen
is different. He doesn't need dialogue, but your eyes are on him the
whole time."</TE>

<TE>   and John Shanks,</TE>
<TE>   from the song</TE>
<TE>   "Steve McQueen C'Mon, C'Mon"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   McQueen was the quintessential street kid who made good. Born in
1930 in Slater, Mo., he was abandoned as a child by his father and as
a teenager spent time in a boys reform school in Chino. When he
became a star, he continued to send clothes and money to the school.
He spent time in the Marines during the late '40s and worked as a
lumberjack, bartender, carnival barker and TV repairman before
joining the Neighborhood Playhouse in 1952 to study acting. He worked
in live television early in his career, most notably playing a young
man on trial for murder in Reginald Rose's drama "The Defender."</TE>
<TE>   In 1958, he starred in the cult classic sci-fi flick "The Blob"
and landed the role of a bounty hunter in the TV western series
"Wanted: Dead or Alive." More movie roles followed in the late '50s.
It was "The Magnificent Seven" (1960), in which he played a hired
gun, that transformed him into a star.</TE>
<TE>   He received his one and only Oscar nomination for his touching
role as a engineer working on an American gunboat in 1920s China in
Robert Wise's 1966 film "The Sand Pebbles." After "The Towering
Inferno" in 1974, McQueen stayed off the screen for several years,
returning in the late '70s in the ill-fated "An Enemy of the People,"
based on Henrik Ibsen's play, and two poorly received films, "Tom
Horn" and "The Hunter," which were released a few months prior to his
death in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone admires McQueen's style. Film critic Richard Schickel
admits he is not a big fan: "He got more minimalist [during his
career] so by the time he was doing 'Sand Pebbles' it was like,
"Hello, Steve. Are you there?' "</TE>
<TE>   McQueen, Schickel adds, "was sort of a necessary guy in the movies
in the sense that he brought a certain amount of useful '60s kind of
sprit to the movies. He was a cool guy. To me he sometimes projected
too much sort of sullenness and withdrawal, but there was a lot of
withdrawal in younger people at that time."</TE>
<TE>   The actor had a reputation for being very difficult on the set.
Relyea, whose professional and personal association with McQueen
ended after the 1971 film "Le Mans," thought that knock on the actor
was unfair.</TE>
<TE>   "He felt that he knew his craft and had specific ideas about it,"
says Relyea. . "He had his ideas of what he wanted to do ... and he
had some very specific ideas of what kind of holster to use and what
the hat would look like. He had a lot of questions, and he was
prepared and he was professional.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure he had his faults and moods. He had serious moods swings,
but at the same time if I had a personal issue or a problem, he would
be there in case he was needed. You can't say that about a lot of
your friends."</TE>
<TE>   The actor, says Relyea, also believed he was the reincarnation of
Alexander the Great. "It was a little spooky because he resembled the
old statues [of Alexander]. But he really believed it."</TE>
<TE>   Michael T. Marsden, professor of English and cultural studies at
Eastern Kentucky University and co-editor of the Journal of Popular
Film and Television, says if McQueen hadn't died at a relatively
young age, he wouldn't have had the enduring appeal he has accrued
over the decades. "You don't see him in any other way except at his
full powers," says Marsden.</TE>
<TE>   "He is that quintessential male hero and if he were to grow old,
he would lose that. James Dean is always the perpetual teenager-young
adult and McQueen is the perpetual adult male hero. He never got to
be that golden age. He was always captured at the peak of his power."</TE>

<HD>6th trip down the aisle for 'The Kid'</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>"Love is more pleasant than marriage for the same reason that novels
are more amusing than history," author Nicolas Chamfort said.</LD>
<LD>   Love and marriage have both struck on the Left Coast, proving that
"The Kid" is still staying in the picture. Yes, I'm talking about the
indestructible legend, 72-year-old Bob Evans.</LD>
<LD>   His wedlock to the leggy, 34-year-old former Versace model Leslie
Ann Woodward has been rumored more than once of late. But the actual
ceremony didn't take place until last weekend on a beach in Mexico.</LD>
<TE>   Evans has seldom met a woman he didn't charm. And a lot of those
same women he married. This is Woodward's first time at the beach,
which substituted for the altar. She follows a list of lovely past
Mrs. Evanses: Sharon Hugueny, Ali MacGraw, Phyllis George, Camilla
Sparv and Catherine Oxenberg.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Evans has said "I do" five times previously and has,
like Elizabeth Taylor, vowed each time never to wed again -- he's
just a boy who can't say no.</TE>
<TE>   The producer's wedding gifts to his latest bride include sapphire
and diamond earrings, a diamond crucifix and a pearl-and-diamond
necklace.</TE>
<TE>   This wedding was no simple affair. Fifty mariachis on horseback
serenaded. Evans had director Brett Ratner and his son, Josh, as
groomsmen. Among the 30 guests were actor Matthew McConaughey, lawyer
Robert Shapiro and Variety's Peter Bart. Having a hit documentary
out, "The Kid Stays in the Picture," just wasn't enough excitement
for Evans. He had to get married once again.</TE>

<HD>It beats hanging out at the counter of Schwab's</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Want to be an actor, a singer, a model, a writer, a showgirl, a
wrestler or a film director? A national icon of female perfection?
How about president of the United States?</LD>
<LD>   If so, don't waste time screening agents or campaign managers.
Instead, look no further than television.</LD>
<LD>   Blame it on "American Idol" -- and to a lesser degree "Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire" and "Survivor" -- but providing ordinary people
a shot at stardom has become TV's genre-of-the-moment, with shows on,
or being planned, devoted to all of the above.</LD>
<TE>   Given that announcements dribble out one by one it's easy to
ignore the parade, until you step back and fully appreciate the
absurdity of this lemming-like behavior. Even some within the
industry say the deluge of amateur-hour copycats appears ludicrous,
with one producer joking that the only untapped idea would involve
hunting for a TV columnist.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll put you out of business," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but I might not be alone on the scrapheap. Agents,
managers and casting directors have cause to ponder their irrelevance
as well. After all, their job has always been to sift through the
world's wannabes, weeding out no-talents and half-wits before they
appear on national television.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, the process of thinning the herd is itself deemed
ready for prime time -- a game-show approach that lets the audience
decide who makes the cut.</TE>
<TE>   The roster of such shows is almost too long to recite, but a
partial list includes CBS reviving "Star Search," HBO seeking another
fledgling writer-director to torment on "Project Greenlight," and
MTV's "WWE Tough Enough" teaching the ropes to aspiring wrestlers.</TE>
<TE>   Bravo's "The It Factor" returns in January (more than 800 people
lined up at an open casting call to find nine actors), and UPN's
"Supermodel" shouldn't be confused with "Vegas Showgirls" on E!,
which also milked the hunt for a new "Wild On" host for a full six
months.</TE>
<TE>   It seems only a matter of time before the obvious pay-TV
equivalent -- "Casting Couch: Anything for Fame" -- makes its debut
on Showtime, or for that matter Fox.</TE>
<TE>   In the truth-is-stranger-than-fiction department, meanwhile, is
Animal Planet's just-announced "Pet Star" -- essentially a stupid
network trick, auditioning pets with "an unusual talent" -- and the
FX channel's proposed competition to select a presidential candidate
for 2004.</TE>
<TE>   So it's come to this. Americans are apparently too lazy to choose
their political leaders. We need a series on one of Rupert Murdoch's
networks to do it for us. (Come to think of it, FX might be popping
champagne corks right now had producers mounted the show early enough
to enter the victor in California's gubernatorial race.)</TE>
<TE>   Beyond all of this, existing series have introduced talent
searches, again lending truth to comic Fred Allen's line that
imitation is the sincerest form of television.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's "Today" amassed over 4,000 tapes from singers eager to
become "Today's Superstar," while "The Caroline Rhea Show" is
conducting its own showcase this month (it's sweeps, in case you
couldn't tell) under the heading "Now That's Talent," a pretty bold
move for a host with so-so ratings, given the "All About Eve"
scenario that comes to mind. At minimum, the "lucky winner" earns the
right to open for Rhea's stand-up act, plus a Dodge Durango in which
to flee the scene.</TE>
<TE>   The producers of "American Idol," by the way, are hardly in a
position to feign indignation over this attack of the clones, having
brazenly ripped themselves off. Their upcoming projects include ABC's
"Supergirl" -- a sort-of pageant for young women with beauty, brains
and the intestinal fortitude to watch "According to Jim" -- and
"Second Chance," another "Idol" worshipper for Fox, providing pop
has-beens a comeback shot.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, there is a degree of wish fulfillment in all these
programs, feeding the fantasy that anybody can "make it," given the
chance.</TE>
<TE>   Yet while the "A Star Is Born" formula possesses an enduring
rags-to-riches appeal, the real impetus here is less about unearthing
new talent than capitalizing on unknowns hungry to be on TV -- the
perfect raw material for inexpensive programming.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Hollywood regularly demonstrates that luck and notoriety
can be every bit as valuable as talent and hard work, helping keep
the Tonya Hardings and Joey Buttafuocos of the world in the
spotlight, if only to serve as fodder for freakish spectacles like
Fox's "Celebrity Boxing."</TE>
<TE>   And really, how important can talent be when Colleen Haskell and
Colby Donaldson segue directly from "Survivor" into film and TV
roles? The latter appears Friday in "Another Pretty Face," a Pax TV
movie billed as his first dramatic gig, which fails to credit
Donaldson for how well he pretended to be thrilled about losing out
on the big money to Tina Wesson.</TE>
<TE>   In short, TV is not only recycling celebrities but creating future
has-been celebrities faster than you can say Kato Kaelin.</TE>
<TE>   As for those who harbor caviar dreams, these unscripted programs
simply offer another means of getting noticed and forgoing the rigors
of paying dues.</TE>
<TE>   This is clearly the rationale for the many struggling actors who
appear on TV's myriad dating shows hoping to be "discovered,"
probably as likely to happen as finding a mate in a half-hour minus
commercials.</TE>
<TE>   For them, the message is clear: The quicker, easier path to fame
lies through television, albeit with a small disclaimer -- namely,
you potentially forfeit pride and privacy and must have nary a second
thought about leaving inhibitions at the door.</TE>
<TE>   On the bright side, as Faustian bargains go, at least it's not
your immortal soul.</TE>

<HD>Soft Boys prove they're revived and kicking</HD>
<DH>The band mixes new and old tunes, plus guitar work as
distinctive as its lyrics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Natalie Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last year, English cult-pop figure Robyn Hitchcock and his early band
the Soft Boys delighted fans and impressed critics with a reunion
tour. This year the players released a fine new album,
"Nextdoorland," and during the group's performance Monday at the
House of Blues, the material proved as contemporary as anything by
all these young "rock revival" acts.</LD>
<LD>   In a 90-minute set, Hitchcock and guitarist Kimberley Rew, bassist
Matthew Seligman and drummer Morris Windsor mixed new tunes with
selections from their seminal 1980 collection "Underwater Moonlight"
and songs by Love and Bob Dylan.</LD>
<LD>   Singer-songwriter Hitchcock has a reputation for eccentricity,
fueled mainly by his use of freaky metaphors involving such un-pop
things as insects, bones and aquatic life to explore ordinary
emotional situations such as unrequited love and suburban childhood
drama. But on Monday his guitar work, while perhaps equally quirky,
was as distinctive as his lyrical imagery.</LD>
<TE>   On such new tunes as "Mr. Kennedy" and older favorites such as
"Insanely Jealous," he and Rew engaged in electrifying give-and-take,
often spinning into a warped jam-band sprawl while contrasting
guttural, Stones-esque blues-rock licks with jangling, angular riffs
reminiscent of Wire or Television.</TE>
<TE>   And, yes, they played the seminal antiwar song "I Wanna Destroy
You" (dedicated to Bush and Co., just like last year), but by then
the band had proved it was capable of much more than revisiting the
old days with enthusiasm and panache.</TE>

<LD>No decision has been made on the future of "Sex and the City," Home
Box Office said Tuesday, despite a comment by one of the stars that
the Emmy-winning comedy would end next year.</LD>
<LD>   Co-star Cynthia Nixon, in an interview with Fox News Channel,
indicated the coming season would be the show's last. As it stands,
the program is scheduled to resume production in March, after cutting
its schedule short this year because of star-producer Sarah Jessica
Parker's pregnancy.</LD>
<LD>   HBO does not have a deal on the series that goes beyond next year
but the possibility of securing one remains, network insiders said.
New episodes of the show probably will return next summer.</LD>

<LD>Film director Steven Spielberg, visiting Cuba for the first time,
said the United States should end its trade embargo against the
communist-run island and allow more cultural interaction with Cubans.</LD>
<LD>   "I personally feel that this embargo should be lifted. I do not
see any reason for accepting old grudges being played out in the 21st
century," Spielberg said at a news conference Monday. "It does not
make sense to me that my country will trade with North Korea and
China, but not with Cuba."</LD>
<LD>   Spielberg and his wife, actress Kate Capshaw, are in Cuba to
attend a festival of eight of his movies.</LD>

<HD>Bowers Museum gets state funds</HD>

<LD>The Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana will get a $4-million
chunk of state bond money to help it build a new wing to house
revolving collections from the British Museum in London, Gov. Gray
Davis has announced. An opening is targeted for 2005.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Ana Mayor Miguel Pulido said Tuesday that the city will use
the grant as a cornerstone for raising the additional $6 million
needed to build the addition, which would also house exhibits from
other museums around the world.</LD>
<LD>   "This is huge," Pulido said. "It gives us a strong vote of
confidence and a lot of momentum" to go after the private and public
donations needed to complete the project. He said he hopes the rest
of the money can be raised within a year.</LD>
<TE>   The city-owned Bowers, he added, is "getting very close" to a
final agreement with the British Museum that would allow it to mount
shows from the collection of the fabled London institution on a
revolving basis, with a new exhibit every nine months.</TE>
<TE>   The British Museum's traveling "Egyptian Treasures" exhibit was a
big hit at the Bowers in 2000 and gave rise to talks about an ongoing
partnership between the London and Santa Ana institutions. Pulido
says the Bowers partnership figures to "generate money for them and
for us."</TE>
<TE>   The $4 million comes from Proposition 40, a $2.6-billion bond
issue that California's voters approved in March for parks, cultural
and environmental uses. Davis has final say on which projects and
communities get the money. A spate of announcements have come during
election season, including the Bowers allocation and others for
renovating the Griffith Park Observatory and grants to museums in
Long Beach, Oakland, San Jose and other cities.</TE>

<HD>From trailer park to landmark</HD>

<LD>The Monterey Trailer Park is history.</LD>
<LD>   On a unanimous vote with no discussion Tuesday, the Los Angeles
City Council approved a "historic-cultural landmark" designation for
tree-shaded trailer park in Highland Park, which served as an "auto
camp" in the early days of long-distance car travel in the 1920s.
Officials say there are no other trailer parks on the city, state or
federal historical registers.</LD>
<LD>   "That's it?" asked manager Don Brown after the no-nonsense vote.</LD>
<TE>   "That's it," affirmed Ken Bernstein, preservation specialist with
the Los Angeles Conservancy, which lobbied for the designation.</TE>
<TE>   The 1.7-acre site stands in Highland Park near the city's border
with South Pasadena. Owner Peter Young, who had opposed the
designation, did not appear at the council meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, resident manager of the park and a 19-year tenant, said the
designation would make little difference in day-to-day life at the
site, where tenants continue to live in 22 trailers and mobile homes.
Under city law, however, the landmark designation restricts the
owner's ability to make changes at the site without getting city
approval first.</TE>

<KH>THEATER REVIEW</KH>
<HD>Of two 'Mames,' one has the edge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Shirley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>That old show about a brassy dame with the name of Mame, who had a
rather lame claim to fame, came to two theaters at the same time.
What a shame.</LD>
<LD>   Sorry, but when you're sitting through two "Mames" in one weekend,
you find little ways to amuse yourself.</LD>
<LD>   One "Mame" is more than enough. Each of the local productions, in
Long Beach and Thousand Oaks, lasts three hours, which is at least a
half-hour too long. It's not as if every moment of "Mame" is
priceless.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, the lumpy script by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee
would be improved if the entire first act finale were cut. Mame, a
fabled Manhattan hostess and surrogate mother to her orphaned nephew,
wins over a pack of sneering Southerners by entering and winning a
fox hunt, then sparing the fox's life. The scene is supposed to be
wacky, but it appears to have stumbled in from a different show.</TE>
<TE>   The later scene in which Mame insults a pack of sneering
Northerners whom her nephew is trying to impress, is only marginally
better. Her nephew's sudden change of heart rings false.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "Mame" has its hoary charms, most of them involving Jerry
Herman's lively score, and they are better realized in David
Galligan's staging for Musical Theatre West in Long Beach than they
are in the Cabrillo Music Theatre production in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   In Long Beach, Carol Lawrence was cast rather late in the "Mame"
game, but she takes charge with effortless panache. Clad in snazzy
attire from the Bob Mackie catalog, she dances with ease with a
chorus line whose average member is less than half her age. She even
does a cartwheel. Her singing is throaty and a little ragged in the
top register, but it fits the character. Her acting captures well
Mame's sense of good-hearted noblesse oblige.</TE>
<TE>   Sally Struthers and Ruth Williamson are funny as the repressed
Agnes Gooch and the high-flying Vera Charles. Eight-year-old Jakie
Batinga and Mark W. Smith fill the roles of the younger and older
nephew with confidence and charm. Amick Byram was a last-minute
replacement for Perry Stephens as Mame's Southern suitor, but he had
the role down pat.</TE>
<TE>   Galligan's staging adds a lot of little details that aren't in the
Thousand Oaks version. Mame climbs atop the grand piano, and later
dangles over the stage while sitting on a windowsill alongside her
nephew. "We Need a Little Christmas" includes an impromptu
jump-roping session. Gooch's dress splits at a critical moment.</TE>
<TE>   Melissa Walters is deliciously snide as both of the young women
villains. Roger M. Eaves looks and sounds like a genuine plutocrat as
the nephew's stern guardian. Jon Engstrom's staging in Thousand Oaks,
starring Amanda McBroom, is for a less professional organization, and
the stage looks a little threadbare, compared to the Gary Wissman
(sets) and Raun Yankovich (lighting) designs in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Cabaret queen McBroom's voice sounded a little under the weather
on opening night in Thousand Oaks. But perhaps her performance style
is also better suited to a smaller hall than this one. She looked
glitzy enough but didn't seem completely comfortable, especially in
the ensemble numbers. Yet her solo rendition of "If He Walked Into My
Life" was impressive.</TE>
<TE>   Joy Claussen as Vera, Casey Jones as Gooch, Colt Beyer-Johnson and
Corey Greenan as the nephew, and David Selby as Mame's husband
provided excellent support.</TE>
<TE>   One expendable little scene, involving the placement of a
sculpture in Mame's home, was funnier in Thousand Oaks than in Long
Beach.</TE>

<HD>The hardy native returns</HD>
<DH>Patience, a pickax, a few seeds and very little water turn
a drab strip of dirt into glorious winter and spring color.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Smaus</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Looking at the parched, bare dirt between the sidewalk and the
street, Timothy Stirton wondered what would grow there. He had just
purchased a house in Silver Lake that had been vacant for years and
was surveying his new garden. While sun-scorched ivy covered the
gentle slope between sidewalk and house, nothing grew in the trampled
and baked strip by the street, not even weeds. "It was not very
promising," he remembers.</LD>
<LD>   Then it hit him: Why not plant wildflowers, the next toughest
thing to weeds. The research assistant at USC's School of Medicine
had experimented with wildflowers before, so he knew how hardscrabble
tough they were. He gathered some California poppy seeds and
scattered them on the bare dirt in the fall, then waited for winter's
rains to bring them up. Five years later, several kinds of
wildflowers fill the parkway each spring. Poppies, arroyo lupin,
mountain garland, phacelia and other California wildflowers have
taken back the street, so to speak, at least in front of Stirton's
house.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the sorry-looking ivy on the hill has given way to
colorful native plants from the chaparral -- shrubs and perennials
like rosy buckwheat, ceanothus, matilija poppies, penstemon and wooly
blue-curls -- and a sprinkling of wildflowers to temporarily fill the
spaces between young plants.</LD>
<TE>   To get real California wildflowers, Stirton, 50, had to buy seed
packets from suppliers like Larner Seeds in Bolinas and the Theodore
Payne Foundation in the San Fernando Valley. Now he lets the plants
dry until they're "brittle and crisp," then he pulls or cuts them and
shakes the plants over the garden so the seeds fall out. "Where I
shake them, they grow," he says. The kinds that thrive in his garden
are tough and foolproof, "as long as they get sun and a little rain."</TE>
<TE>   First to bloom each spring are the bright orange poppies, quickly
followed by two other shades of poppy, a cream-colored one named
Moonglow and a strain named Mahogany Red. Then the purplish-blue
arroyo lupin and fiddle neck phacelia join in. The last to the party
are the pink and lavender clarkia, appropriately called
farewell-to-spring. His favorite is a tall species, Clarkia
unguiculata, or mountain garland, that blooms for a long time.</TE>
<TE>   These native wildflowers make a colorful spectacle for at least
part of the year, flowering from early March until July. Then they
die and dry up. "No amount of water will keep them going," says
Stirton. When they're done, they're done.</TE>
<TE>   A few things bloom in the parkway in summer and fall, including
some towering wild sunflowers and a few bold datura, with their huge
white flowers and stinky leaves, plus some California fuchsia that he
transplanted from another part of the garden.</TE>
<TE>   He also gets some summer color from the California poppies, which
behave like short-lived perennials. He cuts them back to stubs three
times during the growing season and they come back each time, a
little less vigorous than before, perhaps, but enough to keep the
parkway from becoming too dusty.</TE>
<TE>   But mostly the parkway lies bare in late summer and fall, until
watering or winter rains bring up the wildflowers again. This rather
abrupt seasonal change puzzles neighbors. "Everybody loves it when
the front is in bloom, but in summer and fall, they think I'm raising
a bunch of weeds. They call them flowers while they're in bloom,
weeds the rest of the year," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think a lot of people get it. They like what I've done
enough to ask for help and information, but then they go out and buy
impatiens at Home Depot." Water-loving impatiens are a far cry from
droughty wildflowers.</TE>
<TE>   Even a lot of so-called wildflowers are not. Things like annual
African daisies or corn poppies are native to other climates similar
to ours. True wildflowers have a special cachet. They were here
before we built our homes, so native insects and birds are attracted
to them. Conversely, they don't tend to attract the pests like giant
whitefly that plague exotic plants. Stirton never uses chemical
sprays, if for no other reason than that he does not want to kill any
of fascinating native bugs and butterflies attracted to the natives,
like the pretty little butterfly appropriately called a Blue, whose
larva eats the leaves of certain native plants.</TE>
<TE>   Coaxing the blooms</TE>
<TE>   Stirton says growing wildflowers isn't hard -- that's one of the
reasons he grows them -- but getting seeds to germinate and take hold
the first couple of years can be difficult. When he was establishing
the plants, he would wait until after the first substantial rain,
usually after Thanksgiving but sometimes in October or early
November. He would sow a few days later, in moist soil, even though
it might not rain again for a month or more. He often sows more seed
in February to lengthen the bloom season.</TE>
<TE>   He does not prepare or improve the soil, though he says getting
rid of weeds is a good idea (you will have to weed wildflowers,
especially during a rainy winter). He roughens the soil first, with a
pickax.</TE>
<TE>   After sowing, if the soil begins to get too dry, he adds a
sprinkling of water, just enough to keep the seeds damp.</TE>
<TE>   Before the lupin became established, he had a hard time getting
them to sprout, so he would let the seed sit on a wet paper towel for
a few days, until the root barely began to poke out of the seed coat,
then quickly planted the barely sprouted seeds. For the last few
years, however, all he has to do is shake the dry seed over the
garden and the lupin has returned. "I think I must now be growing
some mutant kind that has adapted to this garden."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's an example of natural selection and evolution at
work. Or perhaps just natives determined to reclaim this little piece
of L.A.</TE>

<TE>   2. Plant in bare dirt in fall. Let nature take its course with
rain and sun. (If needed to help germination, add a sprinkling of
water.)</TE>

plant for next season, just shake the dried plants over the garden

<HD>Having it all: It's a matter of fiction</HD>
<DH>Allison Pearson swears she and character Kate Reddy are
very different. But she understands a career woman's struggle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Salter Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Women used to have time to make mince pies and had to fake orgasms,"
thinks Kate Reddy, harried working mother in Allison Pearson's new
novel, "I Don't Know How She Does It," at the bleary hour of 1:37
a.m., fresh off a plane and trying to crumble the crust of two
store-bought pies so they look homemade for her daughter's Christmas
pageant. "Now we can manage the orgasms, but we have to fake the
mince pies."</LD>
<LD>   Kate Reddy began life as a joke: a meeting that a friend of
Pearson's attended in which the male head of the company, chagrined
by the temporary loss of a valuable employee, asked with great
frustration, "Why does childbirth have to take so long?"</LD>
<LD>   "When I heard that story," says Pearson, herself fresh off a
plane, having left two children but not in the slightest bit harried,
"I heard a dark, rich, bitter laugh, and I knew it came from Kate. I
thought, if I could only capture that laugh in a character! And so I
began collecting Kate Reddy moments." Moments such as these found in
the book:</LD>
<TE>   "If I stay in the bathroom long enough Richard will fall asleep
and will not try to have sex with me. If we don't have sex, I can
skip a bath in the morning. If skip the bath, I will have time to
start on the e-mails that have built up while I've been away ... "</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I find nonworking mothers awkward company because
it's like someone standing there holding up a large polished mirror,
the better to show the reflection of my guilt."</TE>
<TE>   There's also the time Kate hides in the laundry room so her
17-month-old son won't see her leaving for the airport at 7 a.m.
There are the countless times she tries to avoid the local "Muffia,"
the stay-at-home moms who are compelled to make Kate feel inadequate.
There's the time she gets stopped at customs because her nightmare of
a purse contains, along with diapers and half-eaten candies, a urine
sample she was supposed to leave at the doctor's.</TE>
<TE>   Pearson insists that she and Kate are entirely different people,
though some of the principles in "I Don't Know How She Does It" are
universal. "The crux of the book is captured in one line in the
novel," Pearson says: "Women hold the puzzle of family life in their
heads."</TE>
<TE>   Pearson launched Kate Reddy as a weekly column for the Telegraph
in London, where she lives with her family. With her first column,
Pearson was inundated with mail and Kate Reddy moments. Critics have
called her the next Bridget Jones, or Bridget Jones 10 years later.
Marjorie Williams, in her review of the novel in the Washington Post,
wrote, "Here, at last, is the definitive social comedy of working
motherhood." Kate Betts in the New York Times took it a bit more
seriously, calling it a "painfully sad story about the sordid
disparity between the ideal and the reality of 'having it all.' "</TE>
<TE>   Both are true: The novel is a roller coaster of tension, humor,
despair and pain (leaving sick or sad children to go to business
meetings on the other side of the world) as Kate Reddy struggles to
make it as a 36-year-old asset manager at a stodgy London firm. She
has two children, a boy 17 months and a 5-year-old girl. Her husband,
Richard, is a somewhat unsuccessful architect who tries pathetically
to get his wife's attention for months before walking out.</TE>
<TE>   Pearson's husband is Anthony Lane, the well-known film critic for
the New Yorker. . Pearson swears that he in no way resembles Richard.
The couple are thinking of leaving London for New York and have begun
to look at schools for their kids, ages 7 and 3. Pearson is thinking
seriously about having a third child, so her life must not resemble
Kate's too closely: Kate would probably rather be flayed alive than
have another.</TE>
<TE>   And Pearson is a journalist, not a money manager, though
journalism can still be a haven for Neanderthal policies regarding
parental leave and working motherhood. Even so, Pearson is more
interested in the biological hard-wiring that seems to place the most
stress in family care on the woman. The politics is an extension of
cultural assumptions and traditional division of labor, including
emotional labor.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax paid $2 million for the book's film rights, and while
Pearson would like to stay out of it, she has become a little
protective of Kate. "Everyone sees herself in Kate, which I love,"
she says over a glass of wine on Abbott Kinney Boulevard in Venice.
"There is nothing more wonderful than children," she says. "Being a
mother is a creative act."</TE>
<TE>   So is writing a novel, and there were many moments when the two
competed mightily in Pearson's life. "A man can really focus and
tunnel in on a project; a woman is constantly distracted. The largest
piece I'd ever written was 5,000 words. This was really an excavation
of self, which made it acutely exhausting. I'll never write another."</TE>
<TE>   Pearson put Kate in the heart of London's "City," or Wall Street
equivalent, because "it is really the heart of the beast." Is it any
worse in London than here for a woman to work in an office? "I don't
think so," says Pearson thoughtfully. "I think it might be worse in
America." But London has its share of horror stories. "In England,
you've got the guys who were beaten and sodomized in school and they
think everyone should have to fight to survive." A woman lawyer
Pearson knows said it was better to claim a cocaine addiction as an
excuse for dropping work rather than admitting anything to do with
children.</TE>
<TE>   "Only the childless have had bad reactions to this novel," she
says, after hearing a quote from the review that ran in the
Independent, in which Joan Smith accuses Kate of being a "poor little
rich girl" and Pearson of "1970s feminism."</TE>
<TE>   "We're supposed to feel like they are doing us a favor if they let
us come back to work at all after having children," Pearson
paraphrases a character in her novel, Jill, who, before dying, writes
her husband a lengthy memo about how to run the family life ... what
cycle to use so socks won't shrink, etc.</TE>
<TE>   "All I knew was that I didn't want my mother's life," says
Pearson, who says her mother was woefully overqualified for
housewifery. "There are two kinds of mothers: resentful and guilty.
I'd rather be guilty."</TE>
<TE>   Pearson feels the book has been particularly well received (it hit
No. 7 on Amazon and No. 8 on both the Los Angeles Times and the New
York Times bestseller lists, next to Tom Clancy and Stephen King)
because it is more of a laugh than a rant. Above all, we are not
supposed to sound shrewish. We are not supposed to complain. That
might sound too "feminist."</TE>
<TE>   Pearson, at least, has irony if not hope. She finds the book tour
exhausting, even if she does get to, as Kate so longs for, "sleep
alone." But she doesn't mind sticking it out. "The one thing I can't
do is die," she says. "They need me too much."</TE>

<HD>Male hosts find right chemistry in talking about 'Other
Half'</HD>
<DH>Show with Dick Clark, Dorian Gregory, Danny Bonaduce and
Mario Lopez earns commitment through 2002-03 season and time slot
change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Sachs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the morning after election day and the winners and losers are
busy poring over the results, gloating about what went right or
agonizing over how it all went wrong.</LD>
<LD>   But for the syndicated daytime gabfest "The Other Half," the
results were in several days ago, and the vote of confidence couldn't
have been clearer: The second-year show received a commitment through
the remainder of the 2002-03 season while also earning a shift
locally from noon to a plum 3 p.m. weekday start time on KNBC-TV
Channel 4.</LD>
<LD>   It's a rather remarkable achievement for a premise that had to
sound dubious at best at the pitch meeting: A show aimed at women,
but hosted by an all-male quartet that included former cast members
of "The Partridge Family" and "Saved by the Bell."</LD>
<TE>   But when the latter two -- ex-tabloid poster boy Danny Bonaduce
and "Bell" heartthrob Mario Lopez -- took the stage with TV mogul
Dick Clark and actor/musician Dorian Gregory ("Charmed"), an odd
thing happened: The chemistry worked. Clark is as smooth as ever in
the elder statesman role, Lopez shows surprising versatility in
jumping from goofy bits to moderator of serious-minded discussions,
and the charismatic Gregory knows how to bob and weave through it
all. But it's Bonaduce who's the strongest presence, providing the
glue that holds it all together with his sheer energy and
self-deprecating wit. Sure, the bits sometimes fall flat, but hang in
there, something more interesting is usually right around the corner.</TE>
<TE>   The foursome can dress in drag (Clark as "The Wizard of Oz's"
Dorothy on Halloween was a sight to behold), interview a nursing
audience member and campaign for breast cancer all within an episode
or two, and the show's gears make scarcely a sound in handling the
shifts.</TE>
<TE>   Tune in and see how "The Other Half" lives.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With the World Series over, Fox finally put its prime-time lineup on
the field, scoring with "The Simpsons" and "24" while struggling with
its new dramas, based on viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen
Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   CBS regained the overall lead, despite lower TV viewing levels
Thursday -- its most-watched night -- because of Halloween. Still,
with "The Simpsons" attracting its biggest premiere audience in five
years and "24" far surpassing last year's average, Fox finished
behind NBC among the younger demographics advertisers seek, leaving
CBS and ABC in a third-place tie. (In an example of how local and
national ratings can vary, the percentage of homes watching "24" in
the Los Angeles viewing area was roughly 50% higher than the show's
U.S. average.)</LD>
<LD>   Fox's new dramas, meanwhile, are cause for concern. The network
already canceled "Girls Club," and "Fastlane," "Firefly" and "John
Doe" were all underwhelming last week.</LD>
<TE>   Buoyed by "The Bachelor," which continues to gain ground on "The
West Wing," ABC delivered its biggest audience this season. "NYPD
Blue" also drew its highest rating in nearly a year, and "The George
Lopez Show" retained 90% of the lead-in audience from "My Wife and
Kids."</TE>
<TE>   HBO's "The Sopranos" was the most watched cable offering, ranking
third in its slot behind "Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent" and "Malcolm
in the Middle."</TE>

<HD>Football Star Tells of Agent's Foibles</HD>
<DH>Quarterback Drew Bledsoe testifies in the lawsuit between
sports agents Leigh Steinberg, David Dunn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Frammolino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First came the precedent- setting rookie contract, followed by a
blockbuster $42-million pact with the New England Patriots -- at the
time the largest player contract in National Football League history.</LD>
<LD>   But the relationship between super-agent Leigh Steinberg and Super
Bowl quarterback Drew Bledsoe was about more than money. The two
became closely identified with each other's success -- so much so
that Bledsoe's photograph as he announced that record contract is
among the opening scenes of "Jerry Maguire," the 1996 romantic comedy
loosely based on Steinberg's life.</LD>
<LD>   With that as a backdrop, Bledsoe's testimony was all the more
stinging Tuesday, when the quarterback, who now plays for the Buffalo
Bills, took the stand in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles against
his former agent.</LD>
<TE>   His voice often dipping into a barely audible mumble, Bledsoe
testified that incidents of Steinberg's alleged drunkenness through
the years led the quarterback to sever ties and follow Steinberg's
former protege, David Dunn, as he set up a rival firm in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Over a period of time, it became apparent to me that my
association with Leigh could possibly be embarrassing to me," said
Bledsoe, who was the Patriot's starting quarterback when the team
lost the Super Bowl in 1997 to the Green Bay Packers.</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg's firm filed a $40-million lawsuit against Dunn and his
new company, Athletes First, accusing him of stealing more than 50 of
its football clients and threatening blackmail if Steinberg
retaliated. Dunn countersued.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Steinberg's firm accuse Dunn and other renegade
employees of stealing confidential information and conspiring to
savage the star agent's reputation. Among other things, Steinberg has
been accused in legal papers of binge drinking, taking credit for
others' achievements and of engaging in sexual indiscretions,
including one alleged incident in which a Las Vegas prostitute stole
his wallet.</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg has admitted on the stand he has battled drinking. And
his longtime partner Jeffrey Moorad described him to the jury as a
"mad genius" replete with eccentricities.</TE>
<TE>   Other testimony by players and former employees has portrayed
Steinberg as a disorganized, unkempt "Jekyll and Hyde" personality
who messily chewed tobacco and yelled at workers. He allegedly licked
the faces of two female employees at golfing tournaments, angrily
shook a female assistant by the arms in a crowded hotel lobby and
once fell down drunk and told a male employee: "I want to eat your
leg."</TE>
<TE>   Adding to that unflattering litany on Tuesday was Bledsoe, the
former Washington State star who signed on with Steinberg's agency
out of college in 1993 and has been one of its marquee clients. In
"Jerry Maguire," Bledsoe has a cameo appearance in which he declines
to follow the movie's lead character as he strikes out on his own.</TE>
<TE>   In real life, Bledsoe did just the opposite, and on Tuesday he
cited three occasions that prompted him to rethink his association
with Steinberg.</TE>
<TE>   The first was at Bledsoe's May 1996 wedding, where he said
Steinberg got so drunk that friends and family asked: "Who the hell
is that guy?"</TE>
<TE>   Another came at a party Bledsoe gave after the 1996 American
Football Conference division playoffs. Bledsoe said Steinberg was
inebriated and made a sexual pass at the wife of Robbie Tobeck, now a
center with the Seattle Seahawks. Bledsoe said the incident forced
him to apologize to Tobeck's wife.</TE>
<TE>   The third came before the 1998 Pro Bowl in Hawaii, when Steinberg
visited the mini-bar so many times during a late-night discussion in
Bledsoe's room that he "passed out on the deck." The quarterback said
he draped a blanket over the agent and went to sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg's attorneys said he would not be available for comment
during the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe said his concerns about associating with Steinberg came to
a head in January 2001, when he asked to meet with Dunn to discuss,
among other things, "my concerns with Leigh's personal behavior and
it possibly reflecting on me." The athlete said he then asked Dunn if
he ever thought about going out on his own and recommended a
Boston-based venture capitalist who might help.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe said he first learned about Dunn's departure when he
answered several voicemail messages the agent left during Presidents
Day weekend last year. "When he told me he had left, I said, 'Great!
What do we do next?' " Bledsoe soon fired Steinberg and hired Dunn.</TE>
<TE>   In March 2001, Bledsoe signed the largest contract in NFL history,
a 10-year, $103-million pact with the Patriots. Bledsoe testified
Tuesday that Steinberg sent him a bill for the 3% commission on his
earnings but that he didn't pay it because Dunn handled the contract
negotiations. Steinberg has filed grievances with the NFL Players
Assn., claiming his firm was owed the fees from Bledsoe and other
clients of Dunn because contract negotiations began while Dunn still
was part of Steinberg's agency.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn testified later in the day that Bledsoe's encouragement
served as a catalyst for him to think more seriously about leaving
Steinberg's firm.</TE>
<TE>   Although possibly the most famous, Bledsoe is only one of several
pro football players who have testified or been deposed in the
hard-fought case, which is scheduled to go to the jury this week in
Judge Ronald S.W. Lew's courtroom. Others have included Cleveland
Browns linebacker Jamir Miller, Carolina Panthers offensive lineman
Todd Steussie, Atlanta Falcons running back Warrick Dunn, Kansas City
tight end Tony Gonzalez and Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Kordell
Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Some players have been called by Dunn's attorney to praise Dunn's
skills as an agent while complaining about Steinberg's disheveled
appearance and estrangement. Miller complained that he could never
get ahold of Steinberg. "I pay the man a lot of money," he said. "He
should return my calls."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, however, Steinberg attorneys called retired
quarterback Warren Moon to the stand. Now a sports agent with the
firm, he testified that Steinberg had been a responsive and savvy
agent for him. Moon said Steinberg advised him to skip the 1978
college draft and prove himself by playing in Canada because many NFL
franchises believed black quarterbacks "couldn't lead football
teams." He said Steinberg landed him a contract with the then-Houston
Oilers in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving the courtroom Tuesday, Bledsoe said he appeared
voluntarily to support Dunn and regretted he had to express his
misgivings about Steinberg.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never been my desire in any way, shape or form to disparage
Leigh," he said. "But in a court setting, you're sworn to tell the
truth."</TE>

<HD>Oversight Board Launch Threatened</HD>
<DH>Accounting panel has no staff or budget and maybe no
leader. First meeting set for Nov. 13.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine days before the first scheduled meeting of the Public Accounting
Oversight Board, the panel has no budget, no office, no staff -- and
maybe no leader.</LD>
<LD>   "Dates for two meetings have been set. I'm not aware of anything
else that's been done," said Willis Gradison, a former Republican
congressman from Ohio and a member of the new board.</LD>
<LD>   The panel, set up by congressional directive in the aftermath of
this year's wave of corporate accounting scandals, was supposed to
put teeth in federal oversight of the accounting industry.</LD>
<TE>   But its designated chairman, former federal judge William H.
Webster, is under fire for his work as a director of a small company
that has been sued for fraud.</TE>
<TE>   And the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the new
board's work, is in turmoil over allegations that Chairman Harvey L.
Pitt did not share information about Webster's past with other SEC
commissioners ahead of their confirmation of Webster on Oct. 25.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt resigned from the SEC late Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The controversies threaten to delay the launch of the accounting
board. By law, it must be in place by early spring.</TE>
<TE>   "What you wanted to see was progress in establishing a foundation
-- a chairman and board members that inspired confidence and a budget
that enabled them to do something, and a staff," said Michael Granof,
an accounting professor at the University of Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't see any of that."</TE>
<TE>   Gradison said Webster had coordinated everyone's schedules to set
the first two meeting days, on Nov. 13 and Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   But Webster said Monday that he is prepared to resign if he
decides that the storm over his work on the board audit committee of
U.S. Technologies Inc. in 2001 has become an "impediment" to the
board's effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt's resignation Tuesday could spur Webster to do the same, some
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "If Harvey doesn't make it, Webster isn't going to make it
either," said Eric Sussman, an adjunct faculty member at the Anderson
business school at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   That may hobble the new accounting board -- which was created to
ensure that auditors are ethical, independent and produce
high-quality work -- before it gets started, some experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The board is supposed to register all accountants who audit public
companies, create auditing standards and decide how audits should be
reviewed, a task that until now has been left primarily to the
accounting industry itself.</TE>
<TE>   A federal corporate reform law passed in July requires the board
to be up and running before April 26.</TE>
<TE>   SEC spokesman Brian Gross said the board probably will set a
budget, which the SEC must approve, by its second meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC will advance the accounting board money from its 2003
budget to operate until the board starts collecting fees from public
companies, as mandated under the law.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the board is still on schedule," Gross said.</TE>
<TE>   It was anticipated that the board members would spend a couple of
weeks removing themselves from their previous jobs, he said.</TE>

<HD>Calpine's Profit Down, but Progress Reported</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calpine Corp. reported a 50% drop in third-quarter earnings Tuesday
because of depressed electricity prices and a shriveled trading
business.</LD>
<LD>   The San Jose power plant builder posted third-quarter net income
of $161.3 million, or 36 cents a share, down from $320.8 million, or
88 cents a share in the same quarter last year. Not counting one-time
gains on the sale of discontinued operations and charges from the
cancellation of power plant projects, Calpine would have earned
$170.9 million, or 38 cents a share, in the third quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue for the quarter slipped to $2.49 billion from $2.52
billion.</LD>
<TE>   Although third-quarter income was sharply lower than analysts had
expected Calpine to earn, it was close to the diminished expectations
generated in recent months as the energy-trading industry
disintegrated after Enron Corp.'s collapse and a series of trading
and accounting scandals. The average Calpine earnings estimate of
analysts survey by Thomson First Call was 40 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Calpine reported that cash is building again in the
business and that the company is making progress in asset sales and
debt-refinancing talks. Calpine, which owns 75 power plants, said it
benefited from the relatively low cost of operating its new
facilities and from long-term energy contracts, which help insulate
the company from rock-bottom power prices.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good quarter," Calpine Chief Executive Peter Cartwright
said in a morning conference call. "In spite of low electricity
prices, we have continued to operate profitably."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts and investors were cheered by these rare nuggets of good
news in a battered sector, causing Calpine's stock to rise 19 cents,
or 7.3%, to $2.79 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine's earnings "were not a disaster, and that has been a
virtue lately," said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst with Williams
Capital Group.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine executives said the company has been cutting costs
aggressively, including layoffs of nearly 400 employees, or about 10%
of its work force.</TE>

<HD>Charter, Adelphia Reduce Forecasts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Charter Communications Inc. and Adelphia Communications Corp., two of
the nation's largest cable businesses, cut financial forecasts after
losing subscribers to satellite television rivals.</LD>
<LD>   Charter, ranked fourth in size among U.S. cable companies,
estimated that cash flow would be lower during the fourth quarter
than some analysts had predicted. Adelphia, the nation's
sixth-largest cable business, cut its full-year estimate for a
similar category by 16%.</LD>
<LD>   Both companies have lagged behind cable-industry rivals in
upgrading their systems to offer more channels and services such as
high-speed Internet access and video on demand, analysts said.
Satellite television companies such as DirecTV Inc. and EchoStar
Communications Corp. are exploiting this weakness to win market
share.</LD>
<TE>   "Satellite is doing very well in attacking underserved and
un-upgraded cable" companies, said Alan Bezoza, a cable services and
equipment analyst for CIBC World Markets.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia, which has been the subject of an accounting scandal
involving its founders -- the Rigas family -- reported in a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission that its bankruptcy
filing in June had disrupted company marketing efforts. The lapse,
according to the filing, negatively affected "customer acquisition
and retention" and encouraged satellite competitors "to increase
their marketing targeted" at Adelphia subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Other cable operators have better withstood the challenge, in part
because they have upgraded a larger percentage of their systems to
digital cable that operates at a bandwidth of 750 megahertz,
permitting more channels and services to flow to customers.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia reported Tuesday that it lost 70,000 customers during the
third quarter. The number of basic subscribers was 5.78 million as of
Sept. 30, down from 5.85 million on June 30. Charter has lost almost
400,000 cable subscribers this year.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia shares fell half a cent to 11.5 cents in over-the-counter
trading. Charter shares fell 27 cents to $1.18 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Circuit City Expects to See Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Circuit City Stores Inc. said Tuesday that it will have a loss this
quarter as consumers trim spending on more-profitable items including
satellite television systems. Shares of the No. 2 U.S. electronics
retailer fell 13%.</LD>
<LD>   The company expects a third-quarter loss of 5 cents to 8 cents a
share, excluding store-remodeling costs, in the quarter ending Nov.
30, rather than an unspecified small profit, spokeswoman Celeste
Gunter said. Circuit City also withdrew its fourth-quarter forecast.
Shares of Best Buy Co. and RadioShack Corp. declined.</LD>
<LD>   Profit margins are being hurt as sales of cellular phones costing
as much as $250 slow and fewer people sign up for $32-a-month
satellite-TV dish plans, Circuit City said. Chief Executive Alan
McCollough is remodeling stores and has replaced appliances with more
compact discs and video- game software to lure customers from No. 1
Best Buy.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Richmond, Va.-based Circuit City fell $1.35 to $8.85 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Circuit City, which has more than 600 stores, said it withdrew its
profit forecast for the fourth quarter because of a slowdown in
consumer spending.</TE>

<HD>CSC Earnings Rise 36% Despite Dip in Revenue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Colker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thanks to business derived from homeland security projects and the
continued growth of technology in outsourcing, Computer Sciences
Corp. said Tuesday that its fiscal second-quarter profit rose 36%
despite a dip in revenue.</LD>
<LD>   The El Segundo firm -- the No. 3 computer-services firm in the
U.S. -- reported net income for the three months ended Sept. 27 of
$92.9 million, or 54 cents a share, compared with $68.2 million, or
40 cents, a year ago. Its revenue fell to $2.7 billion from $2.8
billion a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   The revenue decrease reflects cutbacks at companies that are
putting off projects and reducing costs while awaiting brighter
economic times.</LD>
<TE>   But CSC executives stressed that demand from the U.S. government
-- one of the company's most important customers -- remained strong.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to see the federal government as a key component of
our future performance," Chief Financial Officer Leon Level said
during a conference call with analysts.</TE>
<TE>   CSC benefited from increased government spending on security and
intelligence, along with infrastructure modernization and an
increased reliance on outsourcing, Chief Executive Van Honeycutt
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. federal IT [information technology] services market is
growing well and industry sources are expecting the total IT budget
for the government's fiscal 2003 to increase by about 10% over last
year," Honeycutt said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Overseas, CSC saw a softening of demand for its computer and
financial services in Europe and Asia.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which laid off about 900 workers last year, does not
plan further cutbacks in personnel in the foreseeable future,
Honeycutt said.</TE>
<TE>   CSC's shares fell 86 cents to $33.35 on the New York Stock
Exchange before the results were released. They fell as low as $31
before recovering slightly in after-hours trading.</TE>

<HD>EBay Mulling Over Move From San Jose</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Colker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EBay Inc., which started life in a converted extra bedroom in San
Jose in 1995, soon will outgrow its 10-building campus in the heart
of Silicon Valley and is considering relocating.</LD>
<LD>   In a memo to employees seeking their suggestions on where the
company should move, Chief Executive Meg Whitman does not rule out
leaving the San Jose area.</LD>
<LD>   "We have not yet made any decisions," Whitman wrote in the memo
sent last week to nearly 3,000 staff members at company headquarters.
"We are very thoughtfully exploring all the options and will keep you
informed every step of the way."</LD>
<TE>   One of the options, of course, is for current EBay employees to
stay put while the company expands elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   But what makes people nervous is the prospect that the entire
company could leave town.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman Kevin Pursglove said EBay, which is considered the one
unqualified e-commerce success and is closely identified with Silicon
Valley, has a lease on its current buildings until 2006.</TE>
<TE>   PayPal, which was recently acquired by EBay, also is outgrowing
its office space in nearby Mountain View.</TE>
<TE>   The company already operates customer service centers in Salt Lake
City and Omaha.</TE>

<HD>EchoStar Races to Save DirecTV Deal</HD>
<DH>The company seeks an expedited trial on a suit blocking the
proposed merger, but a judge turns down the request.</DH>

<LD>WASHINGTON -- EchoStar Communications Corp. moved Tuesday to revive
its proposed merger with satellite TV rival DirecTV, but a federal
judge rejected EchoStar's bid for an emergency trial to hear the
government's lawsuit blocking the deal.</LD>
<LD>   In a request that government attorneys called unreasonable,
EchoStar asked U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle to begin a
trial on Nov. 18 and limit it to 10 days.</LD>
<LD>   "Clearly it was a ploy," said Missouri Atty. Gen. Jay Nixon, one
of 23 state officials who also oppose the merger. "Based on the level
of comments and the complexities of the technical issues, that's
absurd."</LD>
<TE>   Government attorneys estimate that a trial -- which would be one
of the biggest antitrust battles ever waged -- would last four to
five weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed merger between EchoStar and DirecTV's parent, El
Segundo-based Hughes Electronics Corp., would have created a
satellite television giant with 18 million customers nationwide. But
the deal suffered a serious blow last month when the Federal
Communications Commission and the Justice Department both rejected
the deal. Regulators said the merger would give the combined company
a pay-TV monopoly in many rural markets, resulting in higher prices
and decreased service.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing in Washington, Huvelle denied EchoStar's request,
questioning whether there was sufficient grounds to grant an
expedited trial.</TE>
<TE>   An EchoStar spokesman said the company would push for a trial at
the earliest possible date while simultaneously looking for ways to
settle the case.</TE>
<TE>   "We intend to continue to work to explore remedies that might
satisfy the Department of Justice," said EchoStar spokesman Marc
Lumpkin.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disappointed that the district court denied our request for
the expedited trial," said Hughes spokesman Richard Dore. "We will
continue to consult with EchoStar on our next options."</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar is racing to save its merger with Hughes by Jan. 21, when
the merger agreement between the companies formally expires.</TE>
<TE>   But Huvelle told the companies that's not her problem. She noted
that it was within the companies' power to extend the Jan. 21 date if
they want.</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV officials, who are increasingly reluctant to pursue the
deal, have said they do not expect to extend the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   After their request for an expedited trial was denied, EchoStar
attorneys asked the judge to set a January trial date, according to a
Justice Department spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Assistant U.S. Atty. Hew Pate countered that the Justice
Department would prefer a trial in June.</TE>
<TE>   The judge indicated that the earliest possible trial date would be
late February or early March. She scheduled another hearing for
Thursday to discuss the matter.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Service Sector Growth Slows</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. service sector expanded for the ninth straight month in
October, though at a slightly slower pace than in September, a report
said Tuesday, another sign that the economic recovery has lost
momentum.</LD>
<LD>   The report, by the Institute for Supply Management, supports
expectations that the Federal Reserve will make only a modest cut in
short-term interest rates at its regular policy meeting today, to try
to shore up the recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, separate reports on U.S. chain store sales showed
sluggish growth. Economists worry that consumer spending, which
already has slowed, could stall in coming months.</LD>
<TE>   Instinet Research said in its weekly Redbook report that store
sales fell 0.6% in the four weeks ended Nov. 2, while the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi and UBS Warburg reported that store sales rose 1.1%
in the week ended Saturday after a 1.9% fall the previous week.</TE>
<TE>   The Institute for Supply Management said its monthly index of
non-manufacturing activity fell in October to 53.1 from 53.9 in
September, above forecasts for a decline to 51.7 and above the key 50
mark, indicating the sector still is expanding.</TE>
<TE>   "The report was consistent with very sluggish growth, but we
haven't reached the point where it's consistent with negative
growth," said Alan Ruskin, research director at 4Cast Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   Two components that are key barometers of future growth raised
warning flags: New orders slowed in October to 50.9 from 52.3, the
lowest point since January, and employment continued to contract.</TE>
<TE>   The service sector makes up about 80% of the U.S. economy and
includes such areas as financial services, transportation and
entertainment.</TE>

<HD>Nevada Accuses El Paso, Sempra of Collusion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nevada's attorney general has sued Houston-based El Paso Corp. and
San Diego-based Sempra Energy, accusing the companies of conspiring
with Enron Corp. and others to squeeze natural gas supplies to Nevada
and California during the energy crisis of 2000-01 to inflate energy
prices.</LD>
<LD>   "This suit is necessary to recover damages and penalties on behalf
of consumers who have been victimized by the collusion among these
companies, which were in a position to dominate and manipulate the
market," Nevada Atty. Gen. Frankie Sue Del Papa said in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   The antitrust lawsuit, which was filed Friday in Clark County
State Court, mirrors lawsuits filed in California that claim that El
Paso and Sempra, parent of Southern California Gas Co. and San Diego
Gas &amp; Electric Co., agreed to refrain from competing with each other
by limiting expansion of competing pipelines. These include the Kern
River Pipeline, which runs through the Las Vegas area on its way to
the Central Valley.</LD>
<TE>   The suit also echoes accusations made to federal regulators that
El Paso withheld natural gas supplies on a key pipeline to California
-- one owned by an El Paso subsidiary -- by placing a huge portion of
the pipeline's shipping capacity in the hands of another El Paso
subsidiary. El Paso was aided in this effort by Enron and Dynegy
Inc., which held the capacity for a time while El Paso worked out its
plan to sell the pipeline capacity to a sister company, the lawsuit
said.</TE>
<TE>   But the Nevada lawsuit aired a new accusation: that El Paso
conspired with Enron and Sempra to reap profit from the
extraordinarily high natural gas prices of late 2000 and 2001 by
selling derivatives contracts to the two companies.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso repeatedly has said it had no motive to withhold gas
supplies because it was locked into "hedge" contracts at below-market
rates. El Paso has never named the purchasers of those contracts.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso and Southern California Gas representatives said the
charges were without merit, and Enron and Dynegy declined to comment.
"Our interest is in lowering rates rather than raising them," said
Denise King, spokeswoman for Los Angeles-based Southern California
Gas.</TE>
<TE>   The suit names as defendants El Paso and Sempra Energy. Enron and
Dynegy, both of Houston, were accused of conspiring with El Paso and
Sempra to withhold supplies but were not named as defendants.</TE>

<HD>More Time for Media Study Comments</HD>
<DH>Still scheduled for completion in the spring, the FCC's
review is expected to result in the easing of some ownership limits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Federal Communications Commission's ambitious initiative to
review the nation's media-ownership restrictions fell slightly behind
schedule Tuesday as the agency agreed to extend the public-comment
period by 30 days.</LD>
<LD>   But FCC officials said they still hoped to complete the
comprehensive review by next spring as planned.</LD>
<LD>   Under pressure from consumer groups and Democratic Commissioner
Michael J. Copps, FCC Media Bureau Chief W. Kenneth Ferree agreed to
give interested parties until Jan. 2 to respond to a dozen media
studies released last month by the commission. The studies tried to
measure whether rising media consolidation has reduced the diversity
of viewpoints expressed on television.</LD>
<TE>   The FCC's review of the decades-old media rules is expected to
result in the relaxation or suspension of some restrictions that
regulate the ownership of television broadcasters, newspapers, radio
stations and other media companies.</TE>
<TE>   Since releasing the studies, the commission received six petitions
requesting that the agency extend the deadline for public comment.
Copps and others also called for public hearings, though Ferree has
questioned the usefulness of hearings and did not grant one in
Tuesday's order.</TE>
<TE>   One consumer group criticized the extension as inadequate. "The
FCC should have granted much more time, including an agreement to
hold field hearings," said Jeff Chester, director of the Center for
Digital Democracy. "This FCC proceeding makes a mockery of what
should be the model of an informed debate."</TE>
<TE>   Also in its order Tuesday, the FCC agreed to release some of the
underlying data used in the 12 studies and to make study authors
available to those seeking more information about how research was
conducted.</TE>

<HD>Rate Cuts Didn't Spur Businesses</HD>

<AU>Peter G. Gosselin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- As political Washington spends today picking at the
bones of the congressional election to figure out how much will
change, economic Washington is poised to do something very similar.</LD>
<LD>   If surveys of prominent forecasters are correct, the Federal
Reserve will cut its benchmark federal funds rate from its current
41-year low of 1.75% to 1.5%, or perhaps 1.25%. The action almost
certainly will be hailed as just what the staggering U.S. economy
needs.</LD>
<LD>   The only problem: The new cuts are unlikely to do much good, and
could do some harm.</LD>
<TE>   That's partly because the Fed already has cut rates a lot, and low
interest costs have worked much of the magic they can.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, consumers have replaced one-third of all
the country's cars and financed or refinanced almost all of its
houses. Banks are unlikely to offer 30-year mortgages at much below
5.75%. Automakers are going to be hard pressed to beat the
interest-free financing they already offer.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody can claim that Fed rate reductions haven't given consumer
spending a big boost," said David M. Jones, a Denver economic
consultant and commentator.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, some worry that the boost is distorting the economy.
Two-thirds of last quarter's growth was due to auto sales.</TE>
<TE>   And that still hasn't been enough, largely because the central
bank has been unsuccessful with the other actor in the nation's
economic drama: business. And therein lies a clue to why its new rate
cuts are unlikely to make much difference.</TE>
<TE>   To appreciate how unsuccessful, see the accompanying chart of bank
loans to business. The way the system is supposed to work, when the
Fed raises rates, lending falls; when it cuts rates, lending climbs.
But in the last few years, the very opposite has happened.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fed hasn't been able to convince businesses to borrow from
banks, or anybody else for that matter," said Mark Zandi of
Economy.com, a West Chester, Pa., forecasting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Some who advocate a new round of Fed rate cuts contend that the
central bank simply did not cut far enough and fast enough to get the
results it wanted and now must finish the job. They may have a point.</TE>
<TE>   After getting a roaring start by slashing the funds rate 11 times
in 2001, Fed policymakers stopped in their tracks and have not budged
for almost a year. One way to gauge the dimensions of their pause is
to compare it with the Bank of Japan's performance in the early
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The Bank of Japan has become symbolic of bad central banking
because it raised rates just as Japan's stock market and economy were
coming apart and was slow to reverse course and begin cutting.
Americans have taken no end of comfort from the notion that their
central bank acted very differently.</TE>
<TE>   But if one dates the start of the Japanese bust to the collapse of
the Nikkei stock average in 1990 and the start of the U.S. bust to
the free fall of the Nasdaq index in 2000, the performances of the
two central banks begin to look a lot more alike. Roughly three years
into their respective troubles, U.S. and Japanese policymakers had
each shaved between 4.5 and 4.75 percentage points from their
benchmark interest rates. The only difference was that Fed officials
acted faster, then stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "They did the right thing; it just wasn't enough," said Allen
Sinai, chief global economist with Decision Economics Inc. in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Sinai and others say that more rate cuts, and substantially
steeper ones than the Fed is likely to approve today, eventually will
return the economy to good health. But the fact that the cuts to date
have not done the trick -- and have made almost no difference to
American businesses -- suggests two distinctly darker possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   The first, and by now generally conceded, point is that this is no
ordinary economic slowdown. It is one caused by the bursting stock
market "bubble" that was a dream for businesses while it was
ballooning and has been a nightmare since it popped.</TE>
<TE>   The second, and more heretical, notion is that there's not much
the Fed or any central bank can do about this kind of slowdown. The
only solutions are huge tax cuts or simply waiting it out.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in the middle of a great experiment that asks whether an
aggressive central bank can stop a big recession after a big stock
market bubble," said John H. Makin, an economist with the
conservative American Enterprise Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know the answer yet, but if it's no, people's faith in
central banks as buffers against serious recession or depression is
going to be badly shaken," Makin said.</TE>
<TE>   In this view, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues made
a fundamental mistake about the late 1990s, and especially about
corporate America's spending spree on new technology.</TE>
<TE>   "They thought that technology and the capital-spending boom was
driving the stock market up when it was the other way around," said
Robert J. Barbera, chief economist with ITG/Hoenig in Rye, N.Y. "The
surging stock market was providing the funds to fuel the
capital-spending boom."</TE>
<TE>   So what should the Fed do? On this point, economists' advice is a
little disconcerting: Cut anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "If a patient is ill, you give him medicine," Sinai said. "It may
do very little good, but you give it anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Unless, of course, it's the wrong medicine.</TE>

<LD>Secession was poised to lose on Tuesday's ballot, but all of Los
Angeles owes a vote of thanks to the people of the San Fernando
Valley who carried the flag of independence.</LD>
<LD>   That's because they've forced all of us to take a hard look at the
way the city is governed -- and, in the process, have helped to
expose the burdensome procedures and high taxes that hurt local
businesses and all of Southern California's economy.</LD>
<LD>   Decades ago, Los Angeles was run by a coterie of businessmen --
known as the Committee of 25 -- who decided municipal policy over
drinks at the California Club and had their vice presidents of
government affairs relay their wishes to the mayor and City Council,
who were happy to do their bidding.</LD>
<TE>   But the complexion of the business community here changed long
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the economy of Los Angeles and the surrounding region is
driven by entrepreneurial, small to medium-sized ventures that do not
have corporate vice presidents to run interference with a political
process that now regulates companies more than it listens to them.</TE>
<TE>   These businesses still need City Hall for building and franchise
permits, as well as for street repair, police protection and the
like. In Los Angeles they pay higher business taxes for these
services than are charged in almost all other municipalities in
Southern California -- or indeed throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, these businesses must pay consultants, lawyers and
other intermediaries just to approach City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "For a small business such fees can run $10,000 to $50,000" a
shot, says Larry Kosmont, a onetime city official in Bell Gardens and
Burbank whose consulting firm publishes a survey comparing the cost
of doing business in California cities and those of some other
states.</TE>
<TE>   Several owners of medium-sized companies say the cost of access to
Los Angeles City Hall can easily run into the hundreds of thousands
of dollars a year. And even then the process is torturous.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather have pins stuck under my fingernails than do business
in the city of Los Angeles," says one large Southern California
automobile dealer.</TE>
<TE>   But, partly because of the pressure brought to bear by the Valley
separatists, the structure of city government and financing may well
be changing.</TE>
<TE>   One intriguing idea is to divide Los Angeles into nine boroughs --
three in the San Fernando Valley, six in the city south of Mulholland
Drive. Such a setup could help businesses have easier access to
government.</TE>
<TE>   "The genie is out of the bottle," says attorney David Fleming of
Latham &amp; Watkins, co-leader of the Valley secession movement. "I
think we'll see a proposal for boroughs on the ballot next year."</TE>
<TE>   The business-tax system, which accounts for more than $1 billion
of Los Angeles' $5-billion annual budget, also is on the verge of
getting fixed. A commission of municipal and business officials,
including executives from the Valley, already is at work to reform
the gross-receipts tax, a centerpiece of L.A.'s levies on business.</TE>
<TE>   Though a city certainly needs a strong tax base, the
gross-receipts measure is badly designed. It's particularly onerous
for big-ticket businesses such as automobile dealerships -- one
reason Ford dealer Bert Boeckmann in North Hills was Fleming's
co-leader of the Valley's secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is a huge city, of course, with 3.5 million people and
34,500 municipal employees. But for all its size and wealth, it
squanders much of its potential political power.</TE>
<TE>   A study this summer by the Rose Institute of State and Local
Government at Claremont McKenna College found that L.A. trails such
prominent cities as Chicago and New York -- and even local burgs such
as Long Beach -- in getting its share of state and federal grants and
aid. That hurts local companies because the more grants the city
gets, the more support it can give them and the less it needs to
reach into their pockets.</TE>
<TE>   The irony is that Los Angeles should be a magnet for federal funds
because it has one of the most ethnically diverse business sectors in
the country.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most active entrepreneurs here is Danny Villanueva of
Bastion Capital, a promoter of Latino businesses. There's also
Dominic Ng, head of East West Bank, which is fanning out from its
roots in the Asian community of Monterey Park to become a force in
finance throughout the region.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Woo of Megatoys has helped make Los Angeles a center of
the global toy industry, and David Lee is a respected real estate
owner and developer in a surging Koreatown. Earvin "Magic" Johnson,
the basketball Hall of Famer, has become a star investor in South Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   And there are many, many more successful small-business owners one
could name. Yet the city does relatively little to reach out to these
folks. If anything, the bureaucracy is stifling them.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles needs to "eliminate the perception that this city is
cold and difficult for small companies," says Bruce Ackerman, head of
the Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley, a group of firms
that remained neutral on the secession issue but is a forceful
advocate of a strong future for business in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   No one is saying that the city should return to the days of the
Committee of 25. But a little smoother give and take between business
and government is an imperative as a still-unified Los Angeles moves
forward.</TE>

<HD>Haggard Says Heart Didn't Need Fixin'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rick Wartzman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Country music legend Merle Haggard knows a thing or two about
cheatin' hearts. Cheating on heart surgeries, however, is a whole
different matter.</LD>
<LD>   The 65-year-old recording artist, who is currently on tour, came
home to Redding the other day to find the town in an uproar over
allegations that a couple of doctors at the local medical center may
have been pushing patients to undergo heart surgeries they haven't
really needed. Haggard, it turns out, had a pair of heart stents put
in by one of the doctors, Chae Moon, about five years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Haggard said, he's convinced that the fear he has long
harbored in the back of his mind is completely warranted. "I
suspected when it was done to me that I didn't need" an operation, he
said. "There's a very good chance I may be a prime example of what
Dr. Moon did. The whole thing has made me mad. I'm just waiting here
for the FBI to contact me."</LD>
<TE>   The FBI raided Redding Medical Center, which is owned by Tenet
Healthcare Corp., last week. Agents also searched Moon's offices, as
well as those of his colleague, Dr. Fidel Realyvasquez. No one has
been charged.</TE>
<TE>   Moon didn't return a phone call Tuesday seeking comment. Neither
did his lawyer. A Tenet spokesman said that whether Haggard's surgery
was proper is "a question for Dr. Moon to answer.... We have limited
ability to judge medical necessity. That's not a question for us."</TE>
<TE>   Haggard -- whose hits include "I'm Gonna Break Every Heart I Can"
-- said that in 1995, he had an angioplasty procedure performed in
Nashville to help pry open his clogged arteries. Afterward, he felt
terrific and was given a clean bill of health. "They told me
everything looked good," Haggard recalled.</TE>
<TE>   So it was surprising, he said, when he went to Redding Medical
Center in the summer of 1997 for a checkup and was told by Moon that
his heart was failing. Moon recommended that he immediately operate
on Haggard to put in stents, small tubes that are inserted in heart
valves or arteries to keep them from collapsing. Haggard said he had
emergency surgery that same day -- but always had doubts about
whether the operation was truly necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "It just didn't hit me right," said Haggard, who moved to a ranch
just outside Redding from his native Bakersfield in the late 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   He said his misgivings were heightened when the drummer in his
band, the Strangers, also checked into Redding Medical Center about
three years ago. Biff Adam was back from the road, feeling a little
weak and complaining of some chest pain, when he went to see Moon.</TE>
<TE>   After some tests, Adam remembered in an interview Monday, the
doctor delivered the bad news: The left muscle in his heart was badly
damaged. Moon "went up to my wife and said, 'Your husband needs a
heart transplant,' " Adam recounted. "She almost passed out."</TE>
<TE>   Adam said his family doctor in Redding, Morris Ballard, suggested
that he get a second opinion. He did, from Dr. Robert Pick, who wound
up treating Adam not with surgery but with a drug called Coreg, which
lowers blood pressure. "That straightened me out," Adam said. "I
didn't need a heart transplant -- that's for damn sure."</TE>
<TE>   Both Pick and Ballard were traveling Tuesday and couldn't be
reached.</TE>
<TE>   Haggard's '97 surgery wasn't his only experience with Moon. On
another occasion, he said, he took a treadmill test at Redding
Medical Center, after which Moon informed him that he needed to be
put on a blood-thinning medication. Haggard said Moon also made clear
that "I'd be a candidate for open-heart surgery in five years."</TE>
<TE>   That time, Haggard said he ignored Moon's advice, declining to
take the medication. He doesn't figure he'll be going in for any more
heart surgery, either -- at least not with Moon.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to wonder," said Haggard, "did he tell me the truth at
any time?"</TE>

<HD>Paying Less May Cost Taxpayers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Internal Revenue Service plans to start charging a "user fee"
when economically troubled taxpayers ask to pay less tax than they
owe through a so-called offer in compromise.</LD>
<LD>   In proposed regulations issued Tuesday, the agency said taxpayers
requesting an offer in compromise would have to pay a $150 fee.
Taxpayers who earn less than the federal poverty guidelines -- that's
roughly $18,100 for a family of four -- would be exempted from the
fee, as would those who join the program to settle a disputed debt.</LD>
<LD>   The fee is aimed at discouraging frivolous offers and at
recovering a portion of the cost of processing the compromise
requests, which are submitted by roughly 125,000 taxpayers each year.
The IRS says it costs $471 to $3,983 to process each such request.</LD>
<TE>   "The fee is not intended to discourage taxpayers from filing
good-faith offers," said Bruce Friedland, an IRS spokesman in
Washington. "But the IRS does expect that the fee will discourage
inappropriate offers."</TE>
<TE>   The IRS estimates that 5% to 8% of the offers in compromise
received each year are simply tactics aimed at stalling collection by
the IRS.</TE>
<TE>   The agency said only about half the requests received each year
are processed. The rest either don't include enough information or
don't meet the program's criteria.</TE>
<TE>   An offer in compromise is a formal program in which government
officials consider whether an individual taxpayer will be allowed to
settle a tax debt for less than what's owed. Generally, the taxpayer
must be willing to give up all of his or her assets to have an offer
accepted, according to an IRS guide.</TE>
<TE>   Agency statistics indicate that accepted offers allow taxpayers to
settle their debts for 10 cents to 15 cents on the dollar owed.</TE>
<TE>   Once a taxpayer submits an offer, the IRS suspends all efforts to
collect the tax due until the offer has been formally accepted or
rejected. The offers, which require significant verification of
assets and income, can take years for the IRS to complete, said
Philip J. Holthouse, partner with the Los Angeles tax law and
accounting firm Holthouse Carlin &amp; Van Trigt.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some accountants were critical of the fee, mainly because
it's imposed on taxpayers who already are financially troubled.</TE>
<TE>   "There is certainly a lot of irony here," said Joe Parker, tax
hotline coordinator at H&amp;R Block Inc. in Kansas City, Mo. "These are
people who are saying, 'I can't afford to pay you.' " And the IRS is
responding with, 'We'll talk about it after you give us $150.' "</TE>
<TE>   Comments on the proposed rule will be accepted until Feb. 4. The
IRS then will hold public hearings Feb. 13.</TE>

<HD>Firm Buys Supplier of Anti-Pirate Software</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boosting its bid in the nascent market for copy-protected CDs,
Macrovision Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif., has acquired a leading
supplier of software for preventing songs on a CD from being copied
onto a computer.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, announced Tuesday, calls for Macrovision to pay about
$25 million for the assets and operations of Midbar Tech Ltd., a
privately held company in Tel Aviv.</LD>
<LD>   Macrovision also announced that it is acquiring music copy
protection and rights-management technology developed by Israeli firm
TTR Technologies Inc. for about $5 million.</LD>
<TE>   Macrovision dominates the market for copy-protected videotapes,
and its technology is used to block VCRs and digital recorders from
copying DVDs, premium cable and satellite TV broadcasts. Working with
TTR, it has been developing technology for "secure" CDs that deter
online piracy while still enabling consumers to copy songs from the
discs onto their computers.</TE>
<TE>   Midbar has been developing similar technology, while also offering
versions designed not to allow any copying. The company says that its
technology has been used on more than 30 million CDs.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of those releases have been in Europe and Asia.
Few secure CDs have been issued in the U.S., in part because the
major record labels are waiting for technology that lets consumers
copy songs and burn them onto a limited number of homemade CDs.</TE>
<TE>   The label with the most secure CDs on the market appears to be
Vivendi Universal subsidiary Universal Music Group, which has
released four secure CDs. Two have sold more than 200,000 copies
each: movie soundtracks "More Fast and Furious" and "Brown Sugar."</TE>
<TE>   Adam Sexton, vice president of marketing at Macrovision, said the
acquisitions will accelerate development of technology enabling
consumers to make a limited number of disc copies that cannot be
duplicated further. That technology should be available by mid-2003,
he said.</TE>

<HD>Nasdaq Takes Breather; Dow Rises Again</HD>
<DH>Some investors continue to hunt for bargains among the blue
chips, while others mark time before today's Federal Reserve meeting.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks closed mixed Tuesday as investors awaited the outcome of the
election and today's Federal Reserve meeting.</LD>
<LD>   Blue-chip indexes ended higher, while the Nasdaq market took a bit
of a breather.</LD>
<LD>   Traders in the Treasury bond market also marked time, as yields
inched up amid the government's sale of $22 billion of new five-year
notes.</LD>
<TE>   In other markets, oil prices slid, as did the dollar against the
euro.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrials gained 106.67 points, or 1.2%, to
8,678.27, the highest close since Aug. 28, as some investors
continued to hunt for bargains among blue chips.</TE>
<TE>   But winners held only a modest edge over losers on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   On Nasdaq, losers were in the slight majority, though the
composite index still rose 4.63 points, or 0.3%, to 1,401.17 -- the
first close above 1,400 since Aug. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts attributed Tuesday's blue-chip rally, which gained
momentum in the last hour, to investors anticipating a
Republican-controlled Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get a sweep by the Republicans, that raises a lot of hope
as far as tax incentives going forward. This market has a sense that
the Republicans are going to recapture the Senate," said Peter
Cardillo, strategist at Global Partners Securities.</TE>
<TE>   But the market has had momentum in its favor as well: After four
straight weeks of gains, helped by better-than-expected third-quarter
corporate earnings, many investors believe the bear market finally is
over and that it's a good time to buy stocks.</TE>
<TE>   "You are hard pressed to sell into these kind of moves," said
Bryan Piskorowski, market commentator for Prudential Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipation of today's Fed meeting also provided some lift. The
market is expecting the central bank to cut its benchmark short-term
interest rate by 0.25 point to 1.5% to help the economy.</TE>
<TE>   In the bond market, short-term Treasury yields were little changed
Tuesday, while longer-term yields edged up as the Treasury sold new
five-year notes at a yield of 3.03%.</TE>
<TE>   The government today will sell $18 billion of new 10-year notes.
The yield on the existing 10-year note rose to 4.07% on Tuesday from
4.04% on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In currency trading, the dollar fell to a 3 1/2-month low of 99.9
cents against the euro on expectations of lower U.S. rates.</TE>
<TE>   In oil markets, crude futures for December delivery slid 81 cents
to $26.14 a barrel in New York on expectations that a revised U.S.
resolution at the United Nations setting arms-inspection terms for
Iraq will delay military action against that nation.</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * The Dow got a lift from Procter &amp; Gamble, up $2.24 to $88.74;
Boeing, up $1.85 to $31.52; and Exxon Mobil, which added $1.32 to
$35.58.</TE>
<TE>   * In the tech sector, Microsoft rose 58 cents to $56.68,
continuing its advance in the wake of a judge's approval of an
antitrust settlement that was largely in the software giant's favor.</TE>
<TE>   At the company's annual meeting in Bellevue, Wash., Chief
Financial Officer John Connors rejected suggestions that Microsoft
should start paying cash dividends.</TE>
<TE>   Because of continuing legal challenges despite the antitrust
settlement, "The board has determined it would not be appropriate to
commit to a long-term program like a dividend," he said.</TE>
<TE>   * Among other tech issues, Adobe Systems dropped $1.56 to $25.82
after Deutsche Bank Securities downgraded the shares to "sell" from
"hold."</TE>
<TE>   * Amgen rallied $1.72 to $50.08. The company said Monday that one
of its experimental drugs was found in a study to help dialysis
patients.</TE>
<TE>   * Broadway Financial, Los Angeles-based parent of Broadway Federal

<HD>State Sells Nearly All of Power Bonds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Debora Vrana</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California completed the bulk of its record offering of power bonds
Tuesday, selling a total of $6.5 billion of fixed-rate securities
amid strong demand from individual and institutional investors.</LD>
<LD>   With tax-free yields on the bonds offering returns well above what
many other investment-grade securities are paying, investors such as
Arnold Laven of Encino found the bonds a good deal.</LD>
<LD>   "I was getting about 1% in a money market fund, so I liked the
yield," said Laven, 80, who got a combined 3.5% rate on a mix of
insured and uninsured bonds at six-year maturities. "At my age, I
didn't want to go out too far."</LD>
<TE>   On Friday and Monday the state took orders totaling $1.5 billion
from small investors. On Tuesday institutional investors were invited
to bid.</TE>
<TE>   State Treasurer Phil Angelides called overall demand for the bonds
"very strong." He said about 90 institutions, including mutual funds,
put in offers.</TE>
<TE>   The securities, delayed by political wrangling for more than a
year, were sold as part of an $11.3-billion bond deal in total,
proceeds of which will repay loans California took on to buy power
during the energy crisis of 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The bonds aren't direct obligations of the state; they will be
paid off during the next 20 years by surcharges on the electricity
bills of the state's major utilities.</TE>
<TE>   Partly because of the sheer amount of bonds sold and partly
because of the political and legal risks the securities carry,
institutional investors demanded slightly higher returns than what
are available on other investment-grade tax-free bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The state agency selling the bonds, the Department of Water
Resources, on Tuesday raised the top yield to 5.48% on an uninsured
20-year bond, up from the 5.45% quoted to small investors Friday. The
bonds were sold in maturities ranging from 2 1/2 years to 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Individual buyers will get the higher yields if the bonds they
ordered Friday also were available to institutional investors,
according to Angelides and bankers at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., the
deal's lead underwriter.</TE>
<TE>   The higher yields will cost the state slightly more per year in
interest costs, Angelides said. But he said the deal cost the state
as much as 1 full percentage point less in interest than what
analysts had estimated last year, when market interest rates in
general were much higher.</TE>
<TE>   The bond sale had been delayed by various hurdles, including most
recently a lawsuit filed in October by utility Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
Co. that questions a plan to use utility revenues to back the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "The real test will be where the bonds are trading in a few
months," said Steve Galiani, director of municipal bonds for Wells
Capital Management in San Francisco. "We could see some news on power
contracts or lawsuits that could affect the trading."</TE>
<TE>   Because the yields are exempt from federal and state income tax
for California residents, the true returns can be sharply above the
stated yields.</TE>
<TE>   A 5% tax-free muni yield provides a taxable equivalent return of
about 9% for someone in the top tax bracket.</TE>
<TE>   "I told my wife, 'Look at these yields,' " said Zane Mann,
publisher of the California Municipal Bond Advisor newsletter in Palm
Springs. "And she said, 'Yes, look at our SoCal Edison bill -- we're
going to be paying off those yields.' "</TE>

<HD>News Corp. Ad Sales Double Net Income</HD>
<DH>Revenue climbs 12% in its fiscal first quarter compared
with last year on performances by television operations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>News Corp. more than doubled its fiscal first-quarter net profit,
fueled by strong advertising sales at its U.S. television stations,
Fox broadcast network and cable channels that more than compensated
for a wider loss at its satellite operations and a downturn in its
newspaper business.</LD>
<LD>   The Australia-based company reported Tuesday that net income was
$162 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $73 million in
the same period a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   News Corp.'s earnings per share rose to 12 cents, up from 6 cents
a year ago. Sales jumped 12% to $3.8 billion, up from $3.4 billion in
the year-ago quarter.</LD>
<TE>   The company released its results after the stock market closed.
News Corp. shares rose 5 cents to $24.65 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Entertainment Group reversed its $22-million loss from a year
ago and reported net income of $214 million for the first quarter.
The improved results were partly due to Fox broadcast network
narrowing its quarterly operating loss to $8 million, from a
$43-million operating loss a year ago, as the talent show "American
Idol" bumped up the network's summer ratings 13%.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Entertainment's cable group, which includes the Los Angeles
Dodgers, several regional sports channels, FX and the Fox News
Channel, swung to an $83-million operating profit in the quarter,
from a $16-million operating loss the previous year. News Corp. said
ad sales in the quarter tripled at Fox News as ratings surged ahead
of rival CNN, owned by AOL Time Warner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call with analysts, News Corp. Chairman Rupert
Murdoch touted Fox News Channel's growth potential, pointing to new
advertising deals at rates higher than its longer-established
rival's.</TE>
<TE>   News Corp. officials also said advance advertising sales at its TV
station group -- the nation's largest --have gained momentum since
the end of the first quarter, growing 13% for November and 21% for
December.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Murdoch estimated that advertising sales for the TV operations
would grow by only 5% in the current fiscal year. He said, however,
that there are no signs of another recession.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not assuming a slowdown," Murdoch said.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to questions about a potential purchase of Hughes
Electronics Corp., the owner of DirecTV, Murdoch said his company had
not held talks with Hughes' parent, General Motors Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulators last month blocked the proposed merger of
DirecTV and satellite rival EchoStar Communications Corp., giving
Murdoch another chance to buy DirecTV after losing a bidding war last
year.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was offered to us, it would be [about] a year before it was
consummated and then we don't know what kind of damage might be
done," said Murdoch, referring to the potential deterioration in
DirecTV's value since GM put Hughes on the market last year. He said
if News Corp. made an offer, it would be for GM's 30% stake in
Hughes, which has a total stock market value of about $10 billion,
about half of what it was a year ago.</TE>

<HD>Orange County Now Feeling the Squeeze</HD>
<DH>Several economic signs are weaker than its neighbors'. Some
analysts ask whether the area is becoming more like L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Hirsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Economists who keep careful track of California suddenly are asking
what's wrong with Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   So is Milt Thomas, owner of Buena Park-based Wire Cut Co., a maker
of medical devices and technology equipment whose annual sales have
plunged to $4 million from $12 million since April 2001, forcing him
to slash his work force by two-thirds and leaving him with just 27
employees.</LD>
<LD>   So is Jesse Perez, who lost his print shop job almost a year ago
when the Irvine-based business was sold and the new owner laid off
several workers. At one point, he was in danger of losing his home.</LD>
<TE>   For most of the last two decades, Los Angeles' neighbor to the
south epitomized all that was right with the California economy.
Orange County was the most resistant to recession and often the first
county to rebound from downturns. Its economy even withstood the
county government's bankruptcy, which was due to lousy investments.
It generated well-paying jobs in technology, health care and apparel
and was a key driver of the Southern California tourism economy.</TE>
<TE>   Today, though, the Orange County economy is showing signs of
fatigue:</TE>
<TE>   * The number of jobs is declining.</TE>
<TE>   * New claims for unemployment insurance are rising at a faster
rate than in other Southern California counties.</TE>
<TE>   * Weekly earnings for factory workers are dropping faster than in
neighboring regions.</TE>
<TE>   * Bankruptcy filings are increasing.</TE>
<TE>   * The rate of growth in home sales is slowing and may flatten
after rising at a torrid pace for much of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County is a victim of the broader malaise afflicting the
economy. Its technology and tourism industries have been hit
especially hard. At the same time, many analysts expect the Orange
County economy to rebound much like Silicon Valley's.</TE>
<TE>   As the region's woes have become more pronounced in recent months,
some economists are beginning to ask whether something more
fundamental is occurring. Is Orange County's economy in the middle of
a natural structural shift in which it is starting to look more like
the mature urban economy of Los Angeles?</TE>
<TE>   Like L.A. in previous recessions, Orange County now is seeing
high-paying manufacturing jobs relocating to neighboring regions such
as the Inland Empire and to other states, a process exacerbated by
the county's high home prices.</TE>
<TE>   "Go talk to the people in the Inland Empire to find out where the
newest high-growth suburban economy is," said Dennis Aigner, a former
UC Irvine business school dean who now heads the Bren School of
Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the number of payroll jobs grew in September by 2.7%
in the Inland Empire from a year earlier, and in San Diego job growth
rose 1.8%. During the same period, Orange County lost 2,900 jobs, a
0.2% decline.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically, Orange County excels and would compete with San Diego
and the Inland Empire for the strongest job growth in the region,"
said Howard Roth, chief economist at the California Department of
Finance. Now, "Orange County is behaving more like Los Angeles, and
that is striking."</TE>
<TE>   No one is saying Orange County's economy is a disaster. The county
unemployment rate stood at 4% in September, up from 3.4% a year
earlier but still well below the state jobless rate of 6.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Still, all Rosario Limonchi knows is that she lost her position as
a designer for a Costa Mesa sportswear company and has yet to land a
new job. "It is very hard to find a job right now in Orange County,"
said the Corona del Mar resident.</TE>
<TE>   For Milt Thomas, who founded Wire Cut 24 years ago, seeing his
company shrink to a third of its former size and letting go so many
workers has been devastating.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Wire Cut's three primary industries, semiconductors and
commercial aerospace, are in deep slumps. Eighteen months ago Thomas
delivered the last order to the computer chip company that once was
his biggest customer, and he doesn't expect orders to pick up for at
least a year.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy is a big discussion right now wherever I go," Thomas
said.</TE>
<TE>   It may well take a while to determine whether Orange County is in
the middle of a true historic economic shift because some of the data
that would help complete the picture, such as personal income trends
and taxable sales, won't be available from the government until next
year at the earliest. And even then, some analysts say it could be
years before enough evidence accumulates to know whether Orange
County's economy really has undergone a seminal transformation.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, numerous indicators point to trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Near the top of the list is the 3% dip in average weekly earnings
of workers in manufacturing industries -- everyone from seamstresses
to satellite builders. Their paychecks, on average, have fallen to
$569.62 from $585.48 during the first nine months of this year,
compared with the same period in 2001, according to data compiled by
the state's Employment Development Department.</TE>
<TE>   The only other county in Southern California -- from Ventura to
San Diego -- to experience a decline in average weekly earnings was
Los Angeles, where manufacturing workers brought home on average
$552.68, a 1% dip from the year before. Other Southland regions and
the state as a whole posted small increases during the same period.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, new claims for unemployment benefits in Orange County
rose 47% for the first eight months of 2002, compared with the same
period a year earlier, higher than in any other Southern California
region by 12 percentage points. And after declining for much of the
year, bankruptcy filings -- personal and corporate -- rose 3% in
August in the county.</TE>
<TE>   Construction of office and retail space also has taken a dive,
according to the Construction Industry Research Board. The value of
nonresidential building permits in Orange County plunged 22% during
the first eight months of the year. Only Los Angeles had a steeper
decline, 25%.</TE>
<TE>   The only cluster of positive economic signs in Orange County
concerns residential real estate. For instance, the value of permits
for new residential construction rose 7% in August. Although that was
below the double-digit gain in the Inland Empire, it still was
healthy compared with the other regions in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's median home price rose to $368,000 in September, a
gain of 20.7% from a year earlier and near the all-time high. "People
are taking advantage of low mortgage rates to get into homes," said
John Karevoll, a DataQuick analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone has written off Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Economist Steven Levy of the Center for the Continuing Study of
the California Economy, a Palo Alto think tank, said Orange County
"is being hit worse than one expected," but eventually will resume
its place on the fast track.</TE>
<TE>   "What I am seeing is a technology-oriented, high-growth suburban
economy that has gone bad with the slump," Levy said. "Orange County
is not behaving like Los Angeles. It is behaving like the Silicon
Valley of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "I am guessing recovery will be slower, because the tech
overcapacity was severe and will cause folks to be cautious about
building up production too quickly before the market confirms
growth," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For those in the Orange County trenches, though, a robust economy
is fast becoming a distant memory.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the county has evolved," said factory owner Thomas. "And
because we are neighbors with Los Angeles, the lines have blurred."</TE>

<HD>Mediator Calls for Pause in Port Talks</HD>
<DH>The one-week break will allow management to review the
longshore union's request for enhanced pensions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal mediator called for a one-week break in contract
negotiations covering West Coast dockworkers Tuesday, after the
shipping industry and longshore union failed to reach agreement on a
pension package.</LD>
<LD>   The adjournment was a sign of frustration in the San Francisco
hotel where talks have been held for nearly two weeks, despite a
breakthrough deal on labor-saving technology announced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   In a brief written statement, Peter J. Hurtgen, director of the
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, indicated that the
Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents 79 shipping lines and
terminal operators, needed time to review the union's demands for an
enhanced pension package.</LD>
<TE>   Spokesmen for the association and the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union declined to comment, citing the mediator's request
for a news blackout during negotiations. But sources close to the
talks said earlier that hopes for a quick mediated settlement had
faded over the weekend as tempers flared over pension proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the maritime association offered an increase of nearly
25% in the pension plan, bringing the retirement pay for a fully
vested longshore worker to about $50,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   But the union said it expected a larger increase than that, now
that it has accepted new computer systems and other technological
advances that would cause the loss of hundreds of high-paid clerk
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "While the ILWU is prepared to continue with the negotiations, and
our talks have proceeded in good faith," mediator Hurtgen said,
"management has requested additional time to evaluate anticipated
technology-based operational savings and pension funding costs into
future years."</TE>
<TE>   Talks are set to resume Nov. 13.</TE>
<TE>   Hurtgen was given authority over the negotiations by an Oct. 8
federal court order that reopened West Coast ports after a 10-day
employer lockout. Shipping lines said the lockout was in response to
disruptive union slowdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The parties, which handle about $300 billion in cargo moving
through the ports each year, have been in negotiations since mid-May.</TE>

mascot.</LD>
<LD>   Cano, an executive producer of the 1983 film "Silkwood," sees the
Angels' Rally Monkey as a perfect role model for kids and wants to
make a movie featuring the crowd-pleasing primate. He has filed a
trademark application for the term "Rally Monkey" and a script
treatment with the Writers Guild of America.</LD>
<LD>   There's only one problem. The real parents aren't willing to part
with the furry fellow. The team as well as major league baseball say
they have prior rights to the name.</LD>
<TE>   "The mere fact that somebody filed for trademark registration does
not give them any special legal status," said Rick Schlesinger, an
Angel lawyer. "Our position is that 'Rally Monkey' is a protected
trademark of the Angels."</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention the fact that Walt Disney Co., which owns the
Angels, might want to make its own Rally Monkey movie someday.</TE>
<TE>   The monkey with seemingly miraculous powers made his first
appearance June 6, 2000, when the Angels, losing to the San Francisco
Giants, needed a boost. The operator of the Sony Jumbotron in
centerfield played a clip from the movie "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"
that showed a capuchin monkey jumping up and down.</TE>
<TE>   Fans went wild, the team won and a tradition was born.</TE>
<TE>   Until this year, the monkey restricted his appearances to inside
the stadium. But as the Angels moved closer to the baseball playoffs,
the monkey made his way to T-shirts and other items.</TE>
<TE>   "Never give up, do the best you can, come from behind -- it's just
a fantastic film idea," said William Levin, an intellectual-property
attorney representing Cano.</TE>
<TE>   Cano, who lives in Newport Beach and says he is a lifelong Angel
fan, declined to be interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   Intellectual-property experts say the producer has little chance
of enforcing his trademark application.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot hijack a trademark by filing an application against
the rightful owner," said Alfred W. Zaher, a trademark attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rally Monkey started out as a whimsical, lighthearted
in-stadium promotional vehicle," the Angels' Schlesinger said. "It
was not intended nor was it ever expected to be something you could
make money off of.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a common misconception that we are trying to corner the
markets on monkeys," he added. "You can always buy a stuffed monkey.
Whether you buy it from us or at a local store, we welcome it. What
we are trying to protect is the use of the term 'Rally Monkey.' "</TE>

<HD>Redding's Spotlight Turned Into an Unwanted Glare</HD>
<DH>Town is divided over investigation into doctors</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald D. White and Don Lee</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>REDDING -- Ever since the Gold Rush era, this town has been
accustomed to economic cycles of boom and bust. When the last big
moneymaker, the timber industry, faded away, the only constant seemed
to be its prime location -- at the center of the so-called Golden
Circle, which attracted hikers, fly fishermen and other outdoor
enthusiasts to Mt. Shasta, Lassen Peak's active volcanic area and
other pristine wilderness nearby.</LD>
<LD>   But in the last decade, the town became a magnet for a different
kind of visitor. Patients from as far away as Sacramento, the Oregon
border and eastern Nevada have descended on Redding, drawn by Redding
Medical Center's growing reputation as a leading center for heart
surgery.</LD>
<LD>   In 1993, the 238-bed hospital, owned by Tenet Healthcare Corp.,
embarked on an ambitious plan to build a heart institute. Two years
later, a five-story medical wing rose up in the center of town,
intensifying a rivalry with Redding's other hospital, Mercy Medical
Center, and setting up what would become an economic boon for Tenet
but also for the town.</LD>
<TE>   The two hospitals "are a real key component of the economy here,"
said Doug Latimer, Shasta County's chief administrative officer.</TE>
<TE>   But now, Redding Medical has put an unwanted glare on this town of
88,000 on the Sacramento River, which appears deeply divided about
the hospital and the two doctors who built up its cardiac practice
and now are being investigated for allegedly performing numerous
unnecessary procedures and surgeries.</TE>
<TE>   Since a raid of the hospital by 40 federal agents last week,
dozens of former patients of Dr. Chae Moon and Dr. Fidel Realyvasquez
are wondering whether they were unnecessarily operated on. But other
patients and medical staff have come to their defense, holding a
candlelight vigil and providing equally stirring testimonials about
how Moon, the hospital's director of cardiology, and Realyvasquez,
chairman of cardiac surgery, saved their lives.</TE>
<TE>   One thing most everyone will agree on is that for years there have
been whisperings in the community and elsewhere about whether Redding
Medical was being overly aggressive with heart procedures. In fact,
in recent years HMO firms and some medical groups pulled out of the
Redding area, saying they were losing too much money because the
filing of health-care claims was off the charts.</TE>
<TE>   "Redding is the highest cost of care per population in all of
California," said Steve McDermott, chief executive of Hill Physicians
Medical Group. McDermott said his doctors group pulled out of Redding
at the end of last year, after losing almost $1 million last year
serving 22,000 HMO members there.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Shield of California said it would stop providing HMO service
to members of the California Public Employees' Retirement System in
the Redding area as of early next year. According to a 2000 report
prepared for the California Healthcare Foundation, the Redding area
had the highest rate of bypass surgeries in California, at 13.55
procedures per 1,000 enrollees -- more than double the statewide
average.</TE>
<TE>   But others in Redding, particularly those supporting the two
doctors, say there are reasons for the high numbers. They say Redding
has a large senior community, including many retired people with a
high incidence of smoking. And there's been a "tremendous influx" of
retirees to the area, said Latimer, the Shasta County official.</TE>
<TE>   Latimer noted that Redding Medical and Mercy Medical, which is
owned by nonprofit Catholic Healthcare West, have contributed
mightily to the region's tax revenues, jobs and philanthropy and also
provide some of the best wages in the region. State figures show that
more than 11% of the Redding payroll workers overall are employed in
the health services area, compared with 7% statewide.</TE>
<TE>   Mercy Medical also has a cardiology department, but the hospital's
profit is just a fraction of Redding Medical's. And some doctors say
a bitter rivalry between the hospitals is behind much of the
criticism against Redding Medical and the two doctors.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been sour grapes," said Dr. Shishir Dhruva, an
anesthesiologist at Redding Medical Center who has worked with Moon
and Realyvasquez. "It's like two hamburger joints on the same street,
and one is selling four times more.... That's what's created this
sort of atmosphere." He added that the higher number of coronary
procedures reflects Redding Medical's early adoption of new
technology.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, for example, Moon is said to have been the first doctor
in Redding, and one of the first in Northern California, to use a
cold laser treatment for unclogging blocked arteries. His apparent
eagerness to be one of the first to master state-of-the-art heart
surgery tools dovetailed with the plans of Redding Medical and Tenet
to establish the facility as one of the premier heart hospitals in
the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Every breakthrough development and Moon's place in being among the
first to use it were chronicled in Redding's hometown newspaper. On
parallel tracks, Tenet's ambitious expansion of Redding Medical
Center continued apace with the creation of the heart institute in
1993, the five-story medical wing in 1995, and an addition in 2002
that expanded the hospital by nearly two-thirds in size.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Redding Medical Center is a thriving medical center with a
strong local marketing campaign replete with billboards,
advertisements and even a "put a little love in your heart" campaign
in 2001. At the entrance, patients and visitors are greeted with free
peppermints and chilled bottled water. A Yamaha player piano plays
softly in the background in the lobby, where the private and
soundproofed patient consultation rooms are located.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency room nurse Richard Caylor had just finished a 12-hour
shift when he was interviewed at the hospital. "We are proud of these
doctors and our reputation as one of the top 190 heart hospitals. I'd
recommend them to anyone. I'd bring my own family here."</TE>
<TE>   Around town, there were plenty of people eager to speak up for
Moon and Realyvasquez.</TE>
<TE>   At the Home Depot in Redding, cashier John Volk, 53, is convinced
that the doctors saved his life last year when Moon advised and
Realyvasquez performed triple bypass surgery.</TE>
<TE>   So is Volk's wife, Mary. She knew that her husband had high blood
pressure, but was not overly concerned about a curious trait of her
husband's, falling asleep in the middle of conversations at family
gatherings.</TE>
<TE>   Both were shocked when Moon gave Volk a test, then announced
brusquely that there was nothing he could do and that immediate
bypass surgery was necessary. Volk had gone in for a routine stress
test and had expected nothing serious, but now he declares himself a
satisfied customer. Volk, a powerfully built, barrel-chested man, is
much more vigorous now -- or "peppy," as his wife describes it.</TE>
<TE>   Just about everyone in town seems to know someone or is related to
someone who was operated on by Moon or Realyvasquez.</TE>
<TE>   Moon, born in Seoul in 1947, has lived in Redding since 1979. He
has been very active in the community, giving free lectures on
medical care and cutting-edge technology, endowing a science
scholarship for Shasta High School graduates and organizing
fund-raisers for the Redding Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really given back to this community," said Redding resident
Betty Prince, 64.</TE>
<TE>   Realyvasquez, born in La Union, Mexico, in 1948, did not move to
the Redding area until 1990, but he more quietly established the
similar tradition of community involvement, most notably donating 50
original Ansel Adams prints to Redding's new Turtle Bay Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to contact Moon and Realyvasquez for this report were
unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   Dugan Barr, a Redding attorney who represents Father John Corapi,
the priest who complained to the FBI about being pressured by Moon to
accept an unnecessary surgery, said he wasn't surprised that the
doctors have so much support.</TE>
<TE>   "These doctors have done a tremendous amount of good, but they
have also done a tremendous amount of unnecessary surgery," Barr
said. "When they weren't busy doing surgeries that needed to be done,
they were busy with surgeries they didn't need to do."</TE>
<TE>   White reported from Redding and Lee from Los Angeles.</TE>

<LD>Prudential Financial Inc. and MetLife Inc. posted higher
third-quarter profits as they boosted sales and cut costs. The
companies were hit by large losses on investment sales, but fared
better than many rivals because of their size and range of products.</LD>
<LD>   Newark, N.J.-based Prudential, the No. 2 U.S. life insurer,
reported profit of $392 million, or 70 cents a share, compared with
$52 million, or 9 cents, last year. Revenue rose 3% to $5.1 billion.</LD>
<LD>   New York-based MetLife, the nation's No. 1 life insurer, posted
profit of $328 million, or 45 cents a share, up from $162 million, or
21 cents, last year, when Sept. 11-related claims cut earnings.
Revenue rose 6% to $8.4 billion.</LD>

<HD>Disney Back in Court on Pooh Rights</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Meg James</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As part of its campaign to secure more rights to the Winnie the Pooh
characters, Walt Disney Co. asked a federal judge in Los Angeles to
recognize the termination of U.S. copyrights held by the British
descendants of the author and illustrator of the Pooh stories.</LD>
<LD>   Disney is locked in a legal battle over Pooh royalties with
Stephen Slesinger Inc., a firm controlled by the family of the late
literary agent who secured rights to Pooh merchandise in the 1930s.
Slesinger's heirs turned over those rights to Disney decades ago for
a share of Pooh merchandise sales.</LD>
<LD>   Disney maintains that it would not owe royalties to the Slesingers
after 2004 if U.S. copyrights were surrendered to the company by
heirs of Pooh author A.A. Milne and Pooh illustrator Ernest Shepard.
On Monday, Disney reached a new agreement with Clare Milne,
granddaughter of A.A. Milne, and Harriet Minette Hunt, granddaughter
of Shepard. "The terms are confidential," said Disney spokesman John
Spelich.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, Disney paid $352 million for the remaining Pooh rights
from various parties in Britain, including Clare Milne. Disney
attorney Daniel Petrocelli said Clare Milne did not transfer her U.S.
copyright to Disney as part of that agreement. "This was an
independent right that she had under U.S. copyright law," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Bert Fields, who represents Slesinger's family, called
the new suit "a devious attempt by Disney to get out of its
obligation to pay royalties that it promised under the 1983
agreement. It's a crazy theory and it's going to backfire."</TE>

<LD>President Bush signed into law a Justice Department appropriations
bill that includes a provision allowing wine purchased at wineries to
be shipped to customers' home states even if those states prohibit
direct shipments of alcohol.</LD>
<LD>   The provision was inserted by a bipartisan group including Sen.
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley).
Although it isn't likely to generate much revenue for California
wineries, it puts Congress on record as supporting direct shipping,
at least in a limited way. Only a few states that prohibit consumers
from carrying wine across their borders will be exempt from the law.</LD>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>International Steel Group Inc., created this year by investor Wilbur
Ross, is considering buying all or part of Bethlehem Steel Corp. in a
bid to gain the biggest share of U.S. steel making capacity.</LD>
<LD>   A full purchase would almost double International Steel's
production capability to 20 million tons a year, giving it control
over about 17% of U.S. steel mills and greater ability to affect
prices. Ross created International Steel by buying assets of LTV
Corp. and has benefited from nonunion labor and U.S. tariffs.</LD>
<LD>   Bethlehem said the U.S. government will take control of its
employee pension fund, using company assets to make payments, after
it struggled to make up for a $6-billion shortfall. The company filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. financial regulators moved to shut down an alleged financial
fraud that may have bilked $3 million from more than 1,000 mostly
African American churches.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission won a temporary restraining
order and asset freeze in federal court in Philadelphia, where at
least 38 of the churches involved in the alleged scheme are located,
against Georgia resident Abraham Kennard and two of his companies,
Network International Investment Corp. and Church Kingdom Investments
Ltd.</LD>
<LD>   From at least January 2001, Kennard organized and attended
religious conferences, leading potential investors in prayer and
worship, then following that with a sales pitch for "church funding
projects," the SEC said.</LD>
<TE>   Kennard's lawyer, Mark Anthony Scott, said he had not had an
opportunity to review the court's order and would not comment until
he had done so.</TE>

<HD>Westside Considering Its Own Visitors Bureau</HD>
<DH>The neighborhood says the L.A. agency has not done enough
to promote its portion of the city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bonnie Harris</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new secession battle is brewing in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Business leaders in West Los Angeles are feeling neglected by the
Los Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau and are considering forming
a separate tourism agency that would market the Westside as a
destination unto itself.</LD>
<LD>   "We're fed up with the lack of attention we're getting here, and
we're losing precious tourism dollars because of it," said Jay
Handal, president of the West L.A. Chamber of Commerce.</LD>
<TE>   The chamber, which has 1,028 members, voted this week to explore
forming a separate visitors bureau for the Westside, saying the LACVB
has not done enough to promote its part of the city and attract
convention business during the persistent travel downturn.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. convention bureau has been criticized in recent months
for wasteful spending and for failing to recover a host of
conventions that has left the city for other regions. Several
downtown hoteliers already have called for the resignation of LACVB
President George Kirkland, blaming mismanagement for much of the
city's tourism problems.</TE>
<TE>   Handal said the bureau also focuses too much on getting visitors
to downtown L.A. rather than the diverse neighborhoods around it, and
believes West L.A. should be marketed as its own destination with
attractions that include the Getty Museum, sports and entertainment
venues at UCLA and the Museum of Tolerance. West L.A. is about the
geographic area from Rancho Park to the Santa Monica border and
Mullholland Drive to Venice Boulevard, according to Handal.</TE>
<TE>   To form a new bureau and pay for its operations, the chamber would
try to claim its portion -- about $3 million -- of the city's hotel
tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "We have more than enough here to make West L.A. a brand name,"
Handal said. "We just need to do what the CVB has been unable or
unwilling to do, and that's market ourselves aggressively. We
certainly can't do any worse than what they're giving us right now."</TE>
<TE>   But some hoteliers and tourism officials say breaking away from
the LACVB would cause even more problems attracting tourists,
including an overlap in marketing efforts and confusion for
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   At the Century Plaza Hotel and Towers, which is the premier
convention and business property on the Westside, general manager
Bill Hall said he does not support a secession from the LACVB and was
unaware of any frustration among area hoteliers and merchants.</TE>
<TE>   "What they're trying to do would be an absolute disaster," Hall
said. "It's always easy to complain when times are bad. But acting so
drastically on something they know so little about is really not a
smart move."</TE>
<TE>   Others said most consumers simply do not understand -- or care --
about the nuances of L.A. neighborhoods, and view everything from
Santa Monica to the Mexican border as being part of the city.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to think about the visitor, and giving visitors
competing messages would be confusing," said Jack Kyser, chief
economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. "To
the rest of the world, L.A. is Beverly Hills and Hollywood and Laguna
and Venice and even Disneyland. Trying to separate West L.A. out from
all of that will amount to nothing more than communication clutter."</TE>
<TE>   LACVB Senior Vice President Michael Collins said he was surprised
by the chamber's action and was unaware of any problems between the
bureau and West L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "I would suspect that the hotels in West L.A. would characterize
our relationship as being pretty good," Collins said. "We've just
never heard from this group before, so I don't really know what to
make of it."</TE>
<TE>   Handal said the chamber voted to form a committee to look into
forming a new visitors bureau and expects a full proposal within 90
days.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom to Adjust Errors to $9 Billion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc. said Tuesday that it expected to restate more than $9
billion in earnings as it faces additional fraud charges from the
Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused the troubled
telecommunications company of misleading investors about its
financial health since at least 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Clinton, Miss.-based WorldCom said it was in talks with the SEC to
settle charges that it committed securities fraud by manipulating its
financial records. A settlement deal -- which would impose a nominal
fine on WorldCom and require the company to agree not to violate
securities laws in the future -- could be announced within a week or
two, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC originally charged WorldCom in June with accounting fraud
that totaled $3.9 billion. Since then, the company has said it
uncovered an additional $3.3 billion in errors and warned that
further adjustments to its financial statements were likely. The
SEC's amended charges cover the additional amount and the expanded
time frame of the accounting irregularities.</LD>
<TE>   Officials from WorldCom and the SEC declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   A settlement would eliminate a major legal problem plaguing
WorldCom, which filed for bankruptcy protection in July. It also
would give it a greater chance of reemerging as a viable company,
legal and financial experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a critical prerequisite for its survival," said James Owers,
professor of finance at Georgia State University and an expert on
corporate restructurings. "If they don't come to terms with the SEC,
then many parties essential to the survival of WorldCom as a workable
entity will not be playing along."</TE>
<TE>   A settlement also would reduce the threat that the company itself
-- rather than just a few former executives -- would be indicted, the
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom still faces shareholder lawsuits and congressional and
Justice Department investigations.</TE>

<HD>For Savers, a Rate Cut Is Unwelcome</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For income-hungry investors, the search for yield could become even
more daunting.</LD>
<LD>   If the Federal Reserve cuts its key interest rate today, as
expected, the move is likely to further depress yields on money
market funds, short-term Treasury debt and bank savings.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not a great time for savers," said James Grant, editor of
the newsletter Grant's Interest Rate Observer in New York. "From the
borrower's point of view, low rates are a windfall. From the saver's
point of view, they're a hazard. Among other things, they lure savers
into taking risks they would otherwise avoid."</LD>
<TE>   Money market mutual fund owners -- and fund managers -- could be
especially hard hit by another Fed cut: With average seven-day money
fund yields at 1.21%, according to rate tracker IMoneyNet Inc., even
a quarter-point Fed cut could mean the average would fall under 1%.</TE>
<TE>   Some funds already pay far less than 1%, after expenses are
deducted. Lower rates on the short-term corporate and government IOUs
the funds buy could mean that more funds would be forced to eat
management expenses to keep their yields from effectively going
negative.</TE>
<TE>   Yields on bank CDs and money market deposit accounts -- which like
money fund returns are at or near record lows -- also would surely
suffer from another Fed cut.</TE>
<TE>   Short-term T-bill yields, which hit 44-year lows Monday, could go
lower, although a quarter-point Fed cut already is "baked into" that
market, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the Fed's key rate at 1.5% -- the expected new level --
would leave many Americans earning virtually nothing on their cash
savings. But with yields already so low, many investors may have
stopped caring about returns on those assets.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you do, put the money under your mattress or my mattress?
At least if you put it under my 'mattress' I pay you," said Bruce R.
Bent, chairman of the New York-based Reserve Funds and a pioneer in
the money fund industry.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, 31 money funds are paying yields at or below 0.25%,
said Peter Crane, editor of Money Fund Report, a publication of
Westborough, Mass.-based IMoneyNet Inc.</TE>
<TE>   If the Fed cuts its rate by a quarter point, about twice as many
money funds would be "flirting with zero" within six weeks as the
effect takes hold, Crane said.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of funds recently have waived expenses to avoid
"breaking the buck," or letting share values drop below $1 (the
equivalent of a negative interest rate), but dozens more might be
forced to make the same move, Crane said.</TE>
<TE>   "Money market funds increasingly are becoming loss leaders for the
industry," said Andrew Clark, senior research analyst at fund tracker
Lipper Inc. in Denver. "That's likely to continue."</TE>
<TE>   Money funds will take any steps necessary to avoid breaking the $1
share level, Bent said, because doing so would harm their image of
stability.</TE>
<TE>   Giant funds with modest expense ratios, such as the $57-billion
Fidelity Cash Reserves, have plenty of room to maneuver, analysts
say.</TE>
<TE>   Retail and institutional investors have been fleeing money market
funds this year, Crane said. Through September, a net $158 billion
came out of the funds, according to the Investment Company Institute,
the industry's main trade group.</TE>
<TE>   Bank CDs and money market deposit accounts haven't offered much of
an alternative, however.</TE>
<TE>   According to Bankrate.com of North Palm Beach, Fla., CDs are
averaging 1.53% for a six-month term, 1.73% for one year and 2.32%
for 2 1/2 years, all record lows since the firm started tracking
rates in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Money market deposit accounts at banks are at a record low average
of 0.95%, Bankrate.com said. Banks typically trim their deposit rates
in line with Fed cuts, depending on how hungry they are for deposits.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "If you're in the stock market looking at a 30% loss, like
some people are, then a 1% return doesn't look so bad," said Karen
Christie, vice president of research at Bankrate.com.</TE>
<TE>   But the danger for both professional money managers and
individuals is that dismal cash savings returns will push more of
them to take on more risk than they can handle, reaching for higher
returns in stocks or longer-term bonds, Grant said.</TE>
<TE>   "Reaching for yield is one of the most dangerous acrobatic stunts
an investor can perform," he said, if the investor isn't prepared for
the risk involved.</TE>

<LD>Western literature -- An article in the Oct. 21 Calendar about the
Western Literature Assn. Conference incorrectly characterized the
source of a quote. UC Santa Cruz professor Forrest Robinson was not
referring to himself but rather was quoting writer Wallace Stegner
when he said, "I was a crybaby, full of self-contempt," and when he
said a spanking from his father left him "dreaming murder."</LD>

<LD>War status -- The review of "Reagan's War" in the Oct. 20 Book Review
stated that Lew Ayres was a conscientious objector in Oregon during
World War II. In fact, Ayres, in addition to being a conscientious
objector in Oregon, served as an Army medic and chaplain's assistant
in the Pacific during WWII. Also, the review incorrectly stated that
Jane Wyman was married to Lew Ayres. Wyman was never married to
Ayres.</LD>

<KH>JOHN BALZAR</KH>
<HD>Heart of Understanding</HD>
<DH>Literature deepens our thinking in a world of sound bites.
On this, dear teachers, surely we can agree.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've taken a drubbing these past few days. If there are folks you
don't want to cross, it's high school English teachers. They were
dismayed about my column that reached back to a popular work of
literature for some thoughts about the U.S. confrontation with Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Even during my worst high school years, I never received such a
string of Fs. But I thank you anyway, dear teachers, even those of
you who want my press card suspended until I complete remedial
tutoring on Joseph Conrad and his novel "Heart of Darkness."</LD>
<LD>   By challenging me on one point, you have reaffirmed a more
important one.</LD>
<TE>   I'll generalize this way: America's public policy debates are too
smug, rigid, cocksure, loud, anticipatory and momentary. Think
Campaign 2002. Or look at what passes for insight on those television
current affairs shows.</TE>
<TE>   Literature reminds us that we are capable of better. And the
reaction of English teachers (and other readers) to my use of Conrad
in a political context demonstrated that when a columnist shoots in
the dark, he sometimes hits upon something.</TE>
<TE>   In my previous meditation on the showdown with Iraq, I pondered
the strange way we compartmentalize our lives. Literature is rich
with human uncertainty and contradiction; shades of gray, if you
will. By contrast, our political discussions are black and white and
stridently so. I revisited "Heart of Darkness" because it was a story
of danger and moral introspection, a tale of "the impossibility of
innocence," as one critic said. It seemed fitting for the mood of the
moment.</TE>
<TE>   English teachers insisted that I had misread Conrad. Since this
100-year-old story of the ivory trade in West Africa was
anti-colonialist, they believed I could only conclude that the U.S.
had no business interfering with Saddam Hussein today. Since I had
argued otherwise, I was awarded the dunce cap.</TE>
<TE>   Nonsense. "Heart of Darkness" should not be used as a literal cue
card for policy decisions. If we adhere to that logic, we could find
ourselves rolling the clock back on civil rights, because Conrad
beheld the world from a racist vantage.</TE>
<TE>   There are far better contemporary books at hand to help us analyze
the contemporary Middle East, terrorism, Islam, Western culture and
so forth.</TE>
<TE>   So what is the role of literature in a democracy? My encounter
with these same English teachers persuaded me that it has a place,
and it's neither gathering dust on the bookshelves nor as an
after-hours pleasure apart from our public lives.</TE>
<TE>   Ernest Hemingway wrote about "the underwater part of the iceberg"
-- the wisdom and experience that a writer brings to a work but is
left unstated or submerged, to support the small portion that is
visible. Likewise, readers bring the ballast of their own experiences
and sensibilities. The result ends up with a lot of grinding below
the waterline, which is why encounters with literature are of the
order of experience. It is the original interactive medium.</TE>
<TE>   You don't have to be stuffy about it, but a challenging book
refutes all that is wrong with television and TV-driven public
affairs. Just the effort of reading such a book recalibrates our
perspectives, just as a stroll through a quiet forest invites
reflection in ways that speeding by in a car cannot. At the very
least, a preparatory dose of good literature before we speak our
minds might restore some depth and add a touch of grace to our civic
disagreements.</TE>
<TE>   "Literature exists for the sake of the people -- to refresh the
weary, to console the sad, to hearten the dull and downcast, to
increase man's interest in the world, his joy of living and his
sympathy in all sorts and conditions of man," wrote Judge Martin
Manton, defending the novel "Ulysses" against its banning in 1934.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-eight years later, the judge's words remind us of the very
things that go wanting in our public dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   I wish I'd gotten a better grade from the English teachers this
time around. But my appreciation for them is nonetheless sincere.
Many are regrettably being uprooted and transformed into
"communications" instructors or some other faddishness. The
remainder, those who teach, defend and argue "Heart of Darkness" and
other good books, carry the challenge forward to a new generation.</TE>
<TE>   "Literature," said Ezra Pound, "is news that stays news."</TE>

<HD>China's 'Local Freedoms'</HD>
<DH>Incoming leaders are open to easing some restrictions --
but not at a level where party power can be challenged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew J. Nathan</AU>
<BD>Andrew J. Nathan is a professor of political science at
Columbia University and co-author, with Bruce Gilley, of "China's New
Rulers: The Secret Files," to be published Friday by New York Review
Books.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>China's authoritarian regime, which pervasively represses human
rights and resists democratic reforms, nonetheless is in robust shape
as it enters into its leadership transition at the meeting of its
ruling Chinese Communist Party that opens Friday.</LD>
<LD>   This is surprising to many China observers. After all, the
regime's ideology is bankrupt. The transition from a socialist to a
quasi-market economy has created social unrest. The regime relies
heavily on coercion to repress religious and political dissent.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the regime commands considerable acceptance among China's 1.3
billion people. In a 1993 nationwide random sample survey, Duke
University professor Tianjian Shi found that 94% of respondents
agreed or strongly agreed with the statement, "We should trust and
obey the government, for in the last analysis it serves our
interests." A 2002 survey by Shi also found high percentages of
respondents expressing confidence in the ruling Chinese Communist
Party.</LD>
<TE>   Why would citizens in a nondemocratic regime have so much faith in
their rulers? One reason is that most people's living standards have
risen during two decades of economic growth. Although China still has
some big pockets of poverty and more than 100 million hard-pressed
migrant workers, several hundred million citizens along the southern
and eastern coasts live comfortably with all the cosmopolitan
benefits of fast food, cell phones and modern department stores.</TE>
<TE>   The party has co-opted elites by offering membership to successful
people in all walks of life and by granting informal property-rights
protection to entrepreneurs. This new policy direction was given
ideological grounding in President Jiang Zemin's theory of the "three
represents," which says that the party should represent advanced
productive forces, advanced culture and the basic interests of all
the Chinese working people -- that is, that it should represent the
middle classes as much as, or more than, the workers and peasants.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese people traditionally favor stability. After going through
the Cultural Revolution and the era of reform, most prefer the
political order they know, whatever its faults, to potential
breakdown.</TE>
<TE>   Resentment against the ruling party did boil over in the 1989
pro-democracy demonstrations. But after putting those demonstrations
down by force, the government propaganda machine was able to use the
example of post-Communist chaos in Russia to persuade many Chinese
that political reform could be dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, the regime has created a series of limited yet
effective input institutions that allow citizens to believe that they
have some influence on local policy:</TE>
<TE>   * The Administrative Litigation Act of 1989 allows citizens to sue
government agencies. Although the number of such suits is relatively
small -- according to Minxin Pei of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace in Washington, there were 98,600 in 1999 -- it
does constitute an alternative channel for popular dissatisfaction.
The success rate (court victories plus favorable settlements) has
ranged from 27% to about 40%. In at least one province, the
government offers a legal aid program so the poor can take advantage
of this program.</TE>
<TE>   * "Letters and visits" departments throughout China serve as
institutional ombudsmen.</TE>
<TE>   * Both people's congresses (legislative bodies) and people's
political consultative conferences (advisory groups that connect the
government to non-Communist sections of the population) have grown
more independent.</TE>
<TE>   * As the mass media have become more independent and
market-driven, they have increasingly positioned themselves as
tribunes of the people, exposing complaints against wrongdoing by
local officials.</TE>
<TE>   As representative as they seem, these channels of demand- and
complaint-making have two common features that keep China far short
of real democracy. They encourage individual rather than group-based
efforts, such as from unions, which the party fears for their
potential to challenge its rule. And they focus complaints only
against local agencies or officials.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the party leaders who are about to come to office are
willing to expand electoral competition and media latitude at the
local level. They are not, however, going to allow anything at a
regional or national level that might undermine the party's monopoly
on power.</TE>

<HD>A Potent Portent in Political Prediction</HD>
<DH>Without a crystal ball, pundits are shattered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Crispin Sartwell</AU>
<BD>Crispin Sartwell teaches philosophy at the Maryland
Institute College of Art.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deep in our history, before electronic communication, news sometimes
arrived too late, as when Andrew Jackson and his men killed 2,000
British troops at New Orleans on Jan. 8, 1815, two weeks after the
Treaty of Ghent "ended" the war they were fighting. But ever since
Dewey defeated Truman, it has been the habit of news to arrive too
soon, whether by a few hours or a few days.</LD>
<LD>   Commonly, though, through the necromancy we call "science,"
elections are called months in advance, making the participation of
actual voters strictly futile. That's why it was just a tad
refreshing Tuesday when the Voter News Service, a consortium
assembled by five television networks and the Associated Press --
with subscribers including such news organizations as the Washington
Post and the New York Times -- declared its exit polling procedures
hopelessly flawed and forced everyone to rely, more or less, on
actual vote counts.</LD>
<LD>   Burned by the 2000 debacle in Florida -- during which almost
everyone projected Florida wrongly, repeatedly, for Al Gore -- the
Voter News Service choked in 2002, while the cable news operations
competed to portray themselves as the most cautious prognosticators.</LD>
<TE>   It is a disconcerting fact that the saturation coverage of
elections had become utterly dependent on the ability of social
scientists to divine the future, taking over the tasks previously
performed by analyzing flocks of crows and the entrails of animals.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it is reassuring that we're not as predictable as some folks
might have hoped, and that we're still strange creatures, a bit
inexplicable even to one another.</TE>
<TE>   It has sometimes seemed that we've gotten to the point at which
actually making decisions was unnecessary: To within a slight margin
of error, the statisticians always knew what we were going to do.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, writing the history of the future on tablets of stone
seemed to be the main function of political coverage in the media.</TE>
<TE>   Yet if there's one thing that might be concluded scientifically
from the history of science itself, it is that when we answer our
questions, the answers always raise more and harder questions.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps we might even have reached the point at which we could
vote out of sheer perversity, merely to irritate the pollsters and
their media representatives, merely to demonstrate our freedom by
sheer cussedness.</TE>
<TE>   When the great Jesse Ventura threatened to replace the late Sen.
Paul Wellstone with a trash collector, he was expressing his
frustration with the predictability of politics, the extent of its
regularization and control. And when, on election day, Ventura said
the difference between elections in the United States and elections
in Iraq was that Americans got exactly one more choice, he was doing
likewise.</TE>
<TE>   Some folks might hope that the factors that go into human
decisions would become so clear and so few that they could be treated
as variables in an equation predicting their actions. Some folks, in
other words, would hope that freedom amounted to a rationally
determined choice between exactly two alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, the situation down here on Earth is messy and
complicated -- so messy and complicated indeed that we often have no
idea what we ourselves, much less everyone else, is going to do.</TE>
<TE>   That's one reason we actually vote: because we can't, in fact,
tell the future or write its history. And that's why it's a good
thing that the pollsters are choking in the clutch.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours might be too long to wait for news of peace. But it's
not too long to wait for news of the composition of the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, sometimes I think if I never hear, it would be too soon.</TE>

<DH>Service personnel should have more freedom to sue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Turley</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington
University, recently completed a study of the Feres Doctrine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Nothing is too good for our men and women in uniform."</LD>
<LD>   It may be the world's most predictable political applause line. It
was a central theme of President Bush's 2000 presidential campaign.
With both war and elections looming, it became a virtual mantra among
politicians across the country.</LD>
<LD>   This month, however, the Bush administration is waging a
little-known battle to preserve a rule that reduces service members
to second-class citizens.</LD>
<TE>   The Feres Doctrine is a legal rule that bars service members and
their families from suing the government for even the most horrendous
acts of negligence and abuse. Because of this obscure rule, service
members have become fodder for medical malpractice and other forms of
negligence in the military. In one case, an Army doctor left a
30-by-18-inch towel inside a soldier; it was discovered 18 months
after the surgery. The Supreme Court said a suit would threaten
military decision making.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, military decisions include refusals to respond at all.
In another case, an Army sergeant's wife spent a day begging military
doctors to admit her husband, who was biting his tongue and having
convulsions after he was sent home "to rest." She finally took him to
a civilian hospital, which immediately diagnosed grand mal seizures.
The sergeant died; his family's lawsuit was barred.</TE>
<TE>   In yet another case, a bar on an Army reservation in Kansas did
nothing while a soldier was beaten almost to death by a gang. Though
a civilian bar would have faced substantial liability, the soldier's
lawsuit against the military was dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Some cases make the second-class status of service members
appallingly clear. There are examples in which an off-duty service
member was with a civilian when both were injured by an act of gross
military negligence; the civilian could claim damages but the service
member could not.</TE>
<TE>   This is not what Congress intended. In 1946, when Congress enacted
the Federal Tort Claims Act, it expressly exempted only
combat-related military lawsuits. The Supreme Court, however, ignored
this language in deciding the Feres case in 1950 and barred lawsuits
with no connection to combat areas.</TE>
<TE>   Even intentional acts of brutality have been protected as matters
of military discretion. In one case, a service member was subject to
"hazing" by being sexually assaulted with a traffic cone while being
photographed in public. Despite what the court called the
"despicable" nature of this attack and a pattern of such attacks at
the base where the incident occurred, the court found it
"service-connected" and therefore barred the claim under Feres.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, John Walker Lindh has more legal protection than the
service members who helped capture him in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Congress can remedy this injustice and return to its original
intent of exempting only combat-connected injuries from lawsuit. As
our service members prepare for possible war in Iraq, there is no
better time to guarantee equality for them and their families.</TE>
<TE>   If there is nothing too good for our men and women in uniform, the
Bush administration could start by supporting them in the fight
against Feres. It is not campaign rhetoric that they need; it is
equal rights.</TE>

<HD>The Victor's Fiscal Hell</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Congratulations on your victory, Mr. Governor-elect, and welcome to
fiscal hell. Now start making millions of Californians angry by
raising taxes and fees and cutting programs that benefit them.</LD>
<LD>   That's the unhappy picture the election winner faces this morning.
The desk groans under long-term problems that plague California. The
state needs billions for transportation, additional water sources,
new schools and other forms of infrastructure to serve a booming
population. It also must provide adequate health care for all
Californians and make public education better. The list goes on.</LD>
<LD>   But the budget shortfall -- by far the biggest in state history --
looms as a giant thundercloud over everything else. Anything that
involves new state spending has to wait until California brings this
fiscal mess under control. The man in the governor's office will need
to address the problem immediately. By the time he is sworn in during
the first week of January, his budget for 2003-04 already will have a
potential deficit of $10 billion. It may be worse than that if the
fiscal tricks employed to offset this year's $24-billion deficit
don't work. It's apparent now that some will not.</LD>
<TE>   Before he decided to run for governor in 1990, Republican Pete
Wilson debated with his advisors whether California was even capable
of being governed. And that was before recession set in the next
year, followed by a string of natural disasters.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, Gray Davis took office with a roaring economy
pouring billions in new tax collections into the state treasury.
Today, conditions are far worse.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans blame Davis. But there is plenty of blame to be
shared. Surely Davis failed to react quickly and dramatically enough
to the sudden falloff of tax collections, but he didn't cause it. He
tried to raise taxes by rolling back the car tax cuts of 1999, but
Republicans refused to agree to any tax increase. Democrats are
responsible for pushing through expanded spending and refusing to
accept some of the budget cuts Davis wanted.</TE>
<TE>   That pattern of deadlock must be abandoned if the state is to
begin working itself out of its fiscal hole in the coming year. Alas,
Assembly GOP leader Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks) says Republicans will
stick with their no-tax vow. One can hope that was election campaign
rhetoric. One possibility is to temporarily raise the state income
tax on the wealthiest Californians, as was done in the 1990s.
Unfortunately, there is no possibility of solving the fiscal crisis
with budget cuts alone without devastating health and public safety
programs. This crisis must be dealt with cooperatively. As there was
in the early 1990s, there is a need for some tax increases balanced
by budget cuts.</TE>
<TE>   The governor-elect should begin today to build the foundation for
a constructive budget compromise, consulting with both Democratic and
Republican leaders. The state muddled through this year, after a
record-long budget impasse, with a contorted fiscal plan rigged with
string, duct tape and illusion. California cannot afford to do that
again.</TE>

<HD>Health System Needs a Hero</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tom Scully is a reluctant hero. The Bush administration's health
honcho is scheduled to visit Harbor-UCLA Medical Center today but has
shown little interest in saving Los Angeles County's imploding
health-care system. The Clinton administration bailed the county out
twice, but Scully works for a Republican president who neither owes
nor expects favors from a heavily Democratic county.</LD>
<LD>   Besides, Democratic and Republican campaigns alike avoided
health-care reform as too demanding, even as Tuesday's election fell
during open-enrollment season for many company health plans. Today
the lucky politicians are out partying and the lucky voters are back
to figuring out which services their soaring premiums will still buy.
The unlucky ones -- an estimated 40 million Americans -- don't get to
gripe about their employer-sponsored medical insurance because their
employers don't offer any.</LD>
<LD>   With its burgeoning immigrant population, Los Angeles County leads
the nation in uninsured residents. This is the root of its
health-care crisis. Small companies, service industry jobs and
sweatshops support a vast population that makes too little to pay for
individual insurance but too much to qualify for public programs like
Medicaid.</LD>
<TE>   The United States relies on employer-sponsored insurance to cover
medical costs, and that works in Wisconsin, where just 20% of
residents are not covered. But what passes for a national policy on
health care doesn't work in California, where, according to a 2002
Urban Institute report, 40% of residents lack employer-sponsored
insurance. Los Angeles County hospitals, which treat residents
regardless of their ability to pay, are overwhelmed.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors, desperate to close a staggering
systemwide deficit, will decide this month whether to close
Harbor-UCLA. Scully has argued that to give Los Angeles County
additional money would be unfair to states other than California. It
would be -- if other states faced the same need. They don't.</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty of sound political reasons for a Republican
administration to help Los Angeles County's uninsured. An
administration committed to homeland defense must recognize that the
nation's second-largest city is a possible terrorist target -- and
that the county's emergency-care and public health system form the
backbone of response. And a Republican Party that in California is
seeking to expand its base should be savvy enough to see that many of
the low-income workers affected by county health-care cuts are in a
coveted, growing group of voters -- Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. County needs heroic action from Washington: First, the
literally lifesaving money it can provide if it wants to. Then, new
thinking on how to meet the health needs of this and other growing
states.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush needs to move quickly to restore the Securities and
Exchange Commission's tattered credibility now that Chairman Harvey
L. Pitt has finally resigned under pressure. Pitt made a mockery of
the agency. Whom Bush selects as Pitt's successor will signal loudly
whether the president is serious about policing corporate
malfeasance.</LD>
<LD>   An angry White House thinks it has been compromised by Pitt's
failure to disclose that former FBI and CIA Director William H.
Webster, chairman of the government's new accounting industry
oversight board, had been on an audit committee of U.S. Technologies,
a company facing civil lawsuits alleging fraud.</LD>
<LD>   However, the problems exposed in Pitt's tenure run deeper than
merely bungling relations with the White House.</LD>
<TE>   Pitt hurt the SEC's morale by failing to move aggressively against
corporate crime, thus allowing New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer and
other state attorneys general to seize the initiative. And Pitt
failed to fight administration attempts to renege on increased
funding for his agency, money that would help pay for desperately
needed investigators, prosecutors and auditors.</TE>
<TE>   Part of Pitt's legacy is, as Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) has
noted, that the appointment process for the new audit committee "is
now tainted." Before Pitt's resignation Tuesday night, investigations
into the SEC chairman's handling of the Webster appointment were
looming; one of them, incredibly, Pitt himself had called for.</TE>
<TE>   The White House needs to clean up the SEC now rather than waiting
for Congress to act. With Pitt gone, the White House should ensure
that Webster steps down because of the fierce controversy surrounding
his murky corporate record.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, the administration needs to appoint as Pitt's
replacement someone like former Sen. Warren Rudman, who commands the
kind of respect and integrity that can turn the SEC around. Some of
the names being floated --   such as James Doty, a Bush family friend
who was chief counsel of the SEC when it investigated George W. Bush
for insider trading at Harken Energy and cleared him -- only compound
cynicism about the troubled agency.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing worse than having Pitt in office would be
appointing a more politically savvy version of him. To help restore
confidence in financial markets, the administration must start with
an SEC chairman who believes in the agency's mission to discover and
prosecute corporate crime.</TE>

<LD>Re "Allies Find No Links Between Iraq, Al Qaeda," Nov. 4:</LD>
<LD>   While the security services of Western European nations
successfully discover, arrest, prosecute and imprison terrorists, the
total U.S. product after 14 months of intensive bumbling by domestic
intelligence agencies is one man awaiting trial and an undisclosed
number of brown-skinned people deported. Meanwhile, our president and
his chicken hawk associates continue to insist that there are close
ties between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda, despite the absence of
evidence and in the face of denial by the security forces of our
allies of any known linkage.</LD>
<LD>   In my 80 years of life we have had good presidents and bad but
none who deliberately set a path for war with no purpose but to gain
political advantage or, perhaps, control of petroleum resources, an
act that we once dared to call imperialism. For shame that this great
nation has fallen into the hands of the inept, the unknowing, the
greedy and the heartless and is led by the least competent occupant
of the White House since Warren Harding, if not Millard Fillmore.</LD>

<TE>   Professor Fawaz Gerges states that the White House should avoid
war with Iraq and instead use creative strategies to decrease the
pool of recruits for militant Islam and its terrorism ("Hearts, Minds
and Terror," Commentary, Oct. 31). However, he ignores that these
recruits are the result of self-interested manipulation by various
groups in Arab society that divert attention away from corruption by
blaming these and other failures on the United States. This
manipulation is coupled with Islamic religious instruction by clerics
and leaders like Osama bin Laden who teach war and martyrdom.</TE>
<TE>   In this light, what are America's misdeeds? Surely not the
$2-billion annual aid to Egypt, the defense of Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia in the Gulf War or President Clinton's Camp David peace
proposals to the Israelis and Palestinians. Gerges asks for policy
changes and appeasement. What he should seek is for Arab leaders to
promote civil reform and reject those in their societies who are at
war with the West.</TE>

<LD>Regarding Robert Eisenman's concern for the stone ossuary bearing
Jesus' name being "too pat, too perfect" (Commentary, Oct. 29): It
doesn't matter to believers. Believers know that salvation and truth
rest on another stone; namely Jesus, the rock of our salvation. If it
is true, then it is confirmation of what we already know, and if not,
then it is just more diversion from the devil.</LD>

<LD>It's odd that The Times, which worked long and hard to achieve and

<TE>   Re "Microsoft Wins Major Points in Antitrust Settlement Ruling,"
Nov. 2: A monopoly is impossible in a free market. Microsoft has
cornered the software market because Bill Gates was a visionary who
revolutionized not just computer software but the way we conduct
business. His software allowed computing to be mass-marketed,
affordable and reliable. Antitrust laws are un-American in that they
penalize ability and success. Gates should be honored and revered,
not vilified and scorned. Ayn Rand wrote that the consequence of
antitrust is the "sacrifice of productive genius to the demands of
envious mediocrity."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "The Great Divide" (Opinion, Nov. 3) you published two pieces on
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by two Israelis. Where was the
Palestinian viewpoint?</LD>
<LD>   Israel's brutal and illegal 35-year occupation is the source of
the violence between the two countries. The Israelis are stealing
Palestinian land and water. Ehud Barak's "generous offer" was nothing
more than a series of Bantustans in which the Palestinians would live
surrounded by Israeli troops and settlers.</LD>
<LD>   As an American Jew, I support the struggle of the Palestinians for
liberation, whether in their own state or as equal citizens in one
democratic secular state alongside Israeli Jews.</LD>
<TE>   There is no hope as long as an unjust Israeli state forever
oppresses the Palestinians. Hope lies in the end of the occupation
and the establishment of full and equal rights for everyone who lives
in Palestine and Israel.</TE>

<TE>   "The Great Divide" says more about the Middle East than The Times
realizes. Each writer ignores the assassination of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin by an Israeli fundamentalist seven years ago. This is
what triggered the unraveling of the peace process.</TE>
<TE>   The real "great divide" lies within both Israel and the West Bank,
between those willing to return to the pre-1967 borders and those
willing to oppose such agreements violently.</TE>

<TE>   David Grossman suggests that Israel being concerned only with its
security is something negative. In addition, I have to question his
sincerity when he suggests that Ariel Sharon was the cause of the
present intifada. It has been acknowledged that Yasser Arafat came
back from Camp David with the plan to use terrorism to leverage
better terms. In regard to making concessions and to offering
contiguous land to the Palestinians, the Israelis offered numerous
concessions and Arafat made none.</TE>
<TE>   Grossman's suggestion that Israel has been "repressing" the
Palestinians is another example of his twisting the facts. Israel is
no different from any other country.</TE>
<TE>   When the sniper was murdering civilians in the Washington area,
our government closed down roads with checkpoints and cordoned off
areas in much the same way.</TE>
<TE>   When Israel, under pressure from the U.S., took the checkpoints
off Jenin, within 24 hours Israel civilians were being blown up by
terrorists again. Israel has been responsible for building colleges,
schools, hospitals and infrastructure including sewers and
electricity for the Palestinians. To suggest that Israel is without
compassion or concern for the plight of the Palestinians is
disingenuous and untrue.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Comforting Spouse Could Turn Out to Be a Real Pain," Nov. 4:
Someone please tell me how many thousands of dollars went into this
ridiculous research project. Apparently, our neuroscientists needed
conclusive evidence that the spouse who coddles, babies and mollifies
his or her significant other might be worsening or prolonging the
condition.</LD>
<LD>   I wonder how this analysis was made. I can just see the project
specs now: During successive "Monday Night Football" games, spouse A
developed a spontaneous, crippling leg cramp when asked to take out
the garbage by spouse B. Those spouse Bs who acceded the point found
no garbage was dispatched outdoors for approximately 3.5 hours, or
four quarters of the game. Those spouse Bs who shut off the TV and
kicked spouse A's leg for verification of falsehood found garbage
promptly outdoors. Project results? Thousands of American dollars out
the window; game over.</LD>

<LD>I work as a traffic officer for the L.A. Department of
Transportation. On Halloween I was directing traffic at Las Palmas
and Selma. I watched several families walk by me with the look of
disappointment on their faces because they could not afford the entry
fee to the fenced-off carnival. The city of Los Angeles was basically
telling them that if you cannot afford the $10 to enter, then we
don't want you.</LD>
<LD>   I felt very sad for these families, many of whom parked and walked
for several blocks only to find they had to pay to enter. Perhaps the
city will take down the fence next year and let everyone join in the
festivities.</LD>

beyond his personal vendetta against Cardinal Roger Mahony, he might
see the real issue surrounding the diocese staff cuts. The problem
could be solved and the staff rehired if every Catholic in the
archdiocese of L.A. gave an extra $1.50. Catholics need to
financially support their church and quit blaming the cardinal for
balancing the budget.</LD>

<HD>Past Votes Show That California Isn't Liberal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "A State of Change: California's Tilt Toward the Left," Opinion,
Nov. 3:</LD>
<LD>   I seriously question Harold Meyerson's idea that California is a
left-leaning state. After all, California voters have affirmed the
death penalty, voted to make English the official language, voted to
eliminate publicly funded benefits for illegal immigrants, moved
against affirmative action and prohibited gay marriage. Oh, yeah,
don't forget voters also threw out of office Chief Justice Rose Bird
and two other liberal justices. These can hardly be considered a
series of flukes but instead represent a long-term trend of
conservative values among Californians.</LD>
<LD>   But Meyerson did get one aspect correct: The two most conservative
presidents of the 20th century (Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan) did
come out of his "liberal" California. Gov. Gray Davis, for all the
millions he spent, couldn't get more than 10 points ahead of Bill
Simon in preelection opinion polls. If the Republicans had fielded a
stronger candidate in this election, chances are Davis would have
been 10 points behind him, and the entire Republican ticket would
have fared much better.</LD>
<TE>   Larry Shulman</TE>
<TE>   Northridge</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One question, please, to Meyerson, whose silly column displays how
much he hates the Bible Belt (where men tote guns) and loves what the
liberals are doing in California. What happens, sir, when these
liberals drive all the major businesses out of the state with their
regulations?</TE>

<HD>Brian Behan, 75; Irish Writer Thrived on Controversy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brian Behan, the colorful, contentious Irish writer and younger
brother of the noted dramatist Brendan Behan, died of a heart attack
Saturday in the southern English city of Brighton, where he had lived
for many years. He was 75.</LD>
<LD>   An eccentric figure, Behan swam nude every day off the Brighton
coast; in December 1999, an onlooker mistook his behavior for a
suicide attempt and alerted authorities, who mounted an air-sea
rescue.</LD>
<LD>   He was not close to Brendan -- who once derided Brian's plans to
write a memoir with the words, "You could get that fellow's memoirs
on the back of a postage stamp and still have room for the Koran" --
or another brother, Dominic, who didn't speak to him for 34 years.</LD>
<TE>   His biggest success was in 1984 with Peter Sheridan's dramatic
adaptation of Behan's novel "Mother of All the Behans," about his
mother, Kathleen. A flamboyant figure, she acted as a courier for the
rebels James Connolly and Padraig Pearse during the ill-fated 1916
Easter Rising against British rule in Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   His first play, "Boots for the Footless," attracted pickets
outside a London theater from Irish groups protesting its
stereotypical portrayal of drunken, violent Irishmen and
contradictory, conniving Irishwomen.</TE>
<TE>   Behan was unrepentant, describing his play as an autobiographical
work that spared no member of his family -- from Brendan, whom he
portrayed as "a Republican rebel with 1,000 causes," to his father,
"who used the pub as a form of contraception for 40 years."</TE>
<TE>   "I poke fun at us all," he told the London newspaper The
Independent, "because if you take yourself too seriously, it kills
you. That's what Brendan died of -- an overdose of self."</TE>
<TE>   He did not avoid other controversial themes: his play "The
Begrudgers," set in postwar Dublin, explored the literary rivalry
between Brendan Behan and fellow writers Brian O'Nolan (who used the
pen name Flann O'Brien) and Patrick Kavanagh.</TE>
<TE>   His satirical play "Hallelujah I'm a Bum" (1995), about a British
prime minister having a homosexual relationship with one of his
ministers, aroused further controversy.</TE>
<TE>   His also wrote two novels, "Time To Go" (1979), and "Kathleen"
(1988), again inspired by his mother.</TE>
<TE>   Behan grew up in a north Dublin slum and as a youth was often in
trouble. A court ordered him to attend an industrial school run by
the Christian Brothers, where he said he was sexually abused.</TE>
<TE>   After school he served in the Irish Army Construction Corps. With
work scarce in Dublin, he moved in 1950 to London, where he
eventually worked as a bricklayer, carpenter, hod carrier and
dockworker. His 1964 autobiography, "With Breast Expanded," described
England, where many Irish worked in construction, as the land of "big
money and small shovels."</TE>
<TE>   He became an active trade unionist, whose campaigning resulted in
brief prison sentences in 1951 and 1958.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the British Communist Party, became an executive member
and met Soviet dictator Josef Stalin and Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung
on a party tour, but quit the party after the Soviet suppression of
the Hungarian uprising in 1956.</TE>
<TE>   He then joined the Socialist Labor League, a Trotskyite group, but
was eventually expelled for "deviationism." The Anarchists also threw
him out when he demanded to know who owned them.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, Behan studied history and English at Sussex
University in southern England. From 1973 to 1990, he lectured in
media studies at the London College of Printing.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by three daughters from his first marriage and a
son and daughter by his second marriage, to artist Sally Hill, who
died two years ago.</TE>

<HD>Barbara Berjer, 82; Popular Soap Opera Star Had TV Career
Spanning 4 Decades</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barbara Berjer, grande dame of television soap operas for four
decades, including memorable roles on "As the World Turns" and
"Another World," has died. She was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Berjer, who had lived for the last year in her native Seattle,
died Oct. 20 of pneumonia while on a trip to New York City.</LD>
<LD>   For more than 12 years, Berjer was the elderly wisdom-dispensing
Bridget Connell on "Another World."</LD>
<TE>   She became so popular that, when writers had her character die in
1996, fans became enraged, forcing "Bridget" to reappear on
subsequent episodes as a ghost.</TE>
<TE>   Berjer also played the much-married Claire English Lowell Cassen
Shea on "As the World Turns" from 1965 until that character was
killed off in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Her other indelible role was as Barbara Norris Thorpe on "The
Guiding Light" from 1971 to 1981, with more appearances in 1989 and
1995-96.</TE>
<TE>   Berjer also worked in the soaps "From These Roots" in the late
1960s and "The Edge of Night" in the mid-1960s.</TE>
<TE>   The daytime dramas came naturally to the stage-experienced actress
because in the early days they were telecast live. She viewed the
work as performing in a daily play.</TE>
<TE>   Berjer, who changed the original spelling of her name, Berger, to
indicate the correct pronunciation, studied drama at the University
of Washington and then worked briefly in Seattle children's theater.</TE>
<TE>   She moved to New York, where she remained most of her life, to
work in live theater. Among her credits was the 1960 Broadway hit
"The Best Man," written by Gore Vidal and based on John F. Kennedy's
presidential election campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Berjer played a reporter in the show, which ran for 520
performances.</TE>
<TE>   Berjer also co-starred on Broadway with Alec Guinness in "Dylan,"
a play about poet Dylan Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   In her later years, Berjer coached other actors, including Anne
Heche, and had roles on such television series as "Law and Order."</TE>
<TE>   She was married to the late choreographer Lee Foley and is
survived by their son, Thomas Michael Foley of Manhattan.</TE>

<LD>Lionel Poilane, the French bread baker who shipped his 4-pound
sourdough loaves by overnight express to specialty grocers and
restaurants around the world, and once baked a set of bread furniture
for his artist friend Salvador Dali, has died. He was 57.</LD>
<LD>   Last Thursday, he and his wife, Ibu, were on their way home to the
island of Remaine when their helicopter went down in heavy fog off
the northern coast of France. They are survived by two children.</LD>
<LD>   His Paris bakery on the Rue Cherche Midi in the artsy St. Germain
des Pres district has attracted waiting lines outside the door for
three decades. The signature loaf -- a large, round "Pain Poilane" --
sells by weight for about $6 a pound.</LD>
<TE>   From the time Poilane took over the family business in the early
1970s, he worked to restore the handmade French bread baking
tradition. His round boule was his alternative to the baguette, the
long narrow sticks of bread that he refused to carry in his shop.
They are not authentic, he often pointed out; they were introduced to
France by an Austrian ambassador in the mid-19th century.</TE>
<TE>   Poilane was born in Paris into a family of bread bakers and left
school at 14 to apprentice in his father's shop. It had been the site
of a monastery in the 18th century, and the bread ovens were from
that era. For the next 10 years, Poilane spent his days in the hot
cellar beside the cave-shaped baking alcove.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, his friend Dali, the surrealist artist, commissioned
Poilane to bake a bread bird cage. It stirred old memories. "When I
started as an apprentice, I was a very bitter boy stuck down in the
basement with the bread," Poilane said. "The bird could eat its way
out of the cage. That was very real to me. As an apprentice, I too
felt like a bird in a cage."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the frustrations of apprenticeship, Poilane was captured
by the idea of perfecting a sourdough bread made of stone-ground
flour, water, bran and salt in the ancient manner. Since the end of
World War II in France, mass produced items were replacing artisanal
breads and baked goods. Poilane and his father considered it a point
of family pride to preserve the traditional fresh loaf.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when he took over the business, Poilane interviewed
thousands of French bakers about historic techniques and tasted close
to 100 traditional recipes he had never tried. He also amassed a
collection of about 2,000 books on bread and began to describe
himself as "the archeologist of my trade."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles bread baker Nancy Silverton of the La Brea Bakery
first visited Poilane's Paris shop 20 years ago. "Rustic bread sold
by weight not by the loaf -- I'd never seen anything like it," she
said Tuesday. "Every baker I know who specializes in handmade bread
was inspired by Poilane."</TE>
<TE>   Friends who visited the wood-fired ovens below the shop came home
from the hot cellar with stories to tell, Silverton recalled. "The
bakers worked in their underwear."</TE>
<TE>   At Balducci's specialty grocers in New York City, Claude
Mallinger, a longtime friend of Poilane, said some of his customers
now request a phone call when a delivery has arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "Lionel was a very reliable person," Mallinger said Tuesday. "He
appreciated the people he did business with, and he was the sort of
friend who would never forget you."</TE>
<TE>   About 5,000 loaves per week are shipped to U.S. businesses, most
of them in New York and California. Bristol Farms is one outlet in
Southern California that carries the bread. "People know the name,
from their travels in France," said Pete Hejny, a store executive.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1980s, Poilane was receiving requests to ship his
product abroad but could not accommodate additional orders. Eager to
expand his business, he built a bread factory south of Paris that
avoided assembly lines and mass production. He installed 24
wood-burning brick ovens, identical to the original in the Paris
shop.</TE>
<TE>   As his reputation grew, Poilane became a recognized figure in
Paris. He was the baker who in-line skated to work, some days wearing
a winged silver cap on his head. In his office a bread chandelier
lighted the room that was filled with artist's renditions of
Poilane's beloved country loaf. His celebrity client list grew, from
Catherine Deneuve and Robert De Niro to French President Giscard
d'Estaigne.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Poilane opened a shop in London, complete with
his trademark brick oven, and refused an offer to open in Tokyo
because he would not be permitted to install the oven there.</TE>
<TE>   Grudgingly, he added a few popular items to his bakery shelves.
Walnut bread, apple tarts and butter cookies are now options for
customers who shop via Internet from around the world.</TE>

<HD>Keith Wester, 62; Sound Engineer Won Emmy, Nominated for
Oscars</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Keith A. Wester, Emmy-winning and multiple Oscar-nominated production
sound mixer, whose work included such films as "Armageddon" and "The
Perfect Storm," has died. He was 62.</LD>
<LD>   Wester died Friday of cancer at his Studio City home, said his
friend Paul Petersen. His final project was the film "Cradle 2 the
Grave," expected to be released next year.</LD>
<LD>   Repeatedly nominated for Emmys for his television sound
engineering, Wester won the statuette in 1986 for "An Early Frost."</LD>
<TE>   He shared Academy Award nominations for sound six times: in 1990
for "Black Rain," 1996 for "Waterworld," 1997 for "The Rock," 1998
for "Air Force One," 1999 for "Armageddon" and last year for "The
Perfect Storm."</TE>
<TE>   Wester was known for his innovation and for mentoring younger
engineers.</TE>
<TE>   "If the sound equipment didn't exist to do the job," Petersen
said, "Keith would invent it."</TE>
<TE>   One of Wester's toughest projects requiring such invention was the
wind and water epic "The Perfect Storm," in which he had to contend
with on-set 100 mph fans and wave machines and, ultimately, record
dialogue between fishing boat captain George Clooney and Mark
Wahlberg as the set was submerged.</TE>
<TE>   "It required that the microphone be able to record decent
dialogue, first of all, and second, not be hurt when it was
submerged, and third, pressed into use again for the next take,"
Wester told The Times after his Oscar nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Working in his Professional Sound Recorders lab in Studio City,
Wester put together a small microphone, electrical PVC tubing,
acoustic foam, hot glue and a condom.</TE>
<TE>   The contraption worked perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   "I mounted it on the ceiling of the wheelhouse and it worked like
a charm," Wester said. "I think I'm going to send that one to the
Smithsonian."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Seattle, Wester was a ham radio operator by age 13 and was
always fascinated by radio and sound equipment.</TE>
<TE>   After receiving his bachelor's degree from Cal State L.A. and a
master's at UCLA, he worked on sound engineering for about 2,500
commercials. By the early 1980s, he was doing production sound work
for major television dramatic programs.</TE>
<TE>   Wester began concentrating on motion pictures in the late 1980s,
handling sound mixing for such films as "Sea of Love," "Joe Versus
the Volcano," "Thelma and Louise," "Frankie and Johnny" and "Body of
Evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Wester is survived by his wife, the former Joan Bursler; a
daughter from his earlier marriage, Wendy Elizabeth Kadovitz; and one
grandson.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is scheduled at 2:30 p.m. Dec. 7 at the Old
North Church, Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills.</TE>

<HD>Wallace to Remain Part of Dodger Plan</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers may lose bench coach Jim Riggleman to the Seattle
Mariners, but they will not lose Dave Wallace, their senior vice
president of baseball operations, to the New York Mets.</LD>
<LD>   While Riggleman was named one of four finalists for the Seattle
managerial job Tuesday, Wallace told the Mets that he turned down a
lucrative offer to become their pitching coach.</LD>
<LD>   "We're real happy about it," Dodger General Manager Dan Evans
said. "I wanted what was best for him, but I was keeping my fingers
crossed that he'd be back."</LD>
<TE>   Wallace was the Mets' pitching coach in 2000, the year they
reached the World Series, and the Mets were believed to have offered
him a salary in the $450,000 range -- which would have made him the
highest-paid pitching coach in baseball -- to return to New York.</TE>
<TE>   Riggleman, meanwhile, will join Arizona bench coach Bob Melvin,
Baltimore bench coach Sam Perlozzo and former Colorado and Detroit
manager Buddy Bell in the group that will return to Seattle for
second interviews next week, Mariner General Manager Pat Gillick
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have told the agent for Dave Hansen they would like to
re-sign the veteran reserve infielder and pinch-hit specialist for
2003, and the sides are expected to reach a one-year deal soon. The
Dodgers will not offer a contract to veteran utility infielder Jeff
Reboulet, who is a free agent, and they are not expected to pick up
the option on reserve catcher Chad Kreuter.</TE>
<TE>   The agent for outfielder Marquis Grissom has been told the Dodgers
would like Grissom back but not at the $5 million he made last
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel third base coach Ron Roenicke,  who interviewed for the
Seattle job Tuesday, and Angel pitching coach Bud Black could surface
as candidates for the San Francisco Giants' job should Dusty Baker
leave.</TE>

<LD>Dusty Baker felt the love of Chicago Cub fans when he was in the
Windy City last weekend for the Notre Dame-Boston College football
game, writes Jay Mariotti of the Chicago Sun-Times:</LD>
<LD>   "[The San Francisco Giant manager] was mobbed by Cub fans, who
view him as the faith healer and mojo man of a 95-year hex....</LD>
<LD>   "On the grandest scale, though, Baker equates love with the amount
of money he is paid. Which is why those fuddy-duddies at Tribune Co.,
if they are truly serious about hiring the franchise's first marquee
manager since Leo Durocher, better be ready to shower him with at
least $12 million of love."</LD>

<TE>   Game-ending drive: Joe Hawk of the Las Vegas Review-Journal
criticized John Jackson, assistant head football coach at Nevada Las
Vegas, for leaving Saturday's game early so he could get to a boxing
card in which he was promoting a fighter:</TE>
<TE>   "A coach can't ask his players to give a full 60 minutes if he
only gives 57 1/2. Leaving early was absolutely, positively wrong --
and Jackson owes his players an apology."</TE>
<TE>   UNLV Coach John Robinson, calling the early departure an error in
judgment, said a letter of reprimand would be put into Jackson's
personnel file.</TE>
<TE>   Not making his day: Skip Bayless of the San Jose Mercury News says
that Oakland Raider Coach Bill Callahan might be too nice to inspire
a reversal of a four-game losing streak, judging by what he observed
at Monday's media briefing:</TE>
<TE>   "You wanted to see some Dirty Harry Callahan. Instead you got
Bill.... An upbeat, media-friendly Callahan acted as if he's calmly
riding a roller coaster that soon will rise again. But these Raiders
need something Callahan might not be able to provide -- some sort of
unifying, refocusing jolt."</TE>
<TE>   Out of sight: Mike Bianchi of the Orlando Sentinel defended
casting a No. 4 vote for unbeaten Bowling Green in the Associated
Press college football poll:</TE>
<TE>   "Go ahead and laugh at me. Go ahead and scream that there's no way
Bowling Green can possibly be one of the top four teams in the
country. Oh, yeah? Well, how would you possibly know how good Bowling
Green is? Have you ever seen Bowling Green play?</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think so."</TE>
<TE>   Dressing down: From Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle:
"Notre Dame and the San Diego Chargers suffered huge upsets after

<LD>PHILADELPHIA -- When the Clippers hit the road last season, the road
hit back.</LD>
<LD>   They had a 14-27 road record, which included two losses to the
Lakers at Staples Center when the Clippers were designated as the
"away" team.</LD>
<LD>   They also lost their first six road games before defeating the
Suns at Phoenix on Dec. 18, 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry isn't expecting much from the injury-riddled
Clippers on a four-game trip that begins tonight against the
Philadelphia 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers also play the New Jersey Nets, Orlando Magic and
Miami Heat.</TE>
<TE>   "We're playing Philly, which was in the NBA Finals two years ago,"
Gentry said. "We're playing New Jersey, which was in the Finals last
year. We're playing Orlando, which thinks its going to be in the
Finals this year.... Ask anybody, except maybe the elite teams, if
they're happy winning half of their road games and, yeah, they'll be
happy. I'll be happy to win any games at this point."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gentry gave veteran coach Don Casey credit for helping the
Clippers win Sunday against the Detroit Pistons. Casey gave a
tutorial on zone defense to the team a little more than a week ago
and it paid off in a 74-72 victory over the Pistons.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers used a zone on 30 Detroit possessions and gave up
only 10 baskets, according to Gentry.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers rallied from a 14-point deficit in the third quarter
to record their first victory of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy knows more about zone defenses than anybody in
basketball," Gentry said of Casey. "He visited with the coaches and
he watched us work on it on the floor and added some things to it. I
don't like zones, but as a coach you do what you can to win. I wish I
had a bag of tricks to reach into."</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Philadelphia, 4 PST</TE>
<TE>   Site -- First Union Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KXTA (1150).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Clippers 1-2, 76ers 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. 76ers (2001-02) -- 0-2.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- Corey Maggette has torn cartilage in his right knee, but
will attempt to play. Quentin Richardson's status is uncertain
because of a hyperextended right knee. The Clippers have lost five
consecutive games to the 76ers. The Clippers also are winless in five
games at the First Union Center. Andre Miller is averaging 15.7
points and 11.3 assists. He was the NBA leader in assists with an
average of 10.9 last season while with the Cleveland Cavaliers. The
76ers haven't played since rallying from a 17-point deficit in the
third quarter Friday to defeat the New York Knicks, 98-86. Allen
Iverson scored 35 points on 12-for-30 shooting to lead Philadelphia.
He is averaging 27 points in 41.3 minutes.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Lost Treasures of NFL Films: Vol. 18, the Press Box"</LD>
<TE>   Where: ESPN Classic, Friday, 4 and 11 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ray Didinger, a former Philadelphia Bulletin sportswriter who
works for NFL Films, had a good idea. After going through some of NFL
Films' "Lost Treasures" footage, he realized how greatly media
coverage of the NFL has changed over the last 30 years. This show,
written and directed by Didinger, is the result.</TE>
<TE>   One problem: The reporters interviewed almost all are from
Philadelphia or New York. They include Dave Anderson of the New York
Times, Bill Lyon of the Philadelphia Inquirer, Bob Drury and Steve
Serby of the New York Post, Peter King of Sports Illustrated and Sal
Paolantonio of ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   It's as though there were no veteran NFL reporters anywhere but on
the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   One from the West Coast is Bob Oates, who has been covering
professional football since 1939. His beats for the old L.A. Examiner
included the minor league Hollywood Bears and L.A. Bulldogs. He has
been covering the NFL since the Rams moved to L.A. in 1946. He was
full time with The Times from 1968-95, still writes a weekly NFL
column for latimes.com, and is as sharp as ever.</TE>
<TE>   But for some reason, NFL Films snubbed Oates, who could have
offered insights no other reporter could.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, it's a pretty good show, highlighted by typical high
quality NFL Films footage and a segment on Elinor Kaine, one of the
first women to cover the NFL. Not only was Kaine banned from locker
rooms, she was banned from press boxes.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the one-hour show is a segment on Pittsburgh
announcer Myron Cope. It's an interesting piece, but doesn't seem to
fit in with the theme of the show.</TE>
<TE>   A better use of the time would have been to include interviews
with reporters from someplace other than New York or Philadelphia.</TE>

<HD>A Fearsome Foursome for Johnson</HD>
<DH>By unanimous vote, Arizona left-hander extends NL Cy Young
streak. Gagne fourth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Winning the Cy Young Award has become so much of an annual event for
Randy Johnson that it failed to interrupt his golf game Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Quiet, please.</LD>
<LD>   In between putting on the second hole at Pebble Beach Golf Links
and teeing off on the third, Johnson used his cellular phone to
answer questions during a conference call with reporters after being
notified he had won the National League award for the fourth
consecutive year in a unanimous vote by a committee of the Baseball
Writers Assn. of America.</LD>
<TE>   "These guys I'm playing with have to be wondering what's going
on," Johnson said of his Pebble Beach partners at one point.</TE>
<TE>   That was before he handed the phone to one of them, who described
his tee shot on No. 3 by saying, "He smashed it right down the
middle."</TE>
<TE>   It isn't known whether Johnson and his partners had some friendly
wagers on the outcome, but the latest Cy Young translated to a
Tiger-type payday of $4 million for the Arizona Diamondbacks'
39-year-old left-hander.</TE>
<TE>   By winning the award in each of his four years with the
Diamondbacks, an accomplishment enhancing the opinion of many in
baseball that Johnson is the best free-agent signing ever, he
receives a $1 million bonus, and his option-year salary in 2003
increases from $12 million to $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about reading the green.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm honored to win the Cy Young again," he said, "but it's not
something I try to do and I don't think Roger [Clemens] does either.
The goal is to reach the World Series each year.</TE>
<TE>   "The award is simply a byproduct of my consistency, hard work and
dedication, and the support I've received from my teammates."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who won the American League award with the Seattle
Mariners in 1995, has won five in all to trail only Clemens, who has
won six. Greg Maddux is the only other pitcher to have won four in a
row, having done it in 1992 through 1995, and there is speculation
that the Atlanta Brave right-hander, a Las Vegas resident, might be
interested in joining Johnson in the Arizona rotation as a free
agent.</TE>
<TE>   "No one has said anything to me about that," Johnson said during
the unique conference call, "but if I was asked, I'd be willing to
invite him out for some golf and see if I can persuade him."</TE>
<TE>   The writers' committee, which voted between the end of the regular
season and start of the playoffs in which Johnson pitched poorly and
the Diamondbacks were eliminated in the first round, didn't have to
be persuaded. Johnson was listed first on all 32 ballots for a
perfect score of 160 points.</TE>
<TE>   Teammate Curt Schilling, who received 29 second-place votes and
three third-place votes, was second with 90 points. Atlanta closer
John Smoltz finished third, with Dodger closer Eric Gagne fourth,
having received two second-place votes and two third-place votes.</TE>
<TE>   The award, for most of the season, appeared to be another horse
race between Johnson and Schilling before Schilling faltered in
September (2-2 record, 6.19 earned-run average), removing some of the
luster from his overall 23-7 record, 3.23 ERA and 316 strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who was 5-0 with an 0.66 ERA in September, became the
first National League pitcher since Dwight Gooden in 1985 and the
first in the majors since Pedro Martinez in 1999 to win pitching's
version of the triple crown by leading the NL with a 24-5 record,
2.32 ERA and 334 strikeouts. He also led the majors with 260 innings,
eight complete games and a .208 opponent's batting average.</TE>
<TE>   Although he turns 40 next September, has experienced back problems
and has raised expectations to a level at which "I'm not given much
room for error," a level at which one poor performance is enough to
create skepticism about his future, Johnson said he still "enjoys the
challenge" of meeting the expectations, still considers himself one
of the game's elite power pitchers and isn't ready to say and doesn't
really know how much longer he'll pitch beyond 2003, the last year of
his Arizona contract.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still learning about pitching, and I suppose that when I stop
learning it will be time to start thinking about retirement," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I jumped from 10th to fourth on the strikeout list [behind only
Nolan Ryan, Steve Carlton and Clemens] this year, so I don't really
think I've lost anything yet."</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition of Maddux or another reliable starter would ease
the pressure and expectations for Johnson and Schilling, who carried
the Diamondbacks to an NL West title. Arizona was 55-15 when the Big
Two started, 43-49 when anyone else started. Maddux, of course, would
also provide Johnson with one more golf partner, someone to hold the
cell phone.</TE>

<DH>DuBose, run out of Alabama after scandal, restarts his
coaching life with high school team</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is the story of a coach's life, and a coach's wife.</LD>
<LD>   It hasn't been long since Mike DuBose was the coach at Alabama,
10-3 and Southeastern Conference champion in 1999 with a team that
played in the Orange Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Now he is the coach at Northview High in Dothan, Ala., after
taking over a winless team when he couldn't find a job coaching in
college or the NFL.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, under the Friday night lights, Northview completed its
first season under DuBose with a 34-0 loss and an 0-10 record.
Winless again.</TE>
<TE>   It sure isn't the way Disney would have written it.</TE>
<TE>   "We've improved, but we haven't improved as much as I thought we
would," DuBose said. "I'm glad I'm back in it, but I haven't enjoyed
losing."</TE>
<TE>   The story would have been better if the coach with the tumultuous
past had returned to the game he loved and transformed a winless
bunch of skinny youngsters into champions. Maybe got those last two
years he needed for his state retirement while he was at it.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the folks in the stands with the Alabama seat cushions or
Auburn ball caps watched and shrugged. They were happy to get DuBose,
but they could have gone winless again without a famous coach.</TE>
<TE>   DuBose was fired at Alabama -- officially urged into resigning --
during a 3-8 season in 2000, a season that started with a No. 3
national ranking but collapsed with losses to Southern Mississippi
and Central Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The year before, he'd survived a sexual-harassment scandal,
despite having admitted that he had initially lied when he'd denied
an improper relationship with a former secretary. The university
settled with the woman for $350,000.</TE>
<TE>   That $350,000 eventually came out of DuBose's paychecks, and that
10-3 season showed that Alabama was honest about what it cares about
in its football coaches: winning.</TE>
<TE>   When Alabama's record crumbled to its worst in 45 years the next
season, no one was standing by DuBose anymore -- with the very
notable exception of his wife, Polly, his sweetheart from their days
at Opp High in Opp, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, Opp, the city of opportunity," she teased. "You haven't
lived unless you've been to Opp.</TE>
<TE>   "God has been so faithful to us, not just in the good times, but
in the hard times.... There are many things I guess you never really
understand. We may never have an answer for them. But I think you
just have to press forward. You just walk on and know God will use
this and make you stronger, and that he has something for you, a hope
and a future for you."</TE>
<TE>   DuBose understands better than anyone else what a remarkable
attitude that is.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a very, very strong lady with tremendous faith. Much
stronger than I am," he said. "She is my strength. I'm very
fortunate. It would have been much more difficult without her. She is
a rock."</TE>
<TE>   There wasn't only the notoriety of the harassment case. Alabama
was put on five years' probation this year for a recruiting scandal
that occurred partly on his watch, though DuBose wasn't charged with
any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   That was only a final blow.</TE>
<TE>   The job at their alma mater was gone. The town where Mike had been
a star defensive lineman on Bear Bryant's 1973 national championship
team no longer felt like home.</TE>
<TE>   The couple's son, Michael, is a senior at Alabama, and their
daughter, Julie, lives in Tuscaloosa with her husband. The DuBoses
don't go back.</TE>
<TE>   "No, we don't. We really don't," Polly said. "The children will
come here and we'll visit. It's just really hard. It's been home for
a long, long time. Mike and I went to school there. Our children grew
up there. It's just real difficult for me to go back."</TE>
<TE>   After Mike's final game as Alabama's coach, he and Polly sold
their house in a day and went to the beach near Destin, Fla., for a
month.</TE>
<TE>   Then they bought a house on a lake in Alabama and went to work
remodeling and gardening.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very healing place for us," Polly said. "Then it got to
be football season and that's when it was like, 'OK, it's time to go
to work.' "</TE>
<TE>   Mike is an excellent cook, but his dishes lost their savor.</TE>
<TE>   "When you start putting the spices in alphabetical order, it's
time to get a job," Polly said.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in their lives together, there was no football
season.</TE>
<TE>   After a year off, Mike, now 49, tried to get back into it, with
little luck.</TE>
<TE>   Four seasons as Alabama's coach, all his years as a Crimson Tide
assistant, even three seasons as a Tampa Bay Buccaneer assistant
didn't crack a door.</TE>
<TE>   All those friends in coaching and not one job offer.</TE>
<TE>   "There are consequences to your actions," Mike said. "I don't want
to say it was because of friendships that the opportunities weren't
there. I don't really know why."</TE>
<TE>   It could have been the taint of NCAA violations, no matter that
DuBose wasn't personally implicated. It could have been the
harassment scandal, the record, even happenstance.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know. I ask myself that, but I don't have an answer,"
DuBose said.</TE>
<TE>   With his retirement not yet secured, DuBose went back to the
bottom.</TE>
<TE>   Northview Principal David Hopson remembers when the phone rang.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a friend who made a call to me and said Coach DuBose is
interested in getting back in coaching and exploring high schools and
asked if I was interested, and certainly I was," Hopson said. "Here's
a guy who's coached in high school, college and the pros. Here was an
opportunity to get someone with that type of background. Everybody
was ecstatic, even those Auburn fans."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't quite unanimous, though.</TE>
<TE>   "There were probably two or three people, at most, who ever let it
be known they thought it was a problem," Hopson said. "I'd say 99.9%
were very much impressed we could get someone of Mike's caliber.
There were a few dissenters. I anticipated there would be, but there
were even less than I thought."</TE>
<TE>   Hopson said he had no worries about DuBose's recent past.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of those, 'Let bygones be bygones' things," Hopson
said. "Let's move forward."</TE>
<TE>   That's what they did.</TE>
<TE>   All the losing, though, had shrunk Northview's roster to a small
group. DuBose's celebrity drew some of the old players back and
brought in some that had never played football at all.</TE>
<TE>   "I know a lot more about the situation now than I did coming in,"
DuBose said. "I made some decisions just to compromise, in letting
guys come out late -- some who didn't go through the off-season
workouts or didn't work as hard as they should.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, I wouldn't do something like that, but I was trying to
get guys involved, participating.</TE>
<TE>   "Some I compromised on ended up quitting on us."</TE>
<TE>   As the losses piled up, the roster shrank again.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we were going to have a good season," said Tommy
Gilbert, the team's talented freshman quarterback. "We're coming
along, but we've got some players who don't want it as bad as the
coach."</TE>
<TE>   Northview isn't without football history. The school of 1,155
students won state championships, in 1981 and '85, and two players
from that era went on to the NFL. Defensive end Larry Roberts played
at Alabama and went on to play for the San Francisco 49ers, and
receiver Lawrence Dawsey played for Florida State and Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   This season, the best player on the team was probably Brian
Jackson, a kicker with 50-yard range.</TE>
<TE>   "We're small, young and inexperienced," DuBose said.</TE>
<TE>   In 10 games, Northview was shut out four times and outscored,
272-53.</TE>
<TE>   The closest game was the next-to-last game of the season against
rival Dothan, a 15-12 loss in which Jackson missed a potential tying
field goal shorter than one he had made earlier in the game.</TE>
<TE>   The final game -- against 9-1 Mary Montgomery of Mobile -- DuBose
stood his ground and suspended one of his best players for
disciplinary reasons. Not that it made much difference.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that we've lost to a football team we should have
beaten," DuBose said. "I don't think I can say we were better than
anyone we played. That's not the same as saying we didn't have
chances to win, but I don't think there were any we should have won.
Again, losing is hard. The thing you have to do is learn from it."</TE>
<TE>   Far from his days on chartered flights and private planes, DuBose
rode the bus to road games two hours away this season, coaching in
stadiums where cheerleaders spell out "HOMECOMING" by poking
Styrofoam cups into the openings in chain-link fences.</TE>
<TE>   "There are times I'm disappointed and frustrated," he said. "Life
is a process, like everything else.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure to be competitive is still there. It's not the same
from a national standpoint, but most pressure is self-inflicted
anyway. I've always thought pressure was good for you. But if
pressure becomes stress, it can become deadly."</TE>
<TE>   DuBose absorbed the losing this season fairly well, but exactly
when Northview's 21-game losing streak will end remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike's making the turn," said Hopson, the principal. "He hasn't
turned the corner yet, but we are rebuilding."</TE>
<TE>   DuBose is far from ready to quit coaching. Still, another
opportunity could tempt him.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to keep our eyes and ears open," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Before the season ended, he and Polly discovered they could secure
Mike's state retirement with just this one year.</TE>
<TE>   "We will have three years we can buy from out of state that would
make the 25 years," Polly said. "We thought we needed two more years
in Alabama, but actually at the end of the year, we could leave the
state.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll sit down and talk about it, pray about it and see what the
options are.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt, Mike really misses college football, and I
really do too."</TE>

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Havelid's Defense Is Offensive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defenseman Niclas Havelid is a big fan of the NHL's crackdown on
obstruction. While he feels it is good for the game, there is some
selfishness involved.</LD>
<LD>   Havelid, healthy for the first time in nearly two seasons, has
been the Ducks' most effective offensive defenseman this season,
benefiting from the rule enforcement. His strengths as a defenseman
lean more toward skating and puck handling than bumping and grinding.</LD>
<LD>   "You have to be able to move quicker and use good body position,"
Havelid said.</LD>
<TE>   Havelid has taken advantage of that. He leads Duck defensemen with
five assists, three more than he had in 52 games last season.
Although he has yet to score a goal, he hit the post twice with shots
on power play.</TE>
<TE>   As important is his ability to bring the puck out up the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the game is now, you can't hold anyone up," Coach Mike
Babcock said. "You have to be able to move the puck fast. When you
look at teams, they have transition defensemen and they really come
at you with speed."</TE>
<TE>   That is what the Ducks expected of Havelid when he made the jump
from Sweden to the NHL in the 1999-2000 season. Since then, he has
been slowed by injuries, including a severe knee injury in 2000-01
that took more than a year to rehabilitate completely.</TE>
<TE>   "Last season, my leg was strong, but it wasn't where I wanted it
to be," Havelid said. "I couldn't do any off-ice work. You lose
confidence when you feel you're not 100%."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right wing Alexei Smirnov returned to practice Tuesday and is
expected to play tonight against Nashville. Smirnov left Monday's
practice with a wrist injury, but X-rays were negative.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Samuel Pahlsson has been suspended indefinitely by the
Ducks for leaving Cincinnati, their minor league team, and returning
to Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Pahlsson, 24, played 80 games for the Ducks last season, but did
not make the team out of training camp this season. Duck officials
said they have not had contact with Pahlsson since he left
Cincinnati.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Wisconsin running back Anthony Davis, treated over the weekend for a
stab wound allegedly inflicted by his girlfriend, was charged Tuesday
with a misdemeanor count of battery.</LD>
<LD>   Police alleged that Davis punched his girlfriend in the face
during an argument at his apartment early Sunday before he was
stabbed in the leg.</LD>
<LD>   Davis, 20, a sophomore, faces a maximum penalty of nine months in
jail and a $10,000 fine.</LD>
<TE>   Tiffany L. Spears, 22, was charged with second-degree recklessly
endangering safety and aggravated battery, both felonies. The maximum
penalty on those charges is 15 years in prison and $20,000 in fines.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was not the only Badger to encounter troubles last weekend.
Injured receiver Lee Evans was charged with a tentative misdemeanor
marijuana possession charge.</TE>

<TE>   Virginia Tech tailback Kevin Jones will be out for two to four
weeks because of a strained left hamstring. Rover Michael Crawford
underwent tests for lymphoma but is expected to play Saturday against
Syracuse.... Utah running back Marty Johnson could face
drunken-driving charges in a case in which he is accused of leaving
the scene of an Oct. 27 accident after crashing into a parked car
near Rice-Eccles Stadium. Former teammate Anthony Arceneaux, kicked
off the team for an undisclosed violation of team rules a week
earlier, also was arrested for allegedly trying to cover for
Johnson.... Iowa running back Fred Russell (hand injury) is expected
to play Saturday against Northwestern. Russell's backup, Jermelle
Lewis, was charged with fourth-degree criminal mischief and
disorderly conduct for his role in a fight last weekend and is
expected to be disciplined.... Northwestern announced that, because
of an error in statistics, running back Jason Wright actually had 196
yards rushing against Indiana, not 219. He had been given credit for
a 23-yard rush that was really a 23-yard pass from quarterback Brett
Basanez to receiver Ashton Aikens.... Louisville defensive lineman
Brandon Cornell has been suspended from the team after an arrest on
charges of firing a BB pistol at two people from his dorm room....
Sacramento State Coach John Volek was suspended by the Big Sky

<LD>When Tim Smith, the commissioner of the National Thoroughbred Racing
Assn., brunched with industry leaders last week at a Beverly Hills
hotel, Rick Baedeker, president of Hollywood Park, posed a timely
question.</LD>
<LD>   "What can we do about the final odds not showing on the tote board
until the horses turn for home?" Baedeker asked.</LD>
<LD>   Smith didn't have a ready answer and, for now at least, neither
does anyone else in the sport.</LD>
<TE>   "This is all linked to the consumer-confidence issue," Smith said.
"It's a problem we have as an industry. We've got to take a deep,
thorough look at all aspects of wagering technology."</TE>
<TE>   Today is another opening day at Hollywood Park -- the track's
35-day fall meet runs through Dec. 22 -- and Baedeker no doubt is
thinking about what happened when his track's spring-summer season
opened in April. A maiden filly left the gate in the first race at
9-2 odds, but by the time she reached the wire, 3 1/2 lengths in
front, her price had plunged to 2-5. Even winning bettors were
puzzled and angry. A $2 win ticket, instead of being worth $11, paid
only $2.80.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, it was only a blip on the public-confidence screen,
explained away by last-second bets totaling $118,000 that went
through a hub in Lewiston, Maine. Those bets, made in denominations
of $3,000 and $5,000, represented 91% of the total win pool on the
winning horse and brought a quick profit of $47,200.</TE>
<TE>   Now, when viewed through the prism of the questionable winning
pick-six tickets at last month's Breeders' Cup -- bets worth more
than $3 million that might never be paid because they are suspected
of having been placed four races into the pick six -- Hollywood
Park's opening-day first race is perceived by jaundiced horseplayers
as a precursor of bigger scams.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a pretty landscape out there for track managers like
Baedeker.</TE>
<TE>   The Daily Racing Form, which usually runs a full page of readers'
letters about a variety of topics on Sunday, published nothing but
responses to the Breeders' Cup pick-six fiasco last Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Absent the integrity of the betting pool, there is no point in
ever making a bet on horses again," was a comment from Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Another cynical opinion came from Kentucky, heartland of the
thoroughbred breeding industry in the U.S.:</TE>
<TE>   "Until the obvious design flaw in the system is rectified, betting
the pick six requires belief that every person involved in
administering and operating the system is honest. That is a leap of
faith I am not prepared to make."</TE>
<TE>   Another letter, from Florida, referred to tracks like Hollywood
Park pinning dramatic during-the-race odds shifts on simulcast
betting:</TE>
<TE>   "If they have no other solution, then they have to stop accepting
bets at least three minutes before the start of a race. Bettors may
not like that, but we prefer it to cheating and being robbed by
computer-savvy thieves."</TE>
<TE>   The investigation into the Breeders' Cup pick six broadened Monday
when Donald Groth, president of the Catskill Off-Track Betting Corp.
in New York, told the Thoroughbred Times that he had turned over to
authorities the name of a third person who may be questioned. That
person, a Catskill betting account holder who was not identified by
Groth, is believed to be an acquaintance of Derrick Davis and Chris
Harn, who have been linked to the possible scam.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who bet $1,152 on the pick six through a new Catskill
account, held the only winning tickets on the pick six, and Harn, a
fraternity brother of Davis' in college, was fired Thursday by the
Autotote Corp., whose officials said that he had access to the system
and could have altered tickets after the first four races were run.</TE>
<TE>   Payoffs have been held up on the pick six. Attorneys for Davis and
Harn have said that their clients will be cleared of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Licht, vice chairman of the California Horse Racing Board,
said that the fallout from the pick six is more detrimental to the
game than a race-fixing scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing that might happen is that all the needed attention
that's being focused on the operations of the tote companies might
detract from the energy usually expended on sniffing out improper
backstretch activities," Licht said.</TE>
<TE>   With more scrutiny than ever, track executives are monitoring the
sizes of their pick-six betting pools. At California tracks this
year, more than $100 million has been bet on the pick six. The tracks
heavily promote a pick six when a day or days go by without anyone
picking the winners of all six races, resulting in a carry-over pool
with the potential for a huge payoff. The Hollywood Park payoff
record for a pick six, set in 1998, is $928,127.40. The national
record, set at Bay Meadows in 1985, is $1,132,466.</TE>
<TE>   During the last five days of the Oak Tree meet that ended Sunday
at Santa Anita, betting on the pick six did not appear to have
suffered. Comparable-day studies of the pick six are sometimes
difficult because of the carry-over factor. Last Saturday, for
example, Oak Tree offered a guaranteed $1-million pick six on
California Cup day. The track did not have to supplement the pool,
because the handle totaled $1.3 million, with the benefit of a
two-day carry-over of almost $360,000. On Cal Cup day the year
before, the pool for another guaranteed $1-million pick six totaled
$1.2 million, with a one-day carry-over of $82,000.</TE>
<TE>   What did drop on Cal Cup day was track attendance, which with an
attractive card had been expected to surpass the crowd of the year
before. Instead, the gate count was 27,901, a decline of more than
30% from 2001.</TE>

<HD>Gardena's Revival Is One for the Ages</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last time Gardena won the City Section championship, Watergate
and gas shortages dominated the news, the Vietnam War was coming to
an end and "The Exorcist" played to huge crowds.</LD>
<LD>   The year was 1973. That November, Gardena capped its 11-0-1 season
by defeating Marine League rival Carson, 28-0, to win the City
championship. Then nicknamed the Mohicans -- now the Panthers -- it
would be their last City championship.</LD>
<LD>   The last time Gardena won a league title was the next year, but it
lost in the playoffs. So, it's no surprise that Friday's game against
Carson (6-2, 3-0 in league) is being treated with a sense of urgency.
The winner is guaranteed a share of the Marine League title.</LD>
<TE>   It's the biggest game for Gardena (6-2, 3-0) since it reached the
City Invitational final three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, for our program this game means a lot," Coach Marshall
Jones said. "It's been too long since we've been in this position."</TE>
<TE>   Gardena put itself in title contention with a dramatic 25-21
victory over Wilmington Banning last week. The Panthers rallied from
a 21-6 third-quarter deficit, and senior quarterback LaFerrell Payne
scored the game-winner on a 22-yard option keeper with 26 seconds
left.</TE>
<TE>   That victory and another, 29-20 over San Pedro one week earlier,
came after the Panthers were upset by Jefferson. Jones said that
defeat helped to refocus his team.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the last couple of weeks we have shown a lot of maturity
and poise," said Jones, in his fifth year at Gardena. "We've had some
comebacks, but I can't remember one like that against such a quality
team [Banning]."</TE>
<TE>   Payne is the key to an option offense that features running backs
DeAndre Hughes and Jason Franklin.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more important is the increase in size of the Panthers'
offensive linemen. Seniors Josh Marby, Pa'a Sapolu and Jose Sanchez,
and juniors Delvin Dennis and Dionecio Ibarra average 270 pounds and,
along with senior tight end Fred Earles, are a major upgrade over
front lines of the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   "There are big kids on this campus right now that are not playing
football," Jones said. "But when you start winning, you attract more
interest from kids. We've gotten a few of them out here the last
couple of years."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Paul Cole, who has been with Gardena off and on since he
graduated from the school in 1969, said the re-emergence of the local
youth football program and a coaching staff full of former players
has helped revitalize the program.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not where we want to it be [yet]," Cole said, "but we're
getting there."</TE>
<TE>   Jones, a 1979 Gardena graduate who spent seven years as coach at
L.A. University, said he always wanted to coach at his alma mater.</TE>
<TE>   "The last five years have been real fun," he said. "I was an
assistant here and when I left, I left with a heavy heart. I thought
it was important to make Gardena the proud program it had been."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coaching at one of the smallest schools in the section, Eagle
Rock's Steve Wahl rarely has access to top talent, but he doesn't
complain and it doesn't keep him from fielding competitive teams
every season.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the Eagles (6-2, 2-1) are in a position to play for the
Northern League championship. They are one game behind Franklin (7-1,
3-0) with a possible league title showdown with the Panthers next
week.</TE>
<TE>   The last time Eagle Rock was in a similar position was in 1999,
with All-City quarterback Torwin Session and fullback Rhuben
Williams, but the Eagles lost to Franklin.</TE>
<TE>   Wahl is 53-35 in eight seasons at Eagle Rock, which is a combined
middle school and high school with an enrollment of 2,800. It is the
only school in the district with that grade configuration, other than
magnet and specialized schools.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a community school," Wahl said. "We don't recruit, we have
no permits, we've got no kids bussed in. We do it the old-fashioned
way, which, I guess, is the way high school football was meant to be
played."</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles don't have stars like Session or Williams on their
roster this season, but they do field an experienced squad with 14
returning starters.</TE>
<TE>   Running back John Paul Yniguez has 15 touchdowns and 914 yards,
including 164 against Belmont and 135 against Tujunga Verdugo Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The return of receiver-defensive back Luis Estrada, receiver Mario
Munoz and lineman Juan Morales from early-season injuries has also
helped.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin has been the league's standard-bearer with eight titles
in the last nine years, and Wahl admits there is temptation to look
ahead, but ...</TE>
<TE>   "We're not that good to do that," he said. "Whenever you play
Franklin for first place or third place, it's always a big game.
We're kind of sensing that it can be a huge game for us, but we're
certainly not looking ahead."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Venice's Eddie Miller has put up some big numbers in his two years
as a starting quarterback, but the senior may never perform better
than he did last week against La Verne Damien.</TE>
<TE>   Miller threw for 479 yards and three touchdowns in a 42-37 loss to
Damien, then ranked No. 23 by The Times. Receivers Antwuan Giddens
and B.J. Vickers had a combined 24 receptions for 387 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Damien Coach Mark Pasquarella came away impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very good and very accurate," Pasquarella said of Miller.
"Those two receivers are going to be playing on Saturdays. If [the
Gondoliers] find a way to stop the run, they're going to be dangerous
in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Miller has been among the Southland's passing leaders all season,
throwing for 2,633 yards and 22 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   City top 10: 1. Taft (8-0); 2. Birmingham (6-2); 3. Carson (6-2);
4. Venice (6-2); 5. Crenshaw (5-3); 6. Gardena (6-2); 7. Fremont
(7-1); 8. Roosevelt (7-1); 9. Franklin (7-1); 10. Sylmar (6-2).</TE>

<LD>   The decision of the 10-member panel will be announced today, City
Section Commissioner Barbara Fiege said. Pruitt, a junior guard,
starred for Compton Centennial last season and Reese, a sophomore
forward, played for Carson. Both players' transfers to Westchester,
the reigning state Division I champion, are being contested by their
former schools.</LD>
<LD>   Carson officials say Reese's father was coached by Westchester
Athletic Director Brian Henderson on how to request a specific
transfer from Carson. They also say Westchester assistant Marlon
Morton recruited Reese, who was among the top freshmen in the City
Section last season.</LD>
<TE>   After Reese was denied a transfer on three occasions, his father,
Ray Sr., filed a change of residence for his son. That new address is
being challenged by Carson officials, who contend Reese does not live
there.</TE>
<TE>   Before meeting with the panel on Tuesday, Morton, Henderson and Ed
Azzam, Westchester's head coach, all denied wrongdoing. The meeting
was closed to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   As for Pruitt, who helped lead Centennial to the state Division
III championship game last season, the rules committee investigated
whether he had already used his only allowable transfer. Pruitt
initially lived in the Manual Arts district and may have used his one
inter-district transfer to go to Centennial, in the Compton school
district.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's meeting centered on the eligibility of the players. If
penalties are to be levied against Westchester, they would be
determined at another meeting, Fiege said.</TE>
<TE>   The City Section basketball season starts Monday.</TE>

<TE>   Fillmore posted its highest finish in the Ventura County
cross-country championships with its runner-up finish behind Simi
Valley Royal last Saturday. But Flashes Coach Epi Torres said Oak
Park is the team to beat in Tri-Valley League finals today at Lake
Casitas.</TE>
<TE>   "They've won the last four or five league titles," Torres said.
"And they beat us in the Southern Section and state championships
last year.... They're the team to beat."</TE>
<TE>   Oak Park, the two-time defending Southern Section Division IV
champion and runner-up to McFarland in the last two state meets,
placed sixth in the Ventura County championships. But the Eagles'
coaching staff kept some of their top runners out of the meet in an
effort to keep them fresh in the final month of the season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Some coaches don't want to race their kids too much at this time
of the season," Torres said. "They're afraid they'll get injured. But
we just look at races as part of our training. We use them to help
get us ready for the big meets at the end of the season."</TE>

<LD>Hollywood Park isn't the only track beginning another meet this
afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   About 15 minutes after $32,000 maiden fillies and mares are sent
on their way in the opener of a 35-day season in Inglewood, Golden
Gate Fields begins its marathon run of 105 days.</LD>
<LD>   There are no stakes races on the eight-race program in Albany, but
Hollywood Park has the $70,000 Bien Bien Stakes for 3-year-olds at
one mile on the turf. It's a prep for the $500,000 Hollywood Derby on
Dec. 1.</LD>
<TE>   After Paxtecum and Sweet Stepper were scratched Tuesday, a field
of 10 was left for the Bien Bien, which was won a year ago by the now
retired Mizzen Mast.</TE>
<TE>   Only two of the contenders are coming off victories and the
hottest of that pair is Asong For Billy.</TE>
<TE>   Since being claimed for $40,000 on July 4 by trainer Paul Aguirre
for Wong's Stable Inc., the Unbridled's Song gelding has won three in
a row, among them a 5 1/2-length romp at Del Mar in his only previous
start on the turf. He will be ridden by Iggy Puglisi, who has been
aboard for all three victories.</TE>
<TE>   Vronsky, a Danzig colt trained by Kristin Mulhall for owner Steve
Taub, broke his maiden in his turf debut on Oct. 2 at Santa Anita.
The second-and-third place finishers in that race both won their next
starts.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fifth at Hollywood Park is a 1 1/4-mile
affair on the turf and begins the meet's first pick four, the bet of
choice for many fans.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Bobby Frankel. He led the standings here with 23 wins
during the spring-summer meet and will send out three horses today --
Mont Saint Michel and Indigo Myth in the fifth and True Phenomenon in
the Bien Bien.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Patrick Valenzuela. The leading rider here during the
spring-summer meet, Valenzuela has decided to serve three five-day
suspensions he had previously appealed and he will be absent through
Nov. 24.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Indigo Myth, Mont Saint
Michel and Tricky Travis in the fifth, singling Correct Meow in the
sixth, Asong For Billy, Golden Arrow and Vronsky in the seventh and
J.T.'s Song, Calcupbound and Dinnerathepalms in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: (Final for Oak Tree): Previous day/meet total: 2/74.
Money: Previous day/meet total: $17.20/$439. Total money bet: $460.</TE>

<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Since the Kings don't play the second game of their eight-game,
17-day trip until Friday at Ottawa, Coach Andy Murray kept his team
overnight in San Jose after their game against the Sharks on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Murray's reasoning? The more rest his players can get, the better.
After playing the Senators, the Kings play at Montreal Saturday and
Toronto Nov. 12. Then the Kings will fly back to the West Coast to
play at Vancouver Nov. 14 and Edmonton Nov. 16.</LD>
<LD>   From there, the Kings leave Canada to play at Minnesota Nov. 19
and St. Louis Nov. 21.</LD>
<TE>   "I think this is the most interesting trip in the history of the
NHL," Murray said, sarcastically. "We'll get to see a lot of
different geography and different cultures. We'll go from
French-speaking Canada to Western Canada and back to the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   "You really don't know what clothing to bring, so our suitcases
are pretty full.... All I know is that if we earned frequent-flier
miles, I'd have a free trip to Hawaii when we got done."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Aaron Miller, who participated in the Kings' morning
skates the previous two game days,, is expected to be in the lineup
at Ottawa after sitting out the first 13 games of the season because
of abdominal surgery.</TE>

<HD>A Trip Back in Time</HD>
<DH>Allowing three goals in third period, Kings drop a 5-2
decision for the second night in a row, this time to San Jose.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>It was midway into the third period and the Kings trailed San Jose by
a goal, but they had the Sharks scrambling on defense, thanks to a
rush led by winger Mikko Eloranta.</LD>
<LD>   Then just when it looked as if the Kings were about to tie the
score, they failed to get off a solid shot and in the process, San
Jose's net was knocked nearly a foot away from the end line. But the
officials never stopped play and neither did the Sharks, who came
down the ice and scored again.</LD>
<LD>   It was that type of night for the Kings, who opened their longest
trip of the season with a 5-2 loss Tuesday night in front of 17,496
at HP Pavilion.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not playing as a team right now," defenseman Mathieu
Schneider said about the Kings, who held a team meeting after the
game. "Things that we were doing over the first six or seven games
and even in training camp, supporting each other and making the
simple plays, we're not doing right now.</TE>
<TE>   "That was an easy game for [the Sharks]. They were able to come
out of our end easily and cycled without any trouble, get traffic to
the net.... All the things that we want to be doing, they took us to
school with tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Lynn Loyns scored the first two goals of his NHL career and
goaltender Evgeni Nabokov stopped 27 shots for the Sharks as they
handed the Kings their second defeat in two days.</TE>
<TE>   It was a rough night all around for the Kings, who finished the
game two players short because of injuries. Enforcer Ken Belanger
suffered a mild concussion in the first period and Eloranta left the
game in the third with a leg injury.</TE>
<TE>   "We came in here to play the second of back-to-back games ... and
our goalie [Felix Potvin] gave us a chance for the first 40 minutes,"
said King Coach Andy Murray, whose team lost, 5-2, to Minnesota on
Monday. "Even though they got goals in the last 20, I thought the ice
was tilted there [in the Kings' favor] for a while.... They're a good
team but we have to be better than we were tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the previous two games, the Kings jumped out to an early
lead against the Sharks.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Smolinski, who's being counted on to step up at center for
the injured Jason Allison, completed a nifty play down the center of
the ice to set up the score. With two defenders on him, Smolinski
made a touch pass to defenseman Jaroslav Modry, who jumped into the
play and scored from near the right circle, giving the Kings a 1-0
lead at 3:29 of the first period.</TE>
<TE>   But the Kings could not hold the momentum from Modry's fifth goal
in his last four games and the Sharks turned to Loyns to get back
into the game. Thanks to some sloppy play by the Kings in their own
zone, Loyns crashed the net and knocked the puck past Potvin to even
the score at 1-1 midway into the period.</TE>
<TE>   Loyns' goal gave the Sharks some added spark and they continued to
apply pressure on the King defense until they added another goal
before the first intermission.</TE>
<TE>   Loyns was again the man in the right place at the right time.
After Potvin had trouble controlling the puck following a glove save
on San Jose's Matt Bradley, Loyns was able to backhand a shot into
the net while laying face down on the ice at 14:27.</TE>
<TE>   Things began to fall apart for the Kings in the third period. Mike
Rathje scored twice sandwiched around a goal by Todd Harvey as the
Sharks scored three times in the final five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to find a way to elevate our game," Schneider said. "We
can't use the schedule as an excuse.... We have to regroup."</TE>

<HD>Bryant Hasn't Picked a Winner in Footrace</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CLEVELAND -- Double the points, double the rebounds, double the
assists, double the ... shoes.</LD>
<LD>   Between his triple doubles against the Clippers and Portland, Kobe
Bryant, without a shoe contract since splitting with Adidas in the
summer, switched from Nike to Reebok.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant won't talk much about negotiations -- Nike and Reebok are
said to be frothing the most, though industry insiders say they'd be
shocked if Bryant weren't ultimately in his very own Nikes -- having
said he would not rush the process.</LD>
<TE>   Persistent rumors, flatly denied by Bryant and his
representatives, contend that parting terms with Adidas do not allow
Bryant to sign with a new shoe company until later this season,
perhaps until the All-Star break, and that he cannot wear the same
brand of shoe for more than three consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   When Bryant and Adidas ended a six-year relationship that paid him
about $5 million a year in mid-July, Adidas said that Bryant would
"play in various brands next season while evaluating his options,"
presumptuous if Bryant's contract had simply expired.</TE>
<TE>   Still, said a person closer to Bryant than the shoe companies,
"He's a free agent. He can sign with anyone tomorrow, if he wanted."</TE>
<TE>   In exhibition games, Bryant wore Nike shoes six times and Reeboks
twice.</TE>
<TE>   In his first four regular-season games, he stayed with the
rotation, wearing Nike three times and Reebok once.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bryant said he would play in the 2004 Olympics if selected, and
that he'd like Shaquille O'Neal to join him.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in his ear a little bit," Bryant said. "He said, 'If
you do it, I'll do it.' "</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal had previously said that he would play if Laker Coach Phil
Jackson were the coach.</TE>
<TE>   A possible hurdle is next summer's Olympic qualifier, which no one
seems to have much interest in. Bryant, for one, is expecting a
daughter in February, his first child.</TE>
<TE>   "Two straight summers might be a bit much," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As it was, after feeling some urge to play at the World
Championships in September, Bryant sat out to be beside wife Vanessa
through the early part of the pregnancy. "I didn't want to miss
anything," he said.</TE>

<HD>Subpar Lakers Shoot a 70</HD>
<DH>They set L.A. franchise low in 89-70 loss to Cavaliers.
Bryant gets 15 points and no help from teammates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>The Lakers left through a cold drizzle, having scored 70 points,
having missed 60 shots, having been routed by one of the poor teams
in a diluted league.</LD>
<LD>   Shaquille O'Neal sat on the end of the bench. Rick Fox would be in
Boston by this morning. And that had left Kobe Bryant, his string of
triple-doubles, and handfuls of teammates who wouldn't shoot
straight.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers were 89-70 losers to the Cleveland Cavaliers Tuesday
night at Gund Arena, scoring an L.A. franchise low, by four points.</LD>
<TE>   "Disgust," Samaki Walker said on his way into the night. "There
was no reason for us to go out and lose a game like that."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant had 15 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists, that assist
short of his third consecutive triple-double, though it wasn't as if
he didn't try. Devean George missed 12 of 18 shots, Robert Horry
missed six of seven, Tracy Murray missed five of six, and on and on.</TE>
<TE>   They combined to make 31.8% of their shots, while the Cavaliers
had Ricky Davis, who scored 24 points, and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, who
scored 23 against the Laker centers, such as they are.</TE>
<TE>   The momentum of two consecutive victories, of Bryant's reliance
upon them, of the chance to reach the end of O'Neal's rehabilitation
without going to pieces, was gone in a 10-point fourth quarter and a
hail of long, wayward jumpers.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant took one shot in the fourth quarter and four in the second
half. Bidding to become the first Laker with three consecutive
triple-doubles in 15 years, the first NBA player with as many in
five, he continuously found teammates in perfect stride, in shooters'
rhythms, only to find himself chasing rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Coach Phil Jackson told Bryant he should have scored
more and Bryant didn't disagree. Bryant had 13 attempts -- five fewer
than George, one more than Walker, two more than Slava Medvedenko.</TE>
<TE>   But, Bryant would not turn away from them. He would not take on
the Cavaliers, one on three, even if Davis had compared defending
Bryant to a "walk in the park" in the morning newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "I told you guys, that stuff doesn't get my juices flowing
anymore," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So he passed and he rebounded and, when he had to, when the shot
clock flashed 5 and he had the basketball and everybody stared, he
shot.</TE>
<TE>   "It means a lot, because it shows them how much trust I have in
them," Bryant said. "I kept going to them. I kept feeding them. I
kept telling them, 'I know you guys are going to hit shots, and I'm
going to keep coming to you.' And I think that puts a little bit of
pressure on them, to know that we're in this together. I think it's a
huge responsibility for them."</TE>
<TE>   After shooting 31.8% in the season opener against San Antonio, the
Lakers had started to find their touch. Then, against a defense that
forced Bryant to carry the ball up the floor, then forced them all
into perimeter shots, they trailed for the final 26 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   LeBron James, the prep star from nearby Akron who almost surely
will be the first overall draft pick in June, sat a few rows behind
the Laker bench and mostly held his cell phone to his ear. He's
supposed to be the next Kobe. The current one is 24 years old, and
he's still finding a balance between doing his thing and having
others do theirs, particularly when O'Neal is in a white pullover,
not a purple and gold one.</TE>
<TE>   Some nights it goes. Others, they score 70 points and he finds
himself on the bench for the last couple of minutes, a towel over his
legs, a hard frown on his face, life running through his head.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to describe his thoughts, sitting there, O'Neal staring at
him sympathetically, Bryant shook his head.</TE>

<TE>   They trudged through a tunnel and into their bus, its exhaust
white and damp. They'll play Boston on Thursday night, Washington on
Friday, and they'd just given away the easy one. O'Neal is eligible

Tuesday night he wouldn't. The Lakers are 2-3 without him.</TE>

<HD>McGrady's 41 Lead Magic Over the Kings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After five games, Tracy McGrady already has a strong feeling about
where he and Grant Hill can lead the Orlando Magic.</LD>
<LD>   McGrady broke the 40-point barrier for the second straight game,
scoring 41 Tuesday night as the Magic held off a Sacramento rally and
beat the injury-riddled Kings, 125-121, at Orlando, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   "I see something good with this team in the playoffs. I really
think this is the team of the East," McGrady said. "Last year, I was
hoping that we were going to be a good team. This year, I truly
believe we're a good team. Having Grant back is really helping our
confidence even more."</LD>
<TE>   McGrady, coming off a 47-point performance in a win at Milwaukee,
made 15 of 27 shots and also had eight rebounds and seven assists for
the Magic, which is off to a 4-1 start for the first time since
1998-99.</TE>
<TE>   Hill, who sat out the second half of Saturday's victory over the
Bucks after feeling pain in his surgically repaired left ankle, had
21 points in 33 minutes while showing no signs of being hampered by
the injury that sidelined him most of the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Jackson scored 16 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter,
keying a rally from a 109-91 deficit in the last 8:25, but an
offensive foul in the final minute kept the Kings from overtaking the
Magic.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 90, Washington 86 -- Kendall Gill rallied the
Timberwolves with nine of his 22 points in the fourth quarter for the
victory at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Garnett was five for five in the final quarter and finished
with 17 points and 16 rebounds for Minnesota, which outscored the
Wizards, 24-11, in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The game drew an announced crowd of 18,009 -- 997 short of
capacity. It was only the fourth time since Michael Jordan's return
-- the first this season -- that a Wizard game hasn't sold out.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 83, Miami 79 -- Brad Miller scored 28 points and made key
plays on both ends of the floor in the final minute to help the
Pacers win at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied, 77-77, Miller lobbed a perfect pass above the
rim for Jermaine O'Neal, whose dunk put the Pacers ahead with 50
seconds left. Miller then blocked a shot by Eddie Jones, whose strong
play had helped Miami rally in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 93, Golden State 73 -- Malik Rose made only the
seventh three-pointer of his career, a 39-footer to end a lopsided
third quarter, as the Spurs cruised at San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   After trailing, 45-42, at halftime, the Spurs outscored the
Warriors, 31-12, in the third quarter. Rose's three-pointer beat the
buzzer and gave San Antonio a 73-57 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 104, Houston 97 -- Gary Payton had a career-high 18
assists as the SuperSonics almost blew a 20-point fourth-quarter lead
before holding off the Rockets at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle (4-0) pulled away in the third quarter with long-range
shooting, making five three-pointers. The SuperSonics finished 11 for
18 from three-point range, including four of five by Vladimir
Radmanovic.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 103, Denver 87 -- Glenn Robinson was held below 30 points
for the first time this season, but the visiting Hawks still won
their third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, who scored 34, 30 and 30 in Atlanta's first three games,
had 23 points. Shareef Abdur-Rahim had 19 points and 12 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio Spur guard Speedy Claxton is expected to sit out eight
to 12 weeks because of a dislocated right shoulder.</TE>

<HD>Da Matta Signs Formula One Deal</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toyota made official Tuesday the long anticipated signing of
Cristiano da Matta to a Formula One contract.</LD>
<LD>   The Brazilian driver, who has already clinched the Championship
Auto Racing Teams championship driving a Toyota-powered Lola for Carl
Haas and Paul Newman, will join France's Olivier Panis on the
Panasonic Toyota Racing team for 2003 and 2004.</LD>
<LD>   "I have accomplished one of my goals by winning the CART title,"
said da Matta, 29, who has raced in North America for the last six
years. "Now I am ready for the next challenge. It is great to be able
to ... further develop my already successful partnership with
Toyota."</LD>
<TE>   In a related move, Bruno Junqueira, da Matta's countryman and
boyhood friend, has been signed by Newman/Haas Racing to replace him
in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   -- Shav Glick</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Spencer's disappointing run at Chip Ganassi Racing ended
when the car owner fired him after one season.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer will run the last two races in the No. 41 Dodge, then be
released from the three-year contract he signed before this season.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   Jose Canseco and his twin brother pleaded guilty to charges they
beat up two men in a Miami nightclub fight, agreeing to probation and
community service but avoiding prison time.</TE>
<TE>   The Cansecos made the deal while their trial was in jury
selection.</TE>
<TE>   Canseco, 26th on the career home run list, and his brother, former
big leaguer Ozzie, also will have to attend anger management classes.</TE>
<TE>   A court hearing over whether Ted Williams' daughter can challenge
her half brother's desire to have the Hall of Famer's body
cryogenically preserved was postponed for a second time.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing had been scheduled for today in Citrus County (Fla.)
Circuit Court. No new date had been set.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   A female freshman soccer player at Bowling Green died at the
hospital after collapsing five minutes into a game, a nursing
supervisor said.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Dawley was away from the ball when she fell during a
Mid-American Conference tournament game against Buffalo at Bowling
Green, Ohio. Trainers rushed onto the field and tried to revive the
18-year-old player.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said she did not know what caused Dawley's death. She said
an autopsy would be done in the next few days.</TE>
<TE>   Duke junior Alana Beard was the only player on all 44 ballots for
the Associated Press preseason All-America team in women's
basketball.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the 5-foot-11 Beard, the national media panel
selected Connecticut's Diana Taurasi (41 votes), a former high school
All-American from Chino Don Lugo High who averaged 14.3 points and
5.3 assists last season.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the top five were Vanderbilt's Chantelle Anderson
(42), Mississippi State's LaToya Thomas (35) and Stanford's Nicole
Powell (24), who will miss the Cardinal's Nov. 22 opener against
Rutgers because she played in a summer league game not sanctioned by
the NCAA.</TE>
<TE>   A Nov. 20 date has been set by the Nevada State Athletic
Commission for a hearing for Fernando Vargas. The former 147-pound
champion faces disciplinary action after testing positive for an
illegal steroid following his TKO loss to Oscar De La Hoya in a
September title fight.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the commission asking for leniency, Vargas concedes
the accuracy of the tests, but is still claiming he was given the
steroid without his knowledge by overzealous members of his camp.</TE>

<HD>Cowboys' McKinney Undergoes Angioplasty</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dallas Cowboy offensive lineman Jeremy McKinney has undergone a heart
procedure to correct a narrowing of an artery.</LD>
<LD>   McKinney, 26, played Sunday in Detroit, but felt shortness of
breath after flying home. The 6-foot-6, 301-pound McKinney checked
himself into an emergency room.</LD>
<LD>   Tests Monday revealed some narrowing of an artery. He had an
angioplasty procedure, which involves using a balloon to improve
dilation, to clear up the condition.</LD>
<TE>   Doctors said the procedure was a success and he is in good
condition. His prognosis is excellent, and he should be released from
the hospital by the end of the week.</TE>
<TE>   His playing status this season has not been determined. Ross
Tucker will take his spot at left guard when Dallas (3-6) returns
from a bye Nov. 17 at Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A nephew and a friend of New England Patriot running back Kevin
Faulk were being sought by police for allegedly using Faulk's sports
utility vehicle to steal a safe filled with money and marijuana in
Norwood, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Warrants have been issued for Faulk's nephew, Edward Comier, and
friend, Cisco Dwayne Perkins, both 24, on charges of breaking and
entering in the daytime and larceny, said Norwood police spokesman
Paul Bishop.</TE>
<TE>   Faulk told police he does not know the whereabouts of the two men,
who police consider fugitives. It's "totally clear" Faulk was not
involved in the crime, Bishop said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fullback Terry Jackson agreed to a two-year contract extension
with the San Francisco 49ers -- even though he won't play again this
season because of a knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, a fourth-year pro, is considered one of the NFL's top
special teams players. He's also a backup to San Francisco fullback
Fred Beasley and an emergency tailback.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson tore a ligament in his knee last month in the 49ers'
victory over Seattle. He is still on crutches after surgery that will
keep him out until next spring.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Indianapolis Colts signed Autry Denson to bolster their
injury-depleted corps of running backs.</TE>
<TE>   Edgerrin James and backup Ricky Williams are out because of
hamstring injuries, and Jim Finn wasn't effective after a mild
concussion early in Sunday's loss to Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Three backs, including Dominic Rhodes, were lost to knee injuries
in training camp.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The St. Louis Rams signed linebacker Hakim Akbar.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot, 220-pound Akbar, who spent this year's training camp
with the expansion Houston Texans, played on special teams for New
England in six of the Patriots' first nine games last season. He then
went on injured reserve in November after being in an auto accident.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati Bengal tight end Sean Brewer was put on injured reserve
because of a knee problem, his latest setback in two injury-prone
seasons. The Bengals signed tight end Chris Edmonds off their
practice squad.</TE>

<LD>Pavol Demitra had a goal and two assists as the St. Louis Blues
extended their NHL-best winning streak to nine games with a 5-2
victory over the Montreal Canadiens on Tuesday night at Montreal.</LD>
<LD>   Rookie Eric Boguniecki scored twice, and Martin Rucinsky and Doug
Weight also scored for St. Louis. Fred Brathwaite stopped 13 shots
for his fifth consecutive victory.</LD>
<LD>   The Blues, who outshot Montreal 36-15, are undefeated in 10 games

<TE>   St. Louis had a team-record 10-game winning streak last Jan. 3-23.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 2, Carolina 1 -- John LeClair scored his 300th goal
with the Flyers with 3:04 left in overtime as Philadelphia extended
its winning streak to six in a row with a victory at Raleigh, N.C.</TE>

<DH>'Gorgeous Gussie' Moran, who created a stir in 1949 by
playing in a short skirt, struggles to get by</DH>

<LD>Gussie Moran had legs that went on forever. She walked, the late
designer Ted Tinling said, as if she were tiptoeing across tennis
balls. She was a California girl with a California tan. She was a
jock, she was beautiful, it was 1949 and Gussie Moran showed her lace
panties at Wimbledon.</LD>
<LD>   "Gussie was," says Jack Kramer, part of Los Angeles tennis
royalty, "the Anna Kournikova of her time. Gussie was a beautiful
woman with a beautiful body. If Gussie had played in the era of
television, no telling what would have happened. Because, besides
everything else, Gussie could play."</LD>
<LD>   Today the top 16 women's tennis players in the world begin play at
the season-ending Home Depot WTA Championships at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   We will see Serena Williams and her tight, taut, flamboyant cat
suit, the outfit she showed off while winning the U.S. Open. Serena's
sister, Venus, already has a $40-million clothing deal with Reebok.
Serena's Puma contract is up soon. It is a safe bet Serena will earn
more than Venus.</TE>
<TE>   For wearing the lace panties, for being so daring as to display
her knees, to be seen on the cover of magazines worldwide, to find
herself playing matches where the camera flashbulbs would nearly
blind Moran during her matches, she made no money.</TE>
<TE>   Moran is 79 now and she wears her brown-gray hair in two pigtails,
held in place by rubber bands. She wears wool tights in an argyle
pattern of gray, black, pink and white. Her skirt is lightweight and
pale green with a ruffle at the bottom and her sweater is blue, red
and white. Moran has on big, round glasses tinted light blue. Moran
still defies style convention.</TE>
<TE>   In the afternoon sun, cats play in the courtyard as Moran steps
outside and for a moment all you can think is that Gloria Swanson's
Norma Desmond character has walked off Sunset Boulevard and William
Holden must be right around the corner.</TE>
<TE>   She lives in a single room in a run-down building with the cement
sagging. It is just off Melrose Avenue and behind Paramount Studios
in Hollywood. There is a mattress on the floor. Newspapers are
everywhere, for Moran loves cats and four of them have the run of her
place. On one wall are dozens of cards -- holiday cards, birthday
cards, friendship cards. On the windows are bedsheets made into
curtains. This is Moran in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   In 1949, Gussie Moran was a tennis sensation. Moran came to
Wimbledon and caused a scandal. Tinling had made for Moran a tennis
dress with a skirt so short it didn't cover the knees and, for
underneath, white panties trimmed in lace. A glimpse of those lace
panties every once in a while on the body of Moran caused Wimbledon
brass to cover their eyes and photographers from around the world to
lie on the ground so they could shoot "Gorgeous Gussie Moran" from
the bottom up.</TE>
<TE>   When Moran played that Wimbledon, tennis was still a sport for
amateurs. Moran had paid her way to the tournament for which there
was no prize money, only honor.</TE>
<TE>   When Serena Williams walked proudly onto Stadium Court at the U.S.
Open in her pink and black form-fitting leotard, after all the
gasping, Williams was compared to the daring "Gorgeous Gussie."</TE>
<TE>   Gussie lives on what little Social Security she earned from some
of her dozens of careers. She receives occasional money from an
anonymous Australian friend. She would like to come to Staples Center
to see this tournament. "But I can't afford a ticket," Moran says.</TE>
<TE>   She loves Serena's forward fashion approach. "The cat suit was
fun," Moran says. "It was attractive on Serena's body. She should
show off that body and what's wrong with having a good time with your
clothes and your body?</TE>
<TE>   "I see nothing wrong with what Anna Kournikova does. She's a
beautiful girl with a beautiful body. I love it."</TE>
<TE>   She blushes when told that Kramer compared her to Kournikova. "Oh,
no," Moran says. "I was never that attractive."</TE>
<TE>   But even now, after some face lifts that might not have been
perfectly planned, behind the skin carved deep with wrinkles that
came from all those days in the sun, on the beach, that came from her
perfect California tan, there is the outline of that beauty.</TE>
<TE>   Moran has blue eyes that sparkle, a delicate nose, an upturned
mouth.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could have a wish," Moran says, "it would be to have a face
lift."</TE>
<TE>   But no, Moran is told, that is not necessary. "Maybe not," she
says, "but I would like one."</TE>
<TE>   Author Roger Kahn, a long-time friend of Moran's, remembers his
first meeting with the glamour girl. "It was at Dodgertown in the
1950s," Kahn says. "All I saw were these legs attached to that body
attached to that head. She asked me if I would work out with her. I
said I don't play tennis but I play volleyball. So we played
volleyball."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For nearly two hours Gussie Moran tells stories.</TE>
<TE>   She tells of learning to play tennis as an 11-year-old, the
daughter of Harry and Emma, of a sound technician at Universal
Studios and a housewife. She speaks of her childhood in a big, wood,
Victorian house a block from the ocean in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they shoot commercials at that house now," Moran says.
"What I miss most about it is the water. I used to be able to run
across the street to the beach."</TE>
<TE>   Moran lost the house in the 1980s. She was a victim of rising
taxes and maybe of some bullheadedness.</TE>
<TE>   "Gussie asked for too much money," Kahn says. "She couldn't get it
sold and then they foreclosed. Gussie used to tell me, 'I always felt
a little inadequate about our house because it was wooden and all my
friends had stone houses.' That was Gussie. She had this pride and
she had a desire to live a certain way."</TE>
<TE>   Moran started taking tennis lessons in school and she developed
quickly an aptitude. She played at Santa Monica High. She was part of
traveling junior teams in Los Angeles with Kramer and Louise Brough,
who would be a Wimbledon champion.</TE>
<TE>   There were stories of how Moran would be invited to play tennis at
the home of Charlie Chaplin. "My best friends were Charlie's
children," Moran says. Greta Garbo would come by to hit with Moran,
Olivia DeHavilland traded forehands with Moran.</TE>
<TE>   In tennis, Moran was skilled but never a great champion. The depth
of women's talent in the U.S. was great and Moran is proud to have
been ranked as high as No. 4 in the U.S. She was a doubles finalist
at Wimbledon once and was a singles semifinalist at the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   Moran was 25 at the 1949 Wimbledon, coming off her best year on
the circuit. But distracted by the fuss over the panties and
uncertain how to handle the attention that came to her because of her
body instead of her skill, Moran lost in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Within two years, Moran had left the world of amateur tennis and
was enticed onto a pro tour run by Bobby Riggs.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a bad decision by Gussie," says Kramer. "Bobby matched her
against the great Pauline Betz who was, at that time, by far the best
athlete ever to play our sport and she was also most competitive.
Pauline was merciless. Not only did she beat Gussie, she tried to
outdress her.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember one time, Gussie came out at Madison Square Garden in
a gorgeous outfit. Then Pauline came out in a leopard leotard type
thing and basically outdressed Gussie in clothes, then undressed her
on the court. Really, that tour was a tragedy for Gussie. I don't
think she got much money out of it either."</TE>
<TE>   She was promised $87,000, Moran says. "I hardly saw any of that,"
she says. But Moran dismisses that time as "something I did for fun."
In her life Moran has been married three times -- "to a former
[British Royal Air Force] pilot from Jersey," she says, "the owner of
a trucking company from Buffalo and an attorney from California."
None of the marriages lasted more than two years and there were never
any children.</TE>
<TE>   After her unhappy time in the Riggs show, Moran began a
peripatetic life that took her between New York and California
several times. She toured military bases and hospitals as part of a
tour put together by Bill Tilden. She was in a chopper that crashed
while doing a USO tour in Vietnam. She did a television interview
show with Bob Kelly, voice of the Rams. She did a sports talk and
news show in New York for nearly six years. She came back to Los
Angeles and did an afternoon television show with Bob Kennedy. It was
called "Sundown." Guests such as Rosemary Clooney and Ray Charles
made the program a hit.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, Kahn says, Moran was a great entertainer. "She had a
lovely townhouse on the upper East Side, two stories, and she'd have
the most interesting parties. She was very bright, very intelligent.
We would talk literature, poetry, sports. She had a mouth on her and
a great sense of humor. But Gussie liked to live a certain lifestyle,
maybe a bit above her means."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, Moran put together a clothing design company with a
friend. "My clothes were in Saks Fifth Avenue and Bullocks," Moran
says. "But then some things went wrong and I lost my money. I
invested my own money. But everybody got paid back, they did."</TE>
<TE>   She taught tennis at a Lake Encino club started by former great
Alice Marble. She was a field representative for fabric manufacturer
Kordel and even wrote a column for Tennis magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Money never stayed in Moran's bank account for long and by the
1980s she was working at the Los Angeles Zoo in the gift shop. In
1991, her final job was as a clerk at a clothing store on Wilshire.
"I lasted three and a half months," she says. "Then I quit and I
haven't been able to get a job since."</TE>
<TE>   Moran speaks of having more than one abortion and tells a horrific
tale of being gang-raped during a 1975 centennial celebration in
Santa Monica during a performance by Lawrence Welk and his orchestra.
She recalls only being rescued from a dumpster by two bums who took
her to a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "I never heard her tell that story," Kahn says, "but I don't doubt
it happened."</TE>
<TE>   Moran still walks with assuredness, with the rolling gait of an
athlete and complains only of memory lapses that followed the Vietnam
chopper crash, and some arthritis in her hands.</TE>
<TE>   She voted Tuesday and proudly displayed her "I Voted" sticker. She
eagerly discusses the broadcasting pluses of John McEnroe and Mary
Carillo. "I love how they speak their minds," she says.</TE>
<TE>   There is loneliness, Moran says. She has no immediate family, only
some cousins. "I write them," she says, "but they don't write back."</TE>
<TE>   Kahn often receives long letters from Moran and he says that
friends sometimes hesitate to see Moran because they want to help
her. "And Gussie has the pride of a great athlete. She does not want,
or expect, help," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Says Moran: "I know what people have been saying about me, I've
heard it for 40 years. They say I'm a hooker, that I'm a drunk, that
I'm insane. Well, I'm not insane, but maybe I'm eccentric. I'm not a
drunk, though I do take a drink. And I've been promiscuous, but I've
never been a hooker."</TE>
<TE>   Moran takes joy in seeing the young women tennis players proudly
displaying their athletic bodies. "I was not very comfortable doing
so," Moran says. "Maybe it would be different now."</TE>
<TE>   She just shakes her head no when asked if she ever thinks about
the money she might have made and no again when asked if she feels
she was born too soon, that she might have had a very different life
as an attractive player in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "My only regret," Moran says, "is this: I was about 16 and entered
in a local tournament. I had my driver's license and I wouldn't let
my mother drive me. She wanted to very much but I wanted my
independence. I realize now that my mother, who was a housewife, had
only a few chances to leave her world and be out, meet people, see
different things.</TE>
<TE>   "I see now that I was being quite selfish and to this day I have
carried tremendous guilt about that Sunday afternoon."</TE>
<TE>   There are tears in Moran's eyes.</TE>

<HD>According to Bledsoe, Steinberg Fumbled Snap</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buffalo quarterback Drew Bledsoe said he came to Los Angeles
"voluntarily" Tuesday, as if everyone in Buffalo at this time of year
wouldn't come voluntarily to Los Angeles if given the chance.</LD>
<LD>   Bledsoe took a seat on the witness stand in Los Angeles federal
court, correctly spelled his name and the attorney seemed relieved.
I'm guessing Terry Bradshaw might have been one of his previous
clients.</LD>
<LD>   Bledsoe was here to detail his falling out with super-agent Jerry
Maguire, a.k.a., Leigh Steinberg, but the attorney who called him to
town wanted to know how long he has been married, as if he couldn't
have asked that on the way from the airport.</LD>
<TE>   Well, you know how these things go -- you better know if the glove
fits before asking someone to try it on -- because right away Bledsoe
couldn't even tell the jury for sure whether he has been married
"five or six years," which had to leave the good citizens on the jury
wondering about the strength of his recollection the rest of the
morning.</TE>
<TE>   And I don't know about his fallout with Steinberg, but that should
be some kind of chilly discussion with the wife when he gets back to
Buffalo, and she wants to know which is it? Five or six years?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IN 1993 Bledsoe was the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft, and Steinberg
was his agent. But now Steinberg is suing his former partner, David
Dunn, for $40 million for allegedly swiping most of his clients,
including Bledsoe. (From what I can tell, there was no attempt to
steal Ryan Leaf.)</TE>
<TE>   The jury is expected to begin deliberations this week, and while
Steinberg might get a chunk of money, his reputation as sports agent
icon appears lost.</TE>
<TE>   I guess it just depends if you think it's damaging to your good
name if your own clients consider you a drunken fool, a womanizer and
a slob.</TE>
<TE>   One of the employees, who broke with Steinberg to follow Dunn,
figured Steinberg would not fight to hold the firm together if it
meant ruining his reputation in a public forum. "If we wanted to,"
wrote Brian Murphy in an internal memo now in evidence, "we could rip
apart his marriage, his reputation, and his career."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   STEINBERG PRESSED the point, however, and the ripping commenced,
capped off by Bledsoe's appearance in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe dressed in New England blue and, probably wishing he were
still playing for the Patriots, began by making eye contact with the
jury, earning a smile from three of the four women there. I guess we
know who thinks Tom Brady is better.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn's attorney started asking Bledsoe questions, and when Bledsoe
mentioned he had played in three Pro Bowls, the attorney asked,
"What's a Pro Bowl?" This is what happens when you don't have a pro
football team in town.</TE>
<TE>   When the assault on Steinberg's reputation began, Bledsoe revealed
that several years into their relationship, Steinberg talked to
Bledsoe only once or twice a year. I might've asked Bledsoe why he
didn't call Steinberg more, but Steinberg's attorney apparently
didn't want to ruin his chances of getting Bledsoe's autograph.</TE>
<TE>   I blew that in the hallway during a break. Bledsoe was telling
someone he was disappointed losing to the Patriots on Sunday, and I
told him I was thrilled because Brady was my fantasy team QB. I don't
think he'll be calling me much this year either.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BACK IN court, Bledsoe talked about his wedding reception, an
inebriated Steinberg spilling food on himself and family, asking,
"Who the hell is that guy?" I thought Steinberg's attorney would
object: "Everyone knows that's Jerry Maguire," but he just sat there
as if he were listening to Bledsoe call a play.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe said Steinberg raided his hotel minibar once, and he
seemed bitter about that. I know hotels overcharge for using the
minibar and I'm surprised Steinberg's attorney didn't explain to the
jury why Bledsoe was so upset.</TE>
<TE>   Then Bledsoe said he had to apologize to the wife of a good friend
after Steinberg allegedly told this woman he wanted to have sex with
her in Bledsoe's home. I guess it's all right to be a tattletale.</TE>
<TE>   "Over a period of time I felt my association with Leigh was
becoming embarrassing to me," Bledsoe said in explaining why he
jumped to Dunn after Dunn left Steinberg. Dunn then negotiated a
contract with New England, which at the time was the largest contract
in NFL history.</TE>
<TE>   Now as we have learned from so many trials, there are always two
sides to every story, and I know I'd like to know Steinberg's
response to testimony he twice licked the faces of women at social
events and told someone "I want to eat your leg."</TE>
<TE>   More than anything, though, I'd like to know why one of the most
successful sports agents of all time lost control of his empire. And
if true, himself.</TE>
<TE>   Any time you can give a bad name to agents, you've outdone
yourself.</TE>
<TE>   I know Jerry Maguire had to start over from rock bottom, but I
can't believe this is the sequel that Steinberg had in mind.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IF THE U.S. defeats Costa Rica in soccer tonight in Seattle, the
women will play in the Rose Bowl on Saturday night for the Gold Cup,
and the last time the U.S. women's national team won a title in the
Rose Bowl, Brandi Chastain tore off her shirt. It will be interesting
to see what she does for an encore. OK, so to be honest, it will be
interesting to hear what she does for an encore.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Niko:</TE>
<TE>   "You always bag on people for not responding to you, but you don't
respond very often to my e-mails."</TE>

<LD>SEATTLE -- Mexico and the United States can secure their places in
the fourth FIFA Women's World Cup in China in 2003 with victories
over Canada and Costa Rica, respectively, tonight in the semifinals
of the CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup.</LD>
<LD>   The Americans and Canadians are favored, but Mexico's Coach
Leonardo Cuellar remains optimistic that his team can surprise
Canada, coached by Even Pellerud, who led Norway to the 1995 Women's
World Cup title.</LD>
<LD>   The Canadians have outscored their opponents, 23-1, in the Gold
Cup.</LD>
<TE>   "We knew coming into this competition that the possibility was
there that we would face Canada," Cuellar said. "Obviously, they have
great momentum. They have a great mixture of experienced players and
some youth players from [September's under-19] World Championship.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Canada's program is growing very, very fast. It's very
obvious also, by the results that they've been getting against the
United States, that they're getting a lot closer.</TE>
<TE>   "So we respect them a lot. We know it's going to be a battle. But
it's not a World Series of seven games, it's one game. We hope to get
them on a bad day and for us a good day."</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy Cuts Waibel</TE>
<TE>   Clearing salary cap room as well as roster space, the Galaxy
waived reserve defender Craig Waibel, paving the way for recently
signed South Korean defender Hong Myung Bo.</TE>
<TE>   Waibel, 27, signed with the Galaxy as a discovery pick May 4,
2001, and he started 13 of the 26 matches in which he appeared and
had three assists.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy Steps Down</TE>
<TE>   Mick McCarthy resigned Tuesday as Ireland's coach, less than five
months after leading the team into the second round of the World Cup,
where it lost to Spain on penalty kicks.</TE>
<TE>   The future fell into doubt for McCarthy, 43, when he became
embroiled in a furious spat with Ireland's captain, Roy Keane, and
sent him home from the tournament in Korea and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Europe's longest-serving national coach later came under increased
pressure when Ireland, without Keane, lost consecutive games to
Russia and Switzerland in qualifying play for the 2004 European
Championship in Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy compiled a record of 29-19-20.</TE>
<TE>   Basel Prevails</TE>
<TE>   Switzerland's FC Basel moved to within a point of qualifying for
the final 16 of the European Champions League when it defeated
Russian champion Spartak Moscow, 2-0, in snow and below-freezing
temperatures in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   Goals by Argentine strikers Hernan Rossi and Christian Jimenez
earned the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Basel can advance to the final 16 by beating or tying Liverpool
next week.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's Roster Is Set</TE>
<TE>   Mario "Lobo" Zagallo, the 71-year-old four-time World Cup winner
who Monday was hauled out of retirement to coach Brazil against South
Korea, selected 19 European-based players to his roster for the game
in Seoul on Nov. 20.</TE>
<TE>   Zagallo selected four players who narrowly failed to make Brazil's
2002 World Cup team: forwards Amoroso and Franca, midfielders Flavio
Conceicao and Juninho Pernambuco, and team captain Emerson, who was
injured on the eve of Korea/Japan '02.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo is part of the squad, but Rivaldo asked to be left off for
personal reasons. Three Brazilian-based players will be added.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Portugal's soccer federation said it will select a
foreign coach to lead its team, increasing speculation that the man
poised to take over the Euro 2004 host country is Luiz Felipe
Scolari, who in June led Brazil to its fifth World Cup title.</TE>
<TE>   Menotti Is Fired</TE>
<TE>   Cesar Luis Menotti, 63, who coached Argentina to victory in the
1978 World Cup, was fired as coach of Rosario Central after a series
of bad results that have left the team in danger of being relegated
from the Argentine first division.</TE>

<PH>WTA CHAMPIONSHIPS AT STAPLES CENTER: TODAY-MONDAY</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>They Have Pluck of Draw</HD>
<DH>Davenport, Seles overcame adversity to set up their meeting
in the first round.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Dillman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Close friends Monica Seles and Lindsay Davenport have shared plenty
of memories through their long-and-winding careers -- Fed Cup
victories, playing one another in the Wimbledon quarterfinals in 2000
and meeting in four tournament finals. They've met in competition 11
times, Davenport having won nine times. They even have the same
agent.</LD>
<LD>   Their first-round match in the Home Depot WTA Championships
tonight at Staples Center, however, has different implications. For
one thing, the presence of Davenport and the sixth-seeded Seles in
the season finale was hardly a sure thing at the start of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Then, the tournament was scheduled for Munich and Seles has been
steadfast in her refusal to play in Germany since her 1993 stabbing
in Hamburg. Davenport required surgery in January for a potential
career-ending knee injury. She was sidelined until July and qualified
for the $3-million event with an ambitious schedule, playing three
consecutive indoor events in Europe. Though Davenport made the
16-player singles field, she is unseeded and could have landed in the
draw next to No. 1 Serena Williams or No. 2 Venus Williams.</LD>
<TE>   "I knew I was going to get a tough draw in the position of not
being seeded," Davenport said. "Obviously, I hoped not to play one of
the Williams [sisters] in the first round. Even Monica, I think
that's a tough draw. There would have been some other players I would
have much rather preferred to play."</TE>
<TE>   Seles has been training in Los Angeles with her coach, Mike Sell,
for about a month, off the circuit, in part, because of a foot
problem. She lost to Eleni Daniilidou of Greece in the semifinals at
Bahia, Brazil, in September and has not played a match since then.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always played well indoors," Seles said. "I like it. I
always played well at the Championships in New York, so hopefully I
can continue that momentum here. I'm a little bit nervous because I
haven't played any tournaments a couple of months leading into it,
but to go to Europe for one or two tournaments, I didn't want to do
it."</TE>
<TE>   Davenport has struggled with an injured shin and resumed
practicing at full speed only a few days ago.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Davenport-Seles match is the marquee pairing of the
tournament's first night -- combined they have 12 Grand Slam titles,
nine for Seles, three for Davenport -- Venus Williams could face a
difficult test against Patty Schnyder of Switzerland. Williams has
not lost to Schnyder in four matches but has played only once since
losing in the U.S. Open final to her younger sister Serena. In the
day session, fourth-seeded Justine Henin of Belgium opens against
2000 semifinalist Elena Dementieva of Russia, followed by No. 5 Kim
Clijsters of Belgium against Chanda Rubin. Henin has not lost to
Dementieva in two matches, and Clijsters is 2-0 against Rubin. Rubin,
however, is the only player to have defeated Serena Williams since
Williams lost to Henin in the final of the German Open in early May.</TE>
<TE>   The season-ending event moved to Los Angeles after a year in
Germany. It had previously been held in New York since 1979.
Certainly, continuity is going to be important in educating the
public, Davenport said. And, admittedly, there is some confusion
about the status of the tournament in the overall picture.
Qualification starts with the first tournament in January, and the
race to the championships is not determined by the rankings, which
are used by the Grand Slams and WTA tournaments for seeding purposes.</TE>
<TE>   "The mind-set of tennis, in the United States anyway, is that it
kind of ends at the [U.S] Open," Davenport said. "It's trying to
educate all the tennis fans, that we play all these tournaments
indoors to build toward the end-of-year tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it takes any tournament awhile to grow its fan base
and get it roots down and get the public to understand what it is --
that it's our fifth major. They probably don't understand it. The
fans in New York did. We were there [more than] 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "But when you keep moving it around, it's hard for the local fans
to know what it is. A lot of people will say, 'I'm going to Staples
Center, not quite sure what it is and who is playing.' That's when
you've got to establish a foundation and keep it here a number of
years. The first few years will be the toughest years, but hopefully
you get through those and get it bigger and bigger as the years go
on."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain, who was heckled and
driven to tears by a fan during the Fed Cup final in the Canary
Islands against Slovakia, has withdrawn because of an injured thigh.
Slovakia beat Spain, 3-1, to win its first Fed Cup title, and
Sanchez-Vicario had been scheduled to play doubles with Daniela
Hantuchova of Slovakia in Los Angeles. Replacing them are Katarina
Srebotnik and Tina Krizan of Slovenia.</TE>

<HD>Recruiting Hoping for Boost</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two victories in a row improved the disposition of everyone around
UCLA. Randy Taylor, who heads Bruin recruiting, is no exception.</LD>
<LD>   "Winning has a great deal to do with successful recruiting,"
Taylor said. "Guys want to play for a team that looks like it is
going to win, now and in the future."</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins have commitments from only four players, fewer than
half the number they've had by November in recent years. Recruiting
experts have expressed alarm, suggesting that UCLA's .500 record the
last three years is turning off blue-chip prospects.</LD>
<TE>   However, Taylor believes the Bruins eventually will corral as many
quality players as in recent years. UCLA has 16 more scholarships to
offer. The focus is on defensive linemen. "A lot of kids want to take
their [recruiting] trips before they decide," he said. "We've got a
good mix of young and old players on this team. The factors that
enabled us to bring in top recruiting classes the last several years
still apply."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Ryan Smith is in limbo. He knows his ankle hurts. He
knows it has affected his performance. But he isn't getting
satisfactory answers.</TE>
<TE>   MRI results Tuesday revealed fluid on the ankle, but little else.
He suffered the injury last year, played several games in pain and
had surgery in April to remove scar tissue.</TE>
<TE>   Smith has only five catches and sat out Saturday against
Washington. He will not play against Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be a team player and play through it, but I did that
last year and look where it got me," he said. "I'm fed up with pain.
And I'm fed up with being mediocre."</TE>
<TE>   Smith, a junior, will decide whether to play again this season
after visiting a foot specialist.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   C.J. Niusulu has until his next court appearance Nov. 26 to
negotiate a plea bargain on felony battery charges. If the charges
are reduced to a misdemeanor, he would be suspended for one game. A
felony conviction would result in his dismissal from the team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was election day, and injured quarterback Cory Paus sat in the
bleachers at Spaulding Field and considered a career in politics.</TE>
<TE>   "That's really what I want to do, maybe in 20 years," he said. "I
have some definite ideas. I think you'll see me run for office."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reserve quarterback Matt Moore has been promised that he will play
one series in the first half against Arizona. Moore and starter Drew
Olson are getting equal repetitions in practice.... Defensive tackle
Ryan Boschetti (shin) missed practice for the second day in a row....
Cornerback Matt Ware (hamstring) practiced and was upgraded to
probable.</TE>

<LD>It's become a nightly ritual after USC finishes practice.</LD>
<LD>   All-American senior safety Troy Polamalu takes freshman safety
Mike Ross to the far end of the field and tosses a football back and
forth during 15 minutes of one-on-one instruction and conversation.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody in life needs a mentor and everyone needs to be a
teacher," Polamalu said Tuesday. "I think Mike can be one of the
greatest safeties to play here."</LD>
<TE>   Ross, who attended high school in St. Petersburg, Fla., said he
approached Polamalu last week and requested his undivided attention.</TE>
<TE>   "I was kind of joking when I said, 'Mentor me, tutor me, teach
me,' " Ross said. "The next day, Troy says, 'Mike, come on.'</TE>
<TE>   "It always helps when you learn from the best, someone that plays
with that much enthusiasm but is still so humble."</TE>
<TE>   Polamalu is still coping with the high right ankle sprain that he
suffered against Washington State on Oct. 5. He had X-rays Tuesday
morning after rest during the bye week did little to ease the
discomfort he felt during games against Washington and Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   The X-rays showed no further damage, but Polamalu said he expects
to play with pain the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Pete Carroll said Polamalu's mobility in practice will be
limited.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to barely make it to each game, all the way down the
stretch," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cornerback Marcell Allmond got his first start -- and his first
test -- against Washington's Reggie Williams, a 6-foot-4, 200-pound
receiver.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday against Stanford, Allmond will match up against 6-7,
245-pound receiver Teyo Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Allmond, 6 feet and 200 pounds, said he learned from his mistakes
against Williams, who caught seven passes for 134 yards and a
touchdown against USC.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't ever give up on a player that good," Allmond said. "They're
playing every play. Even when you think they're not playing, they're
playing. Reggie was real good at that and got me on a touchdown."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Partly cloudy is the forecast for Palo Alto on Saturday, but the
Trojans practiced with a wet ball to prepare quarterback Carson
Palmer and receivers for the possibility of rain .... Fullback Chad
Pierson, who sat out the Oregon game because of a sore Achilles,
practiced and might be available against Stanford, Carroll said....
Senior defensive lineman Bernard Riley returned to practice after
sitting out Monday's workout because of a personal matter. Riley said
he is not overly concerned about playing with a broken left thumb.
"It's not a knee or a wheel," he said.</TE>

<HD>Middle School Stresses a 4th R -- Recreation</HD>
<DH>The private Santa Barbara campus uses the outdoors to teach
students life skills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At Santa Barbara Middle School, afternoon classes are anything but
reading, writing and arithmetic.</LD>
<LD>   When the bell rings at 1:30 p.m., kids ditch their notebooks and
pencils for mountain bikes and helmets, surfboards and wetsuits,
skateboards and kneepads.</LD>
<LD>   It's part of the independent school's outdoor education program --
one of only a few like it in the country. In addition to daily
classes in various sports and outdoor activities, students take part
in three weeklong biking expeditions each year, in which they learn
important life skills such as teamwork, leadership and respect for
nature, educators say.</LD>
<TE>   Cumulatively, Santa Barbara Middle School students have logged
more than 1 million miles on their bikes since the program started in
1976.</TE>
<TE>   "Are they learning math? Absolutely," said Headmaster Stephen
Lane, a former competitive road and track cyclist who also teaches
science. "But the question is, can we do more for them than just
teach them math?"</TE>
<TE>   Another unusual factor is that the school covers only the sixth to
ninth grades. That way, it can cater to children going through the
often-rough middle years of adolescence. Its small size -- about 167
students -- means everyone knows each other, and relationships with
teachers are more friendly than authoritative (they are addressed by
their first names).</TE>
<TE>   Instead of sending vulnerable eighth-graders directly to high
school, which is the way of most intermediate campuses, the school
keeps them through ninth grade, when they take on a leadership role
for the rest of the student body.</TE>
<TE>   "By 10th grade, they have a much better sense of themselves, and
now they are ready to succeed," Lane said.</TE>
<TE>   But the key component of the school's philosophy is the outdoor
classes, Lane said. While every youth is unique, most kids 12 to 15
have at least one thing in common: boundless energy.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these kids are growing inches by the day -- it physically
hurts for them to sit in chairs at desks for six hours," said teacher
Jim Brady. "We use that changing energy instead of fighting it."</TE>
<TE>   All academic work takes place in morning learning blocks, from
8:20 a.m. to 12:15 p.m., after which students break for lunch. The
total weekly class time is on par with most public schools, Lane
said, but it frees up the afternoons for students to take elective
classes ranging from art and music to bike maintenance and
mountaineering.</TE>
<TE>   On Fridays, they get to leave campus for classes at the local
skateboard park, surfing lessons at the beach and biking trips on
nearby trails.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, all the school's students and teachers returned from a
biking and kayaking expedition in Morro Bay. In the spring, they will
climb Mt. Whitney, camp in Los Padres National Forest east of Santa
Barbara and bike through the American Southwest touring Anasazi
ruins.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of learning that goes on," Lane said. Students
confirm that notion.</TE>
<TE>   Wit Jette, 14, a fast-talking ninth-grader with a pierced lip and
a tattoo around her arm, is captain of the "bike monkeys," the crew
of students who tune up the students' mountain bikes before trips and
repair them on the road. On campus, they run their own bike repair
shop with help from teachers.</TE>
<TE>   On the trips, Wit says, she has learned how to mentor timid
sixth-graders and manage groups of people -- not to mention the ins
and outs of fixing disc brakes.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives you the mental capacity to deal with things you've never
done before," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron Casey, 14, is one of six Santa Barbara Middle School
students who traveled on bicycles with two teachers and a young
filmmaker across America this summer in the tracks of Lewis and
Clark's historic expedition. The group, which called its trek the
"Corps of Rediscovery," was the first to use newly created maps
following the route of the explorers' cross-country expedition, which
began in 1804.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron rode his bike for four months -- close to 5,000 miles --
across nine mountain passes and through four national parks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great accomplishment," said the shy ninth-grader. "It
makes you appreciate everything that's out there, and gives you a
different perspective."</TE>
<TE>   The school -- housed in a century-old Catholic seminary behind the
Santa Barbara Mission -- was founded in 1974. The outdoor education
tradition has evolved with the times, from hiking to road cycling to
mountain biking. The only rule is that the learning remain
"experiential," Lane said.</TE>
<TE>   The middle school's academic program is accredited by the
California Assn. of Independent Schools, which encompasses about 180
private schools statewide. Most of the students at the Santa Barbara
campus go on to public high schools and then four-year colleges. But
because the middle school is private, the experience comes at a cost:
$14,000 a year in tuition. About one-fourth of the students are on
financial aid, and the tuition includes the cost of all the trips.</TE>
<TE>   In line with its focus on outdoor sports, the school puts a high
premium on being environmentally conscious. On all the water
fountains are neon green signs that say, "Count your blessings: This
water brought to you by the Lake Cachuma and Gibraltar reservoirs."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Friday, teacher Kelly Rosenheim dumped out a can of
garbage in front of students to show them all of the plastic,
aluminum and paper that could have been recycled. For a week, she
said, a group of "recycling ninjas" would patrol waste baskets.</TE>
<TE>   Next week, the school's ninth-graders will board a 90-foot boat to
explore the Channel Islands, while doing reports on ecological issues
ranging from fisheries to kelp forests.</TE>
<TE>   Parent Pam Hull, whose eighth-grade daughter, Emma, attends the
school, said she has been happy with the mix of academics and outdoor
trips.</TE>
<TE>   "You have them go through a rigorous physical program at a time in
their lives when it's really important to develop self-confidence, so
they have a direction and sense of themselves before they go off to
high school," she said. "We're trying to give them power to make good
choices."</TE>

<HD>Defendant Denies Placing Rose Petals</HD>
<DH>D.A. theorizes woman accused of killing her husband may
have used motif from 'American Beauty.' She faces life in prison if
guilty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Silver</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Kristin Rossum, the former county toxicologist accused of fatally
poisoning her husband, maintained her composure through a fourth and
likely final day on the witness stand Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The 26-year-old defendant repeated denials that either she or her
former lover and boss at the San Diego County medical examiner's
office had anything to do with the killing of Greg de Villers two
years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Attempting to bolster her defense, Rossum denied that she was the
source of the rose petals sprinkled over her husband's body on the
night of the murder. The single rose she bought at a grocery store
the day of the killing was a different color than the petals strewn
over the corpse, she testified.</LD>
<TE>   Under questioning by Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan Goldstein, Rossum said
she bought a yellow rose with peach tips the afternoon of Nov. 6,
2000. Red rose petals covered De Villers' body when it was found that
night.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution has theorized that the rose petals sprinkled on
the body may evoke fantasy sequences from "American Beauty," which is
Rossum's favorite film.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way that the rose petals on Greg could have been the
yellow rose that I bought," Rossum told the court Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein then asked if Rossum called 911 early last month from a
hotel on Pacific Coast Highway because she had just learned that
prosecutors found a record of the single rose she bought the day De
Villers died.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedics found her that day lying face down on a bed in her
hotel room. Rossum disputed the prosecutor's suggestion that she was
frightened that new evidence against her had been uncovered. She said
she had muscle spasms and an anxiety attack because of nervousness
over her upcoming trial, not because of the revelation about the
rose.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole process was starting," she said. "I was scared to
death."</TE>
<TE>   Rossum is accused of killing her husband with the painkiller
fentanyl, which is often used to treat cancer patients and as an
anesthetic in surgery. An audit after De Villers' death found
fentanyl and methamphetamine missing from the medical examiner's
office.</TE>
<TE>   Rossum has admitted she relapsed into her methamphetamine habit
shortly before her husband died, but has denied she took the drug
from the toxicology lab. She has acknowledged carrying on an affair
with her former boss at the medical examiner's office, Michael
Robertson. He was not charged with any wrongdoing and has returned to
his native Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Rossum has said she believes De Villers took his own life because
he was despondent over their impending separation. But prosecutors
allege Rossum made De Villers' death appear a suicide to cover up his
murder.</TE>
<TE>   He was found with a copy of the couple's wedding photo propped up
next to his head, a shredded note from Robertson on the kitchen
table, and Rossum's diary nearby.</TE>
<TE>   The journal, one of four she said she kept during that time, never
mentioned her affair.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you telling us that you didn't lie in your journal?"
Goldstein asked.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the journal entries I wrote had the purpose of
expressing my feelings, but also that if Greg read it he would
understand," Rossum answered.</TE>
<TE>   After Goldstein finished his cross-examination, Rossum's attorney
showed her a series of photographs of the defendant and her husband,
taken in the days before his death.</TE>
<TE>   Rossum became weepy on seeing the photos, as she has several times
since taking the stand Thursday. Goldstein asked Rossum why she cried
on the witness stand only when she saw pictures of De Villers.
Goldstein pointed out that she had had the pictures for two years and
was the one who supplied them to her defense lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to see my Greg," Rossum responded.</TE>
<TE>   Closing arguments in the trial, which began in mid-October, are
expected to begin today. If convicted, Rossum could face life in
prison without the possibility of parole.</TE>

<LD>A California Highway Patrol officer was wounded and a suspect killed
Tuesday in a shootout that closed southbound lanes of California 101
in San Luis Obispo County for six hours.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Jason McEwen, a seven-year CHP veteran, was assisting
Caltrans workers when he "initiated an enforcement stop" involving
the suspect, said CHP Officer Joe Cashdan. A struggle ensued, and
McEwen sustained a gunshot wound to his left hand. McEwen returned
fire and killed the suspect, Cashdan said.</LD>

<HD>Activist Takes Break From Tree-Sitting to Cast a Ballot</HD>
<DH>Man trying to save an oak leaves for five hours, but
another holds his spot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carol Chambers</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After spending five days in a tree, activist John Quigley took a
brief timeout from his campaign to save the ancient oak near Santa
Clarita to vote in Tuesday's general election.</LD>
<LD>   Quigley climbed down about 11 a.m. from his perch 60 feet off the
ground, then drove home to Pacific Palisades to cast his ballot. By 4
p.m., however, he was back up in the tree. He says he'll remain there
until he's certain the 400-year-old oak can be saved.</LD>
<LD>   Quigley, 42, has joined local environmentalists in their effort to
spare the tree, which is slated for removal so that Pico Canyon Road
can be widened from two to four lanes to accommodate future
development. The project was approved by the county.</LD>
<TE>   "It's important that this tree be saved because it's a symbol of
everything that's already been lost here," he said, referring to the
area's explosive development. "At some point you have to draw the
line and say, 'Stop.' For me, it starts with one tree."</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first time Quigley has gone out on a limb. He said
he spent three weeks in a tree during the mid-1990s as part of a
successful bid to save a British Columbia rainforest.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Clarita, area residents have been stopping by since last
Friday to show their support for Quigley, including Barbara Walker
and Carolyn Wolf of Valencia, who opted to "go see the man in the
tree" Tuesday instead of a movie.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what they've done in this valley with all the development
is sickening," Wolf said. "But I couldn't do this ... not without my
Starbucks every morning."</TE>
<TE>   Added Walker: "These people have a passion. You really have to
admire them for that."</TE>
<TE>   Friends, area residents and others have offered to sit in for
Quigley when necessary.</TE>
<TE>   One woman said she would climb the tree even though she's afraid
of heights, because she wants her future grandchildren to be able to
enjoy the oaks. Reseda resident David Creech, 41, took over the perch
while Quigley voted.</TE>
<TE>   Although the road-widening project is in an unincorporated area
outside Santa Clarita city limits, the City Council scheduled a study
session Tuesday night to consider asking county officials to scale
down or reroute the road.</TE>
<TE>   Developers of Stevenson Ranch have promised to await the outcome
of Tuesday's meeting before taking action about the tree, protesters
said.</TE>

<HD>Eye in the Sky Keeps Watch on Coast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth R. Weiss</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kenneth Adelman leans from the side of his helicopter -- the side
without a door. His taut seat belt is all that's holding him in as he
snaps pictures of the coastline 500 feet below. At the controls, his
wife, Gabrielle, brings the nose up to slow their air speed.</LD>
<LD>   It's a high wire act for a cause. For the past three months, this
retired high-tech mogul has been photographing every inch of the
1,150-mile California coastline for one purpose: to help protect it.</LD>
<LD>   "I've seen the beauty of the natural coastline and the destruction
that man has brought. By showing both to the public, I hope to change
people's attitudes that the coast is a valuable resource that we
ought to conserve."</LD>
<TE>   That means snapping pictures of dramatic cliffs and white crescent
beaches unblemished by the hand of man. It also means capturing
images of illegal development inside gated seaside communities or
freeze-framing bulldozers pushing around rocks or sand without
permits.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Adelman's merger of high technology and environmental
activism has provided the California Coastal Commission with enough
photographic evidence to cite the developers of a golf course in Half
Moon Bay for building an illegal sea wall.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists say the pictures -- 10,000 so far -- provide an
invaluable tool.</TE>
<TE>   "It will revolutionize coastal advocacy," said Susan Jordan of the
League for Coastal Protection. "There's nothing like a picture of our
beautiful coastline to tell a story."</TE>
<TE>   Adelman began taking aerial photos several years ago at the
suggestion of Mark Massara, the Sierra Club's manager of California
coastal programs.</TE>
<TE>   Now, thanks to Adelman's work, Massara said: "Every single day,
I'm finding new questions and forwarding these to the Coastal
Commission's enforcement division."</TE>
<TE>   Massara added that "Builders and savvy property owners know that
the Coastal Commission has no effective way to monitor illegal
coastal development and in many ways, enforce it. Now we've got
photographic proof."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, property rights advocates, such as the Pacific Legal
Foundation's Harold Johnson, have condemned the project as nothing
more than "video-toting vigilantes."</TE>
<TE>   "My concern is that this will lead to a new orgy of nit-picking by
the Coastal Commission," Johnson said. Furthermore, he said, he has
received calls from oceanfront homeowners about pictures of their
property on the Web site californiacoast line.org. They complain that
the photos invade their privacy.</TE>
<TE>   Adelman is not deterred by the critics.</TE>
<TE>   "What we've seen happening here is that private property advocates
use the cloak of privacy to disguise illegal or questionable
activity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Adelman said the point of his project is to document the coast,
not to single out anyone's house. "If someone wants to move their
home," he said, "I'd be willing to re-shoot that stretch of beach and
remove the old photo of their house from the Web site."</TE>
<TE>   The project serves his twin passions: flying and environmental
activism.</TE>
<TE>   Retired at 39, Adelman has plenty of time -- and money -- for
both.</TE>
<TE>   A Caltech graduate who co-founded two software companies during
the high-tech boom of the 1990s, Adelman sold them before the bust --
one to Cisco for about $110 million and the second to Nokia for $35
million.</TE>
<TE>   When he and his wife are not in the helicopter, the Santa Cruz
County residents can often be found flying one of Adelman's four
fixed-wing aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   "We were looking for excuses to fly," he said. "And if we can do
some good, so much the better."</TE>
<TE>   With his images, he said, "The public can see and know the coast.
They won't love it unless they know it. They won't protect it unless
they love it."</TE>
<TE>   His photos of San Simeon Point, which were made into posters and
postcards, helped environmentalists prod the Coastal Commission into
preserving the area and rejecting Hearst Corp.'s proposal to built a
golf course resort in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   It was on another of these missions, as he describes his airborne
errands for the Sierra Club's Massara, that he snapped pictures of
the sea wall built by a developer in Half Moon Bay without a permit.</TE>
<TE>   Sea walls, besides protecting property, can hasten beach erosion
and block public access to the shore.</TE>
<TE>   After Massara presented Adelman's photos of the sea wall to the
Coastal Commission, the developer agreed to tear down most of the
rock wall and build a $200,000 public stairway to the beach.</TE>
<TE>   "The photographs clearly made an impact," said Peter Douglas, the
commission's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to get out there, and we wouldn't have seen it
otherwise. As soon as we saw the photographs, it was clear we had to
act."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping the helicopter aloft costs Adelman $250 an hour, and after
flying a number of missions at Massara's behest, Adelman concluded
that it would be more efficient simply to start photographing the
coast from one end to the other.</TE>
<TE>   Two stretches remain. One is the fog-shrouded coast between Fort
Bragg and Bodega Bay. The other is Vandenberg Air Force Base, which
has yet to grant Adelman access to its restricted airspace.</TE>
<TE>   Although he has shot virtually the entire coast, he plans to do it
again in two years to document changes.</TE>
<TE>   On their most recent sortie, the Adelmans flew last week from
Santa Barbara Municipal Airport to the Mexican border. She piloted
the helicopter while he hung out the left side, pointing his digital
Nikon D1x at the coast below.</TE>
<TE>   Adelman considers his photos more evidence than art. He doesn't
worry about the finer points of composition. This is reconnaissance
work, firing off a frame every three seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The Adelmans fly past Santa Barbara harbor, past the strawberry
fields of Oxnard and the multimillion-dollar homes of Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   "What's your airspeed?" Adelman asks without looking up from the
camera. The pilot knows she's flying too fast for the photographer to
do his work. She slows to a hover.</TE>
<TE>   Flying so low -- usually 500 feet -- along the coast can be
complicated.</TE>
<TE>   Adelman has called ahead to get permission to fly through
restricted airspace around airports and military bases. The busiest
spot is Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Gabrielle Adelman edges up carefully to LAX and radios ahead to
get clearance for the photographic fly-by.</TE>
<TE>   An important-sounding voice tells her to wait. The seconds tick
by. A minute, then two.</TE>
<TE>   The skies around LAX suddenly become eerily quiet. Not an airliner
in the sky. The radio crackles and the important-sounding voice
returns. Clearance is granted. Jumbo jets remain lined up on the
taxiways as the tiny red Robinson R44 helicopter trundles by at a
mere 40 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Adelman hardly notices. He's busy shooting the beach
below.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my left arm is ready to freeze and fall off," he says
into the mouthpiece of his headset. It's hard to hear him because of
the whooshing wind buffeting the microphone.</TE>
<TE>   He shrugs off the cold. No time for that now. The coastal clouds
have lifted. The afternoon light is at his back. The mission is a go.
He fires off frame after frame, steadying the camera to compensate
for the vibration.</TE>
<TE>   Digital images pulse though a wire into his laptop computer, which
stores each one.</TE>
<TE>   Within a few days, they will be posted on the Web site, which
includes a map finder and longitude and latitude for each photo.</TE>
<TE>   Although the site is only two weeks old, it has logged more than
160,000 visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Adelman is surprised and amused by the response, which has
required him twice to upgrade his computer capacity to handle so many
viewers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just getting started, and here are 160,000 people who have
seen the coast in a way they never have before."</TE>

<HD>Skinhead 'Groupie' Guilty of Murder for Role in Girl's
Slaying</HD>
<DH>Ventura woman's statements led police to gang members who
allegedly killed teenager as she stood guard. She faces life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 30-year-old Ventura woman whose statements to police cracked open
an unsolved 1998 homicide was found guilty of first-degree murder
Tuesday after jurors concluded that she participated in the crime she
helped solve.</LD>
<LD>   Bridget Callahan, who faces a mandatory sentence of life in
prison, wept silently as the verdict was announced in Ventura County
Superior Court after two days of jury deliberations.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling capped a five-day trial in which Callahan's lawyer
portrayed her as a naive girl who was only a witness to the brutal
slaying of Ventura teenager Nichole Hendrix by two skinhead gang
members.</LD>
<TE>   But it was the prosecution portrayal of Callahan as a racist gang
groupie who stood guard as skinheads David Ziesmer and Michael
Bridgeford stabbed Hendrix to death that the jury apparently found
believable.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very pleased with the verdict," said Deputy Atty. Gen.
Michael Katz, whose office took over the case last year amid
allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "The jurors did exactly what they were supposed to do," Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Bamieh, the former prosecutor on the
case, expressed disappointment at the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh said Callahan should have been given some consideration for
her cooperation in the case and should have faced no more than a
second-degree murder sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "She was the reason we were able to solve this case," Bamieh said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Joseph O'Neill met with jurors after the verdicts
were returned and could not be reached for comment. But a motion for
a new trial or reduction of sentence is likely to be filed.</TE>
<TE>   Among the evidence presented at Callahan's trial was her own
statement to police that she stood guard over Hendrix at the City
Center Motel in Ventura on Oct. 15, 1998, as Ziesmer and Bridgeford
searched for weapons to kill the girl.</TE>
<TE>   The pair mistakenly suspected Hendrix of reporting them to police
after they had kidnapped and drugged her to get at stolen property in
her possession, according to testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Hendrix was forced to undress, then stabbed and beaten to death in
the motel bathtub, according to testimony. Her body, found months
later, was packed in cement and dumped in the Ventura County back
country.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors offered to let Callahan plead guilty to second-degree
murder based on her cooperation, but she refused.</TE>
<TE>   That plea would have allowed a chance for parole after 15 years.</TE>

<HD>Guilty Verdict in Gang Slaying</HD>
<DH>Ventura woman's statements led police to skinheads who
allegedly killed her friend as she stood guard. She faces life
without parole.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 30-year-old Ventura woman whose statements to police cracked open
an unsolved 1998 homicide was found guilty of first-degree murder
Tuesday after jurors concluded that she participated in the crime she
helped solve.</LD>
<LD>   Bridget Callahan, who faces a mandatory sentence of life in
prison, wept silently as the verdict was announced in Ventura County
Superior Court after two days of jury deliberations.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling capped a five-day trial in which Callahan's lawyer
portrayed her as a naive girl who was only a witness to the brutal
slaying of Ventura teenager Nichole Hendrix by two skinhead gang
members.</LD>
<TE>   But it was the prosecution portrayal of Callahan as a racist gang
groupie who stood guard as skinheads David Ziesmer and Michael
Bridgeford stabbed Hendrix to death that the jury apparently found
believable.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very pleased with the verdict," said Deputy Atty. Gen.
Michael Katz, whose office took over the case last year amid
allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "The jurors did exactly what they were supposed to do," Katz said.
"The evidence was all there."</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Bamieh, the former prosecutor on the
case, expressed disappointment at the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh said Callahan should have been given some consideration for
her cooperation in the case and should face no more than a
second-degree murder sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "She was the reason we were able to solve this case," Bamieh said.
"Justice justifies a second [degree]."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Joseph O'Neill met with jurors for more than an
hour after the verdicts were returned and could not be reached for
comment. However, a motion for a new trial or reduction of sentence
is likely to be filed.</TE>
<TE>   Among the evidence presented at Callahan's trial was her own
statement to police that she stood guard over Hendrix in a bathroom
at the City Center Motel in Ventura on Oct. 15, 1998, as Ziesmer and
Bridgeford searched for weapons to kill the girl.</TE>
<TE>   The pair mistakenly suspected Hendrix of reporting them to police
after the trio drugged her and sold stolen property in her
possession, according to court testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Hendrix was forced to undress, then stabbed and beaten to death in
the motel bathtub, according to trial testimony. Her body, found
months later, was packed in cement and dumped in the Ventura County
back country.</TE>
<TE>   The defense argued that Callahan acted under duress and feared
being killed by Ziesmer and Bridgeford.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill also argued that his client was deceived by investigators,
who treated her as a witness after she came forward but eventually
charged her with aiding and abetting.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer sought to have the charges against her dismissed,
arguing that authorities led her to believe she would not be
prosecuted if she provided details of the slaying. But the request
was denied.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors offered to let Callahan plead guilty to second-degree
murder based on her cooperation, but she refused.</TE>
<TE>   That plea would have allowed a chance for parole after 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   The verdict returned Tuesday mandates a life prison sentence with
no possibility of parole.</TE>
<TE>   Although charges are still pending against Ziesmer and Bridgeford,
Shelly Holland, the victim's mother, said the case against Callahan
was the most difficult emotionally.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan, a former friend of Hendrix, admitted to police that she
hugged the girl in the bathroom and kissed her goodbye moments before
the killing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just glad it's over," Holland said Tuesday as she left the
courtroom.</TE>

<HD>Girl Scouts Adapt to New Era by Stressing Outreach Efforts</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With a freight train blaring in the background, Ontario teenager
Laura Cano recounts how she sacrificed most extracurricular
activities in a mad dash to finish high school early, before her son
was born six weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   The only program the 18-year-old managed to keep squeezing in
after school at Valley View High -- the Girl Scouts -- provided her
valuable information about how she might be able to pay for classes
at a local community college.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the first time I've done something like this," said Cano,
speaking from her home in a working-class neighborhood. "I wanted to
make things for me and my baby and to have new experiences."</LD>
<TE>   This isn't your mother's Girl Scouts, where a premium was placed
on tasks that girls were expected to aspire to: sewing, cooking and
handicrafts. Today, girls like Cano, who has been a member for a
year, participate in programs that teach self-esteem and leadership
skills.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of things in place that aren't cookies and camp,"
said Robin Dennis, acting chief executive officer of the
Montclair-based Girl Scouts Spanish Trails Council, which is named
for Inland Empire trails used by early missionaries and explorers.
"It's exciting when you look at a group of girls and think to
yourself, 'Is one of those girls going to be the first woman
president?' That's what we teach them."</TE>
<TE>   Administrators at the council's outreach program expect to reach
2,200 girls between the ages of 5 and 17 this year at schools in
Pomona, Baldwin Park, La Puente, Ontario and Montclair. These schools
don't have volunteer leaders; Girl Scout staff members recruit and
lead the troops. A large proportion of youngsters who participate in
the program are lower-income Mexican American girls, Dennis said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of these kids never thought about Girl Scouts. They say Girl
Scouting in Mexico is for rich kids and that they didn't think they
would belong," said Gloria Miller, membership manager of the Spanish
Trails' 11-year-old outreach program. "But our program helped them
make friends. It helped them go places they wouldn't get to go."</TE>
<TE>   The council's outreach program, which costs $284,000 annually,
received $10,000 from last year's Times Holiday Campaign, which is
part of the Los Angeles Times Family Fund. Without that donation,
Dennis said, the council wouldn't have been able to serve some
schools that requested the program.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Times Family Fund is a fund of the McCormick
Tribune Foundation, which will match the first $700,000 raised at 50
cents on the dollar in this year's campaign. The foundation and The
Times absorb all administrative costs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HOW TO GIVE</TE>
<TE>   Donations (checks or money orders) supporting the Holiday Campaign

<HD>Moscow Victim Is Buried in L.A.</HD>
<DH>Grief mixes with anger as relatives condemn Russia's
handling of the theater siege.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mitchell Landsberg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sitting in her West Los Angeles apartment, Lyubov Burban fingered the
document issued last week by a Moscow coroner. With numbing
vagueness, it chronicled the death of her only son: "Cause of death:
Investigation in progress.... Victim of terrorist crimes."</LD>
<LD>   "It was not terrorism," she said, anger piercing her grief. Her
husband, Mark, finished the thought: Their son, he said, "was killed
by the Russian state."</LD>
<LD>   Grigory Burban, 39, was buried Tuesday in a simple, wrenching
ceremony in Hollywood, 6,000 miles from the Moscow theater where he
and more than 100 other hostages died last month. Burban, a Ukrainian
citizen who was a permanent resident of the United States, was among
two people from this country known to have died in the hostage
takeover.</LD>
<TE>   For those who knew and loved him, it was an inconceivable end -- a
thunderbolt, a random injustice -- to a man known as a kind-hearted
bridge between two worlds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's mind-boggling to think about it," said a friend, Alexander
Livitz, a software engineer who went to college with Burban in the
Ukrainian city of Odessa and came to his funeral from Walnut Creek in
the Bay Area. "He didn't even have any relations or friends in
Moscow. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time."</TE>
<TE>   Burban's death, and the way it was handled by the Russian
government, struck his family -- which came to the United States from
Odessa less than a decade ago -- as a chilling throwback to the
system under which they had lived for years.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had any illusions whatsoever -- and I did -- that things had
changed there, this time all my illusions disappeared," said Ilya
Teplitsky, a cousin. "It's like going back to the worst Soviet times,
you know?"</TE>
<TE>   Rebels from the breakaway republic of Chechnya seized the Moscow
theater and about 750 hostages Oct. 23, threatening to blow up the
building if Russia did not comply with a demand to begin a military
pullout from Chechnya. Rather than give in, Russian special forces
pumped a knockout gas into the theater two days later, instantly
incapacitating the 60 hostage-takers -- as well as the hostages.</TE>
<TE>   Russian authorities, led by President Vladimir V. Putin, hailed
the outcome as a success, even after nearly 120 people died from the
effects of the gas. Without resolute action, they said, all of the
hostages might have died. Critics of the operation accused the
Russian authorities of bungling the emergency preparations to deal
with the effects of the gas, and refusing to tell doctors what type
of gas had been used.</TE>
<TE>   Burban was an electronics salesman who traveled frequently between
Los Angeles and Odessa. Recently divorced and remarried, he had gone
to Moscow with his new wife, Yelena, on a trip combining business and
pleasure. Between business appointments, family members said, the
couple had decided to go to the theater.</TE>
<TE>   Burban had a habit of calling his parents every evening at 9. The
parents, Lyubov and Mark Burban, had been scientists in the Soviet
Union -- she an award-winning chemist, he an electronics engineer at
a military research institute -- who immigrated to the United States
in 1994, three years after the Soviet collapse, and became
naturalized citizens. As Jews who grew up under Joseph Stalin, the
Burbans loathed the Soviet Union and remained deeply suspicious of
the regimes that replaced it.</TE>
<TE>   On the first night of the hostage siege, Grigory called his
parents as usual from his cellular telephone, mentioning that he was
in Moscow but saying nothing about being held captive.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to protect them," said his aunt, Svetlana Teplitsky.</TE>
<TE>   But the next day, Grigory didn't call, and his parents began to
worry. Eventually, they called their son's business partner in
Odessa. Grigory was in the theater, they were told.</TE>
<TE>   The Burbans booked the next Aeroflot flight from Los Angeles to
Moscow. By the time they left L.A., the theater had been gassed and
stormed, and Russian officials were confidently saying that all but a
few hostages survived.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the Burbans arrived in Moscow, the full measure of the
tragedy was unfolding. From the moment they landed, they began
pleading for information and encountering stony silence. On their
second day, the Burbans finally found their son -- in a morgue.</TE>
<TE>   For the better part of a Kafkaesque week after that, they
struggled with the Russian bureaucracy for a death certificate and
other documentation that would allow them to bring their son's body
to Los Angeles. They finally succeeded with the help of the U.S.
Embassy.</TE>
<TE>   "As an American citizen," Mark Burban said, choking up, "I really
felt this country helped me."</TE>
<TE>   They are bitter about the way the Russian government handled the
siege, believing it reverted to Soviet habits of putting "state
security first, human security second," Mark Burban said.</TE>
<TE>   During the funeral Tuesday at Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Grigory
Burban was remembered as a man of uncommon generosity who would make
each trip between Odessa and Los Angeles carrying a suitcase jammed
with gifts and letters, serving as a conduit between Old World and
New. He helped support relatives in Ukraine, and helped others settle
in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose of his life was kindness for people," said Rabbi
Velvel Tsikman, also an emigre from Odessa, who officiated at the
funeral.</TE>
<TE>   The service featured two moments of particular poignancy. Burban's
son, 12-year-old David, rose before the large audience, including
many of his father's childhood friends, and delivered a two-sentence
eulogy.</TE>
<TE>   He and his father always spent vacations together, he said. He
paused, struggling to maintain his composure.</TE>
<TE>   "Those were really great times," he choked out. Other sobs could
be heard as he returned to his seat.</TE>
<TE>   Lyubov Burban also spoke. "Part of his business was helping
people," she said in Russian. "Now we need help. We need help to
punish the people who didn't care about other people's lives. We have
to find a way to show the world it was a crime against humanity, to
show everybody it was a crime against the average people, and they
just didn't care about them."</TE>

<HD>Failure of Secession: Why a City Divided Still Stands as
One</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not so many months ago, the city that reinvented the American city
seemed destined to take corrective action, rebelling against its own
immensity.</LD>
<LD>   Wilmington had its bags packed.</LD>
<LD>   San Pedro had the car running.</LD>
<TE>   Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley felt so jilted, they had
divorce papers drawn up.</TE>
<TE>   And yet today Los Angeles wakes up whole, its borders untouched,
its unhappy children still living at home.</TE>
<TE>   So why did the idea of secession never catch fire?</TE>
<TE>   Theories will be tossed around for years.</TE>
<TE>   1. Secession leaders were rank amateurs who never made a
compelling case for a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   2. They were so wildly outspent by the other side -- roughly 5 to
1 -- they didn't stand a chance.</TE>
<TE>   3. The problems people care about most -- crime, traffic, schools,
health care -- can't be fixed by forming new cities.</TE>
<TE>   4. Angelenos are too disengaged to have cared one way or another.</TE>
<TE>   There's truth in each of those. But there's a more compelling
reason the city is intact today.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles, despite considerable flaws, is reasonably content
with itself.</TE>
<TE>   "This is God's country," Herm Siegle, 87, proclaimed on the way
out of his polling place on Huston Street in Sherman Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "I voted 'no' on secession," the retired clothier said proudly,
pointing out the lovely tree-shaded vista.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got problems, and I hate the traffic, but every city has
problems."</TE>
<TE>   Valley secession leaders miscalculated in more ways than one.</TE>
<TE>   First, they pitched a new bureaucracy -- the Valley city of 1.5
million would have been the sixth largest in the nation -- as a cure
for whatever ails people in the very region where the nation's
anti-government tax revolt began.</TE>
<TE>   Second, they failed to understand that residents of Los Angeles
don't identify with a city framed by lines on a map, nor do they get
worked up about civics unless something really goes haywire.</TE>
<TE>   They live in their backyards and in the small orbit of their own
neighborhoods, which too often have fences between them. But they
also live in and relate to the idea of Los Angeles -- a vast,
borderless universe identified by climate, mountains, beaches,
autonomy, invention, Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who thinks it's a bad deal already moved to Phoenix or
somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. is both bigger than the city of Los Angeles and smaller than
it," says Joel Kotkin, a political commentator who took his daughter
trick-or-treating on Halloween and saw hundreds of families of all
backgrounds on the streets of Valley Village.</TE>
<TE>   "The city works on that neighborhood level and on the mega-level.
But it's the middle part we can't get right," says Kotkin, who blames
both sides of the secession debate for failing to break through the
wall and get people talking about ways to make L.A. work better.
"Political boundaries and abstractions don't engage people."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Flaherty, a retired school principal, was engaged. But he
wasn't convinced there was any reason to secede, he said after
casting a 'no' vote on Chandler Boulevard near Laurel Canyon
Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "I think L.A. is doing a reasonably sound job of serving the
Valley, and I feel like I can influence a change if I need to,"
Flaherty said.</TE>
<TE>   Michele Leff, an artist and student, followed Flaherty out of the
polling booth and said she listened to the anti-secessionists during
the campaign, but didn't hear a clear plan for a better city.</TE>
<TE>   "As an artist," she said, "I see a lot of cultural advantages to
being a part of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   The election day sun shone brightly through the haze, casting a
warm glow on this love affair. I drove out of the Valley, over the
pass, and into the bedroom of the other allegedly unhappy child --
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Ira Dankberg, an architect, had just left his polling place at
Wilcox and Fountain, having cast one more vote for Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I see L.A. as unique," Dankberg said. "I see the whole city as an
exciting mosaic, an exciting vegetable soup. I like having so many
flavors, textures and cultures, some new and some old. I like how it
all blends together. My family is in Phoenix and when I visit I find
it too clean, too white, and too simple for me, and I always want to
come back home."</TE>
<TE>   And so the city wakes up whole, its borders untouched, its unhappy
children still living at home.</TE>

<HD>Muslim Teenagers Form Link From Koran to U.S. Mainstream</HD>
<DH>The growing number of youths reciting Ramadan prayers
signals the emergence of a generation of U.S.-born leadership.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Lobdell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Each evening for a month, a handful of teenage boys across Southern
California will recite from memory a chapter of the Koran -- Islam's
holy book -- to crowds gathered at mosques. Just one of these evening
prayers can take up to 90 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   By the end of the 30 days of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month that
began at sundown Tuesday, the boys will have chanted in ancient
Arabic all 6,391 verses of the Koran.</LD>
<LD>   This doesn't just mark an impressive feat of mental agility, local
Muslim leaders say. It also signals the emergence of the next
generation of Islamic leadership in America: native-born Muslims who
are devout enough to spend years committing the Koran to memory but
who are also able to blend in easily with the local culture.</LD>
<TE>   Outside the Islamic Society of Orange County mosque in Garden
Grove last week, Nasir Jiwa, 17, looked like any other U.S. teenager.
Dressed in jeans and a long-sleeve shirt, he rode a scooter and joked
with friends.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, Nasir will be leading prayers at the Islamic Society of
Fountain Valley mosque.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the next generation," said Nasir, a student at Orange
Coast College who said he started to memorize the Koran five years
ago. "I feel like this is my country and this is my religion. Of
course, I feel a sense of responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Ramadan marks the revelation of the Koran to the prophet Muhammad.
During the monthlong observance, Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset,
say additional daily prayers, give to charity and, on the last and
holiest day, celebrate Eid al-Fitr, or Feast of the Fast-Breaking.</TE>
<TE>   There are no statistics on how many Muslim teenagers in the United
States have memorized the Koran in recent years, an achievement
Islamic experts say is accomplished by only about 1% of the followers
of Islam. But local officials estimate about two dozen Southern
California teenagers can recite the holy book by heart, making them
eligible to say the extended prayers of Ramadan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very heartwarming to see Muslims born and raised in America
become part of the leadership and taking us into new directions,"
said Sabiha Kahn, a spokeswoman for the Southern California chapter
of the Council for American-Islamic Relations.</TE>
<TE>   For Muneeb Baig, 16, this will be his fourth year of leading
prayers at the Garden Grove mosque. He finished memorizing the Koran
at age 13, after three years and four to five hours a day of study.
In preparation for Ramadan, he has reviewed the text for up to 90
minutes each day. This kind of religious devotion led to a decision
by him and his family to attend school at home, freeing up time for
further Islamic studies.</TE>
<TE>   "I memorized the Koran, but I haven't become a scholar of the
religion yet," said the soft-spoken Muneeb.</TE>
<TE>   Faiz Dadabhoy, 17, of Diamond Bar said he was moved to memorize
the Koran after hearing a younger Muslim lead Ramadan prayers three
years ago and envisioning himself in that role.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty motivated by it," said Faiz, who will recite the
Koran during Ramadan at the Islamic Center of San Gabriel Valley in
Walnut. "It's good to have people born in the community [lead
prayers]. They know English better, and they know the culture
better."</TE>
<TE>   All the teenagers are quick to underscore their respect of the
elder leaders of the mosques. Most are immigrants who memorized the
Koran in their homelands. But they agree that their generation's
advantage is that it can better integrate a U.S. minority religion
into the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   The young leaders also can relate to the special problems young
Muslims face in this society -- including prejudice, fashion
challenges and dating.</TE>
<TE>   "Young kids have people to identify with," Kahn said. "They are
people who went through the same things as us and rose above it all"
to remain true to their Islamic values.</TE>

<TE>   Ramadan</TE>
<TE>   Ramadan is the Muslim holy month that celebrates the revelation of
the Koran, Islam's holy book, to the prophet Muhammad. The month is
devoted to sacrifice, community, introspection and charity. The
Ramadan fast -- sawm -- during which adults abstain from eating and
drinking during the day, is one of the five pillars, or basic duties,
of Islam. The other pillars are the shahada, or profession of faith;
the salat, or formal prayer; the zakat, a tithing for charity; and
the hajj, a pilgrimage to Mecca.</TE>

<HD>Flaws Found in Bridge Linking O.C. Freeways</HD>
<DH>Broken-off concrete may delay completion of the $12-million
carpool ramp between 405 and 55. It's not in danger of collapsing,
officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Construction defects may delay the opening -- and possibly require
the rebuilding -- of a $12-million carpool lane connector at the busy
interchange of the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County transportation officials said Tuesday that they are
investigating structural defects recently discovered in portions of
the two-way, half-mile ramp between the freeways.</LD>
<LD>   Although experts said the bridge is in no danger of collapsing,
patches of broken-off concrete raise questions about the connector's
ability to carry heavy traffic.</LD>
<TE>   Repair work could involve as little as redoing sections of
concrete or, in the worst case, rebuilding the 60-foot-high flyover
at a cost of millions of dollars and a delay of eight months.</TE>
<TE>   The ramp near John Wayne Airport was scheduled to open in April.
But officials said the defects could postpone that until the end of
next year, at the latest.</TE>
<TE>   "We are now assessing what the problems are and how to fix them,"
said Rick Grebner, an engineer and project manager for the Orange
County Transportation Authority. "If left as it is, it won't carry
the traffic it was designed for. There is a problem of long-term
durability."</TE>
<TE>   The carpool connector between the 405 and 55 is part of a
$125-million project to relieve congestion on one of the nation's
busiest highway interchanges. Drivers make about 433,000 trips a day
through the area.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA is funding the project through Measure M, the local sales tax
used for transportation projects.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans is overseeing construction of an array of connectors and
offramps, including ones at Bristol Street and Avenue of the Arts in
Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   The entire project, which is being built by C.C. Myers Inc. of
Rancho Cordova, Calif., is scheduled to be finished in 2004, about
five years after construction began.</TE>
<TE>   Pam Gorniak, a spokeswoman for the California Department of
Transportation, said Tuesday that it was premature for the agency to
issue any statements about the cause of the problems or who was
responsible. A complete assessment is due in about two months.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is speculation at this point," Gorniak said. "We need
more data on this. There is nothing conclusive yet."</TE>
<TE>   Work was halted on the connector about two months ago when
construction crews found that surface layers of concrete were falling
off supporting walls under the roadway.</TE>
<TE>   The unusual condition is known as spawling.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the investigation has found that spawling has affected
about 5% of the concrete that covers the bridge's reinforcing steel
along the walls of the road's inside curve.</TE>
<TE>   Although the assessment is not finished, Grebner said the concrete
might have fallen off when construction crews, using hydraulic
machinery, applied tension to reinforcing cables that run through the
ramp.</TE>
<TE>   The tension, designed to strengthen the structure, could have
caused the cables to move unexpectedly, popping off the concrete.</TE>
<TE>   "The bridge is not moving or creeping," Grebner said. "No new
damage has been found, but the study is still underway."</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials said the bridge is seismically safe, but traffic
will not be allowed on it until the structure is declared sound.</TE>
<TE>   The problems, they added, will not affect other parts of the
interchange project.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Santa Paula boy accused of fatally beating a neighborhood couple
with a bat during a home burglary last month appeared in Ventura
County Superior Court on Tuesday but did not enter a plea.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Jay Johnson told Judge Kevin McGee that he needed
additional time to review charges of murder, robbery, burglary and
joyriding against Adam Sarabia, 16. McGee ordered Sarabia back to
court Nov. 13 for arraignment.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson later described Sarabia as a good student who had only one
previous run-in with police for inhaling chemicals.</LD>
<TE>   Sarabia was arrested Friday on suspicion of bludgeoning John
Ramirez Jr., 59, and Joann Wotkyns, 55, in the bedroom of their Santa
Paula home Oct. 21.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. John C. West said Tuesday that the motive
appears to be burglary.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>During a conversation with his then-fiancee, Michael Schultz, 33,
admitted raping and killing a woman in 1993 and begged his future
wife to keep silent about the crime, she testified Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Therresa Mooney told a judge that months after the 1999
conversation, she called police using a fake name and said that DNA
tests would link Schultz to the slaying of Cynthia Burger, 44, of
Port Hueneme. Mooney also tearfully testified that she feared
Schultz.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities say her tip cracked open a six-year investigation.
Mooney was among the first witnesses to testify at Schultz's
preliminary hearing, which continues today in Ventura County Superior
Court.</LD>
<TE>   Schultz is charged with one count of murder committed during a
rape, and burglary. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.</TE>

<HD>Shipping Cranes Cleared to Land at Port</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A legal dispute over the definition of the words "erect position" was
at the heart of an unsuccessful effort Tuesday to prevent four giant
cranes from being delivered to a new Port of Los Angeles terminal --
a move praised by industry but opposed by environmentalists.</LD>
<LD>   Hoping to take advantage of an extremely low tide that will enable
the 16-story cranes to fit under the Vincent Thomas Bridge, port
officials plan to move the cranes today, upright on a vessel, to the
still-unfinished China Shipping terminal.</LD>
<LD>   A coalition of community activists and environmentalists has
complained that the first environmental review of the terminal
project was inadequate, and last week persuaded a three-judge panel
to halt terminal construction, pending further review of how the
project would affect the nearby community.</LD>
<TE>   The coalition argued that the order by the 2nd District Court of
Appeal staying completion of the terminal barred "erection and
operation" of the cranes.</TE>
<TE>   In an emergency motion filed with the court Tuesday morning,
attorneys for the Natural Resources Defense Council argued that if
the cranes were to be delivered, they would have to be laid on their
sides or stored at an alternative site.</TE>
<TE>   But the court sided with port authorities, who said the cranes
were already assembled when they were shipped from Shanghai and could
not be offloaded or stored in a horizontal position without risk of
damage.</TE>
<TE>   In essence, the port argued that it did not erect the cranes --
they arrived vertical -- and thus they can be unloaded.</TE>
<TE>   "We are disappointed with the court's decision," said coalition
attorney Julie Masters. "But those cranes still cannot operate
pending completion of the environmental review."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the port's director, Mayor James K. Hahn urged the
port to store the cranes away from the disputed terminal.</TE>
<TE>   The cranes, bought by China Shipping for about $7 million each,
are to be placed on specially designed rails and outfitted with
aircraft warning lights.</TE>

<HD>Probe of EIDC Moves East</HD>
<DH>D.A.'s investigators, FBI search the Pittsburgh Film Office
in connection with questionable agency donations.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County district attorney's probe into alleged misuse
of public funds by the Entertainment Industry Development Corp. and
its president spread to Pennsylvania Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Five Los Angeles investigators from the district attorney's office
searched the Pittsburgh Film Office and the home of its commissioner,
Dawn Keezer, a friend of EIDC President Cody Cluff. Investigators
also searched the Mendelson Gallery in Pittsburgh.</LD>
<LD>   The searches are in connection with $5,000 donations from the
EIDC, which coordinates the issuing of film permits in Los Angeles
County, to the Pittsburgh Film Office in each of the last two years,
according to David Demerjian, head of the district attorney's public
integrity division. Two other sources told The Times the search of
the Mendelson Gallery was in connection with a painting Cluff
purchased there and shipped back to Los Angeles, where he hung it in
the EIDC's Hollywood office.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators from the Allegheny County district attorney's office
and the FBI joined Los Angeles officials in the searches.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff, whose agency is also responsible for promoting Los Angeles
as a film production site, would not comment Tuesday. In the past, he
has defended giving $10,000 to Keezer's office, saying it was
beneficial to the L.A. film industry. He said he believed it was
important to support Keezer because, as president of a national
organization of film commissioners called FilmUS, she "has led the
charge" to keep filmmaking in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   He also has said the EIDC has given money to other state and
national organizations, including money to support events of the San
Jose Film Commission and the Assn. of International Commercial
Producers.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have alleged in court papers that the misuse of funds
by Cluff and the EIDC includes money spent for personal expense
accounts and political contributions made by the agency to elected
officials who serve on the corporation's board of directors and
executive committee.</TE>
<TE>   The raids were the third round of multiple searches by the
district attorney's office in its investigation of Cluff and the
EIDC.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's searches began when investigators approached Keezer as
she got off a plane at Pittsburgh International Airport after a trip
to Los Angeles, said her attorney, Stanton Levenson. He said they
seized her laptop computer and personal papers.</TE>
<TE>   Another source said investigators also searched her luggage.</TE>
<TE>   Levenson said Keezer would not comment on the search. "She was
pretty shaken by this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Levenson said he did not know what authorities seized from her
office and home, but one source said payroll records of FilmUS and a
list of its staff members were among the items they wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff, who is acting secretary of FilmUS, said he made the
donation after learning the group might lose its funding. It was "in
recognition of the leadership role Keezer played in the federal tax
relief effort and the critical need for an articulate, dedicated
spokesperson who is not from Los Angeles."</TE>

<HD>Bratton to Review Police Merger Plan</HD>
<DH>Former Chief Parks proposed four years ago that the LAPD
and LAX forces be combined. The idea was rejected by the City
Council.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Oldham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A proposal to merge the police force that patrols Los Angeles
International Airport with the LAPD gained momentum Tuesday when Los
Angeles Police Chief William Bratton agreed to review a 4-year-old
plan to consolidate the two departments.</LD>
<LD>   Bratton will discuss the issue with the city Police Commission
after a 30-day review. The move is the latest in a series of debates
over the last decade about the idea, revived by former Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks in his 1998 "One City -- One Police Department"
proposal.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council ultimately rejected Parks' plan, which suggests
that the Los Angeles Police Department take over the policing
functions performed by eight independent city authorities including
the Harbor Department Port Police, the Park Rangers of the Department
of Recreation and Parks, and the Department of Water and Power
Security Services Business Group.</LD>
<TE>   The city's new police chief has faced questions regarding the role
of specialized forces before. During his tenure as New York City's
police commissioner, Bratton took control of forces operated by the
city's housing and transit departments. Officers working for the Port
Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey, who patrol the city's airports,
remained independent.</TE>
<TE>   In L.A., the issue reemerged after a grisly Fourth of July
shooting at LAX when several public safety officials argued that
merging the LAPD and the airport police would eliminate communication
snafus and costly duplication of resources.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't have a coordinated effort when you have two levels of
command," Police Commission President Rick Caruso said Tuesday. "One
of the city's most important assets is LAX, and LAPD officers are
better trained and equipped to deal with issues at the airport."</TE>
<TE>   With the backing of Mayor James K. Hahn and the council's Public
Safety Committee, interim Chief Martin Pomeroy recommended in an Oct.
15 memo that the commission reconsider Parks' proposal. Councilman
Jack Weiss, who sits on the public safety panel, reiterated his
support for a review on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter whether the LAPD or the airport police write
more parking tickets," he said. "The real test is if and when a real
attack occurs at LAX. If there's one thing we've learned about Al
Qaeda, it is that they do not take targets off their target list.
.... LAX has been a target."</TE>
<TE>   The review could prompt a showdown between the Police Commission
and Airport Commission, which unanimously approved a strongly worded
resolution last summer that allows the airport agency to retain
control of an autonomous police force as provided by the City
Charter. Merging the airport police and the LAPD would require a
charter amendment and voter approval.</TE>
<TE>   "This issue has been studied numerous times, including studying
Chief Parks' proposal, and the conclusion was that the safety of our
passengers at LAX is better served by having the airport police,"
Airport Commission President Ted Stein said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, airport police officers receive special training, he
said. This includes 22 weeks at the Police Academy and an additional
23 weeks to learn Federal Aviation Administration regulations,
according to a white paper drafted by the city agency that operates
LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Airport police work to prevent crime at LAX; the LAPD responds
primarily when a crime occurs. Airport police have about 240 sworn
officers and 200 unarmed security officers at LAX. The LAPD has 74
officers stationed there, and 60 off-duty officers who are paid
overtime by the city's airport agency to patrol airport grounds until
they're relieved by additional airport police officers early next
year.</TE>

<HD>Rubin Is Said to Improve</HD>
<DH>The militant Jewish Defense League leader's wife says he
has shown signs of brain activity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Rosenzweig and Greg Krikorian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With his family claiming he was improving, Irv Rubin remained in
grave condition Tuesday as new details emerged about what authorities
called his suicide attempt in federal prison.</LD>
<LD>   The firebrand national director of the Jewish Defense League
suffered serious head injuries Monday when, according to officials,
he slashed himself with a razor, then leaped over a railing at the
Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Rubin's 18-foot fall occurred only hours before he and his chief
lieutenant were to appear in U.S. District Court for a hearing on
charges that he had plotted to bomb a mosque and a congressman's
office.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Shelley Rubin said her 57-year-old husband had showed
signs of brain activity.</TE>
<TE>   "Irv is not brain-dead," she said in a statement released by the
JDL. "His heart is fine. He is breathing on his own, although he is
still connected to a respirator. But the doctors said he was
'breathing over' the respirator."</TE>
<TE>   As authorities wrapped up the initial, on-site phase of their
investigation, an FBI spokesman said there was no indication that
Rubin's injuries were anything but self-inflicted.</TE>
<TE>   "All the evidence indicates this was an attempted suicide," said
Agent Matthew McLaughlin.</TE>
<TE>   That conclusion was reached after agents interviewed more than 15
witnesses to Rubin's fall, including corrections officers and
inmates, McLaughlin said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he said, FBI agents have determined that no one was
within 15 feet of Rubin when he began cutting at his throat with a
razor blade and then plunged over a prison railing.</TE>
<TE>   Although authorities recovered the blade, taken from a
prison-issued disposable razor, no suicide note has been found,
according to officials.</TE>
<TE>   At County-USC Medical Center, trauma physicians were taking a
wait-and-see position before offering a prognosis on Rubin's chances
of recovery, according to his wife.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital declined to provide information on Rubin's condition.</TE>
<TE>   Though he could not address specifics of Rubin's condition, U.S.
marshal spokesman William Woolsey said his staff had allowed the
family more visits to the hospital "to discuss what the options are"
with physicians.</TE>
<TE>   A JDL spokesman said the doctors would not be able to make an
assessment until the swelling in Rubin's brain subsides, which is
expected in two or three days.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Peter Morris, who had put out word Monday that
Rubin was near death, said late Tuesday that he had revised his view
after receiving confirmation from federal officials that Rubin was
not brain-dead.</TE>
<TE>   Those mildly optimistic accounts on Rubin's condition could not be
independently corroborated. But they caused lawyers in the bombing
conspiracy case to consider a number of possible scenarios, depending
on whether Rubin lives.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Werksman, attorney for Earl Krugel, who is the other man
charged in the case, said Monday's incident would make the
prosecution's case much easier.</TE>
<TE>   "In the unlikely event Irv survives and recovers, we may be back
on track," said Werksman, a former federal prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   But if Rubin dies, Werksman said, the U.S. attorney's office will
need to prosecute only one defendant, whose purported role in the
case always has been more pronounced.</TE>
<TE>   "Earl was on 80% of the [government's] tapes. He had a much more
forward role in this so-called conspiracy," Werksman said of his
client.</TE>
<TE>   "From the government's standpoint, it makes the prosecution
immeasurably simpler not to have to deal with Irv and his charges of
being targeted," Werksman said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, he said, he might be forced to negotiate a plea
agreement for his client instead of going to trial if Rubin dies.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Rubin was scheduled to appear in court on what Werksman
said would have been a "watershed" hearing at which the defense was
seeking any evidence of prior FBI investigations of the JDL.</TE>
<TE>   Krugel, the JDL's West Coast coordinator, contends that he was the
victim of illegal entrapment by a former JDL member-turned-FBI
informant.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin's defense team built its case around a claim of government
bias against its client.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin and Krugel face at least 35 years in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Gregory Jessner said Tuesday that he would be
willing to talk to Werksman about a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Jessner said that if Rubin survives his injuries but incurs so
much brain damage that he can't participate in his defense, the case
against him probably will be dropped with the court's consent.</TE>
<TE>   And if he survives but faces a lengthy period of recovery, then
"he would probably get his wish and have trial of his case severed
from Krugel's," Jessner added.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin's lawyers had asked U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew for
a separate trial, contending that the jury would be prejudiced
because of racist comments made by Krugel during secretly recorded
conversations with the FBI informant.</TE>
<TE>   Lew was scheduled to hear arguments on that motion and others
Monday morning.</TE>
<TE>   After Rubin's injuries, the hearing was put off until Dec. 2. The
trial was scheduled to begin Jan. 21.</TE>
<TE>   Before Monday's incident, there had been seven suicides among
inmates at the federal prison, opened in December 1988, according to
Associate Warden Brian Hoyt.</TE>

<HD>No Verdict in Ryder Jury's Day 1</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jurors in the Winona Ryder shoplifting trial deliberated five hours
Tuesday without reaching a verdict.</LD>
<LD>   The jurors, who selected an aerospace engineer as foreman, are
considering whether the Oscar-nominated actress should be convicted
of grand theft, burglary and vandalism, for which she could receive
up to three years in state prison.</LD>
<LD>   The jury, which includes film producer Peter Guber, is due back in
the Beverly Hills courthouse today at 10 a.m. to resume
deliberations. The six-man, six-woman panel sent no messages to the
court during the day and asked no questions.</LD>
<TE>   Ryder is accused of walking out of Saks Fifth Avenue in December
with more than $5,500 worth of unpaid merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Tuesday, the state's 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled
that Superior Court Judge Elden Fox erred in refusing to make public
written questionnaires that the jurors filled out before being
selected.</TE>
<TE>   The court declared 3 to 0 that Fox failed to follow the 1st
Amendment, which it said clearly gives the public the right of access
to the jury selection process. Though some information can be
excluded, such as jurors' names and certain private data, Fox "has
not identified any such interest that justifies a complete denial of
access to the completed questionnaires," the court ruled. The court
ordered Fox to release the questionnaires by Thursday afternoon or
file a motion in opposition by Nov. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The appellate ruling was in response to legal papers filed by The
Times, Associated Press and Los Angeles Daily Journal. The court
ruled last week that Fox erred in denying access to several motions
and transcripts.</TE>

<HD>Businessman Found Not Guilty in Fatal Fall Off Hotel
Balcony</HD>
<DH>Some jurors said the lack of signs of a struggle by Sandra
Orellana influenced the verdict.</DH>

<LD>A Texas businessman was found not guilty Tuesday of charges that he
pushed a colleague to her death from a hotel's eighth-floor balcony.</LD>
<LD>   The prosecution alleged that Robert Lee Salazar, 39, had sexually
attacked Sandra Orellana, 27, at the Industry Hills Sheraton in 1996
and then shoved her from the balcony when she resisted. Salazar
feared losing his wife and new executive job if Orellana revealed the
attack, the prosecution contended.</LD>
<LD>   Salazar was then vice president of Houston-based Skillmaster
Staffing Services, where Orellana was a workers' compensation
specialist.</LD>
<TE>   The defense had argued that the pair, in Los Angeles on business
and both very drunk the night of the death, had a consensual
one-night affair. Orellana fell accidentally, the defense said, as
the two were engaged in foreplay.</TE>
<TE>   The jury of seven men and five women in Pomona Superior Court
found Salazar not guilty of first-degree murder, for which he could
have faced 25 years to life in prison. They also found him not guilty
of second-degree murder, which carried a sentence of 15 years to
life.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't believe for a second that he intentionally threw her
over the balcony," juror Becky Murrieta said. Jurors said they were
bothered by the absence of any signs of a struggle.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar's wife, Beth, cried loudly as the verdicts were read.
Salazar hugged his attorney, Michael R. Coghlan.</TE>
<TE>   "I just thank God," Salazar said outside the courtroom. "God knew
the truth, and he's letting me go home."</TE>
<TE>   His wife said now they "can work on reconciliation of our
marriage, because something did happen. It's love that keeps you
together."</TE>
<TE>   The family of Orellana contended that Salazar had made sexual
advances toward her, and that she had contemplated filing a sexual
harassment charge. They said she was engaged and would not have had
an affair.</TE>
<TE>   Her family left the courthouse somberly, escorted by sheriff's
deputies and without speaking to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obviously disappointing," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert
Foltz.</TE>
<TE>   Foltz said that Salazar lied repeatedly to homicide investigators
the day after the death and to the jury. He said it was physically
impossible for Orellana to fall the way Salazar described it.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is the jury is the system we have to rely on," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Former Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti had decided there was insufficient
evidence to prosecute Salazar. When Steve Cooley assumed that post,
he decided to prosecute.</TE>
<TE>   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office,
said Tuesday that Cooley is not second-guessing that decision.</TE>
<TE>   "When Steve came into office, he said he was going to take a fresh
eyes approach on a number of cases, including this one and the 'Angel
of Death' prosecution," she said, referring to the case of Efren
Saldivar.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar, a respiratory therapist, was convicted of murder for
killing six patients at Glendale Adventist Medical Center by
injecting them with a paralyzing drug.</TE>
<TE>   During the Salazar trial, the prosecution and defense didn't
differ much on the chronology of events. In November 1996, Salazar
had recently become vice president of Skillmaster. He and Orellana
came to Los Angeles to become acquainted with a subsidiary that
Skillmaster had bought here.</TE>
<TE>   After a day of business, Salazar, Orellana and a representative of
the subsidiary had dinner. Salazar and Orellana began a night of
drinking.</TE>
<TE>   Orellana was scheduled to fly to Hong Kong the next day to join
her fiance. But, Salazar testified, at the hotel bar he and Orellana
began dancing, hugging and kissing.</TE>
<TE>   He contended that at about midnight, the two went to the eighth
floor, where Orellana invited him into her room.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar testified that at one point, Orellana said that she was
hot and, wearing only a top, stepped onto the balcony, and that he
followed. He said that Orellana, facing the balcony, turned to face
him, lifted one leg, tried to hop up to sit on the railing and fell
over.</TE>
<TE>   Foltz argued that Salazar used his status and power over Orellana
to get her drunk. Salazar knew, Foltz argued, that Orellana was so
drunk that she was in and out of consciousness and could not resist
him.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor argued that Orellana woke up during the attack and
Salazar, who had written his company's sexual harassment policy,
realized he would lose his job and family.</TE>
<TE>   Orellana's sister, Katherine Orellana, 29, said her sibling was a
bright young woman who spoke four languages and had started college
just as she turned 17.</TE>
<TE>   Sandra Orellana wanted to transfer to California, Katherine
Orellana said, so she could more easily fly out to see her fiance in
Hong Kong.</TE>
<TE>   "She was really ambitious about her career," said Katherine
Orellana. "She also wanted to settle down. I think when she found
someone, she started envisioning that."</TE>

<HD>District Probes Hiring of Teacher</HD>
<DH>Man accused of killing his girlfriend was convicted of
domestic abuse in 1990.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Wride</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Woodrow Wilson High School teacher who was charged Tuesday with the
first-degree murder of his girlfriend, a Wilson graduate, was
convicted of misdemeanor spousal abuse seven years before the Long
Beach Unified School District hired him.</LD>
<LD>   The district is investigating how it hired Pedro Tepoz-Leon, 34,
who pleaded guilty to spousal violence and battery Aug. 9, 1990, and
served three years' informal probation, said spokesman Dick Van Der
Laan. The U.S. Department of Justice conducts fingerprinting and
background checks on all teaching applicants and any serious or
violent felony conviction would mean automatic rejection.</LD>
<LD>   Misdemeanors, Van Der Laan said, are usually a judgment call that
first would be made by the California Commission on Teacher
Credentialing before the district considered a teacher's application.
The commission would consider whether an applicant's crimes,
particularly misdemeanors, would endanger students or teachers or
preclude someone from teaching, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Tepoz-Leon has a teaching credential that expires in 2006,
according to the commission's Web site. No one there or at the
Justice Department could be reached late Tuesday for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a great desire here to find out how something like this
could happen," Van Der Laan said. "As far as the specifics of this
case, we don't know yet. I know no one is taking this more seriously
than the superintendent."</TE>
<TE>   Christopher J. Steinhauser, who last month became superintendent
of the Long Beach district, the state's third-largest, was not
available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Tepoz-Leon, 34, pleaded not guilty to one count of murder Tuesday
during an appearance before a Long Beach Superior Court judge, who
set bail at $1 million and ordered a pretrial hearing for Dec. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Tepoz-Leon, his neck bandaged for wounds that police suspect were
self-inflicted after the attack on his girlfriend, said little but
"yes" to the judge and waived his right to hearings that would
otherwise occur earlier.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney declined to comment after the arraignment.</TE>
<TE>   The body of Mayra Mora Lopez, 19, was found beaten and stabbed in
the couple's Long Beach apartment Oct. 27. Long Beach police officers
were called to the area on a report that a man was stabbed. Officers
arrived and found no such man, but someone said they should check the
couple's apartment.</TE>
<TE>   An hour later near Vacaville, Calif., Tepoz-Leon pulled up in his
vehicle behind an officer and, bleeding from wounds on his neck and
torso, requested help.</TE>

<HD>County Teenagers Pitch In at the Polls</HD>
<DH>About 100 high school seniors work as election clerks as
part of a program to inspire and teach them about the voting process.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>Whitney Kellerhouse smiled cheerfully, reshuffled a pile of papers
and scanned the silent room for someone, anyone, in need of
assistance.</LD>
<LD>   No luck.</LD>
<LD>   Scattered around the cafeteria of Ventura's Will Rogers Elementary
School, voters quietly punched their ballots and went on their way.</LD>
<TE>   "I took a training class last week," said Whitney, 17. "But I hope
we don't have to deal with hanging chads."</TE>
<TE>   Whitney and 17-year-old Erica Bjorndahl, both seniors at Ventura
High School, spent the day as election clerks as part of a countywide
effort to involve high school students in the voting process. They
were paid a small stipend and were assigned to help voters decipher
ballots, to look up addresses for precinct workers and to dispense
information.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope it gets them inspired and into voting early," said
Candace Pickel, who coordinates the program for the Ventura County
Elections Division. "They must have 2.5 grade point averages and be
nominated by a teacher. They tend to be good students, young and
strong and on their toes."</TE>
<TE>   About 100 seniors were chosen to work in about 100 polling places.
They were paid up to $65 for the day, and some received class credit.</TE>
<TE>   Whitney, who participates in student government, said she wanted
to see democracy -- despite its occasional sluggishness -- in action.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some kids who care less," she said. "But many read the
paper even more than adults."</TE>
<TE>   Contentious development issues such as Ventura's Measure A, which
called for 1,390 new homes to be built in the hills, also energized
students.</TE>
<TE>   "Measure A is huge at the high school," Whitney said. "The kids
seem to split down the middle. Many take whatever position their
parents take."</TE>
<TE>   At Christa McAuliffe Elementary School in Oxnard, 17-year-old
Sarah Gomez sorted ballots in the library. She said students care
deeply about politics.</TE>
<TE>   "People in my government class are always asking why we are going
to war, why can't we use the money for people here instead of wasting
it on war," said Sarah, a senior at Rio Mesa High School in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   She was surprised at how many steps were involved in casting a
vote.</TE>
<TE>   "I have heard some kids say their votes don't count, but then look
at what happened in the last election when people didn't vote," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Selma Pearlmutter, an elections inspector for five years, said
this was the first time she has worked with high school students at
the polls.</TE>
<TE>   "They are getting hands-on experience," she said, looking over at
17-year-old Zac Haines, a Rio Mesa senior. "At the end of the day, I
want him to see what's at stake. I want him to see how the process
will affect him, so when it's his time to vote, he'll understand."</TE>
<TE>   While Zac acknowledged that working at the polls was an
enlightening experience, he had more immediate motivations. "My
teacher will give me 50 extra credit points and I get paid," he said.</TE>

<HD>Incumbents Lead in Council Races</HD>
<DH>Officeholders in Simi Valley, Camarillo and Moorpark
coasting, while those in Thousand Oaks, Ojai and Oxnard seem headed
for victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a good night for incumbents in city council races throughout
Ventura County, with officeholders sweeping to victory in Camarillo,
Simi Valley and Moorpark. They also held early leads in Thousand
Oaks, Ojai and Oxnard.</LD>
<LD>   In the bitter Thousand Oaks campaign, which featured squabbles
over the pace of development, incumbents Andy Fox, Dennis Gillette
and Dan Del Campo led in the race for three council seats.</LD>
<LD>   They were pitted against a "slow-growth team" that included
Planning Commissioner Claudia Bill-de la Pena, former Planning
Commissioner Michael Farris and English teacher Laura Lee Custodio.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm extremely happy and gratified that the residents of Thousand
Oaks appreciated the positive campaign that we ran and our efforts
and hard work over the last four years," said Fox, the top
vote-getter in early results.</TE>
<TE>   In a special election to replace incoming Ventura County
Supervisor Linda Parks, millionaire businessman Randy Hoffman was
locked in a virtual dead heat with restaurant owner Bob Wilson Sr.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley voters easily returned Mayor Bill Davis and Councilmen
Paul Miller and Glen T. Becerra to office.</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard, Mayor Manuel Lopez and incumbent Councilman Dean
Maulhardt retained their seats.</TE>
<TE>   In the race for three seats in Santa Paula, incumbent Councilman
Rick Cook was among the early leaders. But high school Principal
Gabino Aguirre, urban planner Mary Ann Krause and land-use planner
Rita Graham were also running strong.</TE>
<TE>   In an election where nine of the county's 10 cities voted for
council members, growth emerged as the overriding issue.</TE>
<TE>   In Thousand Oaks, the battle unfolded along time-honored lines as
a slate of slow-growth City Council challengers accused incumbents of
being too cozy with developers.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the 12 candidates--Wilson, Bill-de la Pena, Farris and
Custodio--ran as an environmental bloc in a sometimes-nasty campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Gillette was accused of using the city seal improperly in
brochures, but city lawyers saw no violation.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman called Wilson a Lake Sherwood carpetbagger who rented an
apartment in the city days before filing for office. Wilson said he
has lived in or near Thousand Oaks for three decades.</TE>
<TE>   In Simi Valley, candidates focused much of their attention on
ballot Measure B, which sought to shrink the city's growth boundaries
and effectively kill proposals for more than 2,000 houses.</TE>
<TE>   All three incumbents, and all but one of the mayoral and council
challengers, opposed the measure.</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard, which is the fastest-growing city in the county,
candidates squared off over how to provide services for new
developments, including the 2,800-home RiverPark project.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard appeared to have addressed its sprawling growth in 1998,
when voters blocked urban development on most of the surrounding
farmland. But growth within the city was an issue, with several
candidates saying the pace of development had outstripped city
services.</TE>
<TE>   No city had more election day decisions than Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   Voters elected three council members, determined the fate of a
ballot growth measure and decided whether to carve the mostly Latino
community into five voting districts.</TE>
<TE>   The seven candidates agreed that the next council needed to boost
Santa Paula's sagging economy, curb crime and smooth racial tensions.</TE>
<TE>   A federal lawsuit two years ago alleged that the city's at-large
voting system had perpetuated racial discrimination. City leaders
agreed last year to let voters decide whether to elect council
members by district.</TE>

<HD>Gallegly and Capps Well Ahead</HD>
<DH>Incumbents for the state Assembly are also heading to
victory, thanks partly to funding advantages and redrawn districts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Incumbents were headed to decisive victories Tuesday in Ventura
County's races for state Assembly and Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Leading Democratic opponent Fern Rudin by about 2 to 1, Rep. Elton
Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) was on his way to a ninth term in Congress.</LD>
<LD>   "It always feels good to win," said Gallegly before joining the
county Republican Central Committee in a tailgate party outside the
courthouse in Ventura. Gallegly said he was particularly pleased
because it was his first victory in inland Santa Barbara County, a
new part of his district.</LD>
<TE>   The apparent margin of victory was smaller for Rep. Lois Capps
(D-Santa Barbara), but she was still far ahead of Beth Rogers, a
Republican businesswoman from a pioneering Ventura County farming
family.</TE>
<TE>   In Assembly races, Democratic incumbent Fran Pavley (D-Agoura
Hills) was easily beating Michael Wissot, a San Fernando Valley
Internet entrepreneur.</TE>
<TE>   "My victory reaffirms what I really believe: My district values
environmental protection, quality education, and an activist
government," said Pavley, whose centerpiece bill was the nation's
first ban on vehicular greenhouse gases.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Tony Strickland (R-Moorpark) appeared headed to an
overwhelming victory over Democratic businessman Bruce Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   And Republican incumbent Keith Richman, whose district overlaps
Simi Valley and the west San Fernando Valley, was a runaway winner
over Democrat Paula Calderon.</TE>
<TE>   With Republican challenger Bob Pohl out of the race because of
cancer, Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) was
cruising to her third term.</TE>
<TE>   Incumbents were further boosted by the once-a-decade redrawing of
their districts. Each of Ventura County's state and federal
incumbents ended up with more voters of his or her own party after
redistricting.</TE>
<TE>   With local challengers in those races at a greater disadvantage
than usual, the major parties for the most part did not pour
resources into their campaigns. Making her first bid for elected
office, Rudin raised less than $5,000 to unseat Gallegly, whose
treasury topped $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the challengers had never held office, although some had
political experience. Rudin ran the Clinton-Gore campaigns in eastern
Ventura County. Wissot was formerly employed by Sen. John McCain.</TE>
<TE>   The Capps-Rogers race drew the most attention, generating
contributions of more than $2.7 million. Rogers was seen as a strong
contender, with credentials that included party activism and
experience running her family's 200-employee sod farm.</TE>

<HD>Growth Measures Face Decisive Defeat in Ventura, Santa
Paula</HD>
<DH>Bids for new housing developments trail by large margins.
Voters in Simi Valley, Ojai appear unwilling to adopt more stringent
restrictions.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Voters in Ventura and Santa Paula were rejecting by large margins
Tuesday two major expansions to their cities, apparently defeating
costly landowner-backed measures to build thousands of new homes.</LD>
<LD>   But in Simi Valley, slow-growth activists were losing a bid to
further restrict development, early returns showed. And in Ojai,
voters apparently found too restrictive a measure that limited growth
if it significantly increased traffic.</LD>
<LD>   The Ventura hillside development measure was trailing 2 to 1 in
early returns, ending a bitter campaign marred by destroyed signs and
allegations of misrepresentations on both sides.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's really clear that the voters didn't want this
project and resented the way the developers presented it," said
county Supervisor Steve Bennett, a leading opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "This shows that grass-roots citizenship can turn back
million-dollar efforts by developers if they work hard, hang together
and run good campaigns," Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   And in Santa Paula, the apparent loss of an Arizona developer's
bid to clear the way for a large housing project in remote Adams
Canyon will force city leaders to consider other options as they try
to revive the struggling town.</TE>
<TE>   Cheers erupted at attorney Jim Procter's Santa Paula home when
initial results were announced.</TE>
<TE>   "This confirms for me that the people of Santa Paula know a bad
deal when they see one and that votes can't be bought," Procter said.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday marked the first major test of anti-sprawl laws that
Ventura County voters began adopting in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura, voters considered Measure A, the hotly debated
hillside development initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Backed by more than $1 million from family landowners Lloyd
Properties, the measure proposed building 1,390 homes in six
neighborhoods across five miles of hills that form the backdrop of
the seaside city.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, 3,050 acres of new trails, parks and open space were
promised to a public land trust.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters billed the offer as a great deal for the city,
protecting the Two Trees hilltop and adding to the community's tight
housing market.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see how we can lose," said resident Alison Mizraji.</TE>
<TE>   But the measure faced fierce opposition from a well-organized
group of slow-growth activists and city residents, many of whom live
near the proposed project.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents said the project would generate too much traffic. They
also said the measure would place too light a financial burden on the
developer-landowners to build new schools, without which existing
classrooms would become overcrowded with children living in the new,
upscale homes.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Fulton, a planning expert based in Ventura and a leading
opponent, accused the landowners of rewriting city codes to squeeze
far more houses into the steep hillsides than current regulations
would allow.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents also objected to Measure A's timing, coming to voters
before environmental studies of the land were completed. "It's not
the best deal we can cut," Fulton said.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict produced one of the most divisive campaigns in recent
Ventura history. Signs were stolen and at least three police reports
were filed in connection with alleged vandalism, theft and
harassment.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Paula, Measure F also divided the town.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative proposed to redraw the city's voter-approved growth
boundary to include Adams Canyon, cattle grazing land that could
support up to 2,250 new homes and a 50,000-square-foot strip mall.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters, including the project's Arizona developer and a long
list of current and former elected officials, argued that such
suburban development is the only way to jolt the farm town out of
economic stagnation.</TE>
<TE>   Pinnacle, the developer, and other business interests spent
$750,000 promoting the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents, made up of mostly growth-control activists and city
residents, said Santa Paula should grow by investing in its existing
city core.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of creating sprawl in 5,413-acre Adams Canyon, they said,
more housing could be built by converting dilapidated buildings and
vacant lots downtown.</TE>
<TE>   They championed a vision of a Santa Paula that would draw new
employers and customers to retail shops by promoting its small-town
environment.</TE>
<TE>   In Simi Valley, voters considered a second generation of
growth-control measures that would further shrink boundaries for
urban expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Activists in the fast-growing suburb near the San Fernando Valley
want to block two proposed housing projects by redrawing growth lines
voters approved in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   City leaders and other opponents of Measure B saw the move as a
betrayal, saying the two projects are key to ensuring the city's
success as a vibrant, job-rich community over the next 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   They warned voters that approving the initiative would put the
city's future in the hands of the county Board of Supervisors rather
than the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in tiny Ojai, voters considered ballot Measure C that
would prohibit the City Council from approving projects that
significantly increase traffic without voter consent.</TE>
<TE>   Backers said the measure would ensure that new construction would
not overwhelm the tourist town's road system.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents called it the "measure of unintended consequences,"
saying it would stop projects that residents would otherwise welcome,
such as a planned hospital expansion.</TE>

<HD>Vote Split for 2 College District Trustees</HD>
<DH>Early returns show Art Hernandez headed for victory in Area
5, and John Tallman falling behind challenger in Area 1.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Voters angered by a scandal that forced the resignation of former
community college district Chancellor Philip Westin spoke with two
voices Tuesday, apparently reelecting one incumbent while leaving the
fate of a second up in the air.</LD>
<LD>   Oxnard-area trustee Art Hernandez appeared headed for victory in
early results over his closest challenger, Sylvia Munoz Schnopp.</LD>
<LD>   But trustee John Tallman, a longtime Westin critic who represents
Ventura, was falling behind challenger Mary Anne Rooney in early
results.</LD>
<TE>   "I would have thought it would have gone the other way," said
activist David Maron. "Maybe there was a mix of candidates that are
splitting the vote against Hernandez."</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl Heitmann was winning a seat to represent Thousand Oaks on
the board, replacing retiring trustee Norman Nagel.</TE>
<TE>   In other school board races, Oak Park voters apparently avoided a
quandary by not reelecting incumbent Bob Kahn, who died Monday.
Kahn's death as he was running for a fourth term had raised the
possibility of an appointment or special election.</TE>
<TE>   In the Oxnard Union High School District, incumbents Irene Pinkard
and Robert Valles appeared headed to victory in early results,
although Valles was embroiled in a controversy after a board majority
fired former Supt. Bill Studt last year. Socorro Lopez Hanson was
poised to take the third seat.</TE>
<TE>   In the community college races, voters had a chance to express
their opinions about the financial scandal that forced Westin's
resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez and Tallman faced a field of challengers running on a
platform to clean up the five-member board after it was revealed that
Westin spent $119,000 over four years on expensive meals, car repairs
and electronics.</TE>
<TE>   The incumbents up for re-election were the only board members to
oppose Westin's resignation settlement, which will pay him a salary
of $203,000 for another year and gives him lifetime health benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Westin resigned even though an internal investigation found he had
broken no laws or district rules. But critics said change is needed
anyway to restore public confidence in the 34,000-student district
and to ensure that unchecked executive spending doesn't happen again.</TE>
<TE>   The new trustees will help select the next chancellor, balance a
shrinking budget and decide how to spend a $356-million bond to
improve the district's campuses in Ventura, Oxnard and Moorpark.</TE>
<TE>   In Area 5, representing most of Oxnard, El Rio and Port Hueneme,
Hernandez did not appear dogged by his vote in May to extend Westin's
contract and to give him a $30,000 raise, even though Hernandez and
the other trustees were aware of Westin's spending habits.</TE>
<TE>   In Area 1, which covers Ventura and parts of Oxnard and Port
Hueneme, Tallman was the only trustee to vote against the Westin
raise, which was awarded two months after the board had first asked
Westin to resign for allegedly abusing his expense account.</TE>
<TE>   Around the county, voters were poised to determine the outcome of
other key school board races.</TE>
<TE>   In the Rio Elementary School District campaign that was couched as
a referendum of its top administrator, voters were splitting their
support. A slate of three candidates backed by county Supervisor John
Flynn vowed to oust Supt. Yolanda Benitez, Flynn's political rival.
But others on the ballot for three open seats said Flynn had no
business interfering with a local school board race.</TE>
<TE>   At the Oxnard High School District, a key issue the new school
board will face is whether to allow Camarillo and Rio Mesa high
schools to leave the district and join the Pleasant Valley School
District.</TE>

<HD>Russia Seeks Extradition of Exiled Tycoon</HD>
<DH>The Kremlin asks Britain to send back oligarch to face
charges in auto thefts. In a separate case, a Chechen leader is also
sought.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Holley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>MOSCOW -- Pushing the Kremlin's fight with a once-powerful oligarch
onto the international stage, Russian prosecutors have asked Britain
to extradite self-exiled tycoon Boris A. Berezovsky to face
corruption charges, authorities said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Berezovsky, a onetime Kremlin insider who helped make or break
prime ministers and presidents, is one of President Vladimir V.
Putin's most vociferous critics.</LD>
<LD>   A Moscow court issued an arrest warrant for Berezovsky and two
associates last week on charges of fraud in connection with the
1994-95 theft of cars worth $13 million from Russia's largest auto
maker, Avtovaz. Berezovsky says the charges are politically
motivated.</LD>
<TE>   In a separate action Tuesday, Vladimir B. Rushailo, secretary of
Putin's Security Council, demanded that Georgia capture and extradite
Ruslan Gelayev, a Chechen separatist leader who the Kremlin believes
is in that former Soviet republic, using the wild Pankisi Gorge as a
base for attacks on neighboring Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Russian forces pressed forward with security sweeps in Chechnya on
Tuesday, evicting residents and then blowing up two apartment
buildings near a military base to prevent rebel fighters from using
them to stage attacks. On Sunday, a missile fired from a launcher in
a ruined five-story building on the outskirts of the Chechen capital,
Grozny, brought down a Russian helicopter, killing nine soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Further pressing a tough line on the separatist republic in the
wake of the recent seizure of a Moscow theater by Chechen rebels,
Putin's human rights envoy for Chechnya urged Russian rights
activists Tuesday to cancel a planned conference on peace in the
republic.</TE>
<TE>   Holding the weekend conference would be tantamount to giving in to
the demands of terrorists, said the envoy, Abdul-Khakim Sultygov.</TE>
<TE>   After Putin's rise to the presidency, Berezovsky disagreed with
him on some key domestic policy issues, including the president's
tough line on Chechnya. Their break, according to Berezovsky, came
when Putin complained after the August 2000 sinking of the nuclear
submarine Kursk about the coverage of the disaster on ORT television,
which Berezovsky controlled through a 49% ownership share.</TE>
<TE>   "This feud between the Kremlin and Berezovsky has been very
actively waged by both sides for a few years already," said Andrei
Piontkovsky, director of the Independent Institute for Strategic
Studies in Moscow. "Today a new and very strong move was finally made
by the Kremlin, which refrained from it for quite a while, apparently
because both Putin and Berezovsky knew quite a lot about each other
and didn't really want to come to extremes."</TE>
<TE>   Berezovsky brought the extradition move on himself because he "has
made fun of the Kremlin for two years, saying that he is not hiding
and is ready to face any charges and that the Kremlin wouldn't dare
go to Interpol for him," Piontkovsky said. "Putin's patience finally
ran out."</TE>
<TE>   Piontkovsky added that he believes the fraud charges are "solid
and real" and predicted that Britain may eventually extradite
Berezovsky. But the extradition process, if it moves forward, "may
take about a year, and has the potential of reaching the House of
Lords," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Britain's Home Office, which would deal with the extradition
request, had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   Since fleeing to London, saying that he no longer felt safe in
Russia, Berezovsky has offered himself as a rallying point for
liberal opposition to Putin.</TE>
<TE>   Among the charges Berezovsky makes is that Putin's rise to power
came about through a conspiracy orchestrated by the Federal Security
Service, or FSB, the domestic successor to the Soviet-era KGB.
Berezovsky has alleged that the FSB is responsible for apartment
house bombings in 1999 that stoked public emotion against Chechnya.
The bombings, which authorities blamed on Chechen rebels, have never
been solved.</TE>

<HD>Bill to Allow the Transfer of Trials Wins Passage in Italy</HD>
<DH>Critics call the measure a move to protect prime minister,
embroiled in a corruption case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Holley and Maria De Cristofaro</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>Italy's Parliament approved a bill Tuesday that critics charge is
designed to save conservative Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi from
criminal punishment on corruption charges.</LD>
<LD>   Center-left lawmakers opposed to the measure shouted, "Thieves!
Thieves!" as it moved toward passage. They then boycotted the final
vote. The lower house of Parliament approved the bill Tuesday, 310 to
4, with one abstention. It had already passed the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents organized evening protests that included distribution of
leaflets urging President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi not to sign the bill.
His signature, however, is widely expected.</LD>
<TE>   "Today is a black page for Italian justice," said Francesco
Rutelli, leader of the opposition Olive Tree coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Berlusconi, a billionaire businessman-turned-politician, is on
trial in the northern city of Milan for allegedly bribing judges in
the 1980s when they were ruling on the sale of a state-owned food
company.</TE>
<TE>   His onetime business associate and former defense minister, Cesare
Previti, faces a separate corruption trial in Milan on related
charges. Previti is a lawmaker in the prime minister's Forza Italia
party.</TE>
<TE>   Both men deny the accusations, which they contend are politically
motivated.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters argue that the bill -- which allows defendants to seek
a change of court venue if there is a "legitimate suspicion" that
judges are biased against them -- aims to ensure fair trials.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed law, trials would be suspended until a ruling
is issued on a defendant's allegation of bias. If the claim is
upheld, the trial would start again from the beginning in another
court.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Berlusconi and Previti have said that they will use
the legislation to try to shift the proceedings elsewhere. Success in
that would cause delays that could make it impossible for prosecutors
to win convictions before the statute of limitations expires.</TE>
<TE>   Approval of the bill shows that Italy is a country "where it's
possible to create laws, during ongoing legal processes, with the
clear intent to save people who are under investigation," complained
Marina Astrologo, one of the protest organizers. "This puts us as
maybe more toward the level of a South American dictatorship than a
civil and democratic country which is within a liberal Western
world."</TE>
<TE>   Italy's top magistrates body, the Superior Council of Magistrates,
recently warned that the measure could weaken the fight against
organized crime by allowing accused Mafiosi to seek changes of venue.
The definition of "legitimate suspicion" of judicial bias was too
vague, it said.</TE>
<TE>   A somewhat similar "legitimate suspicion" rule allowing trial
transfers was part of Italian law until a 1989 penal code reform. It
was removed after complaints that it led to massive backlogs and
allowed defendants to disrupt trial proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Critics argue that Berlusconi -- Italy's richest person and head
of a vast media empire -- has used his dominance of Italian
television to mislead much of the public and thereby escape serious
political damage from his legal machinations.</TE>
<TE>   The pro-Berlusconi majority in Parliament earlier pushed through
other measures also seen by critics as designed to get the prime
minister off the legal hook. Those pieces of legislation partly
decriminalized false bookkeeping and reduced its statute of
limitations, and made it harder for Italian courts to use evidence
from other countries.</TE>
<TE>   A panel of judges in Milan on Tuesday acquitted Berlusconi in a
separate case of accounting fraud involving a soccer team he owns,
ruling that under the new bookkeeping legislation the statute of
limitations had expired.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had accused Berlusconi of falsifying the books of his
soccer club, AC Milan, when registering the transfer of soccer star
Gianluigi Lentini from another team. They charged that an
under-the-table payment was made to the club that gave up Lentini.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliano Ferrara -- editor of Il Foglio daily and widely seen as
close to the prime minister -- said he believes that the new
legislation is meant "to save Mr. Berlusconi from the judges" but
that "the crusading judge" is a real Italian problem.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Tana de Zulueta, an opposition lawmaker, said Tuesday that
Berlusconi and his government "got what they wanted" but "paid a very
high price in terms of credibility."</TE>
<TE>   "The notion that the legislation has been tailor-made to suit
private interest has taken hold," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A parliamentary group including De Zulueta, called the Law Is
Equal for Everybody, organized a protest piano concert Tuesday
evening in Piazza Navona, one of Rome's most picturesque squares.</TE>
<TE>   The piano theme was chosen because when the Senate voted for the
"legitimate suspicion" bill, about two dozen senators were caught on
film casting not only their own ballots but also those of allied
senators who were away from their seats. To do so, they worked two
voting keyboards at once, one with each hand. They were quickly
dubbed "pianists."</TE>

part of his campaign for the presidency, pledging to reform what he
called "inefficient and corrupt" politics.</LD>
<LD>   Chung Mong Jun's party, National Unity 21, was launched as the
nation's faction-ridden political parties jockeyed for position ahead
of the Dec. 19 vote.</LD>
<LD>   Chung said his party will promote peaceful coexistence with
communist North Korea and strive for faster economic development. His
campaign pledge was broad and lacked specifics.</LD>

<LD>North Korea says it will resume missile test launches unless Tokyo
stops making Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program and the fate of five
Japanese abductees central to normalizing relations.</LD>
<LD>   North Korea's official news agency said Japan's stance on the
abductees and its demands that North Korea stop developing nuclear
arms are "creating very serious issues as [they are] illogical."</LD>
<LD>   Officials from the two sides held a round of normalization talks
last month. But the talks bogged down, and North Korea now says Japan
is violating agreements on the abductees.</LD>

<LD>Workers at a Romanian car factory have decided to donate sperm to get
the debt-ridden plant out of the red.</LD>
<LD>   "Our feasibility study shows that if 1,000 workers donate their
sperm for several months, we can get enough funds to pay part of the
plant's debts," said Ion Cotescu, trade union leader at ARO
Campulung.</LD>
<LD>   He said the decision was made after media reports said a fertility
clinic in the western city of Timisoara offered donors $50 a visit.
The plant's debts are put at $20 million.</LD>

<LD>Britain's upper chamber of Parliament voted to lift a ban on
unmarried and gay couples adopting children.</LD>
<LD>   The House of Lords' approval came after the House of Commons voted
for the measure, meaning it now is almost certain to become law. That
would make Britain the fifth European country to allow gay couples to
adopt, along with Sweden, Denmark, Iceland and the Netherlands.</LD>
<LD>   Under current British law, single heterosexuals and homosexuals
may adopt children, but unwed and gay couples cannot.</LD>

<HD>A Holy Month Brings Comfort to Worried Muslims in Mideast</HD>
<DH>As they begin 30 days of daily fasting and nightly
feasting, Egyptians typify a region troubled by terror and fear of
war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Lamb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>The holy month of Ramadan began Tuesday with the sighting of the
crescent moon over Saudi Arabia. It swept west with the glow of the
sunset, bringing comfort and hope to a region darkened by the shadows
of terrorism and the threat of war.</LD>
<LD>   "Things are very bad for Muslims right now," said Mona Abdel
Barri, a Cairo cleaning woman. "But Ramadan makes everyone closer and
helps us forget our problems. People start to think of others instead
of just themselves. Ramadan is a month of good."</LD>
<LD>   For the world's 1.2 billion Muslims, the ninth lunar month is a
time to renew one's commitment to God through prayer, charitable
deeds and abstinence. For 30 days, fasting begins at sunrise and
continues until, in Cairo, the firing of a cannon at sunset sends
hungry families hurrying home for a nightly feast.</LD>
<TE>   They rush home through streets bedecked with bright paper flags
and Chinese-made tin lanterns, past mosques festooned with lights and
merchants' stalls stockpiled with the foods of Ramadan.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most popular items are dates, which are named each
season in light of current events. Last year, during the U.S.-led war
in Afghanistan, the best-quality dates were known as Bin Ladens, the
worst as Bushes. This year they are Leilas and Sharons (for Egyptian
movie star Leila Alwi and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon).</TE>
<TE>   Although Ramadan is a period of reflection and celebration, many
Arabs say foreboding tempers their happiness this year. The plight of
Palestinians is a source of anger and despair. The threat of a war in
Iraq raises fears of a region engulfed in conflict. And terrorism,
carried out under the banner of religion from Bali to New York, has
cast Arab Muslims into the unwanted limelight of worldly
apprehension.</TE>
<TE>   "These terrorist acts have absolutely no relation to religion at
all and no relationship to sane minds," said Mohammed Sayed Tantawi,
who, as the grand sheik of Cairo's thousand-year-old Islamic
institution, Al Azhar University, speaks with one of the region's
most influential voices.</TE>
<TE>   "These are acts of madmen who do not know religion. They don't
understand the rights of others," he said. "These acts are done by
people by their own will and with whisperings from the devil."</TE>
<TE>   The mood in the Arab world aside, the holy month brings this year,
as usual, a fulfilling sense of self-discipline undertaken in the
name of God. From Riyadh in Saudi Arabia to Marrakech in Morocco,
millions stomp out their cigarettes. Alcohol is forsworn in favor of
sahlabs, a drink made from ground orchid bulbs, warm milk, nuts and
cinnamon.</TE>
<TE>   After breaking their daily fast, Arabs pour into the streets,
where stores open about 9 p.m. and coffee shops stay busy until the
fast begins at dawn. Everyone straggles into work late the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Fasting during Ramadan is one of Islam's five pillars, along with
reciting daily prayers, giving alms, making the pilgrimage to Mecca
and affirming Muhammad as the prophet of God. The prophet excused
from observing the fast pregnant women, travelers, the sick and
soldiers at war -- the latter because the holy month does not always
bring a cessation of hostilities. The late Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat used the cover of Ramadan to go to war against Israel in 1973
after consulting with Islamic experts who ruled that his soldiers
would not have to fast.</TE>
<TE>   Just before the first strike, Sadat saw that his officers were
apparently fasting. He scolded them, saying that their utmost
concentration was needed and asking why no one was smoking or
drinking.</TE>
<TE>   "I noticed they were very embarrassed," Sadat later wrote, "so I
ordered some tea for myself and lighted my pipe--whereupon they began
to smoke and order tea."</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>French intelligence agents arrested eight suspects Tuesday in the
bombing of a Tunisian synagogue that killed 21 people in April, the
Interior Ministry said.</LD>
<LD>   Al Qaeda, the terrorist network the U.S. blames for the Sept. 11,
2001, attacks, claimed responsibility for the tanker truck explosion,
which occurred outside the Ghriba synagogue on the southern Tunisian
island of Djerba.</LD>
<LD>   Documents seized during the arrests in suburbs of Lyon appear to
directly link the suspects and the April 11 bombing, the Interior
Ministry said.</LD>
<TE>   French judicial sources said those arrested included friends and
family of the 24-year-old truck driver, who was among those killed in
the bombing, which authorities called a suicide attack.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen Germans, five Tunisians and a Frenchman were also killed
when the tanker truck containing cooking gas exploded near the
synagogue.</TE>
<TE>   The Interior Ministry said France's leading anti-terrorist judge,
Jean-Louis Bruguiere, had requested a probe into relatives of the
driver, Nizar Nouar.</TE>
<TE>   Judicial sources said Nouar's father, mother, brother and
brother-in-law, as well as friends of the family, were among those
arrested. An uncle was arrested in Tunisia.</TE>

<LD>   Abdollah Nouri, a cleric and close ally of President Mohammad

<LD>   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei granted the pardon after a request from the
parliament speaker and legislators. Nouri was sentenced in 1999 for
saying Khamenei -- who conservatives believe answers only to God --
was not above the law.</LD>

<DL>NANCY, France</DL>
<LD>Twelve people died in a fire on an overnight express train near the
northeastern French city of Nancy today, local officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The victims apparently died from inhaling smoke, which Nancy
railway staff noticed as the train rumbled through on its way from
Paris. It was headed to Vienna via Strasbourg.</LD>
<LD>   About 10 people were injured in the fire, which occurred about
2:15 a.m. in the two front cars of the train. About 150 people were
on board.</LD>
<TE>   The injured were taken to a university hospital in Nancy. Regional
official Jean-Francois Cordet said Americans, as well as French,
British and German nationals, were among those hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "The station staff noticed one of the cars had smoke in it," one
local official told France Info radio. The train was stopped just
outside the Nancy station and rescue workers rushed to it.</TE>
<TE>   "They realized on opening the doors that there was a fire and a
certain number of people were already dead," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Local police said the fatalities consisted of six men, five women
and a child. The victims, apparently foreigners, were traveling in
two German railways sleeper cars, and officials said they appeared to
have died in their sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities tentatively attributed the cause to a heating system
malfunction.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy city officials opened a local gymnasium to receive the rest
of the passengers from the train while they waited for other
transport.</TE>
<TE>   Fatal train accidents are extremely rare in France, whose
high-speed rail network is a model for other countries.</TE>

<HD>Mauritius' Envoy to U.N. Gets the Boot for Not Toeing the
Line</HD>
<DH>Ambassador is recalled for not conveying his government's
pro-U.S. stance in the Security Council debate over how to disarm
Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>UNITED NATIONS -- Missing: one soft-spoken, full-bearded Mauritian
ambassador with independent views. Last seen leaving a Security
Council meeting without throwing his full support behind the U.S.
resolution on Iraq. May have run afoul of perceived American economic
pressures in the diplomatic arena.</LD>
<LD>   Mauritius recalled its U.N. ambassador, Jagdish Koonjul, on Friday
for not accurately conveying his government's pro-American stance in
the Security Council debate over how to disarm Iraq, a senior
official from the Indian Ocean island nation said this week.</LD>
<LD>   The White House was so concerned that Mauritius was not squarely
behind Washington on the resolution that it recently sent a formal
warning to the capital. Mauritius' response was swift and clear --
Koonjul didn't show up for his Friday meetings at the U.N. because he
was packing to go home.</LD>
<TE>   "We support the United States," said Foreign Minister Anil Gayan
-- just as the U.S. had supported Mauritius' bid to become a rotating
council member. "Our position is not neutral."</TE>
<TE>   For both Mauritius and the U.S., more than diplomatic harmony is
at stake. Mauritius' concern over solidarity with the U.S. may well
have an economic subtext. Some Mauritian officials fear that
Koonjul's equivocal stance on the resolution could cost them access
to the U.S. market under a recent trade program that explicitly
requires support of American foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   The 2000 African Growth and Opportunity Act, which provides trade
benefits to 34 sub-Saharan countries, stipulates that recipients must
not "engage in activities that undermine United States national
security or foreign policy interests." The program, a Clinton
administration initiative, illustrates a growing trend of linking
economic issues with Washington's foreign policy objectives.</TE>
<TE>   "The new American trade agenda serves U.S. security interests,"
U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick wrote in Monday's Wall
Street Journal. "Ultimately, free trade is about freedom. This value
is at the heart of our larger reform and development agenda."</TE>
<TE>   Trade expert Jagdish Bhagwati, a professor at Columbia University,
said that although Washington is increasingly using trade for
noneconomic purposes such as improving labor standards and pushing
for democracy, the demand for political support is usually not so
explicit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a rather naked exercise of political linkage," he said.
"It's like baksheesh diplomacy. We're telling trade partners, 'We
will let you have market access provided you do the following.' "</TE>
<TE>   Mauritius, an island off the east coast of Africa, isn't the only
Security Council member subject to the political requirements.
Council members Cameroon and Guinea also receive trade benefits under
the same act, putting these three Francophone nations in the
cross-fire of French and U.S. lobbying efforts at the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has formally presented a draft resolution
calling for "severe consequences" if Iraq fails to cooperate with
weapons inspectors. France, Russia and others are trying to ensure
that any eventual resolution not automatically authorize the U.S. and
partners to use force against Iraq without council approval.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly two months of talks have put intense pressure on all 15
Security Council members, but the U.S. is hoping that a refined draft
to be presented today will win wide agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats from Cameroon say that their oil sector and their desire
for trade give them common interests with France and the U.S. and
that they hope a compromise resolution will mean that they don't have
to choose.</TE>
<TE>   "We are friends with the U.S., we are friends with France," said
Blaise Banoum, a counselor at Cameroon's mission to the U.N. "But we
are thinking about the resolution -- we are not thinking about
friendship. We think that the positions are coming closer, and by the
end, the resolution will be one supported by the maximum number of
the members."</TE>
<TE>   Mauritian Ambassador Koonjul has been carefully noncommittal at
the U.N. -- so much so that at one point, France and the United
States both counted Mauritius as supporting the other side. Although
that stance elevated Mauritius' status as a key swing vote in the
council, it didn't go down well at home.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position on this issue is very clear," Gayan, the foreign
minister, said in a telephone interview Monday with The Times. "If
there is consensus, we will go along. If there is no consensus, we
will support the United States and United Kingdom. The ambassador has
been recalled for not following strictly the instructions that were
given him."</TE>
<TE>   Using aid as both incentive and arm-twister isn't a new approach.
During the 1990 Security Council vote authorizing the Persian Gulf
War, Washington offered nearly every developing country on the
council economic aid packages -- and cut Yemen's $70-million foreign
aid package after that country cast a no vote. But the economic
aspect to negotiations over this resolution is more overt than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much at stake for the administration on this that they
will use every lever possible," a U.S. State Department official
said.</TE>

<HD>4 Palestinians Admit to Fatal Attacks, Court Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Four Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem pleaded guilty Tuesday
to direct involvement in a series of bombings in the ancient city,
including an attack that killed five Americans at Hebrew University,
court officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said the Palestinians belonged to a militant cell that
orchestrated attacks that also included a suicide bombing in a
Jerusalem cafe in March that killed 11 Israelis.</LD>
<LD>   One of the Palestinians, house painter Mohammed Odeh, admitted to
planting the bomb in the Hebrew University cafeteria this summer.
Nine people were killed, including the Americans.</LD>
<TE>   The Palestinians were charged with attacks that took a total of 35
lives.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most Palestinians in the West Bank, Palestinians living in
East Jerusalem have Israeli identity cards. This allowed the four to
travel freely in Israel and plan the attacks, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors demanded that three of the four be given life
sentences.</TE>
<TE>   The court postponed sentencing until December.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, violence continued Tuesday. In the southern Gaza Strip,
Israeli soldiers came under fire and responded with gunfire, killing
two Palestinians and injuring 19, according to the army and
Palestinian officials.</TE>
<TE>   The army said the Israeli troops faced machine-gun fire from two
armed Palestinians who approached a military checkpoint near Rafah,
along the border with Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   The army said it hit two Palestinians and reported antitank fire
by Palestinians as it searched for a third.</TE>

<HD>Sharon's Move on Elections Seen as Boon to the U.S.</HD>
<DH>Decision for early vote suggests Israeli leader will retain
policy toward Palestinians, analysts say. They also expect a stable
government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Richter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's sudden decision to dissolve
parliament and call early elections was a welcome move for the Bush
administration, experts said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "From the U.S. standpoint, it's probably better to get this thing
out of the way and have a solid government in place," said Edward S.
Walker Jr., president of the Middle East Institute in Washington and
a former assistant secretary of State.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon cited his desire to preserve Israel's relationship with the
United States -- and his own relationship with the White House -- in
calling elections nearly 10 months early.</LD>
<TE>   Forming a narrow coalition government with small, far-right
parties would have placed intolerable strains on those bonds, Sharon
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was an extraordinary statement for a politician once considered
persona non grata in Washington, seen as a loose cannon who
deliberately undermined U.S. peacemaking efforts.</TE>
<TE>   During the first Bush administration, as a minister in Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government, Sharon clashed head on with
then-Secretary of State James A. Baker III over the construction of
new Jewish settlements.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, members of the current Bush administration took a
cautious approach to the news Tuesday, saying that the elections are
a domestic Israeli matter.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an internal issue to Israel's democracy," said White
House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer. "Israel handles its democratic
issues as any good democracy should."</TE>
<TE>   And U.S. officials said they intend to press ahead with President
Bush's latest proposal for peace between the Israelis and
Palestinians, known as the "road map."</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to continue to work this process," said State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher. "Both parties will have
obligations and responsibilities in it, not dependent on a particular
government."</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon's refusal to pay the price that far-right parties were
demanding to form a new governing coalition makes it less likely that
the Israeli government will suddenly launch a new crackdown on the
Palestinians or a new Jewish settlement drive in the West Bank --
moves likely to antagonize moderate Arab governments as the U.S.
prepares for a possible war against Iraq, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not do anything to change our special relationship with
the U.S.," the prime minister said. "I made it clear that I am not
going to change the guidelines or the commitments that I took upon
myself in my talks with the White House."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's eagerness to show Israeli voters that he has a solid
relationship with Bush suggests that the prime minister will try to
maintain the status quo of limited retaliations for Palestinian
attacks and a commitment not to expel Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Over the longer term, the elections may benefit the United States
by giving Israel a stable government rather than one that is weak and
whipsawed by rapidly shifting policies.</TE>
<TE>   Six days after the left-of-center Labor Party left his coalition,
Sharon dissolved the parliament, or Knesset, on Tuesday and called
elections for Jan. 28. In doing so, he gave up efforts to court the
far-right Yisrael Beiteinu faction, which had made a series of
hard-line demands in return for a partnership.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's move came at a time when U.S. officials have been trying
to keep Israel from complicating Washington's plans for a possible
war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials hope to nudge the Sharon government toward renewed
negotiations with the Palestinians. The administration has offered a
step-by-step plan leading to the creation of a Palestinian state in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Just as in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the U.S. is seeking
commitments from Israel not to retaliate if Iraq strikes the Jewish
state with missiles or other weapons. An Israeli military response to
an Iraqi attack, U.S. officials fear, could tempt other Arab
countries to join Iraq in a broader regional war against Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said they doubt the elections will have any effect on the
peace process, which has been virtually frozen amid rounds of suicide
bombings and Israeli military responses.</TE>
<TE>   "This can't hurt a peace process that doesn't exist," said David
Makovsky of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Makovsky said he believes that Sharon will try to do all he can to
avoid disrupting the White House's war planning at this delicate
moment because the prime minister is determined to maintain his good
relationship with Bush -- and also eager to see U.S. forces oust
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Makovsky said Sharon also won't want to take any action that would
appear too radical: History shows that Israeli elections are won
"near the center of the political spectrum," Makovsky said, adding
that a drift to the right "could be electoral suicide."</TE>

<HD>Despite Apparent Success in Yemen, Risks Remain</HD>
<DH>The CIA may have killed a major Al Qaeda figure when an
unmanned plane incinerated a car, but Arab outrage could well imperil
Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Miller</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For years, the debate raged within the CIA: Should the United States
hunt down and kill its terrorist foes, or would Israeli-style
"targeted killings" only invite retribution and feed an endless cycle
of violence?</LD>
<LD>   The debate ended Sunday, current and former intelligence officials
say, when the CIA incinerated a carful of alleged Al Qaeda operatives
in northern Yemen with a laser-guided Hellfire missile.</LD>
<LD>   "There was discussion about this for years in the CIA," said one
former official of the agency who has extensive experience in the
Middle East. "The discussion is now over, and the operations have
begun."</LD>
<TE>   The risks remain. Even those who applauded Sunday's strike said in
interviews Tuesday that it is sure to inflame militant Muslims,
including those belonging to the Al Qaeda network, and expose U.S.
diplomats and other overseas officials to possible retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   The attack triggered outrage in some quarters of the Arab world
and forced U.S. officials into the difficult position of defending a
tactic Washington has criticized Israel for using.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush administration officials made it clear that they see
those risks and diplomatic discomforts as worth enduring when they
are confronted with an opportunity to kill a high-ranking Al Qaeda
figure linked to previous attacks and considered likely to be
planning more.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, U.S. officials and top Pentagon advisors said Tuesday
that Al Qaeda should expect more of the same.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got new authorities, new tools and a new willingness to do
it wherever it has to be done," one administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the CIA nor the White House would publicly confirm the
U.S. role in the strike, which is believed to have killed Qaed Sinan
Harithi, who is suspected of being involved in the 2000 bombing off
Yemen of the U.S. destroyer Cole, an attack in which 17 U.S. sailors
died.</TE>
<TE>   But administration officials openly relished what was widely
viewed as a significant and symbolic U.S. victory.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz called the strike "a
very successful tactical operation."</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to keep the pressure on everywhere we're able to," he
said on CNN. "We've got to deny the sanctuaries everywhere we're able
to, and we've got to put pressure on every government that is giving
these people support to get out of that business."</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer declined to discuss the attack
specifically but said: "The president has talked about a shadowy war
where terrorists are going to try to hide .... We're going to be on
the lookout for them when they emerge."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's mission was in keeping with the so-called Bush doctrine,
which, among other things, commits the United States to preemptive
military strikes in the American-declared war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The attack was carried out by an unmanned CIA surveillance plane
armed with laser-guided missiles. The Predator drones had been
patrolling Yemen in recent months, tracking the movements of dozens
of Al Qaeda figures who have been operating in the country's barren
northern territory.</TE>
<TE>   Until Sunday, U.S. strikes on suspected Al Qaeda members had been
confined to the war theater in Afghanistan. Elsewhere, the CIA's
activities had appeared to consist mainly of assisting in raids and
other operations conducted jointly with foreign intelligence
services.</TE>
<TE>   At the State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher refused to
discuss the attack in Yemen and trod carefully around questions of
whether U.S. involvement in the strike contradicted long-standing
U.S. disapproval of so-called targeted killings.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department has repeatedly criticized Israel for using
such tactics against Palestinians. Asked whether the United States
had altered its opinion, Boucher replied, "Our policy on targeted
killings in the Israeli-Palestinian context has not changed."</TE>
<TE>   He went on to say that the U.S. position reflects concern that
such killings harm prospects for peace negotiations. Those reasons,
he said, "do not necessarily apply in other circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli scholars rejected such distinctions and said the strike in
Yemen was tantamount to a U.S. endorsement of the Israeli policy of
preemptive attacks on militant foes. The U.S. shift, the scholars
said, shows that the Bush administration has rejected the long-held
American view that refraining from violence offers at least some
protection from retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel knows that it's going to be attacked no matter what it
does," said Barry Rubin, head of the Global Research in International
Affairs Center. "The U.S. situation has become more like the Israeli
situation. It is the impact of Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   Current and former intelligence officials said reprisals are
possible, if not inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   "Not everybody has been gung-ho about going out and doing this,"
said the former CIA official, who was previously involved in
high-level counter-terrorism missions. "It may be the right policy,
but it's not going to be without consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, said Sept. 11 showed that restraint earned
America no protection from Al Qaeda and that the show of force in
Yemen was long overdue.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they'll try to do something else to us," a former senior
CIA official said. "The fact is, we've been getting shot at for the
last 30 to 40 years. The weaker they think you are, the more they'll
go after us."</TE>
<TE>   Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said he was not aware of
whether U.S. embassies are taking extra precautions in the wake of
the missile strike but noted that they are "already at a very high
state of security."</TE>
<TE>   The attack in Yemen prompted criticism from some in the Arab
world. The London-based Arab newspaper Al Quds al Arabi carried an
editorial Tuesday condemning the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the Americans are adopting the Israeli style of
bombing -- it is appalling," editor Abdel Bari Atwan wrote. "This is
not the work of a civilized democratic power but in the style of
Osama bin Laden."</TE>
<TE>   Atwan predicted that the attack will antagonize Arabs and "will
encourage membership [in] Al Qaeda."</TE>
<TE>   The Yemeni government, which is cooperating with the United States
in the war on terrorism and is said to have permitted the attack,
offered no immediate comment on the incident. Many experts said the
strike is likely to inflame anti-American sentiment already
widespread in the country.</TE>
<TE>   But Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, issued a statement
Tuesday timed for the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan
urging Al Qaeda members to "repent" and "renounce all means of
violence."</TE>
<TE>   The official Yemeni news agency cited reports from tribesmen near
the scene of the attack, about 100 miles east of the capital, Sana,
confirming that Harithi was among those killed.</TE>
<TE>   Harithi had been under U.S. surveillance for months. A onetime
bodyguard to Bin Laden, he was believed to be Al Qaeda's operational
leader in Yemen, where many Al Qaeda members have fled from war-torn
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Some intelligence officials said the strike is certain to deliver
a psychological blow to Al Qaeda, perhaps explaining why word of U.S.
involvement in the attack leaked so quickly from the Bush White House
on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to take credit for this operation," said the former
senior CIA official. It sends a message that Al Qaeda "is not even
safe in north Yemen. That's the back of the beyond. Al Qaeda owns
that lawless border area, and I'm sure they've been wandering around
there with impunity."</TE>
<TE>   Others were skeptical that Islamic militants would be cowed even
by an impressive display of U.S. weaponry.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure you can frighten them," another former CIA operative
said. "They do crazy better than we do."</TE>
<TE>   The strike came at a time when many in the Bush administration
have been pushing for more aggressive tactics in the war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   At the Pentagon in recent weeks, Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld and others have been discussing the expanded use of special
forces in the Al Qaeda hunt.</TE>
<TE>   An influential Pentagon advisory board has advocated launching a
wave of preemptive operations targeting Al Qaeda cells, designed to
create confusion and expose them to U.S. intelligence collection.</TE>
<TE>   An American intelligence official said Sunday's strike may have
accomplished just that.</TE>
<TE>   "Events like this are worth doing for the sake of taking known
terrorists out of action," the official said. "But they can also
cause people to move or communicate or perhaps stop planning things
while they're worried about their own security."</TE>
<TE>   Some CIA veterans said the attack was in keeping with a long
tradition of ambitious clandestine operations. R. James Woolsey, CIA
director in the early 1990s, recalled the World War II era, before
the agency was created.</TE>
<TE>   "We broke the Japanese code and sent up aircraft to shoot down
Adm. Yamamoto's plane and killed him," Woolsey said. "It was a
targeted killing of one of their greatest military figures."</TE>

<LD>   Published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., the study

<LD>A man who shackled his 21-year-old daughter to a bed after she
disobeyed him and dated a married man was convicted of misdemeanor
false imprisonment Tuesday. But a judge acquitted David Mata Avila,
53, of the more serious felony imprisonment charge.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors deadlocked when it came to charges against his wife,
Guadalupe Mata, 51. Jurors voted 10 to 2 to acquit her of false
imprisonment. Prosecutors will decide today whether to retry her.</LD>
<LD>   The charges stemmed from an incident in June when the Fullerton
couple's daughter Giovana returned home from a date with a man whom
her parents had forbidden her to see. The daughter told police that
her father had hit her and then shackled her to the bed. Defense
lawyers had said that the chains were placed on the daughter in a way
that she could easily escape and that a padlock on the chain was not
locked.</LD>
<TE>   Jurors acquitted the father of a misdemeanor battery charge.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the jury found that the chains were more a symbolic
gesture than a malicious attempt to hurt the girl," defense lawyer
Patrick McNeal said.</TE>
<TE>   A misdemeanor false-imprisonment conviction can carry up to a year
in jail, but the mother and father have already spent three months in
custody, and it is unlikely the father will spend additional time in
jail. However, the couple, who have been in the country illegally for
more than 14 years, now face deportation proceedings by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service. Lawyers for them said they
would fight to remain in the U.S.</TE>

<HD>Historic Turns for Cities, 'Great Park'?</HD>
<DH>Anaheim mayoral result may be ironic, Santa Ana's council
could go majority-Latino, and an El Toro conversion windfall looks
doomed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Evan Halper and Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County voters, challenged to fill a slew of critical vacancies
in city governments, appeared Tuesday to favor a former Republican
leader as Anaheim's new mayor and were on the verge of making history
in Santa Ana by electing the city's first Latino-majority City
Council.</LD>
<LD>   California voters also appeared to deal a major setback to the
proposed "Great Park," the mammoth open space and recreational
facility at the closed El Toro Marine base, by rejecting state
Proposition 51. The ballot measure would provide $120 million for the
Great Park project.</LD>
<LD>   The opening in the Anaheim mayor's office, a vacancy created by
term limits, was enough to entice former Assembly Speaker Curt
Pringle out of political retirement, and the four-term state lawmaker
was leading comfortably in a battle with two current council members,
according to election returns late Tuesday night.</LD>
<TE>   Former Orange County Supervisor Roger Stanton's bid for political
redemption -- a low-profile race for Fountain Valley City Council --
appeared to fall short, returns showed.</TE>
<TE>   Stanton was board chairman when the county plunged into its
historic bankruptcy in 1994, and Tuesday night he was trailing three
other candidates in a race for three City Council seats. Stanton ran
on a platform of fiscal accountability. He and two other officials
faced civil misconduct charges -- later dismissed -- in the failure
to prevent the bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Ana, where 76% of the population is Latino, early returns
indicated that the voters may -- for the first time -- elect a Latino
majority on the City Council. Planner Mike Garcia was leading handily
in the race for the Ward 6 seat early Tuesday night and, if
victorious, would join Claudia C. Alvarez and Jose Solorio on the
six-member council. Santa Ana Mayor Miguel A. Pulido ran unopposed in
his bid for a third term in Orange County's largest city.</TE>
<TE>   The county's first Latina member of Congress, Rep. Loretta Sanchez
(D-Garden Grove), appeared to be a lock to win reelection, as did the
entire Orange County congressional delegation, early returns
indicate.</TE>
<TE>   The ascension of Latino candidates in Orange County and growing
power of Latino voters countywide emerged as an issue in the Anaheim
mayoral race. In 1988, Pringle and the local GOP stationed guards at
polling places in Latino neighborhoods in Santa Ana because he said
he feared Democrats were going to bus in illegal immigrants to vote.
Pringle and the party eventually settled a civil rights lawsuit for
$400,000.</TE>
<TE>   However, this year, after deciding to run for mayor, Pringle
reached out to Latino leaders in Anaheim and supported their fight to
bring a Mexican-owned Gigante supermarket to town.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, riding a wave of popular support for his
leadership in defeating a proposed airport at El Toro, was coasting
to another term in office.</TE>
<TE>   Agran assured voters during his campaign that with the airport
dead, he will deliver the Great Park that was promised for the base.</TE>
<TE>   "We asked the people to give us the opportunity to finish the job
we began together, not just to defeat the airport, but to replace it
with something better," Agran said at his election night headquarters
at the Asia Noodle Cafe in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   "By this time next year, we expect to be on the runways with
jackhammers," he said.But getting a park built is not going to be
easy, because California voters Tuesday appeared to be rejecting
state Proposition 51. The ballot measure would have made the Great
Park a priority in the state budget, shifting funding from other
programs. Opponents warned that the measure would wreak havoc on the
state budget and was packed with hundreds of millions of dollars in
goodies for developers who funded the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Incumbent Irvine Councilwoman Beth Krom, an Agran ally, also was
leading in Tuesday's balloting, but Agran's coattails may not be long
enough to sweep his entire slate of allies onto the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Former Mayor Christina Shea, a fierce critic of the mayor whose
attorney threatened to sue Agran a few weeks ago for allegedly making
false statements about her campaign platform, led slightly in her bid
to return to Irvine politics.</TE>
<TE>   The El Toro issue extended beyond Irvine on Tuesday night to a
countywide advisory initiative intended to put public pressure on the
U.S. Navy to remove all hazardous material from the base. Early
returns showed strong voter support for the measure.</TE>

<HD>Mixed Signals in School Board Race</HD>
<DH>One targeted Santa Ana trustee leads, another trails. In
Garden Grove, one candidate could make history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Yi and Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Embattled Santa Ana school board President John Palacio led in early
returns Tuesday night, while trustee Nadia Maria Davis -- who was
also targeted by a pair of well-financed challengers backed by the
city's power elite -- trailed in her bid for reelection.</LD>
<LD>   In Garden Grove, Lan Nguyen led in his bid to become the nation's
first Vietnamese American school board member, while in Anaheim,
outspoken school board member Harald G. Martin was losing his seat
with part of the vote counted.</LD>
<LD>   But voters appeared eager to finance repairs and new school
facilities with bond measures headed for victory in four Orange
County school districts.</LD>
<TE>   In the Santa Ana Unified School District, the fight for the seats
of Palacio and Davis was part of a larger struggle to wrest control
of the five-member board from the current majority that also includes
trustee Nativo Lopez. Round two is scheduled for Feb. 4, when Lopez,
serving his second term, faces a recall election.</TE>
<TE>   Former trustee Audrey Y. Noji appeared headed for a comeback,
holding onto second place in the eight-candidate race, after losing a
reelection bid in 2000. The results suggested that the overcrowded
and underachieving school district would continue to be mired in a
political battle for majority control of the board.</TE>
<TE>   "It is obviously too early to tell, but it shows the message that
we tried to share was very compelling," an optimistic Palacio said.
"That the district is moving in the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Critics say Lopez, Palacio and Davis have polarized the heavily
Latino, 62,000-student district along ethnic lines as schools
struggle with overcrowded classrooms and academic scores that are
among the lowest in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez and Palacio counter that they are being targeted for
representing working-class Latino and immigrant families at the
expense of a city establishment more interested in gentrification.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the effort to oust the three are an alliance of angry
parents, City Hall leaders and Ron Unz, the businessman behind
Proposition 227, the 1998 measure that curbed bilingual education in
the state.</TE>
<TE>   Unz and recall campaign organizers accuse Lopez of promoting
bilingual education in the district in defiance of the measure -- a
charge Lopez denies. Unz donated money and equipment to the effort to
recall Lopez and $18,000 to challengers Lupe Moreno and Oscar Garza.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Mayor Miguel A. Pulido and Councilman Brett Franklin
have backed Moreno and Garza, who both have agreed to reconsider
controversial plans for a new school in the affluent north end of the
city.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the city approved a luxury-home development for the lot
near the Santa Ana Freeway, but the school district took the land
through eminent domain for an elementary school. In 1999, the
district passed a $145-million construction bond and is expected to
start several projects, including expansions of existing campuses, in
coming months.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez and Palacio have accused north-end critics of opposing the
school because the district's students are mostly children of
working-class Latinos. Their opponents say a school isn't needed in
the area and accuse the trustees of turning the plan into an ethnic
issue.</TE>
<TE>   In Garden Grove Unified, Nguyen also was poised to become the
first minority on the board, which oversees a district in which 72%
of the students are not white.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen was leading Bob Harden and Terry Cantrell, incumbents
elected eight years ago with the support of a county organization
that sought to create a countywide network of conservative school
board members. The top two vote-getters would get seats on the
five-member board.</TE>
<TE>   "If I end up winning, it's obvious that the votes didn't just come
from the Vietnamese community," Nguyen said. "It's a call for change,
an indication that people in all sectors want to try something new."</TE>
<TE>   In nearby Anaheim Union High School District, a dozen candidates
sought three seats, including one held by Martin, who has proposed
policies aimed at keeping illegal-immigrant children out of schools.</TE>
<TE>   In the lead was incumbent Thomas "Hoagy" Holguin, appointed two
years ago and currently the only Latino on a school board where
Latinos once formed a majority.</TE>
<TE>   Other leading candidates were Robert Stewart, who resigned from
the board two years ago and wants to improve education of academic
basics, and Denise Mansfield-Reinking, a former Northern California
school board member who supports increased parental control over
district decisions.</TE>
<TE>   All four of the county's local school facilities bond measures
appeared headed for easy passage.</TE>
<TE>   The Tustin Unified School District sought $80 million for
maintenance and infrastructure improvements at its 20 oldest schools.</TE>
<TE>   The Centralia School District's $17.5-million bond measure would
fund renovations at district support facilities and at nine schools,
all built from 1955 to 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Santiago Community College District's $337-million measure
would fund nearly 30 construction and renovation projects, including
classrooms to replace trailers at Santiago Canyon College and a math
and science facility at Santa Ana College.</TE>
<TE>   Coast Community College District's measure would provide $370
million to replace and upgrade facilities at Coastline, Golden West
and Orange Coast colleges.</TE>

<LD>Let's say you're an amateur astronomer and, one night behind the
telescope, you spot an immense asteroid heading for Earth. You figure
it's your duty to tell someone about it, but then you think, "Hey,
what's in it for me?"</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to Orange County congressman Dana Rohrabacher, the answer
could be cold hard cash.</LD>
<LD>   You might think a congressman has better things to do than worry
about an asteroid striking the Earth -- or scaring the rest of us to
death by talking about it -- but you don't know our Mr. Rohrabacher.</LD>
<TE>   As always, his brain is percolating.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to know if there is a threat coming at the world," he
told Congress last month while pushing his bill to reward amateur
astronomers with cash grants for discovering asteroids or for
bolstering the country's knowledge of existing ones.</TE>
<TE>   The bill sailed through the House of Representatives. A Senate
version hasn't been introduced, but a Rohrabacher spokesman said he
expects one to be.</TE>
<TE>   Rohrabacher is a proven spotter of global threats, having earned
his conservative stripes as an outspoken anti-Communist and combative
foe of illegal immigration.</TE>
<TE>   He's been less adroit at spotting local threats, having supported
at least three public officials in recent years whose conduct drew
the district attorney's attention.</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't mean he's wrong about asteroids hitting the
Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Nor should you assume Rohrabacher is a dilettante on the subject,
given that he's the chairman of the House Space and Aeronautics
Subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   Rohrabacher told Congress that numerous asteroids and comets have
come close to Earth in recent years but went undetected until later.
"If any one of these ... would have hit the Earth, it would have been
a catastrophic occasion, perhaps killing hundreds of millions of
people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists seem split on the actual danger to Earth.</TE>
<TE>   They acknowledge that asteroids are out there, perhaps with
potential to do damage, but there doesn't seem to be agreement on how
realistic that threat is.</TE>
<TE>   Rohrabacher says one scientist told him the chances are no greater
than that of going to Las Vegas and landing a royal flush in poker.</TE>
<TE>   Rohrabacher says he once got a royal flush.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the seven-term congressman isn't prepared to break the bank
over asteroids.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps reflecting his fiscal conservatism, Rohrabacher's bill
would award only $10,000 to astronomers in each of the next two
years.</TE>
<TE>   Ten grand to thwart the Earth's annihilation? Yeah, I'd spring for
that.</TE>
<TE>   Rohrabacher wants to name the award after Charles "Pete" Conrad, a
former astronaut and the third man to walk on the moon. Conrad was a
Huntington Beach resident who died after a motorcycle accident in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   His bill, Rohrabacher says, just might get young Americans excited
about science. "Let us get them off of these electronic games," he
told Congress, "and get them into the real world, and the real world
may well be dealing with threats coming to us from outer space from
great distances away."</TE>
<TE>   The whole idea behind identifying asteroids, he says, is "Home
Planet Defense."</TE>
<TE>   "We need to pay some attention to it; and then if an asteroid does
threaten us, we will be able to identify it far in advance and deter
it from its path so it would not hurt the people of the world."</TE>
<TE>   Home Planet Defense. Rohrabacher supports it, and so do I.</TE>
<TE>   Is there any wonder why the congressman easily won reelection
Tuesday?</TE>

<HD>Teenagers Form Link From Koran to U.S.</HD>
<DH>The growing number of youths reciting prayers during
Ramadan signals the emergence of a generation of American- born
leadership.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Lobdell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Each evening for a month, a handful of teenage boys across Southern
California will recite from memory a chapter of the Koran -- Islam's
holy book -- to crowds gathered at mosques. Just one of these evening
prayers can take up to 90 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   By the end of the 30 days of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month that
began at sundown Tuesday, the boys will have chanted in ancient
Arabic all 6,391 verses of the Koran.</LD>
<LD>   This doesn't just mark an impressive feat of mental agility, local
Muslim leaders say. It also signals the emergence of the next
generation of Islamic leadership in America: native-born Muslims who
are devout enough to spend years committing the Koran to memory but
who are also able to blend in easily with the local culture.</LD>
<TE>   Outside the Islamic Society of Orange County mosque in Garden
Grove last week, Nasir Jiwa, 17, looked like any other U.S. teenager.
Dressed in jeans and a long-sleeve shirt, he rode a scooter and joked
with friends.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, Nasir will be leading prayers at the Islamic Society of
Fountain Valley mosque.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the next generation," said Nasir, a student at Orange
Coast College who said he started to memorize the Koran five years
ago. "I feel like this is my country and this is my religion. Of
course, I feel a sense of responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Ramadan marks the revelation of the Koran to the prophet Muhammad.
During the monthlong observance, Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset,
say additional daily prayers, give to charity and, on the last and
holiest day, celebrate Eid al-Fitr, or Feast of the Fast-Breaking.</TE>
<TE>   There are no statistics on how many Muslim teenagers in the United
States have memorized the Koran in recent years, an achievement
Islamic experts say is accomplished by only about 1% of the followers
of Islam. But local officials estimate about two dozen Southern
California teenagers can recite the holy book by heart, making them
eligible to say the extended prayers of Ramadan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very heartwarming to see Muslims born and raised in America
become part of the leadership and taking us into new directions,"
said Sabiha Kahn, a spokeswoman for the Southern California chapter
of the Council for American-Islamic Relations.</TE>
<TE>   For Muneeb Baig, 16, this will be his fourth year of leading
prayers at the Garden Grove mosque. He finished memorizing the Koran
at age 13, after three years and four to five hours a day of study.
In preparation for Ramadan, he has reviewed the text for up to 90
minutes each day. This kind of religious devotion led to a decision
by him and his family to attend school at home, freeing up time for
further Islamic studies.</TE>
<TE>   "I memorized the Koran, but I haven't become a scholar of the
religion yet," said the soft-spoken Muneeb.</TE>
<TE>   Faiz Dadabhoy, 17, of Diamond Bar said he was moved to memorize
the Koran after hearing a younger Muslim lead Ramadan prayers three
years ago and envisioning himself in that role.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty motivated by it," said Faiz, who will recite the
Koran during Ramadan at the Islamic Center of San Gabriel Valley in
Walnut. "It's good to have people born in the community [lead
prayers]. They know English better, and they know the culture
better."</TE>
<TE>   All the teenagers are quick to underscore their respect of the
elder leaders of the mosques. Most are immigrants who memorized the
Koran in their homelands. But they agree that their generation's
advantage is that it can better integrate a U.S. minority religion
into the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   The young leaders also can relate to the special problems young
Muslims face in this society -- including prejudice, fashion
challenges and dating.</TE>
<TE>   "Young kids have people to identify with," Kahn said. "They are
people who went through the same things as us and rose above it all"
to remain true to their Islamic values.</TE>

<TE>   Ramadan</TE>
<TE>   Ramadan is the Muslim holy month that celebrates the revelation of
the Koran, Islam's holy book, to the prophet Muhammad. The month is
devoted to sacrifice, community, introspection and charity. The
Ramadan fast -- sawm -- during which adults abstain from eating and
drinking during the day, is one of the five pillars, or basic duties,
of Islam. The other pillars are the shahada, or profession of faith;
the salat, or formal prayer; the zakat, a tithing for charity; and
the hajj, a pilgrimage to Mecca.</TE>

<HD>Defects Found in Freeway Bridge</HD>
<DH>Broken-off concrete may delay completion of the carpool
ramp linking the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways. It's in no danger
of collapse, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Construction defects may delay the opening -- and possibly require
the rebuilding -- of a $12-million carpool lane connector at the busy
interchange of the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County transportation officials said Tuesday that they are
investigating structural defects recently discovered in portions of
the two-way, half-mile ramp between the freeways.</LD>
<LD>   Although experts said the bridge is in no danger of collapsing,
patches of broken-off concrete raise questions about the connector's
ability to carry heavy traffic.</LD>
<TE>   Repair work could involve as little as redoing sections of
concrete or, in the worst case, rebuilding the 60-foot-high flyover
at a cost of millions of dollars and a delay of eight months.</TE>
<TE>   The ramp near John Wayne Airport was scheduled to open in April.</TE>
<TE>   But officials said the defects could postpone that until the end
of next year, at the latest.</TE>
<TE>   "We are now assessing what the problems are and how to fix them,"
said Rick Grebner, an engineer and project manager for the Orange
County Transportation Authority. "If left as it is, it won't carry
the traffic it was designed for. There is a problem of long-term
durability."</TE>
<TE>   The carpool connector between the 405 and 55 is part of a
$125-million project to relieve congestion on one of the nation's
busiest highway interchanges. Drivers make about 433,000 trips a day
through the area.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA is funding the project through Measure M, the local sales tax
used for transportation projects. Caltrans is overseeing construction
of an array of connectors and offramps, including ones at Bristol
Street and Avenue of the Arts in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   The entire project, which is being built by C.C. Myers Inc. of
Rancho Cordova, Calif., is scheduled to be finished in 2004, about
five years after construction began.</TE>
<TE>   Pam Gorniak, a spokeswoman for the California Department of
Transportation, said Tuesday that it was premature for the agency to
issue any statements about the cause of the problems or who was
responsible. A complete assessment is due in about two months.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is speculation at this point," Gorniak said. "We need
more data on this. There is nothing conclusive yet."</TE>
<TE>   Work was halted on the connector about two months ago when
construction crews found that surface layers of concrete were falling
off supporting walls under the roadway. The unusual condition is
known as spawling.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the investigation has found that spawling has affected
about 5% of the concrete that covers the bridge's reinforcing steel
along the walls of the road's inside curve.</TE>
<TE>   Although the assessment is not finished, Grebner said the concrete
might have fallen off when construction crews, using hydraulic
machinery, applied tension to reinforcing cables that run through the
ramp.</TE>
<TE>   The tension, designed to strengthen the structure, could have
caused the cables to move unexpectedly, popping off the concrete.</TE>
<TE>   "The bridge is not moving or creeping," Grebner said. "No new
damage has been found, but the study is still underway."</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials said the bridge is seismically safe, but traffic
will not be allowed on it until the structure is declared sound. The
problems, they added, will not affect other parts of the interchange
project.</TE>
<TE>   "What they are trying to do is very appropriate," said Masanobu
Shinozuka, chairman of UC Irvine's department of civil and
environmental engineering. "Everyone concerned is involved, and they
are not trying to hide anything. This is good."</TE>
<TE>   Shinozuka said spawling is an unusual condition that can be caused
by a variety of factors, including design, poor quality control and
environmental conditions such as heat or cold.</TE>
<TE>   Grebner said investigators are looking into whether the tight
curve of the connector had anything to do with the failing concrete.</TE>
<TE>   How much the repairs will cost is still unknown, Grebner said. If
there are construction-related problems, for example, Caltrans or the
construction company might be responsible for additional expenses.</TE>

<HD>Saddleback OKd for Development</HD>
<DH>O.C. supervisors approve 283 homes on ranchland that
developers have fought for since the 1970s. Foes vow a court
challenge.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Capping 24 years of bitter disputes, the Orange County Board of
Supervisors took less than an hour Tuesday to approve development of
Saddleback Meadows, a historic ranching site at the doorstep of the
Cleveland National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   On a 3-1 vote, with Supervisor Jim Silva recusing himself, the
board approved construction of 283 single-family homes on the
230-acre site, with 70% set aside as open space.</LD>
<LD>   "At some point in time, a private property owner has the right to
reasonably develop private property.... Today is the day, in my
opinion," said Supervisor Todd Spitzer, whose district includes the
site nestled between two monasteries and other housing developments
off El Toro and Live Oak Canyon roads at the county's rural eastern
edge.</LD>
<TE>   "We're elated," said Frank Elfend, an Orange County-based
consultant who has represented would-be developers of Saddleback
Meadows since 1994, including the current owner, California Quartet
of Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   A last-minute condition was tucked into the approvals, requiring
$25 million in insurance and a 100% performance liability bond
against possible damage to St. Michael's Abbey and other neighbors
because of grading that will be required to stabilize the steep,
landslide-prone site.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents criticized the decision and vowed to file a legal appeal
within 30 days. They contend that water-quality concerns and an
environmentally superior alternative allowing construction of a
smaller number of homes had been ignored.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a fraud and a deceit," said Ed Connor, an attorney
representing the Hindu-affiliated Ramakrishna Monastery. "It is a
continuing mystery to me why the county feels so beholden to an
absentee owner we have never seen."</TE>
<TE>   Connor said the vote could result in the county losing 240 acres
of parkland that had been deeded to O'Neill Regional Park by the
Vedanta Society of Southern California, which runs the monastery. He
said a condition of the gift was that the monastery not be disturbed
by development.</TE>
<TE>   "I swear to you ... we will take that land back," Connor told the
board before the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Murphy, spokesman for the county planning and development
services department, said that "if that's the move he wishes to make,
that's his prerogative.... Let's wait till things calm down and see
what happens."</TE>
<TE>   The vote came at the end of an uncharacteristically brief public
hearing, given the years of contentious debate over the project. Just
four opponents spoke, in contrast to past meetings when dozens packed
hearing rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer led Tuesday's vote, joined by Supervisors Cynthia P. Coad
and Charles Smith. Supervisor Tom Wilson voted against it, citing
continuing concerns over polluted storm water runoff into Aliso Creek
and other environmental issues. Silva left before the public hearing
began, citing "a perceived conflict of interest."</TE>
<TE>   One Official Abstained</TE>
<TE>   Silva has regularly abstained from votes on the project since
Aradi Inc., a former owner of the site that has the same managing
partner as California Quartet, was fined $14,000 for allegedly
laundering political contributions to Silva through its employees.</TE>
<TE>   The company did not admit guilt, but paid the fines. Silva was not
charged with wrongdoing and has never been barred from voting on the
project.</TE>
<TE>   Developers have fought since the 1970s to build on Saddleback
Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   One previous owner went bankrupt, and negotiations to buy the land
as open space fell apart amid finger-pointing.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer alluded to those negotiations Tuesday, saying his first
choice would have been to have the land preserved, but that he had
been "frustrated" when good-faith efforts by the landowner had been
repeatedly rejected by opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Connor said it was the developer that walked away from an
agreed-upon deal that would have given the company $5.2 million in
private and public funds and allowed construction of 70 homes on 44
acres of stable ridge land.</TE>
<TE>   He said that after agreeing to the proposal, the developer
suddenly said about 75 acres would need to be graded, destroying
mature live oaks, pristine canyons and other unique biological
resources.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Ramakrishna monks also would have been forced to look
at a 5-foot-high concrete wall.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Grange, a spokesman for California Quartet, said Connor's
account of  the failed negotiations was "very disingenuous."</TE>
<TE>   "[Connor's] reason for not coming up with the money is because you
will have to grade an area larger than the specific homes. Well,
that's true for every home.... You have to pick up dirt beyond the
specific parameters of where the homes would actually go; you have to
do land stabilization," Grange said. "As for the issue concerning the
concrete wall, I have no idea what he's talking about."</TE>
<TE>   Connor said county officials have ignored a lower-density proposal
that would net the developer up to $20 million, while leaving intact
huge stands of trees, vernal pools that are home to half of the
county's endangered Riverside fairy shrimp population, and pristine
canyons.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer and Grange said that the alternative had been considered
but was rejected as unfeasible.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to lawyers for the monasteries, longtime area
residents pleaded with supervisors not to approve the development,
saying it would wreck the rural ambience.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten years from now, when you look out over the 120-foot-high
manufactured slopes required to build these homes ... I wonder if you
will feel you have preserved the rural character of the area," said
Ray Chandos, a longtime Trabuco Canyon resident.</TE>
<TE>   Federal and state regulators have consistently voiced opposition
to the development, saying it would destroy a crucial wildlife
corridor between the county's central coast and proposed nature
preserves in South County.</TE>

<HD>Problems Few -- Just Like Voters</HD>
<DH>An estimated 30% of the electorate casts ballots, about
half the rate of four years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County elections officials reported few problems Tuesday as
voters turned out in low numbers to decide a variety of races and
measures that nonetheless failed to ignite much interest.</LD>
<LD>   Only about 30% of voters had cast ballots, according to
preliminary calculations. The turnout was well below voting activity
four years ago, when 61% of Orange County voters went to the polls.</LD>
<LD>   "People only show up and vote when they want to, and this time I
guess they didn't feel like they wanted to," said Steve Rodermund,
deputy chief registrar for Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   The only major problem occurred in Irvine. A handful of voters
were kept from casting ballots at 9 a.m. at a gated community in the
Northpark neighborhood after security guards blocked them from
entering.</TE>
<TE>   One of the voters called the registrar's office to complain.
Rodermund said he sent an inspector and immediately called the
homeowners association. Irvine's city clerk also came out to check.
The matter was resolved within 10 minutes, he said. The homeowners
association had approved the polling place but had failed to notify
the guards. Polling places by law must be open to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "Like with anything else, sometimes the right hand doesn't know
what the left hand is doing," Rodermund said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the county's 1,732 polling places, only a few are within gated
communities, he said. Tuesday's was the only instance of voters being
kept from entering a gated neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   In another incident, the opening of a polling place in Irvine was
delayed after an inspector overslept. The polling place was opened at
7:15 a.m. after the tardy worker arrived and was sent home.</TE>
<TE>   In other precincts around the county, poll workers and voters said
they experienced only minor glitches, including language
difficulties, missing names on rosters and occasional long waits.
Many emphasized the need for more bilingual poll workers and better
organization and outreach.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been interesting," said Westminster precinct inspector
Barbara Branch, who spent much of her time gesturing to first-time
Vietnamese voters who spoke little if any English. In a precinct
where more than half the voters are Vietnamese, Branch said, only one
worker could speak both Vietnamese and English.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't turn anyone away. But it got frustrating for some.
Fortunately, the people who came to vote really wanted to vote and
were excited to vote. So by the end of the process, everyone is
happy."</TE>
<TE>   A few miles away in Santa Ana, polling worker Joanna Qiao said she
was relieved to have three additional poll workers at the Santa Ana
Senior Center, which remained busy all day. In past elections, she
handled the job solo.</TE>
<TE>   "Very smooth. No problems. This year, it's very busy," said Qiao.
A larger stipend for poll workers helped, especially with bilingual
workers, she said. The center had workers who spoke Tagalog,
Vietnamese and Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   But things were not perfect.</TE>
<TE>   "We were still overwhelmed," said Efren Gomez, a precinct
inspector in Santa Ana. "We had one poll worker, who was supposed to
be fluent in Spanish, who didn't show up."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday was the last time most Orange County voters will use the
county's older punch-ballot system. The Board of Supervisors in
December will choose a new electronic voting system.</TE>

<HD>Tiger Woods Donates $5 Million to Lead Drive for Learning
Center</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tiger Woods has given $5 million toward the launch of a $25-million
fund-raising drive to build his first Tiger Woods Learning Center at
the H.G. "Dad" Miller Golf Course in Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   "Growing up in Orange County and playing golf at Dad Miller
definitely helped shape my development as an athlete and a person,"
Woods said in a statement released Tuesday. "I think the learning
center will provide many children with opportunities that they would
not have had otherwise."</LD>
<LD>   The Learning Center project includes a 30,000-square-foot
education building for computer courses and academic tutoring, plus a
23-acre golf teaching area. The golf facilities include a putting
course and 10-acre par-3 course.</LD>
<TE>   The center will offer its services free for children 8 to 17 years
old.</TE>
<TE>   The center is envisioned as the first of several around the
country to be built by the Tiger Woods Foundation, which is run by
Woods' father, Earl.</TE>
<TE>   Several locations were considered, including Long Beach. Golf
architect Tom Fazio is designing the playing facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Building the center in Orange County was viewed as a coup by local
officials hoping to draw from Woods' prominence as one of the world's
leading athletes. As a standout student at Anaheim's Western High
School, he played the Dad Miller course in the early 1990s. He now
lives in Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "For a world-renowned local athlete to be inspired to locate this
prestigious facility in the neighborhood of his youth is a
heartwarming story of gratitude," said Orange County Supervisor
Cynthia Coad, the project's chief supporter.</TE>
<TE>   Coad pushed for the Woods foundation to take over a portion of the
Dad Miller complex, which is owned by the Orange County Flood Control
District and was leased to Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the deal, the county will spend $1 million from state
park money for improvements to a nearby area planned for a
flood-control catch basin.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim officials hope to revitalize the area around the learning
center with parks, median landscaping and a community center.</TE>
<TE>   The driving range at Dad Miller will be moved to accommodate the
center.</TE>

<HD>Sharon Calls for an Early Israeli Vote</HD>
<DH>The premier's decision comes after he is unable to mend a
coalition the Labor Party abandoned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, unable to shore up his battered
government, on Tuesday called early national elections, even as he
acknowledged that a possible U.S. war with Iraq and a deadly
stalemate with the Palestinians make this a perilous time for Israel
to embark on a turbulent political campaign.</LD>
<LD>   "Elections are the last thing this country needs right now," a
somber-faced Sharon, flanked by blue-and-white Israeli flags, told a
news conference at the prime minister's office after notifying
President Moshe Katsav of his intention to dissolve the 120-seat
Knesset, or parliament.</LD>
<LD>   The election date, still to be ratified by parliamentary
committees, was set for Jan. 28, nearly 10 months ahead of schedule,
but it could be later than that.</LD>
<TE>   The calling of early elections was the culmination of a chain of
events that began last week when the left-of-center Labor Party broke
its alliance with Sharon's conservative Likud Party, stripping his
coalition of its comfortable parliamentary majority. Sharon spent
several days trying to patch together a new, narrower coalition --
and even has joined forces with a frequent rival, former Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- but would-be parliamentary partners
imposed what he described as unacceptable conditions that would have
pushed the government much further to the right.</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister had courted the far-right Yisrael Beiteinu
faction, which has seven Knesset seats, enough to again cement a
majority for Sharon. But the party publicly made a series of
hard-line demands, including the formal rescinding of the 1993 Oslo
peace accords and the rejection of a U.S.-authored "road map" for
restarting negotiations with the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not change the basic guidelines of this government,"
Sharon said, without specifying which of the party's conditions had
made an accord impossible. "I will not undermine our strategic
understandings with the United States. I will not endanger the
special relationship which my government formed with the White
House."</TE>
<TE>   Some political observers suggested that speedy elections were
better than waiting for a vote in the spring, a timetable initially
floated after the coalition's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "The country will be cast into chaos, but at least it will be
shorter-lived chaos," said Yitzhak Herzog, who served as Cabinet
secretary under Labor Prime Minister Ehud Barak.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, a three-month time frame could very well encompass
hostilities in Iraq -- a conflict that the Bush administration very
much hopes to keep Israel clear of. Sharon himself was tight-lipped
about any scenario involving war breaking out while Israel is in the
heat of an election campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I really suggest that we speak very little about this topic," he
told reporters. "I only wish to say one thing: Israel has adopted
every single step in order to ensure that its citizens will be safe."</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of his troubled alliance with Labor, Sharon entered
into a partnership even more fraught with conflict and contradiction:
with Netanyahu, who over many years in Israel's rough-and-tumble
political scene has been both Sharon's ally and his nemesis.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever the two have worked together in government, they have
tangled publicly; whichever of them is out of power tends to harry
the one holding it.</TE>
<TE>   When Sharon served as foreign minister during Netanyahu's 1996-99
term as prime minister, for example, the ex-general repeatedly
trumpeted the fact that he had refused to shake the hand of
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat -- this at a time when
Netanyahu was trying to put the best face on peace efforts being
brokered by the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Sharon invited Netanyahu to join his Cabinet as foreign
minister, and Netanyahu -- after making early elections a
precondition for doing so -- accepted the job Tuesday, hours after
Sharon's announcement. He is to be sworn in this morning.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in a most difficult security situation, and we also know
that we are on the eve of a war in Iraq, and since the prime minister
has done the right thing by pursuing early elections, I ... am
willing to undertake the national and personal responsibility of
serving as foreign minister in his outgoing government," Netanyahu
told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   But even as he agreed to become part of Sharon's caretaker
Cabinet, Netanyahu expressed a trademark cool confidence that he, not
Sharon, will be the one to carry the Likud standard into the January
elections. He intends to challenge Sharon in primaries later this
month.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think -- hope, believe -- that I will receive the confidence
of Likud Party members to lead," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Party, now the leader of the opposition, will have its
own leadership contest in two weeks. Former Defense Minister Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer, who led the Labor exodus from the government last week,
is facing strong challenges from former Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna and
veteran lawmaker Haim Ramon.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the Labor ranks were angered by Ben-Eliezer's walkout from
Sharon's government, believing him to have been motivated more by a
desire to position himself in the party leadership race than by the
stated reason, a dispute over funding for Jewish settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Labor wanted about $145 million that was
earmarked for settlements to be diverted to social spending.</TE>
<TE>   At his news conference Tuesday, Sharon took a slap at Ben-Eliezer,
calling the Labor decision to abandon the coalition a "political
caprice." Ben-Eliezer, in turn -- alluding to the battle over the
budget -- declared that Sharon had "contempt for the poor."</TE>
<TE>   The sharp exchange signaled the early emergence of what analysts
said could be a key campaign theme: Labor seeking to stress the
economy and social issues while Likud tries to keep the spotlight on
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the region's worst outbreak of
violence in a generation, now in its third bloody year.</TE>
<TE>   Amid mounting casualties on the Israeli side -- a toll propelled
steadily upward by suicide attacks carried out by Palestinian
militants, such as one Monday that killed two Israelis in a shopping
mall outside Tel Aviv and wounded more than a dozen others -- the
same Israeli public that overwhelmingly elected Barak in 1999 with a
mandate to make peace now largely supports Sharon's unrelenting
stance toward the Palestinians. Polls have consistently given Likud a
substantial edge over Labor.</TE>
<TE>   During Sharon's time in office, Israel has militarily reoccupied
most of the West Bank's major cities, used battlefield weaponry in
crowded civilian areas, rounded up and detained thousands of
Palestinian men, and staged a campaign of targeted killings of known
militants -- all actions strongly criticized by human rights groups
but viewed by many Israelis as ugly tactics for an ugly war.</TE>
<TE>   Within Likud, some policy splits over the Palestinians are already
apparent. Netanyahu has called for exiling Arafat and dismantling the
Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, during his partnership with Labor, has denounced Arafat as
an architect of terror and refused to have any dealings with him but
has stopped short of expelling him from the Palestinian territories.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians have said they consider Israeli electoral
politics to be an internal Israeli affair but have made no secret of
the fact that they consider Sharon's government a destructive
failure.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last two years, we have seen time wasted ... and a
deepening of the conflict," senior Arafat aide Saeb Erekat said
Tuesday. "We really hope that the Israeli people this time will
choose a government capable of delivering peace in the region."</TE>

<HD>Compromise Reported on Iraq Resolution at U.N.</HD>
<DH>Gaps have been closed, U.S. says, but the French are
awaiting President Chirac's blessing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>UNITED NATIONS -- After nearly two months of wrangling, the United
States said it reached agreement with France on key provisions in an
Iraq resolution and would present a third and final draft to the
Security Council today.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials said they were pushing for a vote by Friday and
hoped that nearly all of the council's 15 members would agree with
their "core demands": that weapons inspections must be more
effective, and that if Iraq does not cooperate, it will face "serious
consequences" -- probably a military attack.</LD>
<LD>   French officials said they would reserve their assessment until
President Jacques Chirac had a chance to review the entire text, not
just the paragraphs that have been under debate.</LD>
<TE>   Though still a work in progress, a draft resolution obtained by
The Times on Tuesday evening appears to address some of the concerns
raised by France, Russia and other members by giving the Security
Council the authority to decide whether military force against Iraq
is justified. It does not say that the U.S. must wait for a council
decision to strike.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a masterpiece of creative ambiguity," said a council
diplomat who requested anonymity because not all the council members
had seen the revised text. "It delineates what it needs to, but more
important is what it doesn't say."</TE>
<TE>   France's main concern has been the "trigger" for force: how to
determine whether Iraq has violated the terms of weapons inspections,
and who shall decide what the consequences should be. France and
others have wanted to ensure that the U.S. would not decide on its
own to bomb Iraq after passing the resolution and then say it was
done with the approval of the Security Council. France, Russia,
Mexico and others are adamant that only the council can declare Iraq
in "material breach" of the resolution and authorize a punitive
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Although diplomats exchanged variations on wording for days to try
to capture the precise legal terminology, they agreed in the end to
rely on a few tweaks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Final Opportunity'</TE>
<TE>   The draft resolution declares that "Iraq has been and remains in
material breach" of past U.N. resolutions requiring it to disarm, but
it gives Baghdad "a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament
obligations." Weapons inspectors would report any failures to
cooperate or comply with the terms of the new resolution to the
Security Council, which would then decide on the consequences.</TE>
<TE>   After a day of phone calls to British, French and Russian foreign
ministers, U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and his French
counterpart, Dominique de Villepin, reached a last-minute
understanding on key sticking points Tuesday evening.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a very healthy dose of good, solid diplomacy, backed up
by a clear understanding that President Bush was determined to take
action if the United Nations did not, and that he would do so in a
multilateral way," White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer told
reporters on Air Force One earlier Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   But Russia remains a wild card. If Moscow does not accept the
U.S.-French compromise, it could pull the French away from the U.S.,
bringing others along. In the vote on a 1999 resolution creating the
new weapons inspection regime, Russia decided to abstain, and France,
China and Malaysia followed at the last minute. The division in the
council undermined the strength of the message to Baghdad, and Iraq's
allies began to defy the U.N.'s sanctions regime.</TE>
<TE>   Though U.S. officials say that a few abstentions may be the price
for a resolution tough enough to be successful, they would still like
to have a show of unity on the council.</TE>
<TE>   But even after weeks of talks, questions remain. What constitutes
a material breach? Leaving something off the list of declared
materiel? Stalling inspectors?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No Delays</TE>
<TE>   National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice has said that even a
two-hour delay of inspectors must be considered a violation, because
it would allow sufficient time to hide evidence or destroy documents,
as Iraqi officials have done in the past. Other council members,
though, might not be willing to go to war over an incomplete list.</TE>
<TE>   "If these questions go unresolved, France and Russia might reject
the resolution," a council diplomat said. "If the United States
demands the opportunity to use force if it chooses to, the Russians
will have great difficulty dealing with that."</TE>
<TE>   The resolution requires that Iraq declare its entire arsenal of
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons materiel within 30 days,
including items that have other industrial uses. It still includes a
controversial provision to take Iraqi weapons experts and their
families out of the country for interviews to avoid intimidation by
the Iraqi government. But U.N. chief weapons inspector Hans Blix has
questioned the measure's practicality -- how many family members and
colleagues would the U.N. need to take for each expert, and once they
left, would they face even more harassment upon their return? Or
would they automatically become refugees?</TE>
<TE>   On the recommendation of Blix and Mohammed Baradei of the
International Atomic Energy Agency, the draft drops two other U.S.
proposals on inspections. One would have allowed any of the five
permanent Security Council members to send their own experts on
inspection teams. The other called for armed guards to accompany
inspectors to sites. The draft still calls for security forces for
the inspectors' facilities.</TE>

<HD>SEC Chairman Quits Under Fire</HD>
<DH>Harvey Pitt's term was marked by political gaffes, the
latest with a key appointment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton and Edwin Chen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harvey L. Pitt, the beleaguered chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, resigned under pressure late Tuesday after his
latest misstep left the White House embarrassed and unwilling to
fight for his future as Wall Street's chief regulator.</LD>
<LD>   Fifteen months after his appointment, Pitt submitted a
four-paragraph resignation letter to President Bush in which he said
the controversy surrounding him was blunting the SEC's efforts to
restore investors' faith in financial markets.</LD>
<LD>   "Unfortunately, the turmoil surrounding my chairmanship and the
agency makes it very difficult for the commissioners and dedicated
SEC staffers to perform their critical assignments. Rather than be a
burden to you or the agency, I feel it is in everyone's best interest
if I step aside now," Pitt wrote.</LD>
<TE>   His resignation ends a term marked by repeated gaffes and
controversies in a year when public trust in markets has been shaken
by a steep slide in stock prices, widespread allegations of Wall
Street misconduct and massive accounting scandals.</TE>
<TE>   But the decision by the former star securities lawyer to depart
also creates new complications for the SEC and the Bush
administration. The agency faces a huge workload in negotiating Wall
Street reforms and implementing corporate governance changes mandated
by Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever the next chairman is has got a lot of work ahead of
them," said Lynn Turner, a former SEC chief accountant.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it is unclear how quickly a new chairman can be named by
President Bush and confirmed by the Senate, given partisan politics
that Pitt helped inflame in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Washington sources have suggested several possible successors to
Pitt. Among them: James Doty, a former SEC general counsel; and
Michael Chertoff, an assistant attorney general at the Justice
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt sparked a firestorm last week after it was revealed that he
did not share with the four other SEC commissioners potentially
damaging information about William H. Webster, whom Pitt had
championed to be chairman of a new accounting industry oversight
board.</TE>
<TE>   Webster, a former federal judge, had served as a director of a
small Washington-based company that had a run-in with its accounting
firm and has been sued by shareholders on allegations of fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Webster told Pitt about the issues before the SEC voted on
Webster's appointment Oct. 25. But Pitt did not inform the other SEC
commissioners. Webster was confirmed in a 3-2 vote, with the
Republican majority in favor and the two Democrats against.</TE>
<TE>   When the four other commissioners learned that Pitt had not shared
the information about Webster, they demanded an investigation.
Meanwhile, key Democrats in Congress called for Pitt's resignation,
saying he had withheld potentially critical facts about Webster.</TE>
<TE>   A Pitt spokeswoman last week said that Pitt asked the SEC staff to
investigate Webster and that the staff found "nothing of concern."
But that didn't help Pitt's standing with critics.</TE>
<TE>   The White House, especially Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr.,
also was aggravated because Pitt failed to share the information with
Card, who had favored Webster's appointment.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps sensing the inevitable, Pitt's staff sent indications to
the White House several days ago that he was "strongly considering"
stepping down, a White House official said Tuesday night. The White
House made no attempt to dissuade Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   Late Tuesday, Pitt informed the White House personnel office that
he had decided to step down and then sent a letter of resignation to
Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt, considered a brilliant lawyer, began his career at the SEC
in 1968. He rose to become general counsel of the agency by the late
1970s.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s Pitt became one of the nation's highest-profile
corporate lawyers, working for a long list of major companies,
including securities firms and accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   When Bush named him to head the SEC 15 months ago, it was the
culmination of Pitt's long-held dream to return as agency chief. He
won plaudits early on for helping the markets reopen after the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks .</TE>
<TE>   But from the start Pitt, 57, was dogged by charges that he was too
close to the securities and accounting industries.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Pitt met privately with executives of major
accounting firms. The meetings raised concerns that Pitt was
considering preferential treatment for the firms, even as public
outrage was growing over accounting scandals at companies such as
Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Pitt irritated the White House by seeking to elevate
the SEC chairmanship to Cabinet status and raise the position's
salary. His campaign met with derision among congressional Democrats
and blank stares from Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Many said Pitt's political tin ear was especially surprising given
that he was a Washington veteran.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC implemented several potentially important reforms during
Pitt's tenure and opened a record number of enforcement cases. Among
Pitt's initiatives was one forcing companies to release financial
information more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt was in a tough position, some experts said, because Bush did
not favor the aggressive corporate reforms pushed by Democrats. Yet
many of Pitt's friends and critics alike say that given the wave of
financial scandals this year, he missed the enormous political
opening to drive long-lasting reforms that would have been his
legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad that somebody who is basically honest and worked to
serve the public was unable, through ineptitude or lack of political
savvy, to do the job," said Stephen Bainbridge, a UCLA securities law
professor.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just not a bad guy. He just wasn't the right guy for this
job."</TE>

<HD>Davis Narrowly Defeats Simon; L.A. Breakup Fails</HD>
<DH>Governor's race is closer than expected amid voter
discontent. Democrats keep three other statewide offices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Z. Barabak</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Democratic Gov. Gray Davis inched past Republican Bill Simon Jr. on
Tuesday to win a grudging second term amid a wave of discontent that
kept voters home and gave minor parties their best showing in years.</LD>
<LD>   His surprisingly narrow victory capped a gnawing night that saw
the lead trade hands several times as the candidates hunkered out of
sight with their families and strategists, nervously watching
television and poring over election returns.</LD>
<LD>   Davis, part of a potential Democratic sweep of statewide offices,
finally emerged close to midnight. At just about the same time, Simon
was conceding at his headquarters hotel across town.</LD>
<TE>   To cheers of "four more years," Davis thanked his supporters and
extended a hand to Simon, asking for a round of applause from his own
partisans. "I want to thank all of California," the 59-year-old
governor said. "I thank them for the opportunity to finish the job.</TE>
<TE>   "I promise you to work as hard as I can," Davis said, looking more
relieved than exultant. He added that it had been a long election
day.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, accompanied by his wife, conceded before a crowd of
dispirited supporters. "It doesn't look like the numbers are going to
be quite there for us this time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to continue to devote myself and I know that Cindy feels
the same way," said the 51-year-old Los Angeles businessman, who
stumbled through his first run for public office. "To helping this
great Golden State search out avenues that maybe we might be of
service in the coming years."</TE>
<TE>   Three Democratic incumbents--Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, Atty. Gen.
Bill Lockyer and Treasurer Phil Angelides--appeared to retain their
seats as a Republican wave that swept the country stopped short of
the California border.</TE>
<TE>   Each tallied more votes than the governor, a slap at Davis and a
reversal of the usual trend that sees a falloff as voters work their
way down the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats Kevin Shelley and John Garamendi were leading in
contests for secretary of state and insurance commissioner. The lone
Republican preventing a Democratic sweep was Tom McClintock, who was
running neck and neck with Steve Westly in the race for state
controller.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the recession, California voters appeared to be in
generous spirits. They approved statewide ballot measures to fix the
state's crumbling public schools and address some of California's
pressing water needs.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 49, an effort by actor Arnold Schwarzenegger to
promote after-school programs, won easy passage.</TE>
<TE>   An initiative to allow voters to register at the polls on election
day was losing. Also headed for defeat was a measure to shift a
portion of the state motor vehicle tax to pay for transportation
projects.In the state's most closely watched congressional race,
Democratic Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza of Atwater opened a substantial
lead over state Sen. Dick Monteith of Modesto in his bid to replace
scandal-scarred Rep. Gary Condit (D-Ceres).</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, attorney and Democratic labor leader Linda T. Sanchez
was poised to make history by winning a newly drawn congressional
seat in southeast Los Angeles County. She was leading in early
returns and stands to join Loretta Sanchez, a Garden Grove Democrat,
as the first sister team ever to serve in the House.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats maintained their substantial advantage in the state
Legislature, even with the loss of at least two Assembly seats.</TE>
<TE>   But the party looked to be thwarted in its effort to pick up a
state Senate seat that would have given it a supermajority of 26 in
Sacramento's upper chamber.</TE>
<TE>   In the governor's race, Davis and Simon were each hoping to make
history in their own fashion.</TE>
<TE>   The incumbent Democrat was vying to lead a party sweep down the
statewide ballot. If successful, it would be the first partisan
blowout since 1946, when Republicans seized every office. The last
time Democrats swept was in 1882.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, in turn, had been hoping to make Davis the first incumbent
denied a second term since 1942, when Democrat Culbert Olson lost to
Republican Earl Warren.</TE>
<TE>   The contest was historic in at least one sense: The combined
third-party vote may be the strongest since Commonwealth-Progressive
candidate Raymond L. Haight got 13% of the vote in 1934.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a Los Angeles Times exit poll found ample evidence of the
widespread grumbling that became a soundtrack for this discontented
election season.</TE>
<TE>   Voters had overwhelmingly unfavorable impressions of both Davis
and Simon, with roughly six in 10 expressing negative views about the
two major party candidates. A like number, about 60%, disapproved of
Davis' job performance over the past four years while just about half
of voters said the state was heading down the wrong track.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to compare the two on issues, at least a quarter of those
interviewed picked neither candidate when asked who would do a better
job on energy, homeland security, crime and the economy. Asked which
candidate had more honesty and integrity, fully a third of voters
said neither.</TE>
<TE>   For all that, Davis forces celebrated a victory that continued the
Democrats' hegemony in California, where the party has now won four
straight top-of-the-ticket races.</TE>
<TE>   A contest that was tighter than expected did not seem to dampen
the spirit of Davis donors and supporters who converged on the
Century Plaza Hotel by the hundreds.</TE>
<TE>   Big donors -- from business executives to labor leaders -- came to
party, and party they did. From the basement ballroom where the
official celebration got underway at 8 p.m. to the penthouse suite,
Cabinet secretaries, down-ballot candidates and other Democrats
watched returns and celebrated the anticipated Davis victory. The
governor arrived at the hotel around 9 p.m., after a leisurely dinner
at the nearby St. Regis Hotel with about 20 supporters.</TE>
<TE>   In an 18th-floor suite, Davis, dressed in a dark suit with an
American flag lapel pin, held hands and talked with his wife, Sharon,
as they watched returns on a television set.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, Republicans were heartened by early returns that
showed the contest much closer than many had expected.</TE>
<TE>   By 8:30 p.m., about 100 Republicans milled around a ballroom in
the LAX Westin Hotel, where Simon was holding his election night
party. The room was bare-bones, by campaign celebration standards: no
spangly streamers or red, white and blue balloons festooned the
walls. Instead, a large California flag was draped behind an empty
stage, adorned only with an American flag and a Simon placard stuck
on a lectern.</TE>
<TE>   The gubernatorial candidate remained sequestered in a second-floor
suite with his family and campaign consultants Sal Russo and Ed
Rollins. At 9 p.m., a crowd clustered around a large screen TV in the
ballroom erupted in cheers and people punched their fists in the air
as a television station showed Simon with a slight edge in a batch of
early returns, 46% to 45%.</TE>
<TE>   The unexpectedly narrow loss made it all the more agonizing for
Republicans, many of whom asserted a better candidate could have
easily beaten Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "This election is a tragic lost opportunity," said Arnold
Steinberg, a GOP strategist who sat out the governor's race. "Davis
was a classic vulnerable incumbent who generated little enthusiasm,
even among his base ... Republicans simply needed an adequate
campaign, not a brilliant one."</TE>
<TE>   Many Californians expressed their attitude toward the two major
candidates by simply not voting.</TE>
<TE>   Heading into Tuesday, the secretary of state forecast about 8.8
million of the state's 15.2 million registered voters would cast
ballots, a turnout that translated to 58% and tied the record low set
four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But anecdotal evidence suggested the turnout could be even lower.</TE>
<TE>   At closing time, voter turnout at 30 sample precincts in Los
Angeles County was 45.5%, down from 53.4% at the same time in the
November 1998 general election.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, Davis and Simon were battling not just one another but
a mood -- a combination of apathy and antipathy -- that hung over the
election like a dank fog.</TE>
<TE>   After a smooth start to his administration, thanks in good part to
the roaring economy, Davis' political fortunes rapidly soured with
the onset of the state's prolonged electricity crisis.</TE>
<TE>   His problems were compounded this year by a $23.6-billion
recession-induced budget deficit--barely papered over after a
two-month standoff--and a series of revelations about his aggressive
fund-raising tactics.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's political strategists decided early on that Davis
would never win a contest based on his popularity. So instead he set
out to destroy his opponents, starting in the Republican primary when
he intervened with a $10-million ad blitz that helped topple the
front-runner, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   That left the more conservative and inexperienced Simon as Davis'
November opponent.</TE>
<TE>   While the GOP nominee struggled to raise cash and rally support
within his own dispirited party, Davis dominated the television
airwaves with a series of advertisements that hammered his rival over
his controversial business dealings and frequent campaign missteps.</TE>
<TE>   The result was a pair of battered and bruised candidates that,
surveys showed, left many Californians feeling little affection
toward either. Michelle Allman, a 26-year-old homemaker from
Bloomington in San Bernardino County, said she headed to the polls
Tuesday morning with one vote in mind: anybody but the two candidates
everyone's been talking about.</TE>
<TE>   "All I cared about was voting for someone besides Davis or Simon,"
she said while waiting at an Inland Empire car wash. "I saw their
names, skipped right past them and went to the other ones, and then I
did an 'eeny, meeny, miney, mo.' I don't even remember the name of
the guy I voted for. Because it didn't matter."</TE>

<TE>   How the poll was conducted: The Times Poll interviewed 3,436
voters as they left 60 polling places across California during voting
hours Tuesday. Precincts were chosen based on the pattern of turnout
in past statewide elections. The survey was by a confidential,
self-administered questionnaire in English and Spanish. The margin of
sampling error for percentages based on the entire sample is plus or
minus 2 percentage points; for some subgroups the error margin may be
somewhat higher. Because the survey does not include absentee voters
or those who declined to participate when approached, actual returns
and demographic estimates by the interviewers were used to adjust the
sample slightly. Interviews at the precinct level were conducted by
Davis Research of Calabasas.</TE>

<HD>City Says No-Go to Secession</HD>
<DH>Valley measure leads at home, but it's not enough.
Hollywood effort soundly defeated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sue Fox and Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles voters spurned both San Fernando Valley and Hollywood
secession proposals Tuesday, deciding overwhelmingly to keep the
nation's second-largest city intact.</LD>
<LD>   In the Valley, the spawning ground of the secession movement, the
breakup plan was leading, but to pass, the measure needed a citywide
majority. In Hollywood, secession was losing badly.</LD>
<LD>   Half an hour after the polls closed, a confident Mayor James K.
Hahn, who led the anti-secession campaign, already was relaxing at a
cocktail reception in a Universal City hotel, alongside more than 400
developers, lobbyists, union members and other breakup opponents.</LD>
<TE>   "Clearly, an overwhelming majority of the people of Los Angeles
don't want to see it broken up," Hahn said as the returns began to
tumble in.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to tell people out there, no matter which way they voted,
tomorrow is the first day of all of our lives and we are going to
build a great city together," he told the cheering crowd.</TE>
<TE>   A few miles away at a Sherman Oaks hotel, about 250 Valley
secessionists gathered under a canopy of red and blue balloons to
watch the returns.</TE>
<TE>   Breakup leader Richard Katz said the proposal was buried under an
avalanche of anti-secession campaign cash and union opposition.</TE>
<TE>   The drive to defeat secession raised $7 million, more than four
times the breakup proponents' $1.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We have sent a message to City Hall that even those who are
tone-deaf can't miss," said Katz, a former assemblyman. "Life in Los
Angeles will never be the same."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, chairman of the secession group Valley VOTE, said
the organization might file a lawsuit if secession wins in the Valley
but loses citywide.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Valley votes to leave Los Angeles, we shouldn't be held
hostage," Close insisted.</TE>
<TE>   He also said if that happens he does not plan to work with Hahn to
address Valley concerns. "He hasn't been a problem-solver," he said
of the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge), a candidate for Valley
mayor, was leading nine other candidates. Richman was also coasting
to reelection in his Assembly race.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me be clear: This is not the end," Richman said as the votes
against secession began to mount. "I intend to work with the Valley
candidates in holding Mayor Hahn and the council members' feet to the
fire when it comes to city issues and services."</TE>
<TE>   The winners in the races for Valley mayor and 14 Valley council
seats, as well as for five Hollywood council posts, would have taken
office only if secession had won.</TE>
<TE>   As for the name Valley voters preferred for a new city, the
straight-forward "San Fernando Valley" easily outpaced choices such
as "Camelot" or "Rancho San Fernando."</TE>
<TE>   At the Hollywood Independence Committee's headquarters, about 100
candidates and supporters gathered around loudspeakers blaring the
Measure H campaign's rock 'n' roll theme song, belting out the lyrics
at the top of their lungs.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, L.A., set Hollywood free! Give her back her dignity!"</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before midnight, Gene La Pietra, the wealthy nightclub
owner who bankrolled the Hollywood secession bid, conceded defeat. "I
believe in what we've done here. We've put the spotlight on
Hollywood," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn assembled a potent coalition of municipal unions, black and
Latino leaders, billionaire business moguls and most of the city's
politicians to raise the money to put down the Valley and Hollywood
insurrections.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's L.A. United campaign deluged the television airwaves
with ads warning of secession's dire consequences for public safety,
taxes, utility costs and rent control.</TE>
<TE>   Separatists had limited options for countering such claims, which
they labeled scare tactics. Pressed for money, they aired their
commercials only on cable stations, and otherwise relied on mailers,
debates, e-mail messages and word of mouth to persuade voters.</TE>
<TE>   The results Tuesday were hardly a surprise, even for some
hard-core secessionists who have toiled for years to carve out the
two cities.</TE>
<TE>   The breakup campaign had been hobbled since spring by the money
shortage, leadership troubles and a lack of volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Polls have shown support for secession withering in almost every
quarter of the city in recent months--except the West Valley, a
relatively affluent and conservative area where voters were closely
divided.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to win, is it?" Johnny Gearhart, a Hollywood
secession supporter, said wistfully after he cast his ballot Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, it appeared that the separatists' high point came
months ago when they landed their breakup proposals on the ballot. It
was a striking achievement for a small band of suburbanites who had
chipped away at the established order of city government for six
years.</TE>
<TE>   Valley secessionists managed to rewrite state law to allow
voters--not city councils--to decide the fate of cityhood proposals.
They collected signatures from 25% of the Valley's registered voters,
triggering a study of secession's financial effects and forcing
skeptical Los Angeles leaders to take their complaints ever more
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders even got the state, county and city to foot the
study's $2-million bill.</TE>
<TE>   Impressed by the Valley movement's advances, La Pietra helped
spark a parallel effort in Hollywood. But the Hollywood bid, driven
by more than $2 million in contributions from La Pietra, never had
the broad base of support evident in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   After an exhaustive two-year study, the Local Agency Formation
Commission found that Valley and Hollywood cities would be
financially viable without damaging the rest of Los Angeles, setting
the stage for Tuesday's showdown.</TE>
<TE>   Secession fever ran high among the tract homes sprawling in the
hills of Porter Ranch, at the Valley's northern rim. Dozens of people
leaving the polls said they voted yes on Measure F, the Valley
cityhood proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen the Valley go downhill over the years," said Linda
Rudell, 55, who has lived in the northwest Valley for most of her
life. "You can see a difference when you drive into cities like Santa
Monica, Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena."</TE>
<TE>   But at several polling places on the other side of the hill,
voters voiced little sympathy for secessionist claims that the Valley
and Hollywood are treated unfairly. Many said they rejected the
breakup proposals because they feared that a split might drive up
taxes, curtail public services and spoil the image of L.A.'s diverse
yet united neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a bad idea and we the taxpayers will end up paying
more if it passes," said retiree Ervin Hogan after casting his ballot
in South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In Boyle Heights, Yolanda Hernandez said that the city's recent
attempts to spin power away from City Hall should be given a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "It would cut a lot of the services here if we break apart," said
Hernandez, a member of the newly certified Boyle Heights Neighborhood
Council.</TE>
<TE>   Sensing that his message of unification and steadily improving
city services had taken root, Hahn was upbeat after voting Tuesday
morning near his San Pedro home. The mayor worked the phones at the
Los Angeles County Federation of Labor's offices, personally reaching
out to voters to ask them to reject secession. Some people didn't
believe it was actually the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi Deborah, this is Mayor Jim Hahn calling," the mayor said. "No,
this is not a recording. Would you like a recording?"</TE>
<TE>   As the election approached, Hahn lavished attention on the
breakaway regions, especially the Valley, holding multiple media
events each day to plug potholes, tout the neighborhood councils or
simply lend an ear.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn even invited Blake Nordstrom, president of the department
store noted for its attentive clerks, to give the city's general
managers some pointers on customer service.</TE>
<TE>   "We put together a tremendous coalition of business and labor and
community-based organizations," Hahn said as the sun set Tuesday. "I
really do think we got our message out that the city is moving
forward, things are improving and breaking up would move us in the
wrong direction."</TE>
<TE>   Even before Tuesday's vote, separatists had steadily gained ground
in their grass-roots crusade for more local control. They didn't
always get exactly what they wanted, but they did succeed in focusing
public debate on their complaints that City Hall is wasteful,
arrogant and unresponsive.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1999 overhaul of the City Charter, many secessionists
pressed for a system of neighborhood councils empowered with land-use
and budget authority. Instead, the councils wound up being advisory
panels, which convinced many residents that breaking off from Los
Angeles was the only solution.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles is just a completely gridlocked system," said C.
Edward Dilkes, a municipal law expert who served briefly as director
of the elected charter commission.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone has his or her own little grip ... on a tiny piece of
the political system, and it's not possible to change anything
without goring the ox of someone who's important," said Dilkes, a
Hollywood resident running for city council in the proposed city.</TE>
<TE>   As if to prove the point, a group of Los Angeles City Council
members announced Tuesday -- even as voters were streaming to the
polls -- that they will meet in the Valley today to renew their
commitment to improving city services.</TE>
<TE>   Council members Dennis Zine, Jack Weiss, Ruth Galanter, Alex
Padilla, Cindy Miscikowski and Nick Pacheco are scheduled to appear
on the steps of Van Nuys City Hall -- the symbolic heart of the
Valley -- for a morning news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Lamishaw, a Valley council candidate from Van Nuys, vowed
to support a fresh secession effort if city services did not improve.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal is not to have two cities or 50 cities," he said. "The
goal is to have a better place to live."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Republican gains in Tuesday's election testified to the
transformation of President Bush's standing with the American public
in the months since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   With his job approval rating approaching the midterm election as
high as any president's since John F. Kennedy's in 1962, Bush threw
himself into the campaign, gambling that he could transform his
personal popularity into congressional gains for the GOP.</LD>
<LD>   His bet paid off, spectacularly. Bush managed a historic feat
Tuesday night: He helped his party win seats in both chambers of
Congress during his first midterm election. Since the Civil War, the
only other president to achieve such a midterm sweep was Franklin D.
Roosevelt in 1934, when he was still basking in the glow of his first
100 days and the New Deal.</LD>
<TE>   The GOP didn't gain as much ground on Capitol Hill on Tuesday as
Democrats did in 1934. And the Republican advance wasn't unqualified;
Democrats pointed with pride at their recapture of the governor's
offices in big states such as Michigan, Illinois and Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   But the Democratic successes in those states couldn't salve the
disappointment over the dramatic setbacks on Capitol Hill. Retaking
the Senate and holding the House at a time when Americans were so
uneasy about the economy represents an enormous achievement for the
GOP -- and a critical missed chance for the Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to look at it from their perspective and say it was a
blown opportunity," said Rep. Thomas M. Davis (R-Va.), chairman of
the National Republican Congressional Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The strong GOP showing, amid widespread uneasiness over the
economy, is bound to produce intense finger-pointing from dissident
Democrats who believe the congressional leadership failed to define a
clear alternative agenda to Bush's, especially on the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "The most significant fact politically of the past 18 months has
been the incapacity of the Democratic Party to mount an effective
critique of the Bush economic program or to propose a meaningful
alternative to it," said Bill Galston, a top domestic policy advisor
to President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, former Clinton campaign manager James Carville declared
on CNN on Tuesday night: "Part of the Democrats' problem is
timidity."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's Republican gains were more a tilt than a tide; though
they bucked the historic precedent, the GOP advances didn't approach
the scale of the party's breakthrough in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Yet because the parties have been so balanced over the last
half-decade, even small changes in the vote can trigger large tremors
in Washington. The Republican gains in the Senate were modest, but
because the Democrats held such a precarious majority to start, they
were enough to move the GOP back into control.</TE>
<TE>   In a period when neither party has established a lasting hold on
the electorate, the new GOP majority will still be small enough that
Democrats can legitimately hope to recapture the chamber in 2004. Yet
in that next election, Democrats will face the same challenge they
did this year: a battlefield that favors Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Half of the 14 Democrats seeking reelection this fall ran in the
"red" states that Bush won in 2000, as did all of the seven leading
Democratic challengers. With Bush's popularity high, these Democrats
became extremely reluctant to disagree with the president; almost all
endorsed his tax cut and his demand for congressional authority to
invade Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   That made it tough for Democratic leaders to fashion an opposition
agenda to Bush in the Senate, since so many of the "red state"
Democrats were reluctant to vote against the administration, or to
devise a sharp critique of Bush's record on the campaign trail.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Republicans such as Rep. Saxby Chambliss, who defeated
Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., and Rep. Lindsey O. Graham, who won an open
Senate seat in South Carolina, effectively highlighted national
security themes that loomed larger for voters in the aftermath of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans beat at least two "red state" Senate Democrats: Jean
Carnahan in Missouri and Cleland in Georgia, and were closing in on a
third, Tim Johnson in South Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   Of the seven seriously contested Senate seats the GOP was
defending in red states, it lost only one: Sen. Tim Hutchinson,
hobbled by controversy over his personal life, was defeated in
Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   The same "red-state" challenge will reemerge in 2004, when nine of
the 19 Democratic senators up for reelection will be running in
states that Bush carried -- six in states he carried by double
digits. Of the 15 Republicans facing reelection in 2004, just three
are in the "blue" states that Al Gore carried in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   If "red-state" Democrats were hesitant about confronting Bush when
he didn't appear on the ballot, they may be even more reluctant when
he is running.</TE>
<TE>   That could give Bush added leverage to push his agenda, especially
on further tax cuts, through a Senate still divided so narrowly.</TE>
<TE>   On the House side, Tuesday's results may mark a turning point.
Though Republicans have held the majority since 1994, Democrats
gained small numbers of seats in the last three elections, raising
their hopes that they were slowly chipping their way back to the
majority.</TE>
<TE>   Now, some Democrats believe that they have hit a wall that could
leave the GOP in control of the House for some time -- absent a major
event, such as an economic downturn more dramatic than the one
affecting the country now.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a reason Democrats were in control of the House 40
years," said one Democratic strategist. "If you are slogging it out
seat by seat as we have been doing over the past three or four
cycles, it's hard to do."</TE>
<TE>   Two tactical factors bolstered the GOP in its drive to hold the
House. One was that the decennial redistricting process reduced the
number of competitive seats, forcing Democrats to win a dauntingly
high percentage of the seats left in play to make the six-seat gain
they needed. The second was a significant Republican financial
advantage that allowed the GOP to pour huge sums into the few
targeted races.</TE>
<TE>   These advantages, layered atop continued Republican dominance in
the South, the Mountain West and many rural districts, won't
dissipate anytime soon. This led some Democrats Tuesday night to
agree with Rep. Davis when he said, "Democrats aren't going to be
able to win this thing back incrementally. They will have to catch a
wave."</TE>
<TE>   However the final races sort out, it appears that the Republican
advance Tuesday wasn't large enough to suggest that they have
decisively broken out of the 50-50 divide that has defined American
politics for the last half-decade. The overall balance of power on
Capitol Hill remains slim.</TE>
<TE>   But Tuesday's results displayed an edge for the GOP that will
surely increase Democratic anxiety about the prospects of unseating
Bush in 2004. Even before the votes came in, some Democratic
strategists already were questioning whether the party had been too
cautious this year.</TE>
<TE>   In most competitive Senate campaigns, Democratic candidates tried
to focus voters' attention on issues where Democrats believed they
held an advantage, particularly Social Security and prescription
drugs for seniors.</TE>
<TE>   But that strategy appeared to fail. After choosing not to
challenge the tax cut, Democratic candidates were left without either
a clear economic critique of Bush's record or an alternative to the
Republican program, which centered on making the tax cut permanent.</TE>
<TE>   That was one key reason Democrats were unable to benefit from
voter anxiety over the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way you can explain that," said Matthew Dowd, director
of polling at the Republican National Committee, "is that voters
haven't heard anything from the other side."</TE>
<TE>   Stanley B. Greenberg, a former pollster to Bill Clinton and Al
Gore, says the lesson of this campaign is that "Democrats can't win
[Congress] race by race. You can't expect to run better campaigns,
recruit better campaigns, spend more money.... It's Democrats above
all who need big ideas, who need to create an election that is about
something. Otherwise, you can't overcome these other [Republican]
advantages."</TE>

<HD>Bush Is the Prime Beneficiary of Republican Gains</HD>
<DH>By putting his prestige and popularity behind Republican
candidates nationwide, president may have revived his own political
agenda.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edwin Chen and Maura Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>His name wasn't on the ballot, but perhaps the biggest winner in
Tuesday's election was George W. Bush.</LD>
<LD>   In the weeks leading up to the vote, the president put diplomacy
and war planning on the back burner and plunged into politics,
putting his popularity and prestige behind the Republican push to
regain control of Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's gamble paid off: . The GOP retained control of the House
and regained the Senate.</LD>
<TE>   With those new GOP victories, Bush now will have more clout to
pursue a political agenda that stalled last year when Republicans
lost control of the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials crowed that for the first time since 1934,
the president's party gained seats in both the House and Senate
during a first midterm election.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how it ends up tonight, history was made," said White
House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP performance suggested that Bush's popularity has
translated into real gains for his party. In the hard-fought House,
Senate and gubernatorial districts where the president campaigned, at
least three out of four of the GOP candidates appeared victorious.</TE>
<TE>   The sweetest victories for Bush may have been in Texas, the
president's home state, where the Republicans held on to a crucial
Senate seat and retained the governor's office, and in Florida, where
his brother was reelected governor by an unexpectedly large margin.</TE>
<TE>   "It's looking like a Republican night," said GOP strategist Scott
Reed, who managed Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign. "It is a
vindication of Bush's aggressive strategy to take back the Congress,
and will allow the White House to get back on the offensive on its
issues."</TE>
<TE>   With the Republicans in control of both chambers, the White House
is likely to make a concerted push for more tax cuts and an energy
plan that would open a small portion of the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge to oil and gas exploration.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also can be expected to renew his drive to create a
Department of Homeland Security, break a logjam over about 80
nominations to the federal bench and pass tort reform aimed primarily
at curbing medical malpractice lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   It will be tempting for Republicans to view the 2002 results as
boding well for Bush's reelection chances in 2004. However, Charlie
Cook, a Washington-based independent political analyst, cautioned
against that interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically, midterm elections are of little, if any, use in
predicting how a president will do two years later," he said. "Since
the party holding the White House has lost House seats in 32 out of
34 midterm elections, and many presidents get reelected, that's
obviously the case," Cook added.</TE>
<TE>   And even though Bush campaigned extensively for much of the year,
Fred Greenstein, a presidential historian at Princeton University,
said the election should not be seen as a referendum on Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't that the president is being vindicated" by the midterm
vote, he said. "It's that he didn't have coattails in the [2000]
election. He didn't even win the popular vote. Ironically, not losing
seats is a sign of how underwhelming he was in the general election."</TE>
<TE>   Other analysts said Bush's aggressive campaigning and fund-raising
for Republicans across the country clearly paid off.</TE>
<TE>   "An election that could have turned into a disaster for the
governing party will be little worse than slightly tilted to
Democrats, maybe even a wash or exhibiting some GOP gains in one or
both houses of Congress," said Larry J. Sabato, a University of
Virginia political scientist.</TE>
<TE>   "In this kind of slow economy, with a president who lost the
popular vote, even a wash for the Republicans has got to be welcome
for them," Sabato said.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you can safely conclude that one of the reasons the
historical trend has been broken is because of the president's
popularity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The president appeared at an estimated 67 fund-raising events and
raised more than $142 million -- a record.</TE>
<TE>   As the campaign neared an end, he focused increasingly on
candidates for the House and Senate in excruciatingly tight races.</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   In the final week of the campaign, Bush traveled to 15 states
before ending up in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "The president hopes that it makes a difference in these close
races," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   After spending Monday night at their ranch near Crawford, Texas,
the president and first lady voted early Tuesday morning at the
Crawford Volunteer Fire Department and then returned to the White
House.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Washington, the couple -- who were also marking their 25th
wedding anniversary -- gave an early dinner for key Republican
leaders. Guests included House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.),
Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), Republican National
Committee chairman Mark Racicot and Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.).</TE>
<TE>   After dinner, Bush watched the election results with a handful of
close aides, and placed more than 30 congratulatory telephone calls
to Republican winners.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the recipient of his first call was his younger
brother, Jeb, who easily won reelection as Florida governor. The
brothers' parents -- former President George Bush and his wife,
Barbara, joined the celebrations at Jeb Bush's headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said the president was literally sitting on the edge of
his seat, "beaming with pride" as his younger brother delivered his
victory speech.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a poignant moment," Fleischer said.</TE>

<HD>GOP Takes Over Senate</HD>
<DH>Republicans Retain Their Majority in the House</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a significant victory for President Bush, Republicans early today
wrested control of the Senate from the Democrats and retained their
majority in the House.</LD>
<LD>   The president had put his prestige on the line to campaign for
Republican candidates around the country, trying to translate his own
popularity into political gains for the GOP.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans may have expanded their six-seat majority in the
House, once returns from all the races are in. That would defy
historic trends, because the president's party usually loses House
seats in midterm elections.</LD>
<TE>   "President Bush and the Republican Party tonight have made
history," said White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, having once again fallen short of regaining the House
majority status they lost in 1994, looked to the future. "Tomorrow
begins the election of 2004," said House Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi
(D-San Francisco).</TE>
<TE>   The Senate power shift came when Sen. Jean Carnahan (D-Mo.)
conceded defeat to GOP Rep. Jim Talent, making him the 50th
Republican senator in the new Congress. Even if Republicans pick up
no other seats -- two races in South Dakota and Minnesota remained
too close to call early today -- Republicans would control a Senate
split 50-50 between the parties because Vice President Dick Cheney
has the power to cast tie-breaking votes in the chamber.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican takeover of the Senate, which many analysts had not
considered likely heading into election day, restores the power the
GOP enjoyed for the first half of 2001 when it passed Bush's sweeping
tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans lost control of the Senate in midyear when Sen. James
M. Jeffords of Vermont quit the GOP to become an independent, giving
Democrats a one-seat majority.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Democratic-controlled Senate has proved a
formidable obstacle to Bush's legislative agenda, most recently
slowing action on his proposed Department of Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   That's a big reason Bush has spent so much time campaigning and
raising money for GOP candidates, traveling to 17 cities in 15 states
in the last five days of the campaign alone.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with Republicans controlling the Senate floor schedule and
chairing its committees, Bush will have far more leverage in pushing
his agenda of more tax cuts, higher defense spending and conservative
judges as he prepares for his own reelection bid in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an enormous asset in terms of his being able to define
the agenda in 2003," said GOP pollster Bill McInturff. "This guy
still has juice."</TE>
<TE>   The dramatic and unexpected power shift was a fitting coda to an
election campaign that has been anything but ordinary. Candidates and
the national political parties have been buffeted by a series of
traumatic events, such as last year's terrorist attacks, the plunging
stock market, a spate of corporate scandals and the threat of war
with Iraq. And one of the nation's most closely watched Senate races
was roiled less than two weeks before election day by the death of
Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.).</TE>
<TE>   Although Republican control of both the House and Senate are
assured, the precise breakdown will not be known until all the
ballots are tallied.</TE>
<TE>   Heading into election day, the breakdown in the House was 223
Republicans, 208 Democrats and one independent who usually votes with
the Democrats, with three vacant seats. After Wellstone's death, the
Senate consisted of 49 Democrats, 49 Republicans and one independent
who sides with the Democrats. (Dean Barkley, the independent
appointed to temporarily replace Wellstone, was sworn in Tuesday but
will serve only a limited time, perhaps only a few weeks.)</TE>
<TE>   Tallying Tuesday's voting for the House, Associated Press reported
that Republicans had won 223 seats and were leading in four others.</TE>
<TE>   Two Senate races remained too close to call: the contest in South
Dakota between Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson and Republican Rep. John
R. Thune; and the battle in Minnesota between former Vice President
Walter F. Mondale, who replaced Wellstone as the Democratic
candidate, and Republican Norm Coleman. Early today, Coleman was
leading but the count was slow.</TE>
<TE>   Carnahan's concession put Republicans over the top, but it was
just one of a series of bad breaks for the Democrats through the
night. Earlier, in Georgia, GOP Rep. Saxby Chambliss scored an upset
victory over Sen. Max Cleland. Republicans also managed to hold onto
all five of the open Senate seats previously held by the GOP -- in
Texas, North Carolina, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans won another important victory in Colorado, where Sen.
Wayne Allard won a hard-fought reelection fight. About the only good
news for Senate Democrats came when GOP Sen. Tim Hutchinson of
Arkansas, battered by controversy over the divorce of his wife and
his marriage to a former aide, was defeated by Democrat Mark Pryor.</TE>
<TE>   In the House, Democrats went into election day knowing they faced
an uphill battle to reach a majority. Early House returns were not
encouraging. Kentucky GOP Rep. Anne M. Northup, considered one of her
party's most vulnerable incumbents, triumphed over Democrat Jack
Conway.</TE>
<TE>   In Indiana, in one of the most hotly contested open House seats,
GOP businessman Chris Chocola appeared poised to capture a seat held
by a retiring Democrat. In West Virginia, Rep. Shelley Moore Capito,
another endangered Republican, pulled off a victory. And in Florida,
Democratic Rep. Karen L. Thurman trailed her Republican challenger.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats cheered gains in other contests, including the defeat of
GOP Rep. Constance A. Morella (R-Md.) at the hands of Democrat Chris
Van Hollen. But party strategists knew early on that winning a
majority was out of reach. Pelosi acknowledged that many
rank-and-file Democrats were falling short because they believed the
party faltered in this campaign by being too timid in presenting an
alternative to the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   "We may not have been strong enough with our message," Pelosi
said. "I do think it behooves the national party to be clear enough
about the distinction between the two parties."</TE>
<TE>   While Republican control of both the House and Senate gives the
president and his party enormous new leverage, there are limits to
what can be accomplished. Democrats in the Senate still have great
power to slow and block legislation. Republicans will be operating in
both chambers on the kind of narrow margins that have been typical
after the last two elections.</TE>
<TE>   These close divisions have created a state of political parity
that has made it difficult for either party to make major strides on
their legislative agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Although the election results are expected to make only marginal
changes in the status quo, the campaign has cost huge sums. As of
mid-October, the Federal Election Commission reports that House and
Senate candidates and the two national parties had spent a total of
$1.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Although the amount spent by candidates themselves is down
somewhat from 2000, the final total is expected to include a record
amount of "soft money" -- the largely unregulated contributions to
the parties from corporations, labor unions and wealthy individuals.
Soft money donations are banned as of today, under the campaign
finance law enacted earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   But political operatives in both parties are already moving to
exploit loopholes and set up new groups to channel big donations into
politics. Much of the money has been spent on television advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Especially controversial were ads by Republicans that featured
images of Osama bin Laden and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</TE>

<HD>No Joke: Florida Election Is Smooth</HD>
<DH>Touch screen voting machines work well in a state where
past snafus made it a laughingstock.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John-Thor Dahlburg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>MIAMI -- An unusual thing happened Tuesday in Florida, land of the
perplexingly designed ballot and dragged-out vote tally. They held an
election again, and it came off smoothly. There was even a winner
before people went to bed.</LD>
<LD>   "No voter was turned away if they were at the correct precinct and
they were eligible voters," boasted Miriam M. Oliphant, elections
supervisor in Broward County, who was criticized for the glitches
last time around.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, nearly two months of frenzied preparations,
military-style planning, poll worker retraining, millions of dollars
in additional spending, and large-scale drafting of police and civil
servants paid off.</LD>
<TE>   There was even a final result less than two hours after the last
polls in the Panhandle closed. Incumbent Republican Gov. Jeb Bush,
the president's brother, had won a second term, fending off Democrat
Bill McBride.</TE>
<TE>   Florida's error-prone electoral process has been a rich vein for
the likes of Leno and Letterman, but from now on, said Richard
Conley, assistant professor of political science at the University of
Florida, "other states will take over -- they will make the comedy
hour."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's worst teething pains with voting technology, in fact,
were not in the Sunshine State, but elsewhere. In Fort Worth, and
nearby cities, computers had trouble reading nearly 300,000 ballots
that might have been marked with straight party-line votes. In some
counties of Georgia and North Carolina, balky touch-screen voting
machines were also reported.</TE>
<TE>   In Florida's Sept. 10 party primary, the polling station inside
Thena C. Crowder Elementary School in Miami's Liberty City was the
kind of electoral horror show that catapulted Florida into the
headlines.</TE>
<TE>   Would-be voters were sent away by the hundreds after new touch
screen voting machines crashed and couldn't be revived for more than
five hours. A downpour doused the neighborhood, and rain and
lightning strikes cut off power at least three times.</TE>
<TE>   In stark contrast, polling in Precinct 507 opened at 7 a.m.
Tuesday in the school atrium as scheduled, and voting was so easy
that Carlton Bellamy, 54, wrongly thought the touch screen machines,
which function like ATMs, had been replaced.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fine, great," said the church worker and missionary, who
left the polls on a bicycle with his granddaughter Drucilla, 6,
perched on the handlebars. "Ten minutes this time, compared to three
hours last time."</TE>
<TE>   After the 2000 presidential contest, bitter and partisan disputes
over the size of holes voters punched in ballots, confusing butterfly
ballots in Palm Beach County and other problems in Florida held up
for 35 days the proclamation of George W. Bush as ultimate victor.</TE>
<TE>   The state spent $32 million to replace punch card voting machines
and make other electoral reforms. However, difficulties with new,
unfamiliar touch screen machines and unprepared and ill-trained poll
workers caused another mess in South Florida during the primary. It
took a week to tabulate the ballots.</TE>
<TE>   For Tuesday, more than 1,000 public employees were mobilized to
help in Broward, and in Miami-Dade County, the number was easily
three times that. At Crowder Elementary, the polling staff was
doubled, to 10, including employees of Miami-Dade Fire-Rescue and the
county water and sewer department.</TE>
<TE>   Police in Miami-Dade played an unprecedented role, taking command
of election logistics and planning and assuming responsibility for
the transport of polling personnel, voting machines and the
sandwiches, cookies and potato chips provided to poll workers for
lunch.</TE>
<TE>   In Broward County, commissioners wrested effective control of
polling preparations from Oliphant, a novice elections supervisor
discredited in the primary fiasco. A 588-step checklist was compiled,
with officials working out of the same emergency command post they
would use during a hurricane.</TE>
<TE>   "These new machines are a whole lot better," said Scott Allen, 32,
a Broward parking attendant. "The ballot was just so long, but I got
something in the mail so I knew what to expect. I went to my polling
place in Pembroke Pines at 7 a.m., and there were about 20 people in
front of me. I was in and out in 40 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't a picture-perfect day: At least three counties in
central Florida reported malfunctions with another type of voting
machine, the optical scanner. People for the American Way Foundation,
one of many organizations to send poll monitors and lawyers to
Florida, claimed that touch screen machines in eight Miami-area
precincts were counting ballots cast for Democrat Bill McBride as
votes for his opponent, Jeb Bush.</TE>
<TE>   But only hours after the polls opened, it was clear that the
nation's fourth most populous state was not headed for yet another
election day train wreck.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights and a critic of past elections in Florida, said: "There were
glitches in Miami-Dade County and in Broward, but the glitches were
fixed. It's wonderful that Florida finally had a good election."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, after weeks of warning that Los Angeles County was
facing a shortage of poll workers, officials said Tuesday that there
were more than enough volunteers to run the county's 4,922 voting
locations.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been dealing with very minor issues," said county
Registrar-Recorder Conny B. McCormack.</TE>
<TE>   According to McCormack, 28 polling places opened late -- the norm
for Los Angeles County. (In one case, a voting supervisor forgot that
Tuesday was election day. In another instance, a custodian forgot to
unlock the library for poll workers.) Nearly 23,000 people --
including top county officials -- showed up at polling places to
volunteer.</TE>

<HD>Democrats Gain Governor Seats</HD>
<DH>The GOP keeps Florida but the party stands to lose its
majority of state executives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Despite Republican victories Tuesday in Florida and other prominent
states, Democrats scored significant gains in gubernatorial contests
and were battling to deny the GOP a majority of governorships for the
first time in eight years.</LD>
<LD>   With wins in Illinois, Pennsylvania and Michigan, Democrats made
inroads in the Midwest and elsewhere as voters chose governors in 36
states. Next year, the chief executives of the 50 states will be
nearly evenly split between the two parties, although the exact ratio
was still unknown early today.</LD>
<LD>   Women also were nearing a milestone. Three female gubernatorial
candidates won election, raising the chances that a record-setting
six women would be governors next year.</LD>
<TE>   Republicans, on the defensive in a year when many of their
incumbents were leaving office and others were facing severe budget
trouble, held ground in several major states.</TE>
<TE>   New York Gov. George Pataki easily won a third four-year term,
defeating Democrat Carl McCall. Ohio Gov. Robert A. Taft cruised to
reelection. In his quest for a second term, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush
triumphed solidly over Democrat Bill McBride.</TE>
<TE>   And Texas Gov. Rick Perry beat Democrat Tony Sanchez in a bid for
his first full term after rising to the post George W. Bush left two
years ago to become president.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans also triumphed in two high-profile contests in the
Northeast. In Massachusetts, Mitt Romney, leader of the 2002 Salt
Lake City Olympics, defeated Democrat Shannon O'Brien to continue the
GOP's hold on the governorship in the otherwise solidly Democratic
state. In Maryland, Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. defeated Democrat Kathleen
Kennedy Townsend, who was aiming to become the first member of her
famous clan to be elected governor. He became the first Republican
governor in the state since Spiro T. Agnew in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   In Georgia, Republican Sonny Perdue beat Democratic incumbent Gov.
Roy Barnes in a major upset. He will be the first GOP governor in
that state in more than a century.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats claimed victory in at least nine states now governed
by Republicans and cheered as California Gov. Gray Davis defeated
Republican Bill Simon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Rendell, the former mayor of Philadelphia and onetime chairman
of the Democratic National Committee, defeated Republican Mike Fisher
in a race for governor of Pennsylvania. In Michigan, Democrat
Jennifer Granholm beat Republican Dick Posthumus to succeed a
retiring GOP incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   And in Illinois, Democrat Rod Blagojevich, a U.S. House member,
defeated Republican Jim Ryan. Blagojevich was the first Democrat in
30 years elected Illinois governor.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Democrats Phil Bredesen in Tennessee, Kathleen
Sebelius in Kansas, James Doyle in Wisconsin, Brad Henry in Oklahoma,
Dave Freudenthal in Wyoming and Bill Richardson in New Mexico took
governorships from the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   Before the elections, Republicans governed in 27 states, Democrats
in 21 and independents in Minnesota and Maine.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP had held the edge since the 1994 elections, when a
Republican tide swept the country. Before that, Democrats had
dominated the governorships for 24 years.</TE>
<TE>   During the last eight years, the Republican grip on governorships
gave the party wide influence over state and local policymaking and
helped it immensely in national politics. Republican governors helped
elect one of their own, Bush, to the presidency in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, more than half of Americans live in the 27 states
governed by Republicans. Those 27 states also account for a majority
of the Electoral College -- 298 electoral votes -- that will elect
the next president in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans managed to snare at least four governorships held by
Democrats. In New Hampshire, Republican Craig Benson defeated
Democrat Mark Fernald in the race to succeed an outgoing Democrat. In
South Carolina, Republican Mark Sanford unseated Democratic Gov. Jim
Hodges.</TE>
<TE>   But in Alabama, Democratic Gov. Donald Siegelman won a nail-biter
against Republican Bob Riley. Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa won
reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Several Republican incumbents coasted to victory, among them Bill
Owens of Colorado, John G. Rowland of Connecticut, Mike Johanns of
Nebraska and Kenny Guinn of Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Democrats were gaining. . They appeared close to
capturing a majority of governorships, or at least erasing the GOP
edge, with some races still in the balance early today. Their gains
would help the party challenge President Bush in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Several factors were pointing toward Democratic gains. Of the 36
races, Republicans were defending governorships in 23 states and
Democrats in just 11. Both parties also were vying for the posts held
by independent Govs. Angus S. King Jr. of Maine and Jesse Ventura of
Minnesota, neither of whom was running.</TE>
<TE>   Compounding the GOP, challenge, 12 incumbents were retiring,
declining to run or facing term limits. Of those, the party faced
possible losses in at least five contests.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the Republicans had to run as the incumbent party in most
states when a weakened economy has sapped tax revenues -- forcing
states to make tough choices between tax increases and spending cuts.</TE>
<TE>   The elections also were an important test for women seeking
elective office. Though women have made sizable gains since 1992 in
the House and Senate, they have lagged in governorships.</TE>
<TE>   Five women are now governors -- an all-time high. They are
Democrats Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Ruth Ann Minner of
Delaware and Republicans Judy Martz of Montana, Jane Dee Hull of
Arizona and Jane Swift of Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   Of that quintet, only Minner and Martz will be governors next
year. They will be joined by Sebelius of Kansas, Granholm of Michigan
and either Republican Linda Lingle or Democrat Mazie Hirono of
Hawaii. Democrat Janet Napolitano was leading in a tight race in
Arizona against Republican Matt Salmon. Should Napolitano win, there
would be a record six female governors in 2003. Another woman,
Democrat Fran Ulmer of Alaska, lost to Republican Frank H. Murkowski.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Soldier's Disappearance Surrounded by Mystery</HD>
<DH>The Pentagon says a Guantanamo Bay guard died accidentally.
His family is skeptical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard A. Serrano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A mysterious disappearance has focused attention on a largely
anonymous group: the nearly 2,000 military police officers and other
soldiers dispatched to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
to guard roughly 625 prisoners from the war in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Many are Army National Guardsmen and reservists. And as they
return home, they tell of a safe, almost serene environment with
little trouble from prisoners -- a not-so-bad assignment that has
made them feel useful in the war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   But it is still a jail, and prisoners and guards alike know there
is no real escape from the 45-square-mile base that the U.S. leases
from Cuba. A high-wire fence with Cuban sentries borders one flank of
the installation, the crystal-blue Caribbean waters the other.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps no other prison in the world is as tightly controlled as
the makeshift compound called Camp Delta. Yet the military cannot
explain how one of its own guards vanished.</TE>
<TE>   Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Foraker, a National Guardsman who would be
returning to his wife and two young daughters in Ohio about now, was
last seen on the base with a flashlight in hand in the early hours of
Sept. 24. A thin man with a slight mustache, Foraker left no note
behind when he left his barracks at 1:30 a.m. and, ostensibly, headed
out for some exercise on his night off. Authorities later found his
clothes, wallet and Army ID neatly folded in a rock crevice on a
20-foot cliff overlooking the water. The 31-year-old Persian Gulf War
veteran was gone.</TE>
<TE>   After describing his status for several weeks as "whereabouts
unknown," the Pentagon last week declared him "missing, presumed
dead." Foraker "most likely died of accidental causes in the waters
off Guantanamo Bay," the Pentagon concluded.</TE>
<TE>   But no body has been found, and the Army's initial reluctance to
let Foraker's wife visit the base -- and his family's knowledge of
Ryan -- make them suspicious of the official explanation.</TE>
<TE>   Carl J. Foraker believes his son is still alive, that he came upon
something "he was not supposed to see" on the base, and now is being
held incommunicado. "I've always heard how secure it is down there,
but evidently it's not, or they would find my son," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His wife theorizes he might have been abducted. "He was due to
come home in mid-November," said Angela Foraker of Logan, Ohio. "I
don't believe he would have done anything stupid to jeopardize coming
home."</TE>
<TE>   He was afraid of water and heights, so why was he ranging atop
that beachside cliff? "His mother used to take him to the pool when
he was child, but he was afraid of the water," his father said.</TE>
<TE>   But Army officials say Foraker had gone snorkeling with fellow
soldiers on occasion, and in the absence of any other explanation,
they assume he died accidentally in the water. Neither the Pentagon
nor the family suspects suicide.</TE>
<TE>   "The findings and the investigation concluded there was no
evidence of foul play," said Army Lt. Col. Ryan Yantis at the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "It is improbable that he left the island via boat, air or land.
He was a good soldier, and it's unlikely he went AWOL. We confirmed
he did not enter the country of Cuba.... This was a good soldier. A
good troop. He was respected," Yantis said. "And we do not like
leaving people behind."</TE>
<TE>   Under the circumstances at Guantanamo Bay, a guard's disappearance
is ironic.</TE>
<TE>   Foraker was part of a mission so intense that guards practically
monitor every time a detainee swats a fly in his wire-cage cell under
the harsh tropical sun. Even the wild iguanas, a protected species,
are kept from harm's way, with large fines for anyone who even
accidentally hits one of the large lizards on the roadway.</TE>
<TE>   The guards and military police typically spend their days and
evenings in groups -- working one of three shifts at Camp Delta and,
during their off hours, relaxing at the base bowling alley, the
outdoor theater or on a boat in the bay, deep-sea fishing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was probably accidental," said Command Sgt. Maj.
Raymond Funaro, who until this month supervised 1,600 military police
and guardsmen at "Gitmo" before returning to his Rhode Island
National Guard unit. "I think he just went in for a swim and never
made it out."</TE>
<TE>   Foraker came home from the Gulf War and drove a truck for a
pipeline company while remaining an Army reservist. After the
terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, he was called back to active
duty.</TE>
<TE>   "Life there wasn't the greatest," Angela Foraker said. "All of
them complained about some of their conditions. They complained about
their meals. That the detainees got fed better than they did. That
they didn't have a lot of hot water. You had to hold down a button to
take a shower, and there was no indoor plumbing at first."</TE>
<TE>   Army Sgt. Jason Rauser escorted prisoners from their cells to
interrogation rooms, to exercise yards and to the showers. He said
they rarely caused trouble. On his evenings off, Rauser said, he
watched movies like "Black Hawk Down" and played in a pickup football
league. Work at the camp was tedious, but his superiors tried to keep
morale high.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though we couldn't go off the island to get away, we could
still kick back," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Funaro said the guards work in eight-hour shifts, providing
detainees with food, toilet articles and showers. The guards live
nearby in what is called Camp America. The 12-man cottages are
plywood structures, similar to a beach house, with the added luxury
of air-conditioning.</TE>
<TE>   The prisoners eat well, and many have gained 15 pounds in
captivity, Funaro said. Medical care is abundant. But security is the
top priority.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't detect any real frustration on the part of them," Funaro
said. "We didn't have that many problems with them. They were kind of
resigned to what was going on."</TE>
<TE>   The guards often sit in during interrogations, but the discussions
are rarely in English.</TE>
<TE>   On the way back to their cells, the detainees "would just make
idle chitchat" in broken English, Funaro said.</TE>
<TE>   Army Sgt. 1st Class John Lombard managed a company of 80 military
police officers for the first six months of this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of [the prisoners] are older," he said, "and there are
people without legs, some who lost their legs in the war. Some may
have been soldiers like us and got caught up in the mess. Quite a few
others might have been pretty bad guys."</TE>
<TE>   But Staff Sgt. Ryan Foraker apparently will not be going home.</TE>
<TE>   His wife recently visited the base, viewed the crevice where they
discovered his clothes and attended a candlelight vigil at the base
chapel.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess part of me feels they probably won't find him," she said.
"So if nothing else, I wanted to say goodbye to him, so I too can
move on."</TE>

<HD>Status Quo Prevails in States' Ballot Measures</HD>

<LD>Three of the boldest measures facing voters across the country were
rejected Tuesday: Nevada refused to legalize marijuana, Oregon
rejected universal health coverage and South Dakota wouldn't let
jurors take the law into their own hands.</LD>
<LD>   In Washington state, a monorail system won financing approval from
Seattle voters, while North Dakota voters rejected paying college
graduates to remain in their state.</LD>
<LD>   And in six measures across the nation addressing issues of animal
protection, voters in five states rallied for the animals.</LD>
<TE>   In the most striking measures -- involving marijuana, health care
and law enforcement -- voters came down on the side of the
establishment.</TE>
<TE>   In Nevada, police complained they had little money to battle a
campaign to allow possession of up to three ounces of marijuana.
Nonetheless, voters resoundingly defeated the proposal that would
have made Nevada the first state in the nation to allow recreational
pot smoking.</TE>
<TE>   Voters in Arizona rejected a proposal to lessen the crime for
possession of small amounts of marijuana, and South Dakota voters
opposed allowing farmers to grow hemp for industrial purposes. Law
enforcement argued that because hemp so closely resembles marijuana
plants, the job of busting pot farms would be all the more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to establish a
$20-billion health care plan for everyone -- which would have made
Oregon the first state in the nation to provide full medical coverage
for all.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the ballot initiative's popular appeal, opponents argued
that there would be catastrophic fiscal fallout for the state if it
passed.</TE>
<TE>   Voters in South Dakota declared that the law's the law and should
not be changed by jurors. In strong numbers, they rejected a measure
that would have allowed juries to nullify state criminal laws if they
consider them unfair while weighing the guilt of a defendant.</TE>
<TE>   Animals fared well Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In Florida, voters adopted a measure to ban the use of cages to
contain pregnant pigs in the state's industrial hog farms, calling it
cruel and inhumane, while cockfighting was prohibited by voters in
Oklahoma, even though the state Legislature has repeatedly refused to
outlaw the sport.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas voters, however, were soundly defeating a measure that
would have made cruelty to an animal a felony rather than a
misdemeanor. The measure said animal cruelty "cannot be tolerated in
a civilized society."</TE>
<TE>   Georgia voters adopted a specialty license plate to finance spay
and neuter campaigns, while in Arizona, voters were rejecting a
measure to expand gambling at greyhound racing tracks.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Seattle residents have campaigned for an expanded
monorail system through downtown to help ease traffic congestion, and
on Tuesday voters approved a plan to finance a $1.7-billion project
through increased vehicle license fees.</TE>
<TE>   To stem the flow of college graduates fleeing North Dakota, voters
there considered whether to reimburse them up to $5,000 in college
tuition -- and offer a $5,000 tax credit over five years -- if the
students found employment in the state. In early returns, the
proposal was trailing.</TE>
<TE>   Voters in two states were split on whether to banish bilingual
education programs in favor of full-immersion English instruction. In
Massachusetts, English won over Spanish by about a 2-1 margin, while
voters in Colorado were turning down a similar proposal.</TE>
<TE>   In past years, California and Arizona had rejected bilingual
education; Massachusetts becomes the third state to do it.</TE>

<HD>Minnesotans Wait Through the Night for Senate Outcome</HD>
<DH>GOP's Coleman leads Democrat Mondale with many precincts
yet to be counted. Heavy turnout and late ballot change delay count.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Slater</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>The most unusual and perhaps most-watched Senate race in the country
brought out record numbers of voters Tuesday, which combined with a
hastily reworked ballot to keep the outcome a mystery as of early
this morning.</LD>
<LD>   Republican Norm Coleman, a former mayor of this city, led Democrat
Walter F. Mondale, a former senator and vice president under Jimmy
Carter. But many of the largest precincts had not finished counting,
several of them Democratic strongholds. Independence Party candidate
Jim Moore picked up most of the remaining votes.</LD>
<LD>   Mondale was drafted just over a week ago after the incumbent,
Democrat Paul Wellstone, died Oct. 25 in a plane crash along with his
wife, daughter, three staff members and two pilots. Election
officials created separate ballots for the Senate race -- ballots
that had to be counted by hand.</LD>
<TE>   "It's going to take a very long time to count these votes,"
Coleman told reporters Tuesday evening. "I'm tempted to go and rent
'Spider-Man' and watch the movie. And when it's done we'll probably
still be counting votes."</TE>
<TE>   "In Minnesota we might have broken all records for voter
participation," Mondale told supporters as some precincts reported
turnouts of upward of 85%. Election officials may have to count the
ballots again if the final tally is close. The hand count and other
problems, including lines so long that polls were forced to stay open
late and reports of some polling stations running out of ballots,
raised the possibility that this race -- like the 2000 presidential
contest in Florida -- could be headed for the courts.</TE>
<TE>   The winning candidate would take the seat held by Wellstone, the
Senate's lone-wolf liberal, a man who seemed happiest when he
represented the 1 in a 99-1 vote. He was locked in a bitter, often
negative fight with Coleman, 53, a former Democrat who switched
parties in 1996 while he was mayor. Coleman decided to run for the
Senate at the urging of President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone lagged behind Coleman for much of the campaign but had
pulled even when he died, according to most polls. Mondale stepped in
and, in a few days of relatively leisurely stumping, pulled to within
striking distance of Coleman, who had been on the campaign trail for
15 months.</TE>
<TE>   "Not everyone could have fit the bill," said Robin Hellmer, a
Mondale volunteer, as she helped fortify other helpers with gyros and
sodas Tuesday afternoon at the Union Labor Center in Minneapolis.
"He's Walter Mondale. Look at his credentials. He's perfect."</TE>
<TE>   Mondale, a former ambassador to Japan in addition to having served
as senator and vice president, was viewed by many here as the only
person who could seriously challenge Coleman so late in the race. He
even came with his own advertising; "Walter F. Mondale Hall" is
spelled out in giant gold letters across the main building at the
University of Minnesota Law School, right in downtown Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   A portrait, taken when he was vice president, smiles down at
students in the common area.</TE>
<TE>   "I would rather have a good representative for our state than
someone who wins because they campaigned for a long time," Rebecca
Berg, 26, a third-year student who had just cast her vote for
Mondale, said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Berg's choice was clearly that of the majority in Mondale Hall,
but 27-year-old Steve Scrogham had no qualms about dismissing
Minnesota's elder statesman.</TE>
<TE>   "The policies Mondale proposed in the '70s are the same ones he's
proposing today," said Hall before launching into a detailed argument
for why the Republicans need to wrest control of the Senate. "Mondale
will offer me an ideal and then tell me why it can't be achieved.
Coleman will say, 'We didn't get everything we wanted, but here's
what we did get.' "</TE>
<TE>   The brief Mondale-versus-Coleman campaign had just two milestones.
The first came when a memorial for Wellstone turned into a spirited
-- some thought unseemly -- campaign-style event. The other came
during their one debate, Monday, when Mondale charged hard at
Coleman, who had adopted a very low-key and respectful style since
Wellstone's death.</TE>
<TE>   The raucous memorial, many believe, invigorated Republicans, which
in turn may have charged up Democrats. Which candidate gained the
most from the debate was also unclear.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that either of them did anything during the debate
that swayed those crucial undecided voters one way or the other --
and if they did, I don't know which way those undecided voters
swung," said Lilly Goren, chair of the political science department
at the College of St. Catherine here.</TE>
<TE>   All of which contributed to heavy, perhaps record, turnouts and a
spirited midterm election day.</TE>
<TE>   Lines had formed at hundreds of polling stations around the state
before the doors opened at 7 a.m., and many voters in the Twin Cities
waited 30 minutes or more to cast their ballots.</TE>
<TE>   The weather turned so nasty it thwarted what would have been
Coleman's final campaign-trail push, an airborne odyssey around
Minnesota that would have bucked conventional political wisdom, which
says: If you haven't persuaded them by the time the polls open, you
aren't going to.</TE>
<TE>   With the death of Wellstone fresh in their minds, some in both
camps were relieved when Coleman was grounded..</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want another plane crash," said a Mondale volunteer.</TE>

<HD>Justices Signal Support for 3-Strikes Law</HD>
<DH>Based on questions, a challenge to California
repeat-offender statute faces long odds in the U.S. Supreme Court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>California's three-strikes law, the nation's harshest measure for
repeat criminal offenders, came under challenge at the Supreme Court
on Tuesday -- but it appeared to have more defenders than critics
among the justices.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is whether the state can send petty thieves to prison for
life or whether such an extreme penalty for a minor crime amounts to
cruel and unusual punishment, which is banned by the 8th Amendment.</LD>
<LD>   Eight years ago, California voters approved the three-strikes law
in reaction to the murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas by Richard Allen
Davis, a twice-convicted kidnapper who was free on parole.</LD>
<TE>   The ballot measure said those who commit three "serious" or
"violent" felonies will be kept behind bars. In practice, however,
the law allows prosecutors to win life terms for repeat criminals
whose third offense is neither violent nor serious.</TE>
<TE>   The high court debated two such cases Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 4, 1995, Leondro Andrade -- an Army veteran, father of
three and heroin addict -- went to a Kmart store in Ontario and
stuffed five children's videotapes in his pants.</TE>
<TE>   He was caught in the parking lot and charged with shoplifting. Two
weeks later, he committed nearly the same offense at a different
Kmart and was apprehended just as quickly.</TE>
<TE>   At his sentencing hearing, San Bernardino County prosecutors noted
that he had been convicted of three home burglaries a decade earlier.
He also had drug possession charges on his record. Invoking the
three-strikes law, the judge sent Andrade to prison for 50 years. He
will be eligible for parole when he turns 87.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Gary Ewing, another repeat offender, walked out of
the pro shop at an El Segundo golf course with three Callaway clubs
tucked into his pants leg.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, he was spotted in the parking lot, arrested,
charged with grand theft and, under the three-strikes law, given a 25
years-to-life sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said a life
prison term for a petty theft was unconstitutional; but most of the
Supreme Court justices signaled Tuesday that they did not share that
view.</TE>
<TE>   "Why can't California decide, 'Enough is enough,' that someone
with a long history of crimes deserves to be put away?" said Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist, echoing the state's argument.</TE>
<TE>   In their brief, California prosecutors maintained that "6% of the
criminal population commits 60% to 70% of all crime." More than 7,000
criminals have been sent to prison for life under the three-strikes
law. Of these, 344 were sent away for a petty theft, and they were
the focus of Tuesday's debate.</TE>
<TE>   California Deputy Atty. Gen. Donald DeNicola said the state is
reducing crime by locking up those who are crime-prone. "The state is
moving away from rehabilitation and moving toward a tougher policy of
incapacitation," he said. "And the judiciary ought to defer to the
states."</TE>
<TE>   But the two defense lawyers argued that the court should focus on
whether the punishment fits the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this is a grossly disproportionate punishment, a life
sentence for stealing three golf clubs," said Quin Denvir, a public
defender in Sacramento who represented Ewing.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the court has said the Constitution forbids
punishments that are grossly disproportionate to the crime. But
Rehnquist and Scalia, among others, dissented in those cases, and it
is not clear that the current majority adheres to the earlier view.</TE>
<TE>   "There has to be some limit," Denvir said. Jaywalking cannot be
the basis for sending someone to prison for life, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Jaywalking doesn't hurt other people," interjected Justice David
H. Souter, unlike burglaries and shoplifting.</TE>
<TE>   Souter said Ewing had nine convictions on his record before
stealing the golf clubs. The 25-year term may seem unreasonable for
the single theft, but not so if the entire record is taken into
account.</TE>
<TE>   USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky, who represented Andrade,
stressed that his client had no record of violence.</TE>
<TE>   California calls for up to eight years in prison for a rape and up
to 11 years for manslaughter, he said. Yet Andrade received 50 years
for stealing the videotapes because he had the burglaries on his
record.</TE>
<TE>   "This is that rare case" that deserves to be reversed as
unconstitutional, he said. "If there is any punishment that is cruel
and unusual, this is it. It is cruel and unique."</TE>
<TE>   But he ran into trouble with Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and
Souter, two of the court's more liberal members.</TE>
<TE>   They pointed to the 1996 law that made it harder for federal
judges to reverse state convictions. Unless the state has violated
"clearly established" federal law, judges should not intervene, the
law says.</TE>
<TE>   And Ginsburg said the Supreme Court's past rulings have not set a
clear rule. "There are lots of grand pronouncements [in past
decisions], but most of them end up rejecting the claims," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ginsburg said California's state judges cannot be faulted for
upholding Andrade's 50-year prison term, since the constitutional
rule in this area is not clearly established.</TE>
<TE>   Only Justices John Paul Stevens and Stephen G. Breyer disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   Breyer said that a life term is usually reserved for the most
serious crimes, such as murder or an airplane hijacking.</TE>
<TE>   "This is higher by a factor of two or three times" than the usual
maximum for thefts, he said. "There must be a way of saying when the
state has gone too far."</TE>
<TE>   Stevens wondered whether the state could impose a life prison term
on someone who had several speeding tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, possibly so, DeNicola replied.</TE>
<TE>   Does it matter that Andrade was not charged with a violent
offense, Stevens asked.</TE>
<TE>   No, said Douglas Danzig, a California deputy attorney. But Andrade
had been convicted of home burglaries, and "there is a potential for
danger and violence whenever someone breaks into a home," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The justices will vote behind closed doors this week and then
begin work on opinions. Rulings in the two cases can be expected in
several months.</TE>

<HD>Suspects May Be Linked to Tucson Shooting</HD>
<DH>Authorities are investigating the sniper death of a golfer
in March. A magistrate in Maryland rejects bail for Muhammad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Vartabedian and Stephen Braun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Authorities said Tuesday they are investigating whether alleged
serial snipers John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo killed a man on
a Tucson golf course in March after arriving from Los Angeles -- the
first indication the pair had been in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   If the pair are linked to the Tucson slaying, it would extend the
reach of their alleged killing spree to almost every corner of the
nation. They have been linked to 17 shootings, 13 of them fatal, in
Virginia, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Alabama, Louisiana and
the state of Washington. Police are investigating the suspects in
three other shootings, for a total of 20 crime scenes.</LD>
<LD>   Tucson Police Chief Richard Miranda said that golfer Jerry R.
Taylor, 60, was shot March 19 with a high-powered rifle, though no
bullet was recovered from the body and no witnesses have been found.
An autopsy disclosed that Taylor's wound was consistent with the
tissue damage caused by the type of sniper rifle allegedly used by
Muhammad and Malvo, Miranda said.</LD>
<TE>   FBI officials have placed the pair in Tucson from March 13 to
March 25, based on passenger manifests from bus lines. The two
arrived in Tucson from Los Angeles, FBI officials told Miranda.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Don Hartwell, a senior homicide detective with the Los Angeles
Police Department, said LAPD investigators have not linked any
slayings to the two. But Los Angeles has recorded 563 killings this
year, leaving many cases to consider.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad and Malvo traveled to Tucson to visit Muhammad's sister,
Odessa Newell, who was stationed at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base,
Miranda said. They told her they were leaving March 16 when she
dropped them off at a bus station, but passenger manifests show they
did not leave until March 25, Miranda said. She has since moved to
New Orleans and might go by the name Odessa Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, law enforcement officials in Maryland said Tuesday
that it appears the Sony laptop computer stolen in a Sept. 5 shooting
at a Prince George's County liquor store is the same one recovered
from Muhammad's Chevrolet Caprice.</TE>
<TE>   The serial number on the laptop had been scratched off, but FBI
computer experts were able to trace the laptop by examining its hard
drive, an official said. The Sept. 5 shooting has been linked by
ballistic evidence to one that occurred 10 days later, and the
official said the laptop could tie the suspects to the earlier
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials, meanwhile, said they were getting
closer to deciding which jurisdiction would prosecute the two
suspects first. They will face their first trial in either federal
court in Maryland or state court in Virginia, an official said.
Prosecutors from a number of offices met Tuesday to discuss the
decision.</TE>
<TE>   But a public defender representing Muhammad questioned the
strength of the government's case against the sniper suspects, saying
that prosecutors' reliance on a seized extortion note amounted to "a
stretch" to support a federal indictment.</TE>
<TE>   During a detention hearing in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt,
Md., James Wyda, a federal public defender, said an extortion note
recovered Oct. 19 by police near a Virginia shooting scene was weak
evidence on which to mount a federal murder case because all but one
shooting had already occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "This is no longer a murder case," Wyda said outside the
courtroom. "This is an extortion case. They can't prove extortion.
They can't meet their burden of proof in making this a federal case."</TE>
<TE>   But a federal magistrate agreed with prosecutors to keep Muhammad
in detention because he represents a "danger to the community" and a
"flight risk."</TE>
<TE>   "There is probable cause to believe the defendant participated in
a series of multiple murders," said U.S. Chief Magistrate Jillyn K.
Schulze, who ordered Muhammad held without bail.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing at the hearing in a magenta jumpsuit, Muhammad said
nothing, flexing his hands after U.S. marshals removed his manacles.
Muhammad seemed more alert than he had during his first arraignment
last month.</TE>
<TE>   Wyda characterized the sniper suspect's extortion note that
demanded $10 million as "crackpot, insane." Without it, he said, the
federal government has a case built only on circumstantial evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "The government's case has significant problems," Wyda said,
noting that neither police nor prosecutors had produced any
eyewitness accounts of the shootings. "There's no direct evidence
that Mr. Muhammad was at the scene of any of these crimes."</TE>
<TE>   Both the Justice Department and the U.S. attorney in Baltimore,
Thomas M. DiBiagio, are actively considering charging Muhammad with
murder under the Hobbs Act, a federal statute that allows for the
prosecution of murder if a homicide was committed during an extortion
attempt.</TE>
<TE>   A guilty verdict could lead to a federal death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   James Trusty, an assistant U.S. attorney for the southern district
of Maryland, raised the possibility of the death sentence as a
compelling reason for Muhammad to be kept in custody.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to show that Muhammad has a history of fabricating his
past, the prosecutor also detailed several aliases and false
identification papers that Muhammad has allegedly used. Trusty said
Muhammad had used the names Wayne Weeks, Wayne Weekley, Charles
Douglas and Thomas Lee. Each of the names had a different, false
birth date, ranging from December 1960 to December 1970, Trusty said.</TE>
<TE>   Antiguan government documents obtained Tuesday by The Times
bolstered Trusty's statements about Muhammad's use of a "Thomas Lee"
alias.</TE>
<TE>   The records indicate that Muhammad used the name "Thomas Allen
Lee" when he arrived in Antigua on March 28, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   On an arrival card filled out aboard a plane bound for Antigua,
Muhammad declared that he was born in Harrisburg, Pa., and cited his
profession as "car repair."</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad used a Wyoming driver's license under the Lee name as
proof. And the documents also indicate that Muhammad used the Lee
name as aliases for the three children he brought into the country
with him.</TE>
<TE>   "He used various names at various times," Trusty said, adding that
federal investigators had been unable to find a "fixed address" for
the suspect.</TE>

<KH>National Results</KH>
<HD>Networks, Voters Forced to Wait for Count as Exit Poll
System Collapses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Voters and candidates anxious for early results from Tuesday's
elections were left hanging like chads when a key system used to
predict winners broke down.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, a nation accustomed to hearing the television
networks predict winners as soon as the polls close was forced to do
something unusual in the age of instant information: wait for ballots
to be counted.</LD>
<LD>   Voter News Service, the media consortium that conducts the exit
polling used by the networks and Associated Press to project winners,
said it "was not satisfied with the accuracy of today's exit poll
analysis."</LD>
<TE>   The decision not to release the data meant that many voters went
to bed Tuesday night not knowing who had won a number of closely
fought House and Senate races.</TE>
<TE>   The snafu was the latest for a system that suffered a major
embarrassment -- and came under scrutiny during congressional
hearings -- after making the wrong calls in Florida in the 2000
presidential election. Networks used the VNS data to announce the
election first for Al Gore, then for George W. Bush, finally saying
it was too close to call.</TE>
<TE>   This year's breakdown in the VNS system forced executives,
producers and anchors in network newsrooms to scramble to implement
backup plans for the night's election programming.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no sin in actually counting votes," said CNN anchor Aaron
Brown. "So if we all have to hang back and see what actually
happened, there's inherent drama in that too."</TE>
<TE>   "It's actually kind of refreshing," said David King, a Harvard
University professor of public policy who has studied the VNS
operation. "It makes the election experience more genuine. Now, they
actually have to wait for real numbers, as opposed to statistical
samples from questionable sources."</TE>
<TE>   Marty Ryan, executive producer of political programming for Fox
News Channel, said his network had conducted telephone polling Monday
and Tuesday in 10 battleground states. That, along with historical
data and the vote count as it came in Tuesday, helped analysts make
projections.</TE>
<TE>   But without the VNS exit poll, he said, "we've been a little bit
slower and more deliberate." The exit polls not only identify whom
voters cast their ballots for but provide information about voters
that help analysts call an election.</TE>
<TE>   "In 2000, we took heat -- and rightfully so because we projected
incorrectly," said Barbara Levin, communications director for NBC
News. "In 2002, we're taking our time because we want to get it
right."</TE>
<TE>   A representative of each of the media outlets that make up VNS --
Fox, ABC, NBC, CBS, Associated Press and CNN -- learned about the
problem Tuesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "We got the report from the statisticians that the computers were
having problems compiling the votes," said Bill Wheatley, vice
president of NBC News. "There was no debate, even. We just said no."</TE>
<TE>   VNS had dispatched 30,000 staffers to precincts all over the
country, armed with a toll-free phone number to VNS headquarters in
Brooklyn, N.Y., and a schedule to call in three times with fresh
data. Their accounts from precincts in schools, homes and firehouses
were fed into the system. But the analysis didn't look right, said
Ted Savaglio, VNS executive director.</TE>
<TE>   "If a number looks much larger than it's ever been in the past,
then you know," he said. "You have expectations and some basis on
which to base the results."</TE>
<TE>   In the days leading up to the election, VNS had been consistent
and clear that its goal was to be bug-free by the presidential
election in 2004. VNS representatives candidly said that if things
went smoothly on this election day, it would be a bonus -- but they
weren't counting on it.</TE>
<TE>   "We were prepared for the possibility that the processing and
compilation of the exit poll data would not be satisfactory in order
for us to publish," Savaglio said.</TE>
<TE>   ABC News executives actually planned for VNS to stumble.</TE>
<TE>   "In anticipation of this, we relied on our own field reports and
Associated Press tabulation of raw vote," said spokeswoman Cathie
Levine. "Our goal all night was to be 100% accurate and reliable."</TE>
<TE>   CBS also planned its coverage more cautiously.</TE>
<TE>   "We have known that with VNS halfway through a four-year complete
overhaul that this was a possibility, so we planned accordingly,"
said CBS News spokeswoman Sandy Genelius. "VNS was always going to be
one tool we were going to use on election night, but we still have
plenty of others."</TE>
<TE>   At the bunting-bedecked CNN newsroom in Atlanta, the breakdown in
the VNS exit poll system was "breaking news."</TE>
<TE>   Out the window were plans to open each hour of programming with
projected winners, based on the exit poll data. Producers who
normally would have been crunching the data to discern trends in
preparation for the first poll closings were unusually calm.</TE>
<TE>   CNN relied on a backup system of more than 600 workers it
stationed at a sampling of precincts in 10 key states to report as
vote counts were posted.</TE>
<TE>   "I love election night," exclaimed CNN News Group Chairman Walter
Isaacson. "This makes life more interesting, and there's an upside:
We get to wait for the counting of real votes and watch elections
unfold. I think it will be educational for the nation."</TE>

<HD>Davis Is Facing Tough Problems on His Own</HD>
<DH>With few allies in the Legislature, he will immediately
encounter difficult choices on the budget -- raise taxes or cut
programs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Finnegan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After an election in which voters voiced deep dissatisfaction with
his leadership, Gov. Gray Davis enters his second term with neither
strong public support nor a well-defined mandate.</LD>
<LD>   Many of those who cast ballots on Tuesday did so despite
reservations about his job performance. Davis also campaigned without
much of a platform, focusing instead on tearing down his Republican
challenger, Bill Simon Jr.</LD>
<LD>   Now, having governed for the last four years without many allies
in the Legislature, Davis enters his second term facing tough
problems without strong supporters.</LD>
<TE>   "The minute he's sworn in, he's a lame-duck, term-limited
incumbent, and it's going to be -- to some degree -- more difficult
to hold people in line," said Garry South, the governor's top
political strategist.</TE>
<TE>   The most immediate trouble for Davis is the state's fiscal mess --
a looming budget shortfall that most experts predict will easily top
$10 billion. He will soon be forced to choose between raising taxes
and cutting billions of dollars in spending, much of it on popular
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is certain to face fierce resistance in the Legislature,
both from Republicans who refuse to raise taxes and Democrats who
oppose program cuts.</TE>
<TE>   But the battle over state money is only the most visible of the
difficulties the centrist governor can expect in working with a
polarized Legislature that became even more so Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the second term is going to be a bed of roses,"
South said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis leads a state with substandard public schools, overcrowded
freeways and uncertain water supplies. California also continues to
feel the aftereffects of the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   In his campaign for reelection, Davis offered little in the way of
an agenda that he can now press in his second term. To win, he
attacked Simon with television ads depicting the Republican as an
untrustworthy and incompetent businessman.</TE>
<TE>   In spots promoting himself, Davis looked backward, not forward,
boasting of higher school test scores, more health coverage for
children and other first-term advances. It was only at the end of the
race that Davis ran an ad promising to pursue more of the same in his
second term.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that we've even had a clear message from him on what
he wants to do for the next four years, other than continuing the
things he's done so far," said Larry N. Gerston, a political science
professor at San Jose State.</TE>
<TE>   But for any programs that cost money -- among them the health
insurance for kids -- Davis is hamstrung by the state's dismal fiscal
outlook. This year, it was only after a two-month political stalemate
that Davis and the Legislature cobbled together a plan to close a
record budget gap of nearly $24 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Next year could be worse. For now, the state's estimated revenue
shortfall is more than $10 billion, but analysts expect it to grow. A
projected economic turnaround has not occurred. And the fiscal tricks
used last year to balance the books -- spending postponement, fund
transfers and the like -- now are just about exhausted, making a tax
hike or big spending cuts all but inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's results were likely only to further hobble Davis as he
confronts that issue. A ballot initiative to expand before- and
after-school programs -- at a cost of up to $550 million a year --
was leading in early returns and could further constrain the state's
options for balancing the budget.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of the campaign, Davis refused to say how he would
resolve the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Gerston said the outcome was inevitable: "He's going to preside
over the largest tax increase in recent memory. This has to be the
worst-kept secret in the world."</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans resisted the tax hike ultimately enacted this year
and have no incentive to be less steadfast next year.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats retain solid majorities in both houses of the
Legislature, but the budget requires a two-thirds vote, so a handful
of Republicans must consent to any tax hike.</TE>
<TE>   "Republicans are not going to sit still for a tax increase," said
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political science professor at USC. "They
don't have to."</TE>
<TE>   Pressure for a tax hike will come not just from Democrats, but
also from organized labor, a major supporter of the governor's
reelection effort. Art Pulaski, executive secretary treasurer of the
California Labor Federation, said unions will seek a tax hike on the
rich to avoid cuts elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't cut any more," Pulaski said. Advocating that view will
be a strengthened caucus of liberal Democrats dominating both houses
of the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   In several districts around the state, liberal Democrats and
conservative Republicans defeated moderate opponents in the March
primary, then went on to win the election Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The deepening polarization of the Legislature is the result in
part of a redistricting plan -- approved by representatives of both
parties -- that created more solidly partisan districts, making it
possible for more ideological candidates to prevail.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves liberals prepared to fight to protect programs and
conservatives ready to battle against tax hikes.</TE>
<TE>   For Davis, a staunch moderate already unpopular among state
lawmakers -- even within his own party -- the sharp divide within the
Legislature portends trouble beyond the budget.</TE>
<TE>   Even his advisors acknowledge that the coming months will test the
governor. South said Davis "will have to keep the Legislature from
trying to roll over him like a bus coming down the road" with liberal
legislation -- and could risk his first veto override.</TE>
<TE>   Another potential thorn for Davis is the cadre of Democrats in
other statewide elected offices, nearly all of whom are potential
candidates for governor in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Among them, according to early returns Tuesday, could be John
Garamendi, the insurance commissioner candidate who ran for governor
in 1994; state Atty Gen. Bill Lockyer; Treasurer Phil Angelides; and
Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante. All of those officials were leading in
early returns Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   To break away from the pack, strategists said, any one of them
could try to embarrass the governor the way state Controller Kathleen
Connell did by criticizing him during her 2001 campaign for mayor of
Los Angeles. Already, Bustamante has run television ads portraying
himself as courageous for speaking out against a Davis administration
software procurement scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "They might all start ganging up against Davis, because talk is
cheap," said GOP strategist Arnold Steinberg.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, it is not just the environment around Davis that
is changing. Davis himself enters the new term with an unfamiliar
worldview.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, Davis has climbed the state political ladder, running
for higher office time and again. Now, under term limits, Davis
cannot run again for governor, so his march through the state
political ranks is complete.</TE>
<TE>   He could run for president or seek to replace Democratic Sen.
Dianne Feinstein if she decides not to seek reelection in 2006. Or he
could govern with an eye toward his legacy rather than toward the
next campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "It does provide him with an opportunity -- if he really wanted to
-- to become an elder statesman," Steinberg said. "The question is,
what will be the last thing he wants to be remembered for?"</TE>

<LD>Green Party gubernatorial hopeful Peter Miguel Camejo was the prime
beneficiary of voters' discontent with California's two major-party
candidates, polling better than even he expected and giving a boost,
he said, to future Green campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   Third-party candidates had their best showing in a California
election since 1934. Although still polling in the single digits in
early returns, and well behind Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and
Republican Bill Simon Jr., Camejo was the clear leader among the
second tier.</LD>
<LD>   "What we are seeing is a true protest vote," said veteran
political consultant Rick Taylor. "People are saying it's time for a
real change. It should be a wake-up call to the major-party
candidates."</LD>
<TE>   Preparing to address about 125 supporters gathered at the
University of Creation Spirituality in Oakland on Tuesday evening,
Camejo said the returns were "beyond anything we expected."</TE>
<TE>   "I am surprised by the degree that the Latino community is
breaking from the Democratic Party," Camejo said. "There is a feeling
of betrayal by Davis."</TE>
<TE>   From the start of his campaign, Camejo, 62, said he had no
illusion that he would become California's next governor, but he
relished the threat his candidacy could pose to Davis by peeling off
liberal voters.</TE>
<TE>   He bluntly said he was unconcerned about the possibility of
tipping the election in favor of Simon. "The Democrats whine about
Greens running. Why shouldn't people feel free to vote for who they
want?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was hopeful that the results would boost the Green
Party's clout in state elections. "We believe we will soon have
people winning legislative seats," Camejo said.</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York to one of Venezuela's wealthiest families, Camejo
became an activist while attending Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, where he enrolled in 1958. He dropped out to march for
civil rights with Martin Luther King Jr. and, later, to organize
against the Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   Like many radicals during the 1960s, Camejo found his way to UC
Berkeley, where his role in campus activism convinced then-Gov.
Ronald Reagan to brand him "one of the most dangerous men in
America."</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, Camejo ran for president on the Socialist ticket, winning
91,314 votes.</TE>

<HD>Hospital Funding Plan Passes</HD>
<DH>Partial returns show ballot measure for L.A. County medical
facilities has two-thirds majority. Museum upgrade plan falls short.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Richardson and Charles Ornstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A ballot proposition to pump $168 million per year into Los Angeles
County emergency rooms and trauma centers easily surpassed the
two-thirds majority needed to pass, according to a majority of
returns Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   But a $250-million bond measure to upgrade cultural facilities
fell short of the required two-thirds.</LD>
<LD>   That failed proposal, Measure A, would have provided $250 million
for renovations at the county's art and natural history museums, and
for construction at a handful of other cultural institutions. The
goal was to help the facilities comply with earthquake and fire
safety standards.</LD>
<TE>   The hospital proposal, called Measure B, will raise property taxes
by 3 cents per square foot, or about $42 for a 1,400-square-foot
house. In addition to funding emergency rooms and trauma centers, the
money will be used for bioterrorism preparedness.</TE>
<TE>   Measure B supporters said the money is needed to stave off the
closing of two public hospitals -- Harbor-UCLA and Olive View-UCLA
medical centers -- which were threatened by a looming deficit.
Proponents are also hoping to entice hospitals in Pomona, the
Antelope Valley and eastern San Gabriel Valley to provide trauma
services where none currently exist.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky claimed victory late
Tuesday, but acknowledged he hadn't thought several months ago that
it had a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an incredible statement by the people of Los Angeles County
that health care matters, that trauma and emergency care matter," he
said. "It changes the dynamic of the whole Los Angeles County health
care debate." As funding from the state has dried up, the number of
trauma centers in Los Angeles County has dropped from 22 in 1985 to
13. If additional trauma centers close, people with severe injuries
would have to travel farther to get care.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of Measure B raised about $2 million, mostly from the
Service Employees International Union, whose members' jobs would have
been in jeopardy if hospitals closed.</TE>
<TE>   The difficulty, supporters said, was getting people to appreciate
the scope of the problem. Opponents of Measure B contended that the
burden of funding trauma care should rest with the state, not with
county taxpayers. They also criticized the plan because it is
open-ended, and taxes can be increased each year to keep pace with
inflation.</TE>
<TE>   Critics did not mount an advertising campaign, but rather placed
their faith in a requirement that the new tax needed approval from
two-thirds of voters. That requirement, imposed in 1978 by
Proposition 13, has made it difficult to win approval for tax
increases.</TE>
<TE>   The passage of the hospital measure will help shape discussions
today between county supervisors and a top federal health official,
Tom Scully, who is visiting the county to discuss a request for an
unlikely $1.4-billion bailout.</TE>
<TE>   Scully, administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid
Services, is to tour Harbor and Olive View. Supervisors had planned
to vote Nov. 19 to close both hospitals if the measure didn't pass
and if the federal and state governments didn't pledge more money.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Measure B, Measure A called for a one-time bond issue whose
proceeds would have had to be matched by private funds. The money
would have been spread among several building projects, but the bulk
-- $196 million -- would have been divided between the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles
County.</TE>
<TE>   Both institutions are in the early stages of dramatic renovation
plans that are expected to cost as much as $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative would have cost the owner of a $250,000 home an
additional $6.96 in taxes the first year, which would have declined
over the 30-year life of the bond.</TE>
<TE>   Before they could receive bond money, the museums would have had
to separately raise about $1.15 in private funds for every public
dollar. Also, both would have been required to increase their free
admissions to children and school groups by 50% over 2001-02 levels.</TE>
<TE>   Measure A supporters raised $4.9 million in contributions and
loans through late October. Opponents spent nothing, according to
county records.</TE>
<TE>   In the days leading up to the vote, Measure A advocates kept
images of cracked ceilings and potentially unstable buildings before
voters in TV spots. However, critics argued the bond issue was an
excuse for the museums to launch new projects.</TE>

<HD>Democrats Leading in Race for Attorney General, Treasurer</HD>
<DH>John Garamendi is ahead in bid to regain post as insurance
commissioner.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Morain</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Democrats led in balloting for attorney general, lieutenant governor
and most other down-ballot offices, while Republican Sen. Tom
McClintock and wealthy Democratic businessman Steve Westly were
locked in a tight race for controller.</LD>
<LD>   A Democrat, Sen. Jack O'Connell of San Luis Obispo, opened a wide
lead in the race for the nonpartisan post of superintendent of public
instruction, and former Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, trying
to mount a political comeback, was ahead in the contest for his old
job.Democrats were confident that they would win most if not all
so-called down-ballot statewide posts. If Republicans end up being
shut out or nearly shut out, the GOP would have little choice but to
look to an outsider such as actor Arnold Schwarzenegger to run for
governor in four years.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm gratified by the victory," Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said
Tuesday night. "It is a victory for people who care about
environmental protection, civil rights enforcement, and vigorous
efforts to chase the energy gougers and other corporate miscreants."</LD>
<TE>   Down-ballot offices attract relatively little public attention but
control vast areas of state government. The attorney general has the
power to bring consumer lawsuits on the state's behalf. The insurance
commissioner has authority over insurance rates.</TE>
<TE>   The posts also serve as steppingstones for higher office. Six of
the last eight governors served as lieutenant governor, secretary of
state or attorney general. Lockyer, Treasurer Phil Angelides and Lt.
Gov. Cruz Bustamante are contemplating running for governor in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   In this election, Lockyer and Angelides were so confident of
victory against their Republican foes, Sen. Dick Ackerman of Irvine
and accountant Greg Conlon, that they barely campaigned. Socking away
money for future statewide runs, Lockyer has $8.8 million in the bank
and Angelides has $7.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Bustamante faced a more serious challenge from Sen. Bruce
McPherson (R-Santa Cruz), and spent $2 million on his reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats' dominance is reflected by their campaign accounts.
Democrats seeking seven statewide offices other than governor amassed
a combined $20.2 million as of Oct. 19, the most recent filing.
Republicans had $2.1 million. Those Democrats spent $23.5 million on
their 2002 state campaigns. Republicans spent $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Republicans have a history of starving down-ticket candidates,"
said Kevin Spillane, consultant to Republican attorney Gary Mendoza,
who was trying to block former Insurance Commissioner Garamendi from
regaining his job.</TE>
<TE>   The state and national Republican Party did help Mendoza, a
moderate Latino attorney, infusing his campaign with $1.2 million.
Garamendi and Mendoza took no insurance industry donations. The last
elected insurance commissioner, Republican Chuck Quackenbush, was
forced to resign amid scandal.</TE>
<TE>   The next commissioner will face significant problems. Many
insurers refuse to write homeowners policies. Construction is being
slowed as contractors are having a hard time getting coverage.
Workers' compensation carriers are leaving the state.</TE>
<TE>   Garamendi served as the state's first elected insurance
commissioner, then failed in 1994 to win the Democratic nomination
for governor. He had been out of politics in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP gave six-figure donations to McPherson and former
Assemblyman Keith Olberg, running for secretary of state against
Assemblyman Kevin Shelley (D-San Francisco).</TE>
<TE>   Polls taken in the days before the balloting suggested that
McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), running for state controller, had the
best chance of winning. McClintock, who narrowly lost a race for
controller in 1994, ran his campaign for slightly more than $1
million.</TE>
<TE>   McClintock's opponent, Westly, is a wealthy former EBay executive
and longtime Democratic Party activist. A first-time candidate who
aspires to higher office, Westly spent more than $8 million to
capture the seat, including $5 million of his own money.</TE>
<TE>   Westly was not prepared to proclaim victory early today. But as
the seesaw vote count shifted to his favor after midnight, Westly
said, "It is looking great; we need to keep our fingers crossed."</TE>
<TE>   Despite holding office off and on for 20 years, McClintock has few
allies among fellow legislators. Viewed by lobbying groups as
contentious, McClintock collected only a few thousand dollars from
groups with issues pending in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell, a former high school teacher, built a significant lead
in the race for superintendent of public instruction over Republican
Katherine Smith, an Anaheim high school district board member. Supt.
Delaine Eastin must retire because of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell raised $6 million, much of it from the California
Teachers Assn. and the California Federation of Teachers. Smith
raised $138,000, with half coming by way of a personal loan.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell is known best for carrying legislation that reduced the
size of primary grade classes to 20 students. In his campaign, he
emphasized the need to expand class-size reduction to higher grades.</TE>
<TE>   "To assume the top education position is quite an honor, quite
humbling," O'Connell said Tuesday, pledging to press for more school
construction.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope students will look at this and see that if you set your
goals high, they can be realized," O'Connell said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Republican Party has been marginalized and is not
competitive," said Democratic consultant Darry Sragow. Latinos,
women, African Americans and men under 50 consistently are voting
Democratic, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "The Republican Party is not competitive because it is not selling
anything the marketplace wants, and that is because the marketplace
has changed," Sragow said.</TE>
<TE>   "The silver lining," said Republican consultant Dan Schnur, "and
it is a pretty thin one, is that Democrats will now be completely
accountable to the state's voters.... There is a lot of pain right
around the corner. Democrats will have no one to blame but
themselves."</TE>

<HD>Democrat Leads Race to Replace Condit</HD>
<DH>The GOP candidate also falls behind in the 39th District,
where Linda Sanchez is ahead and hoping to join her sister in the
House.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Merl</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In one of California's few competitive contests for Congress or the
Legislature, Democratic Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza appeared headed
for victory Tuesday in the closely watched race to replace Democratic
Rep. Gary Condit in the Central Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Democratic attorney Linda Sanchez took a solid lead in
the race to capture a new congressional seat in southeast Los Angeles
County.</LD>
<LD>   In a pivotal state Senate race, Republican Jeff Denham held the
lead over former Democratic Assemblyman Rusty Areias in the Central
Valley's 12th District. Though the seat is currently occupied by a
Republican, Democrats poured time and money into the district in
their quest to pick up the one seat they need to gain a two-thirds
majority in the upper house.</LD>
<TE>   A handful of Assembly races appeared close, but most contests held
little suspense and Democrats were expected to hold onto a
comfortable majority in that chamber.</TE>
<TE>   Dogged by scandal over his relationship with murdered intern
Chandra Levy, Condit lost the Democratic primary in March and set in
motion one of the state's fiercest campaigns. The race between
Cardoza (D-Merced), a former Condit aide, and state Sen. Dick
Monteith (R-Modesto) was regarded as one of a few close contests
around the nation that could help determine whether Republicans
maintained or strengthened their control of the House of
Representatives.</TE>
<TE>   Both parties poured vast amounts of money and other aid into the
district, where a Republican voter registration drive narrowed the
Democrats' edge.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats hold a clear advantage in the new 39th Congressional
District, where Sanchez faced Republican businessman Tim Escobar. The
seat was added to the California delegation after the 2000 census,
and was drawn to favor a Latino Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   A Sanchez victory would mark the first time related women have
served simultaneously in the House. Sanchez is the younger sister of
Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Garden Grove), whose connections and
fund-raising clout helped her sibling win a fierce Democratic
primary."My sister and I are hoping that we are a symbol of the
diversity to come in Congress," Linda Sanchez said at her election
night party in Lakewood. "I'm hoping this encourages women, people of
color and younger folks to run for office."</TE>
<TE>   In another notable local race, former Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dymally
ended his political retirement by defeating Republican Mark Anthony
Iles in the Compton-based 52nd Assembly District. Dymally began his
career in the Assembly in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   Dymally, an African American who retired as a congressman in 1992,
said he entered the race after he searched unsuccessfully for other
experienced candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a whole different political culture in Sacramento now --
a fast turnover and not a lot of experienced hands," Dymally said,
blaming term limits for the situation. He said he would concentrate
on legislation to help community colleges and also wants to address
health-care issues.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the state, the major parties fought particularly hard
for three open Assembly seats, including the 15th District in
Northern California and two in the southern end of the state.</TE>
<TE>   In inland San Diego County's 78th District, Republican Shirley
Horton, mayor of Chula Vista, was in a tight race with Democrat
Vincent Hall, a former aide to Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Bonnie Garcia, an aide to a state senator, was leading
Democrat Joey Acuna, a construction supervisor, in the 80th District,
which encompasses all of Imperial County and part of Riverside
County.</TE>
<TE>   But those close races were the exceptions. Most legislative and
congressional contests across California were all but decided well
before election day.</TE>
<TE>   That is because party leaders in the Legislature, charged with
redrawing political district boundaries last year, reached a deal
aimed at preserving the status quo.</TE>
<TE>   Districts held by Democrats were adjusted to maximize the election
prospects of Democratic candidates, and the same was true for
Republican-held districts. As a result, most of the real battles took
place during the primaries.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, challengers mounted strong attacks even in some
districts where incumbents had been aided by redistricting.</TE>
<TE>   The 23rd Congressional District, for example, was redrawn into a
long and narrow coastal sliver to improve the reelection chances of
Rep. Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara).</TE>
<TE>   But Republican challenger Beth Rogers, a Carpinteria
businesswoman, mounted a strong challenge and turned the race into
one of the state's most expensive House campaigns. A wealthy member
of a fourth-generation farming family, Rogers edged out Capps in
fund-raising, but personally contributed about half of the $1.44
million in her treasury. Capps was running ahead in a race in which
both were considered political moderates.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, who already have simple majorities in both the state
Senate and the Assembly, sought to extend their domination of both
houses. They needed one additional seat to attain a two-thirds
majority in the Senate and four more seats to reach that goal in the
Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   With two-thirds majorities in both houses and a Democrat in the
governor's office, the dominant party could pass a state budget and
other key legislation without Republican cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   Winning enough additional seats was considered a long shot,
however, in large part because of the redistricting that was designed
to keep the status quo: 25 Democrats to 15 Republicans in the Senate
and 50 Democrats to 30 Republicans in the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Although leaders of both parties embraced the redistricting, it
was roundly criticized by political scientists.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said the "incumbent protection plan," as the new political
maps were quickly labeled, ensured that political leaders, not the
voters, got to pick their elected officials and predicted it would
further erode public interest in elections.</TE>

<HD>'Living Wage' Trails in Early Santa Monica Voting</HD>
<DH>Widely watched plan would set minimum pay for service
workers. Riverside County voters extend a sales tax for road
projects.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A proposal in Santa Monica that would require some businesses to pay
a "living wage" to hotel maids and other service workers was trailing
in early returns Tuesday in a contest that drew the attention of
labor and business groups nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   Voters in Riverside County approved a proposal to extend a tax for
a massive road-building program.</LD>
<LD>   And in Ventura County, voters in four cities were taking up
growth-related measures, two sponsored by landowners and two by
anti-sprawl activists.</LD>
<TE>   Santa Monica's Measure JJ, the living wage ordinance, had the
backing of religious leaders, many of the state's top Democrats and
the Hotel Employees &amp; Restaurant Employees union. It was opposed by
hotels, restaurants and retailers, which contended that the measure
would chill the city's business climate and prompt businesses to go
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The ordinance would require businesses near the coast that bring
in more than $5 million in annual sales to pay their employees $10.50
an hour with health benefits and $12.25 an hour without.</TE>
<TE>   Foes viewed the measure as a thinly veiled attempt to force hotels
to unionize. Under the measure, the city's two unionized hotels would
be allowed to negotiate an exemption from the minimum wage mandated
by the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates said the measure would lift families out of poverty and
ease their reliance on food stamps and other programs.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides waged emotional campaigns clouded by charges of dirty
tricks. On Monday, residents received a mailer indicating that top
Democrats, such as Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), opposed the
measure when, in fact, they had endorsed it.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Monica, early returns were going against a proposal that
would dramatically alter the way council members and the mayor are
elected.</TE>
<TE>   The Voter Election Reform Initiative for a True Accountability
System, or Veritas, would replace the city's seven at-large council
members with district representatives, thus reducing the power of
slates driven by ideology.</TE>
<TE>   It would also require the direct election of the mayor (now chosen
by council members), institute a mayoral veto of council actions and
impose term limits on city officials.</TE>
<TE>   In Riverside County, the proposed 30-year, $4.6-billion extension
of a half-cent sales tax led from the earliest returns and held that
lead throughout the night.</TE>
<TE>   It needed more than two-thirds of the vote to pass.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters said the program, known as Measure A, would ease
gridlock in the Inland Empire and boost the economy by funding the
repair of roads and highways.</TE>
<TE>   The measure could pay for everything from fixing potholes to
expanding California 91, a thoroughfare that links the Inland Empire
with the rest of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, a national pacesetter in ballot-box growth
controls, voters were deciding the fate of four separate measures.</TE>
<TE>   Landowner-backed development initiatives in Ventura and Santa
Paula were widely expected to fail, but so were anti-sprawl measures
sponsored by citizen activists in Simi Valley and Ojai.</TE>

<HD>Bleak Political Landscape Awaits Governor</HD>
<DH>He will have difficulty claiming a mandate, and inherits a
looming budget shortfall that most experts predict will easily top
$10 billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Finnegan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With their attention focused on attacking one another, Gov. Gray
Davis and his Republican challenger, Bill Simon Jr., paid scant
attention to laying out an agenda for running the state.</LD>
<LD>   Now the winner -- whether Simon or the Democratic incumbent --
faces a bleak political landscape. Since both campaigned without much
of a platform, the winner will have difficulty claiming a mandate,
particularly given that so many of those who cast ballots Tuesday did
so with reservations about the candidates.</LD>
<LD>   The winner of the race begins by inheriting the state's fiscal
mess -- a looming budget shortfall that most experts predict will
easily top $10 billion. He will soon be forced to choose between
raising taxes or cutting billions of dollars in spending, much of it
on popular programs.</LD>
<TE>   Either candidate is certain to face fierce resistance in the
Legislature, both from Republicans who refuse to raise taxes and
Democrats who oppose program cuts.</TE>
<TE>   But the battle over state money is only the most visible of the
governor's expected difficulties in working with a polarized
Legislature that became even more so in Tuesday's election.</TE>
<TE>   Among the state's biggest problems are substandard public schools,
overcrowded freeways and uncertain water supplies. California also
continues to feel the aftereffects of last year's energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   In his campaign for reelection, Davis offered little in the way of
an agenda he could use to advance in his second term. To win, he
focused mainly on tearing down Simon with television ads depicting
him as an untrustworthy and incompetent businessman.</TE>
<TE>   In spots promoting himself, Davis looked backward, boasting of
higher school test scores, more health coverage for children and
other first-term accomplishments. It was only at the end of the race
that Davis ran an ad promising to pursue more of the same in his
second term.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that we've even had a clear message from him on what
he wants to do for the next four years other than continuing the
things he's done so far," said Larry N. Gerston, a political science
professor at San Jose State.</TE>
<TE>   Simon laid out vague plans for tax cuts, better schools and
improvements in the road, water and power systems. But Simon would
face a Legislature overwhelmingly controlled by Democrats deeply
hostile to a candidate who campaigned as a "conservative Republican."</TE>
<TE>   For any new programs, the governor will be hamstrung by the
state's dismal fiscal outlook. This year, it was only after a
two-month political stalemate that Davis and the Legislature closed a
record budget gap of nearly $24 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Next year could be worse. For now, the state's revenue shortfall
is projected at more than $10 billion, but analysts expect it to
grow. A projected economic turnaround has not occurred. And the
fiscal tricks used last year to balance the books -- spending
postponement, fund transfers and the like -- now are just about
exhausted, making a tax hike or big spending cuts all but inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's results were only likely to further hobble the governor
as he confronts that issue. A ballot initiative to expand before- and
after-school programs -- at a cost of up to $550 million a year --
was leading in early returns and could further constrain the state's
options for balancing the budget.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of the campaign, both candidates refused to say
how they would resolve the crisis. Simon promised to shrink state
government and pledged not to raise taxes. But he was careful not to
rule out any hike in university tuition, park entrance fees or other
charges that Californians pay.</TE>
<TE>   With Davis, Gerston said the outcome was easy to predict: "He's
going to preside over the largest tax increase in recent memory. This
has to be the worst-kept secret in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives in the Legislature, however, have no political
reason to let the governor do that.</TE>
<TE>   In several districts around the state, liberal Democrats and
conservative Republicans defeated moderate opponents in the March
primary, then went on to win the election Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The deepening polarization of the Legislature is the result in
part of a redistricting plan -- approved by representatives of both
parties -- that created more solidly partisan districts, making it
possible for more ideological candidates to prevail.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves liberals prepared to fight to protect programs and
conservatives ready to battle against tax hikes.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats retain a solid majority in both houses of the
Legislature, but the budget requires a two-thirds vote, so a handful
of Republicans must consent to any tax hike.</TE>
<TE>   "Republicans are not going to sit still for a tax increase," said
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political science professor at USC. "They
don't have to."</TE>
<TE>   Pressure for a tax hike will come not just from liberal Democrats
but also from organized labor, a major source of support for
Democratic lawmakers and Davis. Art Pulaski, executive secretary
treasurer of the California Labor Federation, said unions will seek a
tax hike on the rich to avoid cuts elsewhere. "You can't cut any
more," Pulaski said.</TE>
<TE>   For Davis, a staunch centrist already unpopular among state
lawmakers -- even within his own party -- the sharp divide within the
Legislature portends trouble beyond the budget. Even his advisors
acknowledge the coming months will test the governor.</TE>
<TE>   "The minute he's sworn in, he's a lame-duck, term-limited
incumbent, and it's going to be to some degree more difficult to hold
people in line," said Garry South, the governor's top political
strategist.</TE>
<TE>   For Davis, another potential thorn is the cadre of Democrats in
other statewide elected offices, nearly all of whom are potential
candidates for governor in 2006. Among them, according to early
returns Tuesday, could be the newly elected insurance commissioner,
John Garamendi, who ran for governor in 1994; state Atty Gen. Bill
Lockyer, Treasurer Phil Angelides and Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante. Those
officials were locked in tight races in early returns Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   To break apart from the pack, strategists said, any one of them
could try to embarrass the governor the way state Controller Kathleen
Connell did by criticizing him during her 2001 campaign for mayor of
Los Angeles. Already, Bustamante has run television ads portraying
himself as courageous for speaking out against a Davis administration
software procurement scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "They might all start ganging up against Davis, because talk is
cheap," GOP strategist Arnold Steinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Davis would face more than just a changed
political environment. He would enter the new term with an unfamiliar
world view.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, Davis has climbed the state political ladder, running
for higher office time and again. Now, under term limits, Davis could
not run again for governor, so his march through the state political
ranks is complete.</TE>
<TE>   He could run for president or seek to replace Democratic Sen.
Dianne Feinstein if she decides not to seek reelection in 2006. Or he
could govern with an eye toward his legacy rather than toward the
next campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "It does provide him with an opportunity -- if he really wanted to
-- to become an elder statesman," Steinberg said. "The question is
what will be the last thing he wants to be remembered for."</TE>

<HD>Nonvoters Express Disgust at Political System</HD>
<DH>Many say negativity in governor's race and lackluster
candidates turned them off.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lee Romney and Geoffrey Mohan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since 1956, Robert Gamm had made the trek to the voting booth. He
never missed a general election. He never missed a primary. Until
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm really disgusted," said Gamm, 68, a retired public relations
manager and Banana Republic clerk in the Fairfax district of Los
Angeles. "In my lifetime in California, it's the dirtiest campaign
I've seen. I really don't care at this point who is governor."</LD>
<LD>   Gamm joined thousands of other Californians -- old, young,
laborer, professional, Democrat and Republican -- who abstained with
a vengeance.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not apathy," said Ivonne Mendoza, 25, a social worker from
Pasadena who often votes for Green Party candidates. "It's more of a
form of protest.... I think it states that the issues I'm concerned
about are not being spoken about."</TE>
<TE>   Most of those interviewed who withheld their vote Tuesday said
they were repelled by the negative campaigning and lackluster appeal
of Gov. Gray Davis and his Republican counterpart, Bill Simon. Others
faced congressional contests rendered noncompetitive by incumbents
safely ensconced in districts that Republican and Democratic
legislators agreed on to maintain the balance of power.</TE>
<TE>   "I've given up on the system, and I never thought I would say
this," said Gary Hodge, 61, of San Dimas. The salesman and marketing
director said he had voted in every election since 1964, but stopped
two years ago when he decided that the exercise was pointless.</TE>
<TE>   A registered Republican for as long as he can remember, Hodge said
he now believes that "our major party system is tweedledee and
tweedledum.... I don't think there's any choices."</TE>
<TE>   If predictions hold true, the smallest portion of eligible voters
in California history will have cast ballots statewide in this
election -- fewer people by raw number than voted three decades ago,
when the state's population was about 40% smaller, according to some
polls.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Why Go for Either?'</TE>
<TE>   "The one guy, Simon, is a total business failure. So I don't want
to vote for him," said Chris Asquith, 35, a data analyst from
Riverside. "But the other guy, Davis, is just as bad. He blew it on
energy. So why go for either one of them?"</TE>
<TE>   Davis, the incumbent scarred by his handling of the energy crisis
and his incessant campaign fund-raising, spent millions of dollars
attacking Simon. The GOP challenger, meanwhile, committed
embarrassing foibles while on the defensive. In the end, they tarred
each other well enough to chase away Abraham Shamie, an 80-year-old
from Brooklyn.</TE>
<TE>   "They're two thieves," said Shamie, a retired dry-goods store
owner and loyal Democrat who voted in the 2000 presidential election
but stayed away Tuesday. "I see the commercials they put against each
other. One is worse than the other."</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the ballot, Shamie said, was collateral damage in his
war of principle against Davis and Simon -- a sentiment shared by
many other nonvoters.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got the [voter] book in the mail, I didn't even read it,"
Shamie said Tuesday as he munched on a doughnut at Farmers Market. "I
took it and threw it in the garbage -- immediately."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Tommy Swerdlow, a 40-year-old screenwriter who grew up in
a liberal household in New York, lamented his ignorance of ballot
issues -- from billion-dollar school bonds to San Fernando Valley and
Hollywood secession -- but said the governor's race sapped his
inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth of the matter is: I wish I were a little more
informed," he said over lunch with his wife and 3-year-old son. "I
would prefer to be better versed in the side issues and not just let
my [lack of interest] in the governor's race [destroy] my entire
ability to have a voice."</TE>
<TE>   As Swerdlow mused over his shortcomings, Mayor James K. Hahn made
a campaign swing through Farmers Market to push against secession.</TE>
<TE>   Swerdlow didn't recognize him. "I was wondering who that was," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Physician Sonny Lambert considers herself an informed voter. She
was a campaigner for Proposition 187, the 1994 measure to withhold
most public benefits from illegal immigrants. When it was overturned
in the courts, she lost faith in California's ability to decide
public policy issues directly.</TE>
<TE>   "I voted for 187, and the minute 187 was passed someone went to
the judiciary system and had it overturned," she said. "Once the
people have spoken, that's what should be law. This is what the
country is founded on: what people choose, not what special interests
want. Until that is addressed, then professional people like us will
continue to be disgruntled."</TE>
<TE>   Even some who have adopted the United States and its system have
also adopted the custom of not voting.</TE>
<TE>   Argisht Minasyan, 23, a banker and naturalized citizen who gained
the right to vote two years ago, didn't cast his ballot Tuesday. "I
don't like the politics, basically people going at each other," he
said from a cafe table in downtown Los Angeles. "I don't like Davis
or Simon. I think we have two dweebs who don't know what they're
doing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sending a Message</TE>
<TE>   Ody Ketch, a Turkish immigrant from Bellflower, said he has
refused to vote since the late 1980s, when losing a personal lawsuit
convinced him that the legal system was corrupt.</TE>
<TE>   "There are several ways to express dissatisfaction," the
66-year-old engineer said outside a Starbucks in Orange. "I can get a
gun and be a cowboy. I'm taking a peaceful way to express my
dissatisfaction. I won't vote."</TE>
<TE>   This year's contest pushed some habitual abstainers even further
out of the electoral orbit.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Gill, 56, said he expected more from political leaders in the
year after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that our country was finally going to blossom forth and
be an example to the world," he said. "I was so naive. It seems to me
that we've squandered all the goodwill of the world."</TE>
<TE>   He said he felt so voiceless that he couldn't muster the will to
vote.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not even a cog in the wheel," Gill said. "I'm not even a cog.
I'm a nothing. That's the way I feel."</TE>

<HD>Prop. 49 Is Heading to Victory</HD>
<DH>Funding for after-school programs is backed by Arnold
Schwarzenegger. An initiative to allow election-day voter
registration fares poorly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Miguel Bustillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A statewide ballot measure to boost after-school programs at
California's elementary and middle schools was garnering solid
support Tuesday, while a proposal to allow citizens to register and
vote on the same day was foundering.</LD>
<LD>   "The voters of California have spoken loud and clear today," said
Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor who campaigned for the school
program and is considered a potential Republican candidate for
governor in 2006. "As soon as we start implementing this program," he
told supporters, quoting his own famous movie line, "I'll be back."</LD>
<LD>   Even as they elected a governor and other top state officials,
California voters decided the fate of a number of measures that would
take major financial decisions out of the hands of politicians and
automatically fund roads, water projects and housing, in addition to
after-school programs. It was, nonetheless, a relatively small array
of propositions for a state that has had a love affair with the
initiative process.</LD>
<TE>   The same-day voting measure, Proposition 52, was polling poorly,
far short of the majority it needed. It was bankrolled by wealthy San
Francisco philanthropist Rob McKay, an heir to a Taco Bell fortune,
who argued that the best way to improve California's sagging voter
turnout was to allow the state's busy residents to register and cast
a ballot at the polls. But opponents, most notably Secretary of State
Bill Jones, said it could increase voter fraud and lead to
Florida-style election confusion.</TE>
<TE>   "We were outspent about 25 to 1 -- the other side spent about $10
million -- and so we thought the margin might tighten," Dave
Gilliard, political consultant for the campaign against Proposition
52, said, acknowledging that he was surprised at the degree of
opposition. "But the people seemed to see through all the ads. I
think they know there is no roadblock to access to the ballot in
California. The problem is voter apathy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Results of Exit Poll</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles Times exit poll of 60 precincts across the state
found that Proposition 52 fared well among Democrats, especially
those in urban areas, Jews, Latinos and African Americans. However,
it did poorly with Republicans, whites and residents in most parts of
the state outside the Bay Area and Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The after-school programs measure, Proposition 49, was garnering
strong support, , safely above the majority it needed. Schwarzenegger
argued that the proposal to spend up to $550 million a year for
tutoring, homework assistance and recreational programs at elementary
and middle schools filled a vital unmet need.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents, who included the League of Women Voters and an
array of Democratic legislators, argued that it would sidestep the
state budget process and take funding away from other important
needs, possibly even education.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a victory for the kids," said Proposition 49 spokeswoman
Sheri Annis. "If Prop. 49 passes, we believe we will start a trend
throughout the nation toward comprehensive after-school programs."</TE>
<TE>   The Times exit poll showed Proposition 49 polling well among every
demographic group, including men and women, and Republicans as well
as Democrats. The housing measure, Proposition 46, was receiving
solid majority support. i. It was placed on the ballot by Democratic
legislators, led by the liberal leader of the California Senate, John
Burton of San Francisco, who argued that the proposed $2.1-billion
bond issue was desperately needed to fund shelters for battered
women, housing for the homeless and low-income housing for seniors in
a state with sky-high real estate prices.</TE>
<TE>   Republican legislators and taxpayer groups lined up against it,
saying the state was carrying far too much debt and could not afford
to float more bonds given its budget problems.</TE>
<TE>   The transportation measure, Proposition 51, was falling far short
of the majority vote needed.</TE>
<TE>   It was backed by an unlikely coalition, the environmental group
Planning and Conservation League and an array of private developers
and institutions, including cities such as Irvine, which sought to
guarantee funding for certain projects by siphoning off 30% of the
car sales tax money that now goes to the state budget.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Strong Opposition</TE>
<TE>   It was lambasted by a wide range of government watchdog groups and
state lawmakers, who called it one of the more brazen attempts to
bypass the Legislature and secure funding for projects that probably
would not make the cut in the competitive budget process.</TE>
<TE>   The water measure, Proposition 50, was heading toward the majority
vote it needed. It was backed by water officials and
environmentalists, who argued that the $3.4-billion bond was needed
to buy wetlands, help preserve water from the Colorado River and
improve the safety of tap water.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents, primarily taxpayer groups, argued that the state
could ill afford to float more bonds. They also questioned whether
the state should pay landowners so much for their wetland properties.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, voters also considered Proposition 48, a measure to clear
up language in the state Constitution after the merger of the
Municipal and Superior Court systems, which was previously approved
by voters. It was receiving backing from nearly three out of four
voters.</TE>

<HD>State, L.A. School Bonds Head for Passage</HD>
<DH>Both measures enjoy healthy margins. In Los Angeles, Supt.
Romer celebrates the victory.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In an endorsement of greater spending to relieve overcrowding of
schools, voters across California and in the Los Angeles Unified
School District were giving healthy margins of approval Tuesday to
massive education bond issues that will fuel years of campus
construction projects.</LD>
<LD>   The statewide measure, Proposition 47, will provide $13.5 billion
for construction and renovation of K-12 and university campuses
around California.</LD>
<LD>   In the Los Angeles school district, an overwhelming percentage of
voters were favoring Measure K, a $3.3-billion construction bond
issue. Combined with its share of the state bond funds, L.A. Unified
hopes to finish 80 new schools and 79 renovation projects, and to
begin work on 40 new campuses.</LD>
<TE>   State Supt. of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin was pleased that
Proposition 47 was headed toward passage. "I think this shows a good
trend," she said. "It looks like the voters are going to give
California's children and students what they need: clean, safe,
well-lighted schools."</TE>
<TE>   Roy Romer, superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School
District, was jubilant. "This is a tremendous statement from L.A. for
educating children," Romer said. "You know that there have been a lot
of problems in the district in the past, but this says we want these
schools built and we trust you to do it.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll begin tomorrow with very thorough plans for implementation,
and we're going to really consult closely with the community on the
siting of each of these schools," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Measure K needed 55% of the votes to pass, while Proposition 47
needed a simple majority.</TE>
<TE>   The bonds are critical to school districts and universities
because other funding options are so limited. Proposition 13 sharply
curtailed school districts' tax base, and developers have curtailed
efforts to make them pay fees to fund school construction. State law
requires school districts to attempt to pass local propositions and
use their own funds before they can levy fees on developers.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters viewed Measure K as a way to redeem L.A. Unified's
reputation. The district faced harsh criticism over its handling of
Proposition BB, a $2.4-billion bond measure passed in 1997, and
eventually acknowledged that poor management had caused the district
to miscalculate by $600 million the amount of school repair work it
could perform.</TE>
<TE>   Backers of Measure K hoped that voters were getting past such
district missteps as the Belmont Learning Complex, a $175-million
downtown high school that was left unfinished after toxic fumes were
discovered beneath the property. That campus is now being studied for
ways to safely complete it.</TE>
<TE>   Backers of the two bond issues had raised $11 million from unions,
developers, university foundations and others.</TE>
<TE>   Organized opposition to the measures was scarce. A few legislators
and members of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. said the state bond
was too skewed toward urban districts and both measures were too
expensive. Interest payments for both measures over 30 years will
cost as much as the bonds themselves. The Los Angeles measure will
raise annual property taxes by $60 per $100,000 of assessed value.</TE>
<TE>   Even with such staggering amounts of money from the bonds, it is
unlikely that the measures will completely remedy California's and
L.A.'s overcrowded schools, educators say.</TE>
<TE>   School districts throughout the state report they will need $20
billion to build enough facilities to house 1.2 million K-12 students
now in overcrowded schools, according to the legislative analyst's
office. The bond issues will set the stage for similar measures two
years from now. Backers of Measure K say they are planning to place a
measure on the spring 2004 ballot to create seats for an additional
200,000 students by 2017.</TE>
<TE>   State legislators have already arranged to put a $12-billion
school construction bond on the 2004 ballot.</TE>

<LD>Whatever astronomical political effects that Tuesday's vote on San
Fernando Valley secession may have on Los Angeles and the Valley, it
officially marked the realignment of Tanny Wiggins' personal cosmos.</LD>
<LD>   Wiggins spent election day as she has spent much of the past two
years: talking herself hoarse on the phone in the cause of Valley
cityhood, chatting up passersby on the sidewalk, distributing
literature, treating anyone with the thirst for it to a great draught
of her passionate conviction.</LD>
<LD>   In the course of the long campaign for secession, the 64-year-old
retiree was the exemplar of the citizen-volunteer who answers phones,
runs errands, enters data into computers and stands for hours at card
tables set up in shopping malls.</LD>
<TE>   While higher-profile secessionists spoke before television cameras
and mass meetings, Wiggins embraced the stoop labor of the movement.</TE>
<TE>   During a noontime hiatus Tuesday, Wiggins sipped an iced coffee
outside the Valley Independence Committee's second-story office and
looked down on the Ventura Boulevard traffic in Van Nuys. The good
sense of a Valley breakaway from Los Angeles, she said, struck her
like a meteor in 2000 when she went with a friend to hear Valley VOTE
leader Jeff Brain address a senior citizens meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really sort of ho-hum about it, but my friend was
interested. I don't think I've ever had anything hit me like that. I
think it took two seconds, and I knew it was a match," Wiggins said.
"All of a sudden I could see government coming home where I could
touch it. Government being my government, not just a lot of distant
statistics. Government that would be accountable to me. I thought,
'Boy, would that be wonderful!' "</TE>
<TE>   Many preelection polls forecast secession's defeat, but over the
long campaign Wiggins won many personal victories in the form of
newfound understanding.</TE>
<TE>   Wiggins worked for more than three decades in the business
operations of KNBC-TV Channel 4 in Los Angeles. Part of that time was
spent in the department that handles broadcast practices and
standards, including political campaign ads. Despite that experience,
Wiggins said she was taken aback by the tactics of anti-secession
leaders, such as Mayor James K. Hahn, who predicted dire results if
voters approved Valley secession.</TE>
<TE>   "It breaks my heart that the other side has put fear into the
hearts of vulnerable people, like old people," she said. "I just want
to take them in my arms and say, 'No, no. It's going to be all
right.' "</TE>
<TE>   Wiggins, who owns a home in Sherman Oaks, has lived in the Valley
since moving from New York City 31 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Crisscrossing the landscape in the cause of secession brought her
into contact with people from different parts of the Valley and
different income and ethnic backgrounds. That experience, she said,
has meant "I've gotten to know the Valley more and I've grown to love
it more.... I feel a camaraderie and a cohesiveness I didn't feel
before."</TE>
<TE>   Wiggins finished her iced coffee and returned to work. With the
polls not closing until 8 p.m., there were still a good 7 1/2 hours
to win an election. She gathered a clutch of brochures, tucked a
large red, white and blue Valley independence sign under one arm,
reframed her arguments in her head, and set out for the Valley
cityhood phone bank at the Remax Realty office four blocks east on
Ventura Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way she encountered Maria Sauno, 28, of Pacoima. In
response to Wiggins' inquiry, Sauno, resting on a bus bench in front
of a clothing store, said, "I want to vote but I don't know what to
vote for."</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing to me," Wiggins replied, "is local
control. We pay taxes to the city of Los Angeles, property taxes,
business taxes, sales taxes.... "</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, Wiggins, with a voice that was becoming more hoarse by
the moment, had engaged a young couple a few paces from the bus bench
and reiterating the secessionist conviction that cityhood would allow
the Valley eventually to part company with the Los Angeles Unified
School District.</TE>
<TE>   Wiggins then ambushed a young man putting coins into a parking
meter near his chrome-trimmed pickup truck. The man listened to her
presentation, then announced, "I'm for it."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone, however, was buying. A young man flying past on a
bicycle pointed to Wiggins' sign. "You know what that's gonna cost
us?" he demanded.</TE>
<TE>   "No more than it is already," she called after him.</TE>
<TE>   Wiggins approached a woman on a pay phone. "Would you ... ?" she
began.</TE>
<TE>   The woman cut her off with a firm shake of the head, "No."</TE>
<TE>   After reaching the phone bank, Wiggins sat with three fellow
secession backers, ringing up likely voters whom a previous phone
survey had indicated favored secession. As cheerily as she could, she
reiterated on each call a standard message: "Hello, this is a
friendly call from Valley cityhood, reminding you to vote yes on
Measure F today. Remember, the polls close at 8 p.m."</TE>
<TE>   Despite her enthusiasm, Wiggins confided, she was aware of the
difficulty she and her colleagues faced as the final hours of
election day wore away. But Tuesday was not the end of things, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have laid the groundwork," she said. "I'm already
thinking about how I'd do things differently the next time.... I
think we've all learned from our mistakes and seen what we could do
better. I think I'd like to be involved in the initiating stages next
time -- help plan. I'm even making ideas in my head as I go along
today."</TE>

<HD>Medical Marijuana Measure Leads; 'Fair Trade' Coffee Lags</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John M. Glionna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Voters here were approving a measure Tuesday that would direct
officials to study whether to establish this liberal city as among
the first nationwide to grow and distribute its own medical
marijuana.</LD>
<LD>   In a first-step gesture of defiance against the federal
government's zero-tolerance marijuana policy, returns showed San
Franciscans approving Proposition S by nearly a 2-to-1margin.</LD>
<LD>   The measure calls for officials to investigate issues ranging from
where medical pot could be grown to what liability and legal
consequences the city might face.</LD>
<TE>   "We consider this vote a mandate" for the city to start growing
and selling its own medical marijuana, said Supervisor Mark Leno, a
sponsor of Proposition S. "But there are still many questions we need
answered."</TE>
<TE>   Across the state, Californians confronted a host of issues from
the substantive to the quirky. Rallying behind Mayor Jerry Brown,
Oakland residents were headed toward approving a measure to hire 100
new police officers in a city troubled by a rising homicide rate.</TE>
<TE>   In adjacent Berkeley, meanwhile, residents were soundly rejecting
a ballot initiative requiring that all coffee sold in city cafes be
"fair trade" as a way to help struggling Third-World growers.</TE>
<TE>   The measure also called for all Berkeley coffee to be
environmentally sensitive organic or shade-grown.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal, Measure O, was inspired by a Bay Area attorney who
wants growers of coffee sold by the cup in local cafes to be paid a
fair-trade price of $1.26 per pound of coffee. That would be three
times the 43-cent worldwide average.</TE>
<TE>   The measure was opposed by Starbucks and other major coffee
sellers. One glossy mailer sent to Berkeley households the week
before the election showed a man being led away in handcuffs by
police. "The crime: serving the wrong kind of coffee," the ad read.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, a city overwhelmed with a growing homeless
population, voters were handily passing a measure to change the way
the city assists indigent residents.</TE>
<TE>   Sponsored by Supervisor Gavin Newsom, a mayoral hopeful,
Proposition N slashes city welfare payments made to about 3,000
homeless people from $395 to just $59 a month.</TE>
<TE>   The savings would create more affordable housing and add services.</TE>
<TE>   Voters in other California cities continued a long-running
ballot-box war over urban sprawl, weighing in on more than two dozen
local measures that pit development interests against citizen
activists from coastal communities to one-stoplight farm towns.</TE>
<TE>   In early returns, anti-sprawl activists appeared to be winning
many of those battles, from a hillside housing proposal in Ventura to
a fight over a 22-acre rail yard in Alameda. And in rural Nevada
County, a controversial pro-property rights measure was narrowly
losing. The initiative was proposed to create a streamlined process
for compensating property owners when county regulations block full
development of their land.</TE>
<TE>   California voters also tackled a variety of water issues Tuesday.
With 94% of the votes counted, San Francisco residents were passing
Proposition A, a $1.6-billion bond measure to help finance the
revamping of the region's Hetch-Hetchy water system, which serves 2.4
million customers in the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   The 13-year, $3.6-billion project involves the repair, expansion
and earthquake retrofit of the nearly century-old city-owned system.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining $2 billion will come from the system's suburban
users.</TE>
<TE>   The measure, however, does not direct any funds to study whether
to tear down the O'Shaugnessy Dam and reservoir -- the source of the
city water along the Tuolumne River in Yosemite National Park -- and
return the once-pristine valley to its natural state.</TE>
<TE>   Reprising the environmental battle started by pioneering
naturalist John Muir a century ago, advocates failed to attach a
provision to Proposition S that would have paid for the feasibility
study.</TE>
<TE>   In Folsom, early returns showed voters supporting a charter
amendment prohibiting citizens from paying for a water line retrofit
that would require many to meter their water use for the first time.
If voters pass Measure P and reject water meters, federal officials
say, they will cut off about a fourth of Folsom's nonessential water
supply.</TE>
<TE>   The city of about 50,000 near Sacramento is one of a shrinking
number of holdouts in California that don't bill customers according
to use. That puts it out of step with prevailing conservation
practices and -- U.S. Bureau of Reclamation officials say -- with
federal policy. Elsewhere, measures to prohibit the addition of
fluoride to city water systems were winning in Redding and
Watsonville. State officials kept a close eye on San Francisco
returns, because previous elections have been marked by allegations
of voter fraud and the city has seen a revolving door of election
chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   In one election, ballot box lids were found mysteriously floating
in San Francisco Bay.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Secretary of State Bill Jones hired a special
consultant to watch over and advise city election officials.</TE>

<HD>Republicans Take Lead in Top Texas Contests</HD>

<LD>Republicans appeared to have kept their grip on both the governor's
mansion and a key Senate seat Tuesday as the party fought to maintain
its hold on Texas government -- and keep the president's home
hospitable.</LD>
<LD>   Incumbent Republican Rick Perry, a plain-spoken cotton farmer from
the Panhandle, was leading in his bid to stay in the governor's
mansion.</LD>
<LD>   Fellow Republican John Cornyn was headed to Washington after
beating out Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk for a Senate seat.</LD>
<TE>   Just three hours after the polling stations closed, an exuberant
Perry appeared before supporters in Austin and gave a victory speech.</TE>
<TE>   But his opponent, borderland oil baron Tony Sanchez, wasn't about
to go down quietly. After spending nearly $70 million of his fortune
on the campaign, Sanchez wasn't ready to concede.</TE>
<TE>   "I am still going to give him hell until the last vote is
counted," said Sanchez, who Democrats hoped would become the state's
first Latino governor. "This race is a long, long, long way from
being over."</TE>
<TE>   With less than half the vote counted, Atty. Gen. Cornyn went ahead
with a victory speech. "I want to be a senator for all Texans," said
Cornyn, whose party has accused Democrats of exploiting racial and
ethnic splits.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk stood before weeping supporters before midnight, accompanied
by his wife and mother, to acknowledge his loss.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't get into this race just to make history, but we did,"
said Kirk, who had hoped to become the first black senator since
Reconstruction. "The state of Texas has never seen a Democratic
ticket like this."</TE>
<TE>   A tumultuous election day in President Bush's home state stretched
into a long night of vote counting and mechanical snags. Electronic
glitches left hundreds of thousands of votes in limbo in Fort Worth
and surrounding Tarrant County, the state's fourth-largest county.</TE>
<TE>   In Bexar County, a traditionally Democratic region anchored by San
Antonio, problems with counting early votes could delay the tally
until early today.</TE>
<TE>   The closest of the major statewide contests was the race for
lieutenant governor between Republican David Dewhurst and Democrat
John Sharp. The vote was roughly split, but Dewhurst appeared to be
pulling ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes have been high all season. Republicans held a profound
advantage -- from agriculture commissioner to governor, the party
held every single statewide position. Inertia was on their side, and
so was the White House. Under pressure to save face by maintaining
his party's clout at home, Bush had returned repeatedly to Texas for
fund-raisers for his former Republican colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   But the Democrats came after them hard. The party assembled the
so-called Dream Team -- the black Kirk, the Latino Sanchez and the
white Sharp were touted as the party's ticket back to its lost power.
For years, demographers and political scientists have predicted that
Texas would swing back to Democratic control thanks to a growing
Latino population.</TE>
<TE>   "We're definitely a comeback party," said Democratic consultant
Marc Campos. "Even the fact that it'll be so close -- if that ain't a
comeback, I don't know what is."</TE>
