<HD>Debunking the Big-Spender Myth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Balzar</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let's look back a quarter-century at the prevailing cliche of
domestic politics: Democrats are the irresponsible spenders in
Washington; Republicans are the conscientious spenders.</LD>
<LD>   Leading up to the inauguration of George W. Bush a year ago, we
lived through the tenure of two Democratic presidents and two
Republican presidents. Of the Democrats, Jimmy Carter served one term
and Bill Clinton two. Of the Republicans, Ronald Reagan served two
terms, the senior George Bush one.</LD>
<LD>   So, Republicans held office 12 years and Democrats 12.</LD>
<TE>   What does history tell us? This: Year by year, Republican
presidents on the average spent almost 22% more than the government
brought in. Democratic presidents averaged annual deficits of 7%.</TE>
<TE>   Said differently, Republican presidents swam in red ink three
times as deep as Democratic presidents for most of a generation.</TE>
<TE>   Or, we can look at the numbers president by president: Clinton's
spending averaged a deficit of 4.4%. Carter, 13.23%. Bush the senior,
21.75%. Reagan, 21.87%.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, yes, Congress passes the appropriations bills, and the
Democrats have dominated Congress until recently. But the president
drafts the budget, sets the agenda, chooses where to fight and where
to compromise, wields the veto, commands the bully pulpit and spends
the money. The trend line is too long, the numbers too decisive to be
disregarded.</TE>
<TE>   Recent history is even more instructive. Clinton, who managed to
be at once polarizing and bipartisan, began with a GOP-level 22%
deficit. That went down every year of his presidency. After five
years, the budget went into surplus for the first time since 1969,
and stayed in the black. His final budget carried a 12% surplus.</TE>
<TE>   His successor, in office only a year and a strong ideological
champion of limited government, now acknowledges he will return
America to deficit, the result of tax cuts, recession, general
spending and Sept. 11 costs.</TE>
<TE>   I say we retire the cliche and find a new one. A quarter-century
is long enough to be fooling ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   As we begin this election year, there are other commonplace
cliches that no longer guide us wisely in our political debate. Such
as, Democrats give us big government and Republicans rein it in.</TE>
<TE>   Under Carter, federal spending amounted to about 21% of the
country's gross domestic product. That number inched up under Reagan
and the elder Bush to 22%. It declined under Clinton to 20%. When
Clinton left office, the federal government accounted for a smaller
part of the domestic economy than at any time since the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1990, during the first Bush presidency, and 1999, the end
of Clinton's, the number of civilians employed by the federal
government fell almost 8%. If you exclude growth in the number of
postal workers during that period, the decrease in federal civilian
employment was an even more dramatic 18%.</TE>
<TE>   I thank the Census Bureau's Statistical Abstract, Chapter 10, and
the U.S. Treasury Department for these numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Some might say that Reagan actually started the decline in the
size and scope of government by popularizing the idea. There's much
truth here. It's also true that a Democratic president brought it to
realization, and not reluctantly either.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, Reagan denounced the welfare system. Clinton signed the bill
that fundamentally altered it. Reagan called for smaller government,
Clinton delivered.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, sharp differences exist today between the two parties on
government and spending. But the differences, it must be noted, are
not so much about dollar totals. A divided Congress has not bucked
the president very hard on the overall amount of spending, at least
not yet.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the battle lines have formed: Who should receive what in
the name of economic stimulus? How much of this spending should we
pay for now with taxes and how much should we defer in the form of
debt? It is a worthwhile debate, an important one. Its implications
affect millions of Americans in the short run, and no doubt all of us
over time. This fight goes directly to the philosophy of fairness and
the extent to which government should be an arbiter of fairness. It
raises the question of today versus tomorrow in terms of governance.
It also is a fight over business and consumer psychology: how
government can best encourage an economy that will provide for its
citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Almost none of this debate has do with worn-out campaign
cliches--remnants of the past--no matter how glibly they roll off the
tongue.</TE>

<AU>STEPHEN PHILIP COHEN</AU>
<BD>Stephen Philip Cohen is a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin Powell will be visiting India and Pakistan
next week in the hope, first, of forestalling a potentially serious
war between these two states over Kashmir and also of ensuring their
continued assistance in the U.S. war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   For the past three months, India and Pakistan have exploited
American concerns over terrorism to the point where Washington has
become a pawn in their rivalry. The U.S. has to make it clear to both
countries that this must stop.</LD>
<LD>   If India continues its unprecedented military buildup against
Pakistan--risking an accident or miscalculation that could quickly
escalate to a nuclear war--and if Pakistan does not act decisively to
round up groups that have committed terrible atrocities in India,
then Washington should walk away, leaving them to another 50 years of
ruinous rivalry.</LD>
<TE>   This is not the message that either India or Pakistan wants to
hear. They are obsessed with a regional blame game, each holding the
other accountable for past, present and future bad deeds and each
refusing to accept responsibility for its own misguided policies.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan remains obsessed with Kashmir. It was relatively easy for
Pakistan to drop its support for the Taliban in Afghanistan, but if
President Pervez Musharraf were to abandon Pakistan's claim on
Kashmir, he quickly would be overthrown.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistanis also fear that any compromise on Kashmir, without
reciprocal Indian actions, will simply lead to more and more Indian
demands. Pakistanis do not want to become "West Bangladesh," a
militarily weak state subordinate to a hegemonic India.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Indians, they are quite rightly infuriated with
Pakistan over its support for separatist groups and terrorist squads
operating in Kashmir and in India proper.</TE>
<TE>   However, New Delhi has misgoverned Kashmir for more than 40 years,
which led to a massive popular uprising in the 1980s. Further, some
Indian politicians now talk of finishing Pakistan off once and for
all--despite the risk of nuclear war--on the grounds that Pakistan is
a "theocracy" and that Islamic Pakistan is bent on undercutting
secular India.</TE>
<TE>   Indian opinion seems to be deeply divided as to whether New Delhi
can live with Pakistan or whether it should isolate, or even destroy,
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, Secretary Powell's foreign policy team rejected
involvement in the India-Pakistan rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   One mid-level official told me that Washington "had no dog in this
fight."</TE>
<TE>   He and others valued India for its economic potential and as a
possible ally in the strategic competition with a rising China.
Pakistan was an afterthought, a problem country of little strategic
importance.</TE>
<TE>   The World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks changed that,
propelling Islamabad into the front line in the U.S. war against
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   What should Powell do now?</TE>
<TE>   First, Powell must put on his general's cap and point out the
folly of either side pressing the current confrontation to the point
of war. He has the credentials to warn them that previous
India-Pakistan wars have been the result of gross miscalculation of
political and military balances and that such a miscalculation this
time could lead to a nuclear exchange.</TE>
<TE>   In such an exchange, India would come off badly. While India is
superior in terms of conventional arms, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is
not trivial, and prevailing wind patterns would dust India with
deadly nuclear fallout.</TE>
<TE>   Second, Powell should commit the United States to a long-term
diplomatic engagement in the region. No U.S. administration has
addressed the broader India-Pakistan problem, including Kashmir,
since John F. Kennedy tried to broker a dialogue in 1962-63.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of American engagement now should be the establishment of
a South Asia peace process.</TE>
<TE>   This need not mean U.S. mediation, which is opposed by New Delhi,
but Washington could play a facilitating role in negotiations that
are likely to last for years.</TE>
<TE>   This engagement should feature a special emissary with
presidential authority. Future strategic collaboration with India and
Pakistan should be based on their willingness to participate in this
process.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Powell should offer specific short-term proposals. One
should be to Pakistan: Immediately cease support for all terrorist
groups and for Kashmiri separatists.</TE>
<TE>   And India should be asked to renew its cease-fire in Kashmir and
to move toward free elections there later this year; Pakistan already
has agreed to hold elections in its part of Kashmir in October.</TE>
<TE>   These actions are feasible and timely and could be the initial
steps in a peace process.</TE>
<TE>   If India and Pakistan are not prepared to undertake them, then
Washington must reconsider its relationship with both.</TE>

<HD>The Summers of Harvard U.'s Black Discontent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York. E-mail: pinkerto@ix.netcom.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of course Lawrence Summers, the rookie president of Harvard, was
going to get in trouble. As a New Democrat-ish alumnus of the Clinton
administration, he was well to the right of the Harvard campus, where
the ideological spectrum runs mostly from New Left to Old Left.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, Summers was already under suspicion when he
trespassed into further political incorrectness. First, he criticized
grade inflation and then he took on black studies. The storm that
followed revealed much not only about the state of the academy but
also the fate of "diversity."</LD>
<LD>   Last fall, as part of an overall agenda for upgrading scholarship
on campus, Summers invited Cornel West, a professor of Afro-American
studies, in for a chat about grade inflation (these days, half of all
Harvard grades are A's, and West's grades are notoriously lenient)
and work product (West is best known of late for his role as
political advisor to liberal-left Democrats Bill Bradley and Al
Sharpton and for his rap CD).</LD>
<TE>   Summers probably thought he was offering friendly advice. Having
taught at Harvard earlier in his career, he knew that college
executives have little leverage over tenured faculty. But West wasn't
friendly back. He told National Public Radio that it was
"unprecedented" for him to be "attacked and insulted in that
particular way." Soon, the rest of the Afro-American department and
West's friend, Sharpton, were blasting away at Summers. Jesse Jackson
even flew in for a guest-scold.</TE>
<TE>   Summers quickly apologized. From the point of view of keeping his
job, he did the right thing. But to the extent that Harvard has a
mission of doing the right thing by the country as a whole, Summers
was wrong. Why? Because, as an academic, West is something of a
lightweight. And the orthodoxy that West &amp; Co. have imposed is the
enemy of the diversity that Harvard supposedly celebrates.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, despite West's saying it was unprecedented for him to be
attacked, there's plenty of precedent, for good reason. In 1995, Leon
Wieseltier wrote a 5,500-word piece in the liberal-leaning New
Republic titled "The Unreal World of Cornel West." Wieseltier
criticized West for his prose, which he deemed "noisy, tedious,
slippery," as well as for his ideas, which speak for themselves, as
in this Westianism: "Marxist thought becomes even more relevant after
the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe than
it was before."</TE>
<TE>   As the New Republic says, West lives in an unreal world. Lingering
Marxism is a part of this unreality, and so is grade inflation; if
nobody gets a bad mark, then nobody is disrespected--right? West
wants the upside of "diversity," which seems to mean his voice being
heard, without the downside of true diversity, which is the freedom
of others, including his employers, to evaluate that voice.</TE>
<TE>   At its etymological essence, diversity--the condition of being
different--implies debate, disagreement, even conflict. Diversity
without difference is inherently artificial, a precious orchid-like
confection that can exist only in a hothouse such as Harvard. And so
Summers, fresh wind that he was, had to be shut down.</TE>
<TE>   This is a point made by Peter Skerry, professor of government at
Claremont McKenna College, in the winter 2002 issue of the Brookings
Review titled "Beyond Sushiology: Does Diversity Work?" Skerry
defines sushiology as the presumption that diversity programs can be
like choosing from different varieties of the same fish-food. Sushi,
after all, is still sushi.</TE>
<TE>   Genuine diversity, Skerry writes, brings genuine contention, as
seen in recent struggles over immigration. And yet it's simpler, he
says, to label whites who resist foreign influxes as "racist,"
ignoring similar immigration-related feuds among nonwhite
populations.</TE>
<TE>   But don't count on much honest talk on these topics from Summers.
No doubt he has learned his lesson. Honesty as the best policy may be
good theory, but "diversity," no matter how much dishonesty it
requires, is the best career strategy.</TE>

<LD>Where is Osama bin Laden? Where is Mullah Mohammed Omar? And now
where are the justice minister and half a dozen other leading
officials of the toppled Taliban government? This last group actually
surrendered to a newly installed governor of Afghanistan's Kandahar
province, but despite U.S. demands to interview them the officials
were allowed to walk away. Enough is enough. The United States needs
to lean on the central and provincial governments--lean hard--and get
the justice minister and his colleagues back for questioning and
perhaps for arrest.</LD>
<LD>   Afghanistan remains chaotic, with warlords controlling some areas,
international peacekeepers only in the capital, U.S. and other troops
scattered around the country. It is not surprising that the interim
government of Prime Minister Hamid Karzai in Kabul is unable to have
all its orders carried out. But it must not be lax in dealing with
the issue of the missing officials.</LD>
<LD>   The United States already has custody of nearly 400 pro-Taliban
soldiers, who apparently are providing information that, along with
recovered computer disks and printed materials, has helped prevent
planned terrorist attacks on Americans. The intelligence "take" from
someone as high-ranking as the justice minister could be
considerable.</LD>
<TE>   Some Afghan officials have said they will not arrest every Taliban
member. Fine. There's no need for FBI interrogators in Afghanistan to
talk to the janitor in the Taliban Foreign Ministry building. But
Taliban Cabinet ministers ran a government that was entwined with Bin
Laden's Al Qaeda like ivy on an oak. The regime made Bin Laden's
terror possible, including the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Letting high-ranking Taliban members escape would make it possible
for the extremist regime that oppressed the nation for five years to
regroup. By some accounts, the Taliban defense minister and another
Cabinet minister were among the seven turned loose after they
surrendered.</TE>
<TE>   The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Richard B.
Myers, said this week that top Taliban leaders were of "great
interest" to the United States, which expected to be able to question
them. That's a point that needs to be made again to Kandahar Gov. Gul
Agha Shirzai, Karzai and their underlings.</TE>
<TE>   It is true that Afghan fighters have for centuries "turned their
hats," adopting headgear the color or shape of their enemy's when
they surrendered. With a new hat, the right ethnic ties and perhaps a
bribe, they could return to their homes. This time around, however,
the stakes are too high to let the top rank of the vanquished foe go
free.</TE>
<TE>   Also of great concern is the possibility that Iran is giving
refuge to some Al Qaeda members from neighboring Afghanistan. Iran is
largely still controlled by Islamic extremists, though of the Shiite
rather than Sunni branch of Islam. Tehran bitterly opposed the
Taliban regime, and a Foreign Ministry spokesman denied that Iran is
providing refuge to Al Qaeda fighters. President Bush said Thursday
Iran must bar "Al Qaeda murderers" and must surrender any who have
crossed the border.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan soldiers and U.S. forces need to keep searching for Bin
Laden and Omar, the Taliban head. The hunt for top lieutenants of
Omar also needs to be vigorously pursued. Interrogating prisoners is
a first step to bringing war criminals to justice and gaining
information that can help disrupt terrorist attacks. Afghans, after
enduring decades of war, should recognize that as much as Americans.</TE>

<LD>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority Board of Directors voted
Wednesday to implement a long-contested federal consent decree while
simultaneously continuing to fight it all the way to the U.S. Supreme
Court. This surely sounds like doublespeak, but MTA officials insist
there's no contradiction. At issue, they say, is not the decree's
goal--improving bus service--but technical issues about how
compliance with the decree should be measured and who can order
remedies. Never mind that a U.S. district judge, a court-appointed
special master, a three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals and, most recently, a broader 9th Circuit panel have disposed
of these questions; the MTA decided to try for an answer it likes
better.</LD>
<LD>   It would be more honest for the MTA just to come out and say it
hates the consent decree. Transit officials note pointedly that the
decree's restriction on how many passengers are forced to stand over
a given period is among the most stringent in the nation. They chafe
at following orders from judges and arbitrators who aren't
transportation experts. But the MTA wouldn't be held to a consent
decree had it been doing a good job in the first place.</LD>
<TE>   The Bus Riders Union and the NAACP Legal and Educational Defense
Fund filed a civil rights suit in 1994 alleging that the transit
agency discriminated against poor and minority riders by neglecting
the bus system and pouring money into costly rail projects. Rather
than going to court, the MTA in 1996 voluntarily signed the consent
decree. The deal didn't stay out of court for long.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA argues that it has the right to appeal and that its
appeals have won a money-saving reduction in the number of new buses
it had to buy. But that only proves that the process allows for
disagreements. Where the courts have not disagreed is on the
measurement terms set out by the consent decree and on the court's
role in solving them, the two points the MTA continues to fight.</TE>
<TE>   Some legal experts doubt that the Supreme Court will hear the
case. Still, the Bus Riders Union worries that the court will attempt
to undo not just this but other civil rights consent decrees. The MTA
says its appeal is simply about how to interpret a contract, but it
is not above using the bus rider group's fears to press it to
negotiate on easing the decree.</TE>
<TE>   That new MTA Chief Executive Roger Snoble was unable or unwilling
to convince the board to drop its stubborn battle is disappointing,
given his promising start in meeting with the bus riders group. He
and the board should think of the flip side of the bus riders' fears:
If the court declines the case, his arguments are toast and the bus
riders won't be cutting  the MTA an inch of slack. Not a great way to
start.</TE>

<LD>Yes, his hamburgers are fresh and square like his public persona.
Yes, the orphaned onetime busboy was a modern Horatio Alger who
turned a likable personality and down-home Ohio burger place into the
third-ranking international chain. Yes, he was the cheery, chubby,
ubiquitous uncle in short sleeves who starred in his own long-running
ads. But, no, he won't be back. Dave Thomas, who founded Wendy's
Old-Fashioned Hamburgers and gave it his daughter's nickname, died of
liver cancer the other day at 69.</LD>
<LD>   Some surveys showed that 90% of Americans recognized Thomas'
plain, slightly tilted, bespectacled, bemused visage. Less recognized
is that he spent millions of dollars and the last years of his life
quietly facilitating the adoptions of countless American orphans into
the kind of loving, stable home that he never knew as a child.</LD>
<LD>   Born to unwed parents, Thomas was adopted at six weeks. At 5, his
mother died and he traipsed after an itinerant father who married
many times. Thomas' security came from summertimes with a
grandmother, who taught him hard work and never to cut corners
(hence, the square burgers).</LD>
<TE>   In 1992, he founded the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption. He
financed it with book and speech earnings and again traipsed all over
the country, this time tirelessly testifying before legislatures,
governors, luncheons and even lone television cameras to raise
adoption awareness, to support legal reforms and boost private
incentives to encourage adoptions.</TE>
<TE>   In Montana, for instance, he underwrote the compilation of a state
government book containing stories and photographs of scores of
developmentally disabled orphans. Then he ordered copies of the
"Treasure Book" installed at the front counter of every Wendy's in
the state. "Adopt a special child," he said. "They grow up to be
special people." Within months, dozens of youngsters had found new
families.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, arriving at an ad shoot soon after quadruple
bypass surgery, Thomas handed out T-shirts that said, "Dave's Back"
on the back and "Dave's Front" on the front. Today, alas, Dave's
Gone. But not the thousands of loving family homes he helped create
across this country for orphaned children. Now, that was a Biggie.</TE>

<LD>Re "L.A. Zoo Anticipates Swift Renewal of Accreditation," Jan. 4:
Growing up in Los Angeles, I fondly remember my visits to the
glorious L.A. Zoo as a young child when it opened in 1966. Imagine my
shock when I returned to the zoo 22 years later with my nephews, only
to find that it had decayed into a sad remnant of its former beauty.
The exhibits looked rundown, the landscaping needed work and the
entire place had a sad atmosphere. No wonder the zoo had trouble
getting its accreditation in 1995.</LD>
<LD>   Since then the situation has really turned around, and the L.A.
Zoo has regained its former glory and beauty. Thanks to new
leadership and support from the voters who approved needed bond
construction funds, new exhibits have been built, the animals appear
healthier and happier and the whole atmosphere is much more vibrant
and festive.</LD>
<LD>   On behalf of my children and all those who love visits to our
revitalized zoo, I want to thank zoo director Manuel A. Mollinedo and
his staff for all their hard work and wish them good luck in the
accreditation process.</LD>

<LD>I agree with "Our Gangs, Our Terrorists" (editorial, Jan. 5), which
states that many Americans do not stand firmly behind the war against
gang violence because they do not feel as vulnerable to this threat
as they do to international terrorism. For this reason, I believe
that the Latino political and community leadership should take a more
active role in considering new methods to end the senseless killing
of our innocent children.</LD>
<LD>   This is our new struggle. Families and children are being
terrorized and kept hostage in their neighborhoods, even shot in
their front yards by our own people. The silence of Latino leadership
on this issue has made it difficult for social services and law
enforcement agencies, as well as our judicial system and local
governments, to act decisively against street terrorists. For
community empowerment to have real meaning we must act to resolve the
incessant problem of gang violence in our poorer neighborhoods.</LD>

<LD>Judging by "Crash Reveals Small Planes as Giant Security Headache"
(Jan. 8), the pundits and know-nothings are in full cry over reining
in private aviation. May I, an inactive private and commercial pilot
and certified flight instructor, offer some comments?</LD>
<LD>   Charles Bishop, 15, if he had a student license, could rent an
airplane for an hour of practice for his licensing exam, be handed
the keys and be on his own. He should have been stopped by his
parents, friends, et al., some of whom are coming forward belatedly
to tell us they knew he was troubled.</LD>
<LD>   You can tighten up access to airports, and this has been done
since my teenage flying days, but people with proper access can still
take an airplane and use it as a suicide weapon.</LD>
<TE>   If the FAA tries to apply all sorts of onerous restrictions it
will not only not prevent this kind of incident but will spark an
uprising among the hundreds of thousands of general aviation
enthusiasts who are responsible and extremely safety-minded.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Halloran</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I read, with no small amount of dismay, about the knee-jerk
reaction calling for severe restrictions on general aviation in the
aftermath of the copycat plane crash in Florida. Instead of using an
airplane to end his tormented life, what if the boy had stolen a car
and crashed it into a hospital lobby? Would we then be demanding that
no cars be allowed within a mile of any public buildings? We cannot
let fear slowly erode the freedoms we enjoy in this country. Every
freedom that we lose to fear is another battle won by terrorism.</TE>

<LD>"Concentration camp" is the correct designation for Manzanar
("Manzanar Building to Be Visitor Center," Jan. 7). As a young boy I
met many former detainees of my own age and never believed it was
anything but a concentration camp.</LD>
<LD>   My wife and I visited the site in 1999, and I saw nothing there
that would have changed my opinion. The Museum of Eastern California
in Independence holds a large number of artifacts. Viewing these
relics was very instructive. We were also fortunate to see the Ansel
Adams photographic exhibit on the camp. The thing that hit home the
most was the faces of the children.</LD>
<LD>   I hope many will have the opportunity to visit the reconstructed
site and learn how civil liberties are sometimes sacrificed in the
name of patriotism. This is an event we all need to remember.</LD>

<LD>Michael Ramirez's Jan. 8 cartoon equating Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle with Sept. 11 attackers goes beyond bad taste. To equate
Daschle's economic ideas with murderous, terrorist actions suggests
to me that Ramirez thinks that normal political give and take, if it
does not bow down to our $1.3-trillion tax cut president, is a danger
to our nation. This cartoon is hateful and petty in the extreme.</LD>

<TE>   Typically I find Ramirez's cartoons simply unfunny and overly
obvious. But his Jan. 8 effort featuring a small plane hanging out
the side of the White House crossed the line into distasteful.
Mocking the suicide of a 15-year-old boy is truly offensive.</TE>

<HD>Iran's Role in Mideast Violence</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Stop Terror at Its Source: Iran," Commentary, Jan. 8: I cannot
comprehend how Yossi Klein Halevi imagines that our bombing Tehran
will cause democrats in Iran to overthrow the liberalizing government
of elected President Mohammad Khatami. Halevi's beef is with the
Iranian fundamentalists like Hashemi Rafsanjani, who uses hawkish
rhetoric to college students in an effort to reconvert them to holy
war.</LD>
<LD>   In today's inexorable escalation of the Mideast conflict to a
wider war in Asia, we cannot afford to listen to hawks in Israel,
Palestine or Iran. Yitzhak Rabin, like Khatami, attempted to take
risks for peace. Rabin was killed by ultra-hawks in his own society.
Similarly, Anwar Sadat was murdered by jihadists in Egypt who later
swelled the ranks of Al Qaeda. It is necessary to limit the war on
terrorism to bona fide terrorists hiding among large populations of
people who desire food, order, opportunity and hope. If Halevi
desires security for Israel, let him seek it as Rabin did by taking
risks for peace.</LD>

something here? The Israelis intercept a boat loaded with arms and
explosives; the captain, a longtime Fatah member, admits a
Palestinian official gave him the orders to load the ship, cross the
Suez Canal and disperse the contents to be landed in Palestinian
territory. He admits the ship was loaded off the coast of Iran,
helped by a Hezbollah member, and the cargo intended for
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Yet our State Department official said he did not know who hired
the ship and who were to be the recipients of this explosive cargo.

<LD>Re "CDs That Block Copying May Herald a Revolution," Jan. 6: When I
purchase compact discs for myself, I usually either listen to them
through my computer CD player or I convert them to MP3s and listen to
them on my portable MP3 player. This new copy-protection method will
basically prevent me and many others from listening to new CDs.</LD>
<LD>   For any given copy-protected CD, somebody out there will buy the
CD, use the analog signal to create a high-quality MP3 file (which
isn't all that difficult or time-consuming) and put it on the
Internet for all to download for free. And many will download the
songs instead of purchasing them, because these "hacked" downloaded
songs can now be played everywhere, as opposed to the limited-use
tracks on copy-protected CDs. How, exactly, is this supposed to
benefit the copyright holders?</LD>

<TE>   I have purchased approximately 450 or 500 CDs, some of which I
have played only once or twice. I then put the few songs on them that
I like onto a "miscellaneous" CD, making my own "best of" compilation
CD. That $15 CD gets put away, probably never to be played again. The
day that the record companies block copying of my own CDs (I do not
plan to go back to analog cassettes) is the day I have purchased my
last CD.</TE>

<LD>It's incredible that Catholics or anyone else would be offended at
the display in question ("Catholics Slam Napa Art Exhibit," Jan. 5).
I attended the Copia museum recently, and among the figurines was one
that looked just like me--a reasoned but aging atheist! It provoked a
guffaw similar to those expressed in my 9-year-old son's occasional
bathroom humor, but do I deny that my body functions like any other?
Of course not. The museum is about sustenance, and "pooping" is part
of that equation, no matter how religious fervor would demand that
some deny it.</LD>

would have given us a vision and objectively described where we are

everything that he touched was good and successful and that "over the
last three years" he had nothing to do with anything that didn't
work.</LD>

someone committed to the governorship lead California.</LD>

liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty
nor safety." In the wake of the tragedy of Sept. 11, we must take
pride in our liberties, for they are the very reason this great
country was attacked. Hopefully the citizens of the U.S. will not be
frightened into temporary solutions to terrorism that will strip them
of their rights.</TE>

<KH>Sundance Festival</KH>
<HD>New York City, a Main Character</HD>
<DH>More than a dozen entries are set in the city, but how
Sept. 11 affects the films' meaning is a debate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CLARK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>There's a documentary in competition at this year's Sundance Film
Festival, titled "Sister Helen," that features a 69-year-old
Benedictine nun who epitomizes everything many non-New Yorkers feel
about New York. Sister Helen runs a residence for substance abusers
in the worst part of the Bronx, and she's crusty, sarcastic,
overbearing, foul-mouthed and generally not interested in social
niceties. She's the spiritual equivalent of the classic New York
cabdriver.</LD>
<LD>   But there's another side to Sister Helen. She's a survivor and,
beneath that battle-ax exterior, a pushover. She tosses and turns one
night when the Major, one of her longtime tenants, tests positive for
an opiate. She breaks her own no-tolerance policy again and again for
a lovable but backsliding alcoholic. Arguably, this is the side of
New Yorkers and the city--the firemen in tears, the spontaneous
street memorials--that the rest of the country saw in the wake of
Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   "People have warmed up to New Yorkers," says "Sister Helen"
co-director Rob Fruchtman. "After Sept. 11, they see the character
behind the hard facade. This [Sister Helen] is a woman who appears to
be tough but who's caring underneath."</LD>
<TE>   Bertha Bay-Sa Pan, who directed "Face," a feature film in
competition at Sundance about several generations of Chinese American
women, set in Queens and Manhattan, says, "I think there is a
nostalgia or a special sentimentalism toward New York City that maybe
used to be more cynical."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, as "Face" makes clear, there are millions of New
Yorkers unlike Sister Helen, and they too are on display this year at
Sundance. More than a dozen festival films are set in the city, all
filmed before Sept. 11, and as such they document a place that no
longer exists, or at least is altered irrevocably. The filmmakers are
aware of this but divided about what it may mean for their movies.</TE>
<TE>   According to festival artistic director Geoffrey Gilmore, who
thinks there are more New York-based films here than usual, there's
something almost post-Sept. 11 about these films--meaning serious,
not frivolous or self-absorbed. The attacks are on a continuum of
disturbing news that filmmakers were already responding to, Gilmore
believes.</TE>
<TE>   "To me the issue goes back further than Sept. 11," he says. "I
think particularly at the end of the '90s you had very self-centered,
self-assured filmmakers whose work felt like navel-gazing. With their
material life assured, there wasn't the anxiety. The anxiety didn't
start over the last couple of months but with the millennium, the
elections and the disintegrating economy. And then the catastrophic
events of the last couple of months. These films are exploring the
real world."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the real world can overwhelm the cinematic world. Most
filmmakers kept in their shots of the World Trade Center and lived
with the consequences--one of them being that the images would take
the viewer out of the movie. Frank Whaley, who directed "The Jimmy
Show," set primarily in New Jersey, was an exception. He cut the
towers out of a scene because, however poignant, it was distracting.</TE>
<TE>   For Bart Freundlich, whose "World Traveler" is bookended by New
York, the city is his protagonist's home, and his concern before
Sept. 11 was that non-New Yorkers would have a hard time thinking of
it that way. Now, he says, it feels "like people's connection to New
York has strengthened and a lot of people might not have related to
New York as a home and now they can. You inevitably bring something
to the table, and it only enhances people's connection to the movie."</TE>
<TE>   Freundlich's shot of the towers is especially problematic because
it's aerial, crossing over the Statue of Liberty and then approaching
lower Manhattan--in other words, a flight path. Rather than alarming,
however, he finds it consoling, at least within the context of the
story, which is a tale of reconciliation.</TE>
<TE>   The same holds true, in a different way, for Anthony Jaswinski's
"Killing Time," about the odyssey of an architecture student who
journeys uptown for a job interview. New York's buildings are a
character in this film, which makes the appearance of the trade
center analogous to a much-beloved actor in a film who died before it
was released. Jaswinski says his film, which was intended to be
comedic, may not strike viewers as funny now. He found himself in the
editing room trading resonance for humor.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a feeling people are going to look at [the shots of the
towers] as a metaphor for what happened," Jaswinski says. "I have no
choice but to be OK with that. It's a poetic swan song to the city."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Mettei says his "Love in the Time of Money" was, in a sense,
nostalgic to begin with, since it is set at the height of the
dot-com-Nasdaq craze, when New Yorkers were absorbed in getting and
spending and unable to do much else (though his characters are an
exception). The bubble burst before Sept. 11, and the events since
then have only pushed this period further into the past. It's as if
the terrorist attacks had a telescoping effect.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, New York's all-consuming cyber-sex industry, which
forms the heart of Jeb Weintrob's "OnLine," is "not as brash as it
used to be," he says. But the conditions that gave rise to it have
not changed that much. "It's a community that's spatially tightly
knit, but people don't connect," says Weintrob. "There really is
something about living in this city that's analogous to living on the
Internet. People come here to reinvent themselves, and they do the
same things online."</TE>
<TE>   New York has always been the perfect place to dramatize the
concept of the Lonely Crowd. Sept. 11 changed that stereotype, if
only for a moment. However, despite what some of these films and
filmmakers suggest, New York is not simply a city of crusty
characters, emotionally and sexually starved loners or money-grubbing
status seekers.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, it's also a city of ethnic enclaves, where
everyone knows everyone and traditional values clash with
contemporary ones. Several films at Sundance feature these New
Yorkers and imply that the events of Sept. 11 may not have affected
them as much because they aren't as culturally, economically or
geographically tied to the trade center or the financial district.</TE>
<TE>   One such film is Eric Eason's "Manito," set in upper Manhattan's
Washington Heights, about a formerly drug-infested community whose
inhabitants are trying to clean up their act. Terrorism is not an
issue here. Jobs, day-care and schools are. Though Eason is at pains
to insist that this film is not a polemic, it does implicitly take
issue with the policies of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani--who became a
national hero after Sept. 11--for not providing social services along
with his highly successful policing. The attacks may have crowded the
city's problems and politics off the stage, but they're waiting in
the wings.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly what all of these films have in common is that living in
New York has always been, and always will be, a struggle. And no one
exemplifies this more than director Jill Sprecher, whose "Thirteen
Conversations About One Thing" is another film about city dwellers
trying to connect.</TE>
<TE>   Sprecher, who is from Wisconsin, was inspired to make the movie by
a number of nasty New York knocks. She was mugged twice within a
short period. The first time she received a black eye. The second
time the mugger broke a bottle over her head, requiring brain
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   After Sprecher was released from the hospital, a stranger walking
through a subway car she was on slapped her on the head. He kept
going as if nothing had happened. Sprecher says she burst into tears
while the other riders remained buried behind their
newspapers--except for one, who, having caught her eye, made as if to
follow the guy, then sat back down and smiled at her.</TE>
<TE>   "I was carrying around a lot of anger and hostility," she says.
"People are real jerks. But that sort of restored my faith in
people."</TE>
<TE>   Sprecher and her sister, Karen, who co-wrote the film, are living
in Los Angeles, mostly because they can't afford to return to New
York, where they have an apartment, and also because they lost a good
friend at the World Trade Center. Asked if whether, after all this,
she intends to return, Sprecher says, "We're going to end up in New
York. We love New York. It's the place I always wanted to live.</TE>
<TE>   "There's something wonderful about the city. I think the
underlying message of my film is that you can get a feeling of
connection to people in the city, and I think there are people there
who've proved that."</TE>

<HD>A Story Right Out of Hollywood--Only It's Not</HD>
<DH>Movies* The strong response to 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham'
at home in India and abroad has observers reassessing the potential
of South Asian films.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAVITA DASWANI</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An epic-length movie that is virtually unknown outside South Asian
communities has become the highest-grossing Indian-language film in
history. "Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham"--which translates literally into
"Sometimes Happy Sometimes Sad" and is referred to colloquially as
"K3G"--is, with a budget of $10 million, the most expensive movie
ever made in India. It broke box-office records in its opening
weekend there and remained the No. 1 draw for its first three weeks
in theaters.</LD>
<LD>   The 31/2-hour production took in $1 million in its opening week in
Bombay alone, up against such Western films as "Rush Hour 2,"
"Bridget Jones's Diary" and "America's Sweethearts." After a
$1.37-million North American opening weekend, it had, by last
weekend, brought in close to $3 million in North America, more than
any South Asian film, said Jawahar Sharma, head of North American
operations for Yash Raj Films, international distributor for "K3G."</LD>
<LD>   In the United Kingdom, where much of "K3G" was shot, it brought in
500,000 pounds in its first week, placing it at No. 3 on the nation's
box-office list--two places down from "Harry Potter."</LD>
<TE>   "We will keep on playing the movie until it has reached its
potential," Sharma said.</TE>
<TE>   "The enormous success of 'K3G' is due primarily to three reasons:
star power, marketing and timing," said Gitesh Pandya, a South Asian
film producer based in New York and editor of BoxOfficeGuru.com.</TE>
<TE>   Karan Johar, 30, also wrote and directed the previous top-grossing
South Asian film, 1998's "Kuch Kuch Hota Hai," which translates
roughly as "Something Is Happening." India's most sought-after
director, he attracted six of the country's most popular stars to
"K3G."</TE>
<TE>   Appearing together for the first time in decades are Amitabh
Bachchan, a legend in the South Asian film industry (he has been
immortalized at Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum in London) and his wife,
Jaya, who came out of retirement to play the role as Bachchan's
character's spouse. In addition, Johar cast Indian sex symbol Hrithik
Roshan and Shah Rukh Khan, another young male box-office draw in
India. Rounding out the cast are actresses Kajol and Kareena Kapoor,
the latter a scion of an Indian acting dynasty.</TE>
<TE>   The assembled cast, in American terms, would be akin to getting
together Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts, Cameron Diaz,
Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando.</TE>
<TE>   South Asian audiences everywhere have embraced the plot. The
movie's marketing line is "It's all about loving your parents." In a
wealthy U.K.-based family, a foster son leaves home after marrying a
girl not of his parents' choosing. The younger son and his girlfriend
subsequently work on bringing the clan back together again. Jaya
Bachchan's role as a nonsubmissive, tell-it-like-it-is tycoon's wife
proved a departure for the traditional mother roles.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very entertaining," said Dimple Patel, a Beverly Hills
woman who saw "K3G" as soon as it was released. "It's a long film,
but you don't really feel it."</TE>
<TE>   The film encompasses opulent scenes featuring English country
estates, noted venues around Bombay and even some select scenes in
Egypt--as well as lush song-and-dance numbers and designer wardrobes.</TE>
<TE>   Nikhil Advani, the Bombay-based assistant director, said that the
British scenes were shot in locales like Hyde Park, Leicester Square
and the British Museum, as well as stately venues like Blenheim
Palace in Woodstock and Waddesdon Manor in Aylesbury.</TE>
<TE>   Watchers of the South Asian industry say the success of "K3G" has
much to do with a family-driven story being sought after in these
uncertain times.</TE>
<TE>   "People seem to be looking for more family-oriented films," said
Kiran Rao, founder of HollywoodMasala.com, which tracks happenings in
the South Asian movie industry. "There is an old-style family
romanticism here."</TE>
<TE>   "K3G" was released on Dec.14 on 600 screens in India and 200
overseas; the international prints were all subtitled. In England, it
has been showing in Indian-centric cities such as Southall and
Leicester, in addition to more mainstream cinemas in London.</TE>
<TE>   The film is also playing at select theaters in Belgium, Holland,
Germany and Norway. Seventy-three prints were released for North
America, where it is showing in traditional South Asian areas like
Artesia and Cerritos in the Southland, as well as in Northridge and
Laguna Hills. It's playing at the Loews in New York City's Times
Square, AMC theaters in Chicago and at Imax in Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   "I've talked to people who have seen it more than twice, who say
that once is not enough to take it all in," said Yash Raj Films'
Sharma.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very wholesome film which caters to everyone in the
family. Certainly in overseas markets, there was nothing like this
during the holidays," Sharma said. Sharma noticed also that audiences
beyond South Asian communities were taking to "K3G." At the Times
Square venue, he said a "sizable number of the audience was
non-Asian. "They come out of curiosity and walk out seeing something
they have never seen before--the colors, the music." An event to
launch the movie's soundtrack was held recently in New York; the
recording is already a hit in India.</TE>
<TE>   In India, critics have been as kind as audiences. The Times of
India, the country's most established daily newspaper, said of "K3G":
"In the realm of the much-vilified and rarely saluted commercial
cinema, here is a polished product which presses all the right
buttons without ever dithering." Critic Khalid Mohammed described it
as an "opulently mounted family drama" that was "staunchly
traditional and hip-hop trendy."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the South Asian entertainment community in the U.S. are
encouraged by the success of "K3G."</TE>
<TE>   "It just shows how much potential is there," said Vipul Gupta, a
Michigan-based business and entertainment consultant working on
introducing South Asian stars into mainstream American entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   "Indian actors and actresses are very talented, very attractive,
and something like this presents tremendous opportunities to get them
into Hollywood. Some of the dancing and singing elements can catch
the fancy of non-Asian audiences. I think we're going to be seeing
more crossover, just the way we've been seeing with other Asian and
Chinese films."</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone I have spoken to loved it," said BoxOfficeGuru.com's
Pandya. "It's a record performance for a Bollywood film and a sign of
how lucrative the South Asian audience is in the U.K. and North
America."</TE>

<HD>Silents Golden Again</HD>
<DH>Classics films that predate the first talkies are enjoying
a renaissance across the nation. Fans say the films' creaky
reputation is undeserved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ENDERS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LINCOLN CITY, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Idela Warton's eyes light up when she talks about the silent film
era--her era. At 87, she remembers the pre-talkie days.</LD>
<LD>   "I can remember going to see them with my parents," said Warton,
standing in line at the Bijou Theater to see Ramon Novarro's 1928
"Forbidden Hours," the silent film's first public showing in 73
years.</LD>
<LD>   "Charlie Chaplin was my favorite. And Rudolph Valentino."</LD>
<TE>   Warton is not alone. In recent years, movie buffs have flocked to
silent film festivals in Italy, London and San Francisco, and to
organ- or orchestra-accompanied showings of classics in renovated
film "palaces" in Los Angeles; Atlanta; Syracuse, N.Y.; and Jersey
City, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   It's a virtual renaissance of silent film, spurred, observers say,
by Turner Classic Movies' decision five years ago to show a weekly
feature on "Silent Sunday Night."</TE>
<TE>   "They have shown the audience silent films are not beat-up
Keystone Kops stuff," said Richard P. May, vice president for film
preservation at Warner Bros., which, like Turner, is part of AOL Time
Warner.</TE>
<TE>   Turner, which owns MGM's film library, has about 100 silent films
that have never been musically scored. In addition to cable-casting
"Silent Sunday Night," TCM has commissioned young musicians and
professionals to write music for the silent films, and has created
documentaries about some of the silent stars, including Lon Chaney,
Clara Bow and Louise Brooks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really jazzed about our ability to bring some of these films
back into circulation," said Tom Karsch, executive vice president and
general manager of Turner Classic Movies. "It's important to make
sure [the public] understands how much of the rich product is out
there."</TE>
<TE>   Numerous Web sites devoted to silent films have sprung up in the
last several years.</TE>
<TE>   Diane MacIntyre, president of an online journal called the Silents
Majority, said that when that site went up in 1996, there were just
five or six such sites. Today, there are more than 100, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't put the pages up fast enough. We have consistently
gotten over 300,000 page views a month for nearly three years," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1893, when Thomas Alva Edison built his first moving
picture studio, the Black Mariah, in New Jersey, and 1927, when "The
Jazz Singer" with Al Jolson was released as the world's first talkie,
silent films grew quickly, in popularity and sophistication.</TE>
<TE>   Early silents were short and jerky. But by the time such classics
as F.W. Murnau's "Nosferatu" (1922), Charlie Chaplin's "The Gold
Rush" (1925) and Sergei Eisenstein's "Battleship Potemkin" (1925)
came along, silents had grown to full-length majestic cinematic
masterpieces.</TE>
<TE>   "All the technical developments of the cinema were developed by
the end of the silent days," said Kevin Brownlow of London, who has
dedicated his life to silent film and has written the definitive
history, "The Parade's Gone By."</TE>
<TE>   Zoom, quick cutting, camera movement: "They'd done it all by
1929," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But when talking films emerged, many studios intentionally played
down silent films because they figured the two media could not
coexist, Brownlow said.</TE>
<TE>   Many silents were deliberately reissued at the wrong speed to
undermine their popularity, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "People got the impression they were idiotically antique,
something ludicrous. That's still in the minds of people in their 50s
and 60s," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To be fully appreciated, silent films should be shown at the right
speed, with live music and in a "palace" setting. Today's audiences
seem to love the comedies most.</TE>
<TE>   "They laugh. They can boo and hiss at the villain, and they can
clap and cheer the hero. People get so involved," said Rick Parks, a
39-year-old organist who accompanies many films at the Elsinore
Theater in Salem, Ore., and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the silent films have decomposed over time, said Warner's
May. Before 1951, all films were nitrate-based. Those that have been
preserved are transferred to polyester-based film.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time of the changeover to sound, many, many films had
absolutely no [commercial] value," May said. "There were thousands of
films made, and nobody kept them."</TE>
<TE>   MGM was a forerunner in preservation, May said.</TE>
<TE>   "The production quality was first class, and if the film was
preserved properly, the production quality shows still today," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   At the Bijou here, manager Matias Bombal, who has promoted silents
at various West Coast theaters since 1989, said the showing of
"Forbidden Hours" was a symbolic first.</TE>
<TE>   It disappeared from theaters soon after its release, pushed aside
by the talkies.</TE>
<TE>   The film was kept in MGM's vaults for decades and recently was
rediscovered by an author working on a biography of Novarro, a
Mexican-born actor who was the star of the 1925 classic "Ben Hur."</TE>
<TE>   "This film was forgotten even in its own time," Bombal said.</TE>
<TE>   Bombal believes silent films, combining film with live music in
pomp and bombast, are unlike any other theatrical offering.</TE>
<TE>   "Silent films require total attention from the viewer," Bombal
said. "You cannot look away, or you will miss key elements of what is
happening on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   "It becomes a very intimate, personal thing."</TE>

<HD>Beyond Giant Stone Heads: A Rare Look at Easter Island</HD>
<DH>Art* An exhibition gathers sculptures and other items
reflecting the remote area's religion and society. Some pieces are
the last of their kind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEEPTI HAJELA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It was, once upon a time, one of the most isolated places in the
world--Rapa Nui, or Easter Island.</LD>
<LD>   More than 2,400 miles from Tahiti or Chile, the South American
country to which it belongs, the triangle-shaped island in the South
Pacific became home centuries ago to people who populated it with
giant stone statues representing their gods and ancient chieftains.</LD>
<LD>   Now, one of those stone heads and almost 50 other items showcasing
the scope of Easter Island's artistic history are being exhibited at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the first museum retrospective of
such work in North America.</LD>
<TE>   "Splendid Isolation: Art of Easter Island" runs through August.
Taken from institutes and private collections in the United States
and Canada, the exhibition contains wooden sculptures, inscribed
tablets and bark-cloth figures that reflect the people of Easter
Island's ancient religious beliefs and societal customs. Some of the
pieces are the last of their kind.</TE>
<TE>   The art in this exhibition wasn't made merely as an exercise in
creativity for the artist, but served as signs of social rank or were
for use in religious practices, said curator Eric Kjellgren. He
compared that role to the art of the Middle Ages in Europe, with its
religious connotations.</TE>
<TE>   "The images were primarily made to adorn a sacred site," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So, along with the stone head that opens the show and was taken
from a temple, there are the bird men. These carvings, with the heads
of birds on human bodies, have been identified as images of Makemake,
the island's creator god.</TE>
<TE>   Other carvings reflect the owners' societal status. There is the
staff, almost 5 feet long, that would have been carried by a chief.
Also included are the gorgets, large, wooden half-moon pendants meant
to be worn by powerful female leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are works that demonstrate cultural norms. A figure
made out of bark cloth has tattoo markings around the neck like those
Rapa Nui warriors would have worn. And there are the tablets, covered
in the marks of the island's language, Rongorongo.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the pieces, such as the inscribed tablets, are among the
last surviving ones, mirroring the decline of the island's population
and its troubled history.</TE>
<TE>   Rapa Nui, covering about 65 miles in land mass, was first settled
somewhere around 600 to 800 by people hailing from the islands of the
central Pacific. It would be about 1,000 years before a European
explorer came across them; in that time, the great stone figures, or
moai, were carved out of the volcanic rock that formed the island,
and the island's trees were cut down to make log rollers or sledges
to transport them.</TE>
<TE>   As the trees came down, it became more difficult for the island to
sustain its population, which started to shrink from an estimated
7,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   There were about 2,000 to 3,000 people on the island when Dutch
explorer Jacob Roggeveen arrived on Easter Sunday in 1722. During the
next 150 years or so, due to disease, immigration or kidnapping for
labor, the population continued to drop, until there were only 111
people on the island in 1870, Kjellgren said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of information about the culture was lost with that
population crash," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There has been a resurgence of people on the island, which is now
part of Chile. Kjellgren said there are about 4,000 residents, about
half descending from the original settlers.</TE>
<TE>   But the damage remains. For example, while Rongorongo is still
spoken, no one can read it, so inscribed tablets like the ones in the
exhibition are indecipherable.</TE>
<TE>   Of the art forms that remain, such as wood carving, the emphasis
has changed from carving images of the ancient gods to commercial
purposes, Kjellgren said.</TE>
<TE>   "The imagery was primarily religious in nature. That link was
broken with the conversion to Christianity" that took place in the
19th century, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition doesn't have any examples of contemporary pieces,
as it isn't trying to feature the entire history of Rapa Nui art.
Instead, it aims to introduce people who might only have known of the
giant stone heads the diversity of what the people of Easter Island
created.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal is to include the stone figures but move beyond them to
other art," Kjellgren said.</TE>

<LD>The International Assn. for Jazz Education kicked off its 29th annual
conference at the Long Beach Convention Center on Wednesday with a
fairly light schedule of events that only hinted at the busy
collection of concerts, panels, clinics and research presentations
planned for the following three days.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the minimal number of clinics and panels, however, the
lineup of performances was fully up to speed. In fact, the stylistic
genres gathered for the opening day seemed cleverly designed to
display the full breadth of jazz at the dawn of the 21st century.</LD>
<LD>   There were, for example, the small ensembles of the Winard Harper
Sextet and the Christine Jensen Sextet (the latter showcasing
saxophonist Jensen with her trumpet-playing sister, Ingrid Jensen).
There was the large ensemble of Gordon Goodwin--the Big Phat
Band--performing with a guest artist, veteran saxophonist-flutist
James Moody. There was a nod in the direction of fusion and funk with
a group featuring trumpeter Rick Braun, tenor saxophonist Kirk
Whalum, guitarist Norman Brown and organist Ricky Peterson. And there
was the melting-pot combination of urban pop sounds and jazz
improvisation offered by Russell Gunn and Ethnomusicology.</LD>
<TE>   Coursing through this colorful assemblage of music were some
impressive individual moments. The Big Phat Band, for example, has
established itself over the past year as one of the Southland's most
craftsman-like hard-swinging large jazz ensembles, galvanized by
Goodwin's witty and insightful arrangements and compositions. But the
presence of Moody, romping through three classic jazz testing
points--"Cherokee," "Body and Soul" and "Take the 'A' Train"--took
everything up a level. The fusion ensemble of Braun, Brown, Whalum
and Peterson, offering a musical genre not often heard at this event,
seemed to vacillate between the backbeat rhythms of instrumental pop
and somewhat more enterprising musical excursions.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>OK, I know that New Year's resolutions are supposed to have been
locked in on the first of the year. (I am also well aware that many
of them already have been, shall we say, set aside.)</LD>
<LD>   But it occurred to me that there were a few resolutions which--if
they weren't set aside--could generate some productive results for
jazz and for the jazz community. So, even though no one has asked me,
here are some of my off-the-cuff recommendations:</LD>
<LD>   * Diana Krall and Tommy LiPuma. Resolution: To make the next one a
jazz album.</LD>
<TE>   * Quincy Jones. Resolution: Ditto. The autobiography is finished,
the boxed collection of career overview recordings has been released.
So ... time for another jazz outing. Please, Q?</TE>
<TE>   * Wynton Marsalis. Resolution: To keep on keeping on. No matter
what your critics (including this one) have to say.</TE>
<TE>   * The International Assn. for Jazz Education. Resolutions: To
continue to support and encourage the education and the appreciation
of jazz. To not allow the big picture to overshadow the fine points,
especially the fundamental dilemma that the number of academically
trained jazz musicians vastly exceeds the number of jobs available
for them. To make sure that the mentorship, in-the-trenches learning
style that produced most of the great jazz artists of the 20th
century continues to hold a vital position in the lexicon of jazz
education.</TE>
<TE>   * Jazz record companies. Resolutions: To do a better job of
supporting your product. To realize that simply tossing CDs into a
market overflowing with albums will most likely mean that they will
quickly sink beneath the surface of visibility. To work more
empathetically with managers and publicists to create the best
possible awareness for artists' work.</TE>
<TE>   * Film documentarians (perhaps Ric Burns?). Resolutions: To
document the 40 years of jazz history minimized or omitted in the Ken
Burns "Jazz" series. To acknowledge that anyone who thinks it's not
possible to find a historical perspective for the period either
hasn't been paying attention to the music or has been listening to
the wrong advisors.</TE>
<TE>   * The L.A. Philharmonic and the Music Center. Resolutions: To
realize the importance of jazz in the cultural life of the city, the
country and the world. To recognize that Los Angeles is home to a
community of jazz artists rivaled only by New York City's. To
understand that this combination of circumstances creates
extraordinary opportunities comparable--if different in style and
substance--to what Wynton Marsalis encountered when he initiated Jazz
at Lincoln Center. To do something with those opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   * UCLA Live. Resolution: To become aware that jazz is perfectly
capable of standing on its own, without pop culture framing or
interfacing. To restore UCLA's performing arts schedule to the
prominent Los Angeles destination for jazz audiences that it once
was.</TE>
<TE>   * L.A.'s balkanized jazz organizations. Resolutions: To get to
know one another--at the very least. To make the decision that the
geographic vastness of the Southland, with its many communities,
doesn't have to be reflected in fragmented support for the music. To
work toward creating a jazz umbrella association that will combine
the resources of individual organizations in a fashion that best
serves the needs of Southland jazz artists, rather than the
organizations' internal agendas.</TE>
<TE>   * L.A. jazz audiences. Resolutions: To make the effort, at least
every month or two, to go out and hear something new. To be receptive
to unfamiliar young players and take a chance with thorny musical
styles. To visit a club or a concert hall outside one's familiar
routine.</TE>
<TE>   * Button pushers, dial twisters and fader sliders (more precisely
known as audio engineers). Resolutions: To learn how a jazz group
should sound. To understand that, unlike rock music, jazz does not
benefit from amplification of bass, drums and guitar to a level that
can blow away the sound of five trumpets and four trombones. To make
the best possible effort to allow the musicians to create their own
dynamic levels without your intrusion.</TE>
<TE>   * Whoopers and screamers. OK, we probably can't ask you to stifle
your enthusiasm and save the eardrums of anyone within 10 yards of
your seat. But how about this resolution: that you'll at least
control yourself long enough in the closing passages of a piece to
allow it to come to a natural conclusion, without inserting your
personality into the music?</TE>
<TE>   * Bandleaders (everywhere). Resolution: To announce the names of
your musicians when the crowd is quiet, not when there's so much
applause that it's impossible to hear anything you say. After all,
without them, you'd be a solo act.</TE>
<TE>   * Jazz journalists (including the one who writes this column).
Resolutions: To review what you're hearing, not what you think you
should be hearing. To review players, not audiences. To remember that
there's very little that you can say about a performance that is not
already fully apparent to the musicians. And to keep in mind that
there's probably a lot more that the musicians are aware of that has
completely eluded you.</TE>
<TE>   Riffs: Film composer-arranger Patrick Williams, winner of four
Emmys, two Grammys and an Academy Award nomination for his scores,
has been appointed artistic director of the Henry Mancini Institute.
He succeeds institute founder Jack Elliott, who died last summer.
Williams' first official appearance with the HMI Alumni Orchestra
takes place today at 11 a.m. at the Terrace Theatre in the Long Beach
Convention Center as part of the 29th annual International Assn. for
Jazz Education conference.... Pianist-composer Michael Melvoin will
fill another of Elliott's former posts on Feb. 27, when he takes over
as musical director of the 2002 Grammy Awards show. Melvoin's newest
jazz CD, "Oh, Baby," is due for release next week on the City Lights
label.</TE>

<HD>For Martha Plimpton, Acting Is Really the Only Choice</HD>
<DH>Theater* It's not a question of movie stardom versus
lower-profile work for the ex-child star who's happy to act in a New
York play.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Young people who want to pursue an acting career often must decide
whether they aspire to become movie stars or actors. For Martha
Plimpton, it was a Hobson's choice.</LD>
<LD>   The child of actors and a child star in her own right, Plimpton
naturally gravitated toward the career with less champagne, fewer
flashbulbs popping around her and much less cash.</LD>
<LD>   It was her mom--Shelley Plimpton of "Alice's Restaurant" and
"Putney Swope"--who made the alternatives ahead clear. No daughter of
hers should choose money over art, she used to say.</LD>
<TE>   "She wasn't going to encourage me to sell myself short that
early," the younger Plimpton recalls. "She recognized that I was
going to have a long life past the age of 13 and that I should
probably be thinking about my future, more than just financially."</TE>
<TE>   That's why during a recent interview before a performance of her
latest play, Plimpton is found wolfing down bites of a Subway
sandwich in the lobby of a chilly lower Manhattan theater. It's not
exactly Spago, but she seems proudly happy anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm working very hard and I feel good about the work that I'm
doing--and I prefer it this way," she says. "I mean, it would be nice
to be really, really rich. But really would it?"</TE>
<TE>   Plimpton, 31, stars in the appropriately titled "Hobson's Choice,"
a comedy by Harold Brighouse set in 1880 England that centers on
wealth, class and family. The cast also includes Brian Murray, David
Aaron Baker and Peter Maloney.</TE>
<TE>   Plimpton plays Maggie Hobson, the headstrong elder daughter of a
middle-class boot maker who schemes to match-make her sisters and
protect her father's business, all with heavy doses of tough love.
For Maggie, it's basically her way or the highway.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard because Maggie is sort of on top of everything,
surveying the action. But at the same time propelling it and also
coming up with these plans," Plimpton says. "It's hard not to get
complacent."</TE>
<TE>   David Warren, the show's director, says Plimpton has breathed life
into a tricky role, managing to convey a sense of authority without
sacrificing her openness and humor.</TE>
<TE>   "What she has naturally is power and strength. She's also very
vulnerable and very warm and very kind. She seems to have both of
them at the same time," Warren says. "Maybe that's why she's so
special."</TE>
<TE>   Plimpton has used those skills to tackle everything from
mainstream Hollywood fare--"The Goonies," "Running on Empty" and
"Parenthood"--to indies such as "Eye of God," "200 Cigarettes" and
John Waters' "Pecker."</TE>
<TE>   But it's been the stage where Plimpton has lately enjoyed a
renaissance. After working with the Seattle Repertory Theatre and
Joseph Papp Public Theater, she has spent much of the past few years
with the acclaimed Chicago-based Steppenwolf Theater Company.</TE>
<TE>   There she starred in John Malkovich's 1996 production of "The
Libertine" as well as "The Playboy of the Western World," "The Glass
Menagerie" and "Hedda Gabler." Earlier this year she made her
directing debut with "Absolution."</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Plimpton was taken to lunch by Steppenwolf's artistic
director and casually asked to join the successful ensemble. She
would work alongside such actors as Gary Sinise, Joan Allen and
Laurie Metcalf.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really overcome. I was incredibly honored and so excited
and really felt affirmed. I've been able to do things there that I
never would have been able to do anywhere else," she says. "It's
brought me an incredible amount of encouragement."</TE>
<TE>   From a Long</TE>
<TE>   Line of Actors</TE>
<TE>   Joining Steppenwolf, which Plimpton likens to working at "a nice,
family-owned organic farm," has offered her an artistic home, the
collegiality of a group of dedicated performers and the chance to
grow as an actor.</TE>
<TE>   Plimpton virtually has show biz in her veins. Besides her mother,
a former actress, her father is Keith Carradine ("The Will Rogers
Follies," "Nashville") and her grandfather was John Carradine
("Stagecoach," "The Grapes of Wrath" and "The Ten Commandments").</TE>
<TE>   Conceived while her parents were in New York for a Broadway run of
"Hair," Plimpton was soon sucked into the child acting machine,
producing much of the work with which she is still recognized. "To
most of the people on the subway, I'm viewed as that 'Goonie' girl,"
she says.</TE>
<TE>   After entering adulthood, Plimpton revisited her decision to pick
the hardscrabble life of an actress over movie stardom. She soon
decided that her mom was right--sort of.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized ... as I got older that I could choose to be an actor
to a certain extent, but movie stardom is not something you choose.
It chooses you. You have very little control over that," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "So I stopped considering that an option when I realized, 'You
know what? I've been working a really long time. I've been doing this
since I was 8. I'm too tired, I'm too old.' If it chooses me, it
chooses me. If not, not. I'm not sweating it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 31 now, which in Hollywood terms is ripe. Unless you're
really established in that mainstream Hollywood way, 31 is a hard age
for a character actress," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if she feels her experiences on stage, in big-budget films
and small independent projects have left her feeling more seasoned
than your typical actress, Plimpton smiles.</TE>
<TE>   "A little too much cumin," she says.</TE>

<KH>Movie Review</KH>
<HD>This Novel Idea Gets an Incomplete</HD>
<DH>'Orange County,' featuring a host of winning comic actors,
barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Orange County" starts out deliriously funny but allows
sentimentality to squeeze it to a pulp by the time it's over. It's
the old Hollywood sellout, yet surely the people who laugh during its
first half are prepared to go the distance with its deadpan take on
the obtuse absurdities of human nature and upscale suburban
life--especially one with such winning central performances by Colin
Hanks and Schuyler Fisk.</LD>
<LD>   Hanks' Shaun Brumder is at first one of the surfer dudes in a posh
seaside Orange County community (though the film was actually shot in
the San Fernando Valley). However, when he sees one of his pals
killed trying to ride a humongous wave, the shocked and grieving
Shaun discovers a book half-buried in the sand that transforms his
life. The novel speaks to him the way "Catcher in the Rye" did to
kids in the '50s. He becomes determined to (a) become a writer, using
his own life experiences as source material; and (b) attend Stanford,
where the novel's writer (Kevin Kline, unbilled) teaches.</LD>
<TE>   Since Shaun is so bright that he got good grades even when surfing
was his main interest, it would seem he wouldn't have much difficulty
attaining his dream. The trouble is he's surrounded by individuals
steeped in self-absorbed indifference if not outright stupidity.
First, there's Lily Tomlin's high school counselor, who has the
attention span of a gnat and gets Shaun's transcript mixed up with
that of a mediocre student.</TE>
<TE>   Realizing how stunned Shaun is by his rejection from Stanford,
Shaun's lovely, levelheaded girlfriend Ashley (Fisk) sets about
blackmailing one of their classmates into having her grandfather
(Garry Marshall), who holds an influential position in one of the
university's key organizations, agree to meet Sean in order to solve
his problem.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for Shaun, his extravagantly dysfunctional family
can't get its act together for the duration of the meeting. His wacky
mother (Catherine O'Hara), embittered by her husband (John Lithgow)
dumping her for a twentysomething playgirl he met at his gym, gets
drunk, and his brother Lance (Jack Black), a paunchy druggie, also
reels out of control. Lance decides to make amends by driving Shaun
and Ashley up to Stanford to plead his case in person to the dean of
admissions (Harold Ramis).</TE>
<TE>   So far so good, as screenwriter Mike White keeps piling on the
wild and crazy antics--including an amusing cameo by White himself as
an English teacher who thinks Claire Danes is the name most
associated with "Romeo and Juliet"--and director Jake Kasdan keeps
everything barreling along. However, when Shaun glimpses his hallowed
novelist, "Orange County" starts to unravel swiftly, undercutting the
satire and wicked observation that has come before. (How dispiriting
it is to realize  this is the same White who wrote the dazzlingly
uncompromising "Chuck &amp; Buck.")</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to Thomas Wolfe's famous admonition, "You can't go
home again," the moral of "Orange County" would seem to be that you
shouldn't leave in the first place. In any event, this films stirs up
nonsense just to make picayune points: You don't have to leave Orange
County to be a writer; if you see people in the round their plusses
and minuses most likely balance out. The equation, though, is too
lopsided on the side of nihilism to be so easily squared away.</TE>
<TE>   This suburban sub-"Candide" balderdash for teens has virtually no
connection with the actual Orange County or Stanford. Its view of
high school life among the privileged classes is generic, and the
atmosphere is that of any ritzy Southern California coastal community
between Santa Barbara and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   O'Hara and Black could give courses on comic expressiveness and
timing. Hanks, the son of Tom, and Fisk, the daughter of Sissy Spacek
and production designer Jack Fisk, are splendid arguments that talent
can be inherited. But Kasdan could learn a few lessons about the
perils of working with material that sells itself short from his
father, esteemed writer-director-producer Lawrence Kasdan, who has
spent a career pretty much avoiding that pitfall.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for drug content, language and sexuality.
Times guidelines: The sexuality is pretty tame,  language routine,
but  substance abuse is considerable.</TE>

<HD>Once-Ailing Laguna Museum Paints a Rosy Future for Itself</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five years after a bitter merger attempt, the Laguna Art Museum has
emerged as a survivor: It has rebuilt its fiscal strength, heightened
its artistic profile and has begun planning a new look designed to
make the best of its seaside location.</LD>
<LD>   "Some of our sponsors fell off, and it's taken a while before
we've been able to rebuild it," LAM director Bolton Colburn said. "A
lot of it has to do with a renewed community support for the
institution where a lot of that had dropped away during the merger
ordeal."</LD>
<LD>   In 1996, the Laguna museum had to make a tough decision: Face
insolvency or merge with the Newport Harbor Art Museum. The merger
called for LAM to transfer its collections, raze its building and
forsake its name to become part of a new entity, the Orange County
Museum of Art.</LD>
<TE>   Angered LAM members intervened with lawsuits, and Laguna broke
away to operate independently, though it continues to share a
3,800-piece collection with OCMA. The museums also settled on an
equal division of a $2-million endowment.</TE>
<TE>   LAM retained its name, its historic site on the bluffs along
Pacific Coast Highway and its independence--it is one of three
prominent visual arts institutions in the county along with the
Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana and OCMA. Yet its
operating budget in 1997 was only $229,000.</TE>
<TE>   Today, its financial outlook is stronger. Its endowment is $1.2
million and its operating budget is $1.3 million (OCMA's is nearly
triple that). And LAM has made strides in reducing its deficit from a
recent high of $169,300 for fiscal year 1999-2000, to $67,000 in
2000-01, the latest figures released by the museum.</TE>
<TE>   Still in the Red,</TE>
<TE>   but Gaining Strength</TE>
<TE>   "We've been going in the red because we were extremely
conservative in the first couple of years to build up our coffers. We
took a hit for a couple of years, but we expected that as part of our
growth, to reestablish our programs and exhibitions schedule," said
Colburn, who started with the museum as a curator and stepped up as
director after the merger.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its modest means today, the museum has managed to reassert
itself. It has 1,700 members and hosts 30,000 visitors each year. In
July 2000, its permanent collection was doubled with a gift of 517
works by Peter Krasnow, making it the primary repository of works by
this Los Angeles Modernist. San Fernando Valley-based collectors
Stuart and Judy Spence gave the museum 109 works by California
contemporary artists in May 1999. The same year, Santa Monica-based
collectors Peter and Eileen Norton donated 124 works by young
California artists, in a nationwide dispersal of part of their
holdings.</TE>
<TE>   According to Colburn, the 1999 hiring of exhibitions curator Tyler
Stallings, a CalArts graduate and former curator of the Huntington
Beach Art Center, has been a key factor in heightening the museum's
artistic profile, creating shows that have received favorable reviews
and increased attendance.</TE>
<TE>   "Presence Control," a site-specific 2001 installation by artist
Stephen Hendee brought to the museum by Stallings, was described by
Times art critic Christopher Knight as "savvy, modest, quietly
engaging ... [offering] surprising satisfactions." Sandow Birk's 2000
show "In Smog and Thunder: Historical Works From the Great War of the
Californias," curated by Stallings for LAM, was called "thoroughly
calculated and terrifically amusing," by Leah Ollman, writing for The
Times.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Stallings received a $50,000 grant from the Fellows of
Contemporary Art, a Los Angeles-based independent support
organization that offers annual funding for exhibitions focused on
California art. It will be used for a 2003 exhibition on themes of
race and identity and will include works by Chris Burden, Tom of
Finland, Tran Trang, Mike Kelley, Barbara Kruger and Ruben Ortiz
Torres.</TE>
<TE>   Stallings is the fourth Fellows grant recipient from the Laguna
Art Museum--the most from any museum in California, according to
Merry Scully, the organization's former administrative director.</TE>
<TE>   LAM has also picked up support from Hollywood celebrities.
Leonardo DiCaprio underwrote an exhibit on painter-sculptor Stanislav
Szukalski in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 9, the museum will host "Art for AIDS--A Tribute to Rock
Hudson," a charity fund-raiser event with Elizabeth Taylor and
Michael Jackson. Proceeds will be shared, and organizers hope to
raise $50,000 for the museum.</TE>
<TE>   Such fund-raisers--up to four from three per year--and an
estimated $50,000 increase in donor contributions in fiscal year
2000-01 (such contributions had been flat at $136,000 for the two
prior years) are expected to further ease the museum's deficit. LAM
also expects to receive $80,000 in revenues from a citywide hotel bed
tax, approved last year by Laguna Beach to support the arts.</TE>
<TE>   Plans to Renovate,</TE>
<TE>   Expand Its Building</TE>
<TE>   Now, the museum is looking forward with hopes of renovating and
expanding its building, possibly within the next five years. A
feasibility study, funded by a $10,000 grant from the Orange
County-based Segerstrom Foundation, was conducted last year by Laguna
Beach architectural firm Teller Manok. It calls for the addition of a
lower-level gallery that can also be used as a small, multipurpose
education area and theater. Named the Segerstrom Family Gallery, it
is estimated to cost $350,000 to $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   The firm also proposed a face lift to the front lobby, replacing
the smoked-glass windows with a patio area, visible from all three
sides of the museum, that takes advantage of the foot and car
traffic--42,000 motorists pass by daily. A cafe service area on the
museum's rooftop would look out over the Pacific Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an extremely valuable site," Colburn said. "One of the
big problems is that the facade, and [the] structure itself, doesn't
invite people into it, and it's not recognized right away as a
museum.</TE>
<TE>   "The most exciting thing for the museum at this moment is that it
needs to change its physical structure. And it's doable," said
Colburn. "We're turning this museum around, and we expect it to keep
on growing."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Mike Boehm contributed to this story.</TE>

<HD>Master P Shrugs Off the Limits</HD>
<DH>Pop music* The rapper, promoter and clothing designer is
undeterred by the slow sales of his latest release. He's got other
ventures to work on.</DH>

<AU>NEKESA MUMBI MOODY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It's hard to find an area that Master P hasn't tried to master.</LD>
<LD>   The 31-year-old hip-hop mogul, who at one time had a place on
Forbes magazine's list of top-earning entertainers, is perhaps
best-known for his rap label, No Limit Records.</LD>
<LD>   The label not only put Master P (born Percy Miller) and Southern
rap on the map, it also launched or helped resuscitate the careers of
Snoop Dogg, Mystikal, Silkk the Shocker, C-Murder and Lil' Romeo, his
12-year-old baby-faced son.</LD>
<TE>   But the New Orleans rapper has gotten just as much attention for
his other ventures, including film producer ("I Got the Hook Up"),
actor (the upcoming "Undisputed") and professional basketball player
(he was waived by the NBA's Toronto Raptors and Charlotte Hornets).</TE>
<TE>   His No Limit Sports firm represented then-rookie Ricky Williams
during negotiations with the NFL's New Orleans Saints in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, he's been trying to put the focus back on his music career
with the release of "Game Face." The disc sold a disappointing 72,000
copies when it was released last month.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, No Limit Records has lost some luster with the
departures of Snoop Dogg and Mystikal, and the recent arrest of
Master P's brother, C-Murder, on attempted murder charges.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Master P remains undeterred. He's launching a new clothing
line, called No Limit 100 Percent Genuine Urban Gear, and is working
with cable network Nickelodeon to develop a show for Lil' Romeo.</TE>
<TE>   Question: You were criticized when you negotiated Ricky Williams'
contract. Some said his contract, filled with incentives, was a
mistake because it garnered him less money. What's your opinion?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: I don't see why it didn't work out. I think it was
probably the best thing that happened to Ricky Williams and the best
thing that happened to the Saints.... People need to realize that
Ricky Williams wanted that incentive contract</TE>
<TE>   Q: How have your brother's legal woes affected you?</TE>
<TE>   A: Everyone has a black sheep in the family that's done something
wrong.... You don't judge [a] person by what someone else does. We're
definitely praying for him, hoping that this teaches him a lesson.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you ever worry about losing touch with your fans?</TE>
<TE>   A: I come from the ghetto; I don't worry about image, I worry
about making money.... I think people get it wrong, think that you
are not supposed to change.... There's nothing wrong with coming out
of the ghetto, but you also have to remember where you came from.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What are some of the things that you do to give back?</TE>
<TE>   A: I help them by making sure that I can do something for them,
like putting up computers in the community.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is there anything you miss about your pre-fame days?</TE>
<TE>   A: I wish I could just walk in the malls and go to the movies....
But when I could do all that, I was broke (laughs).</TE>

<LD>   Elton John a 'Hero,' AIDS Charity Says</LD>
<LD>   British pop legend Sir Elton John says he was lucky not to have
contracted HIV as a result of his lifestyle.</LD>
<TE>   Speaking at a charity event this week at which he was given a Hero
Award for AIDS-related fund-raising, the singer said it had taken the
death from AIDS in 1990 of an American hemophiliac, Ryan White, to
convince him to change his lifestyle. He was at the 18-year-old's
deathbed, he recalled, and sang at his funeral.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a time in my life when I really wasn't behaving myself
very well. If you look at the footage of me singing at his funeral, I
look like a 90-year-old man. Shortly afterward, because of what I
saw, and how ashamed I was of myself, and my selfish behavior, I
decided to get sober, especially being a gay man who was very lucky
not to get infected."</TE>
<TE>   Because he was given a second chance, he said, he vowed to do
something positive. Since then, he's become involved with the UK
Coalition of People Living With HIV and AIDS and formed his own AIDS
foundation, which has handed out more than $30 million.</TE>
<TE>   Furtado Not Amused by Magazine Cover Photo</TE>
<TE>   Nelly Furtado is miffed about a midriff. The Canadian singer has
complained that a photo of her on the cover of the British men's
magazine FHM was digitally altered to show a bare torso--and it's not
hers.</TE>
<TE>   "There I am with a shirt that has actually been digitally altered
to go to just below my chest, with a stomach that I don't recognize,
saying 'Nelly Furtado--her sexiest shoot yet,'" the singer told
British Broadcasting Corp. radio. "I don't like being misrepresented
to my fans. You work hard to represent a certain thing and have a
certain image, and somebody can take it all away with the cover of a
magazine."</TE>
<TE>   Magazine spokespeople had no immediate comment.</TE>

<TE>   'Blade Runner'--The Third Go-Round</TE>
<TE>   "Blade Runner" is being recut--again. But, unlike the 1992
10th-anniversary revision, it's not being called a "director's cut."</TE>
<TE>   Ridley Scott's main DVD producer, Charles de Lauzirika, told the
trade publication Video Premieres that most of the director's major
fixes--the removal of the narration, the happy ending and the
inclusion of the unicorn--were covered in the 1992 version. But
still, he says, Scott wasn't completely satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   In the third and "final little polish" for DVD, he says, there
will be more emphasis on the dream sequence with the unicorn--footage
that, contrary to rumor, was not shot for Scott's 1985 movie
"Legend."</TE>
<TE>   There is no deadline for completion of the project.</TE>
<TE>   'A.I.,' 'Potter' Among Effects Contenders</TE>
<TE>   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has announced
eight contenders for achievement in visual effects at this year's
Oscar ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   In alphabetical order, they are "A.I. Artificial Intelligence,"
"Black Hawk Down," "Cats and Dogs," "The Fast and the Furious,"
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," "Jurassic Park III," "The
Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" and "Pearl Harbor."</TE>
<TE>   The visual effects award nomination committee will screen
15-minute clip reels from each on Feb. 6 and narrow the field down to
three. The winner will be announced on March 24 at the 74th Academy
Awards, to be televised on ABC.</TE>
<TE>   Photos Celebrate Women in Film</TE>
<TE>   Thirty women, including performers Joan Allen and Susan Sarandon,
producer Jane Rosenthal, editor Dede Allen and screenwriter-directors
Jane Anderson and Allison Anders, will be featured in "Great Women of
Film: Photographs by Helena Lumme and Mika Manninen," an exhibition
to be presented at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences'
lobby gallery Feb. 8 through April 21 before going on tour.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the subjects are depicted in fantasy settings, while
others are playing roles such as a gypsy or a sheriff. "We wanted to
give the exhibition visitors interesting stories, as well as
showcasing the women," Manninen says.</TE>
<TE>   Videotaped interviews with the subjects will be published in book
form and turned into a documentary.</TE>

<TE>   'The Producers' Heading for San Diego</TE>
<TE>   The national touring production of the Broadway smash hit "The
Producers" will have its West Coast premiere at the San Diego Civic
Theatre, a Nederlander executive told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   The Mel Brooks musical, which revolves around greedy Broadway
producers seeking to mount a sure-fire hit, won a record 12 Tony
Awards last year. The two-week run in San Diego, from Dec. 31-Jan.
12, 2003, will not be the first stop on the national tour, although
officials would not confirm in which city the tour would launch.</TE>

<TE>   Belt-Tightening at Minnesota Public Radio</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota Public Radio, one of the largest public radio networks,
will cut jobs from its staff and trim back its current year's budget
because of the economic downturn--exacerbated by the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   According to MPR President Bill Kling, the network's budget will
grow by 6% in the 2002 fiscal year instead of 15% as originally
expected. As many as 13 people are being cut from a work force of
about 350.</TE>
<TE>   No ripples are expected at Pasadena-based KPCC-FM (89.3), which
MPR has a hand in managing. CEO Bill Davis met with his staff on
Wednesday and said that no layoffs or budget cuts are planned. The
station has already trimmed its budget, refrained from buying certain
equipment and reduced the staff through attrition, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Individual membership and donations were at record levels this
past fall," Davis said. "But we've got a number of grant applications
out, and our budgetary fate hangs in the balance. If the media
recession continues, we may have to rethink our plan. We'll be
prudent and manage month to month."</TE>

<HD>A Family  in Turmoil</HD>
<DH>Orson Welles was upset about the studio cut of 'Ambersons.'
Editor Robert Wise recalls  what it was like to be caught in the
middle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE THOMAS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The A&amp;E television adaptation of "The Magnificent Ambersons"
scheduled for Sunday has reawakened interest in the original 1942
Orson Welles film, long considered one of the most tragic victims of
studio interference in Hollywood history. Even the press kit for the
A&amp;E TV movie includes the famous Welles quote, "They destroyed
'Ambersons,' and it destroyed me."</LD>
<LD>   Despite its misfortunes, "The Magnificent Ambersons" has been a
deeply influential film. When Vincente Minnelli was preparing "Meet
Me in St. Louis," it was the Welles film he studied. Martin Scorsese
paid obvious tribute to it with his adaptation of "Age of Innocence."
Even Wes Anderson has acknowledged its influence on his current hit
film, "The Royal Tenenbaums."</LD>
<LD>   British film magazine Sight &amp; Sound conducted an international
critics' poll in the 1980s in which "Ambersons" was voted one of the
top 10 films of all time. And in his seminal book, "The Liveliest
Art," film historian Arthur Knight rates it over "Citizen Kane" as an
artistically more accomplished work. Welles himself always maintained
that, in its original form, it was his  greatest work.</LD>
<TE>   Robert Wise, who edited "Ambersons," remains sympathetic to
Welles' complaints about cuts in the film but insists that no effort
was made to destroy the picture. "I have always said that despite
what Orson said, since 'Ambersons' has come down through the years as
a classic in its own right, that means we didn't destroy it, doesn't
it?" Wise said.</TE>
<TE>   Orson Welles Called It</TE>
<TE>   a 'Mutilation,' but Was It?</TE>
<TE>   For decades, Welles' version of the supposed "mutilation" of
"Ambersons" has been accepted as gospel. Only in recent years has
there been a willingness to reexamine the events and dispel many of
the long-held assumptions regarding its troubled post-production.
With the publication of Robert Carringer's meticulously researched
"Magnificent Ambersons: A Reconstruction" in 1993, it became possible
to study precisely which scenes were cut, trimmed or re-shot.</TE>
<TE>   Carringer reveals that Welles, in Brazil filming the equally
ill-fated "It's All True," was a willing accessory in suggesting many
of those changes. And he says the man who was caught in the middle
between Welles and the studio was the film's editor,  Wise.</TE>
<TE>   Though now best known as the director of such landmark films as
"West Side Story," "The Day the Earth Stood Still" and "The Sound of
Music," Wise was just a 26-year-old on the RKO lot in 1941 when he
was summoned to meet  Welles.</TE>
<TE>   After recently viewing the new TV adaptation ("It makes you
appreciate our version that much more"), Wise reflected on the events
of 60 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I met Orson, he was already shooting 'Kane,'" Wise
said. "It was the scene where he was playing Kane as an old man, and
he had on all this old-age makeup. He wasn't happy with his original
editor, a rather old-fashioned fellow, and since we were the same
age, he thought I might work out."</TE>
<TE>   "Citizen Kane," of course, went on to secure a place in film
history and earned Wise his first Oscar nomination for editing. When
Welles began "Ambersons," he sought out Wise again.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking forward to working on 'Ambersons,' because I
remembered being so moved by the radio program. [Welles had presented
a radio version of the play in 1939 as part of his Mercury Theatre
series.] I was so moved by it, I was really excited when I learned
that it was going to be the follow-up to 'Kane.' I thought, this will
show those people who thought 'Kane' was cold; this will be Orson's
chance to prove that he has heart."</TE>
<TE>   Booth Tarkington's "The Magnificent Ambersons," which won the 1918
Pulitzer Prize, held special meaning for Welles. He maintained that
the character of Eugene Morgan was based on his father, who had been
an associate of Tarkington. He felt an affinity for the portrait of a
wealthy family's fall set against the backdrop of fin de siecle
America being overtaken by the ensuing Industrial Age, and he  played
the part of the spoiled protagonist, George Amberson Minafer, in the
radio production.</TE>
<TE>   But when it came time to shoot the film, he selected cowboy actor
Tim Holt for George. Welles also used some of his Mercury Theatre
stock company from "Kane"--Joseph Cotten as inventor Eugene Morgan,
Agnes Moorehead as the repressed Aunt Fanny and the jovial Ray
Collins as Uncle Jack--to fill out the cast, choosing then-unknown
Anne Baxter for the ingenue role of Lucy.</TE>
<TE>   Principal photography began on Oct. 28, 1941, and there was a
great deal riding on the film. "Citizen Kane" had gone over budget
and had not performed well at the box office. RKO chief George
Schaefer had signed Welles to a much-publicized contract guaranteeing
him unparalleled artistic freedom, but with the poor returns from
"Kane," Schaefer was under mounting pressure to have Welles deliver a
hit.</TE>
<TE>   But it was events in far-off lands that sealed the fate of
"Ambersons." As the crew assembled on a Monday morning in December to
shoot the scene in Eugene Morgan's auto factory, the world had been
irrevocably altered by the attack on Pearl Harbor the day before.
Overnight, the mood of the country was transformed. America was
mobilizing for war.</TE>
<TE>   As "Ambersons" drew to a finish in January, Welles began acting in
"Journey Into Fear" in the evenings. Additionally, he had been
persuaded by Nelson Rockefeller to aid the war effort by shooting a
film in South America and prepared to fly to Rio de Janeiro. Wise
assembled a rough cut of the film, which he took to Miami to discuss
with Welles. On Feb. 5, 1942, Wise spent the day recording Welles'
narration, and the next day Welles composed a telegram that gave Wise
the unquestioned authority to supervise all aspects of
post-production.</TE>
<TE>   The plan was to have Wise fly to Rio with alternate shots and
music cues, to give Welles the widest possible latitude in
determining the final cut. These plans were abandoned when the
government refused Wise permission to travel to Brazil. On March 16,
a screening for RKO executives did not go well.</TE>
<TE>   After it, Jack Moss, Welles' business manager, uttered a prophetic
line: "We've got a problem." The next day, a preview was held in
Pomona, and the reception was catastrophic.</TE>
<TE>   Wise recalled the preview. "At a certain point, the studio became
concerned because they had a lot of money tied up in the picture,
about a million dollars, which was a big budget in those days. So we
went out for some previews with our work print to Pomona, and the
preview was just terrible. The audience didn't like it, they walked
out, they were laughing at Aggie Moorehead's character, and it was an
absolute disaster."</TE>
<TE>   One of the most startling revelations of the Carringer book was
that, contrary to legend, Welles himself had ordered a massive cut in
the middle of the film before the disastrous Pomona preview.  Welles'
own gutting of the film resulted in a jarring and overly melodramatic
second act. Combined with the scenes of a hysterical  Moorehead and
the unsympathetic nature of the spoiled protagonist, it proved to be
too much for the wartime audience.</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   "We took it the next time to Pasadena, and it played a little
better but still not acceptable," Wise said.</TE>
<TE>   "We then cut some more and rearranged things, and the third time
we took it to Inglewood, but we had cut so much we had continuity
problems and needed some new scenes to bridge the gaps. We then took
it to Long Beach, and they sat for it, they didn't walk out, they
didn't laugh. And that's the way it went out."</TE>
<TE>   The Last-Minute</TE>
<TE>   Rewrite of the Ending</TE>
<TE>   The most controversial deletion was the final scene, set in a
boardinghouse. Although the original script had kept the same ending
as the novel and the radio program, Welles rewrote the scene at the
last minute and had it take  place   in a boardinghouse where Aunt
Fanny lives.</TE>
<TE>   Eugene comes to visit and recounts the same dialogue as in the
earlier (and later) versions, with the primary difference being that
Moorehead sits in a rocking chair in something of a catatonic state
as Eugene prattles on, oblivious to her distress. Welles claimed it
was the best scene in the film, but the reaction at the time suggests
that this long scene ended the film on a sour note.</TE>
<TE>   Carringer has stated that Welles never did find a satisfactory
conclusion for "Ambersons," not in the radio version, not in the
original draft and not in the boardinghouse scene.</TE>
<TE>   This scene was not quite the dramatic conclusion of the film that
Welles always claimed; that moment is reached when George is alone in
the deserted Amberson mansion, weeping for his dead mother's
forgiveness. It was there, as Welles' commentary so aptly informs,
that George Amberson Minafer got his comeuppance. Having reached this
dramatic climax, all that is left in the film is epilogue, whether
set in a study, a boardinghouse or a hospital corridor.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant director Freddie Fleck shot a different ending that
retains Cotten's dialogue from the earlier ending but sets it in a
hospital and implies that Eugene and Aunt Fanny will get together.
This was the version that Schaefer approved for release, but for him
it was too late.</TE>
<TE>   The Welles debacle had forced the tiny studio to borrow money to
cover costs and, in June 1942, Schaefer was fired. The new regime had
little patience for Welles or "Ambersons," and the film was
unceremoniously released a month later.</TE>
<TE>   Welles returned in August and began decrying the changes to the
film that occurred in his absence.  He had neglected to bring home
the complete 132-minute print, leaving it in Brazil, and it vanished.
Film preservationists  dream that it  survives. But until some
cinematic Indiana Jones uncovers Welles' print, the 88-minute version
is all we have.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always maintained that in its original version, 'Ambersons'
may have been a greater work of art, but we had to get the film so it
would hold people's attention," Wise said. "Remember, back then the
average picture was 90 minutes; if you had something that went over
an hour and a half you were in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Wise also rebuts the claim that the excised footage was destroyed
as a personal attack on Welles. "It was standard practice that, after
the previews, when you'd come back and take sequences out, you'd put
them in the vault. About six months after the films were released and
if you didn't need to change the film, they'd sell the footage for
the silver."</TE>
<TE>   Despite lack of support from the new regime at RKO, "The
Magnificent Ambersons" received four Oscar nominations, including
best picture and best supporting actress for Moorehead. It won none.</TE>
<TE>   "Orson was as close to a genius as anyone I've ever met," Wise
said. "But he was undisciplined. On 'Kane,' he was totally focused on
the film, but on 'Ambersons,' he was doing his radio program, he was
producing and acting in 'Journey Into Fear,' he was getting ready to
go to Rio; he just had too much else going on."</TE>
<TE>   To the end of his life, Welles bitterly spoke of the "mutilation"
of the film. He may also have underestimated the magnitude of his own
accomplishment. Despite the post-production traumas, "The Magnificent
Ambersons" remains an artistic achievement, a powerful examination of
love's tragic consequences set against a vanished Eden.</TE>

<HD>Scribes of Precision and Obsession</HD>
<DH>In labors of love, the 13 artists at Angles Gallery come up
with works that range from the minutely ordered to the meticulously
violent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEAH OLLMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High concept has its place in the terrifically engaging "furor
scribendi" show at Angles Gallery, but what dominates this selection
of works on paper is simply a tremendous amount of nitty-gritty
labor, some of it deliciously obsessive.</LD>
<LD>   There is no capitalizing on accidents here, and little in the way
of spontaneous gestures or random marks. All 13 artists--from
California, New York and Europe--favor precision, whether in the form
of carefully aligned, floating architectural planes (Kevin Appel),
chromatically intense stripes (Linda Besemer) or, most memorably,
meticulous scenes of quiet violence (Kelly McLane).</LD>
<LD>   McLane's five striking images can be read independently or
sequentially, the recurrence of key elements pressing the mind into
narrative service. Drawn in soft, silvery middle grays, they use
formal restraint to counter the extremity of the action depicted. On
each page, a semi-natural disaster of some kind is playing out, a
final reckoning between what the Earth has provided and what we've
forced upon it. An avalanche of tires buries a car in one drawing; in
another, a raging fire consumes the tires; and in another, tires and
mobile homes are cast adrift in a tempestuous sea. Animals witness
the destruction: A pair of deer watch mutely in one scene, a few
rabbits peek out from inside tires in another. Curious and wonderful,
McLane's drawings whisper of doom.</LD>
<TE>   Lisa Yuskavage and Aaron Romine focus on immediate pleasures of
the flesh in their contributions; Simone Adels and Kathy Prendergast
map space through repetitive abstract marks. Ewan Gibbs and M.E.
Carroll render architectural plans or facades through minute, orderly
notations--grids of tiny circles in Gibbs' case and, in Carroll's,
continuous lines of tiny, tiny text from "Alice in Wonderland" and
the Greek drama "Lysistrata."</TE>
<TE>   David Bunn applies a rigorous system, also to lyrical, poetic
ends. His darkly humorous, multipart work weaves together notations
on a medical anomaly, references to Freudian theory and classic
catchphrases from horror literature. Bunn's brilliance lies in his
manipulation of found material--junked library card catalogs--to spin
complex commentary on the currency and obsolescence of objects and
ideas alike.</TE>
<TE>   Tom LaDuke set for himself the banal goal of using all of the ink
in a four-color ballpoint pen, and the product of his conceptual
exercise is the charming "Blossom," in which a single delicate,
shimmering firework of a flower hovers within a densely inked page.
Rebecca Bollinger draws sheets of diminutive images culled from
Internet keyword searches. Amusing and strangely intimate, her
drawings function as visual indices to everything from personal
memory to furniture styles.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Roberts' two interior dollhouse views prompt a double take
that reveals them to be less illustrations of toys than tenderly
considered studies in social anthropology.</TE>
<TE>   Although many of the efforts here are diminutive in scale, all of
the drawings have assured presence. Furor, or "inspired frenzy," is
indeed the name of the game with these marvelously consuming
commitments to paper.</TE>

<TE>   Narratives of Loss: Either William Eggleston has been stepping up
the pathos in his legendarily dispassionate work or the art world's
traditional conventions of beauty have expanded so that his work no
longer seems so aggressively cold and ugly.</TE>
<TE>   Both, it seems, have occurred since the '70s, when the Museum of
Modern Art presumptuously canonized Eggleston as the first color
photographer of any importance. It wasn't just his use of color that
challenged the existing canon but his fixation on the nondescript,
the common and the banal.</TE>
<TE>   The success of his work has given legions of artists permission to
tread in his wake, shunning the picturesque in favor of the
overlooked. In abundant company now, he no longer occupies a position
on the aesthetic fringe; the center has come to him.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, as his recent photographs at Rose Gallery
illustrate, Eggleston's vision has gradually softened. These Iris
prints have none of the brashness and harsh intensity of his dye
transfers, and the imagery feels more tender, more keyed to abandoned
souls than simply overlooked places.</TE>
<TE>   In one image, a plush gold upholstered chair turns its back to us,
while a small suitcase beside it opens to reveal lavender satin
pockets sagging like aged breasts, a sweater and some rusted cans and
sand from the scrappy ground it sits on.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the pictures here--all were shot during the last few years
in California and Arizona--suggest a similar narrative of loss.</TE>
<TE>   Eggleston, like his closest predecessor, Walker Evans, relishes
the discarded and obsolete. Signs fascinated them both--for what they
said, for how they looked and for the canny way the words and image,
context and texture fused into something poignant, poetic: the irony
of the convenience store sign in the semi-wilderness; an arrow
advertising something yet pointing to nothing but the desert's
endless scrub; the punning shop sign that announces and suggests
"Open/Gifts."</TE>
<TE>   Eggleston says he tries to photograph democratically, but there is
really no such thing as a democratic eye. Choice is all in
photography, and hierarchies assert themselves in every frame.</TE>
<TE>   What Eggleston's pictures illuminate for us is that, in
photography, meaning adheres to all things democratically, that
framing engenders significance and not the other way around.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Gallery, Bergamot Station, 2525 Michigan Ave., Santa Monica,
(310) 264-8440, through Jan. 19. Closed Sundays and Mondays.</TE>
<TE>   A Matter of Interpretation: There's no easy way to look at Marlene
McCarty's large portrait drawings at Sandroni Rey, no simple way of
categorizing them as good or bad. Vexed by contradictions, they feel
at once tender and exploitative. They seem to sympathize with their
subjects while at the same time sensationalizing them.</TE>
<TE>   McCarty's "Young Americans" are teenage girls, drawn in pencil and
ballpoint pen in a casual, illustrative style. One sits in profile,
with slightly hunched back, her head turned toward us. Another sits
on the ground, her arms dangling between raised knees. With one
exception, they are pretty young women with clear, open faces framed
by lush, shampoo-ad hair. Their scale just slightly exceeds our own,
so their space and ours feel fairly continuous. What, then, to make
of our easy identification with these girls, who happen to be
convicted murderers?</TE>
<TE>   One, according to texts hung separately from the drawings, beat
her mother to death with a crystal candlestick after the mother
disapproved of her boyfriend. Another killed her parents and brother
so that she could collect an inheritance and settle in with her
older, married lover. Nowhere in the girls' calm expressions does
McCarty hint of their capacity for such brutality, but she does
expose them in another way, which suggests something about the
impetus for their crimes. She draws their clothes as transparent,
allowing unencumbered views of their budding breasts and vulvas. The
girls appear as overtly sexualized beings, victims, perhaps, of their
bodies and beauty or, alternately, in fierce command of them,
prepared to defend to the death their sexual freedom.</TE>
<TE>   McCarty has toyed with tough material before. In the early '90s,
she made word paintings, filling canvases with in-your-face sexual
slang. Those works, like the drawings here, trade on easy gestures
and their uneasy responses. McCarty forces us to assume a prurient
view of these young women, announces their horrific deeds and yet
still manages to convey something of their innocence.</TE>
<TE>   There is no easy way to regard these portraits, and--more to
McCarty's point--no single way to characterize the young women they
represent.</TE>
<TE>   Sandroni Rey, 1224 Abbot Kinney, Venice, (310) 392-3404, through
Jan. 19. Closed Sundays through Tuesdays.</TE>
<TE>   In Search of Subversion: You may have seen Jason Middlebrook's
installation at the Santa Monica Museum of Art and not known it--a
sign that it's either extremely coy or inconsequential.</TE>
<TE>   Subversive, but not nearly enough, the installation is in the
Project Room near the museum entrance, a space that's raw to begin
with and that Middlebrook has made to look neglected as well. A
ladder leans against the exposed concrete-block wall, near a paint
bucket filled with trash. Wood scraps clutter the floor beneath a
window that's been boarded shut. In the center of the room, a pallet
of plywood sheets receives the steady drip of an overhead leak.</TE>
<TE>   Calling his installation "Museum Storage," Middlebrook conjures
not just the image of the institution's backroom but the concept of
its history, its past. He includes old blueprints of a never-realized
modification of the museum among the clutter here, along with a lot
of dusty old notices indicating the museum's closure on a holiday or
warning visitors of controversial content within.</TE>
<TE>   Middlebrook, who is based in New York, gets a bit more theatrical
with an old donations box, which he's turned into a scruffy
terrarium, and with the cracked concrete floor, which he's planted
with a few plastic weeds.</TE>
<TE>   Wrapped objects on the storage racks sprout green stuff too, as if
left there inordinately long. One large painting, however, is fresh
and visible, presenting an image of a dilapidated shed with a facade
just like the Santa Monica Museum's. It's rendered as a facility in
decline but also, with debris flying around it, like the epicenter of
a geologic convulsion.</TE>
<TE>   Using a museum's public space to expose its private workings is
certainly not a new strategy but one with great potential for
provocation. Chris Burden's subterranean excavation at the Geffen
Contemporary in the late '80s allowed glimpses of the institution's
physical underbelly. More recently, Michael Asher enacted a radical
exposure of another sort for a show at the Museum of Modern Art,
printing a free-for-the-asking brochure listing works by major
artists that the museum had deaccessioned over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Middlebrook's installation extends the cynical notion of the
museum as a place where things go to die, but the gesture is neither
incisive nor terribly clever. As one visiting child commented upon
entering the room, voicing, no doubt, many an adult visitor's
impatient befuddlement, "Is something going to happen here?"</TE>

<HD>In 'Princesa,' an Unusual Dream Treated Tactfully</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a train approaches Milan, an immigration official on board takes
note of a striking young passenger and detains her in his station
office. He perceives in her something that will elude many watching
Henrique Goldman's poignant "Princesa": that she is a transsexual.</LD>
<LD>   This 19-year-old Brazilian beauty understands without discussion
that she will have to grant him sexual favors. The poised and proud
Fernanda (Ingrid de Souza) takes this exploitation in stride, for she
has come all the way from a town in the Amazon to earn enough money
to pay for a sex-change operation that will make her a "normal"
woman.</LD>
<LD>   She then will be able to fulfill a dream that has sustained her
since childhood: to find a husband and become a housewife. Fernanda
has followed an older friend, Charlo (Biba Lerhue), a transvestite
who is part of a group of Brazilian sex workers who have discovered
they can make far more money in Italy than at home. Through the
cynical Charlo, Fernanda, who calls herself "Princesa" after a role
she craved to play in a grade-school production, meets Karin (Lulu
Pecorari), a successful, middle-aged transsexual madam who is lonely
and so taken with the immediately popular newcomer that she invites
her to live in her elegant apartment.</LD>
<TE>   Princesa encounters a john who does not clock her as the pre-op
transsexual she is and shrinks in horror at his discovery. Yet Gianni
(Cesare Bocci), a 40-ish attorney, is so dazzled that he returns full
of apologies, sparking a romance.</TE>
<TE>   With "happily ever after" in reach, Princesa begins a journey of
self-discovery that begins at a gender reassignment clinic where she
learns the range of gender permutations. She realizes that after her
gender decision, there will still be the need for self-acceptance.</TE>
<TE>   Fernanda's life unfolds with discretion, compassion and humor
under the sensitive yet lively direction of Goldman, who collaborated
with Ellis Freeman on the script, a fictional tale inspired by the
real-life Fernanda, to whom the film is dedicated.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of Bocci, a professional actor, and Mauro
Pirovano, who plays a kindly but garrulous john, key roles are played
by transsexuals. Goldman achieves a smooth ensemble effect.</TE>
<TE>   The well-made "Princesa" is daring, for it ends on an upbeat note
in circumstances that are traditionally treated otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Unrated. Times guidelines: Adult themes and situations, strong
language, discreet treatment of sex.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Magnificent Ambersons," like the rich and influential Indiana
family it chronicles from the 1880s to the early 20th century, is
magnificent irregularly. A&amp;E's great-looking but often overcooked new
rendition of Booth Tarkington's 1918 novel is noteworthy partly
because of the mythic nature of its predecessor, the "Magnificent
Ambersons" movie that Orson Welles chose to make after his
boy-wonderdom epic, "Citizen Kane."</LD>
<LD>   Although it has champions, mainly cinephiles drawn to its
innovative photography and sound, Welles' "Ambersons" is a pretty
horrid film, much less a marvel than a mishmash, its young
protagonist's implied Oedipus complex and other crucial plot elements
having been exorcised in the editing room. Without first reading the
novel, following its disjointed narrative--capped by a grafted-on
ending that's almost giddy--becomes nearly impossible.</LD>
<LD>   Whether the director or the studio, RKO, is to blame for this
debacle is an ongoing debate that others will have to address, along
with the mystery surrounding the 44 minutes of footage carved from
the Welles original to sweat it down to the undernourished 88 minutes
that was delivered to movie houses 60 years ago. That re-cut version
remains available today on video.</LD>
<TE>   Shot in Ireland, with turn-of-the-century Indianapolis being
replicated in northern Dublin, this new "Ambersons" comes in at 139
minutes (without commercials), its $16-million budget stunningly
visible right away in an opening gala in the Amberson mansion where
the town's silk hats and white-gloved ladies have gathered in 1904
for a Christmas ball to honor snotty young George Amberson (Jonathan
Rhys Meyers), who is home on break from college.</TE>
<TE>   This beautifully filmed waltz of Ambersonian elegance glides gaily
in its own cloistered universe of privilege and decadence. So it
makes sense that George's mother, Isabel Amberson Minafer (Madeleine
Stowe), and self-made automobile mogul Eugene Morgan (Bruce
Greenwood) would be followed by servants with umbrellas to protect
them from gently falling snow as they dance just outside the ballroom
in a lingering moment of tender affection.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it's a tragic ballet of sorts, given the unhappiness
ahead for them thanks to George, whose destructive obsession with his
widowed mother will ultimately sever her from Eugene and abort their
romance. All the while, he continues to aggressively pursue Eugene's
daughter, Lucy (Gretchen Mol).</TE>
<TE>   In most ways, this "Ambersons" is not only faithful to the novel,
which earned Tarkington the first of two Pulitzer Prizes, but also
soars above the 1942 film that had Tim Holt as George, Dolores
Costello as Isabel, Joseph Cotten as Eugene and Anne Baxter as Lucy.</TE>
<TE>   Working from Welles' original shooting script, director Alfonso
Arau ("Like Water for Chocolate") at least delivers a story that one
can follow, as George lives his young life selfishly and cruelly, and
the Ambersons ultimately topple from Midwestern aristocracy all the
way to the working class when eclipsed by the changing world around
them.</TE>
<TE>   If staging were all that mattered, this grandly mounted effort
would be an unqualified success, even though a couple of early
outdoor scenes are marred by cheesy rear and side projection shots
that belie the movie's ample budget.</TE>
<TE>   Arau does, at key times, achieve the perfect pitch, as with the
scene when George stuns Eugene by denying him entry to the Amberson
mansion, where Isabel is waiting for him. After the door is slammed
in his face, a stunned and puzzled Eugene is visible through the
frosted glass, pausing briefly before moving off. Moments later, Arau
shoots George moving ominously past a doorway like a dark shadow,
cigarette between his lips, eyes left on his mother in the next room
where she awaits Eugene, unaware he's been turned away.</TE>
<TE>   Arau gets especially nice performances here from Stowe, Greenwood,
William Hootkins as Georgie's genial Uncle George and James Cromwell
as his grandfather, family patriarch Major Amberson.</TE>
<TE>   Too frequently, though, Arau chooses wild extravagance over
nuance, with Meyers, in the story's pivotal role, being allowed to
burn his way through "Ambersons" like a laser.</TE>
<TE>   If Holt's George was more sympathetic and benign than the adult
brat Tarkington created, Meyers' is too twitchy, volcanic and
flipped-out. More than just nasty, spoiled, pompous and tightly
wound, he appears psychotic, if not flat-out deranged in his black
suits, with Arau repeatedly going to his crazed eyes through those
steel-rimmed spectacles that add to his severity.</TE>
<TE>   There's too much surface in him, too little held back. George's
groans in the novel become shouts in this movie, the "passion in his
face" more like the out-of-control frothing one finds in a madman,
making his future self-blame and partial mea culpa all the more
unbelievable.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Irishman Meyers wears some of Tarkington's lines like
a truss, specifically when spitting out "See here" or "Look here" to
begin a sentence.</TE>
<TE>   At least he looks the part. The movie's most exotic casting has
Jennifer Tilly as Georgie's "spinster" Aunt Fanny, a whimpering
eccentric who was played frantically by Agnes Moorehead in the Welles
movie. Some of their scenes together are memorably hysterical and
frenzied, notably one in which she angrily pelts him with dishes and
they wrestle on a table, after which he gets her in a headlock.</TE>
<TE>   "The Magnificent Ambersons" has its good moments, but this absurd
one is a TV first: two of the Three Stooges meeting Booth Tarkington.</TE>
<TE>   "The Magnificent Ambersons" airs Sunday at 8 p.m. on A&amp;E. The
network has rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young viewers).</TE>
<TE>   Howard Rosenberg's column appears Mondays and Fridays. He can be

<HD>Another LBJ Presides in Texas (Radio, That Is)</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KELLEY SHANNON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>AUSTIN, Texas</DL>
<LD>Like her mother before her, Luci Baines Johnson presides over a Texas
radio empire--with the emphasis on Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Home-state musicians Lyle Lovett, Robert Earl Keen and Willie
Nelson get plenty of air time. So do up-and-comers from Austin's
music scene. At the flagship KLBJ-AM, local news is a mainstay.
Throughout LBJS Broadcasting Co., employees promote community
service.</LD>
<LD>   "In a day and time where communications, especially radio, has an
increasing march toward homogenization, we have resisted that march,"
said Johnson, daughter of Lady Bird Johnson and the late President
Lyndon B. Johnson. "We believe that the edge for radio as an entity
is being local."</LD>
<TE>   Market figures appear to back her up. Combined, LBJS
Broadcasting's six stations are the local leader in the 25-to-54 age
group in audience share and total listeners, according to Arbitron
ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Being in the market for nearly 60 years has helped, said Johnson,
54, who, as chairwoman of her family's privately held LBJ Holding
Co., oversees its radio business.</TE>
<TE>   Ian Turpin, Johnson's husband, is president of LBJ Holding Co.,
which also includes real estate ventures. The couple returned to
Texas from Canada in the early 1990s to work more directly with the
company after an economic downturn took a toll on the Johnson family
operation.</TE>
<TE>   Luci's sister, Lynda Johnson Robb, is married to Chuck Robb, a
former Virginia governor and senator, and has less involvement in the
Texas business.</TE>
<TE>   Lady Bird Johnson, 89, remains on the holding company's board and
attends most of its meetings. She started the business when she
bought the family's first radio station in 1942 with $17,500 in
inheritance money while her husband was in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Then known as KTBC, the station had frequency problems, sales
problems and personnel problems. Lady Bird Johnson's close attention
gradually improved the station's bottom line. She sold commercial
time and even helped clean floors.</TE>
<TE>   Later she obtained one of the first FM signals at a time when the
potential of FM radio was unknown. The family acquired a television
station, KTBC, but sold it and its call letters in 1973. That's when
the designation KLBJ for the flagship radio station came about.</TE>
<TE>   LBJS Broadcasting has found a way to compete effectively against
larger companies, said Tom Taylor, editor of M Street Daily, a radio
industry newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   A large corporation with hundreds of stations may benefit from
cost savings and efficiencies. But the smaller, private LBJS
Broadcasting doesn't have to meet outside analysts' profit
projections and can concentrate on serving a niche in a local market,
Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the former first lady has "passed the baton" as leader of
the family's broadcasting business, Luci Johnson said she is working
to live up to her mother's standards.</TE>
<TE>   "It is what I try to do," she said. "I had a great teacher, a
remarkable mentor."</TE>

<HD>Opening a Door for Latin American Art</HD>
<DH>Museum* Real estate magnate Eduardo Costantini has not been
deterred from his mission to put the area back on the art world map.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY SMITH</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>Never mind the economic crisis, the champagne corks are popping at
the opening of the first temporary exhibition at Buenos Aires' new
Museum of Latin American Art.</LD>
<LD>   Spending $25 million to build a museum to showcase a collection
worth double that could be seen as politically incorrect, as
Argentina's economy writhes in its fourth year of agonizing
recession.</LD>
<LD>   But Eduardo Costantini was not to be deterred from his
self-appointed mission: putting Latin America back on the art world's
map.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to restore value to our own idiosyncrasies and culture,"
said Costantini, a soft-spoken, 55-year-old real estate magnate. "The
presence of Latin American art was lost internationally and even here
during our dark decades."</TE>
<TE>   The "dark decades"--of brutal military dictatorships in the 1960s
and 1970s, followed by the continent's "lost decade" of
hyperinflation and economic quick fixes in the 1980s--left Latin
American art on the periphery of world trends.</TE>
<TE>   Even at home, artists were often driven underground by harsh,
authoritarian regimes that did not tolerate dissidence.</TE>
<TE>   So it is apt that the first temporary exhibition at the Malba, as
Costantini's museum is known here, was "The Politics of Difference,"
a celebration of the diversities of all the countries of the
Americas.</TE>
<TE>   "For years, Latin America considered the 'foreign model'--even in
art--to be superior to our indigenous version," Costantini said.
"This shows that's not true."</TE>
<TE>   In the museum, works by 110 artists from 26 countries--from the
Dutch Antilles to Venezuela--demonstrate that the democracy that took
root across most of Latin America in the 1990s has given artists
unbridled creativity.</TE>
<TE>   Sculptures, installations and traditional paintings deal with
themes of diversity in race, culture, creed, sexuality and politics.</TE>
<TE>   On the second floor, sandwiched between two floors of the
temporary show, is Costantini's permanent collection. It has grown
from "one or two works that weren't of museum quality" in the 1980s
to 220 today.</TE>
<TE>   The works include "Manifestacion," a classic, naive portrait of
disgruntled workers painted in 1934 by Argentina's Antonio Berni;
"The Widows" by Colombia's Fernando Botero; and Frida Kahlo's 1942
self-portrait "Auto Retrato con Chango y Loro."</TE>
<TE>   The Kahlo, acquired in 1996, cost Costantini $3.2 million, a
record price for any piece of Latin American art.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many art buyers, Costantini doesn't shun publicity, even
when record prices are being paid. His purchases in New York City,
Mexico City or Sao Paulo are often made with a very public flourish
and accompanied across Latin America by newspaper headlines.</TE>
<TE>   He says it is part of a strategy to market the museum--a marble,
steel and glass structure, armed with "intelligent technology" to
control temperatures and humidity. Built without assistance from the
Argentine authorities, it was inaugurated Sept. 20.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good advertising for the collection and for the museum,"
Costantini said.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe you have to show your face at auctions. This is a very
public collection."</TE>
<TE>   "The museum is important for art all over Latin America," said
Cristina R. Duran, a critic for the arts section of Brazilian
business daily Valor. "It will give added value to Latin American
art."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the important Brazilian works in the collection were
previously owned by private Brazilian collectors who never showed
them to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "Costantini is not like that," she said. "He opens art up. He
wants everyone to see it."</TE>
<TE>   The museum--like the collection--transcends national boundaries.
Its curator is Agustin Arteaga, who formerly directed Mexico City's
Museum of Fine Arts.</TE>
<TE>   "The great thing to see here is that we are attracting youngsters
you wouldn't normally see in a museum in Buenos Aires," said Arteaga.
"They are our customers of the future."</TE>
<TE>   He stresses that the museum has an important social role to play:
It gives guided tours to needy children, and counts many young
artists among its 85 staff.</TE>
<TE>   "It's better for them to learn to be an art handler here than
ending up as a taxi driver," Arteaga said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Argentina's economic woes, the museum has attracted 90,000
visitors in its first three months. Nobody has complained about the
$4 entry fee, although all state-run museums are free.</TE>
<TE>   "People see they are paying something, but supporting something,"
Arteaga said.</TE>

<HD>'Kandahar' Proves Moving and Timely</HD>
<DH>The film tells a personal and socially conscious tale of
life for women under Taliban rule in Afghanistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mohsen Makhmalbaf's "Kandahar," a powerful depiction of oppression
and hardship under Taliban rule, would have been an important picture
even if the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks never occurred. It is but the
latest prize-laden, critically acclaimed work of one of Iran's major
directors, who combines here the intense social consciousness of his
earlier work with the poetic sensibility of his more recent films.</LD>
<LD>   In this post-Sept. 11 world, "Kandahar," its very title only newly
familiar, understandably drew far wider audiences in New York than
usual for an Iranian film. It was helped also by the fact that it is
largely and credibly in English.</LD>
<LD>   Then, just before Christmas, the film received unusual
publicity--or notoriety, anyway--when stories broke detailing the
strong possibility that one of the film's leading players, Hassan
Tantai, an African American, may be a former Howard University
student who fled to Iran in 1980 after fatally shooting a leading
Iranian dissident in Bethesda, Md.</LD>
<TE>   With the utmost simplicity, Makhmalbaf tells the story of a
beautiful Afghan-born journalist, Nafas (Nelofer Pazira), who fled to
Canada with her family nine years earlier at the advent of Taliban
rule, leaving a sister behind. The year is 1999, and Nafas has
received word that her sister is so despondent over having been
maimed by a land mine, added to her plight as a woman under Taliban
rule, that she declares she will commit suicide during an approaching
solar eclipse, an apt metaphor for the darkness enveloping
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Nafas makes her way to Iran's border with Afghanistan and, donning
a burka, is determined to enter her native country and make her way
to Kandahar to try to stop her sister from killing herself.</TE>
<TE>   She has but two days to make a difficult, dangerous journey
through desert terrain. Ever the journalist, she tape-records her
impressions at every turn.</TE>
<TE>   At the outset she manages to persuade an Afghan returning to his
homeland with his large family to pass her off as one of his four
wives. He agrees to the proposal, but not without a burst of the
hearty humor that from time to time relieves the bleakness and misery
the film depicts. A boy named Khak (Sadou Teymouri), expelled from a
school that intersperses chants on the operation of a semiautomatic
weapon with traditional Islamic prayers, escorts her on foot for some
distance.</TE>
<TE>   Then Hassan Tantai's Tabib Sahid, a self-proclaimed physician to
the needy, agrees to take her in his horse-drawn cart for most of the
remainder of the journey but chooses not to explain why he can't take
her all the way into the city.</TE>
<TE>   Nafas' journey allows Makhmalbaf to observe the suffering and
desperate poverty visited upon the Afghan people under Taliban rule.
In the film's most stirring sequence, Afghan men beg for prosthetic
legs and arms handed out at a Red Cross encampment to those who have
been maimed by land mines; the prosthetics are at so great a premium
that the waiting list is a year. The vast open spaces also allow
Makhmalbaf and his outstanding cinematographer, Ebraham Ghafouri, to
create a steady flow of stunning images, accompanied by Mohamad Reza
Darvishi's intoxicating yet spare score.</TE>
<TE>   "Kandahar" is a film of passion and immediacy, yet one that's
marked by the rigorous detachment typical of the director. As before,
Makhmalbaf is skilled at eliciting natural, unself-conscious
portrayals from nonprofessional actors. Pazira actually is an
Afghan-born Canadian journalist. This remarkably revealing and timely
film, in which the depiction of pain and sorrow is suffused with a
sense of beauty and a graceful, flowing style, more than lives up to
glowing advance notices.</TE>
<TE>   Unrated. Times guidelines: intense subject matter; harsh,
unsettling images.</TE>

<HD>A Pack of Cinematic Styles</HD>
<DH>'Brotherhood of the Wolf' combines elements of French,
Asian and U.S. filmmaking. But don't take things too seriously.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES FILM CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Brotherhood of the Wolf" is the cinematic equivalent of fusion
cuisine. It's not only that this French-language film has an editor
and a stunt coordinator from Hong Kong, a cinematographer from
Denmark and a star from Hawaii, it's that its very sensibility is an
unapologetic melange, mixing elements of French, Asian and American
cinema in ways that amuse and lead to indigestion.</LD>
<LD>   One of the five most popular films of the year in France, "Wolf"
is a cross-cultural hoot that no one should take too seriously. It's
a film set in an imaginary 18th century, in which some people write
with quill pens and others kick like Jackie Chan. Throw in scenes in
a decadent bordello and a Native American shaman who talks to trees
and does some healing in his spare time and you have something that
collectors of curiosities are sure to appreciate.</LD>
<LD>   The word in the French film community was that director Christophe
Gans (working with screenwriter Stephane Cabel) was trying to create
a French version of a Hollywood action blockbuster, complete with
sweeping camera work and jazzy editing. But being French, "Wolf" is
on the talky side as well, with lots of faux-philosophical
discussions by aristocrats with effete accents. "The Fast and the
Furious" this is not.</LD>
<TE>   Set in 1765, "Wolf" is based loosely on a historical incident, a
series of more than 100 brutal attacks by an unknown animal called
the Beast of Gevaudan that understandably terrorized that region in
the South of France.</TE>
<TE>   "Wolf" begins with said beast (as yet unseen) tracking an
unsuspecting woman and tossing her into the air like last week's
confetti. Described by the rare attack survivors as having teeth like
knives and weighing more than 500 pounds, the beast is given to
making fierce noises and has no visible fear of firearms.</TE>
<TE>   These exploits have come to the attention of King Louis XV, who
has dispatched naturalist-philosopher Gregoire de Fronsac (Samuel Le
Bihan) to study the offender once it is captured. A veteran of the
war against the British in "New France," a.k.a. the future U.S. of
A., Gregoire has returned with more than the usual souvenirs.</TE>
<TE>   Shadowing his every move is a Iroquois companion named Mani
(Hawaii-born martial arts champion Mark Dacascos). "He' s not my
valet," he says briskly by way of introduction, "he's my brother."</TE>
<TE>   Gregoire and Mani's entrance into "Wolf" during a driving
rainstorm is the film's best sequence. Wearing three-corner hats and
raincoats buttoned up to just beneath their piercing eyes, the two
men ride slowly into a band of ruffians and dispatch the lot with
some savvy martial arts moves.</TE>
<TE>   If those ruffians are surprised to come across fighting techniques
choreographed by Hong Kong veteran Philip Kwok (who did the fight
scenes for John Woo's "Hard-Boiled") in 18th century France, they do
not let on. In fact, strangely costumed men--and women--with martial
arts prowess are apparently to be found all over this region of
France. Who knew?</TE>
<TE>   Finding out the truth about the beast (which, predictably, is more
terrifying unseen than seen) turns out to be no simple matter, and
involves Gregoire with people like one-armed aristocrat and world
traveler Jean-Francois (Vincent Cassel) and mysterious Italian
demimondaine Sylvia (Monica Bellucci).</TE>
<TE>   Our hero even finds time to romance local beauty Marianne, played
by Emilie Dequenne, worlds away from the gritty title role in
"Rosetta" that won her the best actress prize at Cannes.</TE>
<TE>   The guilty pleasure of "Wolf" is the character of Mani, a whiz
with both feet who is not half bad with a tomahawk either.</TE>
<TE>   A New Age combination of Zen monk and Tonto, Mani comes with his
own supply of magic mushrooms and has a mystic brotherhood with
wolves that comes in awfully handy.</TE>
<TE>   "He could almost be the star of a video game," his director said
with enthusiasm. And so he could.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

sexuality/nudity. Times guidelines: nudity, sexuality, strange
violence.</TE>

<HD>NPR Weekend Anchor Plans to Exit</HD>
<DH>Radio* Seeking more free time and more varied projects, the
journalist asks to leave her post, but she'll continue reporting.</DH>

<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Lisa Simeone plans to leave her job as anchor of "Weekend All Things
Considered," saying her duties for the National Public Radio program
robbed her of too much free time and the chance to do other projects.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview, Simeone said she looked forward to reclaiming her
weekends and escaping the shackles of a full-time job. Instead, she
said, she intends to execute freelance stories on Baltimore for NPR
and other outlets.</LD>
<LD>   "I miss the freedom of my former life," Simeone said. "I have
other fish to fry. It's my mission to bring all of Baltimore's
wonderful wackiness to a national audience."</LD>
<TE>   Simeone is a longtime Baltimore resident who previously had been
the host of classical music shows on NPR and a public affairs show on
WJHU-FM (88.1), which still carries "Weekend All Things Considered."
She joined NPR permanently in October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, I'll be able to do all of the things normal people get to do
on weekends," Simeone said. "I want to go out to dinner, go to the
opera." Later, she added: "I'm a free spirit, let's face it."</TE>
<TE>   The split, effective in March, appears amicable. Both Simeone and
NPR managing editor Barbara Rehm said she would continue to file
stories for the radio network after she leaves her position.</TE>
<TE>   "She has been wonderful, magnificent," Rehm said. "She lights up
the air."</TE>
<TE>   Rehm attributed Simeone's decision to the constraints of being an
anchor. "I think she didn't like the confines of being a show host as
much as she did going in," Rehm said. "She's always been this
whirlwind of an operation. From the moment she had an idea to a piece
going on the air, she was involved in every aspect of the
production."</TE>
<TE>   On a program like Simeone's, anchors tend to rely more heavily on
a team of colleagues to produce the show.</TE>
<TE>   As well as her freelance work, Simeone said she is the anchor for
a pilot television program about military affairs that will be
offered to public television stations.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere at National Public Radio, Tavis Smiley launched a new
weekday morning program in style this week.</TE>
<TE>   Smiley's debut show Monday featured a lengthy interview with
Cornel West, the distinguished Harvard University professor who is in
a public tangle with the university's new president.</TE>
<TE>   After Harvard President Lawrence Summers' pointed inquiries about
West's political activities, West and several of his colleagues
issued a statement saying they would consider leaving the Cambridge,
Mass., campus.</TE>
<TE>   Smiley was the first to interview West, and his remarks were
excerpted on NPR's main newscasts and quoted widely elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not just a story that interested Cornel's fans--the
legions of them--in the African American community," Smiley said.
"This was reported on the front pages of many of the nation's most
notable newspapers. It was an exclusive that bridged both worlds."</TE>
<TE>   The program airs in the Baltimore area on WEAA-FM, the public
radio station of Morgan State University. The station's general
manager, Maxie C. Jackson III, was a key mover in the drive to create
the show by a consortium of public radio stations that primarily
serve black listeners. The program does not yet have an outlet in the
Southern California area.</TE>
<TE>   "What Tavis brings to the table is a national African American
perspective," Jackson said. "He alone has the contacts and the
persona to bring all these voices to the table." WEAA-FM draws one of
the largest audiences of any black-oriented public radio station in
the country, and its preeminence in jazz led it to be crowned as the
nation's top jazz station in 1999 by a trade publication. But Jackson
said he wants to do more, particularly in the morning hours, to
appeal to potential listeners.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of a spotlight on the African American intelligentsia,"
he said. Along with interviews of newsmakers, entertainers and
business executives, the show will broadcast commentaries by leading
academics such as West, Michael Eric Dyson of DePaul University,
Harvard Law School's Charles Ogletree, former Spelman College
President Johnetta Cole and Kimberly Crenshaw of UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Last March, Smiley was fired from his job as a host of a public
affairs show at cable television channel BET after airing an
exclusive interview on ABC. The move raised such an outcry that BET
founder Robert Johnson appeared on the air live to defend the
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Smiley will continue his own work for CNN and ABC News, as well as
his regular commentaries on Tom Joyner's program for ABC radio. But
Smiley says his show is important for NPR.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the opportunity to do for NPR what Arsenio Hall did in
late-night television," Smiley said. "He brought his blackness with
him every night. We are showcasing the kinds of voices that you do
not hear routinely on NPR."</TE>

<HD>Sept. 11 Effect Figures Into Radio Ratings</HD>
<DH>KROQ-FM was No. 1 overall, but Arbitron shows listeners
tuned to talk, news and comforting oldies after attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Terrorism, Osama bin Laden, anthrax and war in Afghanistan were
clearly on Southland radio listeners' minds after Sept. 11, and many
wanted to talk about it.</LD>
<LD>   The just-released quarterly Arbitron ratings figures, covering
Sept. 20 through Dec. 12, show that a lot of people turned to news
and talk stations to follow and discuss unfolding developments
regarding the terrorist attacks and military efforts in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, many people wanted to put current events out of
their minds and found sanctuary in familiar oldies, the comfort food
of pop music.</LD>
<TE>   The most dramatic developments in the new numbers, though, are
hard to peg to Sept. 11: In the ratings based on listeners 12 and
older, rock station KROQ-FM (106.7) held on to the overall No. 1
position for the third straight quarter--the first English-language
station to three-peat since KOST-FM (103.5) in 1991--with a 5% share
of the audience, up from its third-place 4.4 share of one year ago.
The station ruled across the board, taking the No. 1 title in
afternoon drive time for deejay Jed the Fish and in the evening slot
for the combination of deejay Stryker and the "Loveline" call-in sex
and health show.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Harvey, who took over morning drive time on urban music
outlet KKBT-FM (100.3) in September 2000, rocketed to the top of the
English morning standings with a 5.8 share of the audience, with only
dominant Spanish-language morning man Renan Almedarez Coello on
KSCA-FM (101.9) ahead of him with a 7.5 share. Harvey's gains led the
way for his station, known as the Beat, to move into third place
overall as compared with an eighth-place slot a year ago, and fifth
in the 2001 summer quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to be sensitive to what happened [Sept. 11] without
completely changing the station," KROQ program director Kevin
Weatherly says.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking at the numbers on the surface, I don't see much change
from before. Honestly, we sort of sensed different interests
immediately following [the attacks], but then there was a need for
people to try to get back to some sense of normalcy and people wanted
to come to the station for relief. But also I do think artists such
as Creed and U2 had great success in the fall and a lot of it had to
do with the message in their music."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, KROQ's core success had at least as much to do
with such bands as L.A.'s Linkin Park, whose "Hybrid Theory" album
was the year's top-seller without carrying overt social messages.</TE>
<TE>   Harvey's success is not as complex.</TE>
<TE>   "He attracts people," says KKBT general manager Nancy Leichter. "I
think a lot of people thought this would be a big news book, a more
serious kind of quarter, but I was pleased to see that Steve and the
Beat did as well as they did. We added more news so people wouldn't
have to leave the station to keep up on events, but a lot of people
were back to regular listening habits by last month."</TE>
<TE>   On the talk front, KFI-AM (640) shot up from a 10th place 3.0
audience share a year ago to a tie for fourth place with a 4.2 share.
Talk stations KABC-AM (790) and KLSX-FM (97.1) also saw gains over
fall 2000, jumping from 2.3/17th place to 2.6/12th and 2.1/20th to
2.5/14th, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   KFI's morning host Bill Handel (5.2) also benefited, coming in
behind Harvey among English-language hosts in the crucial morning
drive time, with KROQ's Kevin &amp; Bean (5.0, the duo's highest rating
ever) and KLSX's L.A. run of Howard Stern's show (4.7) also strong.
Rick Dees, heard on KIIS-FM (102.7) and the station's simulcast
KVVS-FM (97.7), rebounded to 4.4 after the suspension of his attempt
at national syndication, which seems to have diluted his local
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Catering to those overloaded with news, KOST-FM (103.5) rose from
3.8 a year ago to 4.1 this year with its soft-toned oldies and pop
seeing a quarter-end boost as the station devoted December entirely
to holiday music.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about familiar music people could relax and listen to,"
says Roy Laughlin, regional vice president of KOST-owner Clear
Channel Radio. "Whether it's Rod Stewart and Elton John or 'Jingle
Bells' and 'Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer,' they don't care."</TE>
<TE>   A similar boost came at Clear Channel's KHHT-FM (92.3), furthering
steady progress made since initiating a format mixing familiar
old-school R&amp;B and contemporary urban soul. It came in with a 3.0 for
11th place overall, right behind heritage oldies station KRTH-FM
(101.1), holding solid at 3.1. KHHT was particularly strong with
women listeners.</TE>
<TE>   News and Talk Shows</TE>
<TE>   Improved Across U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The local picture is consistent with what has started to emerge in
other major markets as Arbitron survey figures are released.</TE>
<TE>   "Everywhere the news and talk stations did well across the board,"
Ron Rodrigues, editor in chief of weekly trade publication Radio &amp;
Records, says of ratings books from New York, Chicago and
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "Talk stations in L.A., compared year to year, did even better
than in New York. Another format that has done very well is urban. In
L.A., Hot [KHHT] and the Beat did very well, and in New York urban
did spectacularly. It has got to be the music that is driving that.
Urban and rhythmic-flavored pop music became more part of the
mainstream, so more people try those stations with such artists as
Alicia Keys, Usher, Nelly, Ja Rule, those who have gotten crossover
air play at pop stations but urban is their home."</TE>
<TE>   Pat Duffy, vice president and general manager of KRTH and market
captain of the eight L.A. stations owned by Infinity Broadcasting,
including KROQ and news stations KFWB-AM (980) and KNX-AM (1070), is
cautious about drawing any long-term conclusions from the new
figures, though, given the extraordinary circumstances of the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "What you see with this rating book and the effect of 9/11 is it
will be used in averaging with other books and not used [to set
advertising rates] exclusively," Duffy says. "The fall book is
generally a very important sales book, but this will be looked at as
an aberration."</TE>
<TE>   But, seeing KOST's success, KRTH's Duffy says there's one
conclusion he'll carry to next fall.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got news for you," he says. "We'll be playing more Christmas
music next year."</TE>

<CX>   Rick Dees--A report on Arbitron radio ratings in the Jan. 11
Calendar mistakenly reported that national syndication of Rick Dees'
morning show on KIIS-FM (102.7) had been suspended. The show is no longer
simulcast in syndication, but it continues to be syndicated on a one-day
delay.</CX>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Orange County performing arts institutions, South Coast Repertory
and Opera Pacific, have announced new programming plans.</LD>
<LD>   South Coast Rep in Costa Mesa has turned to its leading workhorse,
New York City playwright Richard Greenberg, for this fall's
inauguration of its new, 336-seat second theater.</LD>
<LD>   "The Violet Hour" will trace a day in the life of a novice New
York publisher in 1918. The play will run Nov. 5-24, 2002, on the
Julianne Argyros Stage, the new theater that is part of a $19-million
expansion and renovation of the existing building. "The Violet Hour,"
directed by Evan Yionoulis, is the seventh play by Greenberg produced
at South Coast, starting with "The Extra Man" in 1991.</LD>
<TE>   Another Greenberg play, "The Dazzle," will be the final production
on the 161-seat Second Stage (to be used for rehearsals and new play
development when the new theater opens), running from March 29-April
28, 2002.</TE>
<TE>   All of the Greenberg plays except "The Extra Man" have been world
premieres commissioned by South Coast. Among the others are "Three
Days of Rain," a 1997 work that became a Pulitzer Prize finalist, and
"Everett Beekin," seen in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Opera Pacific, meanwhile, will present three new productions
during its 2002-2003 season in Costa Mesa, including Mozart's
"Abduction From the Seraglio" and Strauss' "Salome," both for the
first time.</TE>
<TE>   Director James Robinson sets the Mozart opera, which usually takes
place in a Turkish harem, on the Orient Express during 1920. (Dates
are Jan. 21-26, 2003.) Ian Judge, who created the inventive staging
of Offenbach's "Tales of Hoffmann" presented by Opera Pacific in
2000, will again collaborate with set and costume designer Tim
Goodchild on the new "Salome" (Feb. 25-March 2, 2003).</TE>
<TE>   The third new production will be "Il Trovatore," staged by the
Belgrade-based Dejan Miladinovic (April 29-May 4, 2003).</TE>
<TE>   The season will open with a production of Puccini's "La Boheme"
borrowed from the Canadian Opera Company (Nov. 5-10, 2002).</TE>
<TE>   Company artistic director John DeMain will conduct all the operas
except "Abduction," which will be led by British conductor Jane
Glover.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Roberto Minczuk's tight control over the Pacific Symphony on
Wednesday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center could have been
a prescription for tedium for the audience and frustration for the
musicians--except for two things.</LD>
<LD>   The 34-year-old Brazilian conductor had so many ideas that the
music unfolded in consistently vivid and interesting ways.</LD>
<LD>   And the orchestra is now at an artistic level where it could give
him virtually everything he wanted in degrees of nuance and
transparency as well as in sheer massed power.</LD>
<TE>   Minczuk made a strong case for the warhorses that opened and
closed this Russian program: the Polovstian Dances from Borodin's
"Prince Igor" and Rimsky-Korsakov's "Scheherazade." Both are real
pieces of music, full of interest and insights, despite their
obvious, irresistible appeal and history of schlock performances.</TE>
<TE>   The conductor treated the works seriously, calibrating the
effects, balancing the sections and enjoying the masterly
orchestrations.</TE>
<TE>   While he might have let the music occasionally be more relaxed and
let the section soloists work more freely, he didn't run roughshod
over them.</TE>
<TE>   Concertmaster Raymond Kobler played his solos with sinuous grace
and warmth, along with fine playing by a long list of other Pacific
principals.</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of the program--Prokofiev's Third Piano
Concerto--needs no defense as serious music. Only the brave and
supremely prepared dare tackle this piece. Lilya Zilberstein made it
look like child's play.</TE>
<TE>   She sped through the steeplechase runs tirelessly and without
missing a note. She defied the eye but not the ear in the passages of
alternating and superimposed hands, defying the notion that two
objects can't occupy the same place at the same time. Her evenness of
touch was extraordinary.</TE>
<TE>   Minczuk didn't abandon his ideas and responsibilities, eliciting
ravishing pianissimos and luxuriating in the composer's quirky
rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   It was a great way for the orchestra to kick in the new year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't ask why "Cheyenne: A Transwestern" at the Lillian Theater works
as well as it does. In her "transwestern," playwright Liz Tuccillo
inverts the macho formula of the vintage Hollywood oater, making the
swaggering gunslingers female and the pouting saloon vamps male.</LD>
<LD>   If that sounds like a silly high concept that could wear thin in
about two minutes--it is, but it doesn't. There's synergy at work
here. Tuccillo and director Craig Carlisle have collaborated before,
on the off-Broadway run of "Joe Fearless." The ease of association is
evident in this production, a cheerful gender-bending shoot- 'em-up
that is flat-out funny from start to finish.</LD>
<LD>   Tuccillo's intentionally generic plot is as slim as a snake on
short rations. A true-blue Sheriff (Susan Ziegler) and her trusty
sisters Josephine (Valerie Long) and Alex (Michele Remsen) must
defend Cheyenne from an evil gang of desperadoes. The evil
gunmen--uh, gunpeople--are Colvita (Gretel Roenfeldt), Bonita (Amy
Scribner) and Mulita (Amy Smallman), also sisters nursing an old
grudge, and vice versa.</LD>
<TE>   The pending showdown has the town's nervous Nellie menfolk, Billy
Jo (Paul Bartholomew), Claude (Erik Passoja) and Ronald (Jim Hanna),
fretting that their significant others will return from the showdown
with ventilated intestines.</TE>
<TE>   Just when you thought the good gal sisters were hopelessly
outnumbered, a Mysterious Stranger (Rita Kane) helps even the odds.</TE>
<TE>   Carlisle renders this western velvet painting with broadly comic
strokes, and his able actors attack their material with inspired
stupidity, not to mention crack timing.</TE>
<TE>   Musical director Steve Altman heads a lively combo, and
singer-guitarist Phillip Rogers contributes some appropriately inane

<TE>   The View Is Different From the 'Mountain'</TE>
<TE>   Jude Narita's powerful one-woman show "Walk the Mountain," at
Highways Performance Space, is an antidote for the commercialism of
"Miss Saigon" and a cautionary tale of warfare American-style.</TE>
<TE>   On Jerry Browning's stark set, wooden grates are suspended around
a central screen on which slides of quotes and photos of real
Vietnamese people are flashed. Narita opens with a creation legend,
telling of how the mountain spirit and the dragon lord begat
offspring that became the Vietnamese. Narita tells of warrior women
who led armies against the Chinese and the French.</TE>
<TE>   Contemporary female heroes are also portrayed.</TE>
<TE>   A female doctor who performed operations without anesthesia
("no-pain medicine") during the "American War" witnesses what may be
latent effects of Agent Orange in the grossly deformed babies she
delivers. A mother prays for her dead sons. A rebel leader remembers
her days in a tiger cage. A young woman recalls turning away from her
family to survive.</TE>
<TE>   Director Darling Narita (Jude's daughter) could tighten up the
pacing at the beginning, but overall she gives the material the
gravity it requires.</TE>
<TE>   Jude Narita's show points out how these people were oppressed by
the Chinese, the French, the Japanese and the Americans. By putting
faces on the enemy, Narita challenges concepts of Vietnam and the war
Americans fought there.</TE>

<HD>A Year in the Life of Fairfax High</HD>
<DH>Television* The PBS series 'Senior Year,' made by an
alumnus, gets up close and personal with the school's diverse student
body.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.L. STANLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When David Zeiger went to L.A.'s Fairfax High School back in the
'60s, it was a white, middle-class place that seemed insulated from
the outside world, where topics didn't get more controversial than
who was dating whom.</LD>
<LD>   Returning more than 30 years later as a documentary filmmaker,
Zeiger knew he would find a much-changed environment in which to set
a series that follows a group of teenagers through a pivotal time in
their lives; still, even he didn't realize the weighty issues his
subjects would confront in a single year--everything from the sudden
death of a classmate to the attempted suicide of one student's
father. As for the school itself, it's now a melting pot of some 60
ethnicities, where a walk down the hallway can mean hearing dozens of
languages.</LD>
<LD>   "I knew Fairfax had changed a lot," said Zeiger, a native Angeleno
who graduated from the public school in 1968. "I wanted to get into
complexities of life in L.A., and urban life in general, and the
tremendous diversity here."</LD>
<TE>   The result is a 13-part series premiering tonight on PBS called
"Senior Year," which trails 15 Fairfax seniors at the turn of the
millennium. It joins a host of recent programs that put teens in the
cinema verite spotlight--HBO Family's "Freshman Year" and the
Fox-turned-PBS series "American High" among them.</TE>
<TE>   In taking on his project as director and producer, Zeiger said he
wanted to give a realistic glimpse into teens' lives and bridge some
gaps in understanding between older and younger generations.</TE>
<TE>   "The gulf between my generation and teens today really scares me,"
he said. "I was trying to counter what I see as the fairly pervasive
myth-making about teenagers. Their life experiences are rarely if
ever dealt with in a real way on TV."</TE>
<TE>   Simply by living in these times, "they're forging a new culture,"
Zeiger said of the current crop of teens, dubbed Generation Y. And
despite being courted by corporate America and dissected by
marketers, they're frequently stereotyped and misunderstood, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Zeiger, through his independent production banner Displaced Films,
had already done one high school-based documentary, "The Band,"
centered on his son Danny's junior year. The show aired as part of
PBS' "P.O.V." series in 1998. He wanted to return to the classroom,
and on a larger scale this time, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to get the best access and subjects, Zeiger spent four
months at Fairfax getting to know students during their junior year.
He originally planned to follow a handful of teens for a four-hour
miniseries, but quickly had a group of 35 youngsters he considered
possible subjects. The project then blossomed, with funding from PBS
and several other sources, into a 13-week series. Zeiger winnowed the
number down to 15 students and, in the process, realized that a
traditional film crew (read: white baby boomers) probably would not
be the way to get close to these teens.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he searched film departments at  USC and UCLA for an
ethnically diverse group of twentysomethings to serve as unit
producers. Six students and recent graduates became his crew and were
assigned, in pairs, to follow two or three Fairfax seniors. They,
too, spent time with the teenagers, without cameras in tow, before
the 1999-2000 school year began.</TE>
<TE>   Once it did, the filmmakers shadowed the teens during everything
from fights with parents and counseling sessions to football practice
and the prom. Jean and Maria, a couple featured in the series (no
last names are used), said that their closeness with the crew made it
easier to share intimate details of their lives, including their
decision to go to church and stop having sex. Jean's life, in
particular, took some dramatic turns during the year. It was his
father who stabbed himself in the family's home as well as his friend
who was hit and killed by a car.</TE>
<TE>   "After a time, we didn't even see the camera," Jean, now 19, said.
"It's because of the crew that I think this is an accurate visual of
what teens are really about."</TE>
<TE>   Executives at the local PBS station, KCET in Hollywood, shepherded
the series to the air. They said the universality of the high school
experience and the poignancy of the storytelling drew them to the
project.</TE>
<TE>   "It's set at a school here in our own backyard, and it deals with
so many larger national issues that we're interested in," said Jackie
Kain, KCET's vice president of new media, who initially brought the
project to public TV and now spearheads the station's Web site. "It
gives a lot of powerful personal stories that show how complex and
smart teens are."</TE>
<TE>   PBS, whose typical viewer is 56 years old, could reach a younger
audience with "Senior Year," as did the critically lauded "American
High," which was picked up after being canceled by Fox. To nudge that
along, the network has developed an extensive Web site for "Senior
Year," featuring additional back story and students, music, message
boards and chat rooms, along with resources to help teens tackle
their problems. There's also a soundtrack from the show, with songs
from L.A. band Ozomatli, Ani DiFranco and former Fairfax student
Unity Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   As with many public television projects, there's a community
outreach program connected to "Senior Year." A national tour starts
next month on the East Coast that will have Zeiger, crew members and
the Fairfax alums visiting schools to screen the series and talk to
teens.</TE>
<TE>   "The project gave us a voice to say, 'Everybody has problems,
everybody goes through the same things,'" Maria, now 19, said. "It's
really important for teenagers to know that."</TE>
<TE>   "Senior Year" premieres tonight at 10 on KCET.</TE>

<HD>Artful 'Symmetry' Entices and Enchants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES MUSIC CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The great popularity of Morton Feldman's very slow, very minimal,
very soft and exceedingly long late chamber works has been fueled by
fine recordings that have been coming out during the last decade. One
such recording is that of the trio "Crippled Symmetry" for flute,
percussion and keyboards, released by members of the California EAR
Unit in 1999. But hearing the score performed live by the EAR Unit
Wednesday night at the Leo S. Bing Theater of the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art demonstrated how little suited Feldman's music is to
recordings, no matter how well done they are.</LD>
<LD>   "Crippled Symmetry" is, by late Feldman standards, of moderate
length. Wednesday's performance lasted one hour and 43 minutes
(Feldman's Second String Quartet can require as many as six hours if
all the repeats are honored). Still, "Crippled Symmetry"--which
unfolds in a single, seamless movement--requires an unusual level of
concentration from performer and listener alike.</LD>
<TE>   Written in 1983, the trio reflects not only Feldman's close
connection with the Abstract Expressionist visual artists of the
1950s and '60s but also his later fascination with the patterns of
Turkish rugs. Looking for musical equivalents to those rugs, he
devised short, elemental melodic patterns, sometimes just a broken
chord or a few repeated notes, that are transformed for relatively
short periods before gracefully evolving into new ones.</TE>
<TE>   Each instrument works in its own time frame, never simultaneous
with the others but never far apart. As the trio moves over its
generous time frame, one sits back, the heart rate slows and the
process of this music takes over a listener's consciousness. Some
sleep (Feldman himself could be caught napping during performances),
some go into other states of consciousness, some just listen.
Everyone approaches this music on his or her own terms, but somehow
this music creates a collective consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   That is the greatness of Feldman's art. Wednesday, it was the
result of ever-enchanting sounds and the contagion of concentration
from three persuasive performers--flutist Dorothy Stone,
percussionist Amy Knoles (Arthur Jarvinen performed on the ensemble's
recording) and pianist Vicki Ray.</TE>
<TE>   Visual composer that he was, Feldman understood just how much the
ear can be affected by observing the ritual of three musicians
utterly absorbed but never tense, producing continual subtle tone
with precision for long spans of time.</TE>
<TE>   There is not a trace of drama in this trance-like music, but there
is nothing but drama in the sustained effort of making it. Single
notes from the celesta float around the hall like a kind of sonic
confetti, the bass flute creates the acoustical effect of expanding
and contracting viscous liquids, the glockenspiel and vibraphone seem
to distill the essence of bright and muted musical colors.</TE>
<TE>   The performance was amplified. The instruments carry perfectly
well unassisted in the Bing, but the sound design by Gregory Kuhn
gave the impression that the instruments were quieter, not louder,
than normal, with the effect of drawing us into the music, not of the
music coming at us.</TE>
<TE>   And that quality, more than any other, is impossible to achieve on
a recording. The "Crippled Symmetry" CD is a nice addition to your
house; in the Bing on Wednesday, it was a memorable addition to one's
life.</TE>

<HD>Eden, Hanson Drop In on 'Sabrina'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Sabrina, the Teenage Witch" has long been a bit of a throwback to
the '60s sitcom tradition. So it's fitting that we now have an
episode featuring Barbara Eden, one of that era's icons, and the pop
group Hanson, in one of TV land's most timeworn devices.</LD>
<LD>   In tonight's show (8 p.m., the WB), Eden is billed as making her
first sitcom appearance since "I Dream of Jeannie" ended its original
five-year run in 1970. Given her work in so many other venues over
the years, from guest roles on "Dallas" to those L'eggs pantyhose
commercials to movies, theater and various TV specials, it's hard to
believe she's been away from the format so long.</LD>
<LD>   This time, instead of playing a fun-loving, mischief-making though
subservient genie, Eden is bossy Great Aunt Irma, matriarch of the
Spellman family and "holy terror of the other realm." Aunt Irma has
gotten wind of the fact that Sabrina's ex-boyfriend (Nate Richert)
knows that Sabrina (Melissa Joan Hart) is a witch, and she has come
to grill him on whether he can be trusted with the secret. It's also
Sabrina's birthday, which adds to the young witch's problems as only
a classic sitcom formula can.</LD>
<TE>   Eden and company play her appearance straight, with no post-ironic
hints of her former TV life in a bottle, save for one use of the
Jeannie-esque phrase "Very well" before a bit of magic. In this
context, keeping the self-referential humor to a minimum is entirely
appropriate. It's also worth noting that Eden is scheduled to return
as Aunt Irma in a second episode next month. The materialization of
teen-pop trio Hanson in tonight's episode doesn't work nearly as
well. Eldest brother Isaac, we are told, was the boyfriend of Roxie
(Soleil Moon Frye) before he became famous, and now he's coming for
dinner. But circumstances conspire, and wouldn't you know it, he and
his brothers are playing their yet-to-be-released song "Strong Enough
to Break" before a spellbound on-screen audience.</TE>
<TE>   Though the segment feels shoehorned into the show, it may play
nicely with "Sabrina's" young demographic.</TE>

<HD>A Hero With All the Wrong Moves</HD>
<DH>Television* In Telemundo's wildly popular 'Pedro el
Escamoso,' a loser who thinks he's the Man has won viewers' hearts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WILTZ</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>There is the mullet--so '80s, so terribly declasse. The ensemble:
those high-water britches, the plaid jacket, the floral tie--declasse
even in the '80s. The vaguest hint of an overbite, the unibrow, the
corny come-ons. "Pedro el Escamoso" isn't the kind of guy whose very
presence would start a quiet riot in the middle of a suburban mall.</LD>
<LD>   And yet, he did. Pedro the Playa, the guy with the disastrous
dance moves, caused enough of a commotion--3,000 fans' worth of
commotion--to shut down Westfield Shoppingtown Wheaton (Md.) Plaza on
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Wheaton had never seen the likes of this. Neither had the
Telemundo network's local executives, who said they expected about
500 fans.</LD>
<TE>   Pedro, however, has. In spades.</TE>
<TE>   "This happened in Colombia, in Ecuador, in Venezuela and now in
Washington," said Miguel Varoni, star of "Pedro el Escamoso," a
wildly popular telenovela and Colombia's hottest export since "Betty
la Fea."</TE>
<TE>   "In Colombia, they had to cancel [the appearance] because there
were too many people," Varoni says. "They rescheduled it. The next
week, 60,000 people showed up."</TE>
<TE>   They show up because in Varoni's sendup of all things machismo,
he's struck a chord. There's charm in his cluelessness.</TE>
<TE>   Pedro el Escamoso (the name is hard to translate, with meanings
ranging from "the flaky one" to "the pretender wannabe") is the
would-be Casanova of the Colombian telenovela, serving up soulful
glances and wicked winks, a wild and crazy guy who believes his own
hype and lives in a world of illusion where he's the star of his own
romance fantasy. He really, really, really thinks he is el
chacho--the Man.</TE>
<TE>   These days, judging by his ratings, U.S. audiences think so too.
That's amusing, considering that Pedro is the kind of guy who, on a
first date, takes off his jacket and flexes a muscle, revealing a
tattoo emblazoned on his bulging biceps: "(Insert your name here) and
Pedro."</TE>
<TE>   According to Alejandro Riera, arts and entertainment writer of
Chicago-based Spanish-language newspaper Exito!, Pedro pleases
because he sends up the realities of Colombia: life on the streets,
the working stiffs struggling to make it. Pedro provides someone
viewers can relate to, no matter where they hail from across Latin
America's vastness.</TE>
<TE>   "As a Latin American, you realize there are points of convergence,
that what you see in Colombia is what you're seeing in Mexico or in
Santurce [Puerto Rico]," Riera says. "You can find this guy walking
down the street. Or go to any nightclub in San Juan, and there he'll
be."</TE>
<TE>   Tales of the Nerds</TE>
<TE>   Who Yearn for Love</TE>
<TE>   Normally, telenovelas are the province of the rich and the
beautiful. But starting with the recent "Betty la Fea" (Betty the
Ugly), a new type of telenovela star emerged: homely, humble, with
origins firmly rooted in the ordinary. Ana Maria Orozco starred as a
heroine with greasy hair, blackheads, glasses and braces.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 80 million viewers tuned in to watch the tale of the
nerd who yearned for love, only to be rejected again and again. Her
make-over was hotly debated by everyone from feminists to politicos.</TE>
<TE>   After Betty waltzed off with her prince in the final episode (a
telenovela's lifespan is about 18 months), there was a vacuum. Enter
Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   "Pedro is a man who thinks he knows everything," Varoni says. "But
he's a good person. He wants the whole world to be happy. He wants
everyone to be happy around him."</TE>
<TE>   In that vein, we asked Varoni to lay it on thick. Varoni, talking
from his crib in Bogota, was only too happy to oblige.</TE>
<TE>   "Divina mujer," he crooned, "cosita linda--that means pretty baby,
pretty woman--amor de mis amores--love of my love--boquita de
caramelo ... honey mouth.... "</TE>
<TE>   Hmmm. Maybe the geek does have game.</TE>
<TE>   "Pedro el Escamoso" can be seen locally weeknights at 8 on
KVEA-TV.</TE>

<LD>At the American Music Awards show Wednesday at the Shrine, music
celebrities came backstage to chat about everything from fashion to
problems with the law and the feud between this event and the
Grammys.</LD>
<LD>   Nick Carter of the Backstreet Boys, who had a run-in with a
Florida police officer earlier this month, said the tussle was
already behind him. If the officer "disrespected me, or if I did,
it's all over now," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Carter was arrested after allegedly refusing to follow police
officers' orders to leave a Tampa nightclub after a fight broke out.
According to Jennifer  Guggino, an eyewitness, the 21-year-old
Backstreet Boy cried when he was arrested. Guggino told reporters at
Thesmokinggun.com: "Nick wasn't belligerent, but he started bawling.
He said, 'You just want to arrest a Backstreet Boy. I've never been
arrested. I don't know what to do!' ... Tears were streaming down his
face. People were laughing at him. The cops were chuckling."</LD>
<TE>   Carter was booked on a misdemeanor count of resisting/opposing an
officer without violence and later was released.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just going to go away," Carter said Wednesday with
confidence. "I'm not a bad person; I have never been a bad person."
Easy, there. We weren't suggesting you're an evildoer. Please ...
don't cry.</TE>
<TE>   'N Sync offered more laughs. When asked about the battle of the
award shows, Justin Timberlake said, "We don't play the political
game." Band member Chris Kirkpatrick added, "Now, that's a good
political answer."</TE>
<TE>   Timberlake, who is dating Britney Spears, was caught on camera
earlier in the evening cheering after a Spears performance. When a
reporter asked about it, Timerberlake joked: "Well, last night I was
thinking, 'What way can I get on camera?' So I used her performance."</TE>
<TE>   Then came Destiny's Child, who made Mr. Blackwell's annual
worst-dressed list.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about that dubious honor, Beyonce Knowles innocently
asked, "Who is Mr. Blackman?" Admonishing him, she added: "Observe
yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of fashion, India.Arie said her mother had made her award
show outfit--an orange dress which she wore over jeans. "She'd be mad
if she knew I wore this hat with it," she said, pointing to a denim
hat.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, I'm Cher," said Cher. Despite her new blond look, most
reporters and critics knew who she was. The singer, a pre-Sept. 11
critic of George Bush, was asked what she would say about him now.
"He's the president," she replied, and left it at that.</TE>
<TE>   Then Sheryl Crow popped in, and commented on the awards show feud.
She hopes it will be resolved before next year. "I'm a lover, not a
fighter," the singer joked.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of love, we hold a torch for Garth Brooks, who took home
an Award of Merit. The country singer talked about balancing his
career and family life, before paying homage to James Taylor. "You
know the saying, 'If you meet your heroes they won't be your heroes
anymore?'" Not true in this case. When the two met, Brooks was blown
away because Taylor knew the name of everyone in Brooks' family,
including the nanny. "It was just 007 stuff," Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jackson ended the evening on a surreal note. Receiving an
artist of the century award, Jackson thanked his mother and father,
as well as Quincy Jones, Diana Ross and "my other father, Marlon
Brando."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Case Closed?</TE>
<TE>   "Family Ties" star-turned-rock singer Tina Yothers may have
cleared her debt to her former public relations company, ending an
eight-month legal battle. Yothers appeared Thursday in a Beverly
Hills court and wrote a personal check to Steve Levesque's Luck Media
&amp; Marketing for $5,050, money that a judge ruled she owed him for
promoting her rock band, Jaded. "As long as the check clears, we
don't have to return [to court]," Levesque told us. "That's all I
wanted from the beginning--to get paid for the work."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FYI ...</TE>
<TE>   The giant banner atop Hollywood &amp; Highland featuring a
midriff-baring Britney Spears enjoying a Pepsi was recently blown
down by high winds. "We have every intention of replacing it. We're
investigating ways to keep it more sturdy," complex spokeswoman Beth
Harris told us. Harris dismissed rumors that Hollywood Hills
residents demanded the banner removed because it spoiled their views.</TE>

<HD>Novelist Plays Private Eye in His Ragged New Orleans</HD>
<DH>GHOST OF A FLEA: A Novel By James Sallis; Walker &amp; Co.; 238
pages, $23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAI MARISTED</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Veteran novelist James Sallis has a knack for pairing the laconic
with the metaphysical, the cozily quotidian with the surreal. His
eighth, just-published tale, "Ghost of a Flea," draws the reader into
a strange and richly populated universe. In twists and turns of
bizarre incident and poignant human encounters, the story traverses
the alleys and gator-tail joints, bars and hospital wards of one
man's New Orleans--a city ragged with the violence that proceeds from
poverty and entrenched inequality, populated by homeless loners who
fight back with whimsy, madness and wit.</LD>
<LD>   "Across the street, someone dressed all in gray, as though wearing
the tatters of the night itself, hove into view. He carried an
old-fashioned red kerosene lantern, swinging it back and forth and
shouting what well might have been ... All aboard! ... [Or] Bring out
your dead, or searching for an honest man, or just seeking warmth.</LD>
<LD>   "Surprising how we subtropical folk got used to the cold. ... An
adaptable lot. I stood now, blanketless, chill, watching the plume of
my breath stream out ..."</LD>
<TE>   As viewed through 50-something Lew Griffin's eyes, this New
Orleans bears scant kinship to the hokey Disneyland tourists in
busloads come hoping to find.</TE>
<TE>   Griffin is a former college teacher, a black man with roots in
rural Arkansas, a collector and lover of classic jazz and poetry from
Blake to Apollinaire to Whitman, and an inveterate quoter of the
same, a man with a weakness for strong beautiful women and, less
felicitously, strong whiskey. Like his creator, Griffin has been a
novelist and social chronicler of his city--although (evidently quite
unlike his creator) all his books are out of print and his life has
been weighed down for years by a massive, melancholy writer's block.</TE>
<TE>   Sallis (also a poet, biographer, translator and critic) plays
openly with this alter-ego relationship--smitten characters lavishly
praise the fictional writer's books, while Griffin riffs to us, his
audience, on the consumerization of art, on the lineage of black
writing in America ("distress signals in code"), on the way a novel,
once finished, blurs in the writer's mind. He describes in detail (a
mirror effect for this reader) his laborious approach to composing a
book review. Sallis' and Griffin's agents even share the same first
name.</TE>
<TE>   Griffin happens also to be a former detective, which helps explain
why certain folk in town still turn to him instinctively for help. In
this, the fifth and purportedly final volume of a series, a number of
disparate problems and puzzlers seem to converge on Griffin nearly
simultaneously, ranging from an epidemic of fatal paralysis among
park pigeons to a nameless, flayed and skinless corpse found in
possession of Griffin's runaway son's wallet, to a series of
anonymous, veiled threats against his adored goddaughter, who has
just given birth.</TE>
<TE>   For all their gravity, one senses that the troubles from outside
afford Griffin some relief, some counterweight, to the long-festering
troubles inside: the drinking, the depressive shadow connecting back
to his mother and forward to his son, the gradual and triste
dissolution of his current relationship, the pain of drifting: " ...
condemned without pardon to our own lives and minds, those islands of
self."</TE>
<TE>   Does "Ghost of a Flea" boil down then to a first-rate genre novel,
sub-category detective or suspense, as the jacket illustration of a
bludgeoned lovely, along with other nods to convention, suggests?
Certainly, in the sense that "Crime and Punishment," "The Castle" or
"Pale Fire" might also qualify.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Griffin (along with Sallis) would rest uneasily
on the same shelf as Ross MacDonald or even Raymond Chandler and
Patricia Highsmith (both alluded to in these pages, the latter
misspelled "Patrician" in a shameless, good-humored nudge). The poet
Sallis betrays himself on every page with an inordinate desire to
capture a nuance of light, essence of cat or waver of a farewell. His
prose style is witty, elliptical and heady with image and allusion;
his bedrock underlying purpose is nothing less than an exploration of
meaning and identity.</TE>
<TE>   No mistaking: Regardless of labels, "Ghost of a Flea" bears the
marks of a fierce and original writer working at full power. Though
the journey with Griffin can be jolting and leave one longing for
maps, there is the pleasure of his warm heart and irrepressibly
playful mind--not to mention stops for some wonderful New Orleans
cooking along the way.</TE>
<TE>   And just as you near the end of Griffin's story and are preparing,
reluctantly, to step off, the penultimate chapter explodes on the
page, extending strands of light that tie together previously
unconnected elements with stunning clarity. And still it's not over,
for there is one more short chapter to go, only the length of an
afterthought, and yet, with the power to rotate this whole fictional
universe, leave it suspended upside-down long enough for the reader
to race back to the beginning of the story and ride it again.</TE>

<LD>It is clear that Sandy Banks shares the "human element" in all of
us--that we would like to try to lose those extra pounds.
("Weight-Loss Goals: No More Pie in the Sky," Jan. 1).</LD>
<LD>   As entertaining as her column is, she missed the boat on this one.
More Americans will die this year from obesity and weight-related
diseases than from our current new fear, bioterrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Our youngest generation is succumbing to high cholesterol, type 2
diabetes and hypertension at rates previously unrecorded.</LD>
<TE>   We are not getting the message that our desires to satisfy our
taste buds and our hankering for processed foods, coupled with
inactivity, is leading us down a path to destruction.</TE>
<TE>   We do not need to lose a certain number of pounds by a certain
time period. Small changes such as reducing portion sizes,
substituting fruit for snacks, limiting soda intake and a short walk
after a large meal can help most overweight individuals.</TE>
<TE>   I am sympathetic to individuals who attempt to battle obesity and
who fail repeatedly because of lack of instruction or education or
support from the medical and health community. But when I hear a
mother on a fad diet tell me her child subsists on fast food and
processed foods at age 6, I feel a sense of anger and helplessness.</TE>
<TE>   We need to make lifestyle education a top priority--in our homes,
in our schools, at our workplaces, and in the government forum.</TE>
<TE>   Make a New Year's resolution to adopt little, doable changes in
the lifestyle of your entire family.</TE>

<LD>I can't believe that someone would actually pay $65 an hour to have
someone else pick lice and nits out of their child's hair ("Getting
the Bugs Out, Jan. 7). Doesn't anyone act like a parent anymore? Buy
the shampoo and do it yourself!</LD>
<LD>   Picking nits out of your child's hair is a great chance to spend
quality time with your child. You can cuddle, engage in conversation,
have them read to you or share a good movie.</LD>
<LD>   As much as I hated dealing with the little critters and their
offspring on several occasions, the time I spent with my children was
wonderful.</LD>
<TE>   On the other hand, I would have paid someone $65, or more, to
delouse the beds, furniture, etc.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Low-Tech Postings of His Holiday Loneliness," Dec. 28: At
the very young age of 24, this loser has already thrown away his wife
and two kids, whom he visits "here and there." These children, whom
he chose to bring into the world, deserve to be with their father at
least half the time ... that would surely cure his loneliness.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding "Sappers Seek to Zap a Most Menacing Enemy" (Dec. 21): In
December 1997, in Ottawa, Canada, 123 nations pledged to ban the use,
production or shipment of antipersonnel mines. Even U.S. Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf endorsed the ban. But while as many as 26,000 people a
year are being killed (mostly innocent civilians in developing
countries), four countries did not endorse the ban. Sadly, the United
States was one of them. Since Sept. 11, one would hope that America's
concern for the tragic loss of innocent lives would be heightened and
extend to other countries as well. Banning this "garbage weapon"
would go a long way in signifying America's concern for the loss of
innocent lives everywhere.</LD>

<HD>These Moms Are Motivated More by Economics Than Parenting</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was excited to learn that there seems to be a trend toward educated
women choosing to postpone career pursuits in favor of full-time
motherhood ("Mommy, Me and an Advanced Degree," Jan. 6).</LD>
<LD>   Could it be that these professionally trained moms are finally
realizing the value of consistent care taking for their developing
infants?</LD>
<LD>   Not according to the article. The decision seems to be primarily a
matter of economics ("a lagging economy") and personal preoccupations
("the horror of watching so many working professionals perish in the
terrorist attacks" or "it isn't worth it to work even part-time if it
means missing her son's rapid growth").</LD>
<TE>   Where does the importance of the parent-child bond to the infant's
basic sense of trust and healthy self-esteem fit in? Apparently, from
the point of view of the New Millennium Mom, it's still "all about
me."</TE>

<DH>Louboutin has built his luxury brand of shoes by
emphasizing aesthetics, not utility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>lv-louboutin11 -- French shoe designer Christian
Louboutin in L.A. w/art. BOOTH MOORE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the rush to forecast fashion trends during these last few
months, some have gone so far as to declare the demise of the
stiletto and the rise of the sensible shoe.</LD>
<LD>   But Christian Louboutin isn't having any of that. It's aesthetics
after all, not utility, that drive his shoe designs. "The last thing
I would like is for people to point to my shoes and say, 'Oh, they
look so comfortable!'" says the French designer whose styles have
joined Manolos and Jimmy Choos in the realm of swoon-worthy fashion
accessories that need no explanatory nouns. (The name alone
suffices.)</LD>
<LD>   In a decade of designing his own line, Louboutin has managed to
inspire the kind of fashion fervor others merely dream of. But
instead of pushing in-your-face glam on anyone willing to whip out an
Amex card a la Gucci's Tom Ford, Louboutin has quietly built his
luxury brand by carefully controlling distribution. His shoes are
"one of the few real luxury items remaining because he doesn't feel
his things need to be everywhere and on everyone," says Rita Watnick,
who persuaded Louboutin to open his second U.S. store next to her
vintage clothing shop in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<TE>   In the boudoir-like Louboutin boutique, his pricey little
darlings, $335 to $1,100, are treated like treasures. Each display
shoe has its own alcove on the wall and, for those who inquire, a
name. The "100 Meter" is a modified white leather track shoe with a
pointy heel and toe. The "India Jane" is a Tarzan-meets-the-Raj pump
that drapes the foot in red chiffon and fastens at the ankle with a
clasp of cascading rhinestones. "L'ecole est fini" is a backless,
open-toed denim mule inspired by the last day of school before summer
vacation.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when the kids cut the toes off their shoes and go to the
beach!" says Louboutin, 37, who only recently was able to see his
completed L.A. store because a Sept. 15 opening party had to be
canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Louboutin has been in the footwear business for nearly 20 years,
first as an apprentice at Charles Jourdan, later as a freelance
designer for Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent and now on his own. The
son of a furniture maker, he has four sisters. He is closest to
Farida Khelfa, 38, a former model whom he calls his "house muse."</TE>
<TE>   Louboutin says he has never once wanted to design clothes, and
he's not particularly interested in men's shoes either. (He wears
nondescript brown desert boots.)</TE>
<TE>   "A woman carries her clothing, but it's the shoe which carries a
woman. It's a very specific, different item," he says, flourishing
his left hand for emphasis. "A shoe for me is like a pedestal for a
woman."</TE>
<TE>   Because so many of his shoes have stories behind them, Louboutin
says he often feels as if he is flipping through a scrapbook when he
visits his stores. One of his most talked-about designs, the "trash
mule" ($335) was born out of a conversation with a friend about the
conflict between fashion and recycling, he says.</TE>
<TE>   The shoe, which has cigarette butts, magazine clippings, feathers
and other rubbish encased in a clear plastic toe, was so popular when
it came out three years ago that there have been several versions of
it in seasons since.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the one everyone wants, and it's the hardest one to make,"
he says, shrugging.</TE>
<TE>   Louboutin learned to appreciate shoes as sculpture from his work
with Roger Vivier, who is perhaps most famous for designing shoes for
Christian Dior in the 1950s. In 1988, Louboutin helped the French
master mount a retrospective at the Musee de la Mode et du Textiles.
The experience gave him the confidence to start his own business.</TE>
<TE>   The slight designer's English is peppered with "et ceteras,"
making him sound like Yul Brynner in "The King and I." He opened his
first shop in Paris in 1991, choosing a spot next to an antiques
store because he says he wanted to attract customers who would look
at shoes as design objects, not just footwear. Stores in London and
New York followed, and now he seems very at home sprawled out,
diva-like, on a Moroccan bench in his Burton Way boutique.</TE>
<TE>   "In France, it's not politically correct to like Los Angeles. You
can like New York, but you dislike Los Angeles," says Louboutin, who
is full of theories and likes it here, despite being a consummate
Parisian.</TE>
<TE>   Behind him, shoes are posed like dancers, each one with a
spotlight trained on it. "I love that he's such an artisan," says
Watnick. "Do you know why the soles of all of his shoes are red?
Because to him, shoes had always looked unfinished."</TE>
<TE>   Louboutin does not have a house in L.A., and he isn't actively
looking for one. He already divides his time among Paris, New York
and a houseboat in Luxor, Egypt. Still, he won't rule out the
possibility. "If I find something I really like, I might have to get
it."</TE>
<TE>   His recent visit was a chance not only to see the completed store,
but to deliver a pair of custom-made, non-leather shoes to animal
lover Drew Barrymore. Louboutin "adores" Hollywood actors in the same
way that he "adores" showgirls. As a boy, he was a regular at Paris
revues, which inspired him to become a designer. "It was either
feathers or shoes," he says, all charm.</TE>
<TE>   Fans of his creations include socialites Catherine Deneuve,
Princess Caroline of Monaco and Princess Marie Chantal of Greece,
celebs Elizabeth Taylor, Sarah Jessica Parker and Cameron Diaz. But
Louboutin won't be joining Jimmy Choo in the Academy Awards designer
derby.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't like to have my shoes pushed and pushed and pushed,"
he says. "Besides, if you are too spoiled, you don't see the value of
things."</TE>

<HD>A Real Dressing-Down</HD>
<DH>Mr. Blackwell's annual list of fashion victims dogs the
togs of 'a Hogwarts horror' and 'a Swan Lake mistake.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES SENIOR FASHION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though he's recovering from throat surgery, Mr. Blackwell mustered
his energy--and usual caustic wit--to release his 42nd annual "Best
and Worst Dressed Women" list. The 76-year-old designer and critic
almost put the list aside after the tragedies in September, he said
in a news release, "but after some thought, I felt some traditions
(however frivolous) should continue."</LD>
<LD>   Though his best-dressed list is weighted with women who earned
fashion accolades for their red-carpet style, including Julia
Roberts, Joan Allen, Renee Zellweger, Nicole Kidman, Gwyneth Paltrow
and Penelope Cruz, he also included TV talking heads Diane Sawyer,
Katie Couric, Oprah Winfrey and star soprano Renee Fleming.</LD>
<LD>   As for the worst dressed, well, let's allow Mr. Blackwell to tell
it:</LD>
<TE>   10. Gillian Anderson: "A grunge plunge resembling an escape from a
Bohemian barbecue."</TE>
<TE>   9. Cameron Diaz: "Chaos in high heels, period!"</TE>
<TE>   8. Camilla Parker Bowles: "Packs the stylistic punch of a
dilapidated Yorkshire pudding!"</TE>
<TE>   7. Kate Hudson: "Looks like a cyclone victim from the OK Corral."</TE>
<TE>   6. Princess Stephanie: "Her wardrobe has the allure of nuclear
waste. Sorry, no taste!"</TE>
<TE>   5. Bjork: "A Swan Lake mistake. A pretentious fashion folly in a
nightmare by Salvador Dali!"</TE>
<TE>   4. Destiny's Child: "A trilogy of taste-free terror hitting a
crescendo of off-pitch kitsch. Three peas in a peek-a-boo pod!"</TE>
<TE>   3. Juliette Binoche: "A haute couture catastrophe. Let's just dub
her 'La Gauche Binoche' and leave it at that!"</TE>
<TE>   2. Britney Spears: "What's left to say? Britney's belly-baring
bombs are a wacky tacky display."</TE>
<TE>   1. Anne Robinson: "Fashion's weakest link. Looks like Harry Potter
in drag, a Hogwarts horror."</TE>
<TE>   When the fashion industry gathers in New York next month to
preview the 2002 fall collections, they will find a considerably
smaller affair than usual. The downsizing reflects concerns following
the spring presentations in September, which were canceled midweek
because of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   When buyers and journalists  convene Feb. 8, they'll see a New
York season split between two small tents in Bryant Park and three
new venues in SoHo, a subway ride south. The Bryant Park location at
42nd Street and 6th Avenue has housed up to four tents in past years,
while galleries, showrooms and hotel ballrooms have been pressed into
service to accommodate the overflow. The two Bryant Park tents will
be smaller than before, seating about 700 and 424 people, down from
about 800 seats for the largest tents in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "The decision to change the venues in the park stemmed from
discussions we've had with designers after Sept. 11," said Fern
Mallis, executive director of 7th on Sixth, the producer of fashion
week. "Sept. 11 has changed everyone's attitude, creating a new
sensibility amongst the industry and a climate which has affected
everyone's bottom line.  Our industry, like most, has become more
introspective, and a smaller, more intimate atmosphere was the
general consensus," she said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Scott, the American designer who recently relocated from
Paris to Los Angeles, will make his New York debut next month, as
will British designer Matthew Williamson.</TE>

<HD>Book Sparks, in a Word, Controversy</HD>
<DH>Randall Kennedy's discourse on the 'N-word' is embraced by
some for its boldness and criticized by others for glossing over the
world of hip-hop.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN SANDLER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>'Deep in the streets" is not how anyone would describe Randall
Kennedy. Each morning he commutes from his home in suburban Boston to
Harvard Law School. His office there is a cacophony of casebooks and
culture. Sarah Vaughan tapes and Philip Roth novels join the clutter
that surrounds his large desk. He sits behind stacks of papers in a
gray tailored suit that complements the gray hairs that curl around
his temples.</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy, who wrote 1997's acclaimed "Race, Crime, and the Law," is
the author of a pithy new book with an eye-catching title: "Nigger:
The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word." Already the book has
spawned debate about how the "troublesome word" can and should be
used.</LD>
<LD>   Under discussion as well is whether a book about the word, even
one by an Ivy League legal scholar, can avoid the monolith of hip-hop
culture--the word's primary arena these days. Kennedy's book owes far
more to the canonized texts of jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. than
to the lyrics of Ice Cube. And to some critics, that means that the
law professor's reading stops short of capturing the difficult issues
surrounding the word's popularity in some circles.</LD>
<TE>   Kennedy, who is black, says he never set out to write a definitive
history of the word. One day, just out of curiosity, he searched for
"nigger" in the electronic database Lexis-Nexis to see what would
come up. Thousands of documents later, he crafted his findings into a
series of guest lectures he delivered at Stanford University in 1999.
Kennedy mentioned his lectures to his literary agent, who suggested
he pass them on to Erroll McDonald, who had edited his previous book
at Pantheon. Three weeks later, Kennedy says, "That was that.
Finished. Finito. We had a book."</TE>
<TE>   This is the first book to emerge that purports to chart and assess
the word's expansive history. Kennedy starts off with the word's
etymology (from "niger," Latin for black) and then embarks upon a
quick tour of the word's place in history. He begins his journey in
the estate records from the 17th century and roams onward  through
overtly racist jokes and personal experiences of black icons from
Richard Wright to Tiger Woods.  In his central chapter, "Nigger in
Court," Kennedy essentially puts the "protean N-word" on trial in
history's courtrooms, examining the legal spheres of education and
employment, as well as the infamous testimony of Mark Fuhrman in the
O.J. Simpson murder trial. The book then expands its focus to
scrutinize use and reactions to the word in the culture, including
controversies over using the word in dictionaries, and how it plays
in humor from "Amos 'n' Andy" to Chris Rock.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, Kennedy repeatedly steps aside to reiterate that he
deems the word a slippery, malleable thing and to argue for the
"renovation" of the word as a "linguistic landmark"--and even a term
of endearment and empowerment. "For bad and for good," he concludes,
"'nigger' is thus destined to remain with us for the foreseeable
future--a reminder of the ironies and dilemmas, the tragedies and
glories, of the American experience."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy is entirely aware of the fury he stirs with the argument
that the word's use does not always constitute hate speech but needs
to be judged in context. And in the context of this book's sales and
marketing, the word has proved to be incendiary. Since the title's
announcement, enraged correspondents have sent Kennedy heaps of mail.
He glories in the thought of confronting readers with their
uneasiness about the word. He says with a smirk that he envisions
them walking into bookstores to ask, "Have you got any 'Niggers'"
in?' or "Do you folks carry that 'Nigger' I've read about?"</TE>
<TE>   In the Pantheon offices, the title has befuddled some of the
people who have worked to publish the book. "There are some people
who have not been able to bring themselves to say the title," says
editor McDonald. "I myself have been known to yell, 'Say the title!
Say "Nigger!" Say it!'"</TE>
<TE>   Says Kennedy: "There's a whole chapter to be added to the book
about how people talk about it and avoid talking about it."</TE>
<TE>   Comedian and activist Dick Gregory has seen this territory before.
In 1964, he scandalously titled his autobiography "Nigger" in an
attempt to claim the word and eliminate its lethal sting.</TE>
<TE>   He had long dreamed of forcing the word into white dinner party
conversations and book clubs, wielding rather than complying with its
power. "I had practically an all-white audience back then," he says,
"and I would get on stage and hold up the book and say, 'Take a
nigger to bed with you tonight.' It cost me millions, but I did what
I wanted to do, and we won--we put it out there."</TE>
<TE>   He's thrilled that Kennedy has followed his lead in titling his
book. "I hope he gets T-shirts made of the book cover--and if he
won't, I'll do it for him!"</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, Gregory was a harbinger of a linguistic revolution.
With the spread of hip-hop came a mass cultural effort to transform
the word from a verbal assault weapon to a self-selected identity
marker.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at a band like NWA--literally 'Niggaz With
Attitude'--and they made the word a standard with their first record
in '88. They made the word essential in hip-hop," says Nelson George,
the author of "Hip Hop America," who is producing his own documentary
examining the word in American culture. "NWA took something that was
on the street and brought it into the culture, and that's the recent
history of it."</TE>
<TE>   But that recent history is barely evident in Kennedy's book. While
the chapter "Nigger in Court" earns 60 of the book's 175 pages,
Kennedy's nod to youth culture and hip-hop is just a few paragraphs.
Even the ancient history of "Amos 'n' Andy" earns a more in-depth
look.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly didn't make a conscious decision to minimize hip-hop
in the book," says Kennedy, whose general interest in hip-hop can be
supported by the Public Enemy tape that resides on one of his many
cluttered bookshelves. "But the focus of the book reflects my
predominant interest. You know, 'lawyer,'" he says pointing a thumb
at his gray tie with a smile. And as a lawyer, Kennedy is mainly
concerned about sticking to sources that could be "checked out in a
library" as he makes his case that the word is ambiguous, not
anathema.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to be very punctilious in setting forth my sources in the
N-word project," says Kennedy. Language noted: Kennedy, for all the
spunk of his book's title, generally doesn't use the word in his own
conversation. "I don't casually use the term. I'll say it if I'm
retelling a joke. Or recounting what someone has said. Otherwise, I
prefer to vary my language," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But Kennedy hardly represents all denizens of the academy.
"Nigga--that's n-i-g-g-a--is my favorite word," says USC cinema
studies professor Todd Boyd, who plans to take on the word in his
upcoming book about how hip-hop's cultural values won out over those
of the civil rights movement. His book "The New HNIC"--an acronym for
Head Nigger in Charge--will liberally sample from hip-hop. He says
it's impossible to offer an in-depth analysis of the genre's history
without a significant focus on its use of the word.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the real long-overdue debate, what's been circulating in
the culture--but you'll see nobody has sat down to discuss it, not
even Randall Kennedy," says Boyd.</TE>
<TE>   Hip-hop is "the reason why we can even have this conversation
now--the book wouldn't be out there if that wasn't the case," says
Michael Anthony Neal, a professor at the State University of New York
at Albany and the author of "Soul Baby" and "What the Music Said."
Neal believes the problem is that 47-year-old Kennedy lies on the
other side of a generational divide.</TE>
<TE>   And this is exactly how McDonald defends the book's omissions.
"It's precisely because it is a generational issue," he says. "I
believe that there are actually two sets of discussions about the
word. There's the discussion of the word as it pertains to hip-hop
culture, and there's the other history of it and how that pertains to
people who grew up at a certain time in American history. So those
two discussions, even though they might inform each other, are not
necessarily of one piece."</TE>
<TE>   The apparent contradiction is that Kennedy's main argument in the
book relies on a complete examination of context in judging the
word's use. As he writes: "What should ultimately matter most is the
context in which the word is spoken--the speaker's aims, effects,
alternatives."</TE>
<TE>   To many critics, this argument is a clear one. Given a clearly
intended context, "nigga," and sometimes even "nigger," can be used
effectively and appropriately as a term of friendship and even of
pride and power. And in a more limited sense, Kennedy also approves
of use of the word by people who are not black "within the confines
of a relationship," such as that of the friendship he describes
between the writers Langston Hughes and Carl Van Vechten.</TE>
<TE>   Whether white youths should use the word freely--a particularly
thorny postmodern development that has proliferated with hip-hop's
popularity--is an issue he fails to address in the book. Kennedy
prefers to focus his analysis of more contemporary culture on the
black-speaker-to-a-black-studio- audience construct of Def Comedy Jam
(where he approves of the word as well), though he mentions that
rapper Eminem refuses to include the word in the rhymes he performs.
(He doesn't mention that the white rapper uses it liberally when
writing for his black cohort Dr. Dre.)</TE>
<TE>   His conclusion is that "there is much to be gained by allowing
people of all backgrounds to yank 'nigger' away from white
supremacists, to subvert its ugliest denotation and to convert the
N-word from a negative into a positive appellation," a position that,
for all its controversy, boasts many supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "I, for one, use it quite liberally," says George. To him,
Kennedy's argument is one that stands on its own, he says, and  an
in-depth analysis of youth culture isn't needed to make the case for
its current contextualization.</TE>
<TE>   But for Tricia Rose, author of "Black Noise" and a professor at
New York University, the current cultural framework is key. "I 100%
agree with Kennedy that the word has to be contextualized," she says.
"But we have to take into account the context of American society
when we rewrite this word for the purpose of endearment. And that's
why the absence of a discussion of hip-hop is exceptionally
troubling, because it's used with more extraordinary repetition in
hip-hop than any other cultural form that is mass-produced in the
history of America popular culture."</TE>
<TE>   Just because the word is accepted by some as a term of endearment,
Rose says, "doesn't mean the context around it has shifted.
Exploitation is simply not gone, by any stretch of the imagination."
Rose says this isn't just the case in discussing hip-hop culture and
its marketing, but also in the title of Kennedy's book. "The industry
is cashing in on the volatility of this word, in the repressed white
anxiety of the word. The marketing of the book is expressing
precisely what I'm articulating here. It's relying on deep white
anxiety and not necessarily a deep interest in self-reflection."</TE>
<TE>   Stanley Crouch, a columnist for the New York Daily News and the
author of "The All-American Skin Game, or, the Decoy of Race," says
he finds the book interesting. He deems it the product of an
exploitative machine, one that will go straight into the hands of
white readers, who, he says, are bent out of shape because their
children are listening to rap.</TE>
<TE>   "'Nigger' has become the new guitar turned up to 10 for suburban
white kids who want to outrage their parents, and that's why people
are talking about this," he says. "The question is, are [blacks] once
again being exploited for a ritual that has nothing to do with you?
Obviously yes." And while Crouch lauds Kennedy for writing what he
calls a "serious book," he dismisses Kennedy's argument that the word
means different things to different people in different contexts.
Says Crouch, "Nigg-a, nigg-er, whatever, it all constantly reaffirms
one thing, that 'you are inferior to us.'"</TE>
<TE>   Opposition is exactly what Kennedy is expecting, from readers of
any demographic. Months before the book's release he was already
collecting outraged letters that poured into his Harvard e-mail
account--just what he'd hoped for.</TE>
<TE>   "All you can do is have your say and hopefully say something
interesting so that people will write back and carry on a
conversation, and this will be a conversation I'll carry on as long
as I'm alive," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy has certainly found success in prying open the door to
heady debate in the larger culture. And with the publication of
Boyd's upcoming book, and the filming of George's documentary, this
conversation will be a public as well as a private one. Gregory, for
one, plans to travel to Harvard to congratulate Kennedy for the book,
as well as to lambaste him for his continuing use of "the N-word" in
conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Rose is eager to take Kennedy up on his invitation for dialogue,
which, it seems, has only just begun. "The responsibility is ours. No
book can answer all these questions. As intellectuals, writers,
readers and just plain people who live in this culture, the burden is
on us."</TE>
<TE>   "Bring it on," says Kennedy. "That's what I want. Anytime,
anywhere. You want a conversation? Send me your phone number, and
I'll call you. Send me your e-mail, and I'll write you. Just bring it
on."</TE>

<HD>Don't Equate Bra Size With Feminine Beauty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I'd like to know what styles of clothes you'd
recommend for women who are flat-chested. It's very difficult for us
women to look feminine and beautiful in many of the styles that are
in fashion. I've tried wearing padded bras, water bras and gel bras,
but the design and under-wire construction aggravates the fibrocystic
breast disease I suffer with.</LD>
<LD>   I realize clothing can't make me look like Dolly Parton, but I'd
like to leave my house feeling pretty and confident. Any advice would
be very helpful.</LD>
<LD>   --FLAT OUT DISAPPOINTED</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dear Flat: May we ask you a question? Why are you letting a bra
size determine whether or not you feel pretty and confident? Is that
what happiness comes down to, a 36-D?</TE>
<TE>   Two things we won't argue with is that this is a breast-obsessed
culture, and we all want what we don't have. So we don't fault you
for wanting bigger-looking breasts, but we do take issue with the
fact that you equate them with femininity and beauty. There are
plenty of small-busted women who look and feel plenty feminine and
beautiful, and we're sure there are lots of large-busted women who
don't. Beauty and femininity happen between your ears, not on your
chest.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that you've been willing to endure pain to achieve a look
that's trendy also disturbs us. True, women put up with a lot trying
to achieve an ideal: high heels, control-top pantyhose, push-up bras,
and, in the old days, corsets and girdles. And while it's a woman's
choice to do it or not, at some point she has to decide whether that
choice is the right one. If one's health enters into the picture, the
choice should be clear.</TE>
<TE>   We've always thought that small-busted women have had a distinct
advantage when it comes to clothes, since buttons don't gap and
jackets don't strain. If you want to wear something low cut, you
don't have to have cleavage galore in order to pull it off. A
beautiful woman should be judged by the whole picture--her attitude,
how she carries herself, how she treats others. Clothes and looks
come second.</TE>
<TE>   So our advice is wear whatever you want and forget the fact that
you're not a bodacious, busty babe. You're still bodacious and a
babe.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: We are three working women who like to shop
and lunch on the weekends. We'd love to find someplace where they
have a fashion show and combine all our favorite things. I know that
sometimes department stores have small events in the middle of the
store, but is there someplace we can go that is just a little bit
nicer?</TE>
<TE>   --LADY WHO LUNCHES</TE>
<TE>   (ON WEEKENDS)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dear Lady: Those days of hat-wearing ladies lunching while
watching models slither by in the latest from Paris and New York are
pretty much gone, thanks to our ever-changing culture. But that
doesn't mean the fashion show is an endangered species; you just have
to look a little harder for them and be more creative in your
approach to the show/lunch/ shopping triumvirate.</TE>
<TE>   First, check with the most expensive, exclusive department store
in your area that has a restaurant. Some may still feature strolling
models while you dine.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, for non-fashion industry insiders, gaining access to a
really great fashion show takes some work. First of all, forget about
the seasonal collections shown in New York--those are for press and
buyers only. However, many charitable organizations often have lavish
fashion shows in grand hotels that you can attend if tickets are
available to the public (some are by invitation only). Ticket prices
vary depending on the charity and the show but will range from about
$50 to $1,000. Check newspapers' society pages for news of upcoming
events. Some charity support groups are known for putting on fashion
shows, so if you join you're guaranteed a chance at a seat.</TE>
<TE>   Boutiques sometimes offer trunk shows, which are informal in-store
previews of a new collection with one or two models wearing the
clothes. While these don't have the splash of a big runway production
they're relaxed and fun, and you have the luxury of seeing the
clothes up close and personal--and you can shop. If you have a
favorite specialty store, ask the owner to keep you informed of
upcoming shows.</TE>
<TE>   If all else fails, become chummy with a fashion bigwig, and you
could get yourself invited to all the important fashion shows free.</TE>

<HD>The Political Snub  Can Rub Both Ways</HD>
<DH>Slighting a foe or a friend--as Burton did Davis--is rare
in the business of politics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES CULTURE CORRESPONDENT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American politics  was a rough business from the start.</LD>
<LD>   But it's surprisingly rare to see political snubs of the sort
State Senate President John Burton delivered to a fellow Democrat
this week, when he skipped all but five minutes of Gov. Gray Davis'
State of the State address, offering the excuse that he had been
delayed by "traffic and fog."</LD>
<LD>   Such slights are unusual in this country because the business of
politics is very much a business, and it depends on relationships.
With our divided government and weak party discipline, political
success rests on the ability to wheel and deal across partisan lines.</LD>
<TE>   And the dissed seldom deal.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, parliamentary democracies have rich histories of
delicious insults and slights, the fruits of their regular
confrontational debates and rigidly enforced party discipline.</TE>
<TE>   Winston Churchill, for example, famously referred to Clement
Attlee, leader of the Labor Party, as "a sheep in sheep's clothing"
and dismissed a persistent parliamentary antagonist as "a squalid
nuisance."</TE>
<TE>   Two hundred years before Churchill, during the debate on the
failure of the South Seas Co.--the Enron of its day--an acerbic MP
summed up his view of the Earl of Oxford, the firm's head: "He melded
cunning with mediocrity."</TE>
<TE>   Britain was on the receiving end of one of the 20th century's most
memorable political put-downs. It occurred in 1921, when the
insurgent and statesman Michael Collins accepted the British handover
of Dublin Castle on behalf of the provisional government of the newly
established Irish Free State. At the appointed hour, the entire
imperial establishment--civil and military--was drawn up in formation
on the castle's parade ground.</TE>
<TE>   Collins deliberately kept all of them waiting.</TE>
<TE>   When he finally arrived and dismounted from his touring car, Lord
FitzAlan, the British viceroy, hissed, "You're seven minutes late,
Mr. Collins."</TE>
<TE>   "We've been waiting 700 years," Collins snapped back. "You can
have the seven minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Such moments and phrases are rarer in American political history,
which is, in fact, replete with examples of snubs and slights that
backfired on their perpetrators. In 1916, for example, the GOP's
presidential candidate, Charles Evans Hughes, made a campaign stop in
L.A. but declined to make a courtesy phone call to the state's
Republican governor, Hiram Johnson, because he disapproved of the
Californian's enthusiasm for progressive reforms.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Johnson announced that he was supporting the
Democrat, Woodrow Wilson, who carried California and won the
presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   Former Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty built a reputation for
boorishness and bigotry with his racially tinged slights of the man
who defeated him, Tom Bradley. Throughout their two electoral
contests, Yorty refused to refer to his African American opponent by
the honorific titles that reflected his service as a City Council
member and an LAPD command officer. Yorty, in fact, refused even to
use the word "Mister," habitually calling the challenger simply
"Bradley."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly graceless in defeat,  Yorty left for an Alaskan cruise
rather than attend Bradley's inauguration as tradition dictated. The
two men never spoke again. Actually, there were those who felt
Bradley had fared better than many of Yorty's opponents, whom he
usually attacked as communists.</TE>
<TE>   During a luncheon at The Times some years later, former Gov.
Edmund G. (Pat) Brown recalled Yorty's history as a red-baiter and
described him as "the cleverest concocter of phony issues I ever
knew."</TE>
<TE>   Coming from a man who ran against Richard Nixon, that means
something.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes a political snub can cut both ways.</TE>
<TE>   In October  1995, for example, then-Speaker of the House Newt
Gingrich (R-Ga.) was relegated to a back seat on Air Force One when
he accompanied President Clinton to the funeral of the assassinated
Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin. Gingrich's loud public
complaints about the slight led many to characterize him as a
crybaby, thereby undermining his status. Memories of the incident,
however, helped fuel conservative Republican animosity toward
Clinton, which helped pave the way for--oh, never mind.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, on Feb. 21, then-GOP presidential hopeful Sen. John
McCain of Arizona told a campaign rally in Virginia Beach, Va., that
conservative Christian ministers Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell were
"agents of intolerance, comparable to Louis Farrakhan and Al Sharpton
on the left." Those remarks helped solidify McCain's national
reputation for candor and independence--and are thought by many
political analysts to have cost him the South Carolina primary.</TE>
<TE>   But the right snub by the right politician at the right time can
have an unambiguously devastating effect. Take, for example, the
stunning 1948 exchange between President Harry S. Truman and Jimmy
Roosevelt, son of the late Franklin D. Roosevelt and an aspiring
California politico with a dynastically bright future.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Roosevelt, a Marine Corps veteran and a regular on the
postwar Los Angeles glittering cafe society scene, had been among the
Democrats actively seeking an alternative candidate to Truman, who
nonetheless secured the party's nomination and immediately embarked
on a whistle-stop railway campaign tour.</TE>
<TE>   When he reached L.A., Truman went to the Ambassador Hotel on
Wilshire Boulevard, and the first person in line to see him was Jimmy
Roosevelt.</TE>
<TE>   A trusted presidential aide, Matt Connelly, received Roosevelt and
led him into the presidential suite's sitting room, where, without
preamble, the president strode up to the younger man, put an
outstretched finger in his face and erupted:</TE>
<TE>   "Your father asked me to take this job. I didn't want it; I was
happy in the Senate. But your father asked me to take it, and I took
it. And if your father knew what you are doing to me, he would turn
over in his grave.</TE>
<TE>   "But get this straight: Whether you like it or not, I am going to
be the next president of the United States. That will be all. Good
day."</TE>
<TE>   Truman turned and walked out. Roosevelt left without speaking.</TE>
<TE>   Accounts of the dressing-down spread, and young Jimmy's political
fortunes never recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Most American politicians, however, reflexively avoid such
decisive breaks. Whatever they may really feel about each other, most
keep in mind the elder Joseph Kennedy's shrewd admonition:</TE>
<TE>   In this country, he said, "sooner or later, everyone does business
with everyone."</TE>

<LD>Have you ever been to a national park? With 385 sites, the National
Park System is probably closer to you than you think. Unfortunately,
the national parks are in trouble. Things such as air pollution and
crowding threaten them. But you can help by being a good park
citizen. All you need is to be in SHAPE:</LD>
<LD>   * Safe: Don't feed the animals or leave your campfire burning. And
check the weather so you have the right clothes and gear.</LD>
<LD>   * Healthy: Walk, bike or snowshoe while in a park instead of
driving everywhere or using a snowmobile. Not only will this help
keep you healthy, but it will keep the parks healthy too, because
fewer cars and snowmobiles mean less pollution in and around the
parks.</LD>
<TE>   * Active: Write to your leaders and ask them to be friends to the
parks, or volunteer to help clean a park or mark hiking trails.</TE>
<TE>   * Protective: Take pictures of parks, but don't take natural
souvenirs such as rocks, flowers or shells. Take care not to step on
plants. And do not bring seeds like peach pits or apple cores into
the park, or release pets like fish or turtles, because this can
affect native plants and animals.</TE>
<TE>   * Educated: Learn about our nation's parks and everything they
protect. You can ask your teacher to use "Parks in the Classroom"
programs from the National Park Service. You can also become a junior
ranger at many parks by participating in learning activities.</TE>
<TE>   Did You Know?</TE>
<TE>   * Visitors to Arizona's Petrified Forest National Park take away
up to 12 tons of petrified wood every year. Taking pieces of the park
home is not only illegal but also destroys the park.</TE>
<TE>   * California has 24 national park sites--the most of any state.</TE>
<TE>   * About 89,000 people across the country volunteered in national
parks last year.</TE>
<TE>   Learn More</TE>
<TE>   * Read "Will We Miss Them?: Endangered Species" by Alexandra
Wright, illustrated by Marshall Peck.</TE>
<TE>   * Visit www.eparks.org/nationalparks for a list of all 385
National Park sites.</TE>
<TE>   * Ask your parents to take you to a nearby national park.</TE>

<HD>'Can't' Is the Worst Word Ever</HD>
<DH>Part 5: The story so far: Emily has met Jenna, a person who
has wheels on her chair.</DH>
<SE>Part 5</SE>
<AU>CHERIE TROPED</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Jenna said she was a person who has wheels on her chair, she
made it sound like the coolest thing in the world. "But it's hard," I
said, "wanting to do things and not being able to."</LD>
<LD>   "Sure, it's hard," Jenna said. "But there are a lot of things that
I can do that the other kids can't."</LD>
<LD>   Somehow when Jenna said can't, it didn't sound so bad.</LD>
<TE>   "There are sports for kids in wheelchairs," Jenna said. "But I
choose not to do them. I wouldn't do sports even if I weren't in a
wheelchair. I would rather read and make octopus dolls."</TE>
<TE>   "You like to make octopus dolls? I love to make octopus dolls!"</TE>
<TE>   So we made plans. After school Jenna came to my house, and we made
octopus dolls. We had the best time! We ate cookies and drank
lemonade. And I told Jenna that I think I was always missing
something I thought I wanted. But maybe now I've changed my mind.</TE>
<TE>   I know now that not everyone can do everything. Some of us are
better at writing. And some of us can run faster. But there are
always kids like me and like Jenna who love to read and draw and do
quiet stuff. And that's OK!</TE>
<TE>   I just have to remember that.</TE>
<TE>   Callie came over to make octopus dolls the other day, and she was
kind of messing them up. "I can't do this!" she said.</TE>
<TE>   I told her that "can't" is not a word I use.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out that Jenna and I have a lot in common.</TE>
<TE>   She has a cat like me. But she has a bird instead of a little
brother. I think a bird is better than a little brother, but what can
you do?</TE>
<TE>   Of course she likes to read.</TE>
<TE>   And she doesn't like the word "can't," either.</TE>
<TE>   Now when we hang out together, after school--we never ever use
that word!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cherie Troped says she doesn't like the word "can't" either! This
story will be on The Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids. A new,
five-part story begins on Monday.</TE>

<HD>A. Prokhorov, 85; Physicist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Alexander Prokhorov, who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964
for work that led to development of the laser, has died. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Prokhorov, whose work helped lay the groundwork for compact discs,
modern surgery and other scientific advances, died of pneumonia in
his Moscow apartment Tuesday, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.</LD>
<LD>   Known for his strong will and fiercely independent mind, Prokhorov
shared the Nobel Prize with countryman Nikolai Basov and U.S.
scientist Charles Townes.</LD>
<TE>   "Many believed that we had gone crazy, that it was impossible," he
said in November 2001 archive footage shown on RTR state television.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very brave step, because before that no one had said it
was possible to create a generator of optical range. Then it became a
new, independent science--optics."</TE>
<TE>   The research institute Prokhorov headed was also a key contributor
to the Soviet program to counter President Ronald Reagan's plans for
a space-based defense system, which became popularly known as "Star
Wars."</TE>
<TE>   But Prokhorov was anything but a conformist in an era when
diversions from the accepted political line were rare.</TE>
<TE>   After being appointed editor in 1969 of the Great Soviet
Encyclopedia, the Soviet Union's prime reference work, Prokhorov
ignored orders to exclude dissident Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov
from the volume.</TE>
<TE>   He also refused a government invitation to become a deputy in the
Soviet parliament.</TE>
<TE>   "I said I do not want to be a deputy, because I am not a
politician. I am a scientist," Prokhorov said in the archive footage
marking his 85th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Prokhorov's passing marked the end of an era for
Russian science.</TE>
<TE>   "His name is linked to outstanding discoveries that in many ways
defined 20th century civilization," President Vladimir V. Putin said.</TE>
<TE>   The scientist had no computer, complaining that it would
"interfere with his thinking," and preferred to make notes on scraps
of paper, hundreds of which still litter his office.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Atherton, Australia, in 1916, Prokhorov came to the Soviet
Union in 1923 with his family, opponents of the czar.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Leningrad State University in 1939,
Prokhorov joined the Red Army, despite eligibility for exemption
because of his academic research. He was wounded twice during World
War II and was discharged as a disabled veteran in 1944.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he joined the P.N. Lebedev Physical Institute in
Moscow as a senior associate. He completed his doctorate in 1951 and
in 1954 was named head of the institute. It was there that he and
Basov produced a maser, a beam of coherent microwave radiation
analogous to a laser, in 1954. Their work came a year after Townes
had developed the first maser. Basov died last year at the age of 76.</TE>
<TE>   A leading member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Prokhorov was
twice made a Hero of Socialist Labor--the former Soviet state's
highest civilian award.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, Prokhorov joined 96 other Nobel Prize winners from around
the world in calling for a freeze on development and deployment of
nuclear weapons.</TE>

<HD>W.A. Criswell, 92; Leader of Literal-Bible Movement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rev. W.A. Criswell, whose decades-long impassioned defense of a
literal interpretation of the Bible led to the Southern Baptists'
return to their conservative roots, died Thursday. He was 92 and had
been in failing health for more than a year battling cancer.</LD>
<LD>   The pastor for 50 years at the influential First Baptist Church of
Dallas, Wallie Amos Criswell is credited with launching a
conservative reformation among evangelical Christians in the late
20th century. He did so by preaching that the Bible is the exact,
unerring word of God and historically accurate.</LD>
<LD>   "He was a redneck preacher with a scholar's head," said Paige
Patterson, president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in
Wake Forest, N.C. "That's a rough combination" for theological
opponents to battle.</LD>
<TE>   The charismatic preacher with advanced degrees in theology and
philosophy served twice as president (1968-69) of the Southern
Baptist Convention, which represents 15.6 million congregants. He
wrote 54 books (including "Why I Preach the Bible Is Literally True")
and founded 400-student Criswell College, four Christian radio
stations and a 700-bed homeless shelter.</TE>
<TE>   "His devotion to Scripture inspired thousands of young clergy from
many denominations," said the Rev. Billy Graham in a written
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Graham, a member of the First Baptist Church, considered Criswell
his pastor. "His preaching was electric in its power," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the pulpit, his voice could go from a whisper to a bellow
during the length of a sentence.</TE>
<TE>   He often told friends that "on a clear day, you can hear me five
miles away." He always spoke without notes but with a Bible in one
hand.</TE>
<TE>   One New Year's Eve, Criswell preached for 4 1/2 hours on "The
Scarlet Thread Through the Bible," showing congregants that the
sacrifice of Jesus can be seen in very biblical verse. The service
spilled over into the new year.</TE>
<TE>   His sermons from 1957 to 1977 can be found on the Internet at
www.awcriswell.com.</TE>
<TE>   His delivery, with his white suits and hair, was so distinctive
that many congregants--and local comedians--could do spot-on
impersonations, which the pastor enjoyed.</TE>
<TE>   He gave one of his most influential messages in 1985 when the
annual Southern Baptist Convention came to his adopted hometown of
Dallas. About 35,000 faithful heard Criswell's sermon "Whether We
Live or Whether We Die," which helped solidify conservative control
over the organization.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very famous sermon," Patterson said. "Dallas was very,
very pivotal." The moderates made every conceivable effort "to regain
control. But they came up empty."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to Criswell's influence, over the last decade professors at
the six Southern Baptist seminaries have taught only the literal
interpretation of the Bible, resulting in thousands of pastors now
trained in conservative theology.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern Baptists also flexed their conservative muscle during
the last decade by supporting a boycott of Disney, criticizing some
of its films and its practice of offering benefits to same-sex
partners of employees. The Baptists also called for women to submit
graciously to their husbands, and held conventions in the heart of
other religious communities, such as Salt Lake City, the Mormon
capital.</TE>
<TE>   The push back toward conservatism earned Criswell enemies among
moderates and liberals.</TE>
<TE>   "If confrontation and revolution came without hurt, that would be
great," Patterson said. "But unfortunately, life doesn't happen that
way."</TE>
<TE>   Patterson said Criswell was seen by many as a tremendous threat to
liberal theology.</TE>
<TE>   "There were people who realized, from their viewpoint, what a
dangerous man he was ... almost swashbuckling," he said. But
opponents found it "hard to keep on hating him" because he was so
personally endearing.</TE>
<TE>   Graham said, "He had one of the most loving hearts I have ever
known."</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1909, Criswell was raised in Texline, Texas, where his
father was a barber. After a revival service at age 10, he gave his
first sermon to neighborhood children during a funeral service for
his pet dog.</TE>
<TE>   He received his undergraduate degree from Baylor University and
his master's in theology and doctorate in philosophy at Southern
Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   After pastoral stops in Kentucky and Chickasaw and Muskogee,
Okla., Criswell, at 34, was the surprise pick to take over the pulpit
at the First Baptist Church of Dallas in 1944. For the next 50 years,
he presided over the downtown congregation, which grew from 6,000 to
a peak of 28,000. Criswell has served as the church's pastor emeritus
since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   He also popularized the nearly extinct, verse-by-verse preaching
of the Bible, once taking 17 years of Sunday sermons to get through
the entire Bible.</TE>
<TE>   "He almost single-handedly reintroduced that style of preaching,"
said Ron Harris, executive president of Criswell Communications,
which runs four radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   Criswell is survived by his wife, Betty; daughter, Mabel Ann; and
grandsons Cris Criswell and Paul Daniel Jackson. Services will be
Wednesday at the First Baptist Church of Dallas.</TE>

<HD>Isabel Garcia Lorca, 91; Poet's Sister</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Isabel Garcia Lorca, who spent much of her life guarding the legacy
of her late brother Federico, one of Spain's greatest 20th century
literary figures, died Wednesday at her home in Madrid. She was 91.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of death was not disclosed, but a family member told the
national news agency Efe that she had been suffering from respiratory
difficulties since shortly after New Year's.</LD>
<LD>   Garcia Lorca created and directed the government-approved
foundation that preserves her brother's name and the family home, as
well as an extensive archive of his manuscripts, letters, photographs
and drawings.</LD>
<TE>   Federico was executed during the Spanish Civil War by fascists
loyal to Gen. Francisco Franco. He was 38 and already internationally
acclaimed for his poems and plays, including "Blood Wedding" and "The
House of Bernarda Alba."</TE>
<TE>   Isabel grew up with Federico and two other siblings in the
southern city of Granada in the early 1900s, a period of renaissance
for Spanish culture. She moved to Madrid in the 1930s to attend the
university, earned a degree in philosophy and started teaching. But
after Federico was assassinated in 1936, she fled to Belgium.</TE>
<TE>   She ended up in the United States, where she taught Spanish
language and literature in the 1950s at Hunter College and Wellesley
College. She returned to Spain in the 1970s after the restoration of
democracy.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, she created the Garcia Lorca Foundation and served as its
president. She was her brother's last surviving sibling.</TE>

<HD>Leo Seren, 83; Physicist on the Atomic Bomb Who Turned
Pacifist</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leo Seren, 83, a University of Chicago physicist who called himself a
war criminal for the role he played in the development of the atomic
bomb, died of amyloidosis Jan. 3 at a hospital in Evanston, Ill.</LD>
<LD>   Seren had just earned his doctorate from the University of Chicago
when he went to work with Enrico Fermi on the Manhattan Project in
1942. Seren was one of 51 people present in an abandoned squash court
at the university's Stagg Field on Dec. 2, 1942, when the first
nuclear reactor achieved critical mass. Seren's job was to measure
the density of neutrons in piles of graphite, uranium and cadmium
control rods used to build the reactor.</LD>
<LD>   He worked on nuclear power until 1960, stopping when he reached
the conclusion that there was no way to safely dispose of radioactive
waste. He began to focus on renewable energy sources, such as solar,
wind and water power. He also joined the peace movement and belonged
to a Chicago-based group, now defunct, called NOMOR, an acronym for
Nuclear Overkill Moratorium.</LD>
<TE>   In a 1982 speech before anti-nuclear demonstrators at the
University of Chicago, Seren spoke of his regret over his role in the
Manhattan Project, which led to the devastation of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, Japan, in 1945 and the loss of tens of thousands of lives.
He said that if he were tried for crimes against humanity, "I'd plead
guilty. And I'd say for mitigating circumstances that at least I
decided that I'd never work on nuclear weapons again."</TE>

<LD>Gary LaFontaine, 56, a renowned fly fisherman whose devotion to the
sport made him a popular author, publisher and speaker, died of
complications from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's
disease, on Jan. 4 in Deer Lodge, Mont.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Hartford, Conn., who graduated from the University of
Montana, LaFontaine turned his passion into a business that made him
a celebrity in the fly-fishing world.</LD>
<LD>   His five books, including "Challenge of the Trout" and "Trout
Flies: Proven Patterns," are considered classics about the sport. He
wrote magazine articles, produced a newsletter-catalog, gave
slide-show presentations across the country and appeared in
fly-fishing videos.</LD>
<TE>   He also spent untold hours on and under the water observing insect
activity and trout behavior, knowledge he used to invent ingeniously
effective fly patterns.</TE>
<TE>   But most of all, he fly-fished 150 to 200 days a year until his
disease was diagnosed three years ago and eventually rendered him
unable to fish.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dame Sheila Sherlock, 83, a leading authority on liver disease who
established study of the liver as a distinct discipline, died of
undisclosed causes Dec. 30 at her home in London.</LD>
<LD>   Sherlock studied medicine at Edinburgh University and graduated at
the top of her class in 1941. In 1951, at age 33, she became the
youngest woman elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.</LD>
<LD>   In 1959, she was the first woman appointed to the chair of a
British department of medicine, assuming the newly created post at
the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine in London. The liver unit
she established there attracted researchers from around the world as
her pioneering work gained recognition.</LD>
<TE>   Sherlock was the author of "Diseases of the Liver and Biliary
System." Published in 1955, it is still regarded as a standard text
in the field and has been translated into a least six languages.</TE>
<TE>   Sherlock, who received dozens of academic honors, was made a
dame--the equivalent of a knight--in 1978. Last year, she became a
fellow of the Royal Society, a top honor for medical scientists in
Britain.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Glayde Whitney, 62, a Florida State University psychology professor
who generated controversy by writing that blacks by nature are
generally less intelligent than whites, died of natural causes
Wednesday in Tallahassee, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   A researcher of genetic mechanisms underlying behavior, Whitney
wrote the foreword to former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke's 1999
book "My Awakening." Calling Duke a "seeker of truth," Whitney said
blacks on average have lower intelligence and more natural
aggression.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike environmental psychologists, who believe that intelligence
has more to do with living conditions than race, Whitney contended
that most blacks are destined to fail and that science proves it.</LD>
<TE>   The Tallahassee branch of the National Assn. for the Advancement
of Colored People urged that Whitney be fired, but university
officials took no action against the tenured professor. University
President Talbot Sandy D'Alemberte called Whitney's opinion on race
obnoxious and wrong but defended his right to express it.</TE>

<HD>Al Smith, 73; Got Doused in Series</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Al Smith, a major league outfielder whose accomplishments on the
field were overshadowed when he was on the wrong end of a spilled
beer during the 1959 World Series, has died. He was 73.</LD>
<LD>   Smith died Jan. 3 of cardiac arrest at a hospital in Hammond,
Ind., after undergoing arterial surgery.</LD>
<LD>   The left fielder for the American League champion White Sox, Smith
was doused with beer during the fifth inning of the second game of
the series against the Dodgers. Dodger second baseman Charlie Neal
had hit a line drive home run to left field at old Comiskey Park in
Chicago that had forced Smith back to the wall. In an instant, a cup
of beer toppled out of the stands and landed on Smith's head.</LD>
<TE>   "It hit the bill of my cap and came down the side of my face,"
Smith later recalled. "It was in my nose and everywhere. At first, I
thought the guy dumped it on purpose, but the umpire told me that he
just tipped it over trying to get the ball."</TE>
<TE>   (Neal hit another homer later in the game, and the Dodgers went on
to win the game and the series. It was their first world championship
after moving to Los Angeles.)</TE>
<TE>   The image of Smith and the errant beer was immortalized by Ray
Gora, a photographer for the Chicago Tribune. Working from a spot
near third base and using what was then a fairly innovative camera
with a rapid shutter and a 70-millimeter lens, Gora took an
eight-frame series of photographs, which included Neal's home run and
the beer episode. The frame showing Smith covered with beer was
widely reproduced over the years.</TE>
<TE>   The incident seemed to overshadow Smith's impressive career. Twice
selected to the American League All-Star team, he finished second in
hitting in 1960 with a .315 average. He also played for two American
League champion teams.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Kirkwood, Mo., Smith was a star athlete in high school,
playing football and baseball, as well as boxing. He turned down
college football scholarship offers, instead playing with the
Cleveland Buckeyes of the Negro League, and he competed in the Negro
League World Series against the New York Cuban Giants.</TE>
<TE>   He was signed to a minor league contract by the Cleveland Indians
in 1948 after leading the Negro League in batting in 1947. Smith
spent several seasons in the minors before joining the
pennant-winning Indians club of 1954. He was later traded to the
White Sox for outfielder Minnie Minoso.</TE>
<TE>   Replacing the popular Minoso in Chicago proved difficult for
Smith, who earned a steady chorus of boos his first season. But he
rose to the occasion and made key hits in the White Sox pennant
drive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame: People all remember Al for the beer thing in 1959,
but he was a good ballplayer besides," Billy Pierce, a White Sox
teammate of Smith, told the Chicago Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a good clutch hitter and outfielder," Pierce added. "His
reputation seemed to hinge on the photo. Every time you were with Al,
someone would bring it up. Al didn't seem to mind it at all."</TE>
<TE>   Smith later played for the Baltimore Orioles, returned to the
Indians and then went to the Boston Red Sox. He hit .272 over his
career, with 164 home runs.</TE>
<TE>   After his retirement, Smith worked for the parks department in
Chicago, teaching baseball and later as a community relations
representative for the White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Mildred; two sons and two daughters; a
brother; three sisters; and 11 grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Today There's an Expert for Any Occasion</HD>
<DH>Knowledgeable on topics from horses to handguns, witnesses
'can make or break a case.' Critics assail flaws.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once dominated by doctors and science professors, the world of expert
witnesses is branching out to topics ranging from artifacts to
aquatics, forklifts to forestry.</LD>
<LD>   In the last six years, the number of categories of experts in a
national directory of witnesses has doubled to more than 400. And
although the Y2K category is no longer included in the Northern
California-based advertising directory, next year's edition will
boast a timely new heading: domestic terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Legal newspapers and magazines are also sprinkled with ads from
court experts, such as "One of a Kind Bicycling Expert" and "Scalding
Expert: Millions in Settlements, Judgments and Savings." An accident
investigation and reconstruction expert bills himself as "Mr. Truck."</LD>
<TE>   Expert witnesses are a key ingredient of most trials; they serve
as authorities who bolster the arguments of attorneys and translate
technical evidence for jurors. They testify in cases stemming from
skiing accidents, claims of medical malpractice and the alleged abuse
of circus animals.</TE>
<TE>   "The good ones are really good investigators; they're detectives,
and they can really make or break a case," said Stephen Bernard,
partner at a West Los Angeles law firm that handles catastrophic
injury cases.</TE>
<TE>   Former Olympic equestrian medalist Kathy Kusner took out her first
advertisement in a legal publication in 1983, and she has been
working as an expert witness on horses ever since.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, she provides attorneys with behind-the-scenes
advice from a "horseman's point of view." In others, she testifies on
whether a rider or a rental stable is to blame for an injury.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether you are an expert for plumbing or electrical or horses,
the attorney doesn't know those things," Kusner said.</TE>
<TE>   "The attorney is an expert at being an attorney, and the judge is
an expert at being a judge. Your job is to educate."</TE>
<TE>   Critics, however, say that the lawyers are allowed to rely too
heavily on experts who are essentially paid advocates.</TE>
<TE>   "For experts, this is a business--no more, no less than selling
hamburgers," said University of Florida professor Jeffrey Harrison,
who has researched the subject. "Though in this case, they can sell
pretty much whatever they want."</TE>
<TE>   Juries often buy arguments based on experts' credentials and
performance, instead of carefully evaluating the testimony they hear,
Harrison said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, many trials turn into battles of the experts, with
the best speakers--rather than the ones who present the most cogent
facts--providing the winning testimony.</TE>
<TE>   "When it gets to trial, it's like putting on a play," Harrison
said. "The better actors you have, the better your play will be."</TE>
<TE>   Arthur H. Patterson, an expert on expert witnesses, said he
instructs them to speak strongly and confidently, make eye contact
with jurors and to inform without sounding patronizing.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time an expert has said to a jury, 'I'm going to make this
simple for you,' the jurors immediately became angry with the expert
because that is an insulting thing to say," said Patterson, a jury
consultant with DecisionQuest.</TE>
<TE>   Experts are quick to defend their reputations, saying that they
can't be bought and that they won't let attorneys stomp on their
integrity or credibility by coercing them to testify a certain way.
Attorneys maintain they are looking for truthful witnesses--not hired
guns.</TE>
<TE>   But lawyers concede that they will put on the stand only experts
who agree with them, and that they can always find an expert who
follows the skeptic's saying: For a reasonable fee, I'll give you
reasonable doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts acknowledge having an agenda when they enter the
courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Bicycle expert Sean Collinsworth said his goal is to defend the
rights of bicyclists. To the retired Los Angeles County sheriff's
deputy, that means making what those rights are clear to both
bicyclists and motorists.</TE>
<TE>   Collinsworth divides his time between testifying on behalf of
injured bicyclists and testifying against bicyclists who abuse their
rights, such as a woman in a recent Orange County case who was hit
after darting into traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Expert witnesses are not required to have specific qualifications
before taking the stand. The California jury instructions simply say
expert witnesses have "special knowledge, skill, experience, training
or education in a particular subject."</TE>
<TE>   When expert testimony is admitted, judges are required to tell
jurors that "an opinion is only as good as the facts and reasons on
which it is based."</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Superior Court Judge William Pounders, who heads the court's
panel on expert witnesses, said he won't allow an expert to take the
stand if the testimony would hurt jurors' understanding of the case.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court has compiled a list of 85
recommended experts in 37 fields after reviewing their credentials.
Attorneys can refer to the list when choosing a witness, but they are
not limited to those experts.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson said the courts need to take the lead in keeping
charlatans from testifying.</TE>
<TE>   "Jurors can benefit from the education experts can provide," he
said. "But jurors also don't have the ability to know if it's junk
science or not. That's where the courts come in."</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Vale, an expert in forensic dentistry, has been testifying
on bite marks and dental identification for more than 30 years; he
has worked for the prosecution on high-profile murder cases,
including those of O.J. Simpson and Richard Ramirez, the "Night
Stalker."</TE>
<TE>   The toughest part of being an expert witness, Vale said, is having
your credibility attacked by the opposing side's attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   "When you go into court, you are entering the battlefield," said
Vale, co-director of dentistry at County-USC Medical Center, who is
also an attorney. "You never know what to expect. A real brilliant
examiner can really test your mettle."</TE>
<TE>   Bernard, the civil attorney, has relied on expert witnesses in
dozens of cases.</TE>
<TE>   He hired a pathologist to testify that a hospital was at fault
when a woman died during surgery, and he turned to an expert on loss
prevention to testify that a department store had wrongfully
handcuffed a suspected shoplifter.</TE>
<TE>   When Bernard represented a young child who fell from a jungle gym
at school and began having seizures, he said he hired three experts:
a playground specialist, a neuropsychologist and a neurologist. The
case settled in the child's favor, Bernard said.</TE>
<TE>   Expert witnesses drive up the cost of trials, attorneys say,
charging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars to
testify. But experts who develop a reputation are in high demand
whatever the cost, Harrison said.</TE>
<TE>   "Just like a rock group, they are on tour," he said. "They go from
expert witness show to show."</TE>

<HD>Probe of Major Meth Ring Nets 22 in State</HD>
<DH>Crime: Investigation leads to 100-plus arrests nationwide
and seizure of methamphetamine ingredient.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal authorities Thursday announced the arrests of more than 100
people in 12 cities nationwide--including Los Angeles, Fresno and
Riverside--for allegedly smuggling tons of a
methamphetamine-producing chemical from Canada to California.</LD>
<LD>   The arrests and the seizure of enough pseudoephedrine to produce
18,000 pounds of methamphetamine represent a marked expansion in a
three-year investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration and
other law enforcement agencies, including the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police.</LD>
<LD>   "This is an extraordinarily significant step in allowing us to
shut down this hopefully last supply chain for this precursor
chemical for methamphetamine," DEA Administrator Asa Hutchinson said
in Washington, where officials announced the arrests.</LD>
<TE>   The investigation, dubbed Operation Mountain Express, originally
targeted U.S. companies and individuals illegally supplying
methamphetamine producers with pseudoephedrine, used in most
over-the-counter cold medicines.</TE>
<TE>   When those arrests dried up domestic sources of pseudoephedrine,
authorities say, drug traffickers turned to illegal suppliers in
Canada, with the chemical shipped to Chicago and Detroit before being
transported to meth producers in California.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, Hutchinson and other law enforcement officials said,
the federal investigation led to the arrests Thursday of 58 people
and the seizure of 96 automobiles, businesses and homes. Recently,
authorities said, 67 additional people were arrested in connection
with supplying California drug producers with pseudoephedrine from
Canada. Authorities also said they have seized more than $2 million
in cash.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, a federal indictment unsealed Thursday charged 36
people with drug trafficking in Riverside and San Bernardino
counties.</TE>
<TE>   The Inland Empire is "considered to be the methamphetamine capital
of the world," the U.S. attorney's office said in a statement.
Twenty-two defendants live in California, and 16 were in custody as
of Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The 25-count indictment alleges a conspiracy in which the
defendants obtained huge quantities of pseudoephedrine, knowing that
it would be manufactured into methamphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, most of the Los Angeles area defendants would face
mandatory minimum sentences of 10 years in federal prison, and some
could spend life in prison without parole, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's indictment demonstrates that we will work diligently to
cut off new supply routes and to choke off the chemicals that have
made methamphetamine such a scourge in the Inland Empire," said John
S. Gordon, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, U.S. Customs Service Commissioner Robert C. Bonner
said the investigation should significantly curb methamphetamine
trafficking throughout the United States. The huge pseudoephedrine
seizures in this case "prevented thousands of pounds of meth from
being manufactured and sold on the streets of our country," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Though some defendants nationwide are of Middle Eastern descent
and some are in the United States illegally, federal authorities here
and in Washington said their investigation had turned up no
indication that the money used in the drug trafficking operation was
funded by or for terrorist activity.</TE>
<TE>   "As a matter of course, we always look at where the money flows,"
Hutchinson said. "But there is no evidence of any link to terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Other cities where arrests were made by federal agents were
Carlsbad, Cleveland, Houston, Las Vegas, Phoenix and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Since the federal investigation began in 1999 with domestic
supplies of pseudoephedrine, authorities have arrested more than 300
people and seized more than 30 tons of the chemical, as well as $16
million in U.S. currency.</TE>
<TE>   The 16 California defendants already in custody or arrested
Thursday include Carlos Aguayo, 40, of Ontario; Khaled Ahmad, 23, of
Jordan; Stephen Almasri, 41, of Riverside; Amjad Ayeh, 34, of San
Bernardino; Rasheed Aziz, 29, of Israel; and Rudy Barreras, 31,
jailed in Orange County. Ahmad and Aziz are suspected of being
illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Also arrested or in custody are Christian Boyd, 36, and Patrick
Boyd, 35, both of Pinon Hills; Nidal Hamayel, 45, of Moreno Valley;
Mohammad Kahalah, 32, of Highland; Tony Musitef, 50, of Barstow;
Akram Omar, 53, of Lake Elsinore; Alfonso Pelayo, 41, of Huntington
Park; Raheef Sanam, 39, address unknown; Khaled Shoukhah, 38, in
custody in a Los Angeles County jail; and Fernando Valle, 57, in
custody at the Tehachapi prison.</TE>

<HD>Imperial County Seeks State Funds to Patrol Dunes</HD>
<DH>Desert: Officials will ask for $283,000 to help control
off-road riders and growing crowds seeking open spaces.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Confronted with a growing problem of raucous conduct by thousands of
off-road vehicle riders on desert sand dunes, Imperial County
authorities will ask a state commission today to give them $283,000
this year for law enforcement.</LD>
<LD>   The plea for aid from the state's Off Highway Vehicle Commission,
meeting in Ontario, follows a vote this week by the Imperial County
Board of Supervisors to extend a state of emergency in the dunes
between the Imperial Valley and the Colorado River.</LD>
<LD>   Ann K. Capela, the county's chief executive officer, charged
Thursday that the federal Bureau of Land Management, which controls
the dunes, has closed so many desert areas to off-road vehicles in
recent years that crowds upward of 100,000 are overwhelming the open
Imperial County dunes.</LD>
<TE>   Capela suggested that it may be necessary to close those dunes as
well unless much more money is appropriated for law enforcement
there. She said Imperial County funds for that purpose have been
exhausted over the Thanksgiving and New Year's holidays alone.</TE>
<TE>   Over Thanksgiving, an estimated 190,000 people showed up from
California and Arizona urban areas. There was a stabbing, a fatal
shooting, an attack on a ranger, and dozens of clashes that left two
dead and more than 200 injured.</TE>
<TE>   Over New Year's, with a major law enforcement effort by the
Imperial County Sheriff's Department, the California Highway Patrol
and the Bureau of Land Management, it was quieter, but the costs
mounted into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Capela's comments Thursday about closures drew rebuttals from the
supervisor who represents the area, a leading environmentalist and a
member of the state commission. They said that a combination of more
law enforcement and limits on the number of people allowed on major
holidays would control the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Spitler, the state commission member, said it is "pure
supposition, not supported by the facts," to say other closures have
sent hordes of people to the Imperial County dunes.</TE>
<TE>   "People are attracted to the dunes because they think they can go
there and have a lawless experience," the commissioner said. "This
has less to do with off-road recreation and more to do with
party-going, drinking and lawlessness."</TE>
<TE>   The answer, he said, is to set up a no-vacancy system and increase
law enforcement. He noted that the El Centro office of the Bureau of
Land Management is proposing $1.3 million in additional funding for
its management of the area.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel R. Patterson, desert ecologist with the Idyllwild-based
Center for Biological Diversity, said a recent agreement among the
Bureau of Land Management, off-road and environmental groups closed
49,000 acres in the area, but kept 68,000 acres open.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, Patterson said, there remain 500,000 acres of
California desert open to off-road vehicle enthusiasts, and "we are
not moving for any additional closures," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But we've said, set limits," he added. "The BLM needs to know
when to set out the 'No Vacancy' sign."</TE>
<TE>   Wally Leimgruber, Imperial County supervisor from the area, agreed
that the area should be kept open for off-road riders. "But we need
assistance to give us additional law enforcement on about six holiday
weekends a year," he said.</TE>

<HD>Assembly Chooses Wesson as Speaker</HD>
<DH>Legislature: Culver City Democrat is praised by colleagues
in both parties and is elected unanimously.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Herb Wesson was unanimously elected by his colleagues Thursday as the
next speaker of the California Assembly, and he vowed in a stirring
speech to lead the lower house as a team effort, not a personal ego
trip.</LD>
<LD>   Wesson, a 50-year-old Democrat from Culver City, spent two decades
as a political operative to two of Los Angeles' most powerful African
American politicians. He will take over the reins next month from
Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks), who is being forced
out of office this year by term limits.</LD>
<LD>   Fellow lawmakers--Republicans and Democrats alike--praised Wesson
in an emotional series of speeches before the vote, describing him as
the rare politician who listens to others and attempts to truly
understand them.</LD>
<TE>   "He has a unique ability to connect with almost everyone," said
Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento), the only other lawmaker
to make a serious bid for the speakership.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Carl Washington (D-Paramount) recalled how Wesson gave
him his start in politics, when he wandered into the Los Angeles City
Hall office of Councilman Nate Holden as a naive teenager with a
rumpled suit and his hair in Jeri curls.</TE>
<TE>   Later, while working with Wesson for Los Angeles County Supervisor
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, Washington told legislators, the two had to
help broker gang truces. One time, they had to deal with a 300-pound
young man who pounded his fists on the table and boomed, "I want to
fight Mike Tyson!"</TE>
<TE>   Washington said he wanted to walk out, but Wesson pulled him back
in and got the youth some ring training--a sign, Washington said, of
Wesson's patience.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Tony Strickland (R-Moorpark), a conservative who
stands far apart politically from the liberal Wesson, told his
colleagues that Wesson is probably his best friend in the lower
house. When his mother had a stroke, Strickland said, it was Wesson
who first asked him how she was doing, and his mother still asks
about "Little Herbie."</TE>
<TE>   But it was the oratory of Wesson himself that most moved the
lawmakers, and the crowd of family members and political associates
who lined the back of the chamber. Wesson repeatedly told his
colleagues, "Members, the speakership is not about me, it's about
we."</TE>
<TE>   Without citing them by name, he then told the life stories of
colleagues such as Assemblyman Marco Firebaugh (D-Los Angeles), who
was born in Tijuana and pursued an education at UC Berkeley and UCLA
so he could fight for disadvantaged immigrants; and Assemblywoman
Rebecca Cohn (D-Saratoga), who was born poor in Texas to a family
fraught with domestic abuse, only to break the cycle and become an
advocate for battered women.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's been a long road from the rough-and-tumble streets
of Cleveland to this hallowed hall," Wesson said, citing his
childhood in a blue-collar community, where he encountered
discrimination because of the color of his skin.</TE>
<TE>   That racism helped shape Wesson, who says fighting discrimination
is his top priority as a politician. But as he once admitted on the
floor of the Assembly, he has not been immune from prejudices of his
own.</TE>
<TE>   Several colleagues cited the speech Wesson gave in 1999 in support
of a bill to protect gay and lesbian students from discrimination as
a defining moment in his political career.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson confided that even though he had faced ugly prejudice
himself, as a young man he taunted two co-workers whom he and others
presumed to be gay. When one of the men confronted Wesson and asked
him what made the two of them different, Wesson realized his error.
He said he has sought to fight all hatred ever since.</TE>
<TE>   The gay rights bill went down to defeat, but a political star was
born.</TE>
<TE>   He will be sworn into office Feb. 6.</TE>

<HD>10 Guards Hurt After 2 Prison Fights</HD>
<DH>Corrections: Inmates attack officers at drug rehabilitation
center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CORCORAN, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Ten corrections officers went to the hospital after being attacked by
inmates in two separate fights at a maximum-security drug
rehabilitation center in a prison, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   One of the guards suffered an 8-inch cut on his forehead and
another injured his back in the fights Wednesday afternoon, said
Margot Bach, a spokeswoman for the California Department of
Corrections.</LD>
<LD>   The fights involved 25 inmates in a yard at the drug treatment
facility, which is next to Corcoran State Prison south of Fresno.</LD>
<TE>   The first fight, involving nine inmates, may have been planned as
a way to distract officers from an attack on another prisoner, who
was later found with a large cut on his face and neck. Weapons made
by the inmates were found nearby, Bach said.</TE>
<TE>   As the prison staff tried to clear the yard and return the inmates
to their cells, another group of nine inmates attacked some of the
officers, Bach said. Seven others tried to join in the fray, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The officers used pepper spray and gas, and fired wooden or rubber
bullets in an effort to contain the prisoners, she said. The 16
inmates involved in the second brawl were transferred to Salinas
Valley State Prison in Soledad.</TE>
<TE>   The incident came less than a week after three officers were
stabbed in an assault by inmates at the "New Folsom" state prison.</TE>

<LD>Bulldozers began gouging out a lagoon at West Beach on Tuesday to
re-create a water sports playground the city hasn't seen for half a
century. Next month, there will be a water basin for swimmers, paddle
boats and sailing craft.</LD>
<LD>   "We're very excited," said Karen McBride, commodore of the Santa
Barbara Sea Shell Assn., which sponsors sailing programs for
children.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, the dwindling West Beach lagoon has forced child
sailors dangerously close to the large boats and small ships that
crowd harbor channel.</LD>
<TE>   The project calls for $450,000 in bulldozing and dredging to
remove 164,000 cubic yards of drifted sand that for more than 50
years has expanded beach sand between Stearns Wharf and the harbor.</TE>

<LD>A Kern County grand jury indicted Arvin City Councilman Julio Perez
on felony grand theft and other charges related to alleged misuse of
tobacco tax grant funds at a church preschool.</LD>
<LD>   Perez was charged with felony grand theft and two counts of filing
false claims, said Kern County Assistant Dist. Atty. Stephen Tauzer,
who refused to release details.</LD>
<LD>   Perez, pastor at the Church of the Nazarene in Arvin since 1995,
said the investigation stems from allegations that he used tax money
that the church received to provide child-care services to buy an SUV

<DH>Television: Academy leaders say call for vote to overturn
president's removal is unauthorized.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences dismissed a motion at its
monthly board meeting Wednesday that would have prompted a vote on
whether to overturn last month's decision to let go President Jim
Chabin, informing dissident board members that such action wasn't
authorized under the organization's bylaws.</LD>
<LD>   Some board members of the nonprofit group, which presents the
nighttime Emmy Awards, are angry because the academy's 15-member
executive committee, led by elected Chairman Bryce Zabel, removed
Chabin without consulting the board, which consists of 54 governors
from various branches of the television industry.</LD>
<LD>   Academy leaders did agree Wednesday to reexamine the group's
bylaws and "take an overall look" at the relationship between the
executive committee and board, Zabel said. However, academy legal
counsel Dixon Dern told the group that reopening or overturning the
vote was out of order under the existing rules.</LD>
<TE>   Zabel, who was elected in August, would not discuss details of the
meeting, but sources on the board say the discussion lasted more than
three hours and that a handful of governors walked out.</TE>
<TE>   A search committee is being formed to seek a replacement for
Chabin, who had held the academy's top staff position since 1998.
Insiders say morale among the paid staff has suffered since his exit,
with financial officer Herb Jellinek overseeing those duties on an
interim basis.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate action, the academy altered its awards procedure to
make prime-time quiz shows such as ABC's "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire" eligible for nighttime Emmys. Because of a procedural
quirk, such programs were previously relegated to the Daytime Emmys,
which are presented by the New York-based National Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences.</TE>

<HD>Enron Conducts Auction of Its Key Trading Business</HD>
<DH>Energy: Bidders are seeking some or all of the operation,
which once handled 25% of nation's daily transactions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Struggling to stay alive, Enron Corp. conducted an auction Thursday
for control of its core energy trading business and is expected to
reveal the winner today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.</LD>
<LD>   Enron has virtually shut down its once-dominant trading operation
since it filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history Dec. 2, but has
been able to hold on to many of its valuable traders by paying hefty
retention bonuses, even as the company laid off more than 4,000
workers with a payment of $4,500 each.</LD>
<LD>   Enron conducted the auction Thursday with several bidders in the
office of its New York bankruptcy lawyers, Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges.</LD>
<TE>   At least six companies reportedly are trying to buy part of the
trading operation which once handled an estimated 25% of the
wholesale trading of electricity, natural gas and other energy
products in the United States. Enron wants to retain a 49% stake in
the trading business.</TE>
<TE>   Citicorp Inc., a big Enron creditor, has confirmed that it
submitted a bid, and UBS, another large bank, also reportedly is
among the bidders. BP, the London-based oil giant, has said it
submitted a $25-million offer for assets that include the computer
system that runs Enron's trading operation.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have estimated that Enron's trading business could pull
in as much as $1.5 billion, a tiny fraction of its former worth. In
2000, the trading business generated about 90% of Enron's nearly $101
billion in annual revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The Houston-based company is expected to bring the winning offer
to Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York this
morning, although the company said it could request more time from
Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez if necessary. Some creditors have already
asked Gonzalez to delay the decision or place the proceeds in an
escrow account so that the money would be available to repay
creditors. A spokesman for Enron's lawyers said a deal probably would
be announced either in Bankruptcy Court or shortly before this
morning's hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Enron attorney Martin Bienenstock told Bloomberg News Service that
at least six companies were working on bids.</TE>
<TE>   "Every bidder has a different offer and some proposals are more
complete than others," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its woes, Enron struggled to maintain its trading
business, which processed an estimated $2 billion in transactions a
day. But since early December, Enron has not run its electronic
operation, EnronOnline. Instead, customers were directed to conduct
trading over the telephone.</TE>
<TE>   Competitors have reported an increase in business since Enron's
troubles began.</TE>
<TE>   Enron shares fell 12 cents to 67 cents on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>GM Expects to Beat Earnings Forecasts</HD>

<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp. said Thursday it is targeting earnings this year
above Wall Street consensus forecasts, as money-losing rival Ford
Motor Co. prepares to unveil deep cuts in jobs and production.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit-based GM, the world's largest auto maker, said it expects
to exceed analyst forecasts thanks to expected market-share gains
around the world and continued cost-cutting, including job cuts in
North America and Europe.</LD>
<LD>   "We will drive for market-share growth," GM Vice Chairman Robert
Lutz told Wall Street analysts. "We will pursue growth in share,
while at the same time attempting to maximize profits."</LD>
<TE>   The bullish forecast comes a day before No. 2 auto maker Ford was
expected to unveil a massive restructuring plan including the
shuttering of some North American vehicle-assembly plants and
thousands of job cuts.</TE>
<TE>   German competitor Daimler Chrysler also expects a rough 2002. Its
shares were hit hard Thursday after the company told Wall Street
analysts Wednesday it will have a "tough job" meeting 2002 earnings
targets, and is still hopeful its Chrysler unit will return to
break-even levels this year.</TE>
<TE>   GM, a few years ago regarded as the laggard among the Big Three
Detroit auto makers, is now the only one expected to post a profit
for full-year 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "They're back in the game," said David Cole, president of the Ann
Arbor, Mich.-based industry consultants Center for Automotive
Research, noting that GM has become a stronger competitor with strong
products and improved quality.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its cost-cutting efforts, GM has said it aims to cut
its North American white-collar work force by about 5,670 jobs, or
about 10%, this year. The auto maker is offering a retirement package
to some salaried employees and will cut jobs through attrition and
reduced numbers of contract workers.</TE>
<TE>   GM said it was targeting earnings of $3 per share for 2002,
excluding its money-losing Hughes Electronics Corp. unit. The
forecast is above an analysts' consensus projection of $1.93,
according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Estimates from 15 Wall
Street analysts range from 50 cents to $3.97 for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   GM shares closed down 17 cents at $50.07 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Suit Against Blockbuster Denied</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blockbuster Inc. Thursday said it scored a key legal victory when a
Los Angeles court denied class-action status to independent video
retailers who allege the Viacom Inc. movie-rental chain made illegal
agreements with movie studios.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling, issued on Wednesday by Los Angeles County Superior
Court Judge Victoria Chaney, follows a similar setback in March for a
group of independent retailers in Texas who sought class
certification against the giant video chain owner.</LD>
<LD>   At the heart of the dispute are agreements made in 1997 and 1998
between Blockbuster and several studios including Walt Disney Co.,
AOL Time Warner Inc. and Sony Corp.'s Columbia TriStar.</LD>
<TE>   Under these pacts, the parties share video rental income, enabling
Blockbuster to purchase larger quantities of movies at discounted
prices and advertise their large quantities of new releases to
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs claimed the arrangements violate antitrust and
price-fixing laws.</TE>
<TE>   The California ruling held that any action would "proceed only as
to the individual claims by the individual plaintiffs," and not as a
class action.</TE>

<HD>Calpine Gets $1-Billion Credit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calpine Corp., a U.S. power-plant developer, won $1 billion in
unsecured credit from lenders, boosting its finances for the third
time since its credit rating was cut to junk a month ago.</LD>
<LD>   The one-year credit line will allow Calpine to borrow $350 million
and provide $1 billion in guaranteed backing from banks, the company
said. Calpine, which has a $400-million credit facility, now has
access to $750 million for borrowing and $1.4 billion in letters of
credit.</LD>
<LD>   Moody's Investors Service had cut Calpine's credit grade, citing a
"significant debt burden." Calpine, which owns or is building power
plants in 29 U.S. states, Canada and Britain, then sold $1 billion in
convertible notes to pay debt. This month, it sold an additional
$200million in notes.</LD>
<TE>   "They now have more liquidity, and that's a good thing," said
Susan Abbott, a managing director at Moody's.</TE>
<TE>   "They still have a lot of debt on their balance sheet, and as long
as that remains as heavy a burden as it is, they will remain on
review for a downgrade."</TE>
<TE>   San Jose-based Calpine has about $13 billion in debt on its
balance sheet, Abbott said. Moody's may reconsider its review after
the company releases fourth-quarter results, she said. The earnings
announcement is scheduled for early next month.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Calpine rose 31 cents to close at $16.05 on the New York
Stock Exchange. They have fallen 48% in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine's 8.5% notes maturing in 2011 fell about half a cent on
the dollar to 89.5 cents from 90 cents on Thursday, traders said. The
debt is yielding 10.3%.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. power producers and traders have moved to improve their
balance sheets after Enron Corp., once the biggest energy trader,
filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2, prompting closer industry
scrutiny by credit-rating agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "Concerns about [Calpine] getting financing and accessing capital
markets should subside," said Catherine Zaharis, portfolio manager of
the Principal Utilities Fund, which owns Calpine shares. "It was
clearly on everyone's mind last month."</TE>
<TE>   Calpine's shares fell 22% in December, partly because of investor
concern about debt and financing new power plants.</TE>
<TE>   The company's credit also is rated junk by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.</TE>

<HD>'Runaway' Productions Petition to Be Withdrawn</HD>
<DH>Hollywood: Action group says it needs more time to document
its claims against Canadian government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A petition asking the federal government to impose countervailing
tariffs on U.S. films produced in Canada with Canadian government
subsidies will be withdrawn today, backers of the effort said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Film and Television Action Committee President Brent Swift said
his group needed more time to produce documentation to support the
petition submitted to the Commerce Department early last month. Swift
said the decision to temporarily withdraw the petition "in no way"
indicated a "weakening of our resolve to level the playing field."</LD>
<LD>   Canadian officials said they were not surprised that the petition
was being withdrawn.</LD>
<TE>   "This confirms what we've been saying from the beginning, that the
footing wasn't very solid to support this action," said Mia Chen, a
spokeswoman for Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs and
International Trade.</TE>
<TE>   The withdrawal of the petition is supported by the Screen Actors
Guild, which has come under fire from other unions for backing a
trade tariff inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Swift says they planned to refile within the next two months. "We
fully support FTAC's decision to temporarily withdraw the petition,"
said SAG spokeswoman Ilyanne Kichaven, who declined to comment
further.</TE>
<TE>   Commerce Department guidelines require that the majority of an
affected industry support a tariff inquiry--a calculation difficult
to determine in the loosely defined entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   The petition alleged that Canada was engaged in unfair trade
practices by illegally enticing U.S. productions with tax credits
that give substantial cost breaks to productions that film in Canada
and use Canadian workers.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed remedy was to fine companies an amount equal to the
subsidies before the film could be released in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The major studios, independent producers and many trade unions
have opposed any such tariffs and called the effort shortsighted and
potentially dangerous for an industry that makes billions of dollars
a year selling American films elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Runaway" production has been estimated to cost $10 billion a year
in lost revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian officials have called that figure inflated and argue that
other factors, including a favorable exchange rate, government
investment in the film industry's infrastructure and diverse locales
have played major roles in Canada's entertainment industry boom.</TE>
<TE>   Legislation to provide tax-based wage incentives that would mimic
those in Canada has been introduced in Congress. The bills would
mimic some tax incentives in place in Canada, providing a 25% wage
tax credit for employers on U.S.-based productions with labor costs
between $200,000 and $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers pushing the bills have warned that a trade tariff
inquiry could derail that effort. This week, Swift said, he asked the
U.S. trade representative to begin negotiating with the Canadians for
a voluntary removal of subsidies. A spokesman for the U.S. Trade
Representative's office said such a request had not been made by
close of business Thursday.</TE>

<HD>KB Home's Earnings Jump 21%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>KB Home, the third-largest U.S. home builder by units sold, said
Thursday that its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings rose a
better-than-expected 21% as low mortgage rates boosted sales.</LD>
<LD>   Net income rose to $88.5 million, or $2.03 a share, for the three
months ended Nov. 30, from $73.4 million, or $2, a year earlier, the
company said. The per-share earnings reflect an increase in shares
outstanding. Revenue rose 17% to $1.45 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-year mortgage rate averaged 1.13 percentage points lower in
the three months than a year earlier, helping push U.S. new-home
sales to a record in 2001, the National Assn. of Realtors reported.
KB's profit report came one day after Lennar Corp., the
second-biggest home builder, said its earnings rose 49% in the same
period.</LD>
<TE>   "Housing held up better than most would have expected in the
aftermath of Sept. 11, and a big part of that was rates being so low
it created a sense of urgency in buyers, a sense that this was a
once-in-a-lifetime chance," said Christopher Winham, a home-building
analyst with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. who rates the stock "market
perform."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles-based KB Home, which changed its name from Kaufman &amp;
Broad Corp. last year, was expected to earn $1.82 a share, according
to a survey of analysts by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   KB Home shares fell 42 cents, or 1.08%, to close at $38.59 on the
New York Stock Exchange. They are up 12% in the last 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   KB's sales rose 10% in the quarter, to 7,814 homes, including
1,320 in France, where its Kaufman &amp; Broad unit is one of the largest
builders.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings reported Thursday by other Southern California companies,
excluding one-time gains or charges unless noted:</TE>
<TE>   * ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., which makes a widely used hepatitis C
drug, said fourth-quarter earnings exceeded 29 cents a share.
Analysts were expecting the Costa Mesa-based company to post earnings
of 31 cents for the period, according to a survey by First Call.</TE>
<TE>   ICN said its results have been aided by the use of its Rebetol
hepatitis C drug with Schering-Plough Corp.'s new Peg-Intron
treatment. Studies have shown that the combination works to stop the
virus in more patients than an older combination treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings for 2002 "will likely exceed" $1.72 a share, ICN Chief
Executive Milan Panic said. The average First Call estimate for 2002
is $1.74.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of ICN were unchanged, closing at $32.96 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   * Printronix Inc., an Irvine manufacturer of computer printers,
reported net income of $560,000, or 9 cents a share, for its fiscal
third quarter ended Dec. 28. In the same period a year ago, the
company lost $395,000, or 6 cents, including restructuring charges of
$866,000. Revenue declined 16% to $34 million.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Printronix rose 13 cents to $9.04 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Investors in Teen's Scheme May Have to Give Up Profits</HD>
<DH>Internet: Legal experts say the SEC in the past has
supported efforts to recapture gains in similar Ponzi schemes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some early speculators in an Orange County teenager's $1-million
Internet sports-betting scheme may have to cough up their gains,
legal experts say.</LD>
<LD>   That's partly because some of Cole A. Bartiromo's "investors"
openly acknowledge that they figured the 17-year-old's plan was
illegal, but hoped to reap a bonanza before the scam collapsed.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, Bartiromo's sports-betting programs, guaranteeing returns
of as much as 2,500% within a few weeks, were such obvious frauds,
some experts said, that no one should be permitted to profit from
them. Criminal charges aren't out of the question either, even for
those who eventually lost money after profiting initially, they said.</LD>
<TE>   "If your investment helps the managers of a scam defraud other
people, then I think you are guilty of aiding and abetting the
fraud," said UCLA criminal law professor David A. Sklansky, a former
federal fraud prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed and settled
civil fraud claims against Bartiromo this week, in some cases has
turned the tables on participants by supporting efforts to recapture
profits reaped by early investors in such Ponzi schemes.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the agency nor federal prosecutors are saying what they
may do in the Bartiromo case, which like typical Ponzi schemes
appeared to pay early investors with funds from later investors. The
initial payouts helped give the program legitimacy.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said the youth reeled in more than $1 million from at
least 1,000 Internet surfers worldwide in November and December,
using a Web site that advertised "risk-free" returns from "safe bets"
on sporting events. In settling with the SEC, Bartiromo agreed to
turn over $900,000 he had transferred to an account at a Costa Rica
casino.</TE>
<TE>   Some of his participants said they comb the Internet in search of
various "investment" deals in which they can jump in early and secure
a fast profit before the programs collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "I honestly don't believe any of these are legitimate when I start
them," Heather Wallace in Fort Riley, Kan., told The Times this week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the reasons these things work. People figure they're
the ones who will make out" provided they get in early enough, said
Malcolm Klein, a USC sociology professor.</TE>
<TE>   Those appointed to recover losses in such schemes aren't
hesitating to go after participants.</TE>
<TE>   R. Todd Nielson, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court trustee in the case of
Santa Barbara money manager Reed Slatkin, said last month that he
will seek to recapture as much as $151 million in phony profits that
some investors received in Slatkin's alleged Ponzi scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the trustee in the 1996 collapse of the Syracuse, N.Y.,
family-owned Bennett Funding Group Inc., one of the biggest Ponzi
schemes in U.S. history, recovered ill-gotten gains from investors in
that $700-million scam.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems you can't root these Ponzi schemes out of the system,"
said Michael J. Missal, the court-appointed receiver in a $50-million
pyramid scheme run as the Better Life Club of America Inc. "There
always seem to be people willing to get involved."</TE>
<TE>   Missal said the SEC supported his efforts to file fraud actions
against Better Life investors who "earned" $50,000 or more each from
their investments in what was purported to be a way to help African
Americans invest.</TE>
<TE>   Missal, a lawyer, had to file lawsuits accusing some investors of
fraud to help recover a total of $3 million. In some cases, investors
in the program began launching their own Ponzi schemes, he said, and
opened themselves up to criminal charges, though none were filed.</TE>
<TE>   Trustees in the Slatkin and Bennett Funding cases have had special
bankruptcy laws they could invoke to recover gains, and Missal said
he benefited from the SEC case against the operator of Better Life
because he didn't have to prove what the agency already had: that the
firm was a fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Reforms in securities law have made it more difficult for
defrauded investors to sue lawyers, accountants and other third
parties, including other investors, experts say. But once the
government takes action, victims have an easier road.</TE>
<TE>   In the Bartiromo case, truly unwitting investors who lost money
could use the fraud allegations in the SEC settlement to get a leg up
in seeking money from other investors as well as from Bartiromo,
experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Should such investors hold legitimate claims, they also could
force the Bartiromo family into Bankruptcy Court and use special laws
there to recover money from participants who profited, said Lynn
LoPucki, a UCLA professor of bankruptcy law.</TE>
<TE>   However, a criminal case against Bartiromo's investors would be
difficult to prove, Missal and other lawyers said. The main obstacle
would be showing that the investors had the intent required to
further a fraudulent scheme--a tougher standard to meet.</TE>

<HD>Nasdaq, S&amp;P Up Slightly on Retail, Jobless Report</HD>
<DH>Stocks: Investors are taking a breather as they await more
profit news. The Dow extends its losing streak.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dow Jones industrial average extended its recent losing streak
Thursday, but other market indexes eked out small gains as investors
considered better-than-expected retail sales and a drop in
unemployment claims that indicated the economy might be turning
around.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said investors are still taking a breather from the
market's strong post-September rally. They also are waiting to see
more fourth-quarter profit reports before making substantial
commitments to stocks, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   "An [economic] recovery is built in, and where are we going to go
from here?" said Gary Dugan, global market strategist for asset
management firm J.P. Morgan Fleming.</LD>
<TE>   "People have got some good profits to take. Unless companies can
conjure up some better [earnings] surprises, people will just sit on
their cash."</TE>
<TE>   Stocks in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index are selling for 22 times
their forecast earnings this year--about the same price-to-earnings
ratio as at the height of the bull market in March 2000, research
firm Thomson Financial/First Call reported.</TE>
<TE>   "Prices certainly have gotten ahead of earnings," said John
Davidson, president and chief executive at PartnerRe Asset
Management.</TE>
<TE>   "The fourth-quarter rally we had late last year and the rebound
from the lows of 2001 were a positive.... But now people are going to
wait to see that earnings come through and the economy turns."</TE>
<TE>   The blue-chip Dow industrials slipped 26.23 points, or 0.3%, to
10,067.86. It was the fifth straight losing session for the Dow,
which has fallen almost 200 points during that span and given up most
of its gains at the start of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index closed up 2.35 points,
or 0.1%, to 2,047.24. The broader S&amp;P 500 inched up 1.41 points, or
0.1%, to 1,156.55.</TE>
<TE>   Winners and losers were even on both Nasdaq and the New York Stock
Exchange. Trading was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street scanned retail sales for clues on the health of
consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic
activity. According to data from 84 retailers compiled by Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, sales at stores open for at least a year rose 2.3%
in December, surpassing the bank's forecast for growth of 1.5%.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that those numbers came through fine underscores that
things aren't as bad as people think they are," said John O'Donoghue,
co-head of listed stock trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. Still,
he said, "there's no real impetus to be taking leaps and bounds to
the upside."</TE>
<TE>   Retailer Gap rallied $1.83 to $16.35 and was the
second-most-active stock on the NYSE after saying sales fell 11% in
December, less than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, edged up 60 cents
to $57. The Dow component said sales rose 8% in December, topping its
forecast.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. labor situation appeared to improve last week, with the
government reporting a bigger-than-expected falloff in jobless
workers applying for state unemployment aid.</TE>
<TE>   The number of workers filing initial jobless claims fell by 56,000
to a seasonally adjusted 395,000 for the week ended Jan. 5 from a
revised 451,000 a week earlier, the Labor Department said.</TE>
<TE>   In other market highlights Thursday:</TE>
<TE>   * Gold prices rose to a three-month high, climbing $3.70 to
$287.10 an ounce in New York trading and pushing toward levels seen
in the month after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Traders labeled
gold's breakout a technical move. But the near-certainty that Newmont
Mining will win the bidding for Normandy Mining, Australia's largest
gold producer, was a supporting factor, analysts said. Newmont rose
30 cents to $19.71.</TE>
<TE>   * Ford Motor slumped $1.02 to $15.29. The company's earnings will
suffer because its ability to cut costs will be limited by contracts
with the United Auto Workers union, investment bank UBS Warburg said.</TE>
<TE>   Ford is expected to announce a massive restructuring plan today
that could include the shuttering of some vehicle assembly plants and
thousands of job cuts.</TE>
<TE>   * Dow Chemical fell $2.94, or nearly 9%, to $31.06, on investor
fears concerning the company's asbestos liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   * Technology stocks, among the biggest beneficiaries of the recent
advance, sagged for a third session. IBM fell $2.35 to $122.14, and
Intel lost 71 cents to $34.65.</TE>
<TE>   * Strong demand for $7 billion in bonds sold by Freddie Mac, the
biggest debt sale by a government-sponsored business, helped push
Treasury yields to one-month lows. Freddie Mac, the second-largest
buyer of U.S. mortgages, sold the 10-year notes at 5.77% as tame
inflation lured investors to the fixed-rate securities.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note slipped to 4.97%
from 5.05% on Wednesday, its first dip below 5% since Dec. 5.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft-Calif. Talks Appear to Have Failed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Renewed settlement talks between Microsoft Corp. and California
class-action lawyers for buyers of Windows software appear to have
failed, reducing the chances that a federal judge will approve an
earlier $1-billion deal to resolve more than 100 private lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   Both sides in the talks said Thursday that they expect mediator
Ken Feinberg to tell U.S. District Judge Frederick Motz as soon as
today that a more generous deal is not in the offing.</LD>
<LD>   They believe Motz will then rule quickly on whether to give
preliminary approval to the earlier plan.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, the Baltimore judge asked Microsoft to negotiate with
San Francisco attorney Eugene Crew, who had been appointed by a
California state court to lead class-action suits on behalf of
consumers who say Microsoft overcharged them in its monopoly over
software.</TE>
<TE>   Crew had been left out of the initial round of talks between
Microsoft and class-action lawyers from other states.</TE>
<TE>   Those talks produced a controversial plan for Microsoft to help
public schools get $1 billion worth of software and machines.</TE>
<TE>   Crew complained that the proposed settlement did nothing for the
victims of Microsoft's misconduct, which had been established by a
federal appeals court considering a separate lawsuit by antitrust
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Crew said U.S. consumers could recover as much as $46 billion at
trial, while the other class-action lawyers estimated they could win
$5 billion to $13 billion.</TE>
<TE>   It is unusual for judges to reject proposed settlements as unfair.
But Motz said at an earlier hearing he was reluctant to impose the
terms on citizens of states such as California, which provide more
recourse for consumers who buy goods through third parties, in this
case computer firms. He then asked Microsoft to bring Crew into the
new talks.</TE>
<TE>   That second round of discussions, which broke off Tuesday, barely
got off the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "I have nothing to report, except to say that no progress was made
and it wasn't for a lack of attempt on our part," Crew said.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler agreed that the two sides remained
far apart.</TE>
<TE>   Motz "just wanted, as a matter of process, to have California be
part of it," Desler said. "I think this satisfied the judge's
request."</TE>
<TE>   Feinberg couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   A resolution of the case would lift one of the two major legal
clouds over Microsoft as it continues to fight nine states in federal
court in Washington.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Switzerland's Roche Holding Ltd. must pay $501 million in damages to
Igen International Inc. in a licensing dispute over blood-testing
technology used in Roche's diagnostic equipment, jurors ruled.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors in federal court in Greenbelt, Md., found that officials of
Roche's diagnostic unit deliberately underpaid royalties on the
technology, used to test bodily fluids for cancer and thyroid
problems.</LD>
<LD>   Although the jury's ruling returns the testing-technology license
to Igen, company officials have agreed not to make Roche officials
stop using the system until all appeals are exhausted.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>American Home Products Corp.'s $3.75-billion settlement of lawsuits
over the withdrawn fen-phen diet drug combination won final approval
after the deadline for filing legal appeals expired, company
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in May approved the
settlement, which includes $1 billion for future medical checkups of
fen-phen users and an additional $2.34 billion to settle individual
suits.</LD>
<LD>   Consumers and health providers had until last week to ask the U.S.
Supreme Court to review the agreement. No requests were filed, AHP
said.</LD>
<TE>   Final approval of the settlement starts a 16-month period in which
a new wave of suits can be filed by fen-phen users who opted out of
the settlement.</TE>

<LD>The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits

<LD>   State unemployment offices received 395,000 first-time

<LD>Mobile phone carrier Sprint PCS said it will launch a high-speed
wireless data service over its nationwide network by this summer,
giving customers fast, always-on connections for e-mail and Internet
access.</LD>
<LD>   The company, one of several carriers ramping up faster mobile
services this year, unveiled details of the launch and showed off
games, photo transmission and MP3 songs going over its new network at
the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive William Esrey said the new wireless service will
offer users peak data speeds up to 144 kilobits per second--about
three times faster than the typical home Internet connection. While
actual speeds will not be that high, Esrey said the improvement will
make it easy for customers to retrieve and send e-mail and
attachments through wireless connections and a laptop, personal
digital assistant or mobile phone.</LD>

<HD>SEC Says $900,000 Not Yet Returned by Teen</HD>
<DH>Investments: Agency says the transfer is underway but
missed the Wednesday deadline.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mission Viejo teenager accused of running an Internet scam still
has not surrendered to authorities $900,000 raised in the operation,
regulators said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In a preliminary settlement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Monday, Cole A. Bartiromo agreed to hand over $900,000
he had deposited in a Costa Rican casino account. The SEC had set a
Wednesday deadline.</LD>
<LD>   "The money is not here, but the transfer process is underway," an
SEC spokesman said Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Bartiromo's attorney could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC declined to say which casino it was dealing with in
arranging the money transfer.</TE>
<TE>   In a Nov. 20 e-mail to the SEC, Bartiromo's sports-betting
program--"Invest Better 2001"--said the operation had had wagering
accounts at two casinos, beton internet.com (a site used by Infinity
Casino) and thebigbook.com (home of the Big Book &amp; Casino), both
based in Costa Rica. But Bartiromo told regulators at the time that
the accounts had been closed.</TE>
<TE>   The two casinos are among numerous offshore casinos that accept
sports wagers via the Internet.</TE>

<HD>CBS President Says He's Eyeing Strategy for UPN</HD>
<DH>Media: Leslie Moonves, who will run both networks, says
it's too early to give specific details of restructuring.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his first news conference since gaining oversight of the UPN
television network, CBS Television President and Chief Executive
Leslie Moonves said Thursday that he has no immediate strategies for
the unprofitable network.</LD>
<LD>   "I only want to say that I literally met with the staff for the
first time on Friday," Moonves told TV critics and reporters in
Pasadena, adding that he was engaged in a fact-finding mission on how
the two networks, both owned by Viacom Inc., would work together.</LD>
<LD>   A major executive restructuring is expected at UPN, including the
anticipated departure of President Dean Valentine. Valentine is not
scheduled to meet formally with reporters Monday, when the network
previews its midseason schedule.</LD>
<TE>   While noting that UPN has what he called "great building blocks"
with series such as "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," Moonves said it was
"way too early" to determine how the synergy would work, adding that
the combination "would be beneficial for both CBS and UPN."</TE>
<TE>   He said, for example, that UPN might carry some games during the
upcoming NCAA basketball tournament, which previously has aired
exclusively on CBS.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to cut costs and increase advertising revenue at UPN,
Viacom announced in December that it would combine CBS and UPN under
one management team headed by Moonves effective Jan. 1--a decision
that prompted the resignation of Paramount Television Group Chairman
Kerry McCluggage, who had been responsible for UPN.</TE>
<TE>   By merging the two networks, Viacom hopes to save around $10
million annually in advertising, programming and promotion, analysts
say. The company should be able to boost revenue by packaging UPN and
CBS commercial time for advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   In other CBS news, Moonves said the fourth edition of the
unscripted series "Survivor" would premiere Feb. 28, the night after
CBS broadcasts the 44th annual Grammy Awards. The finale of the third
installment aired Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Although less media attention has been focused on the third
edition of "Survivor," Moonves said the network is pleased with the
show, which, despite a ratings decline compared with last year's
second version, ranks as the fifth-most-watched series of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "Survivor: Marquesas" is being shot on the island of Nuku Hiva, a
distant neighbor of Tahiti.</TE>

<HD>Verizon Abandons Bid for Airwaves</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a second setback to government and industry efforts to put a major
swath of wireless spectrum to use, Verizon Wireless said Thursday
that it is abandoning its yearlong bid to secure a portion of $16
billion worth of airwaves owned by bankrupt NextWave Telecom Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by the nation's largest wireless carrier appears to
end any hope of reviving the controversial airwave settlement that
awarded NextWave about $6 billion in exchange for the transfer of its
197 wireless licenses to Verizon, VoiceStream Wireless Corp. and
several other carriers.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts speculate that Verizon and other like-minded carriers
will try to cobble together the additional capacity from other
carriers or by bidding in an upcoming auction of the 700-megahertz
spectrum that will be held by the Federal Communications Commission
later this year.</LD>
<TE>   In any event, Verizon said its patience has run out on NextWave.
"We are solely focused on getting our deposit back," Verizon
spokesman Jeffrey Nelson said of the $1.7 billion it gave the U.S.
Treasury last winter as a deposit on its wireless bids. "Until we get
it back, we are not interested in discussing any options with
NextWave."</TE>
<TE>   The nation's wireless carriers have been counting on amassing more
wireless spectrum, which is crucial to the delivery of advanced
services such as getting driving directions, the latest stock prices
and other information delivered instantly over mobile phones.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon, Sprint, AT&amp;T Wireless and others are in the midst of
spending billions of dollars to expand their networks to provide such
services.</TE>
<TE>   Hawthorne, N.Y.-based NextWave originally bid $4.7 billion for its
wireless phone licenses at a 1996 Federal Communications Commission
auction. But the company failed to pay for them and entered
bankruptcy proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC subsequently took back NextWave's licenses and
re-auctioned them last winter in a sale that raised $15.9 billion.
But NextWave successfully challenged that action in federal court and
won back its licenses.</TE>
<TE>   Industry and government officials had hoped to break the impasse
with a controversial settlement agreement that would have given
NextWave $6 billion in exchange for relinquishing control of its
licenses. But powerful lawmakers such as Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.)
and Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.) said they would oppose efforts to pass
legislation to cement such a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Congress adjourned last month without endorsing a government
decision to settle with NextWave before an industry-imposed deadline
of Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Although many analysts think a deal now is a longshot, some
smaller carriers have sought to rekindle settlement discussions. And
Blair Levin, a lawyer and former FCC chief of staff who now is an
investment analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc., thinks Verizon's
efforts to throw down the gauntlet may be an effort to once again put
lawmakers under pressure to quickly approve a deal.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing that Verizon is doing prevents the possibility" of a new
settlement, Levin said. "Tactically, if you want to wake up Congress,
asking for billions of dollars in money back is a good way to do it."</TE>

<HD>New Santa Ana REIT Seeks $110-Million IPO</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daryl Strickland</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new Santa Ana real estate investment firm, G REIT Inc., is planning
a public stock offering in hopes of raising as much as $110 million.
But investors are warned in the regulatory documents for the proposed
deal that the shares wouldn't trade on a public market.</LD>
<LD>   The real estate investment trust said it wants to sell as many as
11 million shares of common stock at $10 each, with 10 million shares
being offered to the public, according to documents filed Wednesday
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The firm plans to begin the offer in June, but said it could take
as long as two years to sell the shares. G REIT does not plan to use
an underwriter, and investors couldn't trade the shares on any public
market, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   G REIT said it plans to use much of the proceeds to acquire office
and industrial properties leased primarily by government agencies in
California and eight other states.</TE>
<TE>   G REIT will rely on an advisory firm, Triple Net Properties, to
run the business. G REIT and the advisor share many officers and
employees, creating a potential conflict of interest, according to
the company's filing.</TE>
<TE>   For example, G REIT Chairman and Chief Executive Anthony Thompson
also owns the advisory firm, which he co-founded in 1998, the
documents show.</TE>

<HD>Training Sites May Lose City Funding</HD>
<DH>Services: Four L.A. groups that train workers are appealing
after they failed a new certification process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Officials are preparing to slash more than $6 million in annual
funding to four Los Angeles job training centers, saying the centers
failed a new certification process designed to improve service to
both job seekers and the private sector.</LD>
<LD>   The action was taken by a city oversight panel that says it wants
to improve the private sector's confidence in the quality of services
offered by the training centers.</LD>
<LD>   Two of the organizations--East Los Angeles' CHARO Community
Development Corp. and the Pacific Asian Consortium in
Employment--have operated for decades and placed more clients in jobs
than many of the centers that received certification, city data show.</LD>
<TE>   All four groups are scheduled to appeal the matter Thursday to a
Los Angeles city panel.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so insulted that they would use a paper application process
to weed us out of a system and totally ignore the 25 years of
excellent track record we have," said PACE President and Chief
Executive Kerry Doi.</TE>
<TE>   He and CHARO Executive Director Richard Amador say the process was
vague and unfair, could jeopardize their existence and leave tens of
thousands of their predominantly immigrant clientele without reliable
service.</TE>
<TE>   But officials with the city-appointed Workforce Investment Board,
which oversees the federally mandated system of job centers, insist
that all were treated equally and note that 12 managed to pass. The
arduous process was critical to convince the private sector that the
hodgepodge of nonprofit centers operates with consistent high
standards and can churn out a trained work force.</TE>
<TE>   "The business community in general is not aware of this training
or has been skeptical of the system," said Charlie Woo, a toy import
company owner who chairs the WIB. "At the same time, we spend
hundreds of millions of [public] dollars a year on it. The confidence
of the private sector" is crucial.</TE>
<TE>   The two-year effort to certify the Worksource Centers--previously
known as One Stop Career Centers--stemmed from the federal Workforce
Investment Act, a 1998 measure designed to place more emphasis on the
private sector's needs.</TE>
<TE>   "With those changes came more heightened standards," said Diana
Peterson-More, who chairs the WIB's certification committee. "We felt
it was important to have a process that could really reward change
and recognize performance."</TE>
<TE>   The federal law also gave local Workforce Investment Boards, made
up of private-sector members, power equal to elected city
governments. Under the old law, the council and mayor could override
the private board.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the plight of those organizations that stand to lose their
funding probably will spark a showdown between the WIB and elected
officials. The L.A. City Council today is expected to take up a
motion by Councilman Nick Pacheco asking the WIB to grant CHARO a
reprieve to meet the new standards. Pacheco said council members who
represent the other organizations--PACE; Casa de Hermandad, which
serves the Mar Vista area; and Advanced Computing Institute, which
serves Koreatown and the Wilshire corridor--are considering joining
the motion.</TE>
<TE>   WIB members who volunteered their time as reviewers are opposing
the effort as a throwback to the days when political patronage helped
determine which organizations won contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "This is right back to square one," said Doris Bloch, who also
served on the WIB's predecessor, the Private Industry Council. Bloch
recalled one instance in which the PIC tried to slash funding to a
group with financial irregularities, but was overridden by the City
Council.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't the only instance where the City Council said, 'Too
bad,' or 'Do it,' she said.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco said CHARO should be granted a probationary period because
it provides critical services and has performed well.</TE>
<TE>   "We have community-based organizations that perform above what's
expected from them, and yet the WIB wouldn't certify them because of
methodology," he said. "We need to understand how a high-performing
organization can be criticized when they get such high results."</TE>
<TE>   The board in early 2000 opted for a certification process based on
the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, created in 1988 in the
name of the late secretary of Commerce. The award is granted to
entities that meet elaborate criteria to ensure "continuous quality
improvement."</TE>
<TE>   The award has become a forceful corporate marketing tool and has
increasingly been sought by the public sector to overcome stereotypes
of inefficient bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   The criteria used to evaluate the organizations included factors
such as leadership, strategic planning, customer and market focus,
and "process management" consistent with the Baldridge process, but
did not concentrate on the organizations' track record of job
placement, according to Lori Strumpf, the Washington, D.C.-based
consultant hired by the WIB to carry out certification.</TE>
<TE>   The organizations that failed to meet the standards scored low on
categories such as "how center staff are included in the strategic
planning process," "how the organization measures the effectiveness
of its leadership," and "how customer flow has changed to ensure
reduced and more accurate handoff between agencies," according to
appeal documents by CHARO and PACE.</TE>
<TE>   The heads of both nonprofits say they worked hard to restructure
their organizations and comply with the standards, but criticized
them as vague and unrelated to performance.</TE>
<TE>   Doi, who was recently trained as a Baldridge examiner, said that
the applications were scored in an improper and inconsistent way, and
that his organization's strong performance in serving the community
should have at least earned PACE a site visit from reviewers.</TE>
<TE>   PACE outperformed all other city contractors in placements of
welfare-to-work clients in the year ended in September, data show.
CHARO outperformed all others with placements of dislocated workers
and low-wage adults in eight months of 2000-2001, the most recent
data available.</TE>
<TE>   Doi and Amador said their organizations have undergone substantial
restructuring as part of the certification process. But neither PACE
nor CHARO scored high enough on their written applications to get a
site visit. "If we were not performing, then there's no question that
we should be decertified, or not certified," said Amador. "But we're
the best example of what the city had.... There's no one else who
could come in and substitute for us."</TE>
<TE>   The organizations that could not pass by Dec. 31 were informed
that they would lose their city funding. That amounts to at least
$1.6 million per year for each of the four rejected centers. Both Doi
and Amador said the lack of certification could jeopardize millions
of dollars in other state and federal contracts by damaging the
nonprofits' reputations.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to work force services, CHARO offers entrepreneur
training, computer classes, child care and loan-processing
assistance. PACE is involved in affordable housing development, small
business and youth services.</TE>
<TE>   Strumpf said she "read every application and every piece of
supplemental information" to ensure that volunteer reviewers were
applying consistent standards.</TE>
<TE>   The centers that didn't pass may have had strong performance data,
she said, but the certification system "focused on quality, not just
numerical quotas and price tags."</TE>
<TE>   Strumpf and others said even though the centers will lose their
funding if they lose their appeal, they can still apply for
certification. If they pass, they can reapply for funding in coming
years. But proposals have been received by the city from groups
hoping to replace them, so they will likely lose clients to those
groups.</TE>
<TE>   There are eight Workforce Investment Boards in Los Angeles
County--each appointed by local elected officials--but the Los
Angeles Workforce Investment Area and corresponding board are the
largest in the state and second largest in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Much of their mandate--to provide job services and training to
everyone from youth and seniors to welfare recipients and connect
businesses with workers--is carried out by the work force centers. In
the city of L.A., $137 million was budgeted this fiscal year for the
system of 15 One Stop centers and 10 smaller satellites.</TE>
<TE>   All boards across the country are in the process of certifying the
centers they oversee. Those nonprofit organizations are meant to
provide one-stop shopping to clients.</TE>

<HD>Overwhelmed by New Jobless</HD>
<DH>Economy: The state's unemployment offices are facing a rush
of applicants spurred by a recent benefits hike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jobless Californians applying for first-time unemployment insurance
claims this week have swamped the phone lines and offices of the
state's Employment Development Department, which is struggling to
keep up with the flood of applicants.</LD>
<LD>   State officials link this week's surge to a recent hike in
unemployment benefits that will boost the checks of some out-of-work
Californians by as much as $100 a week beginning this month. Because
the higher benefits apply only to new claims filed after Jan. 6, some
workers laid off in late 2001 held off filing for unemployment
benefits until now to take advantage of the higher payments.</LD>
<LD>   The EDD recorded more than 15,000 new claims Monday, said agency
Director Michael Bernick. That's 25% more than the comparable day a
year ago and almost triple the volume seen on some days during the
holiday lull. In contrast, new claims in the last week of December
were only about half what they were during the first week of the
month.</LD>
<TE>   "People were waiting" to qualify for the increased benefits,
Bernick said. "No question."</TE>
<TE>   Bernick said the agency knew the rush was coming and recently
hired 300 additional workers to help process the growing claims load.
But this week's crush of calls and some malfunctioning phone lines at
the agency's telephone processing centers Monday and Tuesday have led
to frustrating busy signals and voicemail recordings for many
unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   Laid-off maintenance worker Luis Wilson went to the downtown Los
Angeles EDD office Wednesday seeking help after more than a dozen
failed attempts to apply for benefits over the phone.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept getting a recording telling me to call back later,"
Wilson, 32, said. "But my rent is coming up. I need to talk to
someone now."</TE>
<TE>   California's jobless benefit claims, like those in the rest of the
nation, have been climbing all year because of the economic slowdown.
But the aftermath of Sept. 11 has brought a sharp spike in
joblessness in California, whose giant travel and tourism industry
has been walloped. From mid-September through late December, more
than 900,000 claims for unemployment benefits were filed in
California, a 20% increase over last year, according to the EDD.</TE>
<TE>   The strain has taxed the resources of the agency, which is
laboring to keep up with the load. The burden appears to have gotten
even heavier this week with the burst of new claims.</TE>
<TE>   Known as SB 40, the legislation mandating the benefits increase
was passed by the California Legislature just a few days after Sept.
11 and signed by Gov. Gray Davis on Oct. 1. It authorizes the first
unemployment benefits increase for Californians in a decade--as much
as $2,600 extra for some workers over the maximum payout period of 26
weeks, beginning with new claims in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and other public officials had hailed the benefits boost as
a way to help workers hurt economically by the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks. The irony is that the very workers hit immediately by the
post-attack fallout are among those least likely to benefit, unless
they had sufficient savings to hold off filing until after Jan. 6,
when the increase took effect.</TE>
<TE>   Some officials are scrambling to address that inequity. In his
State of the State address Tuesday, Davis said he'll push to make the
benefits retroactive to Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the EDD's phone system, which was set up in the
mid-1990s to replace the unemployment lines of old, has been barraged
with calls.</TE>
<TE>   "We're being inundated," the EDD's Bernick said. "We're receiving
more calls than the system can handle."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the increased call volume, Bernick said the system
has been hampered by technical difficulties. EDD officials said half
of the state's six call centers were down for about three hours
Monday, and five of six centers couldn't accept incoming calls for as
long as two hours Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Bernick said that those technical problems have been fixed but
that the call volume remained heavy Wednesday because of the backlog
of filers who couldn't get through earlier in the week.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the EDD's 400-plus offices around the state also are
seeing a boost in foot traffic from filers fed up with busy signals.
These offices no longer process unemployment claims. But Bernick said
staff there can provide applicants with claim forms and assistance in
filling them out. The EDD offices also will fax the completed forms
to the proper processing centers.</TE>
<TE>   Marie Quinn, manager of job services at the EDD's downtown Los
Angeles office, said a dozen people were lined up outside the
facility a half-hour before its 8 a.m. opening Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen lines for years," Quinn said. "People are telling
us they've been having difficulty with the phone system.... It's been
crazy."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to hiring extra personnel, Bernick said, the EDD is
reassigning workers from around the agency to attack the growing
volume of claims. He said the agency staff already is working
overtime and is planning to extend the hours of the telephone call
centers and open some offices for walk-in traffic on weekends,
perhaps as early as next week.</TE>
<TE>   Bernick said the agency likewise is considering expanding a pilot
program to put claims personnel back in EDD field offices. One such
program already is operating at an EDD facility in Pacoima.</TE>
<TE>   Within a few months, Bernick said, the EDD hopes to be able to
provide claims filing via the Internet. At present, applicants can
download forms from the agency's Web site but cannot complete and
file the forms online.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone here is very focused on the situation," Bernick said.
"It's our top priority."</TE>
<TE>   James Whitney, an unemployed customer service representative
visiting the EDD's downtown L.A. office Wednesday, hopes the
situation improves soon. Laid off in August, he said he has been
struggling with the EDD's telephone-based system ever since.</TE>
<TE>   "It's constantly busy, and it's been that way for months," Whitney
said. "You can dial until you dial your fingers off."</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Player With a French Twist</HD>
<DH>Media: Vivendi Universal CEO Jean-Marie Messier seems to
relish his increasingly high profile in the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For French media tycoon Jean-Marie Messier, his Hollywood moment had
arrived.</LD>
<LD>   There he was at the lectern of the International Ballroom of the
Beverly Hilton on Thursday, talking up his company's achievements in
a mix of bravado and humor as he sought to charm an American audience
of business and civic leaders, most of whom had never heard the
Frenchman before.</LD>
<LD>   The 45-year-old chairman and chief executive of Vivendi Universal
was the guest speaker at a Town Hall Los Angeles forum, joining an
exclusive club of media moguls who've been invited to speak,
including Viacom Inc. CEO Sumner Redstone and former AOL Time Warner
Inc. CEO Gerald Levin.</LD>
<TE>   A Hollywood outsider whose vision for Vivendi has faced skepticism
from U.S. investors, Messier is now the man of the moment after
orchestrating a series of high-profile strategic moves, including the
$10.3-billion acquisition of USA Networks Inc.'s entertainment
businesses, that have thrust Vivendi Universal into the top ranks of
entertainment companies.</TE>
<TE>   "We invited him because he is the new power player in Hollywood,''
said Deborah Weinberg, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles nonprofit
group that organizes forums featuring prominent business and
political leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The event essentially marked Messier's coming-out party in Los
Angeles and drew about 600 business and civic leaders, much larger
than other recent turnouts, organizers said.</TE>
<TE>   In an speech that lasted more than half an hour, Messier outlined
the vision for his company, declared his love for America and his new
home in New York, and boasted about his company's rise from an
obscure water utility to a "tier one'' media player.</TE>
<TE>   "Vivendi is a mover and will remain a mover," said Messier,
appearing relaxed and casual. He wore an open-collared,
shrimp-colored shirt beneath a charcoal-gray suit that displayed pins
of intertwined French and American flags.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like nothing more to move ahead and beat our
competitors," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Though Vivendi has been on a buying spree, the company has no
major expansions planned in 2002, he said. Messier also praised
Universal executives and dismissed speculation that he and Barry
Diller, the new head of Universal's movie, theme park and television
divisions, will be at odds.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care about egos," he said. "I do care about talent. Barry
is a very strong and talented man."</TE>
<TE>   Messier also defended his criticism of the French system of
cultural protectionism, saying Vivendi stands for "cultural
diversity."</TE>
<TE>   Messier poured on the charm, variously praising American movies
and culture--even California wine. Before his speech he worked the
audience, walking from table to table to introduce himself to
journalists and various entertainment business executives.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a real new face in town and lot of people are curious," said
Yvette Herrera, a manager at PricewaterhouseCoopers who works in the
entertainment industry. "For many of us, this was our first
opportunity to see him. I found him charming. He clearly articulated
his product."</TE>
<TE>   Relishing his high profile in the U.S., Messier said: "As we get
to know one another, I feel that fewer and fewer people think I'm
[New York Rangers hockey star] Mark Messier."</TE>
<TE>   Messier, who is married with five children, was born in Grenoble,
the son of an accountant.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from prestigious Ecole Nationale d'Administration
school for civil servants, he went to work for the French government
and later became an investment banker.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994 he joined French water utility Compagnie Generale des
Eaux, transforming the 147-year-old utility into a global media and
entertainment company.</TE>
<TE>   Messier was virtually unknown in Hollywood until a year ago, when
Vivendi acquired Canada's Seagram Co., which owned Universal Pictures
and Universal Group, in a deal valued at $30 billion.</TE>
<TE>   And in the last year, his company has aggressively expanded its
presence in the U.S. with a string of acquisitions--Houghton Mifflin,
online music service MP3.com and USA's entertainment assets.</TE>
<TE>   For all its U.S. expansion, Vivendi still faces a challenge
selling its message on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   To build a higher profile in the U.S., Messier moved into a
$17-million Park Avenue apartment in New York and has used every
opportunity to explain Vivendi to the media.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though we're a young year-old baby, we can surprise you," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Layoffs to Continue, Report Says</HD>
<DH>Labor: More than 1.6million jobs will be lost in U.S.
cities this year as a result of Sept. 11 attacks, study predicts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks will cost the nation's cities more
than 1.6 million jobs this year, according to a study of more than
300 metropolitan areas to be released today by the Milken Institute.</LD>
<LD>   Big cities will lose the largest number of jobs, led by New York,
projected to shed 150,000 more jobs this year than it otherwise would
have in industries ranging from advertising to financial services.
Los Angeles County is expected to log the second-highest number of
attack-related job losses, with 69,000 positions disappearing in
2002. Orange County will be harder hit on a percentage basis
according to the study, which the institute said is the first of its
kind.</LD>
<LD>   The report predicts that some smaller tourist destinations, though
posting fewer job losses overall than their larger counterparts, will
actually suffer more in relative terms, given their dependence on a
single industry. Milken economists ranked Las Vegas as the nation's
most vulnerable metropolitan economy because of its near-total
reliance on tourism--the sector hit hardest by the fallout from the
terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Las Vegas is expected to lose 41,000 jobs this year, representing
nearly 5% of total nonfarm employment, stemming from the falloff in
travel and tourism following Sept. 11, according to the Milken
figures. Myrtle Beach, S.C., with a projected 3,700 attack-related
job losses--3.6% of its job base--ranks No. 2 among the most affected
metro areas.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Orange County is projected to feel the effect of
attack-related job losses more keenly than Los Angeles County in
2002, given its smaller size and relatively greater dependence on
tourism. According to the study, Orange County will lose nearly
27,000 jobs this year as a direct result of the attacks. Those losses
represent a 1.83% decline in total nonfarm employment, compared with
a 1.65% contraction in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   However, tourism is expected to rebound faster than sectors such
as aerospace and high technology. Thus, Milken economists expect
Orange County and tourist magnets such as Las Vegas to recoup their
jobs losses more quickly than Los Angeles County, which is facing a
protracted slump in commercial aerospace.</TE>
<TE>   "In the short term, Los Angeles isn't going to be harmed as much
as places like Las Vegas or Orlando," said Ross C. DeVol, director of
regional and demographic Studies at the Milken Institute and one of
the study's authors. "But the impacts here are going to be longer
lasting."</TE>
<TE>   The report by the Santa Monica-based think tank is an attempt to
isolate and quantify the effect of Sept. 11 on regional economies
that already were experiencing a general slowdown. All told,
metropolitan areas across the U.S. are projected to lose 1.64 million
jobs in 2002, on top of the more than 1 million already reported to
have been lost in the wake of the attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   The study, which examined and ranked 315 metro areas, is an
outgrowth of a report Milken researchers prepared for local officials
in October to assess the potential effect of the terrorist attacks on
Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   DeVol said the economic ripples from the tragedy have touched
virtually every community in the country. But the degree of
vulnerability is linked to the diversity of each region's industrial
makeup. DeVol said Milken researchers calculated which industries
have been hardest hit following the attacks, then projected job
losses for each metro area based on the composition of that region's
job base.</TE>
<TE>   The most affected businesses include restaurants and bars, hotels,
amusement parks, air transportation, advertising and aircraft
production.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County ranked high in all of those categories, which
led to its No. 2 ranking in projected job losses for 2002 stemming
from the terrorist attacks. But the sheer size and diversity of
L.A.'s economy rendered it less vulnerable in relative terms. When
those losses are calculated as a percentage of its overall job base,
Los Angeles County ranked 31st in the Milken study.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Wichita, Kan., was ranked in the top 10 of
most-affected metro areas in percentage terms, because of its heavy
reliance on commercial aircraft production.</TE>

<HD>Battling Over 401(k) Reform</HD>
<DH>Finances: After Enron's collapse, lawmakers and others have
different ideas to change pension contribution rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush's call for a review of pension rules in the wake of
the Enron Corp. debacle makes some kind of 401(k) reform more
probable, experts said, but there remained sharp disagreement
Thursday about what form those changes should take.</LD>
<LD>   Enron workers lost an estimated $1 billion in 401(k) retirement
savings, much of it invested in company stock, when the Texas energy
company spiraled into bankruptcy late last year. Lawmakers, including
Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Jon Corzine (D-N.J.), have
introduced legislation that would restrict the amount of company
stock in 401(k) plans, allow employees to freely sell their company
shares and provide workers with more information about the need to
diversify their investments.</LD>
<LD>   At a news conference Thursday, Bush said he ordered his economic
team to "come up with recommendations how to reform the system to
make sure that people are not exposed to losing their life savings as
a result of bankruptcy, for example."</LD>
<TE>   Bush is giving the idea of reform "the presidential seal, which
obviously gives it more priority," said Dallas Salisbury, president
of the Employee Benefit Research Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's move was hailed by the American Benefits Council, an
employers' trade group that opposes the Boxer-Corzine bill. The
council hopes any reforms proposed by the Bush administration will be
less disruptive to company-provided plans than Democrats' proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an opportunity to ask and answer the right questions
before hasty legislation is enacted that might have unintended
negative consequences," said council president James Klein.</TE>
<TE>   Klein warned that any new restrictions could discourage employers
from offering 401(k) plans, or prevent companies from making matching
contributions. Companies aren't required by law to offer 401(k) plans
to their workers, or to make matching contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Other groups said the review should make clear that workers need
better education about the risks of putting too much of their
retirement money in a single stock, as well as more freedom to sell
company stock.</TE>
<TE>   In a 401(k) plan, workers save for retirement by contributing part
of their paychecks to a tax-deferred account. Part of the
contributions are often matched by the employer. The plans typically
offer a choice of investments, although many larger firms make their
matching contributions in company stock and prevent workers from
later selling those shares.</TE>
<TE>   Those restrictions need to be lifted so that workers can properly
diversify their accounts, said Barbara Roper, director of investor
protection for the Consumer Federation of America. The Boxer-Corzine
bill would give employees the right to sell company shares 90 days
after receiving them.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies should not be allowed to shift the responsibility for
retirement onto employees and then tie [workers'] hands when they try
to exercise that responsibility," Roper said.</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment was echoed by the National Center for Employee
Ownership, an Oakland nonprofit that promotes company stock purchase
plans for workers. Employees shouldn't be forced to hang on to stock
"if it's going to cause them an insecure retirement," said Scott
Rodrick, a center spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The American Society of Pension Actuaries, which represents
benefit plan professionals, also supports loosening restrictions on
the sale of company stock in 401(k) plans. But a group spokesman says
lawmakers need to find a way to protect workers without causing
employers to drop the plans.</TE>
<TE>   "What we don't want to do is overreact so that we're making it
harder to save for retirement," said Brian Graff, the society's
executive director.</TE>
<TE>   One of the Boxer-Corzine measures--capping company stock at no
more than 20% of a plan--drew fire from all sides as unfair to
workers and potentially unworkable. Klein said the rule would punish
employees whose companies perform well.</TE>

<HD>Late Surge Drives Up Holiday Sales</HD>
<DH>Retail: December results are better than expected, led by
discounters. The overall sector rose 2.3% from year ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumers dragged their heels for most of the 2001 holiday shopping
season but stepped it up just before and after Christmas, giving many
retailers a much-better-than-expected December and hope that the
first part of 2002 won't be so bad.</LD>
<LD>   Sales in the retail sector as a whole rose 2.3% in December
compared with the year-ago month, mostly because discounters such as
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. continued a year-long pattern of carrying the
composite number higher. Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. had expected an overall
retail sales gain of 0.9%.</LD>
<LD>   Still, many retailers surprised investors Thursday with reports of
strong sales or at least results not as far behind last year's as
some feared.</LD>
<TE>   According to the Goldman Sachs tally, department stores saw sales
slip 3.6%, better than the 4.7% decline analysts expected. Specialty
hard goods sellers, including consumer electronics stores, gained
0.6%, better than an expected loss of 2%.</TE>
<TE>   Discount stores, which Goldman Sachs estimated would gain 3.3%,
rose 5.7%.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers came in stronger across the board," said Michael
Niemira, an economist with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. "The
breadth of the better-than-expected sales tells us that a lot of
companies participated and got more of a lift at the end of the
month. The numbers also paint a better picture of the industry, it
shows better stability."</TE>
<TE>   Here's a sampling of retailers, sorted by how well they did:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Clear Winners:</TE>
<TE>   * Wal-Mart Stores. The world's largest retail chain, and one of
its most tried-and-true performers, said Thursday that strong sales
in December helped it post annual sales of more than $203 billion,
the first time it has topped $200 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart said December sales for stores open at least a year were
8% better than last year's, with its superstores gaining 8.2% and
Sam's Club warehouse stores rising 7.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said consumers nervous about the economy after Sept. 11
didn't stop buying, but many bought more carefully, with an eye
toward getting more for their dollars. Same-store sales, or sales by
stores open at least a year, are considered an important measure of a
company's overall health because the number excludes new and closed
stores.</TE>
<TE>   * Chico's FAS Inc. Even with a tough-to-beat gain last year of
34%, women's clothier Chico's still was able to sell 14% more of its
loose but well-constructed separates than last year at stores open at
least a year. The department-store prices at Chico's didn't deter the
company's customer base--high-income women older than 30--showing
that economic downturn or otherwise, some customer bases are more
resilient than others and some companies are better at giving them
the products they want.</TE>
<TE>   * American Eagle Outfitters Inc. What Chico's does for grown
women, American Eagle tries to do for teens and apparently does well.
With a 0.5% same-store sales gain, on top of a gain of 11.8% during
the same period a year ago, American Eagle did well with reasonable
prices and trendy appeal to young adults.</TE>
<TE>   Although markdowns were probably a help in bringing in traffic,
these stores offered less drastic reductions because of planned,
already low promotional pricing, which likely means well-protected
profit margins.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Strong With Reservations:</TE>
<TE>   * Williams-Sonoma Inc. The parent of its namesake stores and
Pottery Barn beat expectations, overcoming soft sales earlier in the
year with a same-store gain for November and December of 5.5%, which
included strong sales of full-price merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   With the sales news, analysts--noting the company's strong cost
controls and fewer merchandise discounts--rushed to raise earnings
estimates for the quarter and year.</TE>
<TE>   Banc of America analyst Shelly Hale said sales of home electronics
and furnishings outpaced the rest of the retail industry. At
Williams-Sonoma, such products did well without discounts that eat
into margins.</TE>
<TE>   * J. C. Penney Co. The moderately priced department store, which
spent the late 1990s boom lagging just about every other industry
player, posted some of the strongest gains in the department stores
division. Its 5.4% same-store sales gain beat estimates of a 4% to 5%
rise.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts attributed the positive changes at JCPenney stores--which
include better merchandise assortments--to new management, led by
one-time Federated Department Stores head Alan Questrom.</TE>
<TE>   * Pacific Sunwear of California Inc. The Anaheim-based retailer of
surf wear and skate wear products said its same-store sales gain of
4.1% for the five-week period ended Jan. 6 came from strong sales of
shoes, girls' clothing and accessories.</TE>
<TE>   The 719-store chain, which in October had lowered fourth-quarter
earnings projections to 33 to 37 cents a share, said it now expects
profit of 40 to 41 cents a share, down from 43 cents a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were expecting a profit of 35 cents a share, according to
a survey by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   * Wet Seal Inc. The Foothill Ranch-based seller of clothes for
girls and young women posted even rosier results for the holiday
season, prompting the company to issue glowing projections for the
new year.</TE>
<TE>   Same-store sales surged 10.2% in the five-week period, the same
gain as a year earlier. The 576-store chain expects the trend to
continue, which should help boost earnings by 10% to 15% for 2002,
said Chief Executive Kathy Bronstein.</TE>
<TE>   * Target Corp. Capitalizing on the value trend but somewhat
hampered by its traditional department stores division, Target
nonetheless posted a slight sales gain for the month of 0.6%, versus
expectations of a 2% to 3% company-wide loss.</TE>
<TE>   Its namesake stores posted a 1.8% sales gain, its Mervyn's
division recorded a better-than-expected 0.6% sales decline and its
Marshall Field's stores were in line with expectations at a 10% sales
slip.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Getting Better But ... :</TE>
<TE>   * Gap Inc. The nation's largest specialty store chain, which also
owns Old Navy and Banana Republic, finally offered a positive
surprise after posting months of dismal reports even worse than
pessimistic Wall Street had expected. Its same-store sales loss of
11% still beat expectations of a far worse December.</TE>
<TE>   The company also raised its earnings outlook for the current
quarter, reversing its earlier statements that the company's loss in
its fiscal fourth quarter would be greater than its third-quarter
shortfall of 6 cents per share. Still, some analysts warned about
heavy promotions and a long road ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Gap's showing, however, wasn't related to an improved offering and
did nothing to address a tough competitive environment, said Thomas
Weisel Partners analyst Anne-Marie Peterson.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Todd Slater of Lazard Freres &amp; Co. in New York titled his
Thursday report, "Gap: Hope Springs Eternal."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Still Struggling:</TE>
<TE>   * Kmart Corp. The nation's second-largest discount chain beat
estimates with a drop of only 1% in same-store sales in December,
versus estimates of declines of between 2% to 4%. Still, after
earlier analyst reports warned that the company may have to file for
bankruptcy later this year if sales don't improve and it doesn't
boost cash flow, no one is declaring a Kmart victory yet.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart said Thursday its earnings for the fiscal year ending this
month would fall short of Wall Street estimates and it disclosed it
was in talks with lenders on supplemental financing. The company said
it was discussing existing as well as supplemental financing as part
of a review of its liquidity position.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Leslie Earnest contributed to this report, and
Reuters was used in compiling it.</TE>

<HD>Workers Unearth Mastodon Remains at Construction Site</HD>
<DH>Discovery: The bones, estimated at 30,000 years old, are found at
the bottom of a deep pit in Simi Valley. They will be sent to L.A. museum
today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Workers digging home sites in Simi Valley have uncovered the
skeletal remains of a prehistoric mastodon that scientists are calling a
major discovery in California paleontology.</LD>
<LD>   The skull, tusks, jaws, teeth and femur of the long-extinct mammal
were found two weeks ago at the bottom of a 30-foot pit dug by workers
building the 800-home Big Sky Ranch project. The mastodon, which is
related to the modern-day elephant, will be shipped to the Los Angeles
County Museum of Natural History today for further study and a possible
exhibit.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe we have a whole Jurassic Park out here," said Mike Mayfield,
superintendent of the construction site, as he looked at a giant tusk on
a flatbed truck. "We have hit Indian skeletons. We hit a walrus skeleton
in Newbury Park, but this is the first mastodon" uncovered by the
company.</LD>
<TE>   Scientists say that unlike their cousin, the woolly mammoth, only a
handful of the smaller mastodons have been unearthed in California. Many
more have been found in the Midwest and on the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   The Simi Valley mastodon is estimated to weigh more than one ton and
be up to 30,000 years old. Its tusks alone are several hundred pounds
each, and its dozen 2-inch-long teeth are conical, unlike the flatter
grazing teeth of modern elephants.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite a big deal. Only a few mastodons have ever been found in
this area," said Cara Corsetti, project manager for paleontology at SWCA
Environmental Consultants in Mission Viejo, which sent scientists to the
Simi Valley site to excavate the mastodon. "We find a lot of marine
mammals in this area--whales, sea lions, seals, walruses, early
representatives of the sea cow group, but no mastodons."</TE>
<TE>   A huge mastodon was found in 1997 near Hemet during construction of a
dam in Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   While mastodon skeletons are rare, pygmy mammoth remains have been
found on the Channel Islands. Scientists believe there was once either a
land bridge to the islands or that the animals swam there. Mastodons
appeared 3.75 million years ago and became extinct about 11,000 years
ago. Scientists believe they were powerfully built, covered in reddish
hair and were up to 10 feet tall and 15 feet long--shorter but longer
than modern elephants.</TE>
<TE>   The Simi Valley discovery was made when a construction team was
digging a pit in one of the green hillsides off Erringer Road.</TE>
<TE>   Julia Frazier, a paleo-monitor hired to look out for bones and
fossils, was scrambling between 15 large ground scrapers as they took off
layers of dirt when she spotted something sticking up from the ground.
Work halted as she dug in the silt.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw what I think was part of the scapula [shoulder]," she said. "It
was literally just an inch out of the ground. I started picking away at
it with an ice pick, and a whole row of teeth began to emerge. I saw
these molars that were 5 inches across. I said, 'Please, don't be a cow.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, tusks and leg bones emerged. After more than a week, the
skeletal remains were extracted from the ground. They have all been
packed for shipping.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty excited because I was used to just finding shells and
small rib bones," Frazier said. "But to find a jaw fully intact and [for
it] to be from a mastodon was amazing."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Armstrong, a paleontologist from SWCA who supervised the dig,
said the mastodon was probably walking along the hillside when it died.
It was later covered by an ancient landslide and buried beneath 30 feet
of alluvial silt. Its precise age, now estimated at 30,000 years because
of the age of the soil it was found in, will be determined by experts at
the museum.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though some of these animals are common in our knowledge, in
terms of numbers of specimens there aren't many," said John Heyning,
deputy director for research and collections at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Natural History. "Each additional specimen provides us with
more insight into their lives. This really speaks to how much the
landscape of Southern California changed. Twenty thousand years ago we
had saber-toothed cats, mastodons and pygmy mammoths on the Channel
Islands."</TE>
<TE>   Heyning said the museum has mastodon remains in its George C. Page
Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong said mastodons had many of the same social habits as
elephants and that they traveled in herds. But unlike elephants, there is
no evidence that mastodons had burial grounds where they all went to die,
he said. Still, Armstrong said he thinks there could be more discoveries
at the site. The soil may be 30,000 years old, a mere blip in geological
time, but the bedrock beneath it is 30 million years old.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a chance we could find more animals in that area," he said.</TE>
<TE>   During his career in construction, Mayfield said he has found Chumash
artifacts and pottery, which were returned to the tribe. He even found a
Ford Model T buried in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   But the mastodon stunned him. "I brought my kids down here to see it,"
he said, looking at the deep pit where the bones were found. "It was very
exciting to see the thing there all in one piece."</TE>

<LD>Backed by his wealthy father and a list of national GOP political
figures, prosecutor Ron Bamieh has taken a commanding fund-raising lead
in the race for Ventura County district attorney.</LD>
<LD>   Campaign finance reports show the 35-year-old political neophyte has
amassed $313,500 since the start of his campaign, outpacing opponent Greg
Totten by nearly 2 to 1.</LD>
<LD>   Bamieh's father, a San Mateo businessman and major GOP contributor,
has donated $239,000. Bamieh has also received money from a Texas oil
tycoon, a former presidential candidate, two former ambassadors and the
national security advisor for former President George Bush.</LD>
<TE>   In contrast, Totten--the favored candidate of retiring Dist. Atty.
Michael D. Bradbury--has raised $178,100, mostly through small donations
from local attorneys, ranchers, educators and business leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Totten, 47, the chief assistant district attorney, has picked up a few
deep-pocket donors, including billionaire David Murdock, religious radio
broadcast mogul Edward Atsinger III and retired Thousand Oaks car dealer
Robert Nesen. They each gave $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Totten and Bamieh are vying to fill the seat occupied by Bradbury, who
will step down in January 2003 after six consecutive terms.</TE>
<TE>   Their race is already shaping up as an unprecedented money war that is
expected to yield an onslaught of mailers, TV ads and radio spots as both
candidates sprint toward the March 5 primary.</TE>
<TE>   "In the next seven to eight weeks, we are going to be bombarded by
those things," said attorney George Eskin, the former assistant district
attorney of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. "You're not going to be
able to turn on the television set without seeing a Bamieh commercial."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Bamieh has already spent more than his campaign has taken in,
including shelling out at least $64,000 in television advertising and
about $48,000 in radio ads.</TE>
<TE>   He has also spent more than $26,000 to hire one of the nation's top
campaign strategists.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur J. Finkelstein--known for his style of slamming opponents with
negative ads--has helped elect such conservative GOP politicians as Gov.
George E. Pataki of New York, Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina and
former Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York.</TE>
<TE>   The New York-based consultant also helped Benjamin Netanyahu win
election as Israel's prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   So why is Finkelstein signed on to a district attorney race in a
suburban California county?</TE>
<TE>   "It's called making a phone call," Bamieh said. "I knew him when I was
working in Washington, D. C."</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh worked on the campaign for former President George Bush and was
appointed to the Justice Department after graduating from law school in
1991.</TE>
<TE>   It was there, he said, that he met top Republicans who have
contributed to his campaign. They include Robert Mosbacher, a Houston oil
tycoon who was secretary of commerce under former President Bush. He gave
Bamieh $500.</TE>
<TE>   Glen Holden, the former U. S. ambassador to Jamaica, contributed
$1,000. Howard Wilkins, a major GOP contributor from Kansas and former
ambassador to the Netherlands, also contributed $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Brent Scowcroft, a Washington, D. C., consultant who served as the
national security advisor to former Presidents Ford and Bush, gave Bamieh
$250. And onetime Republican presidential candidate, former Tennessee
Gov. Lamar Alexander, contributed $500.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to work for the Bush administration and I was privileged and
honored to get to meet those people," Bamieh said. "And when I decided to
run, I wrote them letters and asked them to help me out."</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh's campaign contribution statements indicate he has received
small donations from a few local attorneys and retirees since the
fund-raising race began three months ago.</TE>
<TE>   But his war chest has largely been bankrolled by his father.</TE>
<TE>   And that has drawn sharp criticism by his opponent, who called
Bamieh's big-spending campaign a "slick effort to buy an election with
out-of-county money."</TE>
<TE>   "We are getting calls on almost a daily basis from people I don't know
who are volunteering in my campaign because they are offended by what
they see," Totten said. "It is very troubling why somebody would want
this office so badly that they are willing to go to that level."</TE>
<TE>   Totten said he has "well over 300 supporters to date who are
stakeholders in this community."</TE>
<TE>   Campaign finance reports show Totten has received $5,000 from rancher
Robert Pinkerton, as well as smaller donations from several local
farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks Mayor Ed Masry, the trial lawyer who gained fame after
he was portrayed in the movie "Erin Brockovich", contributed $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury donated $750. Simi Valley Police Chief Randy Adams and
supervisors Kathy Long and Frank Schillo each donated $100.</TE>
<TE>   And Totten received $1,000 from developers Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co.
and $1,000 from Community Memorial Hospital Executive Director Michael
Bakst.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh deflected the attacks on his campaign by criticizing Totten for
taking numerous donations from people who could seek favors from the
district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say that there is one candidate in this race who is
independent," Bamieh said.</TE>
<TE>   Herb Gooch, chairman of the political science department at Cal
Lutheran University, called the donations to both candidates enormous and
suggested the coffers will continue to grow as the election nears.</TE>
<TE>   "Yowee! That is a lot of money to spend in this county," Gooch said.
"This looks like it is well on its way to becoming a million-dollar
race."</TE>

<HD>Guilty Plea by Garofalo Ends Finance Probe</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ex-Huntington Beach councilman admits to one felony and 15
misdemeanors for voting on matters involving his business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Huntington Beach Councilman Dave Garofalo pleaded guilty
Thursday to one felony and 15 misdemeanors for repeatedly voting on
matters involving companies that bought advertising from his publishing
business.</LD>
<LD>   The plea ends a 17-month investigation by local and state prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   Garofalo, who resigned from office last month, was given a suspended
sentence by Superior Court Judge Ronald P. Kreber and placed on three
years' unsupervised probation. He must pay fines totaling $49,700 and
complete 200 hours of community service by April 1, 2003. He also cannot
run again for public office unless he can persuade a judge to clear his
record after three years.</LD>
<TE>   Of his fines, $47,000 will be paid to the state Fair Political
Practices Commission for 24 counts of violating financial reporting laws.
The commission is scheduled to formally approve the civil fines at a
meeting Tuesday in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The FPPC agreement requires Garofalo to pay $2,000 immediately and the
rest in 90 monthly payments of $500.</TE>
<TE>   The former councilman spoke cordially Thursday outside the courtroom
about what he called his "massive, total self-destruction."</TE>
<TE>   He insisted that he didn't realize it was illegal to vote after
soliciting tens of thousands of dollars in advertising from businesses
seeking city decisions. He said the punishment was harsh but admitted
that he broke the law.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to take my medicine," Garofalo, 56, said. "I've become the
icon. The icon has to pay the bill."</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors said Garofalo's behavior was not a case of a local
official inadvertently stumbling over state law. His votes spanned two
years and were "flagrant, repeated and consistent," Dist. Atty. Tony
Rackauckas said.</TE>
<TE>   "The disposition on this is a very good one," Rackauckas said. "It
puts into perspective what was going on with Mr. Garofalo."</TE>
<TE>   The felony violation stems from Garofalo's vote in 1999--with a
unanimous council--for the city to fund the Huntington Beach Conference
and Visitors Bureau, for which Garofalo had published an annual visitors
guide since 1993. Under the contract, the city funded the nonprofit
bureau with $200,000 for 1999-2000 and $270,000 for 2000-2001. The
agreement allowed Garofalo to keep the advertising revenue from the
guide.</TE>
<TE>   Garofalo also published a newspaper called the Local News, the
directory for the city's chamber of commerce and two political mailers
called Huntington Beach Today, distributed in 1994 and 1998--the same
years Garofalo ran for council.</TE>
<TE>   The misdemeanor violations involved 15 companies seeking city
approvals that paid Garofalo from $500 to $13,000 annually for
advertising between January 1998 and August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The FPPC fine stemmed from Garofalo's failure to report that and other
income on annual statements of economic interest. Among the unreported
economic benefits: being placed in the top position on a waiting list to
purchase a home, which he sold a day later to a friend; and receiving a
discounted rate from December 1997 to May 1998 for a three-room suite at
the Huntington Beach Holiday Inn.</TE>
<TE>   The commission estimated that the benefit of being first on the
waiting list was $20,000. The fair market value of the hotel rooms was
$267 a night; the resulting gift totaled $6,510 for 1997 and $32,550
during 1998, according to the FPPC.</TE>
<TE>   Garofalo also failed to report advertising "trades" that included a
$6,000 discount from the Waterfront Hilton for his daughter's wedding;
mirror and glass work at his house worth $1,673; patio furniture worth
$3,896; home landscaping worth $6,315; and $4,000 in real estate
commissions from Century 21.</TE>
<TE>   His fine is neither the smallest nor largest levied in a political
case: The largest fine topped $800,000, FPPC spokeswoman Sigrid Bathen
said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Debbie Cook, a chief Garofalo critic, filed ethics complaints
against him in May 2000. Cook was elected to the council in 2000 and is
now mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just relieved that it's over," she said Thursday. "It was a
year too long. It was clearly something that should have been
investigated years ago and there wouldn't have been so many complaints
against him. People lose faith in government when things like this drag
on and on."</TE>
<TE>   Fellow Garofalo critic Susie Newman, who also filed an ethics
complaint against him, said she wasn't satisfied with the sentence: "For
the length of the investigation and the resources that were spent, this
was a pretty meager end."</TE>
<TE>   The city began the investigation of the ethics complaints in June
2000, after The Times reported that Garofalo voted at least 87 times
since his 1994 election on matters affecting advertisers in his
publications. State law requires elected officials who receive $250 or
more in income to abstain for a year from voting on matters involving the
giver.</TE>
<TE>   In August 2000, Garofalo became the target of investigations by the
Orange County District Attorney's office and the political practices
commission. He continued to serve on the council, but abstained on votes
involving advertisers beginning in June 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Before the probe was through, the then-mayor would suggest that his
votes could have topped 300.</TE>
<TE>   During the same period, Garofalo deposited $61,046 into his bank
accounts from payments by seven advertisers, according to court
documents. There were more than 100 advertisers in the Visitors Guide
from 1995 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Garofalo insisted that he took care of the conflict-of-interest issue
in January 1998 by selling his publishing interests to a friend,
businessman Ed Laird. But investigators said that the sale was on paper
only and that Garofalo continued to control all aspects of his
publications--including sole check-signing authority--until June 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "It became clear Garofalo violated the law and knew he violated the
law and tried to cover it up," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Lubinski,
who handled the case.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach community leaders said Thursday that they were glad
the scandal is behind them.</TE>
<TE>   "It was completely appropriate for him to resign in light of this,"
Councilwoman Connie Boardman said. "I think it's unfortunate when anyone
in a position of power violates the trust of the people, but in this case
at least he was held responsible for his actions."</TE>
<TE>   Ron McLin, owner of the Longboard Bar and Grill and a member of the
Downtown Merchants Assn., believes that the controversy dragged on too
long.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to have seen him get out of the council a long time
ago," McLin said. "I think it's good to see us put this behind us."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Ralph H. Bauer, who considers his former colleague a
friend, said Garofalo has shown his character in other ways, by caring
for his ailing mother and son "through some terrible times."</TE>
<TE>   "You measure the person by their children to some degree, and by that
standard, he's a pretty decent guy," Bauer said. "I don't believe in
beating somebody when they're down. He'll pay the price and the system
will do what it has to do."</TE>
<TE>   Garofalo's daughter, Nancy Garofalo Gray, said her father had taken
"beating after beating" over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved serving the city of Huntington Beach," she said. "It's a
shame it had to end this way. He tried his hardest to not have this
affect people around him. He has remained passionate about the issues and
his job and about his family through all of this."</TE>
<TE>   Garofalo said he hasn't received a paycheck in more than a year and
hasn't decided what he'll do next. He said he planned to take "a break"
and assess his future, including where to serve his community time; the
court must approve his selection. He sits on the boards of directors of
12 community groups.</TE>
<TE>   He said his only regret was in "relying on others for advice"--a
reference to City Atty. Gail Hutton, whom he has repeatedly said gave him
the go-ahead to cast votes. Hutton has said she outlined the law and told
him to follow it when voting.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms of his plea, Garofalo could petition a judge in three
years to reduce his felony conviction to a misdemeanor, then to have it
removed from his record--clearing the way for him to run again for
office.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he would consider that, he replied, "I can't conceive of
being that stupid."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Judge Accused of Child Molesting</HD>
<DH>Crime: Alleged victim came forth after learning of child porn
charges against Ronald C. Kline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County judge already under house arrest for allegedly
possessing child pornography was arrested again Thursday and charged with
molesting a 12-year-old boy nearly a quarter-century ago.</LD>
<LD>   Local authorities accuse Superior Court Judge Ronald C. Kline, 61, of
befriending the youngster, who lived in his Irvine neighborhood, and
sexually abusing him at least four times between 1976 and 1978. Kline was
a prominent civil attorney at the time.</LD>
<LD>   In 1980, without knowing about their son's alleged contact with Kline,
the boy's parents filed a stalking complaint against Kline after noticing
him driving slowly past the house, police said. No charges were ever
filed as a result of the complaint.</LD>
<TE>   Police said the accuser, now 37, told investigators about the sexual
abuse this month after learning from news reports that the judge faces
federal charges of storing more than 100 illegal pornographic images on
computer.</TE>
<TE>   Kline's attorney, Paul S. Meyer, said his client intends to plead not
guilty to the molestation charges at a Feb. 6 arraignment.</TE>
<TE>   "The allegation is untrue," Meyer said. "The historical charges . . .
are from 26 years ago and involve one complaining person."</TE>
<TE>   The latest charges set up a highly unusual judicial election in March.
The judge remains a candidate for reelection even though he is confined
to his home. Kline is running unopposed on the ballot, though eight
people have announced they will be write-in challengers.</TE>
<TE>   Write-in candidates rarely win elections. And if Kline wins the
election, he would remain on paid leave--drawing on his $136,244 annual
salary--until his criminal cases are resolved or the state Commission on
Judicial Performance disciplines him.</TE>
<TE>   Kline surrendered to Irvine police at 7 a.m. Thursday. He posted bail
of $100,000 and returned to his Irvine home, where he has remained under
federal house arrest since a federal grand jury indicted him on the
pornography possession charges in November.</TE>
<TE>   The latest allegations are the most serious leveled against Kline, who
pleaded not guilty to the pornography charges. The accusations have left
the judge's former colleagues in shock, including the man now supervising
his prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   "This is someone who I felt I knew and had a friendship with, so it's
sad," said Tony Rackauckas, who worked alongside Kline as a judge before
becoming district attorney three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they interviewed the alleged molestation victim and
have independently corroborated that Kline knew him at the time of the
alleged molestation. His name is being withheld even though he is now an
adult.</TE>
<TE>   The accuser's parents told police more than two decades ago that Kline
was stalking their son, according to court records filed by prosecutors.
Nothing then could be done about the complaint because there was no
specific law against stalking at the time, said Irvine Police Lt. Sam
Allevato.</TE>
<TE>   The stalking report was destroyed years ago during a routine purging
of old records, Allevato said.</TE>
<TE>   Court records indicate that Kline vacationed with the accuser in
December 1982, after he had turned 18. In a letter he sent to the boy
before the vacation, Kline wrote that he had one request--that he "please
not bring pajamas."</TE>
<TE>   A diary written on the judge's home computer made references to the
judge's attraction to young boys, including a 2000 entry naming the
accuser, the records said. Entries dated last year referred to attempts
by Kline to find the accuser and to include him as an heir in the judge's
will, according to the court records.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the accuser remained silent about the abuse until 1995,
when he told his parents and fiance. He insisted then, however, that he
did not want to report the matter to police, court records show.</TE>
<TE>   But authorities said he changed his mind after learning of Kline's
recent federal indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Kline now faces four felony counts accusing him of committing lewd
acts on a child under 14--charges that carry a maximum of 14 years in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   State law allows prosecution of child molestation cases even when
victims come forward years after the crimes were committed. Under the
law, prosecutors must file charges within one year of a complaint being
made.</TE>
<TE>   If Kline wins reelection in March, his future as a judge will rest on
the outcome of his court cases. If he pleads guilty or is convicted of a
felony, the state's Commission on Judicial Performance will suspend him
without pay, commission officials said.</TE>
<TE>   If an appeals court overturns the conviction, Kline will be reinstated
and paid back pay for the time on suspension. If, however, Kline's
appeals are rejected, the commission will remove him permanently from the
bench.</TE>
<TE>   The last time the commission removed a judge because of a criminal
conviction was in 1990, when Beverly Hills Municipal Judge Charles Boags
was fired, said commission Director Victoria Henley.</TE>
<TE>   Boags had been convicted of obstruction of justice in 1988 for
improperly suspending fines on parking tickets issued to his son and his
son's friends.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura County Fairgrounds will be the site of three popular
events this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Six hundred vendors will set up shop for a two-day gun show, which
typically attracts about 7,000 people, said Lori McMann, the show's
manager.</LD>
<LD>   The gun show will run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and from 9 a.m.
to 4 p.m. Sunday in Anacapa and San Miguel halls. Admission is $8, and
children 11 and younger are free.</LD>
<TE>   In Santa Rosa Hall, a doll, bear and toy show will feature about 70
vendors. The toy show runs from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday only.
Admission is $4.50 for adults, $3 for children ages 4 to 12 and free for
children 3 and younger.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a few hundred felines will gather for an all-breed cat show

<HD>Sheriff's Deputy Hurt When SUV Hits His Motorcycle</HD>
<DH>Accidents: Another man was injured in a separate crash. Both backed

<DL></DL>
<LD>Traffic accidents on either side of Ventura County snarled traffic
Thursday morning and injured two people, one of them an on-duty sheriff's
deputy.</LD>
<LD>   About 7:40 a.m., motorcycle Deputy Mike Sahlman was attempting to stop
a speeding driver on Avenida de Los Arboles when a sport utility vehicle
struck him near Wildwood Elementary School in Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   The SUV, driven by Robin Buell, 55, pulled in front of Sahlman while
trying to turn left into the school parking lot, said Sgt. Patti Salas, a
traffic investigator in the sheriff's East County Division.</LD>
<TE>   Sahlman, who was thrown from his motorcycle, was taken to Los Robles
Regional Medical Center for treatment of a broken left hip socket, Salas
said. Buell was not injured.</TE>
<TE>   California Highway Patrol officers closed Avenida de Los Arboles at
Canna Street until about 11:30 a.m. No citations were issued.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after 8 a.m., CHP officers responded to an accident on the
Ventura Freeway south of the Victoria Street onramp in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Steve Reid said that Rodrigo Martinez, 22, of Ojai lost
control of his pickup truck while heading south in the fast lane, causing
him to swerve to the right into a compact car.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, who was not wearing a seat belt, was ejected when his truck
ran off the highway and landed in an embankment, Reid said. The truck
rolled downhill and caught fire.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez was taken to Ventura County Medical Center with back
injuries. The driver of the compact car, Sean Freyne, 32, of Ventura was
not injured, the officer said.</TE>
<TE>   Officers closed the freeway's slow lane for about an hour during
rush-hour traffic, causing a backup for at least 2 1/2 hours.</TE>
<TE>   "It was horrendous," Reid said.</TE>
<TE>   No citations were issued in the accident.</TE>

<HD>Hoffman Leads in Campaign Donations</HD>
<DH>Election: Businessman overcomes late start in supervisor's race to
surge past Parks. He's aided by wealthy developer, who also gave to
Mikels in other board contest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a late start, Thousand Oaks businessman Randy Hoffman has
amassed $152,000 in his push for a seat on the Ventura County Board of
Supervisors, outstripping the $64,000 raised by rival Linda Parks.</LD>
<LD>   Hoffman's donations came from an array of well-heeled individuals and
business owners in the Thousand Oaks area. One major backer is
billionaire David H. Murdock, chief executive of Dole Food Co. and
developer of the luxury Lake Sherwood estates. Murdock and his company
donated cash and services worth $66,000.</LD>
<LD>   Parks, a Thousand Oaks councilwoman, stuck to a pledge to accept no
more than $500 per contributor. She listed environmentalists, supporters
of the SOAR anti-sprawl initiatives, retirees, homemakers and Hollywood
director Rob Reiner as backers.</LD>
<TE>   With the election seven weeks away, one political analyst likened the
high-profile race to an air-versus-ground war. Hoffman will funnel his
money into costly cable television ads while Parks rallies a corps of
dedicated grass-roots supporters, said Herb Gooch, chairman of the
political science department at Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "Hoffman will do the TV media blitz because he's not as well-known a
commodity as she is," Gooch said. "Parks has shock troops on the ground,
who have been through multiple elections. They're consistent, they know
what they're doing and they're battle-hardened."</TE>
<TE>   Finance statements reflect donated cash and goods through Dec. 31.
Additional filings are due later this month.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates will face off in the March 5 primary for the 2nd
District seat being vacated by retiring Supervisor Frank Schillo. Because
there are no other challengers, the primary will determine who wins the
office.</TE>
<TE>Murdock Also Aids Mikels Campaign</TE>
<TE>   In the other supervisorial contest, 4th District incumbent Judy Mikels
raised $53,595, bringing her war chest to $66,370. Murdock again played a
major role, giving Mikels $25,000, or about half of the dollars raised
for the reporting period.</TE>
<TE>   Mikels said Murdock has become an acquaintance during the last two
years. He asked for her help ushering improvements to his Ventura Farms
estate through the county's Planning Department and she complied, Mikels
said.</TE>
<TE>   "What he has told me is that he believes I've worked hard for
agriculture and Dole is one of the biggest buyers here in the county,"
Mikels said. "I'm a fiscal conservative and pro-business, and my attitude
toward streamlining bureaucracy is in line with his."</TE>
<TE>   Finance reports for Mikels' opponent, Moorpark fraud investigator John
Lane, show he raised just under $46,000, the bulk of that a $30,000 loan
to himself.</TE>
<TE>   Most of his remaining contributions came from law enforcement,
including $5,000 from a local deputy sheriff's union that has attacked
Mikels for failing to usher through a benefits package it is seeking.</TE>
<TE>   Lane, a retired Los Angeles Police Department officer, said he is
proud to receive the financial backing of police and fire agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "When folks get wind of where the funds are coming from--police and
firefighters versus a billionaire land developer--we'll see how voters
perceive it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock's influence is also being questioned in the Thousand Oaks
race. Parks suggested Murdock is willing to bankroll Hoffman's campaign
because, she said, the businessman would be more favorable toward
development projects that come before supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   "I anticipate Mr. Hoffman spending a million dollars to try to buy a
seat," said Parks, who has long advocated stronger growth controls. "That
doesn't change who I am and how I am going to run my campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman defended Murdock's support, saying the billionaire knows him
from his 1998 congressional race against Democrat Brad Sherman and that
he appreciates Murdock's business background. He also suggested that
while Parks is limiting her donations, he said she will be helped late in
the campaign by well-heeled backers who pump independent money into her
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll make sure we are not outspent, even if I have to put my own
money into the race," Hoffman said. "But $1 million is not even anywhere
close to our projection."</TE>
<TE>   Another big contributor to Hoffman is financier William D. Dallas of
Lake Sherwood, who gave $25,000. Hoffman described Dallas as a close
friend who often contributes to causes he believes in.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman's campaign manager Joel Angeles acknowledges his candidate
intends to use television heavily to make his name and face more familiar
to voters. Although Hoffman ran for office once before and is known in
the business community for starting a successful technology company,
Parks has greater name recognition as a sitting councilwoman.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as the money comes in, we are spending it," Angeles said. "We
ran ads for four weeks in December and we've got new commercials running
now. We'd like to be on the air every day between now and the election."</TE>
<TE>   In the two other county races on the March ballot, donations have been
more modest.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Treasurer-Tax Collector Larry Matheny has underwritten most
of his campaign for the treasurer-tax collector's seat. He reported
raising $50,300, donating $9,300 of his own money and loaning himself
$41,000.</TE>
<TE>   His opponent, Mike Markey, a former Thousand Oaks City Council member,
did not file papers with the county.</TE>
<TE>   In the crowded race for county clerk--recorder, another contest with
no incumbent, county Republican Party Chairwoman Jackie Rodgers reported
$8,778 in contributions, including $6,204 in loans to herself and $250
from state Republican Party Chairman Shawn Steel.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard City Clerk Daniel Martinez had $10,000 in loans to himself.
Assistant County Recorder Philip J. Schmit reported $350 in
contributions, and Michael Wesner reported no contributions. Ventura
County Board of Education member Yvonne Gallegos Bodle and Simi Valley
business executive John Reid did not file reports.</TE>

<HD>Man Pleads Not Guilty to Killing Live-In Girlfriend</HD>
<DH>Hearing: The murder suspect was arrested in December after he was
found on a cliff near where authorities discovered body parts floating in
the ocean.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 37-year-old tile setter pleaded not guilty Thursday to a charge
of murder for allegedly chopping up his live-in girlfriend and dumping
her remains into the ocean near Point Mugu.</LD>
<LD>   Alfonso Castillo nodded his head but said nothing as his attorney,
Deputy Public Defender Doug Daily, spoke to him.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Vincent O'Neil set a preliminary hearing in the
case for Feb. 26.</LD>
<TE>   The Panorama City resident is accused of killing Maria Guadalupe
Pinaloza Ambrio, 34. He is being held at Ventura County Jail in lieu of
$1-million bail.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo was arrested early Dec. 6 on a dark stretch of Pacific Coast
Highway just south of Mugu Rock.</TE>
<TE>   A sheriff's deputy patrolling the area noticed Castillo's Ford Ranger
parked illegally along a gravel strip at the edge of a cliff leading down
to the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   A deputy who confronted Castillo as he climbed up the rocky slope said
the suspect was covered with blood. Castillo did not object when deputies
asked to search his truck, but tried to escape when they noticed blood in
the vehicle, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   As Castillo sat handcuffed on some rocks, deputies shone flashlights
on the churning surf and saw limbs and other body parts bobbing in the
waves.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's search-and-rescue teams and a Coast Guard cutter searched
the water off Mugu Rock the next day but turned up no weapon at the scene
and few additional clues in the case, authorities said.</TE>

<LD>Since childhood, when she'd hold the spittoon while her father
worked on the teeth of Mexican orphans, Debbe Magnusen knew that not all
children catch a break in this world.</LD>
<LD>   And here she is, having turned 46 this week, spending much of her
waking life for the last five years running a national organization out
of a Costa Mesa office that tries to give infants a fighting chance.</LD>
<LD>   The odds can be formidable.</LD>
<TE>   Providing free dental work is one thing. Magnusen's quest is to keep
infants from being discarded in Dumpsters, toilets, bushes or on
strangers' doorsteps.</TE>
<TE>   To most of us, abandoning a newborn is unthinkable. Spend a little
time with Magnusen and her co-worker, Angel Waters, a woman in her 20s,
and you'll think otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Telephone calls come in from all over the country. They come in broad
daylight and in the middle of the night.</TE>
<TE>   Since mid-December, Waters says, they've handled 68 calls from girls
lamenting their unwanted pregnancies. You'd think these girls, almost all
teenagers, would notify Magnusen early in the pregnancy. It doesn't
always work that way.</TE>
<TE>   "We had one girl who said she saw us on TV and said she had delivered
at home and asked if I could meet her," Magnusen says. "She told me to
head for Garden Grove and she'd tell me where to go on the way there."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Magnusen met the girl at the bleachers of a local high
school, where she handed her an infant wrapped in a towel. Magnusen took
the girl and baby to a local hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Magnusen's operation (consisting of her and Waters and a network of 35
volunteer phone operators) is called Project Cuddle.</TE>
<TE>   It began as a group that provided toys but since 1996 has concentrated
on persuading frightened or uncaring young girls not to abandon their
babies.</TE>
<TE>   Magnusen's efforts have been fueled by her appearances on daytime
programs such as those hosted by Oprah Winfrey and Montel Williams, as
well as mainstream media coverage on programs such as CBS' "48 Hours."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 400 babies have been saved from abandonment and, most likely,
death, according to Magnusen's records.</TE>
<TE>   It is a pace that would wear out both Magnusen and Waters, they say,
if the outcomes weren't so rewarding.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't do it if Angel weren't here," Magnusen says, getting a bit
teary as she discusses her friend working across the room. "I used to
have to do it 24/7. If I took a shower, I'd have to have the phone by the
shower. I couldn't have the door shut."</TE>
<TE>   The job was nonstop, she says, because unwanted pregnancies continue
unabated in America. It's hard to find statistics on abandoned
babies--obviously, no one can be sure how many babies are never
discovered--but a number of states have passed laws making it easier for
young mothers to leave unwanted babies at hospitals without facing
punishment.</TE>
<TE>   That followed a spate of publicity about "Dumpster babies" that made
headlines. The Project Cuddle hotline is (888) 628-3353. People who might
want to volunteer can find the local number in the phone book.</TE>
<TE>   Magnusen, who throughout our interview wore a headset in case the
phone rang and filled envelopes for a fund-raiser, now faces another
problem.</TE>
<TE>   The lease on her Costa Mesa office has expired. The operation has
depended on private donors and an annual fund-raising dinner to pay
bills. (This year's will be March 22 in Newport Beach.) But Magnusen
longs for a corporate sponsor that would provide office space. She also
needs two more employees, she says.</TE>
<TE>   If not . . . life goes on.</TE>
<TE>   "Our dream is to be a household name," Magnusen says. "I knew from the
day I started this, it was going to be big."</TE>
<TE>   I ask how she and Angel handle the workload. "We just do it," Magnusen
says. "There's no option. For the sake of the baby, you just do it."</TE>

<HD>Court Throws Out OK of Irvine Co. Complex</HD>
<DH>Development: Judge's ruling says huge office project is
inconsistent with the city's general plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County judge threw out the approval of a massive office
complex the Irvine Co. planned to build on strawberry and bean fields
near the former El Toro Marine Corps base.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge William McDonald ruled last week that the
10-million-square-foot project, which had been approved by the city of
Irvine, was inconsistent with the city's general plan.</LD>
<LD>   The judge's ruling stated that the city "failed to comply" with clear
requirements of state law because it did not consider the project's
impacts on dwindling farmland, ground-water contamination, and other
issues.</LD>
<TE>   The city also failed to look at alternative proposals solely because
they weren't acceptable to the Irvine Co., McDonald said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is one of strongest decisions we've ever experienced. This clearly
shows that Irvine is a company town," said Bob Caustin, founder of the
Newport Beach-based environmental group Defend the Bay, which
successfully challenged the plan in court.</TE>
<TE>   "They were not representing their citizens nor were they representing
the community. They were representing the Irvine Co. very well, though."</TE>
<TE>   Defend the Bay sued the city in June, saying the city's approval
violated state law because the city failed to address significant effects
on open space, water quality, traffic, air pollution, ground-water
contamination, electricity usage and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Irvine council members voted unanimously to rezone 604 acres
of agricultural land on the northeast side of the city for research and
industrial use.</TE>
<TE>   That cleared the way for 10.2 million square feet of office space
southeast of Jeffrey Road and north of Interstate 5.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Co. parcel, which is unincorporated county land in the
city's sphere of influence, houses one of the last expanses of farmland
in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   If the project is built as envisioned, it would bring more than 16,000
new jobs to Irvine, although 2,200 farm workers would lose their
employment.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of approval, city officials said the benefits of the
development, including donated park space and new property taxes,
outweighed negative impacts, such as increases in air pollution and
traffic and worsening the housing shortage.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Mayor Larry Agran said he is confident the city can alleviate
the judge's concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "Those sound like fairly traditional recitations of deficiencies that
are easily remedied by additional environmental review work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are of the view that the city did an excellent job in preparing a
thorough environmental review document. To the extent that the judge
cited some minor deficiencies, that can and will be remedied."</TE>
<TE>   An official with the Irvine Co., which had hoped to have the site
built out in 2005, said the judge's decision could cause a six-month
delay.</TE>
<TE>   "We're surprised, given the reputation the city has for the quality,
depth and comprehensive nature of their [environmental review] work,"
said spokesman John Christensen.</TE>
<TE>   "We're confident we can work with the city and address the concerns
raised by the judge."</TE>
<TE>   Caustin, though, says he believes the ruling could kill the project.</TE>
<TE>   "In the long term, I think we'll be able to stop them," he said. "The
next step is trying to get the city of Irvine to change its position from
destroying what many of us moved here for to preserving it. You can't
just wipe out all that [farm] land."</TE>

<HD>Environmental Suit Targets Plan for Joplin Youth Camp</HD>
<DH>Courts: The county is accused of skirting review rules, but
probation officials say proposed facility is defensible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Trabuco Canyon environmental group filed a lawsuit Thursday
against the county's proposed 90-bed expansion at Joplin Youth Center,
saying it violates state laws.</LD>
<LD>   "We agree that something needs to be done to help with more beds for
juveniles," said Richard Gomez, a spokesman for the Saddleback Canyons
Conservancy. "But the law says to avoid significant effects where
feasible."</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed in Sacramento Superior Court by the Rural Canyons
Conservation Fund and the Saddleback conservancy, alleges that the county
created a special planning district "to bypass environmental protections"
for the 90-bed Rancho Potrero Leadership Academy, which would house boys
and girls at the existing Joplin youth camp.</LD>
<TE>   It also alleges that a proposed paved road leading to the facility
through Trabuco Creek could cause extensive environmental damage.</TE>
<TE>   The expansion was approved by the Board of Supervisors in December
after a tedious planning process that took about two years.</TE>
<TE>   County Probation Department officials are confident that the planning
process for the academy will survive a court challenge, said Thomas G.
Wright, chief deputy probation officer.</TE>
<TE>   "We expected it and we are prepared," he said. "We have an
administrative record that is ready to go to court that will defend our
proposal."</TE>
<TE>   Canyon residents have fought long and hard against the proposed
academy, arguing that the site is too environmentally sensitive. Located
behind the small Trabuco Canyon community, Joplin is next to the
Cleveland National Forest in brushland filled with wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   The road proposal has been criticized by several public agencies,
including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the state Department of
Fish and Game, because of the harm it could cause to the endangered
southwestern arroyo toad and fish species, Gomez said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are other places in the county to put such a facility," he
said. "In fact, we suggested the [closed] El Toro [Marine base], where
Cal State Fullerton recently opened satellite classes. If the county
really has a need for more beds, they could move into El Toro on Monday
while they sort things out."</TE>
<TE>   The Probation Department, however, has been steadfast in saying the
Joplin site is the most suitable. The agency is pushing to finish
construction by a Dec. 31, 2003, deadline to avoid jeopardizing an
$8.4-million grant from the state Board of Corrections.</TE>

<HD>EIR on Water Imports Rejected</HD>
<DH>Resources: Appellate panel tosses out report proposing use of Kern
County water for future housing in the Santa Clarita Valley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL CHAMBERS</AU>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state appellate court on Thursday threw out an environmental
impact report that proposed importing Kern County water for future
subdivisions in the Santa Clarita Valley, including the 21,000-home
Newhall Ranch project.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of Newhall Ranch said the ruling is a setback for the
project. But an attorney for the water-importing agency downplayed the
order, saying the subdivision would use little of the water.</LD>
<LD>   In its 20-page opinion, the 2nd Appellate District Court in Los
Angeles rejected the EIR because it was based on another environmental
report invalidated last year by a Northern California court. That report
set guidelines for divvying up state water among farms and developers.</LD>
<TE>Water Agency Left With 2 Options</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's ruling reversed a lower-court judgment in a lawsuit brought
against the Castaic Lake Water Agency by the Friends of the Santa Clara
River, a leading opponent of Newhall Ranch. In the suit, Los Angeles
Superior Court Judge David P. Yaffe found in favor of the water agency.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for the agency said it has two options: It can wait for
the approval of the EIR for the water-sharing guidelines, and rewrite the
Santa Clarita document accordingly, or it can draft a new EIR for water
imports from Kern County.</TE>
<TE>   Under the state water-sharing agreement, the Castaic agency plans to
buy 41,000 acre-feet per year from the Kern County Water Agency for
development projects in and around Santa Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 17,600 acre-feet Newhall Ranch will use per year, only 1,600
acre-feet will be imported water, according to a Los Angeles County
analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote on the Newhall
Ranch EIR on Jan 22. A spokesman for Supervisor Michael Antonovich, whose
district includes the Santa Clarita Valley, said it was unclear whether
Thursday's ruling would delay the vote.</TE>
<TE>Environmentalists Cite Growth Demands</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists contend the water agency cannot meet the demands of
Newhall Ranch without tapping the Santa Clara River and underground
sources in the Santa Clarita Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "This ruling [is] going to upset every action that affects water and
it will force a new environmental review," said Friends of the Santa
Clara River President Ron Bottorff.</TE>
<TE>   But Bob Clark, attorney for the Castaic agency, said, "Newhall Ranch
is not significantly dependent on the Castaic Lake Water Agency for its
water supply because it has developed significant other water resources."</TE>

<LD>A Cerritos man died Thursday after collapsing while surfing off San
Onofre State Beach, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Green, 28, was pronounced dead at San Clemente Hospital and
Medical Center shortly after 11 a.m., according to Joseph Luckey,
supervising deputy coroner for Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't know if he drowned or had a heart attack or what," Luckey
said.</LD>
<TE>   Green was surfing with a friend when he apparently slipped from his
board into the water while waiting for a wave, Luckey said.</TE>
<TE>   The friend, who has lifeguard training, managed to slide the
unconscious man back onto the board, pull him ashore and attempt to
revive him using CPR.</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy is scheduled today, Luckey said.</TE>

<HD>Rape Suspect to Face His Alleged Victims</HD>
<DH>Trial: Canoga Park man is charged with 11 felony counts involving
four women he met over the Internet.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A convicted sex offender, once cleared of rape when a judge ruled
that all sex with a prostitute is legal, sexually assaulted four women he
met over the Internet, a prosecutor said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Zabuski, 41, of Canoga Park is on trial in Pasadena on 11
felony counts, ranging from rape and attempted sodomy to assault, in
attacks on four women in Burbank and Canoga Park in October 1999 and
March 2000. Most of the counts are punishable by up to eight years in
state prison.</LD>
<LD>   Zabuski served nine years in prison for sexually assaulting two
teenage girls in 1990 while posing as a talent scout. He was released in
September 1999.</LD>
<TE>   In the current case, he was arrested in April 2000 on suspicion of
raping a Burbank woman. Three other women then filed criminal complaints
alleging he had also assaulted them, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Zabuski gained notoriety in 1986 when a Pasadena judge threw out
charges that he raped a prostitute, calling it "a breach of contract
between a whore and a trick."</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Gilbert C. Alston
said in an interview that "a woman who goes out on the street and makes a
whore out of herself . . . steps outside the protection of the law." His
remarks drew sharp criticism from feminists and legal commentators, but
Alston, who retired from the bench in 1991, was not disciplined.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Deputy Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Amy Suehiro told
jurors in her opening statement that all four alleged victims will
testify.</TE>
<TE>Defense Statement Scheduled for Today</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer James Barnes is expected to argue that his client had
consensual sex with each woman. He is scheduled to give his opening
statement today.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Terry Smerling has issued a
gag order forbidding the attorneys, police and witnesses from talking
about the case. The trial is expected to last at least four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   According to Suehiro's opening statement, the four women all met
Zabuski in chat rooms on the Internet, and he told at least one of them
that he was an L.A. Dodger.</TE>
<TE>   One of the women invited Zabuski to her room at the Quality Inn in
Burbank on March 10, 2000. It was their first face-to-face meeting.
There, Zabuski raped and sodomized her and forced her to perform oral
sex, Suehiro said. He also hit the woman and forced her into the bathtub,
where he urinated on her, the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   "She was threatened and she was hit by the defendant. She was in fear
of him," Suehiro said.</TE>
<TE>   Five days later, Zabuski went to the home of a Canoga Park woman, also
for their first personal encounter. She was similarly assaulted, Suehiro
said.</TE>
<TE>   Five days after that, another of the alleged victims went to Zabuski's
apartment, where he allegedly tried to sodomize her against her will.</TE>
<TE>   The two had met in a chat room for people interested in dominant and
submissive lifestyles, Suehiro said. The woman willingly performed oral
sex but did not consent to sodomy, Suehiro said.</TE>
<TE>   Zabuski set up a date with the fourth alleged victim for Oct. 1, 1999,
at his Canoga Park home.</TE>
<TE>   When she arrived, Zabuski immediately "socked her in the stomach for
being late," then sexually attacked her, Suehiro said.</TE>
<TE>   Two earlier victims also are expected to testify.</TE>
<TE>   The first woman met Zabuski in 1979 when he was a cadet with the San
Gabriel Police Department, working at the jail, and she had been arrested
on suspicion of driving under the influence, Suehiro said.</TE>
<TE>   Zabuski allegedly offered the woman an early release from jail in
exchange for sex in the lockup. She complied, the prosecutor said, but
was not released until the next day.</TE>
<TE>   "She will say she was tricked," Suehiro said.</TE>
<TE>   Zabuski was convicted in that case of bribery for demanding sexual
favors from inmates while working as a jailer.</TE>
<TE>   The other woman expected to testify got a call in 1990 from Zabuski,
posing as a casting director for a major studio, when she was 18, Suehiro
said. He had seen her name on a list of high school graduates in a local
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>Teen Was Molested in Parking Garage</TE>
<TE>   They met at a doughnut shop in South Pasadena and drove in his car to
the top of a parking garage in Pasadena, Suehiro said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the prosecutor, Zabuski told the young woman that because
she didn't belong to a union, she would have to star in an X-rated movie.
He then forced her to perform oral sex. She was one of the victims in his
1991 conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Zabuski was also convicted in 1983 of molesting a girl.</TE>

<HD>9 Arrested in Attacks at Garden Grove Cyber Cafe</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine people tied to Asian gangs have been arrested in connection
with violent attacks at a popular Garden Grove cyber cafe, including a
Dec. 30 incident in which a man was fatally stabbed in the head with a
screwdriver.</LD>
<LD>   Jim Hoang Nguyen, 21, of Irvine was arrested early Wednesday on
suspicion of killing Phuong Huu Ly, 20, who was stabbed at the PC Cafe in
the 9500 block of Garden Grove Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   Police also arrested eight teenagers--five boys and three girls--at
high schools in Westminster and Garden Grove for their alleged roles in a
Nov. 30 attack at the cyber cafe.</LD>
<TE>   That melee involved baseball bats and resulted in two serious
injuries, officers said.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests were "a matter of good police work and a lot of luck,"
said Sgt. Mike Handfield, a spokesman for the Garden Grove Police
Department.</TE>
<TE>   The names of the teenagers--all students at Bolsa Grande High School
in Garden Grove and La Quinta High School in Westminster--were not
released because of their ages. All are 16 or 17. They were taken to
Orange County Juvenile Hall, where they were booked on suspicion of
conspiracy and attempted murder.</TE>
<TE>   Handfield said police are seeking three other people in connection
with the fatal cafe attack.</TE>
<TE>   "They are members of a gang which we believe is a rival to the gang
the victim was associated with," Handfield said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the attacks, police have stepped up patrols at dozens of
late-night cyber cafes scattered around central Orange County. The cafes
have opened in Garden Grove and surrounding cities, bustling through the
night with teenagers who come to access the Internet and play video
games.</TE>

<HD>Teen Coffeehouse Has to Call It Quits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Koo's Cafe wanted to go legit after years of operating in a legal
gray area, but now the folksy, teen-oriented rock 'n' roll venue in
downtown Santa Ana is out of business because it can't afford the
improvements city officials require for a permit.</LD>
<LD>   Dennis Lluy, who founded the nonprofit, volunteer-staffed coffeehouse
7 1/2 years ago, says Koo's will try to reestablish itself soon in a
larger Santa Ana location more suited to the grass-roots touring bands
and emerging local musicians who play at the coffeehouse.</LD>
<LD>   Koo's has been occupying an aging wood-facade house in the 1500 block
of North Main Street. A 1997 victory in Municipal Court had enabled it to
operate without a city permit because of its nonprofit status. The $5 or
$6 optional admission charges were donations, a jury decided, and thus
the establishment was not subject to the usual city requirements for a
concert venue.</LD>
<TE>   Lluy came to agree that getting the city's official blessing, via a
conditional use permit, would be "the responsible thing." When he applied
for the permit in the fall, city officials estimated the cost at $650,
Lluy said.</TE>
<TE>   Once the permit process began, however, requirements began to pile up,
among them demands for a 35-car parking lot and improved drainage. The
cost could have run to $10,000, Lluy said--well beyond the means of
Koo's. Recently, he said, the Police Department notified him that Koo's
would be cited if it continued to put on shows without a permit. After a
final concert Jan. 2, the coffeehouse suspended operations.</TE>
<TE>   Koo's, which took its name from the Chinese restaurant that preceded
it at that location, has had its backers in city government, including
arts advocate and Planning Commissioner Don Cribb. They say it meets a
need for young people to enjoy music, poetry and occasional theater and
dance events in an alcohol-free environment. But Koo's also displeased
some neighbors who complained of noise and an overflow of music lovers
waiting to get into the club, whose capacity was 49.</TE>
<TE>   Lluy said Koo's organizers are searching for another venue, for
audiences of up to 150, that will meet city standards for a conditional
use permit without costly improvements.</TE>
<TE>   "We could play games with the city" and argue again that Koo's
nonprofit status means it shouldn't have to get a permit, Lluy said. "I
think we've matured beyond that point, and we want to take it to the next
step. We're looking to stay in Santa Ana, and the word I got is, the city
is interested in helping us."</TE>

<HD>El Toro Airport Foes Raise $750,200</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Measure W supporters say funds will be used for media
blitz. Opponents say they are just organizing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the primary election less than two months away, supporters of
the ballot measure that would kill the county's controversial plan for an
El Toro airport have raised more than $750,200 in campaign contributions.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers for the Yes on Measure W campaign raised $326,186 in the
last three months of 2001, said Bill Kogerman, chairman of Citizens for
Safe and Healthy Communities, which gathered signatures to place the
anti-airport initiative on the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   If approved by voters, Measure W would replace airport zoning at the
4,700-acre former Marine base with zoning for an urban park, university
complex and sports fields.</LD>
<TE>   "It's looking good at this point," Kogerman said. "We have a lot of
people very passionate about this issue and they're not going to stop
until there's a return to sanity in this process."</TE>
<TE>   Kogerman said the money will be used for television advertising,
posters and a direct-mail campaign: "Essentially the full media gamut."</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, the group leading the campaign in favor of the proposed
airport did not raise enough money to trigger campaign filing
requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Nestande, who chairs Citizens for Jobs and the Economy, which
has promoted an airport at El Toro since 1994, said that anti-Measure W
committee was recently formed but has not raised or spent $1,000, the
reporting threshold.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just forming our committee now," said Nestande, a former state
legislator and county supervisor. "We have begun our solicitation but we
have not raised money during the reporting period for this report."</TE>
<TE>   The group will be called the No On the Great Tax--Measure W, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among Orange County politicians, Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas raised
four times as much money in 2001 as his challenger, Senior Assistant
Dist. Atty. Wally Wade, campaign reports show.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas collected $206,000 in contributions, while Wade had
$48,000.</TE>
<TE>   Wade's campaign stands to benefit from a $70,000 pledge from a lawyers
union representing prosecutors, public defenders and county attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad has received $636,766 in
contributions thus far for her reelection campaign, nearly six times the
amount collected by challenger Chris Norby. From October through
December, Coad raised $65,079.</TE>
<TE>   Norby, a Fullerton councilman, has raised $121,300 so far, collecting
$78,100 in the last three months of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pleased, given [campaign contribution limits] and the challenge
to raise money against a multimillionaire incumbent," said Norby's
campaign manager, former state Sen. John Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Norby, who served three years as Fullerton mayor, opposes a commercial
airport at El Toro. Coad is a member of the board's pro-airport majority.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis was confident that Norby's anti-airport stance would resonate
not only in the district but also in south Orange County, where
anti-airport sentiment runs strong. Many of Norby's contributors were
from South County.</TE>

<HD>Valencia Site May House UCLA Film, TV Archive</HD>
<DH>Education: A nonprofit foundation plans to build the facility,
which would contain the collection now kept at four locations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the help of a wealthy film buff, UCLA is planning to
consolidate the country's second-largest media collection at a campus to
be built in Valencia, university officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed 60-acre site for the UCLA Film and Television Archive was
purchased by the Packard Humanities Institute, a nonprofit foundation in
Los Altos headed by computer heir David Packard. Escrow on the land,
bought from the Newhall Land and Farming Co., closed last month.</LD>
<LD>   The nonprofit plans to build a new UCLA Film and Television
Preservation Center on the site in the next few years to house the
archive's 27 million feet of newsreel footage and 220,000 films and TV
programs.</LD>
<TE>   The collection is currently spread among four sites on UCLA's Westwood
campus and at the old Technicolor building in Hollywood, on Cahuenga
Boulevard, archive officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The new facility would bring the collection together, and give its 63
employees a single, state-of-the-art place to work on film restoration
and preservation, said Tim Kittleson, the archive's director. It will
also host a new master's degree program in "moving image archiving
studies," which university officials said would be the first of its kind
in North America.</TE>
<TE>Scattered Collection Is Tough to Maintain</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a lot of wiggle room when it comes to space," Kittleson
said. "But when you try and maintain and conserve this collection, to
have it this [spread out] makes it very tough."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed campus will be at McBean Parkway and Rockwell Canyon
Road, between the CalArts campus and the two-year College of the Canyons.
A delighted Santa Clarita Mayor Frank Ferry on Thursday referred to the
site as "university row."</TE>
<TE>   Ferry praised UCLA's choice of Santa Clarita for the 17-year-old
archive, which is second in size to the Library of Congress in
Washington. The area is currently home to a number of post-production
companies and nearly 20 sound stages, and its rugged terrain has long
been a favorite locale for the old horse operas that the archive keeps.</TE>
<TE>   "We have such a history here," Ferry said. "Pictures were shot in
Santa Clarita back in the days of John Wayne and Glenn Ford."</TE>
<TE>   Packard, son of Hewlett-Packard computer pioneer Bill Packard, is a
former classics professor at UCLA who fell in love with old movies about
20 years ago and has likened early Hollywood output to the Greek
classics.</TE>
<TE>   He operates a vintage movie house in Palo Alto and purchased at least
2,500 silent films from Hollywood's Silent Movie Theater in the 1980s and
1990s for donation to the archive.</TE>
<TE>Packard Would Like Open Space Retained</TE>
<TE>   Reached by phone Thursday, Packard offered few details about the new
campus but said he'd like to see about three-quarters of it preserved as
open space. He says he is considering building a public screening room.</TE>
<TE>   "We should really talk about my true crusade," he said, "to get more
people to watch Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, not all of this new junk."</TE>

<LD>Ruling that the statute "does no such thing," a judge on Thursday
ordered Agoura Hills officials to delete voter guide language that says a
state law invalidates a city measure that would limit the size of new
retail stores.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge David P. Yaffe issued the order just as the city
was about to print the roughly 8,000 guides and sample ballots for the
March 5 election. The pamphlets will be rewritten.</LD>
<LD>   The disputed language was in the city's analysis of Measure H,
designed to block the construction of a 200,000-square-foot Home Depot.
The City Council supports the building project.</LD>
<TE>   City officials did not return phone calls about Yaffe's order.</TE>
<TE>   A representative for the Citizens for Responsible growth, which asked
for the order, said the city tried to mislead voters with the guide.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a baloney statement that we knew was a lie," said Al Abrams,
who heads the group. "It should be humiliating for a city council to be
caught by a superior court judge with their hands in the cookie jar."</TE>
<TE>   The group also disputed claims in the guide that Measure H would
prevent a Sport Chalet or Circuit City from opening in Agoura Hills. The
judge left that wording alone, saying voters could make their own
decision about the claims.</TE>
<TE>   Measure H would limit stores to 60,000 square feet. The state law
cited in the guide allows developers to seek variances to city zoning
restrictions. Yaffe ruled that Measure H would not preclude variances.</TE>

<HD>Coastal Plan Has Malibu Up in Arms</HD>
<DH>Land use: City leaders object to restrictions proposed by state
commissioners, who want to end lengthy lobbying sessions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Coastal Commission on Thursday moved to dump "Malibu
Days," the daylong sessions when state officials in charge of the entire
1,100-mile coastline get bogged down in home remodels, deck expansions
and other projects of Malibu's wealthy residents.</LD>
<LD>   Specifically, the commissioners unanimously adopted a draft coastal
development plan for Malibu, designed to force city officials to make the
tough calls and instruct property owners to scale back building plans
when they violate the state Coastal Act.</LD>
<LD>   If all goes as state leaders hope, Malibu's rich and powerful will
stop lobbying in Sacramento every time the Coastal Commission threatens
to turn down a new sea wall or deck expansion.</LD>
<TE>   Yet Malibu leaders strenuously objected to many parts of the
commission's local coastal plan, which lays out development policies for
the city's 27 miles of coastline.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Jennings, Malibu's mayor pro tem, said the plan is too
inflexible, too broad in some areas and too narrow in others. As a
result, he said, the city may be forced to sue to preserve its options.</TE>
<TE>   City leaders and property-rights advocates have objected to reining in
new homes to 10,000 square feet and forcing some property owners to make
a choice on amenities: build a swimming pool or a tennis court, but not
both.</TE>
<TE>   They don't like the commission's zoning restrictions or definitions of
sensitive habitat, which could prevent some types of development and cut
back others.</TE>
<TE>   They take issue with the commission's goals of opening access ways
every 1,000 feet to allow the public to reach beaches that are blocked by
shoulder-to-shoulder oceanfront homes.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, they asked the commission to postpone any action so that city
leaders could negotiate a more palatable plan.</TE>
<TE>   "All we are asking is a reasonable opportunity to present you the
issues in an orderly manner," Jennings said.</TE>
<TE>   But commissioners said they faced a tight deadline imposed by state
law.</TE>
<TE>   "We are under a very, very short timeline," said Sara Wan, the Coastal
Commission's chairwoman. "It's time to move forward."</TE>
<TE>   The commission was acting on orders of Senate President Pro Tem John
Burton (D-San Francisco), Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks)
and Gov. Gray Davis, who have grown weary of the lobbying by Malibu's
elite. Each of these three leaders appoints one-third of the 12-member
commission.</TE>
<TE>   These three leaders last year pushed through a law that ordered the
commission to do something that Malibu has failed to do in its decade as
an incorporated city: draw up a local coastal plan. The law required the
commission to submit a draft to the city by Tuesday and iron out final
implementing rules by Sept. 15.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor and the leadership of both houses wanted to get away
from the drain on the Coastal Commission's time and eliminate a source of
a huge amount of bad feelings because they are acting as the neighborhood
zoning board," said Mary Nichols, the governor's secretary of resources.</TE>
<TE>   The Coastal Act passed in 1976 requires cities and counties to adopt
local coastal plans to provide a blueprint for development. A number of
local governments have never done so. But none has created as much
work--and ill feelings--for the commission as Malibu, which has a rare
combination of rugged beauty, sensitive habitat and development pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Letters demonizing the commission have poured in from Malibu, several
likening it to the British Empire at the time of the American Revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Malibu Planning Commissioner Ted Vaill, for instance, noted that he is
a descendant of a Revolutionary War hero who led the Green Mountain Boys
to take a British garrison. "I am thinking of forming the Santa Monica
Mountain Boys (and Girls) to protect the interests of the residents of
Malibu from outsiders," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The most boisterous reaction during Thursday's daylong public hearing
was over the plan to remove soccer fields and baseball diamonds at Malibu
Bluffs State Park.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Parks and Recreation, which owns the
bluffs, wants to restore the natural vegetation for hikers and
picnickers. It wants to put a visitors' center there, as a gateway to
state and federal parkland in the Santa Monica Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The Coastal Commission allowed the playing fields to be built there
temporarily in the 1980s, until local officials could find another site
for them. More than 15 years later, local officials have yet to find an
alternative site, although they are in negotiations with a neighboring
landowner.</TE>
<TE>   During the public hearing, more than 50 youth soccer players and
Little Leaguers in uniform urged commissioners not to take away their
ballparks.</TE>
<TE>   "Could you please save the Bluffs Park," begged Ryan O'Neill. "I
wouldn't be able to practice without the park."</TE>
<TE>   Wan assured the children that the new policy would not rob them of
playing fields. "Contrary to what you've been told," Wan said, "No one
will cut off your fields until others are found. No one is going to take
your fields away."</TE>
<TE>   The adults were more likely to take issue with the commission's
designation of most of Malibu's remaining open space as sensitive
habitat, crucial to the survival of many rare species. Properties in
these areas are subject to tougher building restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   They also bickered over the commission's strategy to limit sea walls
being used to protect oceanfront homes and plans to clean up leaky septic
tanks that continue to foul Malibu's beaches.</TE>
<TE>   Malibu leaders feared that the commission's adoption of the plan would
leave no room for alterations, even if they can mount a persuasive case
for changes.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Douglas, the commission's executive director, said such fears
are unfounded. "It's not done until it's done," he said. "I don't
understand what all of the fuss is about."</TE>

<HD>San Diego Symphony Receives Record Donation</HD>
<DH>Endowment: The gift from Qualcomm's chief executive and his wife is
said to be significantly larger than $40 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Diego Symphony officials on Monday will announce the largest
single gift ever to an American orchestra, a donation from Qualcomm Chief
Executive Irwin M. Jacobs and his wife, Joan K. Jacobs, that sources say
will be "significantly larger" than $40 million.</LD>
<LD>   Symphony officials, who plan to reveal the gift and launch an
endowment campaign in a ceremony at Copley Symphony Hall, said they were
delaying release of further details in deference to the Jacobses, who are
returning this weekend from a business trip to Asia.</LD>
<LD>   The San Diego Union-Tribune, citing unnamed sources, hinted Wednesday
that the gift could be as much as $100 million. A publicist close to
Qualcomm and the symphony, Emile Barrios, vice president of the Townsend
Agency, labeled the $100-million figure "speculation." But he said the
gift definitely would top $40 million, a prediction symphony officials
did not challenge.</LD>
<TE>   That figure is significant, said Jack McAuliffe, vice president of the
New York-based American Symphony Orchestra League, because it is the
benchmark in single gifts to orchestras.</TE>
<TE>   In November 1996, the family of Carnival Cruise Lines founder Ted
Arison gave that amount in stock to the Miami Beach-based New World
Symphony. In December 2000, the family of Enterprise Rent-A-Car founder
Jack Taylor donated the same sum to the St. Louis Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   If the Jacobs gift "is what it's rumored to be, it's a very nice day
for San Diego," McAuliffe said.</TE>
<TE>   The money is earmarked for the symphony's endowment fund. For the
orchestra, which reorganized under bankruptcy protection in 1996, the
announcement accelerates a striking recovery after decades of tenuous
finances.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly is a new world for us," said Douglas Gerhard, the
orchestra's chief executive since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The symphony's current $8.8-million annual budget, generated from
donations, grants and ticket sales, puts it among the nation's 40 largest
orchestras. Its endowment is only about $1 million, a figure dwarfed by
the $200-million nest eggs enjoyed by such established orchestras as the
New York Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the San
Francisco Symphony. (The Los Angeles Philharmonic, on the brink of
launching an endowment drive, has about $54.4 million.) Endowments are
invested and viewed as indicators of financial stability; their earnings
go toward operating expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego orchestra's already improving finances allowed it to
sign a five-year contract in October that gradually extends the
musicians' season from 26 to 41 weeks and boosts base salaries from
$27,000 to $45,750.</TE>
<TE>   Gerhard, who declined to comment on the size of the gift, said, "We're
going through a long-range planning process even as we speak."</TE>
<TE>   Atop his list is a musical director to succeed Jung-Ho Pak, who is due
to step down in May at the end of the 2001-02 season. Gerhard said he and
his colleagues are considering about 20 candidates and expect Monday's
disclosures to help San Diego "put its best foot forward" in courting
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, he said, he expects to see "a much more active symphony,
performing more concerts, particularly more classical concerts" as
opposed to pops concerts. Pops concerts, which tend to draw larger crowds
with more familiar, less adventurous repertory, now amount to about 45%
of the orchestra's performances.</TE>
<TE>   Because the organization would only be able to spend the gift's annual
earnings, not the principal, McAuliffe said, "they can't waste it.</TE>
<TE>   "It is going to provide some fiscal security, and that allows you to
take a few artistic risks, without fear of having to turn out the lights
afterward."</TE>
<TE>   For the Jacobs family, the gift is the largest gesture so far in an
already expansive philanthropic career. Irwin M. Jacobs, a 68-year-old
former Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and one of the
earliest faculty members recruited to the University of California's new
San Diego campus in 1966, went on to co-found Qualcomm in 1985 and has
steered the wireless communications company to global prominence and $2.7
billion in annual revenue.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, San Diego's city-owned stadium, home to the Padres and
Chargers, took on the name Qualcomm Stadium (at least through 2017) after
Jacobs' company agreed to pay $18 million to complete an expansion
project.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the Jacobses donated $15 million to UC San Diego's
engineering school, which was renamed in their honor.</TE>
<TE>   Their involvement with the symphony goes back many years. In 1993, the
couple contributed $500,000 for improvements to Copley Hall. And this
November they offered the orchestra a matching grant of $300,000 in a bid
to spur donations from other backers.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the times that we live in, they wanted to be sure that the San
Diego community continued to be responsive to the symphony's needs," said
Gerhard, who noted that the $300,000 was matched in about two weeks.</TE>

<HD>Davis, Riordan Rake In Donations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<AU>DOUG SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis collected almost $6 million in contributions for
his reelection effort in the last three months of 2001, leaving him with
more than $35.4 million on hand to wage his campaign. Former Los Angeles
Mayor Richard Riordan easily eclipsed his Republican counterparts by
raising nearly $4 million in the last quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Campaign contribution reports filed Thursday show the magnitude of
Riordan's fund-raising advantage over businessman Bill Simon Jr. and
Secretary of State Bill Jones.</LD>
<LD>   While Riordan had $3.8 million in his campaign treasury at the end of
the year, Simon was forced to tap his personal fortune to remain a viable
contender. He lent his campaign almost $1.7 million on Dec. 28 to boost
his cash on hand to $2.8 million.</LD>
<TE>   Apart from his own donations, Simon raised only $278,000 from
contributors in three months.</TE>
<TE>   Although Jones is the only Republican to hold a statewide office, he
ran a distant third in fund-raising, netting little more than $431,600
after repaying some loans. He had $1.01 million left in his campaign
treasury, enough to pay for about a week of television ads at the rate
needed to have an impact on the state's voters.</TE>
<TE>   But almost a third of the cash in his war chest consists of loans,
including $200,000 that Jones lent to his own campaign on New Year's Eve,
the end of the reporting period. He also received loans of $100,000 from
Madera rancher Price Giffen and $35,000 from two Assembly members.</TE>
<TE>   The latest campaign reports show that Riordan, after two terms as
mayor of the state's largest city, has made a rapid transition to
statewide fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with the resources to buy television time, Riordan this week
became the first of the Republican candidates to run TV commercials.
Broadcast advertising is the biggest expense for candidates running in
far-flung California.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is you need to get the money to get the paid time on
TV," said Bruce Cain, head of the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC
Berkeley. "TV is the weapon of choice, and TV is expensive."</TE>
<TE>   Cain said that without substantially more money, Jones' and Simon's
visibility will recede behind Riordan, who already is better known than
his GOP compatriots.</TE>
<TE>   If Jones--who unlike Simon does not have personal millions at his
disposal--cannot raise more money, his "candidacy is dead in the water,"
Cain said.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's campaign team noted that his $4-million take did not include
a check from the candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pleased with our fund-raising progress," said Kevin Spillane,
political director of the former mayor's effort. "It's another sign that
the Riordan campaign is on track and moving forward very successfully."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's largest single contribution during the last three months
came from the association that represents state attorneys, administrative
law judges and hearing officers. The group gave $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   San Mateo-based software company Siebel Systems Inc. and a Siebel
family trust donated $200,000 to Riordan. Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger
gave $50,000, and Roy E. Disney, vice chairman of Walt Disney Co., and
his wife, Patricia, each gave $45,000.</TE>
<TE>   Sal Russo, Simon's campaign strategist, said the secretary of state's
fund-raising was hampered by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He predicted
that the pace of contributions will increase in the weeks ahead as former
New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani helps raise money.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to Riordan's powerful fund-raising, Simon's biggest donors
wrote much smaller checks. Developer A.G. Spanos gave $25,000. New York
businessman Paul Singer and Thousand Oaks retiree Elizabeth Grossman were
among only eight contributors of $10,000 or more.</TE>
<TE>   With his latest loan, Simon has lent his campaign almost $2.28
million.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the slow pace of Jones' contributions at the end of last year,
campaign spokesman Sean Walsh expressed the hope that upcoming events
will raise enough money to allow the GOP candidate to buy television
time.</TE>
<TE>   The largest donor to Jones' campaign during the period was California
Casualty Management Co., which gave $50,000. The biometrics company Pelco
Inc. in Clovis contributed $30,000. Reno Contracting Inc. and Pacific
West Pharmacy in Placer County each gave $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   Overshadowing the entire field was Davis, who has been raising funds
for his reelection campaign almost since he was elected to his first term
as governor.</TE>
<TE>   The Democrat's biggest contributors in the last quarter include labor
unions. The Service Employees International Union gave $150,000. The
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union added
more than $101,600 to Davis' bulging campaign treasury.</TE>
<TE>   Davis received $100,000 each from Univision Chairman Jerry Perenchio,
the Morongo Band of Mission Indians, Beverly Hills-based developer Casden
Properties and screenwriter Stephen Bing. The governor's campaign also
collected $50,000 or more from development, biotech, construction,
investment, insurance, oil and cable television companies.</TE>

<HD>Even After 9/11, Vehicle's Size Matters</HD>

<LD>Not global warming, not sticker shock, not even addiction to
foreign oil, seem to have chilled interest in Dumbo-size vehicles at the
Greater Los Angeles Auto Show.</LD>
<LD>   A small electric car, called Think, was almost crushed by the stampede
heading for the likes of Ford's new lineup of SUVs and the luxurious 2003
Lincoln Navigator, described as even bigger than last year's model.</LD>
<LD>   Cooing from atop a revolving stage, an attractive spokesmodel said the
Navigator's 300-horsepower engine is big enough to pull a large boat or
horse trailer.</LD>
<TE>   I asked a Lincoln rep if he gets many questions about mileage, and he
looked at me as if I'd been drinking.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think someone who spends $55,000 on an SUV is going to worry
about mileage?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Good point.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't heard one person mention Sept. 11 as a factor in deciding
what kind of car to buy," a Ford representative told me, and my own
research backed him up.</TE>
<TE>   John McNamara, a San Fernando Valley general contractor who owns five
SUVs, gazed admiringly at a $45,000 Ford Excursion that is the
approximate size of the Love Boat. This thing is so humongous--more than
8,500 pounds--Ford is not even required to divulge how many miles per
gallon it gets.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we get about 11," said McNamara, who has a 2001 Excursion.</TE>
<TE>   "Twelve," said his wife, T.C., who added, "I've had people yelling at
me at the gas station because it takes forever to fill the 44-gallon
tank."</TE>
<TE>   The Excursion was parked next to an Explorer that gets 14 mpg in the
city and 19 on the highway. A Ford rep said the company sells far more of
the mid-size Explorers than the larger Excursion.</TE>
<TE>   But the McNamaras favor the biggest of the big, and John explained
why.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd be in a smaller SUV and bigger vehicles would pull up alongside
us, and I felt intimidated. I'm interested in keeping my family safe."</TE>
<TE>   And he believes in buying American, which McNamara equates with
patriotism. He singled out Japanese cars, in particular, as vehicles he
would never own.</TE>
<TE>   I did not press him on whether it's patriotic to burn vast quantities
of Saudi oil, even though that country produced and harbored many of the
terrorists involved in the Sept. 11 attacks on America.</TE>
<TE>   And it seemed prudent, under the circumstances, to withhold
information about my Japanese car. The new model Nissan Sentra, slightly
larger than a splat on an Excursion windshield, was pushed so far to the
rear of the showroom, it was almost out the door and onto the shoulder of
the Santa Monica Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The McNamaras said they'd certainly prefer large vehicles that got
better mileage, but as Mr. McNamara put it, the world is going to run out
of fossil fuel regardless of what he's driving.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration, which has seemed intent on making this happen
sooner than later, broke news Wednesday on this very subject. The White
House dumped a government project to develop gas-powered vehicles that
get 80 mpg. The car of the future, according to the Bush team, is a
hydrogen-powered model.</TE>
<TE>   If the pipe dream ever becomes reality, it could be great for the
environment. But critics say the hurdles are so numerous and the
technology so undeveloped, it could take decades to put such a car on the
market.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, auto makers, which have spent a fortune lobbying
against higher mileage requirements, are off the hook even though average
mileage has hit a 21-year low. That's because for the first time ever,
more people are buying trucks and SUVs than regular passenger cars.</TE>
<TE>   After another fan of the Excursion told me he needs a vehicle "big
enough to carry my wife, three kids and the living room," I wandered over
to the electric Th!nk, which could probably fit in the Excursion's cargo
hold.</TE>
<TE>   The Th!ink is made by Ford, and Ford rep Tom Bastianelli said it can
go about 50 miles on $1 worth of electricity. You can recharge it in four
to six hours by plugging it into a wall socket, but it won't be on the
market until later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Bastianelli said there were more clean cars downstairs, so I made my
way to the basement, only to get lost. Auto parts displays, car-themed
gifts, guys with NASCAR T-shirts, and a truck sitting atop tires the size
of Ferris wheels, served as reminders that I was not attending a global
warming convention. Finally, in the back corner, I found what I was
looking for.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of a purring spokesmodel, there's a science guy in khakis
pitching the electric, gas/electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell
vehicles. Ryan Fitzgerald, of the Electric Vehicle Assn. of the Americas,
wasn't getting the foot traffic I saw upstairs, but there was a steady
trickle that picked up after Bush's new strategy hit the news.</TE>
<TE>   Something tells me it'll be many a moon before a knockout spokesmodel
slinks across a revolving stage at the car show, holds up an extension
cord, and tells a fawning crowd that the Th!nk takes only four hours to
recharge.</TE>
<TE>   But there were more alternative-fuel vehicles at this year's show than
ever before, said Fitzgerald. And anybody who cares about national
security, fuel economy and the environment, can reach only one
conclusion, according to him.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the future."</TE>

<HD>State Sues Parent of Troubled PG&amp;E</HD>
<DH>Energy: The attorney general accuses the firm of illegally
funneling billions from the utility. The corporation says it will prevail
in court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer filed a lawsuit Thursday against
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Corp., the parent of PG&amp;E Co., that seeks the
return of as much as $4 billion Lockyer says was illegally siphoned from
the state's largest utility, driving it into bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   The Superior Court suit alleges that PG&amp;E Corp. violated agreements
with state regulators that were designed to protect PG&amp;E Co. and its
Northern and Central California customers when the giant holding company
was formed five years ago.</LD>
<LD>   "Those promises have been consistently and repeatedly broken," Lockyer
told a news conference in Oakland. "When you follow the money between the
child and the parent, you find all the money went from the child to the
parent. Not a nickel went to try to rescue the child."</LD>
<TE>   The civil suit, alleging fraudulent and deceptive business practices,
was hailed by state regulators and consumer advocates. It is the first
major legal action by the attorney general in the ongoing state
investigations into the energy crisis and whether power providers
illegally profited from it.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer said that he has not ruled out criminal charges but that his
first priority is recouping $600 million to $4 billion for PG&amp;E
ratepayers. The suit also seeks penalties for each alleged improper
transfer of funds, which Lockyer says could amount to at least $500
million for the state coffers.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E Corp. issued a statement calling the suit "unwarranted,
discriminatory and harmful to California" and saying that the company
expects to prevail in court.</TE>
<TE>   The corporation said the transfers from its San Francisco-based
utility have been repeatedly audited by state regulators, with no
indication of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "Since there is no basis for another review of these same events, the
attorney general's complaint . . . appears to be more related to his
ongoing efforts to obstruct our utility's plans for emerging from
bankruptcy."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit opens a new front in the continuing battle between PG&amp;E
and the state. The utility filed for protection from creditors in federal
Bankruptcy Court in April, then proposed a controversial reorganization
plan that shifts its transmission and generation assets to new
subsidiaries of its parent company.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general and the state Public Utilities Commission have
moved in Bankruptcy Court to block PG&amp;E's plan, calling it an attempt to
escape state regulation and bolster its profits on the backs of
ratepayers. The PUC this week asked the judge for permission to submit an
alternate plan that it is developing.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit names PG&amp;E President and Chief Executive Robert Glynn Jr.
and other top officials, many of whom hold positions at both the utility
and the parent company. It alleges that they conspired to use ratepayer
money and other PG&amp;E assets "to cross-subsidize PG&amp;E Corp. and other
subsidiaries . . . as part of a plan to evade the PUC's regulatory
authority . . . and make PG&amp;E Corp. one of the largest unregulated
generating companies in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Their actions, the suit said, violated some of the nearly two dozen
conditions under which the PUC allowed PG&amp;E to form a holding company in
1996 during the early days of deregulation of wholesale energy markets.
One condition said the capital requirements of PG&amp;E would be given "first
priority" by the corporation.</TE>
<TE>   However, the suit said the money flowed in only one direction--to the
parent company--even when PG&amp;E was unable to cover the costs of providing
power to its customers during the energy crisis and was plunging into
debt.</TE>
<TE>   From 1997 through the summer of 2000, the suit said, the utility
provided $4.6 billion to its parent in the form of repurchases of PG&amp;E
common stock and of $1.76 billion in shareholder dividends.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also said PG&amp;E paid its parent hundreds of millions dollars
more than the utility's share of the income taxes that were due.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 2000, PG&amp;E sought emergency rate increases from the
PUC. But in the first nine months of that year, the suit said, the
utility transferred $632 million of the $1.8 billion it generated to its
parent.</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleged that the corporation failed to abide by its agreement
with the PUC to assist the utility although it had cash reserves of about
$307 million on Dec. 29, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC paved the way Wednesday for Lockyer's suit by defining the
extent to which the holding company must give first priority to the
financial needs of the utility. For one thing, the PUC ruled, the holding
company is prohibited from acquiring assets of the utility for inadequate
consideration.</TE>
<TE>   "I am pleased that Atty. Gen. Lockyer has acted promptly to follow up
on the commission's actions yesterday, which provided a basis to claim
that PG&amp;E Corp. is violating conditions established by the commission
when it authorized [the holding company]," PUC President Loretta M. Lynch
said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch said the PUC, which launched an inquiry into the holding company
transactions last year, may join the attorney general's suit or file a
separate one over any violations of the Public Utilities Code and
commission rules.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general's lawsuit named PG&amp;E Corp., but not the utility.
Clark Kelso, director of the government and public policy program at the
McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, said that may help Lockyer avoid
federal Bankruptcy Court jurisdiction, which would not apply to the
corporation because it is not in bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Kelso said the suit may increase pressure for an agreement to resolve
the bankruptcy case. "There are lots of things in play now," he said. "It
would be a good time for all parties to see if there is a way to adjust
the [reorganization] plan to be acceptable for everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Finkelstein, supervising attorney for the Utility Reform Network,
lauded the suit, saying: "This is potentially very good news for
California consumers and especially PG&amp;E customers. It is very
encouraging to see someone trying to reverse what has been a massive flow
of money from the utility up to the holding company. . . . They tried to
have it both ways: 'What's yours is mine, and what's mine is going to
stay mine.' "</TE>

<HD>Closure of Brothel Next to School Ends Protesters' Decades-Long
Fight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inside the Swedish Salon massage parlor a sign warned prostitutes
not to parade outdoors in skimpy clothes because "school was back in
session."</LD>
<LD>   For three decades, a chain-link fence is all that separated the
children at Pomona's Abraham Lincoln Elementary School from the parlor.</LD>
<LD>   Youngsters with curious eyes would sometimes get an early lesson in
sex education. School officials said condoms and crumpled pornographic
magazines would blow across the playground on the campus, which surrounds
the brothel on three sides.</LD>
<TE>   Not anymore. The house of ill repute is now closed, and the land at
1293 N. Garey Ave. will be turned over to the school.</TE>
<TE>   "It is rare as a prosecutor you can do something so positive for the
community," said Gail Ehrlich, the deputy district attorney who
prosecuted the case.</TE>
<TE>   Owners Herschel H. Jennings, 65, of Alta Loma and his wife, Kay, 64,
of Apple Valley agreed to give up the salon masquerading as a massage
parlor and pleaded no contest Wednesday to a handful of
prostitution-related charges. In return, the prosecutor agreed to dismiss
multiple charges of conspiracy, pimping and tax evasion involving two
businesses, the Garey salon and the Pomona Valley Health Spa.</TE>
<TE>   A sign saying "MASSAGE Swedish Salon" outside the stucco bungalow
greets motorists on the San Bernardino Freeway going toward downtown
Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is a victory for the entire city," said Pomona Mayor Eddie
Cortez. "It's been an ongoing problem for 25 years, since my children
attended the school. I've had grandchildren and great-grandchildren
attend the school."</TE>
<TE>   Cortez, elected in 1993, said that before he was mayor he was a parent
and grandparent picketing and protesting the salon.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried every kind of protest to get them to leave," he said. "It
will be an honor to knock the place down."</TE>
<TE>   Cortez said the owners even "tried to lie and say I was a former
customer. But I wasn't about to back off."</TE>
<TE>   Pomona Unified board President Nancy McCracken said: "The children at
Lincoln couldn't get a better gift for the new year. It wasn't an easy
neighbor to have. The first thing the school custodian did every day was
clear the playground of the tools of the trade that would float over the
fence."</TE>
<TE>   When the Swedish Salon opened in 1971, the school was a short distance
from it. But community objections grew over the years as the school added
a parking lot and playgrounds that moved children closer and closer to
the business. One Lincoln principal seeking to shield youngsters added
black strips of plastic to the chain-link fence, school officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It took a very creative prosecutor and smart bunch of [Pomona police]
detectives to do what their predecessors could not, and shut the salon
down for good," said McCracken, a 20-year school board member and Lincoln
graduate. "Everyone knew it was there. But no one managed to prove it."</TE>
<TE>   After a yearlong police investigation, a county grand jury indicted
the couple in February on multiple counts of conspiracy, pimping and tax
evasion.</TE>
<TE>   Ehrlich said the investigation was more comprehensive than most
efforts to stop prostitution.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, police send undercover officers as customers and arrest
prostitutes, she said. But the Swedish Salon's elaborate member
registration made it difficult for police to make arrests.</TE>
<TE>   To make the case, detectives performed surveillance and served
extensive search warrants on the businesses, the couple's homes and their
bank accounts, which uncovered piles of cash and revealing documents.</TE>
<TE>   "We found a way to attack houses of prostitution and actually close
them down," said Det. Fred Robison, who led the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Ehrlich said investigators, with the help of the state Franchise Tax
Board, were able to determine tax evasion based on the prostitutes' tax
returns.</TE>
<TE>   Of the $50 charge, prostitutes received $5 while the Jennings kept
$45, she said. The women also accepted tips that could be as much as the
base price.</TE>
<TE>   The business "made millions [of dollars] over the years," Ehrlich
said.</TE>
<TE>   Customers and prostitutes testified before the grand jury during a
monthlong hearing, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Kay Jennings' attorney, Richard Beada, said his client did what was in
her best interests.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got a little old man and a little old lady who've been running
a business for 30 years, and they've now been forced out of business by
government," he said. "You think they survived by accident? It's human
nature. People frequent these places and always will. It's part of life."</TE>
<TE>   The couple are scheduled to be sentenced March 22. Under the terms of
the plea agreement, they must pay $59,400 to the Franchise Tax Board in
back taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Herschel Jennings will receive a three-year suspended state sentence
and one year in jail. His wife will perform 1,000 hours of community
service.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, they will keep the Pomona Valley Spa building, at
1567 N. Orange Grove Ave.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of the nature of the convictions, they won't be even able to
run a legal massage parlor," Ehrlich said. "They are out of business."</TE>

<HD>2 JDL Leaders Are Indicted by U.S. Grand Jury</HD>
<DH>Crime: Irv Rubin, Earl Krugel are accused of plotting to blow up a
Culver City mosque and a congressman's office.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal grand jury indicted leaders of the militant Jewish
Defense League on Thursday on charges of plotting to bomb the Muslim
Public Affairs Council in Los Angeles, the King Fahd mosque in Culver
City and a field office of U.S. Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista).</LD>
<LD>   Irv Rubin, the JDL's national chairman, and Earl Krugel, the group's
West Coast coordinator, could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted
on the most serious charges in the nine-count indictment.</LD>
<LD>   The pair, arrested by the FBI last month, were charged with conspiring
to use a weapon of mass destruction against a U.S. government office,
which carries a maximum life term.</LD>
<TE>   They also face charges of conspiracy, possession of a destructive
device, attempted arson, possession of illegal weapons, and soliciting
another JDL member to carry out the bombings.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers said the charges are overblown, and they accused
prosecutors of succumbing to hysteria after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment outlined the roles that Rubin and Krugel allegedly
played in the plot, and offered new details about the events that
culminated in their arrest Dec. 11. That came after a JDL member who
became an FBI informant delivered five pounds of explosive powder to
Krugel's home in Reseda.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin, it said, chose the locations to be bombed and decided when the
attacks would occur.</TE>
<TE>   Krugel, his second in command, recruited the putative bomber and sent
him on shopping trips to buy the metal pipes and explosive powder that
would be used to build the bombs in Krugel's garage, according to the
indictment.</TE>
<TE>   The informant, described only as someone who joined the JDL in his
teens, told investigators that he was recruited during a meeting with
Rubin and Krugel on Oct. 19 in which the two leaders discussed their
intention to bomb buildings "associated with Arab religious or political
institutions."</TE>
<TE>   Rubin, the indictment said, wanted to target the Muslim Public Affairs
Council, which has an office in a high-rise in the mid-Wilshire district,
while Krugel had a list of mosques throughout the Los Angeles area.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward--the exact date has not been disclosed--authorities said,
the JDL recruit contacted the FBI and agreed to wear a concealed tape
recorder during future contacts with Krugel and Rubin.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment gave this chronology of subsequent meetings:</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 29, Krugel instructed the informant to take photographs of the
Muslim Public Affairs Council to determine the best way to bomb its
offices.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 4, Krugel told the informant they could build the bomb in his
garage. He advised the informant to carry it to the Muslim Public Affairs
Council office in a paper bag to avoid attracting attention.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 8, Krugel told the informant what brand of gunpowder to buy
and promised to show him what type of pipe to purchase.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 14, Krugel advised the informant to use gloves when handling
the bomb materials to avoid leaving fingerprints.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 7, Krugel made plans to go shopping with the informant for the
bomb components, telling him that Dec. 13 was the target date for bombing
the Muslim Public Affairs Council. Krugel said, however, that Rubin had
the final say.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 11, Rubin changed the plan, telling the informant he wanted
him to bomb the King Fahd mosque in Culver City and Issa's field office.
Investigators believe Issa's San Clemente office was the target. At the
same meeting, Krugel told the informant to deliver the explosive powder
to his home later that day.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents arrested Rubin and Krugel soon after the informant dropped
off the gunpowder.</TE>
<TE>   Krugel's lawyer, Mark Werksman, called the charges "overblown."
Referring to Sept. 11, Werksman said, "This indictment is being brought
under a cloud of hysteria which has impaired the judgment of law
enforcement and the prosecution."</TE>
<TE>   Krugel and Rubin, who are being held in solitary confinement at the
federal detention center in Los Angeles, will be arraigned Jan. 22 in
U.S. District Court, according to Assistant U.S. Atty. Gregory Jessner.</TE>

<HD>Parks Upbeat on His 4 Years as Police Chief</HD>
<DH>Politics: He says crime has been cut during his tenure and racial,
gender diversity improved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With his first term as Los Angeles police chief drawing to a close,
and the question of his possible reappointment still up in the air,
Bernard C. Parks held a news conference Thursday to tout the
accomplishments of his past four years, focusing on crime trends, crime
prevention and reform efforts.</LD>
<LD>   Flanked by officers and his command staff, Parks presented his
fourth-year-in-office report in front of Parker Center.</LD>
<LD>   He said he wanted to inform the public about changes within the
department, but he also made little attempt to conceal the significance
of the news conference--in part, a sweeping self-appraisal--to the
political drama fast unfolding over his future.</LD>
<TE>   Parks even alluded to the reappointment process in his closing
statements, suggesting that he will publicly announce his decision on
whether to seek a second term in early February.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Commission, consisting of mayoral appointees, would have
three months to support or oppose his reappointment, subject to a City
Council veto. Mayor James K. Hahn has not yet said publicly whether he
supports the chief's reappointment, which is hotly opposed by the Police
Protective League, the union representing rank-and-file officers.</TE>
<TE>   League leaders are concerned that officer morale has plummeted under
Parks' leadership, and say the problem is so severe it affects the
department's ability to function.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging recent increases in crime, Parks argued that long-term
trends show that crime is still below the levels of the four years
preceding his tenure. He argued that homicide levels have declined 43.9%
in his four-year term, compared to the four years before 1997. Assaults
also have dropped by 17.9%.</TE>
<TE>   "In order to get a true picture of crime, we must view crime trends
over an extended period of time. . . . You cannot look at crime in
snippets," Parks said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 584 people were killed in Los Angeles, an increase of about
6% from 2000. The number represents the second year of increases, but is
about half the record high of 1,096, set in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Parks also touted his accomplishments in increasing racial and gender
diversity among officers, raising disciplinary standards throughout the
department, conducting a board of inquiry into the Rampart corruption
scandal to address the department's failings, and implementing the myriad
reforms of 10 different task forces and study groups.</TE>
<TE>   Department public affairs officers handed out colored pamphlets
adorned with an American-flag graphic motif and photographs of the
smiling chief.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by one reporter about the union's concerns, Parks was explicit:
"We do not talk about anything negative at our news conferences," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Salesman Hahn Calls on Valley With Hard Anti-Secession Pitch</HD>
<DH>Politics: The mayor vows to take care of business and says he'll
make weekly visits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn traveled to the San Fernando Valley
on Thursday to make the first of what his aides say will be weekly visits
to Valley neighborhoods, where some residents have been advocating
secession from the city.</LD>
<LD>   The mayor's visit coincides with a stepped-up effort by his
administration, in public events and behind-the-scenes politicking, to
head off the drive for a breakup.</LD>
<LD>   "I want my customers to stay part of the city of Los Angeles, and I
think I demonstrate that by service," Hahn said during a visit to the
Valley Economic Development Center in Van Nuys, comparing City Hall to a
business.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn's appearance came a day after a commission studying the viability
of secession confirmed that it would be financially feasible to create a
new city in the Valley. Since his campaign, the mayor has vowed to fight
efforts to break apart Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn is coupling his visits to the Valley with a political strategy
designed to dampen enthusiasm for secession and win backers for a
possible campaign against it.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, he met with Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman
Oaks), who has been discussed as a possible candidate for mayor of a new
Valley city, and asked him to support his efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The speaker told the mayor he is willing to help Hahn address the
concerns of frustrated residents, but declined to join Hahn in opposing
secession, said Luke Breit, a spokesman for Hertzberg.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, political consultant Bill Carrick said he and other Hahn
advisors this month will begin reaching out to potential contributors in
their effort to raise $5 million, to be used to defeat a secession
initiative that may be placed on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. United, the political action committee Hahn formed to oppose a
ballot initiative, recently hired as a fund-raiser Annette Castro, former
aide to then-City Councilman Richard Alarcon.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn won his office with significant support in the Valley and has
made frequent appearances there since taking office in July. But during
the coming months he plans to be even more visible, said Deputy Mayor
Matt Middlebrook.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a sentiment among some that the Valley is estranged from
City Hall," Middlebrook said. "The mayor wants to demonstrate that they
don't always have to come to City Hall. City Hall will come to them."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's efforts were met with skepticism by some Valley leaders who say
the region has been long ignored by city officials.</TE>
<TE>   "The Valley has wanted the attention of City Hall for decades," said
Bonny Herman, president of the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn., which
has many members sympathetic to secession. "But the proof is in the
pudding. . . . Everybody is smart enough to look beyond the celebrity
status of the mayor or any elected official. They all need to see what's
going to happen next."</TE>
<TE>   At the Valley Economic Development Center, Hahn announced that members
of his business team will maintain office hours at the Van Nuys nonprofit
from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Wednesdays to answer questions from businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Hahnr also said he will ask the City Council to give the center an
additional $174,000 in city money to provide technical assistance to
local printing and metal companies.</TE>
<TE>   An hour later, the mayor drove up to a senior center in Reseda in a
shiny new white information van run by the city's Department of Aging.
About 70 seniors sitting outside on folding chairs in the dappled
sunshine applauded as Hahn got out and waved.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor told them that two new vans, purchased with state money,
will drive around the city and distribute information about city services
available to seniors.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Dennis Zine, who has remained neutral on the question
of secession, accompanied Hahn to the events and said the efforts will
make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   "He's coming out here without any arm-twisting," Zine said. "I think
it has impact. Nothing happens overnight. But the fact is the mayor is
accessible . . . showing there is a concern here."</TE>

<HD>D.A. Still Reviewing Ryder Case</HD>
<DH>Crime: Actress accused of shoplifting faces hearing reset to Feb.
8.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With prosecutors still undecided whether to file criminal charges
against Winona Ryder in an alleged shoplifting case, the actress appeared
Thursday in Beverly Hills Superior Court and received a judge's
permission to remain free on bail.</LD>
<LD>   Ryder was arrested last month on suspicion of stealing $4,700 worth of
merchandise from the Saks Fifth Avenue store in Beverly Hills and of
possessing pain medication without a prescription.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Elden S. Fox extended the bond that Ryder posted
and ordered her to return to court Feb. 8. She will remain free on
$20,000 bail until that date.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office is still reviewing
the case and plans to determine whether to formally charge Ryder by that
date, spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is still some information being presented to us by police and
other sources," Gibbons said outside court. "We want to review all the
possible evidence before we decide on this case."</TE>
<TE>   Ryder, dressed in a black sweater and black skirt, stood in court for
less than a minute next to her attorney, Mark Geragos. The pair left
through a back door, avoiding the reporters waiting outside the
courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos said later that he has discussed the case with prosecutors and
plans to show them what he believes is exonerating evidence. He declined
to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   "Once they examine the evidence I have, I'm hoping that these charges,
at least a portion of them, will not be filed," he said later Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder, 30, was allegedly seen Dec. 13 by store security personnel and
on video monitors grabbing women's clothing and hair accessories,
removing anti-theft devices from the items and stuffing them into a large
bag.</TE>
<TE>   When security personnel confronted her outside, they found the
merchandise and the pain medication. Police have said that Ryder did not
appear to be under the influence of the prescription painkillers when she
was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   She was booked on suspicion of felony grand theft and felony
possession of pharmaceuticals without a prescription.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos has said that Ryder had receipts for the clothing and a valid
prescription for the medication and that the arrest resulted from a
misunderstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder is a two-time Academy Award nominee, for best actress in "Little
Women" and for best supporting actress in "The Age of Innocence."</TE>
<TE>   She had been set to appear in court today, but the hearing was changed
to Thursday because Geragos had a scheduling conflict.</TE>

<HD>Vendor, Teen Fatally Shot on Streets</HD>
<DH>Crime: Single mother of four dies in the first of three attacks in
about an hour. A third victim is stabbed by a carjacker.</DH>

<LD>A popular fruit vendor was shot and killed in an Elysian Park
neighborhood in the first of a series of unrelated attacks in northeast
Los Angeles on Wednesday evening.</LD>
<LD>   Concepcion Gutierrez, 47, of East Los Angeles was shot about 6:45 p.m.
as she sold produce from her truck on Blake Avenue. The killer abandoned
the truck on a nearby street and took an unknown amount of money.</LD>
<LD>   About an hour later, in a strip mall on Sunset Boulevard near Bates
Avenue, a 14-year-old boy was gunned down in an apparent gang-related
attack, police said. Minutes later, a man was stabbed on Solano Avenue,
also in the Elysian Park area, in another carjacking. He was hospitalized
in stable condition, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Detectives said they were having trouble finding witnesses to any of
the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In Gutierrez's killing, "we're still not sure about the motive--was it
a robbery or carjacking?" said Det. Bob Lopez said. "A lot of people
probably watched this, but obviously, they're not saying anything."</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez was the mother of four, police said. She had driven through
the neighborhood selling produce and candy for about seven years,
neighbors said.</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez was from Cuernavaca, Mexico, and was a single mother,
neighbor Josefina Rodriguez, 52, said.</TE>
<TE>   "She tried to face life by herself, and in looking for a better life,
she found death," Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   Police also were having trouble finding witnesses to the boy's
shooting, despite the heavy foot and car traffic on Sunset Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents and business employees said he had just left a
restaurant when he was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information on any of the attacks is asked to call
detectives at (213) 847-4261 or (877) LAW-FULL.</TE>

<HD>Henna Artists Protest Ban</HD>
<DH>Santa Monica: Council is asked to reconsider prohibition, imposed
over concerns about the safety of dyes and its view that the art form is
not entertainment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roy Mayhew knowingly broke the law Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Squeezing a small plastic bottle filled with a thick brown paste
called henna, he drew swirls and lines on the arms and backs of several
young women at Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade.</LD>
<LD>   The application of these designs was banned from the Promenade and the
Santa Monica Pier by the City Council on a 4-3 vote in November after
several people who may have received fake henna complained of health
problems. But Mayhew and other henna artists say the ordinance is unfair
and are calling for the council to reconsider the ban.</LD>
<TE>   "We have a right to do art," said Mayhew, who's been making a living
by drawing henna designs on Promenade visitors for five years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very surprising that Santa Monica, [which is] known for its
artistic innovation, would choose to ban [henna]," said Jerry Rubin, a
Santa Monica activist.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin joined Mayhew and two other henna artists Thursday on the
Promenade to defy the ban, offering free drawings to passersby.</TE>
<TE>   The art form, which is called Mehndi, has existed for 5,000 years in
places such as India, North Africa and the Middle East. Traditionally,
people decorate their hands and feet with elaborate henna-dye designs for
wedding ceremonies, religious holidays and other celebrations.</TE>
<TE>   To make the dye, leaves of the henna plant are ground into a powder
and then mixed with lemon juice to make a paste. The designs are
temporary, lasting anywhere from one to four weeks, depending on how
frequently the area is washed.</TE>
<TE>   One henna design that did not disappear, however, led a woman to sue
the city. According to city attorney records, the case was dismissed in
September 2000--just five months after it was filed--but it raised
concerns about the safety of the dyes.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been complaints--a lot of complaints--that they don't use
the right dye," said Councilman Herb Katz, who voted for the ordinance.
He conceded, however, that most henna artists do use proper dyes.</TE>
<TE>   Real henna occurs in brown or shades of orange. Mayhew said black
henna, which can cause stains, rashes or puffiness of the skin, is
probably hair dye.</TE>
<TE>   But Katz said health problems were not the only reason the council
banned henna. "We don't consider them entertainment," he said of the
artists. "It's like a tattoo parlor. . . . The Promenade is for
entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   In the past, henna artists were only required to obtain a performer's
permit from the city to set up a booth on the Promenade. On Jan. 1, when
the ordinance became law, no new permits were issued to henna artists and
the existing ones became invalid.</TE>
<TE>   The henna artists say they deserve a space on the Promenade just like
sketch artists, face painters and clowns who make balloons.</TE>
<TE>   "The city's getting free entertainment, free art," Luke Chanthadara
said as he filled up a tube with henna paste while standing outside
French Connection, a clothing store. "We bring millions of dollars in
revenue to the city, here to the Promenade."</TE>
<TE>   Shahrzad Shervanloo, a saleswoman at the store, agreed. "Actually,
they bring a lot of business here. The people, they're not coming only
for shopping," she said. "They're coming to have fun."</TE>
<TE>   Chanthadara said it wasn't much fun when a Santa Monica police officer
cited him Jan. 4 for applying henna tattoos on the Promenade. He said he
faces up to six months in jail for the misdemeanor, yet he refuses to
stop or go elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel it's a bad law," he said. "The fact that we're out here,
we're considered criminals."</TE>

<HD>EIR on Importing Water for Subdivision Rejected</HD>
<DH>Development: Court ruling could be a setback for Newhall Ranch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL CHAMBERS</AU>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state appellate court on Thursday threw out an environmental
impact report that proposed importing Kern County water for future
subdivisions in the Santa Clarita Valley, including the 21,000-home
Newhall Ranch project.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of Newhall Ranch said the ruling is a setback for the
project. But an attorney for the water-importing agency downplayed the
order, saying the subdivision would use little of the water.</LD>
<LD>   In its 20-page opinion, the 2nd Appellate District Court in Los
Angeles rejected the report because it was based on another environmental
report invalidated last year by a Northern California court. That report
set guidelines for divvying up state water among farms and developers.</LD>
<TE>   Thursday's ruling reversed a lower court judgment in a lawsuit brought
against the Castaic Lake Water Agency by the Friends of the Santa Clara
River, a leading opponent of Newhall Ranch. In the suit, Los Angeles
Superior Court Judge David P. Yaffe found in favor of the water agency.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for the agency said it has two options: It can wait for
the approval of the report for the water-sharing guidelines and rewrite
the Santa Clarita document accordingly. Or it can draft a new report for
water imports from Kern County.</TE>
<TE>   Under the state water-sharing agreement, the Castaic agency plans to
buy 41,000-acre feet per year from the Kern County Water Agency for
development projects in and around Santa Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 17,600-acre feet Newhall Ranch will use per year, only
1,600-acre feet will be imported water, according to a Los Angeles County
analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote on the Newhall
Ranch EIR on Jan 22. A spokesman for Supervisor Michael Antonovich, whose
district includes the Santa Clarita Valley, said it was unclear whether
Thursday's ruling would delay the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists contend the water agency cannot meet the demands of
Newhall Ranch without tapping the Santa Clara River and underground
sources in the Santa Clarita Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "This ruling [is] going to upset every action that affects water and
it will force a new environmental review," said Ron Bottorff, president
of Friends of the Santa Clara River.</TE>
<TE>   But Bob Clark, the attorney for the Castaic agency, said: "Newhall
Ranch is not significantly dependent on the Castaic Lake Water Agency for
its water supply because it has developed significant other water
resources."</TE>

<HD>Mamma Mia! Sounds Like Lucy Had a Hand in Assembling the Pizza Pies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HARVEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oh, my, pizza pie!--as one long-ago commercial used to cry.</LD>
<LD>   One of the workers at Dan Arney's packaging company has a part-time
job at a pizza parlor. The fellow told Arney he was in the kitchen when
he looked outside and noticed his car door was open and some of his
belongings were missing.</LD>
<LD>   He told two other pizza employees and they all went out to inspect.
Problem is, one of them left the keys inside the parlor and the door
locked.</LD>
<TE>   "They had to call the manager on a cell phone to get his keys to open
the door," Arney said. "While they are waiting, they look inside as the
pizzas come off the oven conveyor and land on the floor--flop, flop,
flop--about eight or 10 of them."</TE>
<TE>   Takeouts--to the trash can.</TE>
<TE>   Did Fritz know about this? My apologies to all you Angelenos who woke
up Thursday and found you had to shovel off your front porches and
driveways. I would have warned you about the blizzard, but I forgot to
check the forecast on the Weather Channel Web page, which was later
relayed to me by Toufan Rahimpour (see accompanying). Vic Trippetti and
Michael Clark came upon similar forecasts. Amazing how the weather warmed
up later in the day.</TE>
<TE>   Major insult? I just don't understand how it can happen. L.A.'s mayors
have all been so charismatic, and yet people keep bungling their names.</TE>
<TE>   I've recounted the many variations of Richard Riordan that appeared in
print, including "Robert Riordan" in Time magazine.</TE>
<TE>   And the syndrome has carried over to his successor. One network news
show identified Jim Hahn as "Mike Haan" a while back.</TE>
<TE>   Now Gary Kemsley of Sun Valley has come across another foul-up, though
it pertains to Hahn's title (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Even Hahn's own city couldn't get his title straight.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe it wasn't an error. Perhaps, as Kemsley points out, Hahn has
quietly declared martial law, feeling he has to do something to keep the
San Fernando Valley from seceding.</TE>
<TE>   Bon voyage, Mr. Major, eh, Mayor! Of course, even when writers get
their names straight, L.A.'s mayors don't appear in the best light. The
New York Times once said of Riordan: "He is no speech maker and is
terrible on television. Even some of his allies refer to him with a mix
of affection and exasperation as 'Mayor Magoo.' "</TE>
<TE>   Which in California, of course, qualifies him as a major gubernatorial
hopeful.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times recently referred to Hahn as "phlegmatic." As in
"sluggish"? I dunno about that. As Times columnist Patt Morrison noted
the other day, Hahn has taken five weeks of vacation in his first six
months on the job. Sounds to me like he's got plenty of get up and go.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, his absences also might explain why his own city's
Department of Public Works is unsure of his title.</TE>
<TE>miscelLAny:</TE>
<TE>   The Highlights, Beverly Hills High's newspaper, carries an ad with a
message from a local driving school to the students.</TE>
<TE>   "To better serve you," the driving school says, it has "acquired the
latest in car models with cell phones."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing like chatting with a pal while taking a driving lesson.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The two candidates for the 2nd District seat on the Los Angeles
City Council together have spent about $1 million to compete for the
$133,000-a-year job, campaign finance reports filed Thursday show.</LD>
<LD>   The reports show Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Panorama City) and
entertainment executive Wendy Greuel had just $66,000 in cash between
them as of Dec. 31, two months before the runoff for the east San
Fernando Valley seat.</LD>
<LD>   Cardenas' contributors include fellow Assemblymen John Dutra
(D-Fremont) and Joe Canciamilla (D-Pittsburg). Both gave $500, the
maximum allowed. State legislators and their aides were generous donors
to Cardenas' campaign.</LD>
<TE>   Greuel's runoff effort received $500 each from the Motion Picture
Assn. of America, Sony Pictures and Warner Bros., reports filed with the
City Ethics Commission show.</TE>

<HD>UCLA Will Build TV, Film Archive in Santa Clarita</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the help of a wealthy film buff, UCLA is planning to
consolidate the country's second-largest media collection at a campus to
be built in Valencia, university officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed 60-acre site for the UCLA Film and Television Archive was
purchased by the Packard Humanities Institute, a nonprofit foundation in
Los Altos headed by computer heir David Packard. Escrow on the land,
bought from the Newhall Land and Farming Corp., closed last month.</LD>
<LD>   The nonprofit plans to build a new UCLA Film and Television
Preservation Center on the site in the next few years to house the
archive's 27 million feet of newsreel footage and 220,000 films and TV
programs.</LD>
<TE>   The collection is now spread among four sites on UCLA's Westwood
campus and at the old Technicolor building in Hollywood, on Cahuenga
Boulevard, archive officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The new facility would bring the collection together, and give its 63
employees a single, state-of-the-art place to work on film restoration
and preservation, archive director Tim Kittleson said. It will also host
a new master's degree program in "moving image archiving studies," which
university officials said would be the first of its kind in North
America.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a lot of wiggle room when it comes to space," Kittleson
said. "But when you try and maintain and conserve this collection, to
have it this [spread out] makes it very tough."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed campus will be at McBean Parkway and Rockwell Canyon
Road, between the California Institute of the Arts and the two-year
College of the Canyons. A delighted Santa Clarita Mayor Frank Ferry on
Thursday referred to the site as "university row."</TE>
<TE>   Ferry praised UCLA's choice of Santa Clarita for the 17-year-old
archive, whose collection is exceeded in size only by that of the Library
of Congress in Washington. The area is home to a number of
post-production companies and nearly 20 sound stages, and its rugged
terrain has long been a favorite locale for the old horse operas the
archive keeps.</TE>
<TE>   Packard, son of Hewlett-Packard computer pioneer Bill Packard, is a
former classics professor at UCLA who fell in love with old movies about
20 years ago, and has likened the early Hollywood output to the Greek
classics. He operates a vintage movie house in Palo Alto, and purchased
at least 2,500 silent films from Hollywood's Silent Movie Theater in the
1980s and 1990s for donation to the archive.</TE>

<HD>Cooley, Other Officials Back State Takeover of South Gate Elections</HD>
<DH>Politics: With dueling recall battles and a city clerk stripped of
power, some see a need for outside intervention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carmen Avalos, the South Gate city clerk, shouldn't want for work
these days.</LD>
<LD>   Every elected official in her city is facing a voter recall drive, and
it's her job to oversee the process.</LD>
<LD>   But after the City Council stripped Avalos of most of her duties, the
small-city clerk has attracted some big-time friends.</LD>
<TE>   In the past week, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley, state
Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier) and Assemblyman Marco Firebaugh (D-Los
Angeles) have backed Avalos' effort to have the state take over the
city's elections.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, many residents of South Gate have lost faith in the
election process," said Firebaugh, who lives in the city.</TE>
<TE>   California Secretary of State Bill Jones on Thursday stopped short of
saying that he would run the city's elections, but he said investigators
would be sent to oversee the electoral process.</TE>
<TE>   "The type of fear, intimidation and questionable campaign tactics that
have plagued the elections' climate and the orderly conduct of government
in the city of South Gate cannot continue," Jones said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The unusual request for outside monitoring comes after the
administration stripped Avalos of her electoral duties and hired an
interim clerk, claiming Avalos is unqualified and biased because she also
is a target of a voter recall.</TE>
<TE>   "I think anybody would do a better job than Ms. Avalos," Treasurer
Albert Robles said.</TE>
<TE>   But Avalos said officials really aim to control the elections by
installing their own person with the power to throw out the recalls on
technicalities.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, residents were outraged when then-City Clerk Nina Banuelos
invalidated recall attempts against Robles and Vice Mayor Xochilt
Ruvalcaba, even though the city attorney said the recall petitions
appeared valid.</TE>
<TE>   The election controversy is just the latest clash between Avalos and
the council majority over control of the clerk's office. Days after
Avalos defeated a majority-backed candidate in last year's election, her
salary was slashed. Avalos said she has never been allowed to perform the
normal duties of a city clerk, such as preparing agendas.</TE>
<TE>   And on Thursday, police were called to Avalos office to keep order
while city workers tried to confiscate her computer. The council majority
accuses her of using the computer for political purposes, a charge she
denies.</TE>
<TE>   Avalos' status as the city's top election official seemed in question
the moment recall notices were served in October against Mayor Raul
Moriel, Ruvalcaba and Councilwoman Maria Benavides.</TE>
<TE>   At the council meeting Oct. 23, City Atty. Salvador Alva took copies
of the recall petitions meant for Avalos and without explanation left
City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Alva later said he took those actions as a "cautious" measure to
protect the city's interests, but recall supporters suspected electoral
subterfuge.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the council hired a new election official, Julia Sylva,
former city attorney in Hawaiian Gardens. She has the right to invalidate
a recall drive for reasons ranging from signature fraud to not filing
paperwork by the deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Though they are satisfied with Sylva's qualifications, city officials
say they would also welcome greater state scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not adverse to the idea," Alva said.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers against Robles and the council majority, who allege
corruption, say they are approaching their goal. They need to gather the
signatures of 20% of registered voters to qualify for the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, supporters of the council majority recently launched recall
drives against Avalos and Councilmen Hector De La Torre and Henry
Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley, Firebaugh and Escutia said they became involved because of
South Gate's volatile and sometimes violent history of election-related
incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Investigations by Cooley's public integrity unit led to the conviction
last year of a former council candidate on electoral fraud charges.
Prosecutors filed similar charges against another former candidate last
month.</TE>
<TE>   They have also filed charges against a printer for allegedly producing
hit-piece mailers during the city's most recent election.</TE>

<HD>Ethics Panel Fines Padilla $79,000</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Ethics Commission on Thursday levied its
largest penalty ever against an elected official, fining City Council
President Alex Padilla for campaign violations, as members said they hope
to find ways to make future violators pay fines out of their own pockets
rather than with contributors' money.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the panel's staff director expressed skepticism
about Padilla's explanation for why the councilman exceeded city spending
limits in his 1999 campaign.</LD>
<LD>   Padilla blamed late, unexpected bills that arrived after election day.
But LeeAnn Pelham, the panel's executive director, said some of the bills
came in before the runoff election that year.</LD>
<TE>   The commission ordered Padilla to pay more than $79,000 for those
violations and for accepting two contributions in excess of the city's
$500 limit on council candidates.</TE>
<TE>   He will not have to personally pay for the violations, which the
commission president called "dramatic and serious." City law allows
politicians such as Padilla to raise money for a legal defense fund to
cover the cost of penalties, a path the councilman's aides said he would
take.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners said that although Padilla was entitled to use a legal
defense fund, they may want to reconsider that practice in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "Once a violation is established, it seems to me there ought to be
some sort of more serious consequence rather than going out and raising
additional money to pay the fine," said Commissioner Dale Bonner.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Padilla's campaign agreed to abide by the city spending cap
of $275,000 in order to receive city matching funds. A commission audit,
however, concluded that he broke that cap by $54,738.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla agreed to repay the $76,821.33 he received in matching funds
and pay a $2,500 fine for accepting the two campaign contributions in
excess of the $500 limit.</TE>
<TE>   The fines are the third the commission has levied involving Padilla's
1999 election. The first was against the political arm of the Los Angeles
County Federation of Labor, which the commission charged $2,000 for
failing to properly disclose $31,000 it spent on an independent campaign
supporting Padilla's election. In 2000, the commission fined MediaOne for
excessive campaign contributions to candidates, including Padilla.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla, who was elected council president in June, had no comment
Thursday.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District has won the latest round in
a battle over an eight-acre canyon property it owns in Brentwood.</LD>
<LD>   A Superior Court judge in Los Angeles ruled this week that the
district does not have to sell the property to a parks consortium that
last year bid $2 million for it. The decision allows the financially
troubled district to offer the Sullivan Canyon land to other possible
buyers for what its officials say could be as much as $17 million.</LD>
<LD>   The money from the sale could go toward constructing badly needed
schools elsewhere, said Patrick Perry, an attorney for the district.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A man convicted this week of making a false bomb threat at Los
Angeles International Airport will be sentenced Jan. 31, a judge
announced Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   A Los Angeles Superior Court jury on Tuesday found Jose Morales, 29,
guilty of making a false report of a bomb to an agency or business. He
faces up to four years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly after boarding a United Airlines flight to El Salvador on
Sept. 19, Morales, who was being deported, told a flight attendant that
he had a bomb inside the bag and locked himself in the restroom, said
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth Kahn.</LD>
<TE>   During trial, Morales denied saying he was trying to avoid
deportation. Morales said he was merely singing the Spanish song "La
Bomba," by the group Azul Azul.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Official Admits to Having Sold His Vote</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge gives him a suspended sentence, probation and fines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Huntington Beach Councilman Dave Garofalo pleaded guilty
Thursday to one felony and 15 misdemeanors for repeatedly voting on
matters involving companies that bought advertising from his local
publishing business.</LD>
<LD>   The plea ends a 17-month investigation by local and state prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   Garofalo, who resigned from office last month, was given a suspended
sentence by Superior Court Judge Ronald P. Kreber and placed on three
years' unsupervised probation. He must pay fines totaling $49,700 and
complete 200 hours of community service by April 1, 2003. He also cannot
run again for public office unless he can persuade a judge to clear his
record after three years.</LD>
<TE>   Of his fines, $47,000 will be paid to the state Fair Political
Practices Commission for 24 counts of violating financial reporting laws.
The commission is scheduled to formally approve the civil fines at a
meeting Tuesday in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The embattled former councilman spoke outside the courtroom Thursday
about what he called his "massive, total self-destruction."</TE>
<TE>   He insisted that he didn't realize that it was illegal to vote after
soliciting tens of thousands of dollars in advertising from businesses
seeking city decisions. He said the punishment was harsh but admitted
that he broke the law.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to take my medicine," said Garofalo, 56.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors said Garofalo's behavior was not a case of a local
official inadvertently stumbling over state law. His votes spanned two
years and were "flagrant, repeated and consistent," Dist. Atty. Tony
Rackauckas said.</TE>
<TE>   "The disposition on this is a very good one," he said. "It puts into
perspective what was going on with Mr. Garofalo."</TE>
<TE>   The felony violation stems from Garofalo's vote in 1999--with a
unanimous council--for the city to fund the Huntington Beach Conference
and Visitors Bureau, for which Garofalo had published an annual visitors
guide since 1993. Under the contract, the city funded the nonprofit
bureau with $200,000 for 1999-00 and an additional $270,000 for 2000-01.
The agreement allowed Garofalo to keep the advertising revenue from the
guide.</TE>
<TE>   Garofalo also published a newspaper called the Local News, the
directory for the city's chamber of commerce and two political mailers
called Huntington Beach Today, distributed in 1994 and 1998--the same
years Garofalo ran for council.</TE>
<TE>   The misdemeanor violations involved 15 companies seeking city
approvals that paid Garofalo $500 to $13,000 annually for advertising
from January 1998 to August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The fair practices commission fine stemmed from Garofalo's failure to
report that and other income on annual statements of economic interest.</TE>

<HD>Remains of Mastodon Unearthed in Simi Valley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Workers digging home sites in Simi Valley uncovered the skeletal
remains of a prehistoric mastodon that scientists are calling a major
discovery in California paleontology.</LD>
<LD>   The skull, tusks, jaws, teeth and femur of the long-extinct mammal
were found two weeks ago at the bottom of a 30-foot pit dug by workers
building the 800-home Big Sky Ranch project in eastern Ventura County,
north of the Ronald Reagan Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The mastodon, which is related to the modern-day elephant, will be
shipped today to the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History for
further study and possible exhibit.</LD>
<TE>   "Maybe we have a whole Jurassic Park out here," Mike Mayfield,
superintendent of the construction site, said as he looked at a giant
tusk on a flatbed truck. "We have hit Indian skeletons. We hit a walrus
skeleton in Newbury Park, but this is the first mastodon uncovered by the
company."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists say that unlike their cousins, the wooly mammoth, only a
handful of the smaller mastodons have been unearthed in California, with
many more found in the Midwest and on the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   The Simi Valley mastodon is estimated to weigh more than 1 ton and be
up to 30,000 years old. Its tusks alone weigh several hundred pounds
each, and its dozen, 2-inch-long teeth are conical, unlike the flatter
grazing teeth of modern elephants.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite a big deal. Only a few mastodons have ever been found in
this area," said Cara Corsetti, project manager for paleontology at SWCA
Environmental Consultants in Mission Viejo, which sent scientists to the
Simi Valley site to excavate the mastodon. "We find a lot of marine
mammals in this area--whales, sea lions, seals, walruses, early
representatives of the sea cow group, but no mastodons."</TE>
<TE>   A huge mastodon was found in 1997 near Hemet during construction of a
dam in Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   While mastodon skeletons are rare, pygmy mammoth remains have been
found on the Channel Islands. Scientists said there once was either a
land bridge to the islands or the animals simply swam. Mastodons appeared
3.75 million years ago and became extinct about 11,000 years ago.
Scientists believe they were powerfully built, covered in reddish hair
and were up to 10 feet tall and 15 feet long--shorter but longer than
today's elephants.</TE>
<TE>   The Simi Valley discovery was made when a construction team was
digging a pit in one of the green hillsides off Erringer Road.</TE>
<TE>   Julia Frazier, a paleo-monitor hired to look out for bones and
fossils, was scrambling between 15 large ground scrapers as they took off
layers of dirt. Then she saw something sticking from the ground. The
construction stopped while she poked around in the silt.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw what I think was part of the scapula [shoulder]," the
23-year-old Downey woman said. "It was literally just an inch out of the
ground. I started picking away at it with an ice pick and a whole row of
teeth began to emerge. I saw these molars that were 5 inches across. I
said, 'Please don't be a cow.' "</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, tusks and leg bones emerged. After more than a week, the
skeletal remains were out of the ground. They were all packed together in
burlap and plaster, which can be cut off like a cast.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty excited because I was used to just finding shells and
small rib bones, but to find a jaw fully intact and to be from a mastodon
was amazing," Frazier said.</TE>
<TE>   Mayfield had the remains lifted onto a truck, where it awaited the
trip to the natural history museum.</TE>

<HD>Judge Charged With Molesting Boy, 12</HD>
<DH>Crime: Ronald S. Kline, under indictment on child porn charges, is
accused of molesting the youth from 1976 to '78.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County judge under house arrest for allegedly possessing
child pornography was arrested again Thursday and charged with molesting
a 12-year-old boy about a quarter century ago.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Ronald C. Kline, 61, is accused of befriending the youngster,
who lived in his Irvine neighborhood, and sexually abusing him at least
four times from 1976 to 1978. Kline was a prominent civil attorney at the
time.</LD>
<LD>   Without knowing about their son's alleged contact with Kline, the
boy's parents filed a stalking complaint against Kline in 1980 after
noticing him driving slowly past their house, police said. No charges
were filed as a result of the complaint.</LD>
<TE>   Police said the accuser, now 37, told investigators about the sexual
abuse earlier this month after learning from news reports that the judge
faces federal charges of storing more than 100 illegal pornographic
images on his home computer.</TE>
<TE>   Kline's attorney, Paul S. Meyer, said his client intends to plead not
guilty to the molestation charges at a Feb. 6 arraignment.</TE>
<TE>   "The allegation is untrue," Meyer said. "The historical charges . . .
are from 26 years ago and involve one complaining person."</TE>
<TE>   The latest charges set up a highly unusual judicial election in March.
The judge remains a candidate for reelection even though he is confined
to his home. Kline is running unopposed on the ballot, though eight
people have announced they will be write-in challengers. Write-in
candidates rarely win elections.</TE>
<TE>   If Kline wins the election, he would remain on paid leave--drawing his
$136,244 annual salary--until his criminal cases are resolved or he is
disciplined by the state Council on Judicial Performance.</TE>
<TE>   Kline surrendered to Irvine police at 7 a.m. Thursday. He posted
$100,000 bail and returned to his Irvine home, where he has been under
house arrest since a federal grand jury indicted him on pornography
possession charges in November.</TE>
<TE>   The latest allegations are the most serious against Kline, who has
pleaded not guilty to the pornography charges. The accusations have left
the judge's former colleagues, including the man now supervising his
prosecution, in shock.</TE>
<TE>   "This is someone who I felt I knew and had a friendship with, so it's
sad," said Tony Rackauckas, who worked alongside Kline as a judge before
becoming district attorney three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they interviewed the alleged molestation victim
earlier this month and have independently corroborated that Kline knew
the boy, whose name is being withheld even though he is now an adult.</TE>
<TE>   The accuser's parents told police more than two decades ago that Kline
was stalking their son, according to court records filed by prosecutors.
Nothing then could be done about the complaint because there was no
specific law against stalking at the time, said Irvine Police Lt. Sam
Allevato.</TE>
<TE>   The stalking report was destroyed years ago during a routine purging
of old records, Allevato said.</TE>
<TE>   Court records indicate that Kline went on vacation with the accuser in
December 1982, after he had turned 18. A diary written on the judge's
home computer made references to the judge's attraction to young boys,
including a 2000 entry naming the accuser, the records said. Other
entries dated last year referred to attempts by Kline to find the accuser
and to include him as an heir in the judge's will, according to the court
records.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the accuser remained silent about the abuse until 1995,
when he told his parents and fiance. He insisted then, however, that he
did not want to report the matter to police, court records show. But
authorities said he changed his mind after learning of Kline's recent
federal indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Kline now faces four felony counts accusing him of committing lewd
acts on a child under 14--charges that carry a maximum of 14 years in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   State law allows prosecution of child molestation cases even when
victims come forward years after the crimes were committed. Under the
law, prosecutors must file charges within one year of a complaint being
made.</TE>
<TE>   If Kline wins reelection, his future as a judge will rest on the
outcome of his court cases. If he pleads guilty or is convicted of a
felony, the Commission on Judicial Performance will suspend him without
pay.</TE>
<TE>   If an appeals court overturns the conviction, Kline will be reinstated
and paid back pay for the time he spent on suspension. If, however,
Kline's appeals are rejected, the commission will remove him permanently
from the bench.</TE>
<TE>   The last time the commission removed a judge because of a criminal
conviction was in 1990, when Beverly Hills Municipal Court Judge Charles
Boags was fired, said commission Director Victoria Henley. Boags was
convicted of obstruction of justice in 1988 for improperly suspending
fines on parking tickets issued to his son and his son's friends.</TE>

<HD>Former Nuclear Worker Charged With Threats</HD>
<DH>Court: Man fired from the San Onofre plant also faces weapons and
drug counts. His arraignment is postponed.</DH>

<LD>Teary-eyed and wearing a yellow jail jumpsuit, former San Onofre
nuclear plant worker David L. Reza stood mute in an Orange County
courtroom Thursday as he was charged with threatening to kill two former
co-workers.</LD>
<LD>   Reza, 44, an avid gun collector who had a rocky history with his San
Onofre bosses, faces 13 counts, including making criminal threats,
possession of illegal assault weapons and drug violations. More charges
could be filed as investigators sort through about 270 weapons they
reportedly found in Reza's Laguna Niguel home and a San Juan Capistrano
storage garage.</LD>
<LD>   Reza was arrested late Tuesday following an investigation that began
after he told a former co-worker Jan. 4 that he was "going to take my
guns, go to San Onofre and whack a bunch of people."</LD>
<TE>   His long hair pulled back in a ponytail, Reza cried softly through
much of his court appearance. He spoke only when Superior Court Judge
Carlton P. Biggs asked if he was David Reza. "Ree-za, sir," he corrected.</TE>
<TE>   Arraignment was postponed until Jan. 18. Reza was returned to jail
without bond.</TE>
<TE>   He faces up to six years in state prison if convicted of the charges,
which include both felony and misdemeanor counts. He is accused of
possessing a Bushmaster XM-15 assault rifle and an M1 carbine with an
illegal pistol hand grip. He also is charged with illegal possession of
tear gas, tracer ammunition, hand grenades, metal knuckles and a
switchblade; and with illegally carrying a handgun in his car.</TE>
<TE>Protective Order Issued</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they found the handgun when Reza arrived home
Tuesday evening. Drug charges were based on cocaine and drug
paraphernalia they allegedly found in the house.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Elizabeth
Henderson said that Reza was charged with making specific threats against
two former colleagues and that Biggs issued a protective order barring
Reza from contacting plant employees or officials from his union. The
Utility Workers Union of America Local 246 is representing Reza in
connection with his December dismissal for absenteeism.</TE>
<TE>   "They're scared for their lives," Henderson said of the two people
Reza allegedly targeted in his threat.</TE>
<TE>   Reza's girlfriend and roommate, Kristi Mattauch, Thursday repeated
earlier denials that Reza had threatened anyone or that he owned illegal
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's a misunderstanding," she said, surrounded by a dozen
friends and relatives. "This is a big corporation picking on a small
union worker. They've really blown this all out of proportion."</TE>
<TE>   Reza grew up in the Toledo, Ohio, area but has lived in Southern
California since at least the early 1980s, when he was a Marine stationed
at Camp Pendleton, according to his ex-wife.</TE>
<TE>   Cynthia J. Hoffman, now of Tacoma, Wash., said that she was married to
Reza about two years and that they had a daughter together, who is now
19.</TE>
<TE>   She described the marriage as uneven and said she left California to
get away from Reza.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman has sued him for unpaid child support and twice had his wages
garnisheed. He was supposed to pay $300 a month in support.</TE>
<TE>   The last time she had contact with him, she said, was last summer,
when he sent a birthday present to their daughter.</TE>

<LD>A tile setter pleaded not guilty Thursday to a charge of murder for
allegedly chopping up his live-in girlfriend and dumping her remains into
the ocean near Point Mugu.</LD>
<LD>   Alfonso Castillo, 37, nodded his head but said nothing as his
attorney, Deputy Public Defender Doug Daily, spoke to him.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Vincent O'Neil set a preliminary hearing in the
case for Feb. 26.</LD>
<TE>   The Panorama City resident is accused of killing Maria Guadalupe
Pinaloza Ambrio, 34. He is being held at Ventura County Jail in lieu of
$1-million bail.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo was arrested early Dec. 6 on Pacific Coast Highway near Mugu
Rock. A sheriff's deputy noticed Castillo's vehicle parked illegally near
an ocean cliff.</TE>
<TE>   A deputy who confronted Castillo as he climbed the rocky slope said
the suspect was covered with blood. Castillo tried to escape when
deputies saw blood in his vehicle, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   As Castillo sat handcuffed on some rocks, deputies shone flashlights
on the surf and saw body parts bobbing in the waves.</TE>

<HD>Clippers Dropped by Nets</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: New Jersey shows off its versatility in 108-89
victory. L.A. is 0-3 midway through trip.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>With the noteworthy exceptions of Bruce Springsteen, saltwater
taffy and a Princeton degree, the New Jersey Nets might be about the best
thing the Garden State has to offer.</LD>
<LD>   The Nets proved during a 108-89 victory Thursday over the Clippers
before a crowd of 15,039 at Continental Airlines Arena that they can
defeat the opposition in so many different ways that it boggles the mind.</LD>
<LD>   The Nets whipped the Clippers from the inside and outside, scoring 50
points from the paint. They outrebounded the Clippers, 52-35. They also
beat the Clippers up and down the court for easy baskets.</LD>
<TE>   As ever, point guard Jason Kidd orchestrated the whole thing for the
Atlantic Division-leading Nets. He had seven points, 11 assists, nine
rebounds and zero turnovers in 28 minutes, proving once again that the
Nets got the better of an off-season trade that sent Stephon Marbury to
the Phoenix Suns.</TE>
<TE>   But there was a good deal more to the Nets' third consecutive victory
and fourth in the last five games.</TE>
<TE>   Where to begin?</TE>
<TE>   How about guard Kerry Kittles, who scored 16 of his 18 points in the
third quarter and made the Clippers pay for a lack of defensive intensity
by sinking six of eight shots? Center Todd MacCulloch scored 17 points,
making seven of eight shots and three of four free throws.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers maintained contact until the third quarter, then faded
under the Nets' suffocating pressure. Kittles scored 12 points in a row
for the Nets and the Clippers began a rapid descent, trailing by 72-63
midway through the third.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey led, 28-23, by the end of the first quarter and by 58-52 at
halftime. Kidd swished a three-pointer, then stole the ensuing inbounds
pass and fired a three-pointer while falling out of bounds that narrowly
missed at the halftime buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   The loss was the Clippers' third consecutive to begin a six-game trip
and 11th in 13 road games this season.</TE>
<TE>   "When we play at home, our fans are there and we don't want to
embarrass ourselves and we want to play well," center Michael Olowokandi
said, trying to explain the Clippers' road woes. "When we go on the road,
we just think it's all going to work out somehow. Our defense has been
atrocious. The game isn't just shooting the ball. It is half of the game,
but the defensive side is more important than the offensive and we pay no
attention to it."</TE>
<TE>   No one could smother Kittles, whose jump shot gave the Nets a 62-59
lead and started his remarkable run. He made a three-point basket moments
later, then another. He scored on a drive to the basket, then added a
layup to extend New Jersey's advantage to nine points.</TE>
<TE>   "Twelve points in a row? That's ridiculous," Clipper forward Elton
Brand said. "Granted, Jersey is a good team. They shouldn't have blown us
out like that. [But] they passed the ball around and played well. It was
a team effort tonight."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets' lead would swell to 21 points before the Clipper reserves
chipped away in the fourth quarter. Lamar Odom scored 14 points to lead
the Clippers, who fell to the .500 mark at 18-18. Brand added 13 points
and 11 rebounds and Olowokandi had 12 points and 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   And the hits kept coming for the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Corey Maggette, already nursing a sore left knee, hurt his right
knee and was forced from the game in the third quarter. He hopes to play
tonight against the Hornets at Charlotte, the Clippers' fourth game in
four cities in five nights.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, I think I'll be ready," said Maggette, limited to five
points in 12 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Maggette was perhaps the one player who could have silenced Kittles,
who carved up shooting guard Eric Piatkowski. Maggette gave his knee a
try, but lasted only one possession before returning to the bench.</TE>
<TE>   No one said the road would be easy, and the Clippers claim they were
prepared for this grueling trip, but Olowokandi seemed more annoyed than
anyone else that the same problems cropped up Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely should have had a wakeup call after the second loss on
this trip," he said, referring to Tuesday's lackluster defeat against the
Washington Wizards.</TE>
<TE>   "Our mental preparation has to be a lot different. I don't think we're
there as a team yet."</TE>

<HD>Determined Trojans Hustle Their Way Into Consciousness of the City
of Angels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The big man in the building is now a bishop, so what happened there
Thursday night should have figured.</LD>
<LD>   Belief flew. Faith soared. Prayers were, well, you know.</LD>
<LD>   The new owner of the Forum, in case you missed it, is the Faithful
Central Bible Church.</LD>
<TE>   The new owner of the UCLA basketball team, in case you missed it, is
USC.</TE>
<TE>   The rickety old fieldhouse could barely contain this town's new nasty
basketball team, what with all their elbows and shoves and screams.</TE>
<TE>   The final score was USC 81, UCLA 77.</TE>
<TE>   The final scene was a midcourt student mob reminiscent of a 27-0
celebration two months ago.</TE>
<TE>   The final explanation was much simpler.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted it more," said Trojan David Bluthenthal.</TE>
<TE>   Did they ever.</TE>
<TE>   While UCLA stayed close with late three-point baskets, this game was
decided about 18 feet closer.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, without a true center, outrebounded the Bruins by 13.</TE>
<TE>   With each of those 13 extra rebounds coming on the offensive boards.</TE>
<TE>   Which means only one thing, and that is not athleticism or reputation.</TE>
<TE>   It means only hustle.</TE>
<TE>   Forget UCLA's valiant late comeback, forget Matt Barnes' amazing seven
three-point baskets or Dan Gadzuric's 16 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   The only memory of this game the Bruins can carry with them when they
play host to top-ranked Kansas Saturday is that they were outhustled.</TE>
<TE>   "We were \o7 not\f7  going to lose this game," said Trojan Brandon
Granville. "We just were \o7 not\f7  ."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans played the entire two hours like that, in italics, while
the Bruins were mostly lower-case bland.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the end, when Granville was facing two free throws in the
final seconds to clinch the game. The same Granville who had missed much
of the second half with an eye injury that caused him to see everything
in triplicate.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything out of my right eye, I saw three of them," he said. "Three
rims, three basketballs."</TE>
<TE>   Funny thing about that eye, though. When Coach Henry Bibby desperately
put him back into the game to break the UCLA press in the waning minutes,
the blurriness slowly ceased.</TE>
<TE>   And by the time he went to the foul line with the Trojans leading,
79-77?</TE>
<TE>   "I could almost see the rim," he said. "So I just concentrated and let
my mind do the rest."</TE>
<TE>   So it did, helping him sink both free throws to sink the Bruins and
... launch the Trojans?</TE>
<TE>   Well, maybe not quite. This being the USC basketball program, even an
appearance in the Elite Eight isn't enough to keep the sky lit.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, the Trojans were clearly considered one of the most
phony teams in the country. After all, despite a 12-2 record and the
returning core of that Elite Eight group, they had earned not one mention
in the national rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, UCLA, with an 11-2 record and only a couple of bigger wins,
was ranked 11th.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like we're always having to prove everybody wrong," Bluthenthal
said.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, they even had to prove themselves wrong. For even the
Trojan players will tell you, this group did not believe it could ever
truly whip UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Besides losing 13 of the last 14 meetings between the two schools
before Thursday, USC had only to think of last year.</TE>
<TE>   Remember? The Trojans started the season at 12-2, then traveled to
Pauley Pavilion. It was supposed to be the first clear sign of their
strength. Instead, they spent the entire evening being bullied.</TE>
<TE>   Remember? In the opening minutes, Gadzuric knocked Desmon Farmer to
the floor. Then Earl Watson knocked Bluthenthal into the scorer's table.
The Trojans fell behind by 19 points and never recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Remember? USC did.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, we went there and got disrespected," Farmer said. "This
year, that wasn't going to happen to us."</TE>
<TE>   This year, payback took three minutes.</TE>
<TE>   On a rebound early in the game, Granville knocked Billy Knight to the
floor.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, Kostas Charissis knocked Rico Hines on his rear.</TE>
<TE>   On it went throughout the first half, with USC charging and UCLA
cowering.</TE>
<TE>   The first half ended when Granville literally drove over Knight for a
layup that gave USC a 37-29 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Check that.</TE>
<TE>   The first half actually ended seconds later when Farmer, swaggering
off the floor, banged chest-first into T.J. Cummings.</TE>
<TE>   They were hustling even when they weren't hustling, playing hard even
when they weren't playing.</TE>
<TE>   This continued throughout the second half, and pretty soon you were
thinking, this was the hardest anyone has played since Troy Polamalu
chased down Cory Paus.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans looked as good as they looked last year in beating
Kentucky in Philadelphia. The best freshman on the floor was none of the
guys from UCLA's highly touted trio, but a Carson kid named Errick
Craven.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins clearly are talented enough to return to the second week of
this spring's tournament. But the Trojans are clearly tough enough to
join them.</TE>
<TE>   And now, finally, for the first time in several years, their heads are
clear.</TE>
<TE>   Because for USC to be considered among the best teams in the nation,
it must first believe it is the best team in its own town.</TE>
<TE>   "Now," said Granville, "we believe."</TE>
<TE>   "Without a doubt," said Bluthenthal, "we believe."</TE>
<TE>   They are not alone.</TE>

<HD>Trojans in Fabulous Form</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Bluthenthal, Craven and Clancy
overcome 34 points by Barnes as USC gets the jump on UCLA with an 81-77
victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the first time he picked up a basketball, David Bluthenthal
wanted to play at UCLA. But the USC senior forward was never offered an
official visit to Westwood.</LD>
<LD>   Errick Craven thought about becoming a Bruin, but he and his twin
brother Derrick wanted to play together and UCLA didn't have enough
scholarships. They both landed at USC.</LD>
<LD>   Think UCLA Coach Steve Lavin wishes he had made room now?</LD>
<TE>   With Bluthenthal leading the Trojans early and Craven creating late,
unranked USC earned some respect Thursday night, outlasting No. 11 UCLA,
81-77, in front of 15,903 at the Forum.</TE>
<TE>   In extending their winning streak to nine games, USC's longest since
1992, the Trojans improved to 13-2 overall, 5-0 in Pacific 10 Conference
play. The Bruins saw their nine-game winning streak end and fell to 11-3,
4-1.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA had won 13 of the previous 14 games between the schools.</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Henry Bibby, who had lost nine of 10 meetings against his
alma mater, downplayed the game's significance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just another basketball game," said Bibby, who won three NCAA
titles as the Bruins' point guard from 1970-72. "This game is no more
important than Washington or Washington State. We did what we needed to
do at home and now we hope we can go on the road and get splits. From the
standpoint of taking the conference lead, it's a good win."</TE>
<TE>   Senior power forward Sam Clancy led USC with 19 points and 12
rebounds, his seventh double-double of the season, while Bluthenthal had
16 points and 18 rebounds. Both played 40 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA forward Matt Barnes scored a career-high 34 points and made a
school-record seven three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Brandon Granville's worst games as a collegian have occurred
against the Bruins. The senior point guard more than made up for them
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   After taking a blow to the right eye less than two minutes into the
game, Granville was poked in the same eye trying to take a charge and
came out with 9:09 remaining in the game with blurred vision.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't pass seeing three guys out there," he said .</TE>
<TE>   When Granville came out, USC clung to a three-point lead, 57-54. When
Granville returned, with 1:49 to play, the Trojans led by five, 71-66,
under the direction of junior Robert Hutchinson.</TE>
<TE>   Granville made five of six free throws down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big rivalry to us," said Granville, who had 18 points, three
assists and two steals without a turnover in 33 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "Ray Young and some of their guys tried to downplay it, saying that
Duke and Arizona were their rivals. We took that kind of personally.
That's why we came out and played the way we did."</TE>
<TE>   USC shot only 25% (11 of 44) in the first half but still led by eight
at intermission, 37-29, after limiting the Bruins to one field goal in
the final four minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans had 19 offensive rebounds in the first half and did not
commit a turnover.</TE>
<TE>   For the game, USC shot 37.3%, while UCLA made 46.6%. But USC
outrebounded UCLA, 46-33, with 24 offensive rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a poor job boxing out," Lavin said. "USC did a great job
attacking the glass. They had too many second, third and fourth
opportunities in the first half. They were playing volleyball off the
backboard."</TE>
<TE>   Bluthenthal had his second double-double of the season by halftime,
with 10 points and 11 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't going to back down from anybody," Bluthenthal said.
"They're UCLA and they have that, what's the word, a lot of clout ... but
no way they were going to outrebound us or out-physical us tonight. No
way."</TE>
<TE>   After being down by as many as nine points in the opening minutes of
the second half, UCLA used a glut of three-pointers to get back in it.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins tied the score at 62-62 with 4:17 remaining on a Barnes
three-pointer. He blew on his fingers as he turned to play defense.</TE>
<TE>   However, those same fingers released a lazy cross-court pass less than
a minute later when Craven stole the ball and went in for a layup.</TE>
<TE>   "Today I was a little overanxious because I heard about [the
importance of beating UCLA]," said Craven, who had 13 points, five
rebounds, two assists and two steals in 28 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just trying to do too much."</TE>
<TE>   Even with its rash of three-pointers at the end, five in the last five
minutes, UCLA was forced to foul, setting the stage for Granville at the
free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my second victory against them and I'm definitely looking to get
another," Granville said. "We're not trying to get too big-headed. It's
early on in the Pac-10 season, but it's good to be 5-0 in the Pac-10 and
alone in first place."</TE>

<HD>This Final Four Is One Too Many</HD>
<DH>Women: Kwan leads after short program, with Cohen, Hughes and
Nikodinov close behind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years ago, Sasha Cohen was a comet streaking through the figure
skating universe to a second-place finish at the U.S. championships. A
year after being grounded by a back injury, the sassy teenager from
Laguna Niguel is again reaching for the stars--and a place on the U.S.
Olympic team at the Salt Lake City Winter Games.</LD>
<LD>   Cohen's smooth, sprightly short program highlighted a superb afternoon
of skating by the top U.S. women Thursday at Staples Center. Her
rendition of "Sentimental Waltz" was an artistic and athletic success,
landing her in second place behind defending champion Michelle Kwan after
the first phase of the women's competition.</LD>
<LD>   Sarah Hughes, punished for her faulty technique on a jump takeoff, was
third. Angela Nikodinov of San Pedro, luminous enough to earn the
first-place vote of one judge and the hearts of the crowd, was fourth and
must move up one place in Saturday's long program to gain an Olympic
berth. The long program is worth two-thirds of the final score.</LD>
<TE>   Kwan won seven of nine first-place votes with a solid but somehow
emotionally distant performance to Rachmaninoff. The crowd, hushed when
she began her 2-minute 40-second routine, rose to its feet before she
finished her final spin and roared its tribute to the 21-year-old
Torrance native who grew up to become a five-time U.S. champion and
four-time world champ.</TE>
<TE>   "It's encouraging to know I was able to skate so well," said Kwan, who
has been finding her way through a maze of changes on and off the ice
this season, including a split with longtime coach Frank Carroll. "It's
nice to have that kind of performance, especially in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   But it was Cohen whose spark made a deeper emotional connection with
the fans.</TE>
<TE>   "My young protegee, the beautiful Ms. Cohen, when she skates like
this, everything is forgiven," said her coach, John Nicks.</TE>
<TE>   What's to forgive?</TE>
<TE>   "You have no idea," said Nicks, a dapper Englishman who, if pushed,
acknowledges he enjoys sparring with the willful 17-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   There was nothing for him to forgive Thursday. Skating last among the
main contenders, Cohen faced the music and the pressure with elegance and
determination.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't see the other skaters," said Cohen, whose marks ranged from
5.5 to 5.9 (out of a possible 6.0) for the required elements and from 5.7
to 5.9 for presentation. Those scores gave her one first-place vote,
three seconds, three thirds and two fourths.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just focusing on the pattern I had in my head of what I needed
to do, and if I stuck to that, everything would work out."</TE>
<TE>   It was reminiscent of the performance that put her in the lead after
the short program at the 2000 championships, her breakthrough moment.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess there's some similarities and some differences," she said.
"It was a great skate for me and I was pleased. It was one of my better
performances and I don't think I could have done much better. It's
different because it's an Olympic year and I'm trying to get a place on
the Olympic team."</TE>
<TE>   It's a dramatic difference from last year's national competition at
Boston, where she was relegated to watching because she hadn't recovered
from a stress fracture in a vertebra.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really difficult because I wanted to be out there," she said.
"I worked really hard [since then] and most of it has been rewarding."</TE>
<TE>   Kwan, who skated second in the 18-woman field, was rewarded for her
grace with 5.7s and 5.8s for the required elements and 5.8s and 5.9s for
presentation. The only fault she found with her ever-critical eye was a
small wobble on the landing of her required double axel.</TE>
<TE>   "There's things I could make a little better, a little stronger," she
said. "There's a lot of strong skaters, and I will have to skate well
Saturday."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes, second at last year's U.S. championships and third at the
world competition, was radiant in her "Ave Maria" routine and brought
tears to the eyes of her coach, Robin Wagner. However, the judges took a
harsher view. They gave her two 5.5s and five 5.6s among her technical
marks, apparently for taking off on the wrong edge for the first part of
her triple lutz-double loop combination jump.</TE>
<TE>   That sin, known as "flutzing" because the edge change turns a lutz
into a flip, is fairly common. However, expectations are higher for
Hughes after her victory over Kwan at Skate Canada earlier this season,
and she's being held to higher standards.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best short program I've done this season," she said. "The
jumps and each element were more complete....</TE>
<TE>   "Robin kept telling me, 'Sparkle. Be an angel.' Today I really felt
right there."</TE>
<TE>   Nikodinov, still recovering from the death in November of her mentor
and coach, Elena Tcherkasskaia, was the crowd's emotional favorite. And
her performance to "No One Gives Up on Love," was touching and
technically sound. Aside from the first-place vote she got from judge
Jeffrey Wolf of Seattle, she got two second-place votes and one
third-place vote. She also got five fourth-place votes, enough to put her
behind Hughes in the scramble for the three Olympic berths but not so far
back as to put the Olympics beyond her grasp.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big relief, but I just have to keep focused," she said of
getting through the potentially treacherous short program. "I've been
through a lot, but I always expected to skate well.... I'm just real
proud of the way I've handled everything."</TE>
<TE>   Tcherkasskaia's widower, Leonid, watched Nikodinov's performance
Thursday, a comforting reminder for Nikodinov of the woman she considered
a second mother. "I know she's looking down on me and is proud of me,"
she said.</TE>

<HD>Eldredge Beats the Quads to Win</HD>
<DH>Figure skating: He earns U.S. title and qualifies for Olympics,
along with Goebel and Weiss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twice disappointed at the Olympics, Todd Eldredge will get another
shot at a medal next month at the Salt Lake City Winter Games--and he
will go there as the U.S. men's champion.</LD>
<LD>  But he will go without having landed a quadruple jump in winning his
sixth national title.</LD>
<LD>  Should reigning world champion Evgeni Plushenko and his predecessor,
fellow Russian Alexei Yagudin, tremble in fear?</LD>
<TE>  "If you want to base it on this competition, I would say no," Eldredge
said after his "Lord of the Rings" long program was ranked first by all
nine judges at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, breaking the tie
that existed between him and Tim Goebel after the short program.</TE>
<TE>  "But if you want to base it on potential, yes."</TE>
<TE>  Goebel, who lost his opportunity to win a second successive title when
he fell on a quadruple toe loop, finished second and earned his first
Olympic trip. Michael Weiss earned the third berth, by default, after a
fervent but uneven performance.</TE>
<TE>  "None of us had our best skate tonight," said Goebel, who trains at
HealthSouth Training Center in El Segundo. "I know all of us can skate
better, and we have another month to train."</TE>
<TE>  Fifth after an ugly short program, Weiss fell on his first quad attempt
Thursday at Staples Center and began improvising to enhance the
difficulty of his program. Despite also putting his hand down on a triple
axel and stumbling on the landing of a triple lutz, Weiss also got a
ticket to Salt Lake City. Matt Savoie and Johnny Weir, who had been third
and fourth, respectively, dropped to fourth and fifth.</TE>
<TE>  "In terms of the Russians being scared, in men's figure skating
everybody has got to be scared," said Weiss, who finished seventh at the
1998 Nagano Olympics. "I'm sure Plushenko, [at the world championships]
in 2000, wasn't scared and went into it and had won everything, and he
finished fourth."</TE>
<TE>  Eldredge, 30, is the oldest U.S. men's winner since Roger Turner in
1932, also at 30. With six titles, he ranks behind only Turner and Dick
Button, who each won seven.</TE>
<TE>  This title, he said, is by far his most satisfying because he paid the
steepest price physically and emotionally.</TE>
<TE>  Dogged by bad luck, Eldredge was hampered by a bad back and finished
10th at the Albertville Games. He missed the 1994 Lillehammer team after
developing flu at the U.S. championships, but made the 1998 Nagano team.
However, a meltdown in his long program dropped him to fourth and off the
medal stand.</TE>
<TE>  Weary of the intense pressure of elite-level skating, Eldredge took a
sabbatical from Olympic-eligible skating for two years to refresh his
body and his mind. He returned last year to finish second to Goebel at
the U.S. championships and vaulted past Goebel to finish third at the
world competition.</TE>
<TE>  "This title is just more than I could have asked for," said Eldredge,
who got 5.9s (out of 6.0) across the board for his presentation marks
Thursday. "It feels great. It was a battle out there but I tried to hang
tough and do the best I could."</TE>
<TE>  Eldredge did intend to do a quad on his first jump, but turned it into
a triple toe loop after hitting a rut as he took off. He has landed only
two quads in competition, both last season.</TE>
<TE>  "I knew the biggest thing was making the Olympic team," he said. "I
made a mistake, and it's something I'll have to go home and correct.
Regardless of whether you land a certain jump or not, I still had the
rest of the program....</TE>
<TE>  "To all those people, whoever they may be, who said I was too old to do
it, too bad for them."</TE>
<TE>  Goebel, skating to "American in Paris," landed one quad, a salchow, in
combination with a triple toe loop, but fell on his second quad and
carried himself stiffly. He got four 5.9s and five 5.8s for technical
merit, but only 5.7s and 5.8s for presentation. Seven of his presentation
(or artistic) scores were lower than his technical scores, a recurring
problem for the 21-year-old Illinois native.</TE>
<TE>  "I think Tim's second mark is almost level with his first now," said
his coach, Frank Carroll. "We're working on that. When you fall it does
mar the performance. We're going to go home and decide not to fall on the
footwork in the short [program] or the quad in the long."</TE>
<TE>  Weiss had the longest and most anxious wait of the top contenders. He
was the first to skate in the final group of six, leaving plenty of time
to brood over his mistakes and wonder if he had fallen out of an Olympic
berth. "I certainly wouldn't prefer to be in that position," Weiss said.
"I would much rather skate last and know [his status] when I got off the
ice.</TE>
<TE>  "I knew I had to fight uphill and I wasn't in great position. When I
missed the first quad I said, 'That's enough.' I went down the other end
and did a quad-triple. That proved a lot to myself."</TE>
<TE>  Savoie acknowledged he didn't belong on the Olympic team after a
mediocre performance that included an early fall on a planned triple
axel-triple toe loop. "If this is going to be how I'd skate at the
Olympics, then that's not good enough," he said.</TE>
<TE>  Eldredge's program, replete with splendid spins and good footwork, was
more than good enough, to his delight.</TE>
<TE>  "In your mind, you can imagine anything," he said when asked if he
envisioned enjoying such success this week. "That's part of the reason I
came back. You dream certain things and hope to achieve those dreams. One
of those was achieved tonight. Hopefully, I've got one left.'</TE>

<LD>Dallas Maverick owner Mark Cuban, who was fined an NBA-record
$500,000 Tuesday for his criticism of game officials, said the league's
director of officials, Ed Rush, "might have been a great ref, but I
wouldn't hire him to manage a Dairy Queen."</LD>
<LD>   Minneapolis-based Dairy Queen responded in a news release on Thursday:</LD>
<LD>   " ... We like the publicity he's generated for us. But Mr. Cuban may
be surprised to find out how much it takes to manage a Dairy Queen.</LD>
<TE>   "We invite Mr. Cuban to manage a Dairy Queen for a day."</TE>
<TE>   In an email message to Bloomberg News, Cuban accepted Dairy Queen's
offer.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love to manage a DQ for a day," he said. "Do they give an
employee discount?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Soft-serve with a smile: Cuban said he mentioned Dairy Queen "because
I love 'em.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love to invite a DQ manager to come on my TV show and discuss
the job," Cuban said.</TE>

<TE>   Trivia time: Which quarterback holds the NFL record for playoff
touchdown passes?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Deadly option: Bernie Lincicome in the Rocky Mountain News:</TE>
<TE>   "So Mike Shanahan has decided to follow himself rather than Steve
Spurrier. A wise choice, but not without risk. Having been given a
lifetime commitment from Broncos owner Pat Bowlen, Shanahan's only out is
to be declared legally dead."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's all over: Greg Cote in the Miami Herald: "Upsets happen, sure.
But a St. Louis-Pittsburgh Super Bowl looms as hugely likely--and the
Rams' second hoist of the Vince Lombardi trophy in three seasons seems
even more likely still.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rams are a dome team [The Greatest Show on Turf] that [will] see
only domes in the playoffs, including the Super Bowl in New Orleans."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Always crowded: A-Company Inc. in Boise, Idaho, has landed a
$3-million contract for what might be the most sought-after seats at the
Salt Lake City Olympics--the porta-potties.</TE>
<TE>   The job is so big that A-Company has had to partner with four other
firms to supply the 2,600 portable toilets Olympic organizers ordered for
the Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hang-ups: Boo Weekley is making his first PGA Tour start in the Sony
Open in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   The former mini-tour star plays in sneakers because golf shoes hurt
his feet and rain pants because cotton pants cause him to break out in a
rash.</TE>
<TE>   No mention if he was allergic to sand.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1970, the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the
Minnesota Vikings, 23-7, in Super Bowl IV in New Orleans. Mike Garrett, a
former USC tailback, scored a Kansas City touchdown on a five-yard run.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Joe Montana of the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City
Chiefs, 45.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Hall of famer-elect Ozzie Smith completed a marvelous,
game-saving double play against the Dodgers in 1992 by touching second
base, leaping over a sliding Lenny Harris and throwing to first from
midair.</TE>
<TE>   "How the hell did you ever get out of my way?" Harris asked. Smith
replied: "Son, you were on the third floor, and I went up to the sixth
floor."</TE>

<LD>Advice from former NFL quarterback Erik Kramer prompted Ryan McCann

said.</LD>

<TE>   After talking to UCLA coaches, McCann did not believe he would get a

<TE>   McCann had to transfer to a school below the Division I level to be

<HD>U.S. Skier Fleischer Injured</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WENGEN, Switzerland</DL>
<LD>U.S. skier Chad Fleischer tore ligaments in his right knee during a
World Cup downhill training session Thursday, an accident likely to keep
him out of next month's Salt Lake City Olympics.</LD>
<LD>  Dr. Urs Allensbach said Fleischer tore the anterior cruciate and medial
collateral ligaments in his right knee and had sprained his right elbow.</LD>
<LD>  "From my side I would say the Olympics are not possible for him,"
Allensbach said. "I would say he can't ski anymore this season."</LD>
<TE>  Fleischer, 30, from Vail, Colo., caught a ski coming out of a small
tunnel midway down the Lauberhorn course--the longest on the World Cup
circuit at 14,616 feet--and careened into safety netting.</TE>
<TE>  Training for the weekend race was interrupted for about 20 minutes
after the accident. Fleischer was given a pain killer and taken by
helicopter to a hospital in Interlaken for an MRI.</TE>
<TE>  "Even before I examined him, Chad said he didn't think he would be
needing his race suit anymore this season," Allensbach said. "He was in
pain, he was disappointed by the accident and a little bit
psychologically shocked."</TE>
<TE>  U.S. Coach Dale Stephens said if the swelling in the knee subsided
enough, Fleischer likely fly would home Saturday to undergo surgery.</TE>
<TE>  While it is possible to ski with a brace wrapped around a knee with a
torn ACL, Allensbach said a person could not compete with a torn ACL and
MCL.</TE>
<TE>  "But that is for his doctors and an orthopedic surgeon to decide,"
Allensbach said.</TE>
<TE>  Stephens said he doubted Fleischer could ski in the Olympics, even with
a brace.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For four decades beginning in the 1940s, her name was synonymous
with boxing in Los Angeles. And finally, 15 years after her death, the
name Aileen Eaton has been recognized by the rest of the boxing world.</LD>
<LD>   Eaton, who promoted more than 10,000 fights from 1942 to 1980, was
voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame Thursday, the first
woman so honored.</LD>
<LD>   Among those joining her in the class of 2002 will be former
heavyweight champion Ingemar Johansson of Sweden, former welterweight
titleholder Pipino Cuevas of Mexico, former light heavyweight champ
Victor Galindez of Argentina, Jeff Fenech of Australia (who held titles
in three weight classes), promoter Sam Silverman and boxing manager
Irving Cohen.</LD>
<TE>   In all, 18 honorees will inducted into the hall, located in Canastota,
N.Y., on June 9.</TE>
<TE>   Eaton, who was 78 when she died, promoted mostly at the Olympic
Auditorium. Successful in an era when female participation in boxing was
extremely rare, Eaton staged more than 100 title bouts. Among those who
fought for her were Sugar Ray Robinson, George Foreman, Joe Frazier,
Floyd Patterson and Carmen Basilio.</TE>

<HD>Conyers Offers Selig Alternative</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The House Judiciary Committee's ranking Democrat said Thursday he
will back off his call for Bud Selig's resignation if the major league
baseball commissioner dropped his threat to eliminate teams this season.</LD>
<LD>   The Minnesota Twins and the Montreal Expos are the likely targets of
Selig's contraction plan.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan said Wednesday that Selig appeared
to violate major league rules in 1995 when he arranged a loan for his
Milwaukee Brewers from a company controlled by Twin owner Carl Pohlad.
The loan, Conyers said, created an "irreparable conflict of interest."</LD>
<TE>   "As an alternative, let me suggest that you immediately announce that
major league baseball will not contract any teams and not place any team
ownership in league control prior to the conclusion of the upcoming
season," Conyers wrote Selig on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charles Dolan made a new bid for the Boston Red Sox, a $700-million
offer that was $40 million higher than the winning offer the team
accepted three weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   The team acknowledged the offer from Dolan, the chairman of
Cablevision System Corp., but didn't say if it would affect the
$660-million offer it accepted in mid-December from a group led by John
Henry.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Donald Watkins was given the go-ahead to contact the Twins about
making an offer to buy the team.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta Brave chairman Bill Bartholomay, the chairman of baseball's
ownership committee, and Tom Ostertag, baseball's chief legal counsel,
met with Watkins and one of his lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins would be the first black controlling owner in major league
history.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wearing his old No. 33, left-hander David Wells looked right at home.
Wells returned to Yankee Stadium, where the New York Yankees announced
his signing to a $7-million, two-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   "The city knows, the organization knows, this is where I belong," said
Wells, who helped pitch the Yankees to the 1998 World Series
championship. "I've got the mentality for New York, and New York has it
for me."</TE>
<TE>   Wells had no trouble getting back his favorite number. Infielder
Alfonso Soriano gave it up voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>Wells Armed</TE>
<TE>  The signing of left-hander David Wells to a two-year contract gives the
Yankees six starters--Roger Clemens, Orlando Hernandez, Sterling
Hitchcock, Mike Mussina, Andy Pettitte and Wells, leaving the team with
the option of moving one to the bullpen--or to another team. A look at

Championships, Mark O'Meara, Scott Hoch and defending champion Brad Faxon
were at 68.</LD>
<TE>   Sergio Garcia, coming off his victory over Toms last week at Kapalua,
opened with a 71.</TE>
<TE>   Perry played in the winners-only Mercedes on Maui last week and
finished one stroke out of the playoff. Before that was the season-ending
Tour Championship in Houston for the top 30 on the money list. He
finished one out of the playoff there too.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any expectations," said Perry, a four-time winner on the
PGA Tour. "I'm trying to enjoy my last few years out here and I'm very
comfortable."</TE>

<TE>   Tiger Woods had trouble dealing with the wind he wanted in the New
Zealand Open.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, who said he'd welcome a healthy breeze so that the Paraparaumu
Beach course would play like a traditional links layout, had three
consecutive bogeys in a round of two-over 73 that left him closer to the
cut than the leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Woods was at one-over 143 to fall eight strokes behind second-round
leaders James McLean and Stephen Leaney, both from Australia. McLean, the
1998 NCAA champion for Minnesota, shot a 70, and Leaney had a 67.</TE>
<TE>   With the gusty southerlies affecting play, Woods, who opened with a 70
on Thursday, got off to a slow start and was in danger of missing the cut
after the bogey run on Nos. 13-15. He rebounded with a birdie on No. 18
to make the cut by two strokes.</TE>
<TE>   Woods reportedly was paid $2million to play in the event.</TE>
<TE>   Jae An, the 13-year-old South Korean who qualified for the tournament
Monday, shot a 74 to make the cut by a stroke with a 145 total.</TE>

<TE>   The U.S. Golf Assn. changed its proposal to limit golf club size to
allow larger club heads.</TE>
<TE>   The group, which sets the game's rules in the U.S., Mexico and Puerto
Rico, increased the size of club heads allowed under its proposal to 460
cubic centimeters from 385 cubic centimeters.</TE>
<TE>   USGA Senior Technical Director Dick Rugge said the group hasn't
approved any of the less than one dozen club heads larger than 460 cubic
centimeters that have been submitted.</TE>

<LD>Sisters Venus and Serena Williams and Jennifer Capriati, who will
be the top-seeded player at next week's Australian Open, are not expected
to play the Indian Wells tournament in March.</LD>
<LD>  Capriati, who has not put the event on her schedule, would be the most
likely to change her mind if she wanted to add a tournament. A change of
heart is unlikely for the Williams sisters, a source said.</LD>
<LD>   Venus and Serena were at the center of controversy during last year's
tournament, after Venus withdrew because of an injury about five minutes
before her scheduled semifinal match against Serena, angering tournament
officials and fans.</LD>
<TE>   Emotions ran high again days later when the crowd engaged in prolonged
and vociferous booing of the Williams sisters and their father Richard
during Serena's final against Kim Clijsters.</TE>
<TE>  Richard later accused some unidentified spectators of racism.</TE>
<TE>  Capriati will be ranked No. 1 in the world next week, passing the
injured Lindsay Davenport. Venus is now No. 3 and Serena is sixth.
Davenport too is questionable for Indian Wells. She is consulting with
noted orthopedic surgeon Richard Steadman in Colorado and may need knee
surgery.</TE>
<TE>  Indian Wells did get a boost on another front, announcing a new
tournament sponsorship deal with insurance giant Pacific Life of Newport
Beach. The tournament will be called the Pacific Life Open and the
company has a three-year agreement as title sponsor and an option for two
more.</TE>
<TE>  On another front, Pete Sampras' search for a new agent was a short one.
Days after leaving longtime agent Jeff Schwartz, he revisited the issue
and decided Thursday to return to AMG Sports, Schwartz's company.</TE>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Keyon Dooling went through a familiar pregame routine before the
Clippers faced the New Jersey Nets on Thursday. He shot some baskets with
his teammates, working on his jump shot.</LD>
<LD>  Later, he went into the locker room to undergo treatment on his badly
sprained left ankle. He also would get in one more workout, perhaps on a
treadmill or an exercise bicycle, in order to maintain his fitness.</LD>
<LD>   "The layoff is killing me," Dooling said of being sidelined since
sustaining the injury Nov. 14 against the Chicago Bulls. "It's not even
close to being ready to play on. I do see progress from where I started.
I hope to be on the court in three weeks."</LD>
<TE>  As a result, the Clippers signed Eldridge Recasner to a 10-day
contract. It's possible they could sign Recasner to a second 10-day deal
or pursue other options if Dooling isn't ready.</TE>
<TE>  Coach Alvin Gentry said it might be mid-March before Dooling is ready
to perform at something resembling full speed.</TE>
<TE>  Gentry has consistently adopted a cautious tone when asked about
Dooling's return.</TE>
<TE>  Dooling had to cut short his jump-shooting routine Thursday, grimacing
in pain after taking one shot too many. He changed to standing shots
thereafter.</TE>
<TE>  "I decided to stop while I was ahead," Dooling said later. "I was just
testing it to see if I could do it. It's tough because I definitely want
to be out there playing."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Phoenix Suns went from bad to much, much worse.</LD>
<LD>   On the brink of ending a four-game losing streak, the Suns couldn't
score in the final three minutes, blew a seven-point lead, and lost to
the Memphis Grizzlies, 102-96, Thursday night at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Spanish rookie Pau Gasol scored a career-high 31 points and blocked
five shots for the Grizzlies, who finished with a 19-4 run, including the
game's final 13 points.</LD>
<TE>   "It just fell apart on us," the Suns' Shawn Marion said.</TE>
<TE>   Stromile Swift had 16 points and 10 rebounds as the Grizzlies beat the
Suns for only the second time in 18 tries and only the second time at
America West Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix led, 96-89, after Stephon Marbury made one of two free throws
with 3:26 to play, but the Suns failed to score on their last nine
possessions, going 0 for 9 from the field with a turnover.</TE>
<TE>   Gasol and fellow rookie Shane Battier each scored six in the final
13-0 run.</TE>
<TE>   Gasol was 12-for-20 from the field.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 111, New York 89--Dirk Nowitzki scored 29 points and had 13
rebounds and Steve Nash had 14 points and 11 assists, leading the
Mavericks at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Nash scored or assisted on Dallas' first 25 points, giving the
Mavericks an early nine-point lead as they avenged a loss at Madison
Square Garden a week ago that ended their 10-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Thomas, a Dallas native and former Maverick, scored a season-high
21 points.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 92, Miami 85--Damon Stoudamire scored 14 of his 20 points in
the fourth quarter and helped rally the Trail Blazers at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Rasheed Wallace and Bonzi Wells each scored 23 points for the Trail
Blazers, who overcame a 17-point deficit despite shooting only 39% from
the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Miami, which led 55-44 at halftime, scored only 30 points in the
second half.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 83, Houston 79--Karl Malone had 30 points and 10 rebounds as the
Jazz won at Utah, extending its home winning streak over the Rockets to
10 games.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Francis scored 27 points for Houston before being ejected early
in the third quarter.</TE>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Coach Phil Jackson canceled Thursday's practice, giving the Lakers
the run of the town for 24 hours.</LD>
<LD>   They might have asked if they couldn't trade it in for New York or
Boston down the line sometime, but they didn't.</LD>
<LD>   But it was the least Jackson could do, probably, given six consecutive
victories, the last three on a trip that was supposed to be the hard
part.</LD>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal limps so much before and after games you'd have to
stop yourself from offering to hold his arm, but then he had 20 points
and five blocked shots against Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant's legs flat left him in Indianapolis, where he was
out-dunked by 36-year-old Mitch Richmond, but then he dropped 31 points
and eight rebounds on the Pacers.</TE>
<TE>   Come the fourth quarter, the floor around the Laker bench is littered
with tape and padding and wraps and ice, which makes the Lakers no
different than every other team in the league by now.</TE>
<TE>   In recent fourth quarters, however, the Laker bench also is strewn
with Laker starters. In the past two games, the front five has played
three fourth-quarter minutes. In four games since O'Neal has come off the
injured list, the starters have played 15 of a possible 240
fourth-quarter minutes. O'Neal has played six of them.</TE>
<TE>   "Just more rest for me," he said gratefully Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, the Laker game has become more stable with O'Neal back in
it. He has averaged 24 points and 7.3 rebounds in his return, has shot
61.5% from the floor and 55.2% from the free-throw line, and the Lakers
have won the four games by an average of 25 points..</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Timberwolves don't play zone defense as much as they did early in
the season, Coach Flip Saunders said, but remain comfortable with it....
The Lakers were 22-10 through 32 games last season.... Minnesota sixth
man Anthony Peeler made seven of nine three-point shots Wednesday night
against Seattle. ... The technical foul charged to Robert Horry in
Toronto on Sunday was rescinded by the NBA on Thursday.</TE>

17 points in the first half, two in the second. Kevin Garnett was one for
nine from the floor in the second half. The Timberwolves are without
starters Joe Smith (calf) and Terrell Brandon (knee), and still have won
six in a row and nine of 10. They start Garnett and Gary Trent at
forward, Rasho Nesterovic at center, and Szczerbiak and Chauncey Billups
in the back court. The Timberwolves are 15-2 at home.</TE>

<HD>Kings Suffer Boston Bruising</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Playing its fourth game in six nights, weary L.A. is
overwhelmed in Bruins' 5-0 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>This was no crowning moment for the homecoming King.</LD>
<LD>   More like a crowning blow.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Allison, undoubtedly plotting a more triumphant return to the
FleetCenter on Thursday night, watched his plans go horribly awry.</LD>
<TE>   The all-star center, acquired by the Kings in an Oct. 24 trade after a
bitter contract holdout with the Boston Bruins, would have loved to show
the Bruins that they made a mistake in not meeting his contract demands
and sending him away.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, his every move was booed by the fans who used to adore him
and the Bruins breezed to a 5-0 victory, ending the Kings' four-game
winning streak while sending them to their most lopsided loss of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   What's worse, the players that came to the Bruins in the trade
combined for four points, Glen Murray contributing a goal and an assist
and Jozef Stumpel two assists as the streaking Bruins won for the ninth
time in 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   Allison, meanwhile, was a non-factor, failing to score for the fifth
time in six games in front of a crowd of 14,528 that included the
families of former King scouts Garnet "Ace" Bailey and Mark Bavis, killed
in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, surrounded by reporters in the locker room, Allison
expressed his disappointment in a barely audible monotone.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not very happy about this," he said after a lackluster effort
that included not one shot on goal in more than 19 minutes of ice time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disappointing to lose 5-0 any time, but especially when you're
facing the team you used to play for....We weren't even in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it's more bitter to face something like that."</TE>
<TE>   For Murray and Stumpel, of course, it was a lot more enjoyable.</TE>
<TE>   "Most definitely," said Murray, whose two points ran his total to 29
in 34 games since the trade, one fewer than Allison has scored in 35
games with the Kings. "You always want to beat your old team. To beat
them 5-0 is huge."</TE>
<TE>   Said Stumpel: "You always try to give it to your old team."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins, whose recent run has moved them to the top of the Eastern
Conference standings and improved their record since the trade to
21-9-1-4, gave it to the Kings from the start, exploiting the visitors'
fatigue.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, 15-13-6-1 since acquiring Allison, were playing their
second game in two nights and their fourth in six, and it showed.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked liked a tired team tonight," Coach Andy Murray said, "and
when you're a tired team you have to play a little smarter than what we
played tonight. When you don't, this can sometimes be the result."</TE>
<TE>   For King captain Mattias Norstrom, it left a bad taste.</TE>
<TE>   "We got outworked in every department," the defenseman said. "I don't
know what to call it--maybe a little sobering experience for us after
feeling really good about ourselves the way we played the last four
games....</TE>
<TE>   "It was a little wake-up call."</TE>
<TE>   It came early, Martin Lapointe beating goaltender Felix Potvin to give
the Bruins the only goal they would need only 4 minutes 45 seconds into
the game. Bill Guerin made the score 2-0 at 9:39 of the period, scoring
his 24th goal of the season on an assist from Stumpel, the 300th of his
NHL career.</TE>
<TE>   Murray picked up his 20th assist, on a goal by Sergei Samsonov, at
4:20 of the second period, then scored his 20th goal, off a pass from
Stumpel, to increase the Bruins' advantage to 4-0 with 5:34 to play in
the period. Joe Thornton scored his 19th goal in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, goaltenders Byron Dafoe and John Grahame combined to stop
16 shots, Grahame turning aside 12 over the last two periods after Dafoe
left the game during the first intermission because of flu-like symptoms.</TE>

<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>General Manager Pierre Gauthier says he will pursue a top player or
two, either through free agency or a trade, this off-season. Sounds good,
but as far as a trade is concerned, the Ducks are limited in what they
can offer.</LD>
<LD>  One area, though, where they have some depth is in goal.</LD>
<LD>   Jean-Sebastien Giguere is fulfilling the promise that made him a
first-round draft pick in 1995. Steve Shields has been solid, with only
Giguere's play keeping him from being in the lineup regularly. And coming
up behind them is 21-year-old Ilja Bryzgalov, who is living up to the
rave reviews he drew when the Ducks drafted him in the third round of the
2000 draft.</LD>
<TE>  Bryzgalov, playing for minor league Cincinnati, has a 1.31
goals-against average and a .964 save percentage in his last seven
starts.</TE>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Never mind the individual statistics, or that the Boston Bruins
have flourished since the Oct. 24 trade that brought Jason Allison and
Mikko Eloranta to the Kings and sent Glen Murray and Jozef Stumpel to the
Bruins.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings like the deal.</LD>
<LD>  "We got what we wanted," General Manager Dave Taylor said before
Thursday night's game. "What Jason brought to our team is what we
expected. He's a dominant, No. 1 center. We've had some great No. 1
centers in L.A. with [Wayne Gretzky] and Marcel Dionne  ... but not the
real physical presence we have with Jason.</LD>
<TE>  "He's very effective down low and around the front of the net and
behind, making plays. I like that aspect of the game. So, from that
standpoint, we're happy."</TE>
<TE>  Ditto, says his counterpart, Mike O'Connell.</TE>
<TE>  "Any trade, it's all about winning for me," the Bruin general manager
told the Boston Globe this week. "If you win, it's good. If you don't,
it's not good, and that's how you have to assess it. Put all the personal
points aside."</TE>

<HD>Injured Forsberg Out for 4 Months</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter Forsberg had surgery on his left foot Thursday and will miss
the Olympics and the rest of the NHL regular season, shocking Colorado
Avalanche teammates and coaches who expected him to rejoin the team
within days.</LD>
<LD>  Forsberg will be out for at least four months after the operation to
stabilize tendons on the outside of his left ankle. Team doctors said the
sheath around the tendons ruptured.</LD>
<LD>  "I was stunned," Avalanche General Manager Pierre Lacroix said. "It was
a real shocker for everyone involved in the discussions this morning.
Peter's conditioning was good. He was really fired up and really excited
about coming back."</LD>
<TE>  Lacroix said he had expected Forsberg to be back in the lineup within
10 to 15 days.</TE>
<TE>  Forsberg, who took an unexpected leave of absence from the team on
Sept. 15 because of mounting injuries, arrived in Denver this week from
his home in Sweden.</TE>
<TE>  Pittsburgh 2, Buffalo 0--Johan Hedberg stopped 36 shots as the Penguins
won at Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>  Mario Lemieux, the Penguin captain and owner, has missed 24 games since
undergoing hip surgery. He is expected to return Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 3, New Jersey 2--Jiri Dopita and Keith Primeau scored
within a 40-second span of the second period as the Flyers won their
fifth straight at home.</TE>
<TE>  Montreal 4, New York Islanders 0--Oleg Petrov and Mike Ribeiro scored
first period power-play goals and Jose Theodore stopped 26 shots at
Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 4, Edmonton 1--Bates Battaglia scored two goals as the
Hurricanes ended a three-game losing streak with a victory at Edmonton,
Canada.</TE>
<TE>  Minnesota 2, Nashville 2--Sergei Zholtok scored twice in the second
period as the Wild skated to a tie against the Predators at Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 2, Columbus 1--Eric Daze and Steve Dubinsky scored and Steve
Passmore stopped 20 shots for the Blackhawks at Chicago.</TE>

<TE>  St. Louis Blues forward Scott Young had laser surgery Thursday to
repair a retinal tear in his left eye. The Blues also said that

recovering from back spasms, will rejoin the team Saturday for St. Louis'
game at Pittsburgh.</TE>

<HD>Another Issue Annoys Packer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Billy Packer once called "60 Minutes" a cancer within CBS. Now CBS'
lead college basketball commentator is upset again at his network's
award-winning news magazine show.</LD>
<LD>   "It's beyond comprehension," Packer said Thursday. "Any time they do a
piece on college athletics, it's preposterous."</LD>
<LD>   It was a negative story on Jerry Tarkanian and the felons on his
Fresno State basketball team that got Packer's ire in 1998. This time it
was a story Lesley Stahl did that aired Sunday night.</LD>
<TE>   In Stahl's piece, Leo Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers
union, called the NCAA a sweatshop because of the way it treats college
athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the show was Ramogi Huma, a former UCLA linebacker and
co-founder of the College Athletes Coalition, which is seeking to change
some NCAA rules it regards as unfair.</TE>
<TE>   "What bothered me was that Lesley Stahl was so misinformed and so
ill-prepared to do that piece," Packer said.</TE>
<TE>   "Has she never heard of a Pell grant? Didn't someone think to have her
ask about it?"</TE>
<TE>   A Pell grant offers a stipend of up to $3,000 a year to
underprivileged college athletes.</TE>
<TE>   "Haven't they ever heard of Title IX?" Packer said. "If you pay male
football and basketball players, you're also going to have to pay women
soccer players.</TE>
<TE>   "And someone should have asked the guy from the steelworkers union how
many workers are left in the steel business," Packer said. "I'm from
Bethlehem, Pa., and know all about the steel industry and how the union
cost people their jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Packer's tirade came at the end of an interview about Saturday's
UCLA-Kansas game, which CBS will televise. Packer will work the noon game
with his old NBC partner, Dick Enberg.</TE>
<TE>   When the subject of the "60 Minutes" piece came up, Packer said, "I
thought that's why you called."</TE>
<TE>   He was ready to unload.</TE>
<TE>   "It's scary," he said, "and I feel sorry for America. If the other
stories on that show are as poorly done as the stories on college
athletics, then people in this country are being misled.</TE>
<TE>   "Why don't they ever invite me to one of their meetings when they're
going to do one of these stories? I just don't understand it."</TE>
<TE>Oh Yes, the Game</TE>
<TE>   As for Saturday's game, Packer thinks the Bruins will be facing a
tough test.</TE>
<TE>   "Even before Duke lost, I thought Kansas was the best team in the
country," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas is ranked No. 1, UCLA is ranked No. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's assignment gives Packer the opportunity to again work with
Enberg. There may never again be an announcing team as good as Enberg,
Packer and Al McGuire. That team was broken up when CBS wrested the NCAA
tournament away from NBC.</TE>
<TE>   Packer and Enberg worked two games together last season, and the
previous season they were reunited with McGuire on a Connecticut-Michigan
State game not long after Enberg signed with CBS. McGuire died about a
year later, on Jan. 26, 2001.</TE>
<TE>Going Prime Time</TE>
<TE>   Pro football works in prime time. "Monday Night Football," even though
it averaged an all-time low rating of 11.5 this season, still ranked
eighth among all prime-time programming.</TE>
<TE>   Just imagine how well playoff games would do in prime time.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL finally appears headed in that direction. Saturday's two
playoff games on ABC will start at 1:30 and 5 p.m., which is 4:30 and 8
p.m. in the East.</TE>
<TE>   CBS also gets a late game, 5 p.m. on the West Coast, on Jan. 19.</TE>
<TE>   Since television viewership rises later in the day, late starts are a
good thing for the league and ABC. More viewers mean higher ratings and
more advertising money.</TE>
<TE>   A later start is generally a good thing for viewers too. However, in
Saturday's case, it's not such a good thing for the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships at Staples Center. Because of the NFL playoff schedule, the
women's free skate final, the marquee event, has been moved to cable.</TE>
<TE>   The ABC Family Channel, formerly the Fox Family Channel, will carry
the women's final at 8 p.m.--live in the East and delayed three hours in
the West. ABC will show it on tape-delay the following day at 2 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The ABC Family Channel inherited the figure skating because of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The postponement of the NFL games the
following Sunday pushed the first round of playoffs ahead to this
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL reverts to a more conventional schedule on Sunday, which
doesn't exactly thrill the people at Fox.</TE>
<TE>   The early game, San Francisco at Green Bay, starts at 9:30 a.m., half
an hour earlier than games begin during the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Fox would prefer a later kickoff, much later.</TE>
<TE>   "The adjustment on Saturday is only half a loaf," said Fox Sports
President Ed Goren. "Hopefully, the experiment will be well received and
the league will take the next step."</TE>
<TE>   One thing Fox's John Madden advocates is playing the conference
championship games in prime time. "And I think each game should have its
own night," he said. "Play one on Saturday night and one on Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   "It would give those games what they deserve."</TE>
<TE>   This year's conference championship games will be played Sunday, Jan.
27, at 9:30 a.m. and 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   As for putting more playoff games in prime time in the future, NFL
spokesman Greg Aiello said, "Don't rule it out."</TE>
<TE>Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Ratings game: Fox reports that in head-to-head competition on Sundays
this season, its NFL pregame show averaged a 4.1 rating and beat the
combined rating of the pregame shows on CBS (2.7) and ESPN (1.3). Ratings
for NFL games on Fox this year were down 4%, CBS stayed the same and
ABC's "Monday Night Football" was off 11%.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Marathon, which has always been televised by Channel
13, is switching stations. Organizers have made a deal with Channel 9 to
televise the March 3 race. ... The Pepsi Softball Challenge, involving
such major league stars as Mike Piazza, Troy Glaus, Luis Gonzalez, Jason
Giambi, Jim Edmonds and Paul Lo Duca, will be played Sunday at noon at
Big League Dreams in Cathedral City and televised by NBC March 30.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis anyone? ESPN and ESPN2 will devote more than 50 hours to the
Australian Open, which begins Monday. Among the features to be shown
during the first week is an excellent one on Corina Morariu, an
outstanding doubles and mixed doubles player who is battling leukemia.
... Channel 56 is carrying Big West Conference basketball games on
Saturday nights, with Randy Rosenbloom and former Laker and UC Santa
Barbara Gaucho Don Ford announcing.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Olbermann will begin doing commentaries for ABC Radio Jan. 21
titled "Speaking of Sports" and "Speaking of Everything." To clarify an
item in this space last week, they will be Olbermann originals. A press
release was headlined, "Olbermann to anchor legendary Cosell
commentaries," but the reference was to the name of the shows, not the
commentaries done by the late Howard Cosell. ... Maybe resurrecting some
old Cosell material wouldn't be such a bad idea. Chris Myers has
suggested that he and Bob Golic bring back some of Jim Healy's old lines
and commentaries from his show on the old KMPC for their show on the new
KMPC (1540).</TE>
<TE>In Closing</TE>
<TE>   Talk about unappreciative. Former Trojan Brian Scalabrine, appearing
on KXTA (1150) with Dave Smith, Arnie Spanier and Chris Roberts
Wednesday, was asked how the crowds at the Sports Arena compared to the
crowds at Pauley Pavilion. "To hell with USC fans," Scalabrine said.</TE>

<LD>San Francisco (12-4) at Green Bay (12-4)</LD>
<LD>   9:30 a.m. Sunday, Channel 11</LD>
<LD>   The line: Green Bay by 3.</LD>
<TE>   Injuries: SF--DE John Engelberger (ankle), DE Chike Okeafor (leg), TE
Greg Clark (hamstring). GB--None.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Brett Favre is 30-0 at Lambeau Field when the temperature
at kickoff is 34 degrees or colder. The 49ers haven't won at Green Bay
since 1990. This will be the fifth time the teams have met in the
postseason since 1995. The Packers won the first three, and the 49ers won
a wild-card game three seasons ago at San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Key matchups: Defensive end Andre Carter vs. tackle Chad Clifton:
Carter has emerged as a pass-rushing force as a rookie; look for Clifton
to get blocking help from Packer fullback William Henderson. Green Bay
defensive linemen Cletidus Hunt and Gilbert Brown vs. offensive linemen
Derrick Deese and Ray Brown: Garrison Hearst has been running well behind
the left side--Brown and Deese--all season.</TE>
<TE>   When the 49ers have the ball: The 49ers have been running the ball
effectively all season with the one-two punch of Hearst and Kevan Barlow.
The Packers are vulnerable to the run because of injuries to LeRoy
Butler, Gilbert Brown and Nate Wayne. When the running game is effective,
quarterback Jeff Garcia excels at finding seams in defenses cheating to
slow the run. Terrell Owens, J.J. Stokes and Eric Johnson will present
Green Bay's secondary with matchup problems.</TE>
<TE>   When the Packers have the ball: The Packers need to run Ahman Green
off tackle, helping neutralize pass rushers Carter and Julian Peterson.
If the Packers fail to establish the run, the 49ers will blitz Favre with
abandon. Green Bay's passing game is hard to stop because Favre spreads
the ball around to as many as eight receivers.</TE>

<HD>Vikings Stick With Tice</HD>
<DH>NFL: Amid report he would hire O'Leary as assistant, Green's
successor promises that no player will loaf.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Mike Tice was hired as coach of the Minnesota Vikings on Thursday
and took firm control immediately, shaking up his staff amid a report
that he would hire disgraced George O'Leary as an assistant.</LD>
<LD>   Tice dismissed a fifth assistant, challenged starting quarterback
Daunte Culpepper to get better and promised that none of his players
would loaf.</LD>
<LD>   The St. Paul Pioneer Press, citing team sources, reported on its Web
site that Tice plans to make O'Leary his defensive line coach. O'Leary
coached Tice at Central Islip High in Long Island, N.Y.</LD>
<TE>   O'Leary, who quit five days after being hired as Notre Dame coach when
he was found to have lied on his resume, declined Thursday to confirm the
report in an interview with Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Pressed on whether he was discussing a job with Tice, O'Leary said:
"I've spoken to Michael, but I have not done anything at all with
Minnesota."</TE>
<TE>   He said he expected to talk to Tice again.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to listen to some people," O'Leary said. "Mike's one of the
ones I want to talk to."</TE>
<TE>   Tice didn't mention O'Leary at a news conference to introduce him as
the replacement for Dennis Green, and he wasn't available to reporters
later in the day.</TE>
<TE>   Tice, who coached the Vikings in their final game Monday, pledged a
quick return to success for the Vikings after a 5-11 season. He spoke
sternly, confidently and candidly about his vision for the team in a
manner rarely shown by his predecessor.</TE>
<TE>   Green was ousted last week, agreeing with owner Red McCombs on a
buyout of the two years left on his contract. McCombs alluded to the
perception that Green had lost control of the team.</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Randy Moss was a large part of that issue. He had his least
productive season, was fined several times by the league and the team,
and said twice that he plays hard only when he wants.</TE>
<TE>   Special teams coach Gary Zauner was let go Thursday.</TE>

<LD>Tampa Bay (9-7) at Philadelphia (11-5)</LD>
<LD>   1:30 p.m. Saturday, Channel 7</LD>
<LD>   The line: Philadelphia by 3.</LD>
<TE>   Injuries: TB--DT James Cannida (abdominal strain), DE Marcus Jones
(shoulder). PHI--DT Paul Grasmanis (knee), WR James Thrash (ankle/rib).</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Tampa Bay has made the playoffs four times in five
seasons, but that might not be enough to save Coach Tony Dungy's job. The
Buccaneers haven't won a road playoff game, and breaking that streak will
be tough in Philadelphia. Tampa Bay is 0-20 when the kickoff temperature
is below 40 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Key matchups: Buccaneer defensive end Simeon Rice vs. tackle Tra
Thomas: After a sluggish start, Rice had eight sacks in the last six
games. Thomas has size and speed to match Rice's agility. Keyshawn
Johnson vs. cornerback Troy Vincent: Both are physical, both are going to
the Pro Bowl. Derrick Brooks vs. Duce Staley: Brooks will be stalking
Staley from sideline to sideline.</TE>
<TE>   When the Buccaneers have the ball: When Eagle defensive tackle Hollis
Thomas went down with a freak foot injury two weeks ago, it further
weakened an already shaky run defense. Tampa Bay will pound Mike Alstott
up the middle behind rookie fullback Jameel Cook. Brad Johnson can beat
the blitz with a conservative game plan that keeps him under 30 pass
attempts. By using three-step drops with short routes to his three
primary receivers, Johnson can avoid turnovers and find holes in the
Eagle defense.</TE>
<TE>   When the Eagles have the ball: ,James Thrash, the Eagles' main deep
threat, likely will be shadowed by the cornerback duo of Ronde Barber and
Brian Kelly. So Donovan McNabb must make the most of his other options,
including running. By throwing underneath to Chad Lewis and Freddie
Mitchell, McNabb will draw John Lynch away from stacking up on the
running game.</TE>

<LD>New York Jets (10-6) at Oakland (10-6)</LD>
<LD>   5 p.m. Saturday, Channel 7</LD>
<LD>   The line: Oakland by 4</LD>
<TE>   Injuries: NYJ--none. OAK--RB Charlie Garner (foot), T Lincoln Kennedy
(shoulder), CB Charles Woodson (toe).</TE>
<TE>   Story line: A month after winning the AFC West title, the Raiders are
in disarray. They have lost three consecutive games; quarterback Rich
Gannon has criticized teammates for lacking discipline; and kicker
Sebastian Janikowski didn't play in last week's 24-22 loss to the
Jets--even though he told a TV sideline reporter he was healthy enough to
do so. That said, it will be awfully tough for the Jets to win in Oakland
a second time in less than a week.</TE>
<TE>   Key matchups: Garner vs. Jet linebackers: Garner caught 72 passes this
season, so look for Gannon to turn to him when in trouble. Defensive end
John Abraham vs. tackle Barry Sims: Abraham registered only one sack last
week but was in Gannon's face all afternoon. Wide receiver Wayne Chrebet
vs. cornerback Charles Woodson: This looks like a mismatch because
Woodson is a far better athlete. But Chrebet's ability to get open, his
soft hands and precise routes make him far more dangerous than he looks.</TE>
<TE>   When the Jets have the ball: New York will need better performances
from Vinny Testaverde and Curtis Martin to beat Oakland again. Martin's
running sets the tone. If he gets 25 carries and is effective, New York
probably will control the tempo. Testaverde needs to limit his mistakes
and make better use of his receivers.</TE>
<TE>   When the Raiders have the ball: With the league's 24th-ranked running
game, Gannon has frequently forced passes. The Raiders need to get power
running from Tyrone Wheatley and off-tackle bursts from Garner to take
advantage of a vulnerable Jet front seven. Gannon needs to spread the
ball more to keep the Jet defense guessing.</TE>

<HD>SEC's Top Receivers Leaving for Draft</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All-American wide receivers Josh Reed of Louisiana State and Jabar
Gaffney of Florida, along with Tennessee wideout Donte Stallworth, will
skip their final seasons of eligibility for the NFL draft.</LD>
<LD>  The trio of top receivers from the Southeastern Conference join an
already impressive list of underclassmen who are turning pro.</LD>
<LD>  Others who said Thursday they are leaving school early included
Michigan State running back T.J. Duckett  and Washington tight end
Jerramy Stevens.</LD>
<TE>  Several other undergraduates announced they were returning to school,
including All-American linebacker E.J. Henderson, Wisconsin wide receiver
Lee Evans and Penn State defensive tackle Jimmy Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>  Today is the deadline for players with remaining college eligibility to
decide whether they want to turn pro early.</TE>
<TE>  Reed, who caught 94 passes for 1,740 yards and seven touchdowns, is
expected to be a first-round pick. He won the Biletnikoff Award as the
nation's best receiver.</TE>
<TE>  Another player who has made himself available for the draft is Colorado
linebacker Jashon Sykes, a former Gardena Serra High standout.</TE>
<TE>  Sykes, who spent most of his senior season injured, will pursue an NFL
career instead of waiting to hear if he can play a fifth year for the
Buffaloes.</TE>
<TE>  Sykes sustained a herniated disk in his neck in October and sat out the
rest of the season. Colorado asked the NCAA to allow Sykes to play a
fifth year, but the NCAA has not issued a ruling.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Garrison Hearst hopes he is done with comebacks.</TE>
<TE>  Hearst was a runaway winner of the Associated Press NFL Comeback Player
of the Year award in balloting by writers and broadcasters who cover the
NFL. He received 47 of the 50 votes.</TE>
<TE>  "It's an award that I didn't really want to win again, but I'm happy,"
said Hearst, who has twice returned from career-threatening injuries to
resume his position as one of the league's elite running backs.</TE>
<TE>  Hearst rushed for 1,206 yards this season, his 10th in the NFL, with
four 100-yard games and four touchdowns as part of a formidable rushing
tandem with rookie Kevan Barlow. Hearst also caught 41 passes, filling
the multiple roles demanded of a running back in the West Coast offense.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Defensive back R.W. McQuarters signed a five-year, $21-million contract
extension with the Chicago Bears, a deal that could keep him with the
team through 2006.</TE>
<TE>  The contract includes a $6 million signing bonus for McQuarters, who
came to the Bears in a trade from the 49ers two years ago.</TE>
<TE>  This season, McQuarters became a starter and play maker for the Bears,
who went 13-3 and won the NFL Central Division title.</TE>
<TE>   He intercepted three passes, made 89 tackles and returned a fumble 69
yards for a TD against Arizona.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  New England Patriot wide receiver Terry Glenn was suspended for the
playoffs after repeatedly missing practices and meetings.</TE>
<TE>  Patriot spokesman Stacey James announced the suspension, saying Glenn
was guilty of "multiple unexcused absences." It was the third suspension
for Glenn this season.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Pittsburgh Steeler wide receiver Plaxico Burress missed a court
appearance in Cleveland after being cited for carrying an open alcoholic
beverage container on a downtown street.</TE>
<TE>  Burress, 24, was cited Dec. 24 in the city's Warehouse nightclub
district, said police spokeswoman Lt. Sharon MacKay.</TE>
<TE>  He was scheduled to be in Cleveland Municipal Court on Wednesday but
didn't show up, MacKay said.</TE>
<TE>  George Yarbrough, a court spokesman, said a warrant was issued
directing Burress to arrange another court date.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Tennessee Titan quarterback Steve McNair and running back Eddie George
had arthroscopic surgery.</TE>
<TE>  McNair had bone spurs removed from his shoulder to give the quarterback
more room in his throwing shoulder around the rotator cuff.</TE>
<TE>  George had his right ankle cleaned out to alleviate the pain that
plagued him throughout the season. He should be able to run again in
eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>  George had a tendon in his right toe reconstructed last February.</TE>

<LD>Baltimore (10-6) at Miami (11-5)</LD>
<LD>   1 p.m. Sunday, Channel 2</LD>
<LD>   The line: Miami by 2.</LD>
<TE>   Injuries: BAL--CB James Trapp (groin), DE Rob Burnett (calf). MIA--WR
Chris Chambers (ankle), WR Oronde Gadsden (hamstring), FB Rob Konrad
(rib).</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Baltimore had to win two playoff games on the road last
season in its march to the Super Bowl, so visiting Pro Player Stadium
shouldn't be daunting. But Miami went 7-1 at home this season and has won
five of six home playoff games. Both teams rely on defense.</TE>
<TE>   Key matchups: Defensive end Peter Boulware vs. tackle Todd Wade: Since
his shift to end, Boulware has 9.5 sacks in six games. Chris Chambers vs.
Duane Starks: Chambers is Miami's lone big-play threat; Starks is small
and smart. Running back Terry Allen vs. linebacker Zach Thomas: Allen is
fresh and appears to be peaking. Thomas, nursing neck and shoulder
injuries, is Miami's emotional leader.</TE>
<TE>   When the Ravens have the ball: Baltimore has returned to the same
trudging offense it relied on for last season's Super Bowl run. Elvis
Grbac is facing a secondary that is among the league's best. Miami's
defensive linemen and linebackers are battered, though, and if the Ravens
establish a consistent ground game, Grbac will be able to deliver the
ball to Qadry Ismail and Shannon Sharpe.</TE>
<TE>    When the Dolphins have the ball: It is a mystery to opposing
defensive coordinators why talented running back Travis Minor and
receiver Chambers aren't more involved. Lamar Smith's bruising style led
the Dolphins to the playoffs in 2000, but poor offensive line play and
overwork kept Smith under 1,000 yards this season. Quarterback Jay
Fiedler is a leader and smart. But with no running game or time to throw,
his effectiveness is limited.</TE>

<HD>Harvick Stretched His Hit Season Into a Double</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Kevin Harvick, an untested 25-year-old rookie from
Bakersfield, was named to replace the legendary Dale Earnhardt as driver
of Richard Childress' GM Goodwrench Chevrolet after Earnhardt's tragic
crash in the Daytona 500, hardly anyone expected Harvick to continue his
quest for the Busch Grand National championship.</LD>
<LD>   It would mean hopscotching around the country, often driving the Busch
car at one track and the Winston Cup car at another on the same weekend,
once at tracks as far apart as Pikes Peak, Colo., and Pocono, Pa. It
would mean running 68 races, 35 Winston Cup and 33 Busch.</LD>
<LD>   No one had ever run a full schedule for both NASCAR series. No one
thought it feasible.</LD>
<TE>   "I felt I had to do it because of all the effort the Busch crew had
made, getting the car ready for the season and looking forward to
racing," Harvick said. "Looking back on last year, even though I drove my
first Winston Cup season, the Busch championship means more to me than
anything because people said we couldn't do both, that I needed to
concentrate entirely on the Cup after getting the ride in Dale's car."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, at the Busch awards banquet in the Regent Beverly Wilshire,
Harvick and the Childress team will collect $1.8 million for winning the
championship. Harvick also finished ninth in Winston Cup and was named
rookie of the year, despite missing the opening race at Daytona.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an amazing year, I know I'll never go through one like it
again in my life," Harvick said. "The pressure wasn't only on the track,
but it was all around me. Richard [Childress] told me from Day 1 what it
would be like--the media attention, the fans, the critics, the demands by
sponsors for my time, stuff like that.</TE>
<TE>   "The year went by so fast, rushing from one race to another, from one
meeting to another, having microphones stuck in my face before I even got
out of the car. I'm just now beginning to realize how much we did, how
much we accomplished."</TE>
<TE>   As a Winston Cup driver, in Earnhardt's car, the color changed from
black to white and the number from 3 to 29, Harvick won his third time
out, at Atlanta, and finished with another victory at Chicago. He had six
top-five finishes and 16 top-10s, earning $4.3 million. No one had ever
won a race so soon after joining NASCAR's toughest series.</TE>
<TE>   As a Busch driver, in the No. 2 AC Delco Chevrolet, he had five
victories, 20 top-five finishes and 24 in the top 10, winning nearly
$920,000.</TE>
<TE>   And he also found time to marry DeLana Neville, on Feb. 28, only seven
days after being told by Childress that he would drive Earnhardt's car.</TE>
<TE>   When someone suggested that his life had been pretty hectic, Harvick
laughed and said, "Hectic? That's not even the half of it."</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 season will start early for him, however. He will share a
Corvette with Rick Carelli, Dave Liniger and John Metcalf in the 40th
annual Rolex 24-hour race at Daytona on Feb. 2-3, then begin practicing
for his first IROC race and Daytona 500 on Feb. 6.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm cutting back this year," Harvick said, grinning. "After the
24-hour, I'll run 36 Winston Cup races, along with four IROC, three
Busch, five Craftsman truck and one Southwest Tour.</TE>
<TE>   "I just love to race, plain and simple. Give me a bicycle or a wagon
for that matter and I'll race it."</TE>
<TE>AARWBA Banquet</TE>
<TE>   J. C. Agajanian would have been 89 in June. He has been gone since
1984, dying the day practice started for the Indianapolis 500, a treasure
he won twice, with Troy Ruttman and Parnelli Jones.</TE>
<TE>   In a way, Aggie will be honored Saturday night when the Agajanian
family--J.C.'s three boys, Cary, J.C. Jr. (or Jay) and Chris--are feted
at the American Auto Racing Writers &amp; Broadcasters Assn. awards dinner at
the Sheraton Suites Fairplex in Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   Like their father, none of them raced themselves, but all have been
heavily involved in motor racing for most of their lives. The family
patriarch, James T. "Pappy' Agajanian, forbade his 18-year-old son J.C.
to drive race cars, and the tradition was carried on through the family.</TE>
<TE>   Cary, 60, is a Los Angeles attorney, part owner of an Indy car and a
Busch series car, and manages a number of prominent drivers, among them
Tony Stewart, Ron Hornaday, Dave Blaney and Billy Boat. With Mike Curb,
he owns a Busch car driven last year by Jay Sauter and also is one of the
owners of Boat's Indy car, which finished fourth in Indy Racing League
points last year.</TE>
<TE>   Jay, 52, keeps the Agajanian interest alive in the annual Turkey Night
Midget Grand Prix, conducted the last three years at Irwindale Speedway.
The family has promoted Turkey Night since J.C. brought it to Ascot Park
in 1960 and A.J. Foyt was the winner.</TE>
<TE>   Chris, 50, promotes flat-track motorcycle races and recently sold his
company to Clear Channel, but remains as a consultant.</TE>
<TE>   J.C. was a charter member of AARWBA's Legends in Racing Hall of Fame,
and Saturday his sons will be honored as "Pioneers in Racing."</TE>
<TE>   Former land-speed record holder Craig Breedlove and Indy car
owner-promoter Andy Granatelli will be inducted into the Hall of Fame.
Also honored will be members of the AARWBA All-American team. Expected to
attend are drag racers Kenny Bernstein and John Force, Indy Lights
champion Townsend Bell, Trans-Am winner Paul Gentilozzi and off-road
racing champion Rob MacCachran.</TE>
<TE>   Three All-Americans, Stewart, Danny Lasoski and Dave Darland, will
miss the dinner because they will be in Tulsa, Okla., to drive in the

<TE>   What is it about things that happened 50 years ago that seems so
interesting today? There has been no end of books and articles about
racing in the '50s. The latest is Art Evans' regional work, "The Fabulous
Fifties: Sports Car Races in Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   As a sequel to his earlier book, also titled "The Fabulous Fifties,"
the new 230-page edition contains reproductions of race programs with
text as to the outcome. The first book was a collection of personality
sketches of racing people from the '50s. The new one expands Evans' work
in what he calls "the seat of the American car culture."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who remembers racing at Torrey Pines, Hourglass, Santa Barbara,
Palm Springs, Catalina or 15 other sports car venues from that era will
enjoy the book. Evans, 68, is a former racer-photographer from Redondo
Beach who was an active participant in "the fabulous '50s." Besides maps
and diagrams showing where the races were run, Evans has pictures showing
the areas today, some sites now shopping malls or golf courses. Only
Willow Springs remains as a sports car racing site.</TE>
<TE>   Books are $65, plus $5 for shipping from Photo Data Research, 800 S.

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The horse-of-the-year announcement won't be made until Feb. 18, but
preliminary voting points to Point Given dethroning Tiznow as national
champion.</LD>
<LD>   Finalists for all of the 2001 Eclipse awards, the highest honors in
thoroughbred racing, were announced Thursday, and Point Given, the best
3-year-old male, was the only unanimous choice after 230 ballots were
counted.</LD>
<LD>   Tiznow, one of three finalists for horse of the year, is expected to
win the Eclipse for best older male, a division in which Sakhee and Lido
Palace are also finalists.</LD>
<TE>   Besides Point Given and Tiznow, the other horse-of-the-year finalist
is the Irish-based Johannesburg, who won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at
Belmont Park in his only U.S. start after winning six consecutive races
in England, Ireland and France. A horse needs to run once in North
America to be eligible for an Eclipse.</TE>
<TE>   A tendon injury ended Point Given's career after trainer Bob Baffert's
colt won the Travers in late August for his sixth win in seven 2001
starts.</TE>
<TE>   Point Given, who towered over the other 3-year-olds, ran fifth in the
Kentucky Derby, but won everything else, including the Preakness and the
Belmont Stakes, the other races in the Triple Crown.</TE>
<TE>   With Point Given sidelined, Tiznow beat Sakhee, the British import, by
a nose in what will go down as one of the most memorable of the Breeders'
Cup Classics. Tiznow, who also has been retired, is the only horse to win
the Classic twice. The 4-year-old colt had physical problems too and won
only one other Grade I stake, the Santa Anita Handicap in March, and
before his Breeders' Cup win went seven months without a victory. Point
Given finished with five Grade I races, the last four in $1-million
stakes.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Point Given, Tiznow and Johannesburg, two other horses--Xtra
Heat and Tranquility Lake--received two mentions. Xtra Heat, who won nine
races but lost three of four starts in Grade I stakes, is a finalist
among 3-year-old fillies and in the sprint division. Beaten by half a
length by Squirtle Squirt in the Breeders' Cup Sprint, her best chance
appears to be in the filly division.</TE>
<TE>   Tranquility Lake is a finalist for awards on both dirt and grass among
older fillies and mares. The 6-year-old mare won on both surfaces, but
late in the year she was second to Janet on grass in the Yellow Ribbon
and ran ninth on dirt in the Breeders' Cup Distaff.</TE>
<TE>   Prince Ahmed Salman's Thoroughbred Corp., which bred and raced Point
Given, is a finalist for best owner and best breeder, as is Prince Khalid
Abdullah's Juddmonte Farms, which won Grade I races with five horses,
including Banks Hill in the Breeders' Cup Filly &amp; Mare Turf.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bienamado, one of the best grass horses in the country before his
season ended with a seventh-place finish in the Arlington Million in
August, was back in training with trainer Paco Gonzalez at Santa Anita,
but he injured a suspensory ligament and has been retired to stud. Bred
by Trudy McCaffery and John Toffan and raced by them in a partnership
that included Robert Sangster, Bienamado had eight wins and three seconds
in 16 starts and earned $1.2 million. ... Twelve horses are entered to
run in the $200,000 San Fernando Stakes at Santa Anita on Saturday. The
lineup, in post-position order: Discreet Hero, Momentum, Mo Mon, Sigreto,
Reef Diver, Western Pride, I Love Silver, Stormin' Heaven, Fancy As, Pie
N Burger, Bring Home Thegold and Orientate.</TE>

<DL>ENSENADA, Mexico</DL>
<LD>The morning sun is providing warmth not felt around this Baja
California city in weeks, and it brings a smile to the face of
Enedina-Damian Albarrez.</LD>
<LD>   The mother of five has reason to smile. Eight months ago, her family
lived within cardboard walls in a riverbed on the outskirts of town. Now,
thanks to the Rotary Club of Ensenada, they live in an actual house that
won't wash away when the big rains come.</LD>
<LD>   And on this particular day, thanks to a helping hand extended by Bob
Fletcher and the San Diego Rotary Club, Albarrez's smile is especially
bright.</LD>
<TE>   Her family is among hundreds of Ensenada's poor families receiving
visits, and packages of food, from members of both clubs as part of
Fletcher's "Fish Across the Border" program.</TE>
<TE>   Fletcher is widely known as the hard-working president of the
Sportfishing Assn. of California, which represents the interests of
fleets from Morro Bay to San Diego. But many landing operators, and
certainly most of the anglers they cater to, don't realize he is equally
dedicated as a humanitarian.</TE>
<TE>   "He is one of those inspirational guys who makes other people better
by just knowing him," says Christopher Cramer, a San Diego brewery owner
taking part in this year's Fish Across the Border tour. "He is the one
who inspires our club to do this sort of outreach program."</TE>
<TE>   Fletcher started Fish Across the Border eight years ago, he says, "As
a way of showing Mexico my appreciation for the good relationship our
fishing industry has had with them. But beyond that, the program enables
us to put food directly into the hands of those that need it most."</TE>
<TE>   Southland anglers have a role in the program: They have the option of
donating some or all of the tuna they catch aboard long-range vessels
running from Fisherman's Landing in San Diego. This year, Fletcher
collected a record 137 cases of tuna, or 6,576 cans.</TE>
<TE>   The cans go into packages for the needy, assembled and distributed,
once a year, by the Ensenada Rotary Club. "This is our only reward,"
Fletcher says, between deliveries. "Seeing these people smile like this
is all the thanks we need."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The smiles begin during handshakes when members of the two rotary
clubs meet, as they do for one Saturday every January, in downtown
Ensenada to plan and execute their deliveries.</TE>
<TE>   Fletcher, his wife Anne, and his group have formed a close bond with
Eloy Perez, Julio Casas and other leading members of the Ensenada Rotary
Club.</TE>
<TE>   And the smiles begin anew at the Fish Across the Border tour's first
stop: Albergue San Vicente, a downtown shelter for migrant workers down
on their luck. Clothing is dropped by the pile; it'll be given to those
staying at the shelter or sold to buy food and medicine.</TE>
<TE>   The stop has become a Fish Across the Border tradition and on this
trip, during a brief ceremony in a shady courtyard, Fletcher is asked to
accept a plaque, from Sister Hortensia Dacosta, proclaiming him an Amigo
Del Albergue, a friend of the shelter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a beautiful thing that they do because we struggle so to support
this place," Dacosta says, explaining that the facility houses
individuals or families for 10 days, "or until we can find them a job or
another room."</TE>
<TE>   The drop-off is completed quickly because there is work to be done in
the valleys and hills.</TE>
<TE>   While some of the trucks have traveled to the truly destitute parts of
the city, where children are little more than skin and bones, Casas has
directed Fletcher and his caravan to an area southeast of the city where
a community of 25 small homes has been established in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Casas, president-elect of the Ensenada Rotary Club, wants to show the
San Diego Rotarians the progress that has been made in the last year at
Colonia Santo Tomas--where the Albarrez family now lives--thanks in part
to their donations.</TE>
<TE>   The last house was completed three months ago. All are wired for
electricity but it is up to the families to pay the bills and provide
general upkeep. Each family has a Rotarian mentor who visits once a
month. Social workers try to find work for the men and, in some cases,
the women.</TE>
<TE>   The families can stay as long as they wish but they do not own the
property. Rarely has anyone been evicted, but Perez, a physician known
for his humanitarian efforts, acknowledges that it has happened.</TE>
<TE>   "Once," he says, "we had to evict a woman because she became a
prostitute and started bringing her clients here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Things are fairly quiet in the community, even for a Saturday. Many of
the men are working in the city. Children are buzzing around on bicycles,
which seems odd until it is explained that the bikes, for the most part,
are gifts from Rotarians.</TE>
<TE>   Colonia Santo Tomas is a work in progress. Its school, teaching grades
one through six, has grown in one year from a shack made of palettes to a
four-room facility complete with brick walls, chalkboards, school chairs
and tables.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the rooms a colorful Christmas tree made of paper is glued
to the wall, decorated with paper ornaments bearing the names of students
who made them.</TE>
<TE>   A map of North America has a prominent place on the wall, as does a
report detailing the evils of tobacco. Outside, the foundation of a
playground has been laid, alongside a rotting wooden lavatory.</TE>
<TE>   Casas explains that a sewer system will be built for the houses and
the school as soon as enough funds are raised.</TE>
<TE>   "School is not mandatory here," he adds, continuing his tour. "So
without this school, these children here would not have a chance at an
education."</TE>
<TE>   Others have fanned out into the community, going door to door with
their packages. Some of the residents appear embarrassed to be accepting
these gifts of sustenance, opening their doors only slightly, taking the
bags or baskets, bowing their heads in appreciation, then slipping back
inside.</TE>
<TE>   But others are outgoing and openly thankful. Albarrez is one such
person. She has stepped out into her small dirt yard, her children at her
heels, to greet her visitors with open arms.</TE>
<TE>   In the two packages she accepts from Fletcher are such staples as
beans, flour, cornmeal and sugar, along with some cookies for the kids
and, of course, several cans of tuna. Her family will be well-fed for a
week, maybe longer.</TE>
<TE>   After making small talk with the Rotarians, Albarrez sweeps her
youngest child in her arms and invites a reporter to follow her inside
for a tour of her house.</TE>
<TE>   The tour is a brief one. There are no lights. She flips a switch and
explains, through a translator, that although her husband has found work
as a bricklayer, they cannot yet afford electricity.</TE>
<TE>   It's clean but somewhat dank inside the one-room house. Just inside
the door is a working stove fueled by propane. A few feet away is a small
table for dining.</TE>
<TE>   At the opposite end of the room, about 20 feet away, is a bed for
Albarrez and her husband. There is no bed for the children, although
Albarrez points to a large stained mattress standing against the wall,
and then to the cold concrete floor next to the bed. The mattress is put
on the floor each night so the children have something soft to sleep on.</TE>
<TE>   Albarrez's smile disappears briefly as she explains that three of her
children, two boys and a girl, are sent to the orphanage in town for five
days each week, because at the orphanage, she knows, they'll be fed and
cared for. But at least they always have a real roof over their heads,
she says, smiling again.</TE>
<TE>   For the "saints" who have given her family a chance to live like human
beings, she has nothing but praise.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been here eight months and couldn't be more grateful," she says.
"Before, our home was lined with cardboard and we couldn't keep the water
out. Whenever it would rain, we'd all get very wet and cold."</TE>
<TE>   On this day, there are no such concerns. A warm front is moving
through.</TE>

<LD>After scoring one perfect score of 6.0 Thursday night, Naomi Lang
and Peter Tchernyshev seem well on the way to their fourth consecutive
U.S. Figure Skating national championship and their first Olympic berth
after the first two rounds of the ice dancing competition at Staples
Center.</LD>
<LD>   Lang, of Allegan, Mich., and Tchernyshev, a transplanted Russian who
became an American citizen last year, drew the small crowd to its feet
with their moves choreographed to the original dance, the Spanish Medley.
Their perfect score came on the presentation mark.</LD>
<LD>   The original dance is worth 30% of the final score. Each couple
Thursday could chose their own music but the interpretation had to fit
the rhythm and tempo of the Spanish Medley.</LD>
<TE>   In second place are 17-year-old Canadian Tanith Belbin and 19-year-old
Benjamin Agosto of Beverly Hills, Mich. The U.S. will send two ice
dancing teams to the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, but because Belbin
is not a U.S. citizen, the couple are ineligible.</TE>
<TE>   Beata Handra, 25, of San Francisco, and Charles Sinek, 33, of
Lexington, Mass., are in third place and would qualify for the Olympics
if they remain there. Handra and Sinek never have finished better than
fourth at nationals.</TE>
<TE>   The surprising fourth-place couple, Melissa Gregory and Dennis
Petukhov, also are not eligible for the Olympics because Petukhov is not
a U.S. citizen. That leaves Jessica Joseph and Brandon Forsyth, the
fifth-place couple, to battle Handra and Sinek for the second spot.</TE>

<BD>Paul Wylie, a five-time medalist at the U.S. Figure
SkatingChampionships and a silver medalist at the 1992 Olympic Games,
analyzes this week's championships at Staples Center for The Times, as
told to Senior Assistant Sports Editor Randy Harvey</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Skating through a yellow sea of stuffed Chevrolet logos thrown onto
the ice, you are 30 years old and taking the ice for your last
performance at a national championship. A berth on the Olympic team and a
national title are at stake and all you hear is, "5.9, 5.8, 5.9, 5.8
...," those are the scores for Timothy Goebel, who was tied with you for
first place after the short program.</LD>
<LD>   You think to yourself, "Wow, they sure left \o7 me\f7  a lot of room."</LD>
<LD>   And then you think to yourself, "The guy who skates after I do, Johnny
Weir, was 7 years old when I won my first national title."</LD>
<TE>   This is what might have been running through Todd Eldredge's mind as
he steadied himself to go on to the ice Thursday night for his long
program.</TE>
<TE>   But he skated with intensity, speed and command of the ice unmatched
by any competitor. His cat-like landing of his triple-axel double-toe
combination and six other triple jumps, including another text book
triple-axle, belied the fact that he was missing anything technically.</TE>
<TE>   He was.</TE>
<TE>   There was no quadruple jump in his program, and he needs one to
compete in Salt Lake City with Evgeni Plushenko and Alexi Yagudin. He
knows that. But his goals here were to make the Olympic team and win the
national title. He did that.</TE>
<TE>   Goebel skated an easygoing, jazzy rendition of "American in Paris,"
performing a seemingly effortless quad-triple combination and two
beautiful triple axles. He has made real progress in his style and
posture.</TE>
<TE>   For him to win in the Olympics, detractors will say he needs to
command the ice more--skate faster, get his shoulders back even more. But
there was risk-taking in his programs. Don't forget his short program,
with a quad-triple combination and a triple-axle. He's the best American
jumper since Brian Boitano.</TE>
<TE>   Although he didn't win here, Goebel's approach might serve him better
in Salt Lake City, where judges will insist on a quad.</TE>
<TE>   The same can also be said for Michael Weiss. It appeared he had a very
checkered nationals, with two bad mistakes in his short program and a
fall and a stumble in his long program. He, however, has got mileage
under his quads. That might help him land them in the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Landing eight triples and a quad or eight triples and two quads in the
long program is like trying to solve a difficult math problem. You know
you can do addition and subtraction, but you need to push yourself to do
calculus.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever deciphers the quad and delivers a passionate, commanding
performance in Salt Lake City will be the one to challenge Plushenko and
Yagudin.</TE>
<TE>   Any of the three U.S. men can do that. But they have to concentrate in
the next month, Eldridge on landing the quad and Goebel and Weiss on
skating with the fire of an Olympic champion.</TE>

<LD>It is now a rite of January: Athletes of both genders are brought
together for a major athletic competition in which the women overshadow
the men in everything from charisma to Q ratings to number of Web site
hits, although the men have taken the lead when it comes to outlandish
costuming.</LD>
<LD>   But we'll have more about the Australian Open in next week's editions.</LD>
<LD>   You may have read how Pete Sampras dumped his agent, then rehired him,
all within a matter of hours. Happens with figure skaters and their
coaches all the time.</LD>
<TE>   Andre Agassi dropped off the face of the tennis map for a couple
years, then climbed 140 places in the world rankings to reclaim No. 1
weeks before his 30th birthday. Thursday night at the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships at Staples Center, 30-year-old Todd Eldredge, who took two
years off from world-class competition, returned to the winners' podium
with his sixth national championship, earning him a trip to his third
Olympic Games.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis and figure skating have more in common than either would like
to admit. Tennis might find the concept of a kiss-and-cry area a bit
strange, but have you ever sat in on a post-match interview session with
Jeff Tarango? No male tennis player would be caught dead in a sequined
pirate outfit at Center Court, but the so-called future of the American
men's tennis, Andy Roddick, routinely turns out in black socks, white
shorts and a white baseball cap worn backward.</TE>
<TE>   They're mirror images at this stage, all the way down to the backseat
they now share whenever the women are on the same marquee.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't used to be that way with tennis, but take a look at the
defending French, Wimbledon and U.S. Open champions. On the women's side,
it's Jennifer Capriati and Venus Williams. For the men, it's Gustavo
Kuerten, Goran Ivanisevic and Lleyton Hewitt. If you're publishing a
national sports magazine, which faces are going to grace your cover?</TE>
<TE>   Figure skating has been this way for decades, and Thursday was just
the latest chapter in a large volume.</TE>
<TE>   In the women's short program in the early afternoon, the top seven
finishers skated cleanly, and Michelle Kwan discovered she doesn't have
enough shoulders over which to view all the legitimate challengers to her
crown. Sasha Cohen here, Sarah Hughes there, Angela Nikodinov making a
strong case for a four-women U.S. Olympic team. That's one more than
what's permitted, setting up Saturday's women's free skate as a
suspenseful, painful cut-down day.</TE>
<TE>   The men? Eldredge won because he skated conservatively and managed to
stay on his feet. The oldest man in the field, and he's the only one in
the final group who didn't take a seat.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's national champion Timothy Goebel? Tried a quad, had a
fall.</TE>
<TE>   Two-time national titlist Michael Weiss? Tried another quad, had
another fall.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Savoie, Johnny Weir, Derrick Delmore? Fall, fall, fall.</TE>
<TE>   They should have billed this one: Old Man Todd and the Legends of the
Fall.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, once the many ice shavings had been swept off the many
costumes, 2002 Olympians Eldredge, Goebel and Weiss gathered in the
interview room.</TE>
<TE>   Second question: "Todd, excuse me for raining on your parade at this
moment. Is there anything that happened here these two days that should
make the Russians even the slightest bit fearful of one of you
challenging them for a gold medal?"</TE>
<TE>   Tough crowd. But then, when you spend a half hour watching the best
and brightest of American men's figure skating resurface the ice with
their backsides, it puts you in a kind of mood.</TE>
<TE>   Eldredge paused to let the question soak in. He laughed and answered,
no, not off this performance--although the potential, he added, was
there.</TE>
<TE>   Goebel conceded that none of the three qualifiers had "skated our
best," but promised to go back to the practice rink and work hard for the
next month.</TE>
<TE>   Someone else asked the group if they were "frustrated" by being
overshadowed by the women who had preceded them onto the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've been overshadowed by the women for years," said
Eldredge, smiling along with the obvious truth.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss then leaned into his microphone and, mimicking a first-grader
comparing lunch boxes, quipped, "But \o7 our \f7 program was on live TV.
Where were the ladies?"</TE>
<TE>   The ladies had been tape-delayed for prime time viewing on ABC
Saturday, their short program serving as a scene setter for the decisive
free skate--and isn't this where we all came in four years ago, waiting
and waiting and waiting for yesterday's footage from Nagano tomorrow?</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, live television could be overrated. The U.S. men
got their moment in the live spotlight Thursday night, and what did they
do with it?</TE>
<TE>   Probably inspired a lot of young American boys with gold medal dreams
to throw away their skates and start to think seriously about taking a
different track to the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis, anyone?</TE>

<HD>Their Teaming Has Them Dreaming of the Olympics</HD>
<DH>Pairs: Kalesavich and Parchem, seemingly an odd couple, are second
going into long program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was no reason to think Stephanie Kalesavich and Aaron Parchem
would be a dream pair.</LD>
<LD>   Kalesavich was a tiny tot, barely 5 feet tall, a 15-year-old with a
little voice and big dreams. Parchem was a 22-year-old college student,
5-10, a confident, outgoing adult.</LD>
<LD>   There is no explaining what convinced the coaches at the Detroit
Skating Club two years ago to pluck Kalesavich, with her bouncy blond
ponytail, from one side of the ice and put her in the arms of Parchem, an
African American who stands out in the crowd of skaters because of his
race but fits in nicely because of his love of the cold, slippery
surface.</LD>
<TE>   It was just a feeling, said Mitch Moyer, one of the coaches. It was a
sense that the little girl and grown man would teach each other
something. And sometimes feelings are right.</TE>
<TE>   Kalesavich, 17, and Parchem, 24, are the surprise second-place pair
going into tonight's long program of the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships. Their solid short program, free of major mistakes, left
them behind two-time defending champions Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman.</TE>
<TE>   After finishing fourth at last year's nationals, their first as a
senior pair, Kalesavich, a senior in high school, and Parchem, who is
finishing work on an economics degree at Detroit Mercy, are just ahead of
Tiffany Scott and Philip Dulebohn, last year's runners-up. In fourth
place are Detroit rinkmates Danielle and Steve Hartsell, who won the 1999
U.S. title but who have fought injuries the last two seasons. The U.S.
can send two pairs to the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a relatively new development for us, thinking about [the
Olympics]," Parchem said. "This is not something we are worried about. We
need to come out and skate well for two programs."</TE>
<TE>   Parchem, who grew up in Oak Park, Ill., played every sport imaginable.
Soccer, baseball, basketball, football. His mother, Georga, took Parchem
to a local ice rink when he was 12. This is a late start for a potential
world-class skater, but Parchem wasn't thinking Olympics or national
championships. He was thinking, "Wow, I really love to jump on the ice."</TE>
<TE>   As he headed to high school, Parchem kept up with skating and soccer.
"When I got to high school, I knew I had to pick one sport," Parchem
said. "Everybody expected me to pick soccer. But I liked skating."</TE>
<TE>   Kalesavich and Parchem had other partners. "But it wasn't working well
for either of us," Parchem said.</TE>
<TE>   In their short time together, Kalesavich and Parchem have finished
fifth at Skate Canada and sixth at the 2001 Goodwill Games and NHK
Trophy. "It's been kind of a fast progression," Parchem said. "Are we
surprised? Yeah, probably."</TE>
<TE>   Ina and Zimmerman, the big favorites, had a huge mistake in their
short program when Zimmerman fell hard on his side-by-side triple
toe-loop jump.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have the confidence," Zimmerman said. "I didn't believe in
myself when I went into it. But it's only one of eight elements, and you
have to make the program come to life after that."</TE>
<TE>   Zimmerman is skating with a splint on one finger. He sheepishly
admitted Wednesday night after the short program that the finger was
broken last month while he was tossing a football around. "I guess I'd
better tell the truth now," Zimmerman said with a sidelong glance at Ina,
a notorious taskmaster and hard-nosed competitor. Ina smiled. A little.</TE>
<TE>   Scott and Dulebohn missed the entire Grand Prix season while Dulebohn
recovered from a stress fracture in his back.</TE>

<LD>It's an exaggeration to say 17-year-old Sasha Cohen has tried more
quadruple jumps than 30-year-old Todd Eldredge, newly crowned men's U.S.
champion. But not by much.</LD>
<LD>   At these U.S. Figure Skating Championships at Staples Center, it has
been the women who have skated with more guts and more authority and who
proved again why women's figure skating rules the Winter Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Until Thursday afternoon, the enormousness of the occasion (the U.S.
championships, which are the Olympic trials) combined with the playing
field (ice) and the elements (jumping on ice) had mostly equaled
pratfalls.</LD>
<TE>   But Thursday, four potential champions performed. They packed away
their nerves, they hid their insecurities, they camouflaged their fears.
They did what great athletes do. They shone brightly.</TE>
<TE>   It hadn't been this way in these championships. Big men had fallen, in
the pairs and short programs. Smaller men--lots of them--fell, in the
men's short and long programs. Even some of the ice dancing men tripped,
and they don't even have to jump, or throw or catch anything.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the women, some looking as tiny as feathers, floating airily
along the ice (that's if you're sitting up top at Staples). And they
didn't fall. They hardly stumbled. There was no plopping or flopping or
sloppiness.</TE>
<TE>   The top seven women performed their short programs nearly to
perfection, without big mistakes. The short program is the technical part
of the competition. There are eight elements that must be completed.
Various jumps, spins, twirls and footwork must be done precisely. One
slip on a double axel and it might be goodbye Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   These women didn't slip, though.</TE>
<TE>   Among the favorites, Michelle Kwan skated first, with fierce
determination and the iron caution that comes with being the chosen one,
the skater who will be considered a failure by too many people if she
doesn't win a gold medal in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago in Philadelphia, Kwan skated to the same Rachmaninoff
piano concerto that brought her seven perfect 6.0 scores at the Olympic
trials and brought many fans to tears with the beauty of the performance.</TE>
<TE>   The freedom Kwan felt in Philadelphia has been swallowed up by growing
up, by the continual fight against younger, less burdened challengers.
But she was a professional Friday, a Randy Johnson, throwing a fastball a
straight one, but heat just the same, just going out and doing the job.
The crowd rose at the end of the performance when Kwan completed her
silky spiral sequence.</TE>
<TE>   It would not be the only time the crowd stood.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Nikodinov, the quiet woman from San Pedro who has too often
been tortured by self-doubt and unwilling to believe in her special
athletic talent, exhibited uncommon grace and landed a perfect triple
lutz, launched off the correct edge of the skate, which few women do. The
spectators knew of Nikodinov's sadness, the mourning over the recent and
sudden death of her coach, Elena Tcherkasskaia, and again rose to applaud
Nikodinov's strength in her nearly flawless performance.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Hughes, the 16-year-old from New York, has fought for two years
to earn the international opinion that, with her tough triple-triple jump
combinations and great speed, she was an equal of Kwan and Russia's Irina
Slutskaya, the Olympic favorites. Her sturdy nerves brought tears to the
eyes of her coach, Robin Wagner.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to stay really cool, but it was so nice to see," Wagner
said. "It was so beautiful and she looked so gentle but so sure of
herself on the ice."</TE>
<TE>   And finally, skating in the final group, was the last of the four
women considered to be in a fight for three Olympic spots--Cohen, the
17-year-old from Laguna Niguel.</TE>
<TE>   It was as if someone took a giant breath and gave her a gentle push.
That's all it took to propel Cohen, wearing white and skating to a waltz,
lightly along the ice. Her spins and extension moves were performed with
delicate grace; her jumps landed with authority.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, who missed much of last season because of a fracture in her
back, has suffered from jittery performances in important competitions
and heard whispers about her strength and toughness.</TE>
<TE>   But as her coach, John Nicks, picked up the 4-foot-11 Cohen and swung
her around, the crowd rose again and didn't sit for several seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The final scores had Kwan first followed by Cohen, Hughes and
Nikodinov. Seven judges had Kwan first, one picked Cohen, one picked
Nikodinov.</TE>
<TE>   On this afternoon, there was no wrong choice. It is the nature of this
figure skating community to pick apart the champions. So there were some
who nitpicked about Kwan's remoteness and wished for more pure joy.
Others pointed to Hughes' flawed triple lutz, the one with the leg wrap
and the entry off the wrong edge. It's called a "flutz," and when Hughes
got some technical marks as low as 5.5, it seemed the judges might be
demanding a better lutz.</TE>
<TE>   To quote Dick Button, the voice of the sport, "Who cares?"</TE>
<TE>   Said Wagner: "I think this was probably the most exciting group of
short programs, even going back to the world championships. Everybody
really skated with their hearts, and in this particular competition, when
we're trying to get on the Olympic team, that's an extraordinary feat."</TE>

<LD>As an orthopedic doctor and mother of a 4-year-old son, Debi Thomas
doesn't have time to keep track of figure skating's daily doings.</LD>
<LD>  But Thomas, a two-time U.S. figure skating champion and 1988 Olympic
bronze medalist, knows how nervous the competitors are during this week's
championships at Staples Center. She especially empathized with five-time
national champion Michelle Kwan and the questioning Kwan has faced since
dropping longtime coach Frank Carroll.</LD>
<LD>  "She's going through a lot," Thomas said. "It's hard at this stage of
the game because everyone has an opinion and a lot to say about your
decisions. In reality, when you have to go out there and perform, you're
the only one out there. No one can do it from the sidelines. You need to
mentally pull it together ...</LD>
<TE>  "I still think Michelle Kwan is the best skater in the world. But a lot
can happen. You can slip up, you can skate a perfect performance and
still not win."</TE>
<TE>  Thomas recently completed her first orthopedic year at Martin Luther
King-Charles Drew University Medical Center. She's also a spokeswoman for
Campbell's Soup, which Thursday announced a program that will help fund
trips to the Salt Lake City Games for parents of Olympians.</TE>
<TE>  The SOUPer Parents Program will give $1,000 to the parents of athletes
in each Winter Olympic sport.</TE>
<TE>   A panel featuring Thomas, 1984 gold medal skier Phil Mahre, five-time
gold medal speedskater Eric Heiden and Carole Yamaguchi, mother of 1992
Olympic gold medal figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi, will pick the most
dedicated parents. The winner will receive $10,000.</TE>

<TE>  Beatrisa Liang of Granada Hills and Amber Corwin of Hermosa Beach were
seventh and eighth, respectively, after the women's short program.</TE>
<TE>  "I'm really happy with the way I skated," said Liang, 13. "I went all
out for everything and did the best I could."</TE>
<TE>  Corwin, 23, said she appreciated the support of friends and family so
close to home. "I was hoping to get in the top three, so I'm a little bit
disappointed," she said. "But I felt like I skated well ... I feel like I
have some goals I haven't reached that I think I still can. If I didn't
feel like I was improving and could still skate well, I wouldn't keep
doing it."</TE>
<TE>  Ye Bin Mok of Los Angeles was 15th.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  The no-flowers policy at this year's championships got an emphatic
thumbs-down from Sarah Hughes. The ban on tossing floral tributes was
instituted this year because of security concerns and because organizers
fear the staples fastening the cellophane-wrapped bouquets might fall
onto the ice and injure a skater.</TE>
<TE>  "It's sort of like missing something without it," she said.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Hughes' sister, Emily, 12, is competing in the junior women's event.
Emily Hughes, however, is last entering today's long program. Their
father, John, has been trying to follow both daughters' progress.</TE>
<TE>  "He kind of says, 'Who needs me more?"' Sarah said. "But really, I'd
probably rather he be with her. It's her first time here and everything."</TE>

<LD>UC Santa Barbara 57, Cal State Northridge 54--In a game of
comebacks, the Gauchos had the finishing kick before 1,419 at Cal State
Northridge.</LD>
<LD>  Santa Barbara also had the fast start , but the Matadors wouldn't let
an awful opening 10 minutes keep them from taking the game to the wire
despite shooting 29.1% from the field.</LD>
<LD>  It wasn't until Markus Carr's last-second three-point attempt bounced
off the rim that Santa Barbara could relax.</LD>
<TE>  The Gauchos (10-4, 4-1 in conference play) stayed among Big West
leaders by attacking the basket down the stretch while Northridge (3-10,
2-2) settled unsuccessfully for three-point shots. The Matadors made only
two of 14 three-point attempts in the second half, and Carr, who ignited
a comeback from a 19-2 deficit in the first half, missed all 10 of his
second-half shots, including six from behind the arc.</TE>
<TE>  "In the second half, we got to the basket more and that forced the
issue," said sophomore forward Branduinn Fullove, who led Santa Barbara
with 18 points and made two free throws for a 57-54 lead with 10.4
seconds left. "It opened things up for us."</TE>
<TE>  Santa Barbara trailed, 43-37, with 10 minutes left before going on a
9-0 run and taking the lead for good, 49-48, on B.J. Ward's three-point
play with 4:35 left. Consecutive layups by reserve guard Nick Jones gave
the Gauchos their biggest lead of the second half, 54-48, with 48 seconds
left before Northridge mounted one last rally, pulling within 55-54 on
Joseph Frazier's basket after a steal with 11.9 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>  But that was nothing compared to the comeback the Matadors mounted in
the first half, when they missed their first 13 shots and twice fell
behind by 17 points in the opening 10:33. Northridge rallied with an
aggressive half-court trap and Carr made three three-pointers during a
22-3 run to put the Matadors ahead, 26-24, at halftime.</TE>
<TE>  Curtis Slaughter led Northridge with 15 points.</TE>

<LD>Pepperdine (7-6) at St. Mary's (5-8), 7, KPLS (830)--With their
full complement of players in place, the Waves hope their recent
improvement will carry into tonight's West Coast Conference opener. Glen
McGowan, suspended for the fall semester, returned and scored 13 points
in Pepperdine's 82-79 overtime win over Brigham Young. Coach Paul
Westphal has largely settled on a starting lineup of Boomer Brazzle and
Jimmy Miggins at forward, Cedric Suitt at center and Devin Montgomery and
Terrance Johnson as his guards. Suitt, a 6-foot-11 senior, played the
best game of his career against BYU with eight points, 10 rebounds and
five blocked shots. First-year St. Mary's Coach Randy Bennett, a former
Pepperdine assistant under Lorenzo Romar, has already improved the Gaels.
St. Mary's won only two games last season. The Waves play another WCC
game Saturday at San Francisco.</LD>

<HD>Craven Plays More Like a Veteran</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was the rivalry in microcosm, UCLA with the reputation and USC
with something to prove. A Trojan won this battle too.</LD>
<LD>   Errick Craven showed he was the best freshman on the court, eclipsing
UCLA's touted trio of Cedric Bozeman, Dijon Thompson and Andre Patterson.</LD>
<LD>   And during the last few minutes, the guard from Torrance Bishop
Montgomery High was the best player on the court of any age, experience
or reputation.</LD>
<TE>   Craven made a three-point shot to break a 64-64 tie, then seconds
later stole a pass and drove nearly the length of the floor for a layup
for a five-point lead with 2:54 to play.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't done. After a UCLA basket, Craven drove into traffic and
made an acrobatic scoop shot to make the score 71-66.</TE>
<TE>   And finally he did it with defense, combining with Desmon Farmer to
cause Billy Knight to travel with 1:41 left.</TE>
<TE>   Craven had 13 points and five rebounds in 28 minutes, while the UCLA
freshmen were held scoreless in a combined 17 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to win," Craven said. "Those guys are great players and
deserve accolades. I wasn't trying to overshadow them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not Jason Kapono. Not Knight. UCLA had one sharpshooter on the floor
and it was forward Matt Barnes, who scored a career-high 34 points on
12-of-17 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   He made seven three-point baskets, four more than his previous career
best.</TE>
<TE>   "Any night, somebody can get hot and it was my turn," he said. "When
you lose, it's hard to feel good about it, but I'm proud I went up
against Sam Clancy, one of the best forwards in the country and scored
like that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC was tougher on the boards and rougher setting picks, but Trojan
guard Brandon Granville suffered the only injury. He was hit in the right
eye less than two minutes into the game, but not only did he remain on
the floor, he made a big play a minute later.</TE>
<TE>   Granville grabbed a long offensive rebound, spun and knocked Knight
onto his backside, then sank a three-point basket.</TE>
<TE>   He hurt the eye again with nine minutes play and sat out until Coach
Henry Bibby needed him to make free throws in the last two minutes.
Granville made five of six in the final minute and finished with 18
points.</TE>
<TE>   "I was seeing triple," he said. "But I had time on the free throws to
get my vision and made the shots."</TE>
<TE>UP NEXT FOR UCLA</TE>
<TE>   Saturday vs. Kansas (13-1), Noon, Channel 2--The No. 1 Jayhawks have
not lost since dropping their opener to Ball State at the Maui
Invitational. The next day, UCLA also lost to Ball State. Kansas boasts
perhaps the nation's best pair of forwards in Drew Gooden (20.6 points,
12.4 rebounds) and Nick Collison (15.6, 8.6).</TE>

<HD>Childress Steps Upfor Stanford</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Casey Jacobsen was on his way toward another horrible game, and
Stanford was staring at a possible second consecutive road loss.</LD>
<LD>  In came freshman Josh Childress to cover Jacobsen's back and help the
Cardinal pull away for a victory.</LD>
<LD>  Childress scored 19 points, including seven in a row during a
second-half run, and Jacobsen recovered his shot after that to lift the
14th-ranked Cardinal past Oregon State, 67-50, Thursday night.</LD>
<TE>  "We need him every night," said Jacobsen, who scored 12 of his 15
points in the second half. "We don't need him just once every while."</TE>
<TE>  Childress came off the bench in the first half to spell Jacobsen, who
picked up his third foul with 12:52 left. Childress endured his own
jittery start, missing six of his first seven shots, but he shot seven of
eight after that.</TE>
<TE>  "He missed a couple shots and looked nervous," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "Once he found out he was going to stay in ... he found
a way to get more aggressive and made some plays."</TE>
<TE>  Chris Borchardt had 17 points and 18 rebounds for Stanford (9-3, 2-1),
which trailed by four with 14:18 left before going on a 23-5 run.
Childress and Jacobsen each scored nine points during the spurt.</TE>
<TE>  Philip Ricci scored 14 points and Brian Jackson had 12 to lead the
Beavers (8-7, 1-4), who have lost nine of 10 to Stanford.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  No. 20 Arizona 92, Washington State 85--Jason Gardner scored 23 points
and the Wildcats (10-4, 3-2) held off the Cougars (4-9, 0-5) at Pullman,
Wash.</TE>
<TE>  Arizona has won 33 consecutive against Washington State, dating to
1986. Washington State lost its seventh in a row, despite a career-high
27 points from J Locklier. He also had 11 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>  Arizona's Luke Walton, back after missing three games, scored 15 points
and had 11 assists. The Wildcats shot 55.7% from the floor.</TE>
<TE>  Oregon 76, California 72--Frederick Jones scored 22 points and Anthony
Lever had 12 as the Ducks (11-4, 4-1) came from behind to defeat the
Golden Bears (10-3, 1-2) at Eugene, Ore.</TE>
<TE>  Chris Christoffersen and Luke Ridnour had 11 each for Oregon and Luke
Jackson scored 10 for the Ducks, who are 9-0 at home.</TE>
<TE>  California was led by Joe Shipp, who scored 24 points.</TE>
<TE>  Washington 81, Arizona State 68--Doug Wrenn scored 23 points as the
Huskies (7-8, 1-4) ended a losing streak at six games with a victory over
the Sun Devils (9-5, 2-3) at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>  Wrenn missed his first shot, but ended up making nine of 14.</TE>
<TE>  Arizona State saw its winning streak end at four. Chad Prewitt led the
Sun Devils with 24 points.</TE>

<HD>Elite Will Meet Again in Santa Barbara</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Barbara Tournament of Champions began as a good excuse
for Mark Walsh to sleep in his own bed. Tired of accompanying his girls'
team at Santa Barbara High south to compete against a greater number of
elite teams, Walsh decided to play host to a two-day tournament.</LD>
<LD>  Two years ago, it featured an eight-team field, and last year, after
some selling, Walsh had it up to 16.</LD>
<LD>   This season, he had to turn away some teams that hoped to return for
today's opening rounds at UC Santa Barbara.</LD>
<TE>   "That's been the hardest part because I've upset some people who
wanted to come back," said Walsh, who dropped El Cajon Valhalla,
Huntington Beach Marina and Lompoc Cabrillo this season in favor of San
Diego University, Carlsbad and Ventura, teams he felt were playing at a
higher level.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Santa Barbara, the other teams entered are Santa Ana
Foothill, Santa Margarita, Lake Forest El Toro, Newport Harbor, Corona
del Mar, Long Beach Wilson, Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley, Irvine,
Agoura, Coronado, Riverside North and Riverside Arlington. That field
includes seven teams ranked in The Times' top 10 and four of the top
five.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm also really excited about the San Diego teams that are coming,"
Walsh said. "And it's nice to get a team from the area like Ventura."</TE>
<TE>  Santa Barbara defeated Foothill to win the inaugural tournament, but
the Knights came back and beat Capistrano Valley for the title last
season. Top-seeded Foothill is expected to return to Saturday's
championship game, where it could face a showdown with second-seeded
Santa Margarita.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Making it official: Some coaches have voiced concern over the quality
of officiating at the Santa Barbara tournament. Walsh agrees he has a
smaller pool of officials to draw from, but doesn't expect a problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see a weak official on the schedule," he said. "I know in the
past it has been an issue, but referees have always been an issue
everywhere. I go down to Orange County and get upset just as much as they
get upset up here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>  More officiating: Thousand Oaks Coach Jacinta Jarrell was still
scratching her head a day after losing a Marmonte League opener Tuesday
to Simi Valley Royal.</TE>
<TE>  The Highlanders were awarded three penalty throws and converted each in
a 5-4 victory. Both teams, along with Agoura, are expected to challenge
for the league title.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just pulling my hair out at the calls," Jarrell said. "I wish
they would let the girls play on their merits. Our girls outswam them and
were quicker up the pool. It was a very disappointing loss."</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Streak-buster: Riverside North's one-point victory Wednesday over
Arlington not only put the Huskies in great position to win their first
Ivy League title, but also ended a nine-game losing streak against
Arlington.</TE>
<TE>   North lost to the Lions three times during summer league play last
year, three times last season and three times during the summer of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a huge victory for us," North Coach Tom Finwall said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A review of game tapes determined that El Segundo defeated South
Torrance, 48-47, Wednesday in an Ocean League boys' basketball game that
ended in controversy.</LD>
<LD>  El Segundo Athletic Director Steve Shevlin said both schools scored the
game from videotapes because the scoreboard showed a 48-47 El Segundo
victory while scorebooks from both schools had South Torrance winning,
47-46.</LD>
<LD>  Both coaches agreed to file a protest with the Ocean League because
referees refused to sign the scorebooks. Thursday they withdrew their
protests after videotapes revealed that both scorekeepers failed to
record a basket during the frenzied finish to the game.</LD>
<TE>  "We could have gone ahead with the protest because what's in the book
is official," South Torrance Coach Lamont Henry said. "But they beat us,
so we decided not to."</TE>
<TE>  El Segundo's DaShawn Strong made the game-winning shot with three
seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>  Referees are prohibited from reviewing videotapes to aid in making game
decisions.</TE>
<TE>  "I spoke with [officials from] South Torrance and everything is hunky
dory now," Shevlin said. "It was pretty crazy at the end and we all have
high school kids doing the books and they just missed a basket."</TE>
<TE>  El Segundo is 15-2 and 4-0 in Ocean League play. South Torrance falls
to 5-10, 0-4.</TE>

<LD>Torrance Bishop Montgomery forced 25 turnovers, and scored 28

Puente Bishop Amat in a Del Rey League girls' basketball game.</LD>
<LD>  The greatest beneficiary of the turnovers was Noelle Quinn, who scored
a game-high 30 points for Bishop Montgomery (13-3, 3-0 in league), The
Times' eighth-ranked team.</LD>
<LD>  Bishop Amat (14-5, 0-1), ranked No. 22, was missing three regulars from
its lineup because of injuries.</LD>
<TE>  The Lancers battled back from a 21-11 second-quarter deficit to take a

<TE>   But Quinn scored six points in a 9-0 run during the third quarter,
giving Bishop Montgomery a 42-36 lead.</TE>
<TE>  Quinn also had seven steals and seven assists.</TE>

<LD>Josh Zazulia, Donald Brady and Chase McQuillen have been nearly
inseparable since third grade. They've gone to the same schools, played
on the same basketball teams and hung out in the same neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   They are senior starters on Palm Desert High's basketball team. Each
scored more than 1,300 on the SAT and has a grade-point average of 3.9 or
higher.</LD>
<LD>   Their dream is to star in a West Coast version of the 1986 movie
"Hoosiers," about a basketball team from a small Indiana town that wins
the state championship.</LD>
<TE>   "Josh has watched that movie before every basketball season since
fourth grade," Chase said. "I absolutely hated it because it was slow and
lame. But I grew to like it. It is kind of a comparison to us."</TE>
<TE>   Palm Desert (14-4) is one of those rare basketball teams in Southern
California comprised mostly of players who grew up down the street from
one another. Their parents are contractors, teachers, nurses,
construction workers, businessmen and homemakers. Seven of the 12 players
have known each other since elementary school.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a neighborhood feel to this team," said Coach Don Brady,
Donald's father. "The central theme has been work hard on your grades and
basketball will come. We've been blessed with kids not very athletic but
they have basketball fundamentals."</TE>
<TE>   Added Donald: "These are the players who live in the area. We're doing
it how high school basketball is supposed to be played--the high school
you watched as a kid growing up you're playing for and not driving 11/2
hours to play on a team."</TE>
<TE>   It's inspiring to see how much fun the Palm Desert players have.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all kind of like brothers," Donald said. "If you watch us play,
we're always smiling. It's enjoyable. Everyone on our team likes everyone
else."</TE>
<TE>   They're a reminder of a different era, when families moved into an
area and sent their children to neighborhood schools, from kindergarten
through high school, and coaches didn't have to worry about players
coming or leaving on the basis of a team's success.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great experience, it really is," Chase said. "We're all
friends on the court. Nobody is really an individual. We know each
other's strengths. If we need something done, we know the right person to
go to."</TE>
<TE>   Chase, Josh and Donald are so close they know each other's most
embarrassing moments and best-kept secrets.</TE>
<TE>   There was the time in eighth grade when Donald streaked across a golf
course during Josh's birthday party.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't remember that," Donald said.</TE>
<TE>   There was the time Donald brought over his dog in fifth grade to meet
Chase's dog.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought they'd get along perfectly," Chase said. "His dog bit my
dog's ear and made him bleed. I was ashamed. I was hoping my dog would
win."</TE>
<TE>   There was the time Josh ran against Donald for president of the fifth
grade at Gerald R. Ford Elementary School. Donald promised to plant new
trees to make the campus look better. Josh promised free pizza at lunch
time. Josh won in a landslide.</TE>
<TE>   But Josh is still tormented about the time in kindergarten when four
classmates were chosen to be Ninja Turtles and he had to be Splinter, the
wise man.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to wish they were sick and didn't come to school so I could be
a Ninja Turtle," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd think he'd be over it 12 years later," said Donald, who was one
of the Ninja Turtles.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was the time Chase and Josh got into a fight on the
basketball court during practice a couple of years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I did something to get Josh mad and he retaliated," Chase
said. "I went crazy on him. It's not like I beat him up. He slapped me
and we rolled around on the ground wrestling."</TE>
<TE>   Said Donald: "They fought for five minutes and laughed for five
minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Josh is 6 feet 3 and has become Palm Desert's all-time scoring leader.
He averages 15.7 points. Donald is 6-1, averages 15.5 points and has 52
three-pointers. Chase, 6-1, is in his first year as a starter, averaging
12.9 points. Since third grade, their coach has been Donald's father.</TE>
<TE>   "We've learned everything exactly the same under the same coaching for
so long," Donald said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Josh: "We trust ourselves on the court. We know what each of us
likes to do. It's kind of like I don't need to look when I have to pass.
I know they're going to be there and make the shot."</TE>
<TE>   Don Brady started Palm Desert's basketball program 16 years ago. He
entered this season with a record of 170-170. These days, with
expectations of winning championship after championship, that's the kind
of record that can lead to the firing of a high school coach. But Brady
goes with the players who show up and offers them more than just an
education in basketball.</TE>
<TE>   For 12 years, his players have volunteered to speak to junior high and
elementary students about making wise decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good for my kids as well as the kids they speak to because it
recommits them to the choices they make," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For Josh, Donald and Chase, there are no regrets about their choices
to excel in school, play basketball and, most of all, embrace friendships
that could last a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, they'll be going their separate ways for college. Josh wants to
become a businessman, Chase an engineer and Donald a teacher.</TE>
<TE>   "In a couple of months, [basketball is] going to be over and in five
or six months, high school will be over," Josh said. "You need to enjoy
the time while it's still here."</TE>
<TE>   Since third grade, they've dreamed of trying to win a Southern Section
championship in their senior year. They're in Division III-AA and have a
chance to send a powerful message.</TE>
<TE>   "We're showing teams you don't have to transfer somewhere to have
success on a basketball team," Donald said. "We've all stayed together
and success is coming from a team that stuck together."</TE>

<LD>One of Southern California's more popular claiming horses will make
his first start of the year in today's sixth race at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>  Copelan's Eagle, who turned 12 on New Year's Day, will run his 68th
race in the six-furlong dash for $10,000 claimers, shooting for his 15th
victory.</LD>
<LD>  Owned by a partnership that includes Lemalu Stable and trained by A.C.
Avila, the gelded son of Copelan, who was bred in California by Farrell
Jones and began his career racing for Richard Mandella, is the 3-1 second
choice in a field of 10. Twelve were entered, but Sarigor and Town
Gambler were scratched Thursday.</LD>
<TE>  Winless in 13 starts in 2000, Copelan's Eagle found his second wind
last year. The bay won three times and was second six times in 13 races.
In his final five races as an 11-year-old, he won twice and was second
three times, losing by a neck to Big Team Spirit when last seen in
Arcadia on Nov. 4.</TE>
<TE>  Omar Berrio, his longtime jockey, will be aboard today. In 36 starts at
the Arcadia track, Copelan's Eagle has won nine times and finished in the
top three 23 times.</TE>
<TE>  The 5-2 favorite is J. Cash, a 5-year-old gelded son of Present Value
who is taking a steep drop in class for trainer Bob Hess Jr. Claimed for
$32,000 July 27 at Del Mar, he won his first race for his new outfit, but
has been well beaten in two subsequent starts. He hasn't run since Nov.
23.</TE>
<TE>  *</TE>
<TE>  Race of the day: Seven competitive sprinters will run in the third at
six furlongs. Misanello, who was overmatched in the El Conejo, is the 5-2
favorite as he goes for his third win in five starts since being claimed
by Barry Abrams.</TE>
<TE>  Who's hot: Is It True Mex? A winner of three of 24 on the main track,
the 6-year-old gelding has found a home on the turf. He is five for five
on grass and will shoot for a sixth consecutive win in today's opener at
41/2 furlongs at Golden Gate Fields.</TE>
<TE>  Who's not: Lodi Renegade. Beaten by 26 lengths running against $8,000
maiden fillies in her last start, the daughter of Banquet Table steps up
to the $25,000 level looking for her 12th loss in today's fourth at
Golden Gate.</TE>
<TE>  Exotically speaking:  A pick four using Follow My Heineken and Lunar
Surprise in the fifth, Copelan's Eagle and Jim's Relaunch in the sixth,
Eye Pea Oh and Pacing The Cage in the seventh and Campaign Andover,
Shesmyhucklebery and Gamblin Town in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>  Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/34. Money: Previous day/meet total:
$34/$234.60. Total money bet: $206.</TE>

<HD>Auditor Says It Destroyed Enron Records</HD>
<DH>Finance: The admission angers investigators of the energy firm's
messy bankruptcy. Its chief sought help from two Cabinet members, the
White House reveals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The accounting firm Andersen acknowledged Thursday that it
destroyed a "significant" number of documents related to its audit of
Enron Corp., as the White House disclosed that Enron's chief executive
contacted Bush Cabinet members for help when the energy company was
collapsing.</LD>
<LD>   Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans
said they listened to Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay's description of the
firm's dire financial problems last fall but took no action.</LD>
<LD>   Both revelations deepened the controversy over Enron's sudden
failure--one that has financial, legal and political overtones. The
disclosure by Andersen, until recently known as Arthur Andersen, prompted
outrage in Congress and could complicate federal investigations into the
massive bankruptcy.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen said in a statement that it had disposed of a "significant
but undetermined number of electronic and paper documents and
correspondence" relating to Enron. Investigators could not immediately
say what documents were destroyed. A company spokesman said the matter is
under review and would not say whether the destruction was accidental or
intentional. The company said millions of documents related to Enron
still exist.</TE>
<TE>   A congressional aide said Andersen notified investigators that
"potentially thousands of records" were destroyed in September, October
and November. Investigators plan to meet with the head of Andersen's
Houston office next week and question him on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the administration's efforts to distance itself from the Enron
fiasco, the company's huge political footprint continued to create
problems. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, his chief of staff and the entire
U.S. attorney's office in Houston, where Enron is based, recused
themselves from the criminal probe of the company because of potential
conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft received campaign contributions from Enron for his failed
2000 Senate campaign, and the U.S. attorney in Houston said many on his
staff have family members who could be affected by the Enron bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   The fallout touched the White House, as President Bush ordered senior
officials to recommend reforms of the pension system and to examine
federal rules governing corporate disclosures. Investigators are probing
whether company officials withheld financial information from investors
who, along with employees in the company pension plan, suffered huge
losses in the firm's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "Ken Lay is a supporter," the president said of the Enron executive, a
generous donor to Bush's political campaigns. "But what anybody's going
to find is that this administration will fully investigate issues, such
as the Enron bankruptcy, to make sure we can learn from the past and make
sure that workers are protected."</TE>
<TE>   The latest twist in the Enron saga came one day after the Justice
Department launched a criminal probe of the company, investigating, among
other matters, whether Enron knew of problems but failed to disclose
them. In congressional testimony last month, the head of Andersen said he
had warned Enron that the company might be guilty of "possible illegal
acts" for withholding financial information from auditors--an allegation
Enron denied.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's destruction of records drew angry reactions from members of
Congress investigating the accounting methods used by the auditor.</TE>
<TE>   Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee called the loss "deeply troubling" and vowed to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   "It should never have happened," Tauzin said. "Clearly this is a very
serious matter. Anyone who destroyed records simply out of stupidity
should be fired; anyone who destroyed records intentionally to subvert
our investigation should be prosecuted."</TE>
<TE>   "The list of problems and problem people involved in this entire
tawdry affair seems destined to grow," said Rep. John D. Dingell of
Michigan, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
"The seriousness of this matter cries out for further investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Cutler, director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's
enforcement division, called the record destruction an "extremely serious
matter" but added that it "will not deter us from pursuit of our
investigation and will be included within the scope of our
investigation."</TE>
<TE>   The SEC is investigating whether Enron used loopholes in accounting
regulations to hide debt. In addition, Congress is looking into
Andersen's interpretation of accounting rules that allowed Enron to
exclude losses at several partnerships from its reporting. Enron and
Andersen dispute who is to blame for the faulty accounting.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 16, Enron reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million and
disclosed a $1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity. On Nov. 8, it
announced it had overstated its earnings by $586 million during the last
four years, sending the company's stock tumbling from more than $90 a
share a year earlier to less than a dollar. The meltdown cost more than
4,000 employees their jobs and destroyed the retirement savings of
employees with company-sponsored savings plans.</TE>
<TE>   Because, as the company said, the retirement plan was changing
administrators, those employees were locked out of selling their shares
at the time the stock began its most precipitous descent. However, many
executives managed to sell their shares just before the stock's plunge.</TE>
<TE>   The company filed for protection from its creditors Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Lay called
O'Neill and Evans separately, reporting "his concerns about whether or
not Enron would be able to meet its obligations."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill said in the two calls he received--on Oct. 28 and Nov. 8,
according to an aide--Lay expressed concern about the implications for
the capital markets and also that a possible downgrading of the company's
credit rating might ruin a pending merger prospect.</TE>
<TE>   Lay did not ask for anything specific, O'Neill said. "As secretary of
the Treasury with responsibility for the U.S. capital markets, I get
calls every day from the big players in the world" warning about
important financial events, he told CNN.</TE>
<TE>   But Treasury spokeswoman Michele Davis said Lay did draw a comparison
with Long Term Capital Management, a large investment firm that was saved
from collapse in 1998 by a federally orchestrated private bailout.</TE>
<TE>   Lay "expressed a concern that if Enron went bankrupt, it would affect
the credit markets the way the Long Term Capital Management problems a
few years earlier affected the credit markets, that it would have ripple
effects throughout the whole banking sector," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said O'Neill never discussed a bailout or any other kind of aid
for Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Evans said Lay was hoping for high-level "support."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said that the secretaries decided not to inform Bush of the
calls and that Bush did not learn of them until Thursday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said Evans and O'Neill handled the matter appropriately.
Communication "is not a wrongdoing. What took place here was they
received phone calls and took no action."</TE>
<TE>   However, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) said the calls show that
the administration had advance word of Enron's collapse and did nothing
to protect shareholders or employees.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer dismissed the criticism as partisan rhetoric, "what people
have become so used to in Washington, which is a politically charged,
politically motivated effort to blame one party or to look only at one
party." Enron, he said, has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to
both parties.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said he had not spoken with Lay about his company's financial
problems and had not seen him since last spring, when they met at a
Houston theater where the president's mother was the sponsor of a
book-reading fund-raiser by celebrity authors.</TE>
<TE>   Lay was a so-called pioneer in Bush's presidential campaign, which
meant he committed to raising at least $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Lay also personally contributed more than $275,000 to the Republican
National Committee during the 2000 election cycle, part of overall
donations from company employees and directors to the RNC that exceeded
$1.1 million. Enron gave $100,000 to help pay for Bush's inauguration. In
that cycle, Enron employees and directors gave $530,000 to the Democratic
National Committee; Lay made no personal contributions to the DNC.</TE>
<TE>   In calling for an examination of the pension rules, Bush said he
directed O'Neill, Evans and Labor Secretary Elaine Chao to determine "the
effects of the current law on hard-working Americans and to come up with
recommendations of how to reform the system to make sure that people are
not exposed to losing their life savings as the result of a bankruptcy,
for example."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he said that O'Neill, along with the SEC, the Federal
Reserve and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission would study
corporate disclosure rules and regulations in light of the Enron
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "There needs to be a full review of disclosure rules to make sure that
the American stockholder, or any stockholder, is protected," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron grew from a small natural-gas pipeline operator into the world's
largest energy-trading operation. At its peak, it handled 1 in 4
wholesale deals for electricity, gas and other energy products.</TE>
<TE>   The company championed energy deregulation and tried to influence the
way California structured its energy markets and how the state steered
through its electricity crisis. It became a target of attacks from
politicians, regulators and consumer activists for its aggressive
business tactics.</TE>

<HD>Carvings Spark Debate on Origin of Abstract Thought</HD>
<DH>Science: The discovery suggests the ability began longer ago than
believed, and in Africa, not Europe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES SCIENCE WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The very modern human traits of complex and abstract thinking may
have evolved in Africa 77,000 years ago--almost twice as early as
previously believed--according to a team of anthropologists who unearthed
intricate geometric carvings on bits of rock from a South African cave.</LD>
<LD>   The finding, if verified, could overturn much current thinking in
anthropology. But the sweeping claim is already generating controversy
among experts in the field.</LD>
<LD>   The discovery suggests that modern human behavior evolved in Africa
rather than Europe. The artifacts, pieces of red rock etched with
geometric shapes, are more than 40,000 years older than another milepost
of complex behavior: the dazzling paintings of animals and humans on the
walls of French caves.</LD>
<TE>   "In light of this new evidence it seems that, at least in southern
Africa, Homo sapiens was behaviorally modern about 77,000 years ago,"
wrote Christopher S. Henshilwood, the anthropologist who led the
research. His findings are being published online today in the journal
Science. The etchings, he said, "may have been constructed with symbolic
intent."</TE>
<TE>   Anthropologists consider the production of art, particularly the use
of symbols, a hallmark of modern human behavior. Others include the
development of specialized tools, including flaked spear points and
fishing nets, and the use of decoration.</TE>
<TE>   Modern humans evolved in Africa about 100,000 years ago. About 50,000
years ago, they spread into Europe and began to displace the
Neanderthals--a separate humanlike species.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all ancient traces of modern behavior, carved bone tools and
cave paintings have been discovered in Europe. That fact has led
paleoanthropologists such as Stanford's Richard Klein to suggest that
some kind of behavioral revolution occurred 50,000 years ago that fueled
improved abilities to hunt and gather, a population boom, worldwide
migration and some artistic abilities.</TE>
<TE>   Klein suggests that the behavior changes were due to a biological
advance, perhaps a change in brain structure. Others say the primary
change more likely was cultural. Still others argue that no abrupt change
occurred, but that art and culture developed slowly.</TE>
<TE>   Early humans living in Africa, many surmised, led a more primitive way
of life--one that did not include symbolic artworks.</TE>
<TE>   The newly discovered objects could challenge all of those assumptions.
The find consists of seven carved pieces of ochre, a red stone used to
make pigment powders. Ochre powder is often mixed with animal fat to
create body paint for ceremonial and ritualistic use. Two of the ochre
pieces carry what look to be abstract carvings: parallel lines in a
crosshatched design.</TE>
<TE>   Henshilwood said the patterns appear to be carefully and deliberately
carved onto rocks that were rubbed smooth beforehand. He believes the
patterns are abstract symbols that were probably created by one artist
but understood by others--an ability that would likely require the use of
language.</TE>
<TE>   But some skeptics say that because the newly discovered etchings are
not found throughout Africa, they may have been a fluke or the work of a
single genius who left no cultural legacy.</TE>
<TE>   Anthropologist Meg Conkey of UC Berkeley, who has studied the world's
oldest known paintings on the walls of France's Grotte Chauvet, says the
more interesting question is why the carvings were found in this cave and
not others.</TE>
<TE>   Henshilwood said the coastal dwellers who occupied the cave could have
advanced more quickly because of a rich seafood diet. There is evidence
to suggest that early coastal civilizations often thrived, said
Henshilwood, an affiliate anthropologist at the Iziko South African
Museum in Cape Town and an adjunct researcher at the State University of
New York at Stony Brook.</TE>
<TE>   He also predicts that more early art will be found in other African
caves when they are excavated as thoroughly as those in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   But Klein, who has worked in several caves in Africa, including the
Blombos cave where the new carvings were discovered, counters that there
are excellent recent excavations throughout the continent. If
civilization was advanced so early, he asks, "Why are these [carvings] so
rare?"</TE>
<TE>   Anthropologists, much like modern art critics, are also vigorously
debating the importance of the etchings. "Is it art, or somebody with a
stone tool just sitting there scratching?" asked Klein, who said the
patterns are "interesting" but not as compelling as the depictions of
animals and humans created on cave walls 30,000 to 33,000 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Added Steve Kuhn, an anthropologist at the University of Arizona: "It
could be just doodlings."</TE>
<TE>   Henshilwood discovered the Blombos site in 1991, in a 120-foot cliff
overlooking the Indian Ocean 180 miles east of Cape Town.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Henshilwood's team published the discovery of
specialized, decorative flaked stone and bone tools in the cave. Found in
70,000-year-old sand deposits, the tools suggested unexpected
advancements in civilization.</TE>
<TE>   The carvings were found in sediments conclusively dated to 77,000
years. The rocks themselves were not dated.</TE>
<TE>   The carvings are far older than the oldest previously recorded
artistic artifacts in Africa--ostrich eggshell beads thought to be 40,000
to 50,000 years old and discovered by anthropologist Stanley Ambrose of
the University of Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   A few carvings and ornaments older than 50,000 years have been
discovered elsewhere. One, which seems to be the etched form of a woman
with an elaborate hairdo, is 250,000 years old. But anthropologists
consider those to be rare, crude and lacking in any kind of systematic
symbolic representation.</TE>

<HD>Davis Unveils Budget Plan Based on Cuts, Optimism</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis proposed a $100-billion state budget Thursday that
would borrow billions of dollars against the future and cut services to
the state's poor in order to close a projected $12-billion shortfall
without raising taxes.</LD>
<LD>   The plan also depends on the economy rebounding by midyear, pushing up
tax receipts. Some key assumptions, including predictions of revenue from
stock options and capital gains, are billions of dollars higher than
estimates from the state's legislative analyst.</LD>
<LD>   The budget, which will be modified between now and May and must be
approved by the Legislature, outlined a combination of cuts, accounting
changes and spending deferrals to get the state through the next 18
months. Education, which Davis says is his highest priority, was largely
spared in the budget-cutting exercises, as was public safety.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, Davis has proposed dashing a state-funded cost-of-living
increase for welfare recipients. The CalWORKS welfare-to-work program is
set to take $566 million in cuts under the governor's plan.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for the poor are also worried that a Davis proposal to
revamp child-care services to aid more families could put some former
welfare recipients back on the public dole.</TE>
<TE>   The governor portrayed his budget as a "responsible" and "balanced"
document that maintains vital services.</TE>
<TE>   "Preparing this budget has been a very painful exercise," said Davis,
who is serving the final year of his first term and is seeking
reelection. "Difficult decisions were required, and I made difficult
decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some of the obstacles that he confronts were evident in
Thursday's reactions from leaders of both parties. State Senate
Republican minority leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga accused the
Democratic governor of deficit spending, while Senate President Pro Tem
John Burton (D-San Francisco) called the plan "immoral" for its treatment
of the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Although it does not raise taxes, the governor's budget proposal for
fiscal 2002-03, which begins July 1, does impose $143 million in new fees
and surcharges on a host of less-than-sympathetic characters, including
polluters, drunk drivers and other criminals.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis budget also creates a $1 co-payment on prescription drugs
under Medi-Cal, which would bring in $30.6 million. A proposal to
increase a fee aimed primarily at public and teaching hospitals that
serve a disproportionate number of poor patients would raise a little
more than $55 million.</TE>
<TE>   Burton, a liberal who is Davis' most outspoken Democratic critic in
the Legislature, denounced the governor's proposal. He said the plan to
eliminate the state's contribution to cost-of-living increases for the
blind, elderly and disabled and CalWORKS welfare participants is an
"immoral act that I'm not going to participate in. We're going to restore
cost-of-living increases to those people.</TE>
<TE>   "A cost-of-living increase for some people can be the difference
between tuna fish and cat food for their lunches," Burton told reporters,
adding, "I would challenge the governor to live on $400 a month."</TE>
<TE>Counting on $1 Billion From Washington</TE>
<TE>   To close a gap estimated at $12 billion or more, Davis has proposed
$5.2 billion in cuts. He also wants to put off some expenses and borrow
against the future, a strategy that he acknowledges will reduce the
amount of money available later. In addition, he is counting on about $1
billion from the federal government, which he has yet to secure, to help
cover rising medical and security costs, among other expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Proposals to defer state contributions to the California Public
Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers'
Retirement System would free up close to $880 million. But the money must
be repaid with interest, and the state must also agree to other financial
enhancements for fund members.</TE>
<TE>   A plan to borrow against the state's tobacco settlement money would
raise more than $2 billion, but would require the state to make interest
payments and would reduce the amount available from the settlement in
future years. The plan would allow the state to immediately receive 40%
of settlement money that is scheduled to come in over 23 years.</TE>
<TE>   Brulte accused Davis of engaging in "deficit financing," which is
prohibited in California.</TE>
<TE>   "When you borrow from the Public Employees Retirement System and pay
it off over 30 years, when you borrow from the tobacco settlement fund
and pay it off over 22 years, when you borrow to pay for current-year
expenditures, that is deficit financing," Brulte said.</TE>
<TE>   "A child who is born today, who enters the work force 20 years from
now, will still be paying off Gov. Davis' 2002-03 budget," Brulte said.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Ross of the California Budget Project, a group that advocates for
the poor during the budget process, said Davis' plan fails to address the
larger long-term problem facing the state's finances, which has been
cited by Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill: The current level of
services exceeds the amount of money the state is taking in.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to see some higher taxes, because there is an imbalance
between the revenue base and the services the government provides," Ross
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis budget proposes to add 100,000 children to the state's child
care programs, but with only a slight increase in spending.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Fuller, a professor of education and public policy at UC
Berkeley, commended the governor for maintaining existing spending levels
on child care, but questioned his proposal to expand the number of
children who would benefit, saying it would cheapen the quality of care.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like they are just trying to stretch the existing budget to
100,000 new kids," Fuller said.</TE>
<TE>   "I see it as the McDonaldization of child care: The patties get
thinner and thinner, but it's the same amount of beef."</TE>
<TE>   He took issue with a proposal to roll back the maximum age of an
after-school child care program from 13 to 12.</TE>
<TE>   The spending plan, which includes a $500-million reserve, presented
new challenges for Davis, who enjoyed surpluses topping $10 billion
during his first two years in office.</TE>
<TE>   The surpluses coincided with the rise of the Silicon Valley tech set,
whose earnings poured billions of dollars into state coffers. The dot-com
bust, coupled with a softening stock market, meant many tax revenues
slowed dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   One indication that Davis is counting on an economic rebound is the
amount of money he is expecting from taxes on capital gains and stock
options. His budget counts on $3 billion more from those sources than
forecast by the legislative analyst.</TE>
<TE>   And though Davis did not propose raising taxes, his budget relies on
revenue from a quarter-cent increase in the sales tax that kicked in this
month and is expected to raise about $1.2 billion in 2002.</TE>
<TE>Deficit Spending Accusation Denied</TE>
<TE>   State Finance Director Timothy Gage denied that the governor's budget
proposal would cause the state to engage in deficit spending. He also
said borrowing against tobacco settlement money makes sense when the
alternative is making even deeper cuts and an economic rebound is on the
horizon.</TE>
<TE>   Spending on education continues to be a priority. The budget proposal
earmarks $53.9 billion for kindergarten through 12th grade, $200 million
more than approved this year, not counting $1.2 billion in education cuts
Davis proposed in November. Per-student spending is set to rise to $7,058
from $7,002, with the same caveat.</TE>
<TE>   One of Davis' most ambitious plans is to increase funding for before-
and after-school programs by $75 million in 2002-03--a move that would
pave the way for 79,000 more children to participate.</TE>
<TE>   California's universities and community colleges also escaped overall
funding reductions.</TE>
<TE>   And Davis appears to largely spare local governments, which suffered
during the deficits of the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Chief Administrative Officer David Janssen said his
staff was still analyzing the budget to see how much it would cost the
county, but said, "We think this is a good start."</TE>
<TE>   AIDS activists praised Davis for allotting more money for a drug
assistance program and maintaining funding for related programs.</TE>
<TE>   Beth Capell, spokeswoman for Health Access California, lauded Davis'
budget plan for minimizing damage to health care. He has not proposed
shrinking the number of people eligible for Medi-Cal or reducing their
level of benefits, as other strapped states have. Capell said her group
would lobby against proposed cuts to county hospitals, delays on parent
coverage and requirements for Medi-Cal co-payments.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also agreed Thursday to provide hospitals with hundreds of
millions of dollars promised to them as part of a 1999 legal settlement
with the state.</TE>
<TE>   "The mere fact that no one is rescinding those agreements in light of
a $12-billion budget deficit, we feel is a very positive step," said Jan
Emerson, spokeswoman for the California Healthcare Assn.</TE>

<HD>Shake-Ups Launched at 4 Schools</HD>
<DH>Education: The L.A. district begins removing principals and some
teachers after state audits call the campuses deplorable. Other sites may
be targeted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<AU>RICHARD LEE COLVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES EDUCATION WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District has begun removing
principals and teachers at four schools, kicking off a radical campaign
to reinvigorate its most troubled campuses.</LD>
<LD>   The actions result from scathing state audits that cited the schools'
low expectations for students, weak leadership, poor teaching and rundown
buildings. They are the first among many possible staffing changes at
faltering campuses across the district, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The campaign comes as the nation gears up for a possible wave of
school shake-ups under demanding federal accountability measures signed
into law by President Bush this week. The approach by L.A. Unified, the
country's second largest school district, may offer a preview of what
accountability means in extreme cases.</LD>
<TE>   Among the changes in Los Angeles, which will be finalized next week:</TE>
<TE>   * All five administrators and three top teachers will be reassigned
from Sun Valley Middle School in the San Fernando Valley within the next
three months. The principal already has left and voluntarily agreed to a
demotion.</TE>
<TE>   * Three veteran principals--at Roosevelt High in Boyle Heights, Wilson
High in El Sereno and Locke High in South Los Angeles--have been asked to
leave or are stepping down under pressure. Even the secretaries and
office workers at Locke could be moved to new jobs.</TE>
<TE>   * At Sun Valley, Mount Vernon Middle School in the Crenshaw district
and a few other schools, all employees will have to agree in writing to
abide by dozens of corrective measures to keep their jobs at those
campuses.</TE>
<TE>   The reforms mark a shift for L.A. Unified, which has been reluctant to
make drastic staff changes likely to draw the ire of administrators' and
teachers' unions. But union officials, privately acknowledging the
severity of the problems at some campuses, have not yet objected to the
current changes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is serious reform," L.A. Unified Supt. Roy Romer said. "These
schools had deteriorated to a point where they had very low expectations.
People weren't functioning well. Sometimes you need to change the culture
of a place."</TE>
<TE>   Though unusual for L.A. Unified, the approach is not unprecedented.
Within the last two years, other large California school districts,
including those in San Diego and Oakland, have moved or demoted large
numbers of school leaders. Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and many
districts in Texas also have penalized principals for low test scores.</TE>
<TE>   In coming years, the leaders of hundreds, if not thousands, of failing
schools across the country could face similar fates under new federal
rules requiring all campuses to raise test scores for all students.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified and California, however, are somewhat ahead of
federal mandates for accountability.</TE>
<TE>   State auditors last fall targeted 10 low-performing schools in the
district. In their reports, obtained by The Times, they portrayed the
campuses as paralyzed by low morale and overwhelmed by the needs of their
students.</TE>
<TE>   Auditors at Sun Valley, for example, found that management was poor,
instruction was uneven and the campus was "unsanitary, unsafe and
hazardous."</TE>
<TE>   Graffiti mars classroom doors and garbage litters the school
grounds."This school is a dump," seventh-grader Vanessa Duran said
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers interviewed this week described former Principal Manuel
Rangell as an ineffective leader who showed little initiative or vision,
and did a poor job of building morale.</TE>
<TE>   They said Rangell and the school's teachers union representative
regularly feuded.</TE>
<TE>   "The atmosphere of the school was hurting," said one teacher. "We did
want a change."</TE>
<TE>   Rangell did not return phone calls Thursday. But the union
representative, Sharon Noland, who also has been reassigned, said she
plans to fight it.</TE>
<TE>   "I have devoted 37 years of my life to this district," said Noland.
"Overnight, they're going to demote me to destroy my life. I've done
nothing wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Similar troubles have emerged at Wilson High in El Sereno. Principal
Marcella Contreras had what the audit called "a closed-door policy" that
left her unable to attack the school's problems. Contreras has been
reassigned and has left the school, officials said. She could not be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   A major reconstruction of Wilson during the last four years caused
logistical headaches, teachers said. Students said this week that the
poor conditions disrupted learning.</TE>
<TE>   "The restrooms are all tagged up, and there's no doors so you don't
have any privacy," sophomore Juan Bautista, 17, said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   At Mount Vernon, teachers agreed with auditors' findings that the
school wastes instructional time. But they declined to be identified,
saying they feared losing their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   One teacher said her classes were filled with students not fluent in
English. "These students need one-on-one work," she said. "They're
reading at a second-grade level, and I'm supposed to teach them very
sophisticated material."</TE>
<TE>   In Boyle Heights, auditors who visited Roosevelt High School found
that the quality of English instruction varied from classroom to
classroom. In interviews this week, teachers complained about students'
low literacy levels.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a math teacher, but now I have to spend 10 minutes of every class
not covering math, but working on English," said Jina Cano, a Roosevelt
teacher for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Principal Henry Ronquillo acknowledged that he "hadn't found a way to
overcome" students' poor reading scores. But he said he had too few
English teachers to meet the challenge--an issue cited by the audit.</TE>
<TE>   Ronquillo said he was surprised to learn that he was on the list of
principals to be reassigned. He said he had been thinking about early
retirement anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had known there was a memo [to reassign me], I would have stayed
and fought it," said Ronquillo, a community leader in Boyle Heights.
"That bothers me."</TE>
<TE>   The state education official who oversaw the audits said it was
obvious to investigators that no progress could be made until new leaders
were brought into some of the schools.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't a lot of time here to either rebuild trust or reestablish
credibility, and the issues are absolutely urgent," said Leslie Fausset,
a chief deputy superintendent with the state Department of Education. "So
in some instances, starting afresh seemed to be the best recommendation."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers, however, said that ousting school leaders is no sure
recipe for successful reform. That is especially true, they warned, at
campuses that already have trouble attracting experienced teachers and
administrators and whose students struggle to overcome the disadvantages
of poverty.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge assumption that if you throw the scoundrels out, there
are all these people waiting in the wings to come and turn around
schools," said Betty Malen, a professor of education policy at the
University of Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Said Susan Moore Johnson of Harvard's Graduate School of Education:
"Unless there is a sustained, well-financed plan to address issues of
health, poverty and the need for specialized professional development,
the long-term prospect for the schools is poor."</TE>
<TE>   Chaos often follows such shake-ups, detracting from efforts to improve
instruction, Malen has found. "People were just scrambling to bring order
to a school . . . opportunities for innovations were very limited," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles campuses targeted by state auditors were among a
larger group of schools warned five years ago that they had to make
dramatic improvements. But they failed to do so, which put them under
outside scrutiny from the California Department of Education.</TE>
<TE>   Romer called the audits of the 10 schools accurate, and acknowledged
that similar conditions plague dozens of other campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Romer last fall identified 14 additional schools that he said
were on the brink of failure. At the time, Romer said management changes
might be necessary at all of those schools to push them in a new
direction.</TE>
<TE>   The schools' new leaders face enormous challenges. The district and
state have agreed on detailed recovery plans for each campus, but those
plans set tight deadlines for revamping teaching methods, improving
attendance, and launching remedial reading programs.</TE>
<TE>   Sun Valley and Roosevelt high schools, for example, will be subdivided
into smaller "academies" so instruction can be personalized.</TE>
<TE>   In other parts of the country, L.A. Unified's actions were viewed with
some trepidation by school leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Some principals fear they will be penalized for budgetary and
instruction problems beyond their control. Gerald N. Tirozzi, executive
director of the National Assn. of Secondary School Principals, noted that
it is easier to remove a principal than to remove weak teachers, who
enjoy strong union protections.</TE>

<HD>Camps Thrive in Pakistan, India Charges</HD>
<DH>Asia: Spy agency says Islamabad won't dismantle 17 terrorist
training complexes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<AU>SIDHARTHA BARUA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI
</DL>
<LD>While pressure mounts on Pakistan to take tougher action against
terrorism, India's top spy agency charges that Pakistani President Pervez
Musharraf has done nothing to dismantle what it says are at least 17
terrorist training camps in territory under his control.</LD>
<LD>   India's equivalent of the CIA, the Research and Analysis Wing, has
identified the training camps in Pakistani-controlled areas of the
disputed Kashmir region and Pakistan proper. The camps are used to train
fighters for three Pakistan-based groups battling to end Indian rule in
Kashmir, a senior Indian intelligence source said, speaking on condition
he not be identified because of the clandestine nature of his work.</LD>
<LD>   At least two of the three groups have links to Osama bin Laden's Al
Qaeda terrorist network, according to the RAW, which answers directly to
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.</LD>
<TE>   Although Musharraf insists publicly that he is determined to end all
forms of terrorism, there is no evidence that his government has tried to
shut down the camps, the Indian intelligence official said.</TE>
<TE>   "He is incapable at this point in time to move against these camps
physically. And he knows it," the official said. Referring to Musharraf's
role in the U.S.-led war on terrorism, he said, "Beyond a point,
Washington cannot pressure Musharraf because the entire strategy of
sustaining him then gets distorted.</TE>
<TE>   "We accept that he requires time. But at this point, I would say he
has not done anything that reflects sincerity in the anti-terrorism
campaign that Islamabad is embarking on."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan said
the anti-terror crackdown will continue.</TE>
<TE>   "Pakistan is taking certain actions," he said in Islamabad, Pakistan's
capital. "Pakistan will continue to take actions against terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf is expected to announce stricter measures against at least
some Kashmiri separatist groups, and may even ban the most extreme, when
he makes a much-anticipated speech to his nation in the next few days.</TE>
<TE>   India, which has heard Pakistani leaders promise to help root out
international terrorism before, will want to see any promises of a new
policy quickly followed by significant action, such as the closing down
of the alleged training camps.</TE>
<TE>   After the first bombing of New York's World Trade Center in February
1993, the Clinton administration threatened to put Pakistan on a list of
states sponsoring terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But the following July, the State Department removed Pakistan from a
watch list after Washington received assurances that the Pakistani
government would cooperate. More than eight years later, India insists
that Pakistan has done little to keep its word.</TE>
<TE>Camps Can Easily Be Moved, India Says</TE>
<TE>   If Musharraf closes down some or all of what India claims to be
terrorist bases, New Delhi will then want to make sure that they aren't
reopened somewhere else.</TE>
<TE>   "In our assessment, a camp is just a kitchen, a shooting area, a small
training ground and maybe barracks," the Indian source said. "It can
easily be moved. It can easily be restructured."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the camps India wants shut down are in villages and towns in
the roughly one-third of Kashmir under Pakistani control. They include
Barakot, Bhimber, Kotli, Chilas, Astor, Gilgit, Skardu and Muzaffarabad,
according to Indian intelligence sources.</TE>
<TE>   But India claims that there is also a training camp in Swat, in
Pakistan's lawless North-West Frontier province.</TE>
<TE>   India believes that three groups operate from the camps--in most
cases, sharing them--and suspects that most of the camps are used by
Lashkar-e-Taiba, the most feared guerrilla force in Indian-controlled
Kashmir. The other two guerrilla forces are Harkat Moujahedeen and Hizbul
Moujahedeen.</TE>
<TE>   Lashkar-e-Taiba, or Army of the Pure, is a chief suspect behind the
Dec. 13 terrorist attack on India's Parliament, in which 14 people died,
including the five gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian spy agency has what it says is proof that all five
attackers were Pakistani citizens, including tape recordings of cell
phone calls that two of the gunmen made to their homes in Pakistan before
the assault.</TE>
<TE>   The calls, recordings of which have been given to the CIA, lasted
about four minutes on the evening before the assault on Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   "They were conversations with their families along the lines of: 'We
are planning something. Don't worry about us.' The tension in the voice
and tenor of speech all gave away a lot of things," the intelligence
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Police later found more than 10 pounds of RDX plastic explosive in the
men's car, which had failed to explode. Investigators say it is also
clear that the RDX came from Pakistan because, they claim, it is stamped
with the city of origin: Lahore.</TE>
<TE>   Lashkar-e-Taiba is the militant wing of the Markaz al Dawa Wal Irshad,
or Center for Preaching, which has its headquarters in Muridke, about 30
miles from Lahore in eastern Pakistan, a second Indian intelligence
official said.</TE>
<TE>   The 190-acre headquarters has been used to provide military training
in three-week and three-month courses, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not overtly proactive [in training] anymore, but it can be
activated within no time," the senior official said.</TE>
<TE>   Markaz and Lashkar-e-Taiba joined Bin Laden's International Islamic
Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders in 1998, India says. Bin Laden
issued a fatwa, or religious edict, calling on Muslims to attack
Americans, including civilians.</TE>
<TE>   The signatures on the fatwa included Maulana Fazlur Rehman Khalil, who
until a year ago was leader of another Pakistan-based group fighting in
Kashmir, Harkat Moujahedeen.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani police detained Khalil for a week in early October, at the
start of the U.S. airstrikes in Afghanistan but released him.</TE>
<TE>   Khalil's organization grew out of Harkat Ansar, a guerrilla faction in
the Afghan war against Soviet occupation in the 1980s that was backed by
Pakistan's military intelligence, the Inter-Services Intelligence agency,
or ISI.</TE>
<TE>   That complex evolution is an example of how South Asia's militias
frequently splinter or morph into new organizations that can plot
terrorist attacks in the name of the struggle to liberate Kashmir, Indian
authorities complain.</TE>
<TE>   Maulana Masood Azhar, a former leader of Harkat, formed
Jaish-e-Mohammed after India released him from jail in December 1999 in a
deal to free passengers on an Indian Airlines flight hijacked to
Kandahar, Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Azhar is on a list of 20 people, about half of whom are Indian
nationals, whom New Delhi wants Pakistan to extradite for trial on
terrorism, hijacking, drug-trafficking and other charges.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf could prove his credibility in the war on terrorism if he at
least handed over Indians Dawood Ibrahim and Tiger Memon, the main
suspects in a string of bombings in Bombay that killed 257 people and
wounded 713 others in March 1993, the senior official said.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest risk [to Pakistan's ISI] if [Ibrahim] comes to us is the
damaging account he can give of the linkages, because Dawood is the point
man for Al Qaeda," the senior official said. "He was the contact man for
funding certain Taliban-related things.</TE>
<TE>   "He is an ISI mentor, not an agent. He is a big gun with assets worth
millions of dollars. So it would not be a token handing-over. Once we had
access, we would interrogate him and what followed could be very
damaging."</TE>
<TE>   New Delhi has provided Musharraf's government with Ibrahim's addresses
in the Pakistani cities of "Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi, his telephone
numbers, photographs of his houses and the women he is with--everything,"
the source said. "He is not hard to find at all."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell appeared to support
India's demand that Musharraf extradite at least some of the 20 suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "We have discussed the list with him. I know he is examining it, and I
hope he will take appropriate action on this list," Powell said in
Washington. "But it is in his hands."</TE>
<TE>   Powell plans to fly to India and Pakistan next week to press for a
diplomatic solution to the nations' dangerous confrontation, which
erupted after the Dec. 13 attack.</TE>
<TE>   India sees the training camps not only as a measure of Musharraf's
real intentions but as potential targets if New Delhi decides to follow
the U.S. and Israeli examples and launch military strikes to take out
alleged terrorist bases.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian spy agency has concluded that the Kashmiri separatist
groups can survive only with continued logistics, training and other
support from Pakistan. In turn, Pakistan accuses the RAW of trying to
destabilize Pakistan through secret support for militants who have
carried out car and bus bombings in several Pakistani cities during the
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   By detaining suspected terrorists but not yet charging them with
criminal offenses, Musharraf is only doing enough "to placate Washington
and London," said the senior Indian intelligence source, who has several
decades of experience tracking Pakistan's support for Kashmiri
separatists.</TE>
<TE>   "He has not done enough to structurally, or quantitatively, damage the
jihad [holy war] framework," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite daily clashes between Indian and Pakistani forces along a 1972
cease-fire line in Kashmir known as the Line of Control, guerrilla
fighters continue to infiltrate Indian-controlled Kashmir from bases in
Pakistani-controlled areas, the Indian intelligence source said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now only the really daring ones are coming across, the ones who have
absolutely safe bases in the other [Pakistani-held] part of Kashmir," he
said.</TE>
<TE>Many See Musharraf as 'Indispensable'</TE>
<TE>   India sees the Bush administration's strong support for Musharraf as
part of a pattern in U.S.-Pakistani relations that has treated that
country's military rulers as stabilizing forces that can stop the spread
of Islamic extremism.</TE>
<TE>   The late Gen. Zia ul-Haq, who seized power in 1977, was a key U.S.
ally on a front line of the Cold War. But he built popular support by
making Islam a more powerful force in society and the military. Musharraf
is now trying to tame the monster that Zia set loose.</TE>
<TE>   "The world view is that he is indispensable, he is the 'last bastion'
of Islamic moderation, and if he goes, you open the corridors to an
extremist takeover," the senior Indian intelligence official said.</TE>
<TE>   "The same logic had also been adhered to when Zia was in power.
Western calculations were, 'When Zia goes, there will be chaos, hellfire
and all of that.' "</TE>
<TE>   But even as Vajpayee refuses to talk with Musharraf about a way out of
the current crisis, Indian officials acknowledge privately that they
think they could eventually reach a deal with him.</TE>
<TE>   Their real worry is the military, and especially the ISI, because they
doubt that Musharraf has complete control over a powerful apparatus that
is united only by a goal as old as Pakistan itself: unification with
Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   "You need a tectonic change--in attitude, in psychology, in personnel
and in tactics on Kashmir," the senior Indian intelligence source said.</TE>

<HD>The Call of Balkan Realms</HD>
<DH>The region's royals are returning from exile, seeking political
influence, monarchical restoration or simply to serve their nations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia
</DL>
<LD>Sitting on a bench in this decayed capital, a retired high school
teacher poured out his pain from long years of misrule, wars,
international sanctions and social rot.</LD>
<LD>   "You can see these people are very beautiful, very good-looking," said
Vojislav Todorovic, 69, motioning toward downtown passersby. "But they
are very sad. Hardly anyone smiles in this country. Everything was
destroyed. People have nothing. . . . Everything has a bad stench. Love
is gone. Young people have totally wrong values."</LD>
<LD>   Todorovic sees hope, however, in Crown Prince Alexander II
Karadjordjevic, the London-born heir to the Yugoslav throne, who moved
into an ancestral palace in Belgrade last summer and has worked hard to
build his popularity.</LD>
<TE>   "I look forward to the moment when he will become king," Todorovic
said. "The monarchy would overcome the divisions among the people."</TE>
<TE>   During decades of communism, Alexander and other exiled Balkan royalty
were nearly forgotten. Now kings and princes, queens and princesses are
reemerging from exile, moving into old palaces and seeking political
influence, monarchical restoration or simply ways to serve their nations.</TE>
<TE>   This second chance for the region's crowned and would-be-crowned heads
has arisen out of the social upheaval that followed the collapse of
communism. It reflects the shortcomings of party politics in countries
without strong democratic traditions, and a desire to get beyond the
tragic memories of Nazi and Communist rule by restoring proud traditions.
Throughout the Balkans, broken societies are searching for saviors.</TE>
<TE>   The region's young democracies would be strengthened by restoring
their monarchs, supporters argue. They often cite Spain's return to a
monarchy with Juan Carlos I's ascension to the throne in 1975 and the
king's role in backing democracy after the death of dictator Francisco
Franco.</TE>
<TE>   Most Balkan royals say they favor Britain's constitutional monarchy,
where Queen Elizabeth II plays a figurehead role as head of state and
symbol of the nation while real power lies with the elected government.
At the very least, all the royals aim to be symbols of unity for their
troubled nations. Most have tried to nudge their countries toward
restoring their thrones, without appearing too eager.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, support for the constitutional changes needed to reinstate
monarchies has not been strong. The politics of the region, however, are
unpredictable.</TE>
<TE>   Bulgarian voters' longing for a royal solution already has catapulted
former King Simeon II Saxe-Coburg-Gotha of Bulgaria--a long-ago child
monarch who until last year was an obscure Madrid businessman--into real
power for the first time in his adult life. He created a party that came
out of nowhere to win elections in June, making him prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander, 56, is a former insurance broker with British manners and a
limited ability to speak his people's language--but a knack for the
public relations of monarchical restoration. He is now prominent in
Belgrade's elite, and some who once dismissed him as a joke believe that
he may have a growing role to play--especially if the ruling coalition
self-destructs from infighting.</TE>
<TE>   An Ipress poll released last month in Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia, showed 20% of respondents favoring restoration of the
monarchy. That level of support is enough to make Alexander a player.</TE>
<TE>   Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, 64, also reflects the orientation of someone who
from childhood has been imbued with the democratic values of Western
Europe. But he has the advantage of speaking fluent Bulgarian.</TE>
<TE>Claimants to Thrones</TE>
<TE>   The other claimants to the region's thrones are Romania's King Michael
I Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, 80; Albania's King Leka I Zogu, 62; and
Prince Nicholas II Petrovic Njegos, 57, of Montenegro, the smaller
republic in Yugoslavia.</TE>
<TE>   During his reign in World War II, Michael was a figurehead controlled
by a pro-Nazi regime. But in 1944 he led a coup that moved his country to
the Allied side. Only in the last year has he won full acceptance from
Romanian authorities, enjoying a reconciliation dinner in May with
President Ion Iliescu, a former Communist. Michael has recovered some
dynastic properties--including a 17th century castle--but is based in
Switzerland, where he has lived for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Leka, a 6-foot-8-inch gun-toting former arms merchant living in South
Africa, faces charges in Albania of carrying an unlicensed firearm, which
stem from a violent 1997 riot he allegedly provoked the last time he was
in the country. Although he has yet to return to Albania, Leka claims
that he could bring political stability and unity--and has expressed
support for expansion of the nation's borders to include heavily ethnic
Albanian parts of neighboring countries.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas is a Paris architect who seems mainly interested in
supporting the arts in Montenegro but also has said he would be happy to
be king. He has use of part of the Blue Palace, the former royal
residence in Cetinje, once Montenegro's capital. The republic has named
him its unofficial representative in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   These men, however, do not play such important roles in the life of
their homelands as do Crown Prince Alexander and Prime Minister
Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.</TE>
<TE>   A man of liberal ideas and democratic tendencies, Alexander spoke out
repeatedly from both inside and outside Yugoslavia against then-President
Slobodan Milosevic in the 1990s, before such opposition became popular.
More recently, Alexander helped unify the country's democratic
opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics disparage his Serbian, which he speaks with a heavy
accent, atrocious grammar and a frequent inability to come up with the
right words. Aleksandar Nikolic, a Belgrade bookstore owner, recalled
hearing the crown prince speak at an opposition rally while Milosevic was
in power. "I was laughing all the time," Nikolic said. "The way he puts
his sentences together in Serbian is ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   But Alexander's royal bloodline can still work magic.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring of 1999, as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's
bombs were raining down on Yugoslavia, Zoran Djindjic--then a key
opposition leader who is now Serbia's prime minister--was being
interviewed when his mobile phone rang. The caller was Alexander, and
Djindjic adopted a tone of enormous respect.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander organized several conferences outside Yugoslavia that
brought together opposition leaders and helped set the stage for
Milosevic's ouster in 2000. The reward came last July: the keys to his
family's Belgrade palaces.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Alexander and his wife, Crown Princess Katherine, have
worked to build influence, visiting everything from vegetable markets to
medical clinics. They were smart, swift or lucky enough to get control of
the Web site http://www.royalfamily.org, which displays photos showing
them at ceremonial events. The site also carries material about
Alexander's three sons from a previous marriage: Peter, 21, and
19-year-old twins Philip and Alexander. All were born in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about restoration of the monarchy, Alexander makes it clear that
this is what he wants, but he also says the people's needs come first.</TE>
<TE>   "When my great-grandfather came back as king [in a dynastic
restoration], it was done through a parliamentary process," he said in
July during his first news conference at the royal compound in Belgrade.
"So we do have in our history that kind of formula, and I think we ought
to study that carefully. But the most important factor today is to make
sure that people have jobs. . . . Let's crown jobs first."</TE>
<TE>   Like a politician on the stump, Alexander also noted that his family
has always been "a people's monarchy."</TE>
<TE>   The 19th century founder of the dynasty--Karadjordje, or "Black
George"--was a commoner, the son of a poor peasant from central Serbia.
He became a wealthy trader, and because pigs were Serbia's main export at
the time, opponents of the monarchy often describe him as a "pig
merchant." He led an 1804 uprising against the Ottoman Empire. The revolt
was crushed in 1813 but still gave Serbs their first taste of freedom
after four centuries of Turkish rule.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Alexander's profile has risen in recent months, apparent
squabbles among relatives--spoken of publicly by his cousin, Princess
Elizabeth Karadjordjevic--have provided grist for the Belgrade media.</TE>
<TE>   The reports suggest that Elizabeth, the mother of actress Catherine
Oxenberg, has felt shunned by Alexander and Katherine since they moved to
Belgrade last year. Elizabeth has been quoted as saying that just as the
Communists did in 1946, Alexander "banned" her from the royal compound
where she was born. The gossip echoes the attention that Britain's
tabloids give to that nation's royals.</TE>
<TE>   All the Balkan dynasties, with the exception of the relatively young
Albanian one, are distantly related to the British royal house and to
most of the other intertwined royal families of Europe.</TE>
<TE>   British sympathy for the Yugoslav dynasty was reflected at Alexander's
birth. His parents were living at Claridge's Hotel in London, and a
legitimate heir to the throne had to be born on Yugoslav soil. The
British government declared the couple's suite Yugoslav territory for the
birth.</TE>
<TE>   Bulgaria's prime minister had the advantage of being born in his own
country and spending his early childhood there. Saxe-Coburg-Gotha became
king in 1943 at age 6 after the death of his father, Boris III, and then
was expelled by the Communists in 1946. He grew up in Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Rapturous crowds greeted him when he first revisited his homeland in
1996, but he plunged into politics only last April. Drawing on an image
of high morality and compassion, he put together a movement with support
from the unemployed and the rural poor.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he attracted businesspeople. He gave top economic
jobs in his government to Western-educated economists with experience
working abroad. Since he took office, campaign promises of social
benefits have taken a back seat to control of government spending.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulgarian experience reflects both the advantages and the pitfalls
for a monarch in politics: By December, the prime minister's early
sky-high popularity had plummeted below 40% in polls.</TE>
<TE>   "Being king, a symbol of the nation, he managed . . . to mobilize a
lot of support. He really reached heaven," said Ivan Krastev, director of
the Center for Liberal Strategies, a think tank in Sofia, the capital.
"But this very broad coalition of expectations in a way backfired. He
became a victim of over-expectations. Being king, everybody expects him
to deliver a miracle, and no one can deliver a miracle."</TE>
<TE>More Suitable as a King</TE>
<TE>   Many observers believe that Saxe-Coburg-Gotha really wants to be king
again--and that by personality he is better suited for such a ceremonial
role.</TE>
<TE>   Restoration of the Bulgarian monarchy "is not on the public agenda,"
although "maybe it could be on his personal agenda," Krastev said. "The
perception of the miracle maker is not here anymore. Also, he's an old,
fragile person, working maybe 16 to 18 hours a day for the first time in
his life, and upset that others are not understanding how much effort he
is putting in. He has the feeling he's misunderstood, but the majority of
people have the feeling they are betrayed in their expectations."</TE>
<TE>   Todorovic, the retired teacher in Yugoslavia, is among those still
dreaming of what a king could do. He is convinced that the Karadjordjevic
dynasty has a future, maybe not just in the palace but also in electoral
politics.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander "has three nice kids," Todorovic said. "The little prince,
Peter, is very handsome, as handsome as a god. All the girls would vote
for him."</TE>
<TE>   Todorovic said he particularly appreciates how the royal family has
taken up humanitarian concerns. Both Katherine and Elizabeth often visit
hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrible Mira [Mirjana Markovic, Milosevic's unpopular wife] never
even sent condolences to victims. Has she ever visited the wounded and
sick?" he asked. "These unfortunate people [of Serbia] should look to the
royal palace and understand that some kind of light is coming from
there."</TE>

<HD>Tax Break Being Sought for Filming</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an aggressive step by state officials to combat runaway film
production, Gov. Gray Davis plans to propose California's first sizable
tax credit today in an effort to discourage film and TV shows from
fleeing to cheaper locales such as Canada.</LD>
<LD>   The Davis plan is being proposed to start in 2004 and is projected to
save producers $50 million the first year, $80 million the second and
$100 million by the third year, far more than any state program in the
past. The state has done little in the past, because it has historically
dominated filming.</LD>
<LD>   Davis is expected to unveil the plan at a meeting with Hollywood union
leaders in Burbank. He is seeking to grant producers a 15% tax credit on
the first $25,000 earned by a worker on lower-budget projects--probably
those of less than $10 million--provided that substantially all of the
production takes place within the state.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal is similar to recent federal proposals by lawmakers in
Washington seeking to blunt runaway production nationwide. The federal
proposal offers a 25% credit. The California credit would offset state
taxes applying to the companies that make the films.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis plan was welcomed by studio and labor representatives, even
though the announcement of the program raises questions about political
timing. Davis, who is facing reelection this year, is closely tied to the
labor movement in California, and the issue of runaway production is the
top concern of Hollywood's blue-collar unions with potentially tens of
thousands of jobs at risk.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be good for the economy of Southern California," said Jack
Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America. "The very fact
the governor is coming out with this presages good things."</TE>
<TE>   Davis had been considering a credit of as high as 25% but chose to
propose the lower number--and delay the start of the program until
2004--because of the state's $12-billion budget deficit, Deputy Press
Secretary Byron Tucker said.</TE>
<TE>   Because the tax credit is aimed at modest-budget productions, Davis'
program will affect neither major Hollywood films nor involve a credit on
the $20-million-a-picture salaries of stars such as Julia Roberts. It
won't even affect the typical Hollywood film, which now costs an average
of nearly $55 million to make. Instead, the credit targets the plethora
of smaller TV movies, independent films, cable productions, TV pilots and
other projects with smaller profit margins that have been fleeing
Hollywood in droves to such countries as Canada and Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he wants to send a message that California will compete
with other states and countries for productions.</TE>
<TE>   "We're creating an atmosphere that lets filmmakers know that
California really wants their business. This stimulus package will
provide a substantial financial boost to California's entertainment
community," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Some details have yet to be worked out, including the exact size of
productions affected and how much filming has to take place in California
to qualify. Tucker said those details would be resolved with legislators.
In the past, proposals for tax credits have received a cool response out
of concern they might be seen as giveaways to big studios.</TE>
<TE>   Runaway production has been a problem for nearly two decades in
Hollywood, accelerating rapidly during the 1990s when studies show the
number of U.S.-developed productions shot in foreign countries doubled to
about one in four now.</TE>
<TE>   A 1999 report by the Directors Guild of America and the Screen Actors
Guild estimated that nearly $3 billion in production leaves the U.S.
annually, the largest chunk affecting California.</TE>
<TE>   That study estimated the overall economic effect at more than $10
billion when the losses ripple through the economy, although some
economists have disputed that number as too high.</TE>
<TE>   Canada has been especially aggressive at luring projects, offering
government financial incentives on top of a weak Canadian dollar and
lower wages that make shooting about 25% cheaper there, according to
union and federal studies. Productions with stories set in the U.S. but
shot or scheduled to be shot in Canada include the upcoming Civil War
movie "Cold Mountain" and the popular new WB series "Smallville," set in
Kansas. Even the prime-time Fox soap opera "Pasadena" opted to shoot for
budget reasons in Vancouver, British Columbia, instead of its namesake
city.</TE>
<TE>   Calls for legislative action to blunt runaway production have been
voiced for years. The movement gained momentum in the last year as the
industry's fortunes declined, California's economy softened and pressures
increased to tighten budgets.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment employment in Los Angeles County slid by 32,900 from its
high of 272,000 in November 1999, according to the Los Angeles County
Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "People have always looked at this industry like it's a big
moneymaking, money-grabbing business. But it's cyclical, and people from
technical workers to actors are freelance. The industry provides
employment for working families who need the money and benefits to
survive," said Joseph Aredas, the top West Coast official for the
International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.</TE>

<HD>Nevada Site Picked for Nuclear Waste</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Energy secretary recommends Yucca Mountain, mobilizing
foes. Issue goes to Bush.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham on Thursday selected Nevada's
Yucca Mountain, 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, as the final resting
place for tens of thousands of tons of nuclear waste.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement opens a critical new stage in a 40-year search for a
safe storage place for the vast quantities of highly radioactive material
now at nuclear power plants and other facilities in 39 states.</LD>
<LD>   Citing a new rationale for supporting the federal government's
long-held preference for one national nuclear dump, Abraham told Nevada
Gov. Kenny Guinn in a letter, "We should consolidate the nuclear wastes
to enhance protection against terrorist attacks."</LD>
<TE>   But Abraham does not have the final word on the fate of the wind-swept
desert mountain, and his official choice only energized the vehement
opposition to the project in Nevada and among environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   The question of how to put all of the nation's radioactive waste in
one central storage facility has vexed government officials because of
the risks posed by transporting the spent fuel and long-term storage.
Keeping it where it is, however, also poses risks. The wastes contain
radioactive elements that remain active, and potentially
life-threatening, for hundreds of thousands of years.</TE>
<TE>   Under law, President Bush must decide whether to approve Abraham's
recommendation. He has signaled his strong support for consolidating
nuclear waste in one depository, and since 1987 Yucca Mountain has been
the only site under active consideration in the United States. The
government has spent $6 billion studying the site.</TE>
<TE>   If Nevada state officials formally oppose the president's decision, as
expected, Congress will have 90 legislative days to vote on the matter.
If a simple majority in both chambers votes for the project, as is
anticipated, it would go forward to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for
licensing. That process could take several years and the project still
could be rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's announcement was seen by supporters of the Yucca site as a
symbolic groundbreaking for the facility, but opponents viewed it as the
first shot in a final, fierce battle to keep nuclear waste out of the
mountain.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, both sides used the threat of terrorist attacks to
support their case. While Abraham said that keeping the waste on-site at
nuclear power plants posed a risk of terrorist attacks, environmentalists
argued that transporting it to Yucca Mountain on thousands of trucks and
train cars would increase that risk.</TE>
<TE>   Abraham stressed that the Yucca Mountain site is "technically
suitable" and "the science behind this project is sound."</TE>
<TE>   He said the site will support nuclear nonproliferation aims by
providing a secure place to put nuclear waste from decommissioned
weapons; play a key role in protecting the nation's energy security by
ensuring a safe future for nuclear energy, which accounts for 20% of the
nation's energy needs; and help the environment by providing a storage
site for nuclear material from cleanups of defense waste sites.</TE>
<TE>   Guinn said Abraham broke the news to him in a morning phone call. He
said he used an expletive to convey the depth of his disappointment to
Abraham and added that the secretary could expect him to veto the
project, which would send it to Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "I explained to him we will fight it in Congress, in the Oval Office,
in every regulatory body we can--we'll take all of our arguments to the
courts," Guinn said. "This fight is far from over."</TE>
<TE>   The state of Nevada already has sued to block the development of Yucca
Mountain on environmental grounds and has threatened more lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   "At the conclusion of the call I told the secretary that I think this
decision stinks, the whole process stinks and we'll see him in court,"
Guinn said.</TE>
<TE>   Working in Nevada's favor is the fact that one of its senators, Harry
Reid, is now the majority whip, which could help win the votes of other
Democrats. Reid said Thursday that if the decision comes down to
Congress, he will use all his power to block development of a repository
in Yucca Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   He is counting on the support of senators from both parties whose
constituents are unsettled by the thought of tons of nuclear wastes being
transported through their regions.</TE>
<TE>   "The nuclear waste is not going to suddenly appear at Yucca Mountain
one night," Reid said. "Thousands of trucks and trains are going to carry
it through the country. People don't like the idea of it, and since Sept.
11, they like it even less."</TE>
<TE>   Officials in San Bernardino County, which shares a border with Nevada
and through which nuclear waste will travel, shared similar concerns
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "The county believes the U.S. Department of Energy has not adequately
addressed the risk posed to communities along the nuclear waste route,"
spokesman David Wert said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Reid conceded that it will be difficult to get 51 senators to
vote against the site.</TE>
<TE>   And the House would likely approve the Yucca Mountain site.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), chairman of the House subcommittee with
jurisdiction over nuclear energy policy, said developing a repository at
Yucca Mountain is an "integral" step in ensuring the future of nuclear
power as a key part of the nation's energy supply.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the administration's decision pointed to a Government
Accounting Office report released late last month that said it was
"premature" by several years to recommend the site because of the many
unresolved technical and scientific issues on the project.</TE>
<TE>   The report by the nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress said
hundreds of scientific tests and experiments must still be conducted to
determine if nuclear waste can be safely stored in containers below Yucca
Mountain for more than 10,000 years. The GAO said it didn't believe the
site would be operational before 2015.</TE>
<TE>   "Before anyone starts shipping hundreds of tons of radioactive waste
across America's highways and railways, the government needs to make sure
it is taking the safest, wisest course," Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.).</TE>
<TE>   But the nuclear industry praised Abraham's announcement, stressing
that the federal government has been legally obligated to start receiving
spent nuclear fuel from power plants since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "Nearly two decades of exhaustive analysis support this action," said
Joe Colvin, president and chief executive of the Nuclear Energy
Institute, which represents the commercial nuclear energy industry.</TE>
<TE>   The Energy Department has hoped to open the facility in 2010. Plans
call for it to store 77,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel.</TE>

<HD>Israel Flattens Buildings in Gaza Strip</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Army says it targeted Palestinian gunmen, but U.N.
official declares 114 families were made homeless. Hopes of cease-fire
are dashed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>The United Nations said the Israeli army demolished dozens of
Palestinian homes in the southern Gaza Strip town of Rafah on Thursday,
the day after Palestinian gunmen shot dead an Israeli army officer and
three soldiers at a nearby outpost.</LD>
<LD>   Early this morning, army tanks and bulldozers destroyed the runway at
the Palestinian-controlled Gaza International Airport close to Rafah, an
Israeli army spokesman said. The airport, a cherished symbol of
Palestinian national aspirations, has been shut down or damaged many
times by the Israelis since it opened in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses said that more than half a dozen tanks guarded bulldozers as
they ripped up the runway. The Palestinians had not yet finished
repairing damage from the last Israeli incursion into the airport, on
Dec. 4.</LD>
<TE>   Israel Radio said that the army also cut the main north-south road
that connects Rafah to Gaza City in the north and that it would take a
series of unspecified "other steps" in retaliation for the slaying of the
troops.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli military source in Gaza said that in Rafah, the army
knocked down only 13 buildings that had provided cover for gunmen and
concealed entrances to tunnels through which Palestinians smuggled arms
from Egypt. But Palestinians charged that the destruction was in
retaliation for Wednesday's attack on the army outpost. The two gunmen
who assaulted the army position--and who were killed during the
attack--were from Rafah.</TE>
<TE>   The latest developments dashed hopes here that a cease-fire to end
more than 15 months of bloodshed was within reach. A weeklong lull in
killings that ended with Wednesday's assault on the outpost had raised
hopes that U.S. envoy Anthony C. Zinni might be close to solidifying a
cease-fire and moving the sides back to talks.</TE>
<TE>   The fresh cycle of violence, coupled with Israel's capture last week
of a ship loaded with 50 tons of arms that Israel says were purchased
from Iran by the Palestinian Authority, has raised questions about what
Zinni can achieve if he returns here as expected Jan. 18.</TE>
<TE>   After Thursday's demolitions by the Israeli army, the militant
organization Islamic Jihad announced that it was rescinding its decision
to honor Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's Dec. 16 demand
that all Palestinian groups halt attacks on Israelis. Islamic Jihad and
Hamas, another militant Islamic group, had carried out a series of deadly
suicide bombings inside Israel before Arafat issued his demand.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting in the West Bank city of Ramallah with Mohammed Barakeh, an
Israeli Arab member of Israel's parliament, Arafat described the
bulldozing of the Rafah homes as "a crime against humanity." The
Palestinian leader said the destruction would make it hard to continue
his efforts to achieve a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   But even before the demolitions, Arafat's quest to compel compliance
by militants was in trouble. Hamas claimed responsibility for Wednesday's
assault on the Israeli outpost, although the group also had promised to
halt attacks within Israel. Arafat's security forces have met with
resistance when they have tried to arrest leading militants, and Israel
has dismissed as insignificant dozens of arrests that the Palestinian
Authority has made.</TE>
<TE>   As Palestinian families picked through the broken concrete and twisted
metal of their crushed homes Thursday, Israelis buried three of those
killed in the ambush on the border outpost. The dead were members of a
volunteer Bedouin reconnaissance unit deployed along the Israeli-Egyptian
border.</TE>
<TE>   At the funeral of Maj. Ashraf Awayesh Mazariv in the Israeli Arab
village of Zarzir, Hassan Heib, head of the village council, called on
the government to refrain from carrying out retaliatory strikes to avenge
the deaths of the four Arab soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "Understand our distress," Heib appealed to the government. "We, too,
are a part of Islam," he said, in a poignant summary of the dilemma many
of Israel's minority Arab citizens say the fighting poses for them. Heib
urged the government to resolve the conflict by returning to negotiations
with the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>Sharon Says Arafat Will Stay Confined to City</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said Thursday that the government
will reevaluate its attitude toward the Palestinian Authority "in light
of its failure to take any measures to disband the terror organizations,
arrest the terrorists, and collect illegal arms and hand them over to the
Americans for removal from the area."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon told activists from his Likud Party that he intends to confine
Arafat to his Ramallah headquarters until he hands over the killers of
Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi, who was assassinated in October.
"And if he [Arafat] has to sit there for years, so he will sit there for
years," Sharon said.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, President Bush said he suspected that the arms on the
seized ship were intended "to promote terror" in the Mideast. He said
Arafat "must renounce terror and must reject those in the region that
would disrupt the peace process by the use of terrorist means."</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell linked the Palestinian Authority to
the ship, which was intercepted in the Red Sea last week by the Israeli
military. But Powell said he has not seen proof that Arafat was involved.</TE>
<TE>   "The information we are receiving [from Israeli officials] and
developing on our own makes it clear that there are linkages to the
Palestinian Authority," he said Thursday. "I have not seen any
information that yet links it directly to . . . Arafat."</TE>
<TE>   Powell said U.S. Consul General Ronald Schlicher in Jerusalem would
meet with Arafat on Thursday and make it clear to him that "this is a
very serious matter."</TE>
<TE>   In Gaza, Issa Qarra, spokesman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency,
said the demolitions were the most extensive carried out by Israeli
troops against Palestinian homes since fighting erupted in September
2000. Social workers from the agency who surveyed the site Thursday
determined that 62 homes had been demolished. Some of them had been
abandoned, Qarra said, but 114 families were made homeless by the
operation.</TE>
<TE>   According to the U.N. agency, the Israeli army had destroyed 145 homes
in Rafah since fighting erupted, not including those destroyed Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Rafah, a border town run largely by gangs and militias, is one of the
most active fronts in Israel's battle with the Palestinians. The
Palestinian Authority has little control over the area, and cross-border
smuggling is one of the primary sources of income for many of the
residents.</TE>
<TE>   Clashes between troops and militants erupt almost daily. Israeli
soldiers, many of them Bedouin Arabs from the same unit that was attacked
Wednesday, hunker down in heavily fortified posts and patrol in armored
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Residents said about a dozen tanks and bulldozers rumbled into the
"Block O" neighborhood of the Rafah refugee camp shortly after midnight.
Militants fired at the troops, and a brief gun battle ensued, but no
casualties were reported.</TE>

<HD>A Last-Ditch Effort at Peace</HD>
<DH>S. America: As troops mass, Colombia's president gives the U.N.
until Monday to work with rebels on reviving the peace process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>As Colombia's armed forces stepped up preparations Thursday to
invade a demilitarized zone ceded to leftist rebels, President Andres
Pastrana granted a United Nations request to make a last-ditch effort to
resuscitate the nation's collapsed peace process.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout the day, the army and air force moved men and equipment
toward the Switzerland-sized zone, which has hosted peace talks for the
last three years between the government and the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC.</LD>
<LD>   Pastrana broke off talks Wednesday, giving the rebels 48 hours to
leave the zone. But late Thursday, Pastrana said he was granting 48 hours
more for the United Nations and international diplomats to try to reach a
breakthrough with the FARC. If no results followed, he said, the
guerrillas must leave the zone by Monday night.</LD>
<TE>   "The FARC have the responsibility to decide whether or not the peace
process continues," Pastrana said in a nationally televised address.</TE>
<TE>   But if hopes for peace lay with the FARC, they appeared misplaced.
Speaking shortly before Pastrana did, the rebels charged that the
government had abandoned talks, and the group offered no new concessions
to restart negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the rebels insisted that Pastrana holds the key to
resurrecting the process. They did, however, say they were willing to
meet with U.N. and European officials who have been monitoring the peace
process.</TE>
<TE>   "Who must return to the table is the government, not the FARC, since
the FARC hasn't left the table," rebel spokesman Raul Reyes said. "On the
contrary, we have presented a series of proposals directed at unsticking
the peace process."</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana's extension came at the request of the U.N.'s newly appointed
peace envoy to Colombia, James LeMoyne, who said peace negotiators needed
more time to prevent a new surge of violence in the country's
4-decade-old civil war.</TE>
<TE>   LeMoyne, a veteran of negotiations that ended the conflicts in Central
America during the 1990s, said he was discussing scenarios that would
allow talks to continue, but he declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   "I am absolutely convinced that there are forms to solve this current
crisis," LeMoyne said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was a measure of the gravity of the crisis that the United
Nations didn't immediately step in to offer its services as a third-party
mediator. One top U.N. official said the two sides are too far apart.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we're pushing very hard" to act as a mediator, the
official said. "The time just isn't ripe."</TE>
<TE>   Peace talks broke down over new restrictions that Pastrana imposed in
October after he accused the rebels of using the zone as a haven for
kidnapping and rebel training. Pastrana ordered military overflights of
the area and restricted the entry of foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels responded by insisting that the new restrictions were a
threat to their security and refused to negotiate further.</TE>
<TE>   FARC officials pledged to remain in the zone, even if Pastrana removed
its status as a demilitarized area.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been fighting here for more than 30 years. We will stay here,
zone or not," Carlos Antonio Lozada, a FARC negotiator, said Thursday in
a telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said the U.S. backs
Pastrana's actions, although he made no mention of lending equipment or
troops to support efforts to retake the zone by force.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. already is giving $1.3 billion in anti-narcotics aid to
Colombia as part of a plan to halve cocaine production. The U.S. recently
provided the Colombian army with 14 Black Hawk helicopters and has
trained three elite army battalions, but neither the troops nor the
aircraft are involved in attack plans, according to Colombian army
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope we do not find an upsurge in violence, and I hope that there
may still be found a way to move forward in whatever way President
Pastrana decides," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   Peace and church groups were struggling to find that way. They met
with U.N. officials early Thursday to ask for mediation but were told
that the FARC and the government had to make a formal petition. Both
sides have resisted outside intervention in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, concern grew about the fate of those living in the five
villages in the zone. Right-wing paramilitary groups have recently made
incursions into surrounding areas, and human rights groups are concerned
that the violent groups, responsible for the majority of massacres in
Colombia, will target civilians as guerrilla sympathizers.</TE>
<TE>   There were also reports that guerrillas were swapping their camouflage
for civilian clothes, making civilian deaths even more likely in a clash
between the army and the FARC.</TE>
<TE>   Although the peace process has frequently been on the verge of
failure, longtime observers were pessimistic about the chances of
continuing without third-party intervention.</TE>

<HD>Residency Bids Are Rejected</HD>
<DH>Courts: Hong Kong denies nearly 5,000 mainland Chinese the right to
stay despite their parents' legal status in the territory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG
</DL>
<LD>In an emotion-charged judgment, Hong Kong's highest court rejected
Thursday the appeal of nearly 5,000 mainland Chinese fighting for the
right to live with their parents, who are permanent residents of the
special administrative region.</LD>
<LD>   The court, however, ruled that between 200 and 300 others involved in
the case could stay. They include mainland Chinese who had applied for
Hong Kong residency before the territory's return to China in July 1997
or who had disregarded the regional government's advice to hold off on
filing for the status and thus established an early record of their
intent.</LD>
<LD>   Tensions outside the Court of Final Appeal building in central Hong
Kong ran high, and police presence was heavy. Some of those involved in
the case ran sobbing from the court and sought refuge in a nearby church.
Many said they would refuse to comply.</LD>
<TE>   "Win or lose, I'm not allowing my daughter to go back" to mainland
China, said garment industry worker Yin Wai-kam, clutching the hand of
her 21-year-old daughter, Fong Cho-kwan. "She is handicapped and needs
special attention."</TE>
<TE>   Franco Mella, a Roman Catholic priest who has helped residency seekers
throughout their legal battle, worked to calm those who wept
uncontrollably after the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "We will meet with the government and seek administrative relief," he
said. "This isn't over."</TE>
<TE>   Most of those rejected were born on the mainland to parents who then
moved to Hong Kong and became permanent residents here during the British
colonial era, leaving the children behind with their families.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights activists and lawyers for those seeking residency
condemned the ruling as unfair and arbitrary. Some claimed that it
constituted a dangerous weakening of the territory's judicial
independence, although others disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa announced that those affected
by the judgment would have until the end of March to return to the
mainland and called on them to accept the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "The court has made a clear decision," he said. "I hope all those
affected will accept it."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's ruling appeared to bring an end to one of Hong Kong's
bitterest, most controversial legal battles. After a three-year struggle,
Hong Kong's government managed to defend an immigration policy so
stringent that it blocks entry to the sons and daughters of many
residents. But the cost of victory was high.</TE>
<TE>   In August 2000, a group of emotionally exhausted applicants involved
in the case set fire to the 13th floor offices of the territory's
Department of Immigration, leaving two people dead, 50 injured and the
local community in shock.</TE>
<TE>   With a huge disparity of income between affluent Hong Kong and the
poorer mainland, government authorities argue that only a tough
immigration policy can prevent the territory from being inundated with
newcomers. The policy enjoys broad public support here.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the losing side complained that the ruling discriminated
against those who had accepted government assurances in late 1998 that
applicants need not take any steps until an existing case on the
right-of-abode issue was decided in the courts. Those assurances came as
the territory's legal assistance system was being overwhelmed by those
seeking residency.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, however, those who had ignored the government's advice won
the day because their individual actions had generated an early record of
intent to claim residency. The losers were those who accepted the
government's assurances or took their first legal steps only months later
by joining the case decided Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to envision a case where there has been a more
grievous injustice than this," said attorney Peter Barnes, who
represented 43 of those involved in the court action. "Those who ignored
the government's advice are all right, and those who obeyed it are left
with nothing. What does this say about the people's belief in
government?"</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference Thursday evening, Hong Kong's secretary for
security, Regina Ip, said the government had no remorse about its advice.</TE>
<TE>   Some legal specialists said Thursday's judgment did far more than dent
the government's credibility, arguing that it weakened the independence
of Hong Kong's judiciary. That independence was already tarnished by
Beijing's decision to overrule a January 1999 decision by the Court of
Final Appeal that gave the right of abode to any child of a Hong Kong
permanent resident.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's judgment in effect endorsed the tough position taken by
Beijing when the Communist government "reinterpreted" the 1999 ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Under the "one country, two systems" formula applied to Hong Kong when
it reverted to Chinese sovereignty, the former British colony retained
many of the rights of a democratic society, including a supposedly
independent judiciary.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew that [Beijing] had the power of reinterpretation, but until
today, we haven't known the extent to which judgments are affected,"
Barnes said.</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, claimed that although the judgment favored the
government, it also contained more language aimed at protecting the
principle that the court's rulings are final.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong-based social scientist Michael DeGolyer likened the judgment
to the historic U.S. Supreme Court case of Marbury vs. Madison in the
early 19th century. In that case, the court sided with the government,
but in the process it established the principle of judicial review that
elevated the court to the force it remains today.</TE>

<HD>Millions of Bank Accounts Are Frozen in Beleaguered Argentina</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>A few months ago, Luis Gonzales was laid off from his job as
produce manager at a suburban grocery store here. Like countless other
Argentines who have recently joined the ranks of the unemployed, he took
his severance pay--about $20,000--and put it in a savings account.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, Gonzales awoke to find that the government was holding
his money hostage. Under extraordinary new banking restrictions, he won't
be allowed to make any withdrawals until June 2003.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought it would be safer to put my money in the bank," said
Gonzales, who now makes ends meet as a chauffeur. "But now I know I
should have put it under my mattress instead."</LD>
<TE>   Millions of Argentines found themselves in a similar situation
Thursday, victims of a government plan to prevent a catastrophic run on
banks. Under the emergency measures, all deposits that were made in
dollars will be frozen until sometime between January and September of
next year, depending on the size of the account. Two-thirds of all bank
deposits here are in dollars.</TE>
<TE>   By freezing the savings of so many people and businesses for so long,
the measures will bring a sizable chunk of this nation's economy to a
standstill. Even some accounts in Argentine pesos will be frozen until
between March and December of this year.</TE>
<TE>   The measures struck a sharp blow at confidence in the nation's banking
system, seen by many as a pillar of strength and confidence just a year
ago.</TE>
<TE>   The restrictions are an especially bitter blow to a populace already
exhausted by recession, social upheaval and political instability that
has seen five men serve as president in less than a month.</TE>
<TE>   "If this keeps on going like this, they're going to start a civil
war," said Analia Vazquez, whose pharmaceutical supply company suddenly
lost the ability to spend $300,000 in desperately needed cash. "What
they've done is install a financial dictatorship."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday night, thousands of angry people, banging pots and chanting
insults, cut off traffic on half a dozen major streets in the capital.
Because violence has occurred in some previous protests, security was
increased around government buildings.</TE>
<TE>   News of the account freeze hit hard at all levels of society.</TE>
<TE>   "What will happen to someone who has $70,000 saved and needs to take
out 2,000 pesos a month to pay for things like food, medicine and rent?"
asked the daily newspaper La Nacion.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials said they had little choice but to implement the
measures, given the precarious state of the banking system. In the last
nine months, nervous customers have withdrawn $15 billion, about 20% of
all deposits.</TE>
<TE>   "This government is trying to build a new house out of the ashes,"
said Martin Redrado, a Foreign Ministry economist. "In any system, if you
have all depositors rushing into the bank to get [their money], it would
make the system crumble."</TE>
<TE>   Such statements come as little consolation to people like Gabriela
Hernandez, 26, who fears she and her husband may have lost most of their
$15,000 in savings for good.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're most afraid of is that the government will end up just
keeping all of the money," said Hernandez, an English teacher who
recently saw a 30% wage cut.</TE>
<TE>   In past economic crises in Latin America, governments have confiscated
dollar deposits and converted them into local currencies at a devalued
exchange rate, wiping out the savings of depositors. The Argentine
government has promised it will not take such measures.</TE>
<TE>   But many economists fear that the situation here could become much
worse before it gets better. Despite the government's attempts to put
barriers on the flight of capital, the very depth of the crisis and the
draconian nature of the banking freeze may drive even more money out of
Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   "That could serve to destabilize an already tenuous and fragile
environment," said Lawrence Goodman of Globalecon, a New York consulting
firm.</TE>
<TE>   Most economists see several threats on the horizon as Argentina moves
to devalue its currency. Exchange houses are scheduled to reopen today,
after a three-week government-ordered shutdown.</TE>
<TE>   "The most sobering scenario is that of hyperinflation," said William
R. Cline, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, a
Washington research firm. Just a decade ago, Argentina witnessed annual
inflation rates as high as 4,500%.</TE>
<TE>   The freeze on bank withdrawals also could sharpen Argentina's nearly
4-year-old recession. If that happens, it will only make the government's
budget deficit larger.</TE>
<TE>   The government of recently installed President Eduardo Duhalde finds
itself in a bind with no clear avenue of escape. The widely unpopular
banking freeze may provoke the middle-class protests that helped drive
former President Fernando de la Rua from office last month, bringing on a
wave of successors. On the other hand, the nation's banks might not
survive without the strict controls.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's an option," said Fernando Losada, an economist
with ABN Amro in New York. "Anxiety is still there. They lift the
controls and the money is gone."</TE>

<HD>Fujimori Seeks Image as Terror's Foe</HD>
<DH>Japan: In lecture, ousted Peruvian leader portrays himself as
vanquisher of leftist rebels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori sought Thursday to
reposition himself as a terrorism expert in his first public appearance
in months, even as he sidestepped raucous protesters who compared him to
Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   The ousted strongman's 90-minute guest lecture at Takushoku University
focused on what he said were his many accomplishments as president, his
misunderstood legacy and the lessons others could learn from his
experience fighting leftist terrorists in Peru.</LD>
<LD>   The exiled leader took no questions, discussed none of the thorny
issues surrounding his sudden departure from Peru 14 months ago, avoided
discussion of the corruption allegations leveled against him and was
whisked away in a black limousine.</LD>
<TE>   Outside the gates of the private university, several dozen protesters
waved signs reading "Fujimori, Go Back to Peru" and "Fujimori Guilty"
while shouting through a bullhorn that he is a thief and in the same
league as Bin Laden. The protesters were baited in turn by Takushoku
students who yelled obscenities from a few feet away.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just taking an exam, and it's so noisy I couldn't even
concentrate," said Tomoko Hanamata, a 21-year-old management student.
"Just look at all this."</TE>
<TE>   As Fujimori, 63, walked onto the university stage in a dark suit and
conservative tie, he looked the part of a well-dressed Japanese
"salaryman" heading for the office. Once he launched into his speech in
Spanish, however, his expressive intonation and animated gestures
suggested a far more passionate cultural background than the
buttoned-down Japan he now calls home.</TE>
<TE>   Fujimori's exile in his parents' native Japan has been sharply
condemned in Peru, which is trying to extradite him on corruption charges
and alleged human rights violations. Fujimori has repeatedly denied the
charges, however, and many Japanese have a neutral to positive view of
him.</TE>
<TE>   "In Japan, he's seen as robust and straightforward, a sort of ideal
Japanese man," said Yuji Seki, a Latin America expert with the National
Museum of Ethnology in Osaka. "Many people see him as having the
characteristics Japan needs right now."</TE>
<TE>   Fujimori shocked Peruvians and many outsiders in late 2000 when a
seemingly routine trip to Asia turned into a flight from his political
foes. Upon landing in Tokyo, he announced that he would remain and should
be eligible for Japanese citizenship given that his birth was registered
in the family's ancestral town of Kawachi. After mulling the issue over
for several days, Tokyo agreed on technical grounds, and he's been here
ever since.</TE>
<TE>   But Fujimori shows little sign of following other deposed leaders into
obscurity. Since his arrival, he has fired repeated shots at critics back
home on his Web site, in lengthy newspaper articles and through
occasional interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Most of his anti-terrorism speech involved a description of Peru's
economy, society and morale, along with a choppy video of car bombings
and bloody corpses detailing the terrorist legacy he inherited as
president.</TE>
<TE>   This was followed by a self-congratulatory wrap-up on how he improved
Peruvian life by reducing inflation to 10% from 7,600% and restoring
security throughout the country, accomplishments that complacent
Peruvians have quickly forgotten, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The packed hall of students and retirees, who endured tight security
to get in, applauded enthusiastically.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone in the audience, however, was impressed. "This is really
contradictory, because Fujimori borders on being a terrorist himself, yet
Japan continues to harbor him," said Tatsuya Yoshioka, head of Peace
Boat. "I feel ashamed as a Japanese that the government is doing this."</TE>
<TE>   Fujimori has support among right-wing groups in Japan and members of
the foreign aid establishment who built up a relationship with him during
his decade in power. Beyond that, many Japanese also feel an ethnic
connection.</TE>
<TE>   Fujimori's timing in speaking out appears to be tied to Peru's
extradition effort, said Takashi Asai, a 71-year-old retired trading
company executive, who said he found the speech thought-provoking.</TE>
<TE>   Fujimori hopes to bolster support in Japan so that he won't have to
return to Lima, the Peruvian capital, to face charges, Asai said. "He's
trying to protect himself and boost his reputation," he added. "I, for
one, certainly hope he stays in Japan and teaches us more about
terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Japan has no extradition treaty with Peru and has so far refused to
consider the South American country's request.</TE>

<DH>Balkans: Power-sharing feud keeps ethnic Albanian leader Rugova out
of the presidency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<AU>BLERIM GJOCI</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia
</DL>
<LD>Moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova failed to win the
Kosovo presidency in two rounds of voting Thursday as the separatist
province's new parliament deadlocked in a three-way standoff among his
party, former guerrillas and Serbian representatives.</LD>
<LD>   A first-place finish for Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo in
November elections positioned him as the leading candidate for president
in a new government planned for the U.N.-administered province, which
officially remains part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.</LD>
<LD>   But ethnic Albanian parties that emerged from the disbanded Kosovo
Liberation Army refused Thursday to support Rugova unless he reaches a
power-sharing agreement with them. His party has refused to do that,
insisting that it has won the right to administer Kosovo without formal
coalition partners.</LD>
<TE>   A similar standoff took place during a first round of voting for
president in December.</TE>
<TE>   With 22 seats in the 120-member parliament, the Serbian party, the
Return Coalition, could give the presidency to Rugova. But so far,
Serbian representatives have voted against Rugova or cast invalid protest
ballots.</TE>
<TE>   If Rugova wins office with just the support of his own party and
Serbian votes, he might be perceived as engaging in some kind of sellout,
which could undercut his future political strength.</TE>
<TE>   "The hour of truth is here," Sabri Hamiti, a top Democratic League
official, told parliament before Thursday's balloting. "We asked the
voters for a mandate, and we got it. This is why I call on everybody to
vote here today for [Rugova], a man well known to you all."</TE>
<TE>   But speakers from the Democratic Party of Kosovo, headed by former KLA
political leader Hashim Thaci, and from the Alliance for the Future of
Kosovo, headed by former guerrilla commander Ramush Haradinaj, criticized
Rugova's party for refusing to discuss a power-sharing arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   "The major political party did not make any step toward cooperation,
but to the contrary, they declared this process closed," Jakup Krasniqi,
a leading Democratic Party official, complained in parliament.</TE>
<TE>   The president will nominate a prime minister, who will head a
government with broad powers. Most ethnic Albanians, who make up the
great majority of Kosovo's population, hope creation of such a government
will pave the way to independence, which is opposed by the Serbs.</TE>
<TE>   Indirectly accusing Rugova of planning to win office with the support
of Serbian votes, Krasniqi declared that Rugova's party "should be
transparent about whose extra votes they are waiting for."</TE>
<TE>   Tensions between ethnic Albanians and Serbs remain high in Kosovo
after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's 11-week bombing campaign
in 1999 forced former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to pull his
forces out of the province, ending a crackdown against the
independence-minded ethnic Albanian population.</TE>
<TE>   The NATO-led peacekeeping force that entered in mid-1999 was unable to
prevent a wave of revenge attacks against Serbs, who still cannot move
freely and safely outside their enclaves.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, critics sought to raise further questions about Rugova's
possible reliance on Serbs to win election. Bedrush Collaku, a leader of
the small People's Movement of Kosovo, which also has roots in the former
guerrilla force, urged parliament to create a special commission to
"thoroughly investigate and verify the biography of Mr. Rugova, and to
find out what are his secret agreements and what did he sign with the war
criminals Milosevic and [Serbian President Milan] Milutinovic."</TE>
<TE>   Collaku's call was a clear reference to a meeting in Belgrade, the
Yugoslav and Serbian capital, that Rugova held under duress with
Milosevic during the NATO bombing. Although few question that he was
under enormous pressure at the time, many ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
still were disappointed when they saw video footage of Rugova at the
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Under U.N.-established rules, 80 votes are required to win the
presidency in the first or second round of balloting. After that, a
simple majority of 61 votes is enough to win.</TE>
<TE>   Rugova won 49 votes in the first round of balloting in December; 50 in
Thursday's initial vote; and 51 in the day's next ballot.</TE>
<TE>   No date was set for the next attempt to elect a president.</TE>

<DH>Military: Special Forces remember the first U.S. soldier killed by
enemy fire in Afghanistan.</DH>

<DL>SEATTLE
</DL>
<LD>As members of the U.S. Special Forces gathered near here Thursday
to remember Sgt. 1st Class Nathan Ross Chapman, the first U.S. serviceman
killed by enemy fire in Afghanistan, an Army commander urged Americans to
understand the reasons for the three-month-old conflict.</LD>
<LD>   "Think back to Sept. 11. Try and remember not where you were but how
you felt. Most were angered, confused, felt lost, grief-stricken all at
once," said Col. David P. Fridovich, commander of the 1st Special Forces
Group.</LD>
<LD>   "We reflected the same emotions Americans felt, but almost immediately
we began to ask the following: What do you want us to do, and where do
you want us to go?" Fridovich said. "How do we begin to fix this problem,
to right this wrong, and ultimately help win the war against a new and
different type of oppression?"</LD>
<TE>   As Chinook helicopters flew low overhead, towing a rippling U.S. flag
above the carpet of forest that surrounds the Ft. Lewis Army base,
military leaders unveiled a memorial stone bearing Chapman's name along
with those of 27 other group members killed since 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman, a 31-year-old Green Beret communications specialist with
combat service in Haiti, Panama and the Persian Gulf War, died Jan. 4
near the town of Khowst when he and an unidentified CIA operative were
slain by enemy fire after a meeting with local tribal elders. Though the
details of the firefight have not been disclosed, there are some reports
of the possible involvement of a 14-year-old Afghan in the shooting. The
CIA agent was wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Fridovich quoted a verse from Isaiah celebrating service to God.
"Nathan Chapman heard the call no fewer than five times in his military
career, and every time, without a second's hesitation, he said, 'Here I
am. Send me.' It deeply saddens us here today, but we now have a new
hero."</TE>
<TE>   Chapman's wife, Renae, clutched her 2-year-old daughter, Amanda, on
her lap and fought back tears as a sergeant called the roll for Chapman's
unit at Ft. Lewis. As each name was called, a soldier would shout: "Here,
sergeant major!"</TE>
<TE>   "Sgt. 1st Class Chapman," he called. When there was no answer, he
repeated: "Sgt. 1st Class Nathan Chapman. Sgt. 1st Class Nathan R.
Chapman." After a silence and a gun salute, taps was played. Sgt. Barry
Sadler's 1966 hit "Ballad of the Green Berets" sounded from a
loudspeaker.</TE>
<TE>   Fridovich presented posthumous medals to Chapman's wife and teddy
bears to Amanda and her 1-year-old brother, Brandon. Chapman's parents,
Wilbur and Lynn Chapman, also were present.</TE>
<TE>   In a video interview released by the Army, Renae Chapman said her
husband believed strongly in the U.S. role in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   A funeral service was scheduled on the base this morning, followed by
a procession to Tahoma National Cemetery.</TE>

<HD>Pilot: Straight, Proud and Tall</HD>
<DH>Crash: Marine Capt. Matthew Bancroft had achieved a goal set when
he was 7--to be a military flier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>REDDING, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>He was everyone's All-American gone to war. Tall, athletic, brainy
and ramrod straight--in stature and in his march through life--Capt.
Matthew W. Bancroft never took his eyes off the destination.</LD>
<LD>   When word came that Bancroft's tanker plane had gone down in Pakistan,
his parents fought hard to contain their grief amid the assault of fond
memories.</LD>
<LD>   This was the little boy who at 7 vowed he would go to the U.S. Naval
Academy and become a flier. Here was the high school student body
president always a couple of grades ahead of everyone in math. Later, as
a U.S. Marine Corps pilot, he once playfully buzzed his old hometown
three times in a lumbering KC-130.</LD>
<TE>   Bob and Beverly Bancroft sank into a living room couch Thursday, a day
after the news came. Matt's sister, 26-year-old Sarah, listened,
forlornly holding her baby.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the temptation, they refused to call their son a hero. They
will leave that to others.</TE>
<TE>   "That was Matt--tall, straight and proud," his father said between
sobs. "That was our son. That's the way he went down."</TE>
<TE>   The 29-year-old Marine was one of seven Marines killed when the plane
Bancroft was piloting crashed into a mountain in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   At his home base, Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, he
left his wife of two years, MaryEllen, their 9-month-old daughter,
Maddie, and her two sons, Sean, 13, and Christian, 12.</TE>
<TE>   Although his parents now live in Redding at the northern rim of the
Central Valley, Bancroft grew up in Burney, a tiny town in the wooded
mountains about 50 miles east.</TE>
<TE>   From an early age, he idolized Roger Staubach, the Naval Academy
football star who went on to pilot the Dallas Cowboys to Super Bowl
victories. Matt watched Navy football games and told everyone he would be
going to school there one day.</TE>
<TE>   "He set these goals," said Beverly Bancroft. "And he always reached
them."</TE>
<TE>   As he grew into a strapping, 6-foot-4 young man, Bancroft never veered
from the path. In school he always got the best grades while lettering in
three sports. He tutored other students. As a junior, having virtually
exhausted Burney High School's curriculum, Bancroft began taking
college-level classes.</TE>
<TE>   His mother remembered the day Bancroft heard he had been admitted to
the Naval Academy. He was like a little kid jumping up and down, she
said, shouting: "I made it! I made it!"</TE>
<TE>   He graduated in 1994 and got his wings in 1996 from the Marine Corps.</TE>
<TE>   But he never forgot about his home. Bancroft always carted along
aerial photos of Burney and the rolling hills of eastern Shasta County,
which he called God's country.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, dressed in a bright red U.S. Marine Corps T-shirt on this
dreary day, recalled how he once returned to his hometown airspace while
delivering gear for a Blue Angels air show in Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   Bancroft flew back and forth over the erstwhile lumber town,
population 4,000. The native son had returned.</TE>
<TE>   It was a rare display from someone who normally never strayed far from
the straight flight path through life. Beverly Bancroft said her son
wouldn't drive after even one beer.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his love of the Marines, Bancroft had begun thinking last fall
about starting a new chapter and leaving the service.</TE>
<TE>   But the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks derailed any plans he had of
mustering out, his parents said. The subsequent decline in air travel and
resulting layoffs squelched any easy move into commercial aviation. And
he wanted to join the fight with his comrades.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to go," Bob Bancroft said. "That's his job. He wanted to be
part of the team."</TE>
<TE>   Bancroft left for Afghanistan in December. He promised his family all
would be OK, that he was safe. And they took him at his word.</TE>

<HD>'Unspeakable Loss' Shakes Marine Base</HD>
<DH>Military: At Miramar, service members and their families rally at
the homes of the seven crash victims stationed there.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO
</DL>
<LD>As investigators Thursday tried to determine what caused the deadly
crash of a Marine Corps plane on a cargo mission in Pakistan, Marines
here mourned the loss of seven colleagues.</LD>
<LD>   "We are still in a state of shock," said Lt. Col. Carl Parker,
commanding officer of Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 352 at
the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. "There's no way to prepare for such
an unspeakable loss."</LD>
<LD>   One of the squadron's planes, a KC-130 Hercules, crashed as it
approached a military airfield called Shamsi. Six crew members and a
radio operator, all from the San Diego base, were killed.</LD>
<TE>   The incident marked the largest loss of life for the U.S. military in
the Afghanistan campaign and the death of the first female service member
in the war.</TE>
<TE>   "The loss of seven of our brave Miramar Marines has rocked our
community," San Diego Mayor Dick Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense officials said there is no evidence to suggest that the
plane--on a fuel hauling mission--was shot down by enemy fire during the
night flight.</TE>
<TE>   In a military housing complex near the Miramar base, Marines and their
tearful spouses rallied at the homes of the crew members to provide
emotional support to the families.</TE>
<TE>   "It's miserable," said Capt. Kent Kroeker, a KC-130 pilot. "I don't
have words to express how bad it feels to lose someone you love. It makes
me sad that chance conspired to take this air crew from us."</TE>
<TE>   As Kroeker spoke to reporters, three women pushing baby strollers
converged on one house. "It's a real close-knit community here," Kroeker
said. "People stand up for each other."</TE>
<TE>   Almost all the flying in Afghanistan has been at night to avoid
possible attack from Taliban and Al Qaeda forces, some armed with
shoulder-launched Stinger missiles.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are flying constantly," Kroeker said. "The last detachment
that returned to Miramar from Afghanistan looked really ragged. We take
off and land in austere conditions, fly at low levels and close to the
terrain. It's pretty rough doing that day after day. It's very grueling.
The cumulative effect starts getting to you."</TE>
<TE>   The KC-130s have played a key role in the U.S. campaign by
transporting cargo and troops and refueling helicopters and attack
aircraft in flight.</TE>
<TE>   The latter capability is particularly important because Afghanistan is
a landlocked country and much of the bombing campaign has been waged by
Navy and Marine Corps warplanes based on aircraft carriers in the
northern Arabian Sea.</TE>
<TE>   Midair refueling allows the planes to reach their targets deep inside
Afghanistan and to "loiter" over those targets waiting for opportunities
to strike.</TE>
<TE>   "The KC-130s helped us bridge the long distances," said Maj. Guillermo
Canedo, a spokesman at Marine Corps headquarters in Quantico, Va. "As an
amphibious force, we just could not have done this mission without the
refueling capability."</TE>
<TE>   Among pilots, praise for the KC-130 and other refueling "platforms" is
high. "We'd be out of business without them," said Capt. R.C. Thompson,
F/A-18 Hornet pilot and commander of the air squadrons aboard the carrier
John C. Stennis.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the age of many of the KC-130s--some nearly 40 years
old--Marine Corps officials said the plane has one of the best safety
records among military aircraft. The last "Class-A accident"--involving
loss of life or $1 million in damage--occurred in 1977, Canedo said.</TE>
<TE>   Parker said that the Miramar squadron's last accident was 27 years ago
and that the squadron has flown more than 200,000 accident-free hours.
Five of the squadron's 14 KC-130s have been deployed to assist in the war
on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps identified the dead as Capt. Matthew W. Bancroft, 29,
of Redding, Calif., the pilot; Capt. Daniel G. McCollum, 29, of Richland,
S.C., the co-pilot; Gunnery Sgt. Stephen L. Bryson, 36, of Montgomery,
Ala.; Staff Sgt. Scott N. Germosen, 37, of Queens, N.Y.; Sgt. Nathan P.
Hays, 21, of Lincoln, Wash.; Lance Cpl. Bryan P. Bertrand, 23, of Coos
Bay, Ore.; and Sgt. Jeannette L. Winters, 25, of DuPage County, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Winters was a radio operator based at Miramar.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with military policy, each of the seven families received
the news from Marines who visited their homes. The Marine Corps will
provide the families with spiritual, medical and financial support.</TE>
<TE>   Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 352 has taken part in every
U.S. military action since it was activated as a utility squadron April
1, 1943.</TE>
<TE>   Its logo, which looks similar to that of the Oakland Raiders football
team, shows an aircraft between a pair of crossed swords, beneath the
word "Raiders."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Central Command said the four-engine plane took off from
Jacobabad, Pakistan, and was making multiple stops.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have found no evidence of any attack, Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   He added that "the fireball occurred, according to the best evidence
we have, as it hit the ground--not before it hit the ground."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators had reached the scene early Thursday but were unable to
remain amid bad weather on a ridge inaccessible to vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   They returned later and were working on recovering victims' bodies,
defense officials said.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush said in a visit to the Pentagon to sign a defense
spending bill, "America recently has been reminded that in our quest to
defend freedom--and really in our quest to save civilization--there are
enormous sacrifices, and to no more greater sacrifice than loss of life."</TE>
<TE>   At the Kandahar airport in southern Afghanistan, where the KC-130s
have been based, Marines lowered the U.S. flag to half-staff.</TE>
<TE>   A replacement plane and crew from Miramar will go to Afghanistan to
assume the duties of the plane that crashed.</TE>
<TE>   "The mission goes on," Parker said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Warns Iran Against Afghan Meddling, Aiding Terrorists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush told Iran on Thursday that it faces serious
retribution from the United States if it tries to destabilize the new
interim government in Afghanistan or provides a haven for fleeing
terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   After months of tentative, post-Sept. 11 cooperation, Bush's sharp
words raised questions about the future of what many U.S. officials had
hoped was a budding relationship between the two countries.</LD>
<LD>   Bush commented amid intelligence reports that some Osama bin Laden
loyalists had crossed over Afghanistan's 600-mile border with Iran. U.S.
officials also have become concerned about attempts by Iran to extend its
political and military influence into western Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   Bush made it clear that the U.S. is prepared to respond with more than
rhetoric. He said that if Iranian officials "in any way, shape or form
try to destabilize the [Afghan] government," the United States and its
anti-Taliban allies will "deal with them . . . in diplomatic
ways--initially."</TE>
<TE>   "Iran must be a contributor in the war against terror," the president
said. "Our nation and our fight against terror will uphold the doctrine:
Either you're with us or against us."</TE>
<TE>   An administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity
conceded that the United States is unclear on exactly what role the
government in Tehran may be playing.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush's comments also came at a time when Iran is being linked to a
boat loaded with 50 tons of weapons seized by Israel in the Red Sea on
Jan. 3. U.S. officials believe the arms were bound for Palestinians in
the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   In a briefing for U.S. officials in Washington on Wednesday, a top
Israeli security official charged that senior Iranian government
officials were directly involved in providing the arms.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon,
Iran cooperated with the U.S. in its war on terrorism. It pledged, for
instance, to help with search-and-rescue missions if pilots were lost.</TE>
<TE>   Iranian diplomats also backed U.S. and U.N. efforts to build an
alternative regime in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, U.S. officials have expressed hope that the Afghan
crisis might provide common ground for the U.S. and Iran to improve
relations, and Bush suggested as much Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "We had some positive signals early in this war from the Iranians. We
would hope that they would continue to be a positive force in helping us
bring people to justice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We would hope, for example, they wouldn't allow Al Qaeda murderers to
hide in their country," Bush said. "We would hope that if . . . someone
tries to flee into Iran, that they would hand them over to us."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. analysts doubt that the government of Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami is knowingly harboring either Taliban or Al Qaeda troops. Iran
was one of three main backers--with India and Russia--of Afghanistan's
Northern Alliance during its five-year campaign against the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unlikely that Iran would do anything to help the Taliban, given
the animosity before Sept. 11," said Shaul Bakhash, author of "The Reign
of the Ayatollahs" and an expert on Iran at George Mason University in
Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, Iran has very legitimate reasons for a presence or interest
there with the new government," Bakhash said. "It has a long border, and
any instability in Afghanistan affects Iranian interests." There's also a
huge Afghan refugee population, which Iran would like to see go home."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Afghanistan has a Shiite Muslim minority also creates a
bond between the two countries. Iran, an overwhelmingly Shiite country,
feels an obligation to look after the interests of Afghanistan's Shiites,
who were often victimized by the Sunni Muslim Taliban. The new leadership
in Kabul also is predominantly Sunni.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say that for all of Iran's initial support of the U.S.-led
efforts in Afghanistan, Tehran also has reasons for being leery.</TE>
<TE>   "Iran is concerned about an American military presence in Afghanistan,
right on its borders . . . plus the already sizable U.S. military
presence in the Persian Gulf and increasingly in Central Asia," said

<TE>   The United States has tried to balance the concerns of all of
Afghanistan's six neighbors and prevent any one of them from wielding a

<HD>Security Planners Building Fortress Utah for Olympics</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Official says safety expenditures will be nearly triple
that for Atlanta Summer Games.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The federal government expressed confidence Thursday in the safety
of the Winter Olympics as authorities continued to heavily fortify Salt
Lake City to protect against the possibility of terrorist attack.</LD>
<LD>   Government agencies are spending about $300 million for security and
safety during next month's Games. The money will pay for F-16 fighter
jets in the skies and thousands of National Guard troops on the streets.
It will be used to beef up patrols at the sporting events, build fences
around the Olympic Village at the University of Utah, and operate metal
detectors and other screening devices at every entrance and exit.</LD>
<LD>   Federal officials Thursday said they were confident that two years of
planning, along with additional scrutiny after the September attacks,
would keep the 17-day event, which begins Feb. 8, trouble free.</LD>
<TE>   "I believe one of the safest places on the globe from the beginning to
the end of February will be Salt Lake City," said Homeland Security
Director Thomas J. Ridge after touring the security network in Salt Lake
City and meeting with Olympic security officials Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   But he also cautioned that, even with all of the planning and the work
of 60 different federal, state and local agencies, "there's no guarantee
it is a fail-safe system."</TE>
<TE>   He added that the large security expenditure, nearly three times the
amount spent for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, is well worth it.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no specific information about the Olympics being a target,"
he said. "But the fact is it's an international stage where the world
will be watching."</TE>
<TE>   The White House was equally confident.</TE>
<TE>   "We are well prepared for any contingency," the Bush administration
said in a statement released here by Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   "We have applied the lessons learned from the terrorist attacks at the
1972 Munich Summer Olympics and the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics,"
Fleischer said. "Following the attacks of Sept. 11, a thorough
reevaluation was performed to close any gaps that remain. Air security
was stepped up, entrance to venues made more stringent and some
non-competition sites made more secure.</TE>
<TE>   While the heightened safety measures and other precautions are
designed to wrap the city and slopes in a tight security net, officials
hope it does not intrude on the spirit of the Games and the activities of
athletes and spectators.</TE>
<TE>   Mitt Romney, president of the organizing committee, said in a recent
interview that "compared to Atlanta it's a huge step forward" in
security.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, about $110 million was spent on safety in Atlanta, and there
was no single security team leader. A bomb was detonated during a
late-night gathering, killing one woman was injuring 100 people.
Survivalist Eric Robert Rudolph, named as the prime suspect in the
bombing, was never captured.</TE>
<TE>   This year, with the government contributing an added $55 million after
Sept. 11, security is being headed up by the Secret Service. That is
because after Atlanta, then-President Clinton ordered that security be
coordinated and supervised under one agency for major public events such
as the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   But if there is a terrorist attack, officials said, the FBI would
investigate the matter and the Federal Emergency Management Agency would
be brought in to help with the aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   "We will have more military personnel and law enforcement at the
Games," Romney said. But the intention, he has said on many occasions, is
not to create "an armed camp."</TE>
<TE>   There are 20 separate venues in Salt Lake City for the various
contests, spread out over a 6,000-square-mile area, and all will be
watched over by about 10,000 security personnel.</TE>
<TE>   The skies over the region will be heavily patrolled by military jets
from a fighter wing at nearby Hill Air Force Base.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Aviation Administration has instituted a no-fly zone,
nicknamed the Olympic Ring, to cover a 45-mile radius extending from Salt
Lake International Airport. Non-military flights will not be allowed in
the ring during the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games, which
end Feb. 24. Also, an array of flights, from hot-air balloons to crop
dusters and gliders, will not be permitted there during the Games.</TE>
<TE>   The Utah Olympic Public Safety Command announced additional airspace
restrictions Thursday that include a 24-hour ban on anything other than
emergency service aircraft over nine Olympic venues for the duration of
the Games. The edict is meant to affect private aircraft mainly, with
commercial flights able to fly above the 18,000-foot restricted ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   During the Olympics, only commercial and cargo flights will be allowed
to land in Salt Lake City. Other air traffic bound for Salt Lake City
will be required to land first at nearby "gateway airports," where
security checks and inspections will be conducted.</TE>
<TE>   On the ground, extraordinary measures have been taken to secure the
mountainous, wide-open terrain where many of the events will take place.
Rangers from the National Park Service, trained in mountaineering and
survival skills, will patrol the slopes at the alpine ski events. Secret
Service agents will man snowmobiles.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors will be subjected to state-of-the-art security technology,
both at the Olympic venues and within a seven-block downtown area called
Olympic Square.</TE>
<TE>   Monitoring nearly everything will be hundreds of surveillance cameras,
some able to scan an Olympic identification badge from 1,000 feet away.</TE>
<TE>   The call-up of 2,100 National Guard soldiers by Gov. Mike Leavitt is
the largest in Utah history. And, in light of the anthrax threats, almost
all mail to the athletes' village will be restricted. Authorities also
are stockpiling medical supplies, such as antibiotics and vaccines.</TE>
<TE>   "What people will find is a very appropriate security presence," said
Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson. "It's not going to be oppressive or
overwhelming, but it will be conspicuous in a sense that most people
would expect or even desire."</TE>
<TE>   How will he know if the Games were successful? "First and foremost, if
they were safe," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Camillo, Olympics coordinator for the Secret Service, said he
hopes that the enhanced security is not intrusive.</TE>
<TE>   "The Secret Service is one agency that hangs its hat on security that
is discreet," Camillo said. "There will be a visual presence because of
magnetometers and fencing. What you won't see is what I'll describe as a
police state."</TE>

<HD>Nations Propose to Fight Terror</HD>
<DH>U.N.: Most have complied with a demand that they submit their plans
to the Security Council. The reports are to stay private.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>Most governments have complied with a Security Council demand for
reports on their plans to combat terrorism, but it will be months before
the documents are thoroughly reviewed and the council's responses will be
kept confidential, the British diplomat overseeing the process said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Security Council has received 117 of the reports requested from
the 189 U.N. member states. At least 40 more countries have indicated
they will respond soon, said Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's ambassador to
the U.N. and chairman of the Security Council's newly created
counter-terror committee.</LD>
<LD>   The response represents "an extremely good start by the historical
standards of the U.N.," Greenstock said.</LD>
<TE>   Under terms of the Sept. 28 Security Council resolution calling for
the reports, member states were required to respond within 90 days, a
deadline that passed two weeks ago. But there are no penalties for
noncompliance, though Greenstock said the council "will chase up"
delinquents.</TE>
<TE>   "There will probably be a minority of member states that will need
some persuasion," he said.</TE>
<TE>   What form that persuasion might take has not yet been made clear, as
few of the council's communications will be public. It also isn't clear
whether the U.N. has enough money to bankroll an ambitious Security
Council plan to tighten the noose around global terrorist networks.</TE>
<TE>   Countries have been asked to provide detailed explanations of their
legal controls on fund-raising for terrorist organizations, as well as
limitations on the freedom of movement and action of suspected
terrorists. Members have also been invited to seek technical assistance
in drafting legislation or instituting other measures requested by the
council.</TE>
<TE>   "What's clear to us so far is that a lot of members who want to comply
are going to need a lot of help, and it is going to take a lot of time
and money," said a diplomat on one country's delegation to the Security
Council, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Greenstock would not comment Thursday on the substance of the replies
received to date.</TE>
<TE>   But he acknowledged that the council's work is hampered by the U.N.'s
inability to agree on a definition of terrorism. Many members exclude
from that category groups that they consider national liberation
movements, among them Palestinian factions fighting against Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Greenstock said most, but not all, council members were ready to
embrace a blanket rejection of "the indiscriminate killing of civilians,"
no matter what the cause.</TE>
<TE>   No countries so far have openly refused to cooperate, council
officials say. Some of the first responses came from countries that have
been accused by the United States and others of harboring or supporting
terrorists, including Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Syria, a newly elected member of the Security Council, is on the
counter-terror committee, which is officially composed of all 15 Security
Council members.</TE>
<TE>   To review the reports, the committee has contracted six outside
experts, ranging from a Peruvian police commander who helped imprison
leaders of the Shining Path movement to an Indian treasury official who
tracks international money-laundering schemes. The analysis, which will
be distributed privately to the 15 council members, is expected to take
at least three months, U.N. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging criticism from human rights groups that hard-line
regimes may use the counter-terror campaign to justify internal
repression, Greenstock said the committee plans to have human rights
specialists review the submitted documents. But he stressed that the
committee's mandate is to combat terrorism, not pass judgment on domestic
political practices.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a trade-off between security and civil liberties,"
Greenstock said.</TE>

<HD>20 Terror Prisoners on Way to Cuba</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Rights group denounces U.S. military's treatment of
the captives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A U.S. military cargo plane left Afghanistan on Thursday with the
first group of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to be transferred to
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as human rights activists criticized their
treatment, citing hooded and possibly drugged detainees being sent to
"cage-like cells."</LD>
<LD>   Pentagon officials made no apologies for the security precautions
being taken with the 20 prisoners, whose ranks have sometimes killed
their captors and themselves with grenades strapped to their bodies.</LD>
<LD>   The Cuba-bound prisoners were chained to their seats inside the
cavernous C-17 military plane and were required to use bedpan-like
portable toilets during a flight from the southern Afghan city of
Kandahar that would take about 18 hours.</LD>
<TE>   The human rights group Amnesty International issued a statement
calling reports of the detainees' treatment "worrying" and their sedation
a "breach of international standards."</TE>
<TE>   But Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said the commanders
overseeing the detainees had carefully studied a prison uprising in the
northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif, during which a CIA agent and
Afghan forces were killed, and a shootout in which suspected Al Qaeda
fighters revolted and killed the Pakistani soldiers who had imprisoned
them after they crossed the border.</TE>
<TE>   "[The commanders] were all aware that . . . there are among these
prisoners people who are perfectly willing to kill themselves and kill
other people," Rumsfeld said in a Pentagon briefing. "So I hope that they
use the appropriate restraint, and that's what I suspect they will be
doing."</TE>
<TE>   Security became an issue within five minutes of the plane's departure
at 8:20 a.m. PST, when gunshots erupted near the runway. No Marines were
hit, but they returned the fire, said Cmdr. Dan Kesee, a spokesman for
the Tampa, Fla.-based U.S. Central Command, which is directing the war.
Afghan forces and Marines launched a search for the gunmen, but none were
found.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials wouldn't comment on reports that the prisoners were
sedated, saying they didn't want to disclose their methods to future
prisoners. But at Guantanamo, the troops preparing to receive the
prisoners have been practicing techniques to handcuff and sedate them.
According to Amnesty International, the United Nations' Principles of
Medical Ethics declares that drugs should be used only for medical
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon spokesman Jay Steuck said that under the Geneva Conventions,
human rights groups can request to be walked through the procedure the
military is following with the prisoners. Because the prisoners did not
wear uniforms in a recognized army, the Pentagon contends, the Geneva
rules do not apply but are being adhered to anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Security remains the foremost concern for the soldiers of the U.S.
Southern Command who are transporting the prisoners to Cuba, Capt. Tom
Crosson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Every step has been practiced and rehearsed," he said. "There's a
large amount of security presence on the aircraft. Out of concern for the
safety of the air crew and the staff of the plane, their goal is to get
everyone from Kandahar to Cuba safely."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Amnesty International officials expressed concern
at photos showing detainees in Afghanistan hooded while under guard by
U.S. Marines, saying hoods may violate international standards
prohibiting "cruel, inhuman or degrading" treatment.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the group also said the 6-foot-square chain-link cells
surrounded by razor and concertina wire at Guantanamo may "fall below
minimum standards for human treatment." The cage size falls below U.S.
prison standards, the group said. The general overseeing the Guantanamo
prison said conditions will improve.</TE>
<TE>   "The next phase [of detention facilities] is going to be much better,
but when you have 10 days or less to put something together, it's not
going to be the Hilton," Marine Brig. Gen. Michael Lehnert said
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan forces holding thousands of prisoners have transferred 371
detainees into U.S. custody, including the 20 headed toward Guantanamo
and those remaining at the Marine prison in Kandahar and at Bagram air
base north of Kabul, the capital. All of the prisoners aboard the
amphibious assault ship Bataan in the Arabian Sea were moved to other
facilities except for American Talib John Walker Lindh, who remains
aboard the ship.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, before signing a defense spending bill in a Pentagon
ceremony, President Bush praised the armed forces for their work in
defeating the Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters in custody. Before the Sept.
11 terror attacks, he said, "they thought we were soft." Leaning across
the podium with a smile, he added, "I don't think they think that way
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   As the president signed what he called "a down payment" on future
security, U.S. Special Forces troops were expanding their anti-terrorism
role in the Philippines. About two dozen troops are doing logistical and
security planning for a larger force that could arrive within a week, a
defense official told Associated Press on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   In the capital, Manila, Philippine military spokesman Brig. Gen.
Edilberto Adan said Wednesday that small groups of U.S. troops,
eventually totaling more than 100, would soon start arriving. Asked about
the apparent buildup, Rumsfeld said U.S. troops there had been sent to
aid the local military in its hunt for terrorists who have kidnapped
hostages, including at least two Americans.</TE>

<LD>Town officials in Mooresville, Ind., have shot down a proposal to
hold a festival in honor of bank robber and native son John Dillinger.</LD>
<LD>   Town council members said the idea for "Dillinger Days," put forth by

the outlaw.</LD>
<LD>   "He was a criminal bum, and he's dead, so let him stay that way," said
council member Toby Dolen.</LD>
<TE>   Dillinger, once dubbed Public Enemy No. 1, was the most notorious bank

<HD>'Gentle Giant' Awaits Fate in Hockey Death</HD>
<DH>Courts: The attorneys make closing arguments in the manslaughter
trial of a player's father. Now the jury has the case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
</DL>
<LD>He was a "gentle giant" who was just trying to protect himself,
defense attorney Thomas Orlandi Jr. said Thursday in closing arguments in
the manslaughter trial of Thomas Junta, a hockey father accused of
beating another sports dad to death.</LD>
<LD>   "Gentle giant?" prosecutor Sheila Calkins retorted, barely reining in
her disdain when she took her turn at summation. Acting out both sides of
the fight before a highly attentive jury, she stated: "He took [Michael
Costin's] head and he slammed it into the mat. The 'gentle giant.' "</LD>
<LD>   Jurors were sent to deliberate just after noon Thursday in a
nationally televised trial that has come to symbolize the dangers of
excessive parental involvement in youth sports.</LD>
<TE>   Junta, 44, is accused of manslaughter in the July 5, 2000, death of
40-year-old Costin following a practice game that included both of their
sons. In instructions from Superior Court Judge Charles Grabau, jurors
learned Thursday that they may consider both voluntary and involuntary
manslaughter charges.</TE>
<TE>   The maximum sentence for either charge is 20 years in prison. But with
sentencing guidelines set by the state Legislature, a first voluntary
manslaughter offense usually carries a prison sentence of eight to 12
years. For involuntary manslaughter, a first offender in Massachusetts
normally receives three to five years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Grabau spent nearly an hour detailing the intricacies of the two types
of manslaughter for the jury. The distinctions, centering on intent, were
confusing enough that by late Thursday the jury of nine women and three
men asked the judge for clarification.</TE>
<TE>   Orlandi said he was concerned that the inclusion of involuntary
manslaughter offers a chance for jurors to compromise.</TE>
<TE>   "It scares me," he said. "It's a fallback position."</TE>
<TE>   The courtroom was filled for closing arguments in the weeklong trial.
The defendant's wife, mother and two children took front-row seats, as
close to Junta as possible. They were surrounded by Junta's six brothers
and five sisters, along with spouses and other supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Costin's family, escorted by a court-appointed victims' advocate, left
before jury instructions were administered.</TE>
<TE>   The jury must sift through nearly 100 articles of evidence and
conflicting stories about what happened when Junta, a 275-pound truck
driver, and Costin, a carpenter who weighed 156 pounds, fought at Burbank
Ice Arena in Reading, just north of Boston.</TE>
<TE>   No one disputes that the argument began at a children's pickup hockey
game, with the sons of both men on opposing teams. Costin was skating
with the boys and Junta was watching. When the play turned rough, Junta
walked onto the ice to challenge Costin.</TE>
<TE>   The men traded barbs and vulgarities. After the buzzer sounded to end
the game, the pair began to scuffle in the locker room. A college-age
hockey player separated the combatants, and Junta left.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, Junta returned. Outside the locker room, in an area
near the skating rink, they resumed their fistfight in the final, fatal
round.</TE>
<TE>   Junta testified that Costin lunged at him and grabbed Junta's wrist as
the two men fell to the ground. Junta said he left the arena thinking
that Costin was "just resting" and insisted he delivered only three blows
to Costin's head.</TE>
<TE>   One of at least half a dozen children who were eyewitnesses, Quinlan
Junta, the defendant's 12-year-old son, supported his father's story in
testimony.</TE>
<TE>   But a rink manager, Nancy Blanchard, said she saw Junta hit Costin at
least six to 10 times. Prosecutor Calkins also introduced a photograph
showing a bruise Blanchard said she received on her arm after Junta
pushed her aside.</TE>
<TE>   In his summation, Orlandi stressed that the encounter was "simply a
fight." His client was attacked, he said.</TE>
<TE>   During closing arguments, Junta spent much of the time staring down,
often clutching a tissue and occasionally dabbing at his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Orlandi conceded that the outcome was tragic--so much so that
"everyone loses in this tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   But, he told jurors, "please don't let the tragedy impact on the facts
of this case. . . . Send Tom Junta back to his hockey family and stop
what's been going on here."</TE>
<TE>   Calkins rejoined that "tears come very easily, ladies and gentlemen,
at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone in the courtroom has sympathy for both sides, she went on.
And, she said, listening to a 12-year-old testify in his father's
manslaughter trial is painful.</TE>
<TE>   But, reminding jurors to leave their sympathies at the courtroom door,
she concluded, "It's also really hard to think of Michael Costin's
children without a dad. But that's the reason that you were picked as
jurors."</TE>

<HD>Teacher Who Fled Myanmar Wins Asylum</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GETTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Sometime this weekend, Tialhei Zathang, a math teacher who fled
persecution in Myanmar for protection in the United States, will tell his
family the words they have waited more than three years to hear: "We are
free."</LD>
<LD>   Zathang's tortuous journey through America's immigration courts ended
Monday, 1,130 days after it started, when the Board of Immigration
Appeals reversed an immigration judge's earlier decision and granted him
political asylum.</LD>
<LD>   "I am very, very happy," Zathang said Thursday. "I feel very, very,
very good right now."</LD>
<TE>   The decision means he will finally be able to start the paperwork to
bring his wife and three children--now 7, 8 and 17--to the United States.
They have been in hiding in India since the family fled the Burmese
military in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Zathang claimed he had been persecuted in Myanmar, the Southeast Asian
nation formerly known as Burma, where human rights abuses are rampant. He
had been imprisoned and beaten as a practicing Christian in a Buddhist
country who fought for democracy. Myanmar has been under military rule
since 1962.</TE>
<TE>   His asylum case was featured in a Times article last spring as a
window into the problems plaguing U.S. Immigration Court, where justice
can be arbitrary.</TE>
<TE>   Although Congress defines the mission of the courts as the
"expeditious, fair and proper resolution of matters coming before
immigration judges," in reality the courts are backlogged. It is
difficult to find competent translators. Judges have enormous discretion
to interpret the law, so that decisions often turn on who the judge is,
not the facts of the case.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration Judge Joan V. Churchill presided over Zathang's asylum
hearing in the summer of 1999. Churchill is the toughest judge in the
Washington area, granting asylum in about 10% of her cases. The national
average is about 14%.</TE>
<TE>   Zathang said he and his family fled Myanmar in the middle of the night
on Feb. 27, 1998, after the wife of the village leader warned him he was
about to be arrested. The journey to India took 16 grueling days. But
Indian authorities had begun deporting illegal immigrants back to
Myanmar, so the family went into hiding.</TE>
<TE>   Zathang said he purchased an Indian passport on the black market and
used it to get to the United States, where he sought asylum.</TE>
<TE>   His court case bogged down from the start. It took four different
court dates over three months before his hearing was completed.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration and Naturalization Service lawyers argued that Zathang was
not Burmese at all. They claimed he was Indian, citing as proof the
Indian passport he had used to enter the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Most asylum applicants have little evidence to back up their stories.
But Zathang's case was unusually strong.</TE>
<TE>   A University of Illinois anthropology and linguistics professor
testified that he knew Zathang in Myanmar and that Zathang spoke a
dialect found only in the Chin state that he claimed as home. One of
Zathang's cousins, who had been granted asylum himself, testified that he
too purchased an Indian passport. An exiled member of the Burmese
Parliament, who said he had known Zathang for 20 years, verified his
story.</TE>
<TE>   And an Indian newspaper article described Zathang's flight from
Myanmar and said the police were "seeking him for interrogation."</TE>
<TE>   It took Churchill 13 months to issue her decision, even though
immigration judges are supposed to rule within 60 days after a hearing
ends. She rejected Zathang's claim, deciding that he had Indian
nationality. She said he could possibly have Burmese nationality as well,
but since he had lived safely in India before coming to America, he did
not qualify for asylum.</TE>
<TE>   His lawyers appealed.</TE>
<TE>   Zathang has been living with friends and relatives in Maryland and
Indiana since then.</TE>
<TE>   In May, after the Times article appeared, the immigration appeals
board sent the case back to Churchill, asking her to review the tapes of
the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The board said it could not finish reviewing the case because it found
some of the tape-recordings to be inaudible. The only record of an
immigration court hearing is a tape-recording kept by the judge.</TE>
<TE>   Churchill reviewed the transcript and sent the board an addition to
her earlier ruling. She stood by her earlier decision and said she found
it "quite preposterous" that Zathang, his wife and children had time to
flee their village in Myanmar while the military was in pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   Zathang's lawyers, meanwhile, submitted additional evidence to the INS
that showed dual citizenship between India and Myanmar did not exist.</TE>
<TE>   INS attorneys in Washington finally conceded that Zathang was indeed
from Myanmar.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 28, INS and Zathang's lawyers submitted a joint motion to the
appeals board that urged he be granted asylum.</TE>
<TE>   The board ruled to grant the motion. Immigration judges are banned
from talking about their decisions. A court spokesman said Churchill
would not comment on the outcome of the appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the article had a big impact," said an elated Jessica Attie,
who represented Zathang while a student at Georgetown University Law
School. "Unfortunately, not every case gets its own article."</TE>
<TE>   Zathang, 42, has been working 12-hour shifts at a factory in
Indianapolis, where he is living with five other Burmese refugees. His
long days and the time difference have made it tough for him to reach his
wife. He hopes to call her this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "I got asylum," he said he will say. "Don't worry about me or you or
the children. We are free."</TE>

<HD>It's Just Hip When a Congressman Is Asked to Strip</HD>
<DH>Security: When his artificial joint sets off an airport metal
detector, Rep. Dingell is ordered to drop his pants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>He is an unlikely topic of hot gossip, a 75-year-old congressman
who looks like a drill sergeant and argues fiercely for issues like
telephone deregulation.</LD>
<LD>   But John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), the longest-serving member of the House
of Representatives, whose intimidating tactics have earned him the
nickname Big John, has become an item of curiosity with a small gesture
that has made him the talk of Washington and beyond.</LD>
<LD>   He stripped.</LD>
<TE>   When his hip replacement pin set off a metal detector at Reagan
National Airport last weekend, screeners asked him to drop his pants. The
ranking Democrat on the Commerce Committee, who travels to his home
district in Detroit frequently, went into a private room and showed his
boxers.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since, Dingell has been doling out sound bites ("They felt me up
and down like a prize steer," he told the Detroit News, which broke the
story Monday), while his staff fields a surprising number of phone calls
and e-mails from around the country. One response came from the doctor
who implanted the hip after Dingell was in a hunting accident 20 years
ago. He offered to send a note of verification.</TE>
<TE>   "Who would have thought I would be answering so many questions about
the congressman's underwear?" marveled Michael Hacker, Dingell's press
secretary.</TE>
<TE>   But aside from the water cooler jokes ("Now he knows how the taxpayers
feel at tax time!" a Warren, Mich., man wrote in a chat-room message at
the Detroit News' Web site), the Dingell incident has set off more than
the metal detector. Something of a national debate about airport security
seems to have developed.</TE>
<TE>   To some, the incident is reassuring. Throughout the encounter, Dingell
never disclosed that he was a congressman, although he did refuse to
place his wallet on the conveyor belt. He insisted that his wife
Debbie--president of General Motors' charity, the GM Foundation--had
jewelry stolen from her purse in an earlier airport encounter.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was great that he had to endure what the common man would
have had to endure," Will Sanders of Santa Monica wrote at the Detroit
News' Web site. He said security employees "did their job."</TE>
<TE>   Northwest Airlines agreed, saying its employee handled the incident in
"a dignified and professional manner."</TE>
<TE>   Others see the incident as security run amok, a sure sign that the
terrorists are winning by frightening the United States into giving up
its freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   "This is getting to be a bit ridiculous," wrote a Wales, Mass.,
reader. "No one has to endure a strip search to board a train or a bus. .
. . Enough already!"</TE>
<TE>   But to those who know Dingell well--including the fellow politicians
and special-interest lobbyists who have cowered under his glare for
years--the most remarkable thing about the incident was Dingell's
compliance.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want any special treatment," he reportedly told
Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta, who called to apologize. "I
don't want to be treated any better than anyone else, but I don't want to
be treated any worse either."</TE>
<TE>   Dingell's deference may have something to do with the fact that this
is an election year. For the first time since he arrived in Washington in
1955, Dingell is facing a competitive, redistricted race against another
incumbent Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, by week's end, Dingell appeared to have tired of the
topic and was eager to return to more comfortable subjects, like the
patients' bill of rights (he's for it) and gun control (he's against it).</TE>
<TE>   Explained one aide: "Congressman Dingell just doesn't feel like
talking about his underwear anymore."</TE>

<HD>Ashcroft Recuses Himself From Probe Into Fallen Energy Giant</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Enron's vast connections in D.C. and Texas have
created an obstacle to the Justice Department's inquiry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Enron's many financial and political ties to the Bush
administration and other government officials are already complicating a
nascent criminal probe by the Justice Department into the bankrupt energy
company.</LD>
<LD>   And Enron's entrenched network of connections at the White House and
on Capitol Hill--forged by political contributions, lobbying and personal
ties--are making it difficult for politicians to keep at arm's length the
growing furor engulfing the company.</LD>
<LD>   The most obvious example is Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's announcement
Thursday that he and his chief of staff, David Ayres, are recusing
themselves--removing themselves from any involvement in what will surely
be one of the Justice Department's highest-profile criminal
investigations of the year.</LD>
<TE>   The reason: Ashcroft and Ayres didn't want anyone to think that
they--or the Justice Department--would go easy on Enron because the
company's chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, other Enron employees and the
company's political action committee had contributed more than $57,000 in
2000 to Ashcroft's failed senatorial campaign, which Ayres managed.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft insisted that he has not been involved in any aspect of the
Enron investigation. He said his deputy, Larry Thompson, would take his
place if and when high-level consultations are needed.</TE>
<TE>   In Houston, Enron's hometown, U.S. Atty. Michael T. Shelby recused not
only himself Thursday but also his entire office of federal prosecutors,
who were expected to play a prominent role in the criminal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In Shelby's case, the recusals came for the opposite reason: Too many
prosecutors--himself included--had friends and family members who had
worked for Enron and had suffered numbing financial losses when its stock
price plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   "We might be viewed as being overly aggressive because we know people,
and in some cases are married to people, who lost substantial amounts of
money as a result of the collapse of the company," Shelby said in an
interview. "In my case, it's my wife's brother who works there."</TE>
<TE>   Whether they fear being perceived as going too easy or too hard on
Enron, the prosecutors' ties to the company could well hamper the
investigation in its early stages, some Justice Department officials and
outside legal experts said Thursday. Because of the likelihood of
conflicts in the Houston office, the Justice Department this week
convened a task force out of its Washington headquarters in an effort to
determine whether any laws were broken as the company collapsed late last
year, shredding billions of investor dollars and costing thousands of
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "This investigation needs to go forward, and it needs to go forward in
an expeditious and focused way," Shelby said. "And there needs to be a
seamless transition between this office and the Department of Justice."</TE>
<TE>   Enron has long sought to be influential in Texas and Washington, and
it has succeeded through political contributions to both parties,
extensive lobbying and personal ties.</TE>
<TE>   Although few, if any, elected officials have said they will recuse
themselves from the congressional investigations into the Enron collapse,
many have connections to the company.</TE>
<TE>   The most obvious example is Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, the senior
Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, which is investigating the
Enron matter. Gramm's wife, Wendy, has served on Enron's board of
directors.</TE>
<TE>   And Enron has deep links to President Bush and others in his
administration.</TE>
<TE>   It was disclosed Thursday that Lay called two Cabinet members,
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans, late
last year to discuss the company's financial problems. O'Neill, through a
spokeswoman, acknowledged being an acquaintance of Lay's. Evans, a former
oil company executive, has long-standing connections to the Texas
political and business worlds as well.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Enron's political action committee and the company's
employees and directors contributed a total of $5.7 million to candidates
and the two political parties--73% of that to Republicans--in the last
seven election cycles, according to an analysis conducted by the Center
for Responsive Politics. Bush received $113,800 for his presidential
campaign, Gramm received $97,350, and Texas' other Republican senator,
Kay Bailey Hutchison, received $99,500.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's employees and directors have given $623,000 to Bush during his
political career, according to the Center for Public Integrity.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's chief economic advisor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, served on an Enron
advisory board and, according to documents the White House made public
last year, received $50,000 from the company before he joined the
administration a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Rove, Bush's senior advisor, delayed selling his significant
portfolio of Enron stock for several months after taking office, to avoid
having to pay capital gains taxes on his profits, and met with Lay while
holding the stock.</TE>
<TE>   Former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot, soon to become chairman of the
Republican National Committee, was recently a lobbyist for Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats plan to take up the issue of the Bush administration's
connections to Enron as the various investigations progress.</TE>
<TE>   "The White House has to do a complete disclosure of all the contacts
administration representatives had with Enron," said Phil Schilero, chief
of staff to Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles).</TE>

<HD>Destruction of Records 'Unusual,' Experts Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The disclosure Thursday by Andersen, the accounting firm, that it
destroyed a "significant" number of documents of client Enron Corp. in
recent months came as a surprise to the accounting industry, which
typically keeps such records for years even though there aren't strict
rules regulating an auditor's paperwork storage.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson's action "is unusual," said Jonathan Hamilton, editor of the
Public Accounting Report, a trade publication. "Usually in the case of an
ongoing client relationship, you find it useful" to keep nearly all
documents, he said.</LD>
<LD>   And if there's even a hint that the accounting firm or its client
might be involved in litigation down the road, "the general rule is that
you keep everything," Hamilton said.</LD>
<TE>   In November, Houston-based Enron said it had inflated profits by $586
million since 1997. The energy company is operating under bankruptcy
court protection and is under criminal investigation by the Justice
Department, an inquiry expected to focus on possible accounting fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The company also is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and several congressional committees.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC's director of enforcement, Stephen Cutler, said in a statement
that the destruction of Enron-related documents and electronic files by
Andersen, formerly known as Arthur Andersen, are "an extremely serious
matter" because documents "are an essential ingredient in our
investigations."</TE>
<TE>   But he didn't say whether Andersen's action was illegal, and the SEC
declined further comment. Andersen said it still has "millions of
documents related to Enron" but that its policy for record storage--a
policy that Andersen said it has now suspended--required that some
documents be destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which issues guidelines for
how accounting firms should audit a company's books, doesn't offer set
rules for saving documents, said spokeswoman Sheryl Thompson. Another
trade group, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,
recommends that accounting firms keep documents for as long as they serve
the needs of the firm.</TE>
<TE>   But that guideline is open to broad interpretation, and the storage of
documents varies from firm to firm.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, most accounting firms keep their audit records for at least
three to four years, Arthur Bowman, editor of the industry newsletter
Bowman's Accounting Report, told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   None of the other big accounting firms could immediately be reached
for comment, but industry insiders said some firms have a standard
practice of keeping records for a minimum of six years.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton said it's not the first time that an accounting firm has
raised questions by destroying corporate documents.</TE>
<TE>   "It's come up from time to time in the profession, especially when we
had the dot-com shakeout," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The collapse of many high-technology companies sparked shareholder
lawsuits that led to accounting firms saying they had destroyed the
auditing documents in certain cases "because they're not our client
anymore," Hamilton added.</TE>

<HD>Davis Budget Balanced on Hope</HD>
<DH>Spending: The governor's plan relies on borrowing $5 billion and
getting $1 billion from the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis, confronted with a $12.5-billion deficit and a
tough reelection campaign, has produced a budget balanced largely on
begging, borrowing and hope.</LD>
<LD>   The spending plan that Davis proposed Thursday trims $5.2 billion from
a variety of programs without imposing politically unpopular tax hikes or
cutting education and public safety, his avowed top priorities.</LD>
<LD>   But he's also used a variety of accounting maneuvers and questionable
assumptions.</LD>
<TE>   Among other things, Davis is turning to the Bush administration and
Congress, asking that Washington provide California with more than $1
billion in aid--an iffy proposition. Davis also is proposing to borrow an
additional $5 billion. Finally, he hopes that California's economy
rebounds by midyear. When more people are working and paying taxes, state
coffers will once again fill.</TE>
<TE>   He also hopes that his administration and Treasurer Phil Angelides
will be able to reach an agreement with the California Public Utilities
Commission to sell bonds to repay state coffers for the $6 billion it
spent last year buying electricity on behalf of the state's ailing
utilities. If those bonds are not sold by the end of June--and Angelides
and other experts say time is running short--the state could have an
additional $6-billion hole in its budget.</TE>
<TE>   Budget analysts were skeptical of Davis' budget strategy and
assumptions about the economy, as were Republican and Democratic
legislators.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very risky proposal that he's put forward," said state Sen.
Chuck Poochigian (R-Fresno). "It is based on a gamble. It's based on a
bet that things will get better."</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers are sure to change the spending plan between now and the
July 1 deadline for having a budget in place. But if the Legislature were
to approve the plan for the 2002-2003 fiscal year as Davis proposes,
California, which only two years ago had historic surpluses, will be
operating at a deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Davis assumes that general taxes--mainly those levied on personal
income, sales, and bank and corporate profits--will generate $74.4
billion in the new fiscal year. However, Davis pegs general fund
spending, which represents most state programs, at $78.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, if you look at the budget and ongoing revenue and
expenditures, you do have an imbalance," said Brad Williams, economist
for the nonpartisan legislative analyst's office. "That raises a risk
about the out-years."</TE>
<TE>   Davis has long proclaimed that he is tight with taxpayers' dollars,
and he repeatedly has said he used the windfall of tax money that flowed
into Sacramento during his first years in office to pay for one-time
costs, like constructing buildings and freeway overpasses.</TE>
<TE>   In a report issued last month, however, the legislative analyst said
much of that money also was spent to expand state programs, costing
taxpayers more each year. The state general fund has jumped to $79
billion, from $39 billion at the end of the recession in the 1993-1994
fiscal year. About half that increase occurred during Davis' first two
years, the legislative analyst found.</TE>
<TE>   Without structural changes in state spending, the shortfall will
remain a problem for at least the next five years. If Davis wins
reelection, he will be confronted with a $7.5-billion deficit for fiscal
year 2003-2004, the legislative analyst found.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that the state's projected annual operating deficit does not
disappear over time indicates that the state cannot simply grow itself
out of its budget problem," the legislative analyst's report said.</TE>
<TE>   As he unveiled his proposal Thursday, Davis called it a responsible
budget that protects most state programs. But to do so, Davis is taking a
page from his Republican predecessor, Gov. Pete Wilson, who struggled
with a $14-billion deficit in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Like Wilson, Davis is turning to the federal government, asking that
it pay California $1 billion for what he contends should be federal
responsibilities, including additional terrorist-related security and
incarcerating illegal immigrants in California prisons.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson found that federal payments generally fell significantly short
of his requests. Asked about a possible fallback plan should the federal
government not come through, Davis said, "75% of what I'm proposing I
feel confident will be forthcoming."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to asking for federal aid, Davis is following a pattern
that became apparent during his handling of the energy crisis, when he
sought to ensure an adequate supply of electricity in part by signing
long-term contracts with independent power producers. Those contracts
require that consumers pay more than $40 billion spread over the next
decade.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Davis proposes that the state borrow to pay for part of this
year's $100-billion budget over time, with much of the bill coming due
years after Davis has left office.</TE>
<TE>   Since the start of Davis' tenure, California has received $500 million
a year as a result of the settlement of the nationwide tobacco
litigation. The state has used the bulk of the money to pay health care
for children of low-income parents and to boost state aid to the aged and
disabled. Lesser sums have been used to pay for breast and prostate
cancer treatment, and to combat smoking among children.</TE>
<TE>   Following the lead of other states, Davis wants to borrow against the
$500-million payments that are supposed to go on in perpetuity to secure
$2.4 billion to help solve this year's budget hole.</TE>
<TE>   To repay bond investors, Davis and future governors will be expected
to make annual payments of $190 million for the next 22
years--essentially lowering the tobacco settlement payments by 40% each
year, at a cost of almost $4.2 billion over the life of the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "It is certainly convenient for the short term," said Paul Knepprath
of the American Lung Assn. "But in the long term, we'll lose significant
dollars that could be used in health care and tobacco prevention."</TE>

<HD>El Nino Might Be Returning</HD>
<DH>Weather: A federal climate agency says one of the first signs, an
unusual warming in the Pacific Ocean, has begun.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The world may be headed for another bout with El Nino.</LD>
<LD>   The periodic event that can trigger changes in the weather worldwide
could return in early spring and affect the United States by late summer,
the federal Climate Prediction Center reported Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The severity of the effects depends on how strong the El Nino is, and
it's too early to predict that, said Vernon Kousky of the climate center,
a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</LD>
<TE>   A severe El Nino in 1997-98 caused flooding in California and along
the Gulf Coast.</TE>
<TE>   The first signs of an El Nino are an unusual warming of the water in
the tropical Pacific Ocean, something that has begun to occur, the agency
said. That can result in increases in rising warm air, changes in the air
pressure patterns and shifts in the high-level winds that direct the
movement of weather.</TE>
<TE>   The climate center said indications of the current warming include
increased cloudiness and rainfall over the equatorial central Pacific for
the first time since the last El Nino.</TE>
<TE>   "Considering the observed oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns
and their recent evolution, it seems most likely that warm-episode
conditions will develop in the tropical Pacific over the next three to
six months," Kousky said.</TE>
<TE>   The first area affected would be the tropical Pacific, he said, with
Indonesia likely to get some relief from torrential rains.</TE>
<TE>   If El Nino develops as expected, the Pacific Northwest will experience
wetter than normal conditions in the fall. In the winter, Louisiana
eastward to Florida, and possibly Southern California, could also
experience wetter than normal conditions, and the northern Great Plains
could experience warmer than normal conditions, Kousky said.</TE>
<TE>   El Ninos are associated with increased rainfall across the
east-central and eastern Pacific and with drier than normal conditions
over northern Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   During an El Nino, December to February will usually see
wetter-than-usual patterns along coastal Ecuador, northwestern Peru,
southern Brazil, central Argentina and equatorial eastern Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Drier-than-normal conditions are generally observed over northern
South America, Central America and southern Africa during this period.</TE>
<TE>   During June to August of an El Nino, it will be drier than normal over
eastern Australia and wetter than usual in the intermountain regions of
the United States and over central Chile.</TE>
<TE>   Temperatures during December to February of an El Nino year tend to be
abnormally high across Southeast Asia, southeastern Africa, Japan,
southern Alaska and western-central Canada, southeastern Brazil and
southeastern Australia.</TE>
<TE>   In June to August of an El Nino, it tends to be warmer than normal
along the west coast of South America and across southeastern Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   The causes of El Nino are not fully understood, but climate records
show the event has been occurring for hundreds of years.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, El Ninos have occurred every two to seven years and can
last up to 12 months. Sometimes an unusual cooling of the tropical
Pacific, called La Nina, occurs in between.</TE>
<TE>   El Nino means little boy in Spanish. The effect was named by Peruvian
fishermen who would notice its effect on their catch around Christmas and
called the phenomenon after the baby Jesus.</TE>

<LD>The National Zoo began a weeklong celebration Thursday of the first
anniversary of the arrival of its two pandas from China, with zoo
director Lucy Spelman saying it has been "a year of really productive
study."</LD>
<LD>   The zoo will host a day of family-oriented panda-related activities
Saturday. Next Tuesday and Wednesday nights, scientists who are studying
the panda will present their findings to the public. All events are free.</LD>
<LD>   The sun burst out from behind a cloud for a few minutes during
Thursday morning's news conference as the two animals were let out into
their yard, where sugar cane treats awaited them. The crowd rushed to the
fence to watch.</LD>
<TE>   The pandas--female Mei Xiang and male Tian Tian--are at the zoo on a
10-year loan. In return, the zoo raised $1 million a year for panda
preservation programs in China, where only about 1,000 of the endangered
animals are believed to remain in the wild.</TE>
<TE>   The animals--he is 257 pounds, she is 200 pounds--are healthy and have
adjusted well to their new digs, zoo officials say. Spelman said the
biggest surprise, to her, was "how active they are and how much they have
used all the features in the yard."</TE>

<HD>Schools Win Round in Land Battle</HD>
<DH>Court: judge rules L.A. Unified does not have to sell canyon
property to parks group and can offer it to other buyers.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District has won the latest round in
a battle over an eight-acre canyon property it owns in Brentwood.</LD>
<LD>   A Superior Court judge in Los Angeles ruled this week that the
district does not have to sell the property to a parks consortium that
last year bid $2 million for it. The decision allows the financially
troubled district to offer the Sullivan Canyon land to other possible
buyers for what its officials say could be as much as $17 million.</LD>
<LD>   The money from the sale could go toward constructing badly needed
schools elsewhere, said Patrick Perry, an attorney for the district.</LD>
<TE>   "They need to maximize their resources to the greatest extent
possible," he said. "The sale of the existing surplus property is one of
those resources."</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified purchased the land for $280,000 in 1961 as the site for a
proposed elementary school. The district no longer wants the Brentwood
land, now used for horse riding, because the public school student
population in that neighborhood is not growing much and many families
there send children to private schools.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1980s, the district has leased the property to the Sullivan
Canyon Riders Club, a group of equestrians, some of whom live in the
nearby affluent canyon area.</TE>
<TE>   But early last year, the district began efforts to sell the property.
After learning in November that its lease would not be renewed, the
140-member riding club joined in an effort to buy the land with the
Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, a consortium of state
and local parks agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Saying the area's zoning for recreational space depressed its price,
that authority offered $2 million, mainly raised by the horse riders, and
was the sole bidder. The school district contended that a rezoning or
residences would make it worth as much as $17 million. The district later
began the process of evicting the horse riders.</TE>
<TE>   The recreation authority sued in September, arguing that the land
should be sold only to another public entity and that the price should be
based on it staying parkland. The authority wants the stables and other
riding facilities to remain.</TE>
<TE>   "Public land is supposed to be used for a public purpose," said
Stanley Lamport, an attorney for the consortium.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Dzintra Janavs ruled Wednesday that the price of the land could
be based on the   prospect of rezoning and subdividing it for housing.
She suggested that the price would probably fall between $2 million and
$17 million.</TE>
<TE>   Lamport said the consortium will appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney for the district said the parks authority should either
give up the effort or increase its bid.</TE>
<TE>   "We would have sold it to their group," Patrick said, "but we wouldn't
have sold it for $2 million."</TE>
