<LD>Karyn Bryant's new job is pure rubbish.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant's distinctively curly hair and accessible glamour have been
key points of her appeal in various gigs ranging from her stints as
host of VH1's "Name That Video" and a love interest on the UPN comedy
"Malcolm and Eddie." But Bryant will be getting her hands--and
more--dirty as she joins Tyler Harcott in hosting TLC's "Junkyard
Wars."</LD>
<LD>   The series, returning Wednesday at 9 p.m. for its fourth season,
concerns two teams competing to create contraptions with parts they
scrounge out of a junkyard.</LD>
<TE>   "I probably now have the dirtiest job in television," Bryant said
during a break in filming last week. "We get pretty grimy. But we try
as best as we can to stay fresh, and there are lots of body wipes on
the set."</TE>
<TE>   The show is filmed in a junkyard in the San Fernando Valley. In
the first installment, the two teams attempt to build mud buggies. In
future shows, the competitors construct racing submarines, railroad
racers, and paddlewheel boats.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant says the show has already had an effect on her home life:
"I'm now a little more reluctant to throw things away."</TE>

<HD>It's Not the Rave It Once Was</HD>

<LD>It's been a long, glum summer for the Southern California rave scene,
and the party won't get any happier this week as a grim anniversary
arrives.</LD>
<LD>   Three years ago Wednesday, five young people died on a Sunday
morning when their car plunged over a steep embankment on Angeles
Crest Highway about 35 miles northeast of La Canada Flintridge. They
had just left a rave at a ski resort, and their deaths became a
high-profile hammer used against the all-night dance parties by the
scene's many foes and critics. Despite that, the region's rave scene
managed to grow. One year to the week after the fatal crash, the
seventh annual Nocturnal Wonderland rave in Indio drew about 40,000
fans, making it perhaps the largest rave in U.S. history.</LD>
<LD>   That seems like a long time ago. This year, the ninth annual
Nocturnal Wonderland was canceled altogether. Nocturnal promoter
Pasquale Rotella says it was simply too difficult to find a community
that would accept the event.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just been hard," he said, adding that disappointment fatigue
has turned off some ravers.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the events last summer got shut down, too," Rotella
said. "People buy pre-sale tickets and show up and the event is shut
down--and then that happens two or three more times, well, they stop
coming out."</TE>
<TE>   There are other factors dimming the glow of raves. "Events are
struggling," said Raymond Roker, editor in chief of Urb, a magazine
that has long tracked the rave scene. "There are promoters struggling
to get the amount of people that they got before, and some promoters
who have been doing this a long time are struggling to stay afloat."</TE>
<TE>   Roker and others say the reasons include the pinch of the economic
times, escalating fees for star deejays and the chilling effect of
law enforcement efforts against the rave world, including a federal
test case in New Orleans that has sought to use so-called "crack
house" laws to go after rave promoters as participants in drug
enterprise. A U.S. Senate bill that would sharpen those federal laws
for easier use against raves is now in the pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   The raves have also seen a chunk of their fans dance away to the
clubs and festivals that offer the vibe and sound of raves without
the long drive to a remote sites and arduous all-night schedule.
"Raves are not going away, but there does to seem to be something
missing lately," Roker said. "The machine is still churning, but the
results are not as spectacular as they were in recent years."</TE>

<HD>Box Office Has the End-of-Summer Blues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GERMAIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The signs are everywhere that summer blockbuster season has ended.</LD>
<LD>   The alien-invasion tale "Signs" climbed back to the No. 1 spot at
the box office with a $14.4 million haul in its fourth weekend, while
the espionage thriller "XXX," the top film for the last two weekends,
came in a close second with $13.7 million, according to studio
estimates Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The weekend's three new movies premiered weakly. Elizabeth Hurley
and Matthew Perry's romantic comedy "Serving Sara" was No. 6, with
$6.1 million; the Wesley Snipes-Ving Rhames prison-boxing drama
"Undisputed" was No. 8 with $4.7 million; and Al Pacino's Hollywood
satire "Simone" came in at No. 9 with $4.1 million.</LD>
<TE>   And the overall box office was down for the sixth straight
weekend. The top 12 movies grossed $63.9 million, off 22% from the
same weekend last year, when a stronger crop of holdover movies such
as "American Pie 2" and "Rush Hour 2" led the way.</TE>
<TE>   "Summer's definitely over," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of
box-office tracker Exhibitor Relations. "The difference is the last
six weeks of last summer were incredibly strong. This year, this
group of films is not standing up to that level."</TE>
<TE>   The thinning film lineup has smoothed the way for smaller
independent films. The summer's biggest sleeper hit, "My Big Fat
Greek Wedding," expanded to 1,329 theaters, up 269, and grossed $7.6
million to bring its total to $64 million. Nearly five months after
its release, the film climbed to No. 4, its highest ranking yet, up
from sixth place last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   In limited release, Robin Williams' "One Hour Photo," in which he
plays a dreary photo clerk who dangerously obsesses on a family of
customers, took in $315,000 at just seven theaters in five cities to
average a whopping $45,000 per theater.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Aniston's "The Good Girl" expanded to 188 theaters in its
third weekend and grossed $1.55 million for an impressive average of
$8,245.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood is still on track to slightly better last summer's
revenue record of about $3 billion from Memorial Day weekend through
Labor Day, Dergarabedian said. But factoring in higher admission
prices, summer 1999 remains the modern record-holder for tickets
sold, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Signs," starring Mel Gibson, premiered at No. 1 in early August
and then slipped to second place the last two weekends, behind Vin
Diesel's "XXX."</TE>
<TE>   "Signs" now has taken in $173.2 million, while "XXX" climbed to
$106.7 million, the 13th movie released this year to top $100
million.</TE>
<TE>   Both "Signs" and "Austin Powers in Goldmember," now at $194
million, are on their way to topping $200 million. They will join
"Spider-Man" and "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones" in this
year's $200-million club.</TE>

<HD>Mancini Institute Piece Strikes a Sour Note</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Don Heckman's critique (in his "All That Jazz" column, Aug. 16) of
the goals and ambitions of the Henry Mancini Institute in the wake of
founder Jack Elliott's untimely death last year needs to be
addressed. While praising the high musical skills of the orchestral
talent, Heckman takes several major swipes at the programming of this
summer's concerts under the leadership of the extremely talented and
highly respected Patrick Williams, the institute's new artistic
director.</LD>
<LD>   "What was missing," Heckman wrote, "was focus--as though Williams
had tossed as many thematic notions as possible into the programming
in the hope that they would somehow, on their own, coalesce into a
meaningful thematic basis for the future."</LD>
<LD>   I have read that sentence 10 times and have yet to figure out what
it means, since, from the get-go under the direction of Elliott, the
Mancini mission has been to present its students with a monthlong
experience that will help them on their way to being professional,
working musicians (and is, by all accounts, succeeding at that
brilliantly thus far) by exposing them to the broadest range of music
to prepare them for that eventuality.</LD>
<TE>   In that context, Heckman's criticism simply does not fly.</TE>
<TE>   Heckman goes on, "What's needed is a firmer sense of guidance and
direction involving decisions over whether the institute intends to
simply present its scholarship musicians with a pleasant summer month
encountering eclectic but not always challenging pieces of music."</TE>
<TE>   Is Heckman suggesting that the film compositions of Henry Mancini,
Erich Korngold, Elmer Bernstein, Andre Previn, Bernard Herrmann; John
Williams' outstanding, evocative score from "Close Encounters of the
Third Kind"; and Johnny Mandel's brilliantly reorchestrated suite
from "I Want to Live" are not challenging?</TE>
<TE>   Or that the music of Django Reinhardt, Herbie Hancock, Charles
Mingus, Gunther Schuller, Claus Ogerman, Sonny Rollins, Dizzy
Gillespie and Billy Childs--not to mention the compositions by the
institute's seven very talented student composers--are somehow to be
classified as lightweight fare?</TE>
<TE>   What could be more challenging than the nine concerts--ranging
from full orchestra, to chamber orchestra, to big band, and various
smaller groups--in just over three weeks? There is not an orchestra
in the land--amateur or professional--that is put to such a test,
whether it is under the direction of Elliott or Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Heckman saves his meanest swipe for last in bringing up--for the
second time, following an earlier review--what he perceives as a lack
of racial and gender diversity in the composition of the 80-person
orchestra, quoting John Clayton as saying, "Hank [Mancini] was a
pioneer in helping integrate the studios, as was Jack [Elliott],"
implying by his omission that Williams does not share that
commitment.</TE>
<TE>   I suggest that Heckman ask John Clayton directly how he personally
feels about Williams, who, after all, commissioned John to write a
piece for the season finale, which showcased the prodigious pianistic
talents of Clayton's son, Gerald--who, by the way, is African
American, like his gifted father.</TE>
<TE>   Allan Burns is a TV and film writer and producer who co-created
"The Mary Tyler Moore Show," "Rhoda" and "Lou Grant." He is a board
member of the Henry Mancini Institute and lives in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Before Nelly Heats Up, Time's Up</HD>
<DH>Following the forceful local favorite the Westside
Connection at the Arrowhead Pond, the St. Louis rapper's closing set
is abruptly ended by clock.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nelly may be the hottest star in rap over the past two years, but he
sure hasn't had much luck as a live performer in Southern California.
His long-awaited big-show debut in the area, Aug. 11 at the Beat
Summer Jam, never happened because fights in the audience ended the
show prematurely.</LD>
<LD>   Back for another round Saturday at the KPWR-FM (105.9) Back to
School Powerhouse concert at the Arrowhead Pond, Nelly was cut short
by the clock.</LD>
<LD>   The St. Louis rapper, whose new album, "Nellyville," is No. 1 this
week and has quickly sold almost 3 million, following 8 million-plus
for his debut, "Country Grammar," didn't begin his show-closing set
until nearly 12:30 a.m., an hour later than scheduled. The multi-act
concert ended abruptly just before 1 a.m., with the house lights
unceremoniously turned on just as Nelly was finishing "Dilemma," his
duet with Destiny's Child's Kelly Rowland.</LD>
<TE>   That limp ballad is uncharacteristic of Nelly's music, which is
predominantly catchy, spring-loaded hip-hop, but it represents the
kind of pop crossover gesture that gets him scolded by purists. Amid
such harder-core company Saturday as Ja Rule and the Westside
Connection, it was surprising that he'd spend precious time on it. Or
maybe it wasn't--it is his current radio hit, after all.</TE>
<TE>   Nelly usually manages to be catchy without sounding so
compromised, and the rest of the set had been much more upbeat. Nelly
is more interested in cruising and partying than in hard-core
street-life scenarios, and he has a flair for a tenacious hook and a
certain benign innocence. His recent hit "Hot in Herre" revolves
around the refrain "So take off all your clothes," but Nelly manages
to make it seem less a salacious order than a practical solution to
the rising temperature.</TE>
<TE>   With the four members of his vocal group, the St. Lunatics,
prowling and bouncing with infectious energy, the brief set moved
briskly, but Nelly himself never really came into focus. His
vocals--he actually sings more than raps--sounded fine, but he seemed
somehow remote and reserved.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the clock was on his mind, or maybe it had something to do
with following the Westside Connection. The group kept reminding the
audience that it owned the arena, but it wasn't really
necessary--with its impeccable credentials, hometown support and
sheer physical force, the trio of Ice Cube, Mack 10 and W.C. came on
like a force of nature.</TE>
<TE>   The three magnified their classic brand of gangster rap to fill
the room, creating a larger-than-life, arena-rap counterpart to
arena-rock. They also might have contributed to the time squeeze on
Nelly, loudly proclaiming that they were being told to end their
show, then loudly refusing to do so. It might have been part of the
act, but it sure pumped up the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Preceding those West Coast representatives and the Midwestern
headliner, Ja Rule led an East Coast contingent through a less
accessible course of New York hard-core. The gruff-voiced rapper
makes complex, musically diverse albums, but Saturday it was all
rat-a-tat, stop-and-start detonations. He was joined by Irv Gotti,
the head of the Murder Inc. collective, as well as other members,
including its big star, singer Ashanti.</TE>
<TE>   They're often cited as hip-hop's new dynasty, but that status
seems more likely to be determined in the studio rather than on
stage.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Not long ago, you couldn't get near the Hollywood Bowl during
Tchaikovsky Spectacular weekend, with the "sold out" sign greeting
unwary last-minute concertgoers on the Highland Avenue marquee. Not
anymore. Granted, 12,356 on Friday night is a hefty gate for Bowl
classical programs, but these concerts used to be guaranteed
sellouts.</LD>
<LD>   In recent summers, some variations on the formula have been
programmed into this Bowl institution, proving that there is plenty
of tuneful, audience-friendly Tchaikovsky to choose from. But this
edition reverted to about as unimaginative a selection as you can
get, with often-flogged war horses like the Piano Concerto No. 1 and
"Romeo and Juliet" resuming their familiar positions in front of the
"1812 Overture," flanked by wisps from "Swan Lake" ("Entrance of the
Guests") and "The Nutcracker" (a heavily edited "Waltz of the
Flowers" and "Trepak").</LD>
<LD>   John Mauceri, at least, remains as delightfully sardonic and
informative an emcee as ever, and his Hollywood Bowl Orchestra played
solidly and cohesively, even during "1812," when the crowd's
attention was understandably focused on the fireworks. Yet musical
fatigue set in during "Romeo and Juliet"; the battle scenes sounded
weary and punchy, the love theme just barely rapt enough.</LD>
<TE>   Pianist Peter Donohoe summoned a dark, heavyweight tone from the
Steinway in the concerto, pounding out the octaves in a satisfyingly
stentorian way, but not squeezing much poetry from the languours of
the first movement. While Mauceri and company matched their soloist's
thick-set textures, as usual it was hard to know whether the
intentions of the performers or the colorations of the loudspeakers
were driving the story.</TE>
<TE>   Though some cynics view this concert as being the equivalent of
waiting on line for a couple of hours at Disneyland for a 2
1/2-minute thrill ride, even they have to admit that the payoff at
the end of "1812"--those dramatic, brilliantly synchronized fireworks
--is always a kick. So it was again.</TE>

<HD>A British Protest of a U.S. Invasion</HD>
<DH>Theater* Actors union lashes out after publicly supported
National Theatre follows a West End trend by giving lead roles to
Hollywood stars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GRITTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>This has been a big year for Hollywood stars in Britain's theater,
with Gwyneth Paltrow, Madonna, Matt Damon and Woody Harrelson among
American film actors taking lead roles in West End plays here.</LD>
<LD>   But Equity, the British actors' union, has decided that enough is
enough and has lashed out at the frequent practice of giving starring
parts to American actors at a time when 80% of its membership is out
of work.</LD>
<LD>   The last straw for Equity was the casting of two Americans in
major roles for the upcoming "A Streetcar Named Desire" at the
National Theatre. Film actress Glenn Close, best known for "Fatal
Attraction" and "101 Dalmatians," will take the part of Tennessee
Williams' legendary character Blanche DuBois in the production.
Another American, Robert Pastorelli, will join Close in "Streetcar."
A third leading member of the cast, Essie Davis, is Australian, but
the role of Stanley Kowalski is being taken by British actor Iain
Glen.</LD>
<TE>   Because the National is subsidized annually by $21.5 million of
British taxpayers' money, Equity takes greater exception to its
willingness to cast Americans than when commercial theaters in the
West End do so. The union has called for a meeting to discuss hiring
practices with the National's artistic director, Trevor Nunn.</TE>
<TE>   "We are disappointed in the National Theatre," said Christine
Payne, head of theater and variety at Equity. "We do not buy the
argument that 'A Streetcar Named Desire' is an American production.
Their production of [the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical] 'Oklahoma!'
was as American as you can get, yet the stars were British."</TE>
<TE>   Equity spokesman Martin Brown added: "This is not the West End.
This is the National Theatre, which takes public investment. We
believe it's inappropriate to have three of four leads [in
'Streetcar'] from overseas."</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the National protests that it is doing nothing
wrong. "We have chosen the best actors for every role, and no union
rules have been broken," said a spokeswoman. "We have followed
correct procedures, and we are not sure what the fuss is about.
Nothing in our constitution says we can only employ only British
actors. If you take that line, you have to ask: Are we going to ban
foreign audiences? Should we be doing plays by foreign playwrights?"
There is no doubt that American screen stars, carefully cast, can add
luster to a British production, turning it into an event. Paltrow's
presence in David Auburn's "Proof" at the Donmar Warehouse made it
one of this year's hottest tickets. Madonna's star role as an art
dealer in "Up for Grabs" at the Wyndham's Theatre made even the
play's previews a must-see.</TE>
<TE>   The London premiere of Kenneth Lonergan's "This Is Our Youth" at
the Garrick Theatre became a huge word-of-mouth hit among younger
audiences; its original cast of Jake Gyllenhaal, Hayden Christensen
and Anna Paquin were succeeded by Damon, Casey Affleck and Summer
Phoenix. Harrelson (and his American co-star Kyle MacLachlan) are
helping "On an Average Day" do steady business at the Comedy Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   British and American unions have an agreement that actors of
"international status" can work in both countries and will
automatically receive work permits. The unions also operate an
exchange deal to allow their members to work overseas. In "A
Streetcar Named Desire," for example, Pastorelli was cast as part of
an approved exchange with a British actor who has appeared in the
U.S. Some 40 British actors benefit from this exchange annually.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Equity has problems with the National's casting policy
quite aside from this exchange policy. In the past, the theater has
resorted to lesser-known American actors in lead roles, especially in
revivals of American musicals. Among them are Michael Hayden, who was
Billy Bigelow in the National's much-lauded production of "Carousel,"
and Lauren Kennedy, who appeared as Nellie Forbush in last year's
National revival of "South Pacific."</TE>
<TE>   To complicate matters, the reverse does not always apply. When the
National wanted to transfer its production of "Oklahoma!" to New
York, with its original cast intact, most members were prevented from
working in the U.S. These included Maureen Lipman, who played Aunt
Eller. Lipman, a comic actress, author and TV personality, is a
household name in Britain but is virtually unknown in America.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some of Britain's leading stage actors prosper in America.
This year alone, Alan Bates and Lindsay Duncan made a huge impact on
Broadway, winning Tony awards for best lead actor and actress in a
play (for "Fortune's Fool" and "Private Lives," respectively).
British Tony nominees this year included Liam Neeson, Helen Mirren,
Alan Rickman and Kate Burton.</TE>
<TE>   But Equity believes more actors work in Britain than British
actors work in America and wants a review of the exchange
arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   The National's spokeswoman admitted an imbalance exists under
current exchange regulations. "The answer is not to make it harder
for foreign actors to work here, but to make it easier for British
actors to work in America," she said. "The British theater community
has been open to Americans. There's been interchange between the two,
but it's a long way from being reciprocated abroad."</TE>
<TE>   Many Equity members are also angry with West End producers for
relying on American star casting in their productions. One British
stage actor, who requested anonymity, told The Times: "Every time
some American film star gets cast in London theater, we always hear
how virtuous they are by accepting a huge cut in their normal pay and
taking a modest salary. But that modest salary would represent more
than a decent living for our members."</TE>
<TE>   Equity stresses that it does not wish the National to cancel its
plans to stage "Streetcar," which begins performances next month. Nor
does it want Close or any other member of the announced cast to be
replaced. But the union wants Nunn to join them in a discussion of
the general issue of casting foreign actors, in order to persuade
him, as Brown puts it, "not to go down that road in future."</TE>

<HD>100 Recordings From 20 Years of Vintage Blues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD HARRINGTON</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new four-CD collection, "When the Sun Goes Down," shines a very
bright light on the blues, a genre whose name sometimes seems to
describe its very nature. The collection specifically celebrates the
pioneering Victor label and its budget subsidiary, Bluebird, by
gathering 100 recordings from the mid-1920s to the '40s, many
unavailable since their original release on 78-rpm records.</LD>
<LD>   "When the Sun Goes Down" serves them up in wonderfully clear audio
that belies but does not undermine their true vintage.</LD>
<LD>   Producers Colin Escott and Barry Feldman are after something
bigger than simply reissuing classic blues, as implied in the
subtitle common to the four individual volumes: "The Secret History
of Rock &amp; Roll." Given sales figures for blues, this isn't simply a
canny marketing ploy to take advantage of a general roots revivalism
in effect since the surprise success of "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
and "Down From the Mountain."</LD>
<TE>   Call this one "Up From the Delta," a journey that begins in the
1920s, a golden era for rural blues that would become urbanized and
electrified during the next 20 years. It was a time when almost every
major label traveled south to record blues musicians in Atlanta,
Memphis and Nashville. And although some musicians traveled to New
York, Chicago became the core of the music's transformation, in great
part because it was home to chief Bluebird talent scout and producer
Lester Melrose.</TE>
<TE>   The material collected here informed the birth of rhythm and blues
and rock 'n' roll in the late '40s and '50s, and inspired the blues
and folk revivals of the '60s. Many of the songs first recorded for
Bluebird remain blues staples and starting points for multi-genre
explorations, but the original versions have for the most part
survived by proxy, by word of mouth or through foreign reissues.</TE>
<TE>   There's no better example of the embodiment of the series'
subtitle than the hard-to-find 78 that essentially ignited the rock
'n' roll revolution, Arthur "Big Boy" Crudup's roughhewn 1946 Victor
release, "That's All Right."</TE>
<TE>   It's taut and powerfully rhythmic, with Crudup's keening tenor and
propulsive electric guitar chordings braced by Ransom Knowling's bass
and Judge Riley's snappy drums.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in Memphis, Elvis fell under its sway, and in that
awkward first session with Scotty Moore and Bill Black, it's the song
he pulled out of his subconscious meld of blues, country, rockabilly
and gospel. It became Elvis' first Sun record and cleared the path to
his seminal sound. The singer's early ambition was surprisingly
specific: "If I ever got to the place where I could feel all ol'
Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw."</TE>
<TE>   There are many other signal tracks in this collection: Robert
Petway's "Catfish Blues," which later became Muddy Waters' classic
"Rolling Stone," inspiring the naming of both a rock band and a rock
magazine; Sonny Boy Williamson's version of "Good Morning Little
Schoolgirl," a fixture in the repertoire of bands like the Yardbirds,
the Grateful Dead and Ten Years After, as well as such disparate
singers as Waters, Rod Stewart and Taj Mahal.</TE>
<TE>   Also available are Gus Cannon's Jug Stompers' "Viola Lee Blues,"
recorded by the Grateful Dead on its 1967 debut; Blind Willie
McTell's "Statesboro Blues," which would become an Allman Brothers
staple; Big Joe Williams' mournful "Baby, Please Don't Go," adapted
by several dozen acts; and Pine Top's 1935 track "Every Day I Have
the Blues," the earliest known recording of a song that became a
standard for both Joe Williams and B.B. King.</TE>

<DH>Bruce Springsteen takes fans at the Forum concert on an
emotional journey, performing songs from 'The Rising' to honor
victims and heroes of Sept. 11</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than a quarter century, Bruce Springsteen has taken us on
personal and inspiring journeys through back streets, along Thunder
Road and down to the river.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday at the Forum in Inglewood, the New Jersey native took
us on a different trip--a more public pilgrimage to the World Trade
Center and the emotional aftermath of its destruction.</LD>
<LD>   "Can't see nothin' in front of me, can't see nothin' coming up
behind," Springsteen sang in the evening's opening number, leading us
right to ground zero and the heroism of the firefighters and other
emergency workers who walked up those darkened staircases.</LD>
<TE>   The song, "The Rising," is the title tune of Springsteen's new
album, a series of post-Sept. 11 reflections, and the memory of that
day is a thread that ran through every minute of the 2 1/2-hour
concert.</TE>
<TE>   Springsteen and the E Street Band, which played with dazzling
cohesion and command, did 11 of the 15 songs from the album, plus
earlier material that often took on extra resonance in view of the
events of the last year, including "Atlantic City" and "Land of Hope
and Dreams."</TE>
<TE>   Just before the evening's end, Springsteen paused between songs
for a couple of public service announcements.</TE>
<TE>   First, he plugged the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, a nonprofit
agency he has supported on past tours. Then, he warned everyone not
to drop their guard when it comes to civil-rights and civil-liberties
issues during this period of post-Sept. 11 alarm.</TE>
<TE>   Springsteen could have made a third public service
announcement--about the concert itself.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, there was a price tag attached to the evening's fare, but
there also was an understated sense of public duty about
Springsteen's manner. Rather than his old practice of telling stories
between songs and interacting vigorously with the band, he kept the
focus on the evening's message.</TE>
<TE>   Like most of us, he was profoundly shaken by the destruction of
Sept. 11--especially because he lives in a New Jersey county where
more than 150 of the Trade Center victims lived. In an interview in
July he said, "You would drive by the church every day and there was
another funeral."</TE>
<TE>   He felt challenged to address the issues with songs that saluted
the emergency workers and offered comfort and hope to rest of us.</TE>
<TE>   It was a difficult assignment, and it has led to an almost comical
media debate over everything from his motives to his art. A column in
the Nation magazine scolded a Village Voice reviewer who attacked the
album. Then a Wall Street Journal column ridiculed the Nation writer.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a few generic, feel-good exercises, "The Rising" is a
bold, courageous album, and the best of Saturday's concert also
radiated that spirit.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the tour is now a month old, however, the show doesn't
have the easy, convincing pace of most Springsteen concerts.</TE>
<TE>   Springsteen worked hard at the Forum, for instance, at making the
upbeat new "Mary's Place" fill the cleansing, emotional role that
"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" once did, but it just didn't quite
clear the bar Saturday. His feel-good "Countin' on a Miracle" also
felt too generic, especially when he could have used the time for
some of the more penetrating tunes from the album, including the
intimate, soul-searching "Paradise" or the tortured "Nothing Man."</TE>
<TE>   When Springsteen was on, however, he matched the most chilling and
inspiring moments that have characterized his performances since the
"Born to Run" and "Darkness on the Edge of Town" days of the '70s.
His singing remains as gritty, convincing and forceful as ever, the
veins in his neck bulging from the opening notes to the end.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rising," with its anthem-like urging to "come on up for the
rising!" and the explosive power of the band, got things off to a
joyous start.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the most emotional early spot in the show came when
Springsteen turned to two of the album's most intimate tracks. "Empty
Sky" and "You're Missing" are marvelously touching expressions of the
numbness and disorientation that anyone can feel after a loved one
has been torn from your life.</TE>
<TE>   To ease the somberness, Springsteen followed the tunes with the
sweet optimism of "Waitin' on a Sunny Day," another song from the new
album. Although the album has only been in stores for a few weeks,
the audience knew the song well enough to sing along with every word.</TE>
<TE>   After some welcome side trips for such signature tunes as "The
Promised Land" and "Thunder Road," Springsteen delivered one of the
evening's knockout punches by performing his controversial "American
Skin (41 Shots)."</TE>
<TE>   The song has been branded anti-police by some observers because it
was inspired by a 1999 slaying of an unarmed West African immigrant
by New York City police. In fact, it is a balanced look at social
tensions and the dangers of mistrust.</TE>
<TE>   Because the song isn't on "The Rising," Springsteen could easily
have left it out of the set, but he sees it, quite rightly, as an
important reminder, amid the flag-waving spirit of the times, of the
need to address serious social issues.</TE>
<TE>   The song was an ideal lead-in to "Into the Fire," a song from "The
Rising" that closed the set's formal portion. Where the song's images
about reaching for faith, strength, hope and love seem a bit too
obvious on the album, the live version was a far more soulful and
convincing treatment. It was kicked off by the haunting, chant-like
vocal that Springsteen developed on 1996's "The Ghost of Tom Joad"
solo tour.</TE>
<TE>   After the seriousness of those tunes, he and the E Street
Band--which has been expanded to nine members with violinist Soozie
Tyrell--took time for recess in the first encore, with hard-rocking
versions of "Dancing in the Dark," "Ramrod" and "Born to Run."</TE>
<TE>   For the second, however, it was back to business, focusing on the
stark "My City of Ruins" and the spirit-lifting "Land of Hope and
Dreams."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it was a sometimes rocky but triumphant stand in which
Springsteen not only held the audience's attention with a show built
around 11 new songs, but also fulfilled his career-long pledge to
make every night on stage count.</TE>
<TE>   And if you're wondering why he played the Forum rather than return
to the more glamorous, upscale Staples Center, where he performed
with the E Street Band during their 1999 reunion tour, Springsteen
gave the answer. Gazing between songs at the old arena, which is more
suited to Springsteen's blue-collar tradition, he said with smile,
"No sky boxes."</TE>

<LD>Anyone watching Sunday's trashy and worthless CBS movie, "The
Biographer: The Secret Life of Princess Di," will understand concern
in some circles about the same network's plans for an Adolf Hitler
miniseries in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   What neo-Nazi Danny Balint erroneously said in Henry Bean's "The
Believer" about Jew--"It's the only word that never loses its
meaning"--applies instead to Hitler, a name synonymous with genocide
and other crimes as incomprehensible as the logic behind them.</LD>
<LD>   A Hitler biography, charting his rise to absolute rule from youth
and obscurity, in the hands of (gulp) greedy CBS? Won't CBS
trivialize his panoramic evil by giving him the tabloid Princess Di
treatment?</LD>
<TE>   Can any commercial network, in fact, be trusted to tell with care
the childhood-to-adulthood story of modern history's greatest monster
(edging out Stalin)? And most importantly, can it be done without
making him a recruiting poster for anti-Semites and other bigots?</TE>
<TE>   We'll know that only when "Hitler" is aired.</TE>
<TE>   Mainstream TV has a bulging, mixed-quality archive of Jewish
Holocaust stories, and the airwaves have heel marks from years of
goose-stepping Nazis. The in-progress script for this CBS two-parter,
though, is drawn from British historian Ian Kershaw's book, "Hitler:
1889-1936 Hubris," that earned excellent notices when it was
published in 1999. One reviewer called it a "painstakingly scholarly
attempt to explain what may never be fully explained."</TE>
<TE>   Stories with ambiguity are rarely on commercial TV's radar.
Closure and tidy endings are beloved. So for the moment, CBS gets
credit for boldness in tackling the kind of potentially risky
material more apt to be found on pay-cable's HBO and Showtime but
which timid commercial networks are routinely chastised for avoiding.</TE>
<TE>   When one does break the mold, and then gets scorned for doing so,
that amounts to relegating commercial networks to their demons and
ordering them to conduct business as usual.</TE>
<TE>   The demons generally prevail, and may again now. Perhaps CBS has
no ambition for "Hitler" beyond serving it up as a titillating
come-on in a ratings sweeps period. On the other hand, perhaps CBS
will surprise the skeptics and come through gloriously.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Rabbi John Rosove of Temple Israel of Hollywood told
The Times recently that the producers and CBS "fail to understand ...
the impact this will have on the haters in America, as well as in
Europe and the Middle East."</TE>
<TE>   The fear is that "Hitler," however it turns out, will swell
anti-Semite rolls at a time when anger toward Jews is said to be on
the rise--a propaganda concern also advanced by some critics of "The
Believer" well before it aired on Showtime.</TE>
<TE>   Based on a real character, that film's confused 22-year-old
protagonist defied common wisdom about neo-Nazis. He was a violent
racist and anti-Semite, all right. Yet beyond that familiar skinhead
profile, he was also secretly a Jew (who had received devout
religious training as a child), as well as highly intelligent,
articulate and charismatic. His brain and agile tongue made him the
most dangerous of extremists. You could see also, however, that he
was twisted.</TE>
<TE>   As was the crowd in HBO's factual "Conspiracy," where Kenneth
Branagh's sinister, murderous arch-criminal SS Gen. Heydrich was
charming, witty and glib, the ideal host for a dinner party while
presiding instead over Nazi functionaries whose chatty ordinariness
belied their agenda. They had gathered on this wintry day in
1942--dining on an exquisite buffet lunch served with wine by butlers
in a fine old house--to secretly codify Hitler's "final solution" for
Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Society's worst heavies are rarely as one-dimensional as we wish
them to be, and it's wiser to acknowledge and understand their
complexities than to ignore them. For all we know, some of the worst
offenders in today's stock market scandals may have led stellar,
charitable lives on the home front, only to suspend those values when
they arrived at the office. Just as serial murderer John Wayne Gacy
was an admired, solid citizen who liked kids so much that he
performed as a clown for young hospital patients when he wasn't
brutalizing his adult victims.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere on TV are such internal conflicts more visible than in
several of cable's fictional crime series.</TE>
<TE>   Vic Mackey, the main man of FX's "The Shield," is an easily moved
softy at times. He's also a dirty cop and murderer.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of HBO's "The Sopranos" accuse it of glorifying
gangsterdom by tapping the humanity in its criminal characters.</TE>
<TE>   Mafia boss Tony Soprano is a killer, but also a devoted father who
once waxed another mobster while touring college campuses with his
teenage daughter. His wife, Carmela, at once endorses old-fashioned
family values and, tacitly, Tony's line of work that keeps the family
in riches.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of glamour, however, overlapping and clashing realities
give the show's characters all the more credibility.</TE>
<TE>   As they do in the "The Wire," David Simon's series about
wire-tapping Baltimore police and violent drug dealers winding up its
first extraordinary season of Sunday nights on HBO.</TE>
<TE>   It's a tossup, at times, which side of the law is more corrupt, as
lines between good and evil blur in turbulent parallel universes
where cops and drug lords bloody themselves in turf wars. The genius
here centers on Simon's ability to somehow create sympathy for some
of these "Yo" boys selling smack in the projects while not softening
damage from the crimes they commit in this rarely observed
subculture.</TE>
<TE>   Simon walks a high wire here, just as CBS will in its miniseries
that, best-case scenario, will make us smarter about Hitler's
relationship with the German people and the conditions that lifted
him to power after he had failed at nearly everything. Instead of
something to fear, "Hitler" may turn out to be something to admire.</TE>
<TE>   Knowledge is another word that never loses its meaning.</TE>

<HD>Peckinpah, Uncensored and Upgraded</HD>
<DH>Film* Now that Britain has lifted its ban on 'Straw Dogs,'
scholarly fans gather in L.A. to work on a DVD loaded with extras.
Will it play in the U.S.?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE KIRGO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a hot night last month, a small band of scholars, colleagues and
die-hard defenders of the faith gathered in a West Los Angeles
recording studio to take a stand for filmmaker Sam Peckinpah and one
of his most controversial movies, the 1971 thriller "Straw Dogs."</LD>
<LD>   The occasion: the recording of a pair of commentary tracks for a
new, extras-heavy DVD release of the film in Britain, where it has
been banned since the passage of the 1984 Video Recordings Act,
popularly known as the "Video Nasties" law.</LD>
<LD>   British censors had a field day with "Straw Dogs' " disturbing
depiction of violence (including a double rape) unleashed by mounting
tensions between an American academic (Dustin Hoffman), his English
wife (Susan George) and the denizens of a Cornwall village. Despite
the pleas of passionate advocates, the film--referred to by one
conservative English critic as "a running sewer disgorging human
waste"--was consigned to a limbo occupied by such exploitation fare
as "Driller Killer" and "S.S. Experiment Camp."</LD>
<TE>   But thanks to a years-long fight led by English Peckinpah fan and
anti-censorship activist Peter Woods, the ban on "Straw Dogs" was
finally lifted July 1. Within days, the film's British distributor,
Fremantle Media, had contacted Nick Redman, a Los Angeles-based film
music producer who had produced "The Wild Bunch: An Album in
Montage," an Oscar-nominated documentary about what many consider
Peckinpah's greatest film. Would he organize the recording of
commentary tracks for the new DVD, being rushed into release in
Britain in October?</TE>
<TE>   Would he ever. Greeting the evening's participants in a tiny
recording booth crammed with chairs, microphones and a flat-screen
monitor on which they'll view the film, the wiry, intense Redman says
emphatically, "I will always be involved when asked in a Peckinpah
project, because Peckinpah's work means more to me than anyone
else's."</TE>
<TE>   He is seconded by Paul Seydor, his director-collaborator on the
"Wild Bunch" documentary and author of the seminal book, "Peckinpah:
The Western Films" (University of Illinois Press, 1997). Seydor, one
of Hollywood's most respected film editors, is elegantly professorial
in appearance and expression but swiftly punctures any hint of
pretension.</TE>
<TE>   "Making this commentary affords a chance to provide context for
'Straw Dogs'--political, cultural, yak, yak, all that stuff," he says
before the recording session begins. "But audiences will never become
reconciled to Peckinpah's work. He'll never become a popular artist
like Stanley Kubrick. We'll have to change as human beings before
that happens."</TE>
<TE>   Garner Simmons, a screenwriter and author of a highly personal
film-by-film career study, "Peckinpah: A Portrait in Montage"
(Limelight Editions, 1998), concurs. " 'Straw Dogs' is not easy to
watch," he says, "and it shouldn't be."</TE>
<TE>   "Controversy is an acknowledgment of a work's seriousness," adds
Seydor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a testament to the power of Peckinpah's work," chimes in
biographer-screenwriter David Weddle, author of "If They Move, Kill
'Em!": The Life and Times of Sam Peckinpah" (Grove Press, 1994).
"It's the unsettling insights into human nature that give Sam's films
their emotional charge and upset censor boards."</TE>
<TE>   A sense of vindication charges discussion of the prospective
British release. "The ban never should have been put in place," says
Simmons, "but at least now they'll get this special edition. And
maybe an American distributor will pick it up."</TE>
<TE>   His colleagues are excited by the possibilities. "Straw Dogs" is
available in the U.S. only in a no-frills version from Anchor Bay;
instantly a wish list takes shape. Maybe there could be a making-of
documentary, additional commentaries, a new transfer....</TE>
<TE>   "Let's not leave it in the lobby," says engineer Jim Allan,
settling the quartet of Peckinpah mavens in their seats, giving them
mikes the visual reference for the commentary's starting point: the
Cinerama Releasing Corp. logo.</TE>
<TE>   They'll be joined later in the evening by Katy Haber, the
director's longtime friend and associate, who met Peckinpah when she
started work as his production secretary on "Straw Dogs"; her
separate commentary track will detail the day-to-day struggles--and
there were many--on making the film.</TE>
<TE>   But now what Redman calls "the authors' forum" is up, and the
authors are looking excited but nervous.</TE>
<TE>   A few last reassuring words from engineer Allan ("corrections are
possible"), the logo pops up and they're off. Seydor plunges in,
elaborating on the opening shot, a queasily out-of-focus fog that
resolves into the disquieting image of children playing in a
cemetery: "The first thing Peckinpah does is disorient you. You don't
know what you're looking at, then gradually you realize that you're
looking down at a graveyard, and there's a sense of foreboding."</TE>
<TE>   All jump in, expressing their admiration for the swift, clear
strokes with which the film introduces characters, setting, mood.
"That's deft screenwriting," says Simmons (the screenplay is credited
to Peckinpah and David Z. Goodman).</TE>
<TE>   As the film's increasingly disturbing images unwind, the comments
come fast and furious, ranging from the minutely specific--"Here it
comes! This is it! The solo violin!" Seydor cries excitedly about one
of composer Jerry Fielding's apt musical cues--to the broadly
general.</TE>
<TE>   Performances are admired: "There's an anger in Dustin [Hoffman]
that's extraordinary," says Simmons. Weddle agrees: "He went to such
a dark place for a movie star to go to." Snorts Redman, "Stars these
days have to be sympathetic."</TE>
<TE>   Awareness of the film's troubled history in Britain haunts the
discussion. "The British couldn't buy these demented locals," Simmons
says, "but we know these people, all over the world. [Their violence]
isn't British; it isn't American. It's human."</TE>
<TE>   Haber, now the managing director of the British Academy of Film
and Television Arts-Los Angeles, will later reflect that if the film,
which she calls "a western set in Cornwall," had been set in America,
it might have escaped the ban. "After all," she says, " 'The Wild
Bunch' wasn't banned."</TE>
<TE>   Nor, she points out, was Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange,"
another notorious milestone of cinematic violence, also set in
England, also directed by an American. Released within weeks of
"Straw Dogs," "A Clockwork Orange" was pulled from circulation by
Kubrick himself after the film was linked with several real-life
crimes that took place in England in 1972-73. But there was never any
official sanction against the film, and the Peckinpah posse thinks it
knows why.</TE>
<TE>   " 'A Clockwork Orange' keeps you at arm's length," says Simmons.
"Its violence is stylized, so it's safe. You can tell yourself, 'This
isn't real.' "</TE>
<TE>   From the Kubrick film, Seydor adds, "You can take out a neatly
paraphraseable message: violence is bad. But 'Straw Dogs' stirs up
incredibly powerful feelings and will not resolve them for you in any
way. It unsettles you, disturbs you, makes you angry, and there are
no buffers.</TE>
<TE>   "You come away thinking, 'Why am I feeling this? There must be
something wrong with this movie, because God forbid there's something
wrong with me!' " All agree that there are things here that make for
tough viewing. As the infamous rape scene comes up, the room goes
quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons shakes his head. "As many times as I've seen it, it's
still hard to sit through."</TE>
<TE>   Weddle recalls the words of Peckinpah's son-in-law, screenwriter
Gill Dennis: "Sam was making movies about things that people wouldn't
acknowledge were there. It was like he was saying, 'See that? What do
you think of that? How does that fit into your scheme of things?' "</TE>
<TE>   As the film ends, the commentators emerge, more enthusiastic than
ever.</TE>
<TE>   "Every image ignites a memory or thought," Simmons marvels.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time it's over," says Seydor, "you're just getting warmed
up and you want to keep going."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For jazz music and tap-dance buffs, there's no better way to loll
away a summer's evening than at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre,
savoring the sights and sounds of the invigorating Jazz Tap Ensemble.</LD>
<LD>   And so it was Friday when the ensemble, under the top-drawer
direction of Lynn Dally, tossed off another program of well-honed
standards and a number of Los Angeles premieres under the banner "A
New Generation."</LD>
<LD>   The bad news? Ace hoofer Channing Cook Holmes was sidelined with a
back injury, though he kept his hand in by pounding out some heated
rhythms on conga drum, aiding crack musicians Doug Walter, Domenic
Genova and Jerry Kalaf, the trio's director.</LD>
<TE>   The good news?</TE>
<TE>   Dally, whose middle name must surely be Style but who hasn't been
dancing recently, took to the stage with a moxie mellowness that
belied her intricate footwork, seeming to float, at times, through a
host of pieces, notably her new solo, "I Hear a Rhapsody," where
heel-toe turns ruled. Hello, Dally! It's so nice to see you back
where you belong.</TE>
<TE>   Other fierce solo premieres: Derick K. Grant in "Rhythm Changes"
and "Solo X," both choreographed by the dancer to Kalaf's music.
Sliding and gliding highlighted the former, while balancing on one
toe in the midst of delivering a fusillade of rhythms brought the
house down in the latter.</TE>
<TE>   A brilliant Charon Aldredge combined sex and speed as she rocked
in a sparkly halter top, split jumping and one-shoe shuffling in her
take on Thelonius Monk's "In Walked Bud."</TE>
<TE>   Aldredge's feet also oozed electricity in "Afro Blue," with
trance-like spins predominating, while John Kloss displayed
bullet-like bravado in his "How High the Moon."</TE>
<TE>   The "new generation" of the program title also delivered: The
Caravan Project (tappers ages 13 to 19), founded by Dally in 1991,
premiered "Without Eddie," Becky Twitchell's finger-snapping
choreography; "Chan's Blues," choreographed by Holmes, saw the dozen
dancers in march-like mode; and Mark Mendonca's a cappella piece,
"Mark's Dance," provided ample cascades of percussive foot stamping.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Slyde's beloved classic, "Interplay," closed the show with a
bang and a tapper-filled stage.</TE>

<HD>VH1 Celebrates Special Brand of Rock Doc</HD>
<DH>The low-rated music channel marks five years of its
ratings-grabbing 'Behind the Music' with a marathon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NEKESA MUMBI MOODY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>After spending five years chronicling the rise, fall, and redemption
of rock's biggest and wackiest stars, "Behind the Music" narrator Jim
Forbes admits there are some phrases he gets sick of repeating.</LD>
<LD>   No, it's not the now famous line about hitting "rock bottom."</LD>
<LD>   "You know the line that's always bugged me? 'He or she was only X
years old when he or she died,' " Forbes says with a laugh. "Well,
you always want to live longer.</LD>
<TE>   "I fight so hard not to become a caricature of myself, and not to
become a cliche, and to deliver those lines with sincerity."</TE>
<TE>   Despite--or perhaps because of--its sometimes predictable formula,
the VH1 biography series has become one of television's most copied
and parodied shows.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Behind the Music' in five years has already managed to make it
to 'The Simpsons.' Need we say more?" said Robert Thompson, professor
of media and popular culture at Syracuse University. The animated
show won an Emmy for its satire episode, "The Simpsons: Behind the
Laughter."</TE>
<TE>   Not only is "Behind the Music" VH1's longest-running show, it is
also the low-rated network's most consistent ratings grabber; it's
currently running neck and neck with another biography show,
"Driven," as VH1's most popular program.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the channel celebrates "Behind the Music's" five-year
anniversary with a marathon, including some of its most popular and
notorious episodes, hosted by comedian Cedric the Entertainer.</TE>
<TE>   There's Shania Twain's tearful account of her parents' deaths; MC
Hammer's account of his fall from stardom to bankruptcy; and Leif
Garrett's awkward reunion with the friend paralyzed in an accident
Garrett caused.</TE>
<TE>   "It's exploitation reality TV," Garrett says somewhat derisively.
Yet he admits that his "Behind the Music" episode helped rekindle
interest in his forgotten musical career.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing was really good, so it did help for sure getting
people to see what I am doing now."</TE>
<TE>   Although "Behind the Music" has profiled stars such as Twain,
Faith Hill and Madonna, it got its start profiling those whose luster
had dimmed. The show's first subject was Milli Vanilli, the pop duo
disgraced for lip-syncing to other people's voices.</TE>
<TE>   The series "came out of questions that were asked like, 'Whatever
happened to Milli Vanilli?' " says George Moll, its executive
producer. "We didn't know exactly what the show was going to be, but
we thought that there was a good documentary."</TE>
<TE>   The caveat was that the subjects had to cooperate and be willing
to delve into uncomfortable topics. Fabrice Morvan of Milli Vanilli,
trying to put the scandal behind him, wasn't sure he wanted to go
into it again.</TE>
<TE>   "After a while, I think I felt comfortable enough to do it ... and
we came to realize that maybe it would be a good thing. It would be
the first interview all by myself," said Morvan. "A week after, the
people on the streets were like, 'Hey man, keep doing your thing,'
very supportive."</TE>
<TE>   Getting faded stars to reveal intimate secrets wasn't that
difficult. Persuading successful stars such as Sean "P. Diddy" Combs
or Lenny Kravitz to delve into the messier aspects of their lives was
more of a challenge, says Moll.</TE>
<TE>   "When we first started out, we went to artists who would give us
great access ... and a lot of those acts were well beyond their
prime," he says. "It took some time to get people like Madonna, Cher
and people like that on board."</TE>
<TE>   Still, among the most popular "Behind the Music" episodes are
those featuring C-list stars, such as David Cassidy, the Monkees and
MC Hammer.</TE>
<TE>   "If you lift the celebrity element out of the story, it is still a
great human drama," Moll says.</TE>
<TE>   And that makes good television, says Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   "As a professor and an academic, I would have no problem assigning
several 'Behind the Music' episodes to students, putting them on
reserve at the library," he says. "It's a step or two higher than the
average 'Where are they now' documentary."</TE>
<TE>   Since "Behind the Music" first aired in 1997, biography series
have proliferated: Lifetime's "Intimate Portrait" and MTV's "Diary,"
among others.</TE>
<TE>   But Moll says "Behind the Music" is more revealing than many.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of stories that had never been told before.... We
even had band members say, 'I never knew that happened to my
bandmate!' "</TE>
<TE>   Over the past few years, the show has shifted from older,
baby-boom performers to more contemporary acts; among recent subjects
are Aaliyah, Dr. Dre and No Doubt.</TE>
<TE>   But don't expect an 'N Sync or Britney Spears edition anytime
soon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to do a story on an artist who's 20 years old and who
has two records and grew up in the suburbs," Moll says.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'll do Eminem in a heartbeat. It's about the backstory."</TE>
<TE>   Episodes of "Behind the Music" air from 10 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. each
night this week on VH1.</TE>

<LD>The 22nd annual two-day Sunset Junction street fair opened Saturday
with its usual fascinating intersection of the cultures and
subcultures inhabiting Silver Lake, Los Feliz and Echo Park.</LD>
<LD>   Live music on three stages along Sunset Boulevard in Silver Lake
not only provided an appropriately diverse soundtrack but also made
for a major summer happening as an overflowing crowd gathered for the
night-closing set from New York rockers Sonic Youth.</LD>
<LD>   Booked by the folks behind area nightclubs Spaceland and the Echo,
the 30 local and national acts included former Supremes singer Mary
Wilson, popular DJ Juan Atkins, space-rockers the Warlocks,
blues-rocker Gregg Young and the engaging East L.A. Sabor Factory, a
confident young band whose rapped and sung tales of inner-city life
recalled Ozomatli and the spirit, if not the sound, of Los Lobos.</LD>
<TE>   Latino families, miniskirted drag queens, Hula-Hoop-toting punks,
face-tattooed modern primitives, sunlight-braving goths and thousands
of colorful characters genially toured the trinket and clothing
vendors, ethnic food, and carnival rides and games.</TE>
<TE>   Signs of the gentrification that many longtime residents revile
were possibly evident in booths hawking cabinet veneers, electric
vehicles and fancy furniture, but you could still replace that
worn-out bondage harness, pick up some gorgeous goddess-wear or get a
free mohawk.</TE>
<TE>   Two hours before Sonic Youth's scheduled start time, fans pressed
into one stage area for a thunderous hourlong set by newly
revitalized grunge icons Mudhoney. The Seattle band mixed old
favorites with a heaping portion of its just-released album, "Since
We've Become Translucent."</TE>
<TE>   Grunge may be practically ready for the dreaded "revival" phase,
but such numbers as "Our Time Is Now" and a cover of Hawkwind's
"Urban Guerrilla" proved Mudhoney still has its finger on the pulse
of the disaffected.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Sonic Youth started playing the alternately catchy
rockers and meandering art tunes, the audience had swelled so much
that the police weren't letting anyone else into the festival area.
No matter. Hundreds clustered outside, behind the stage and on the
balcony and rooftop of an adjacent mini-mall to listen as the
flashing stage lights and singer Thurston Moore's screams echoed the
strobe effects and delighted howls coming from the midway rides. A
midsummer night's dream gig, indeed.</TE>

<HD>Carl Stone Still Rocking With His Sonic Style</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once a familiar fixture in Southern California new-music circles,
electronic music composer Carl Stone now spends most of his time in
Japan, with pit stops in San Francisco. He did, however, return to
the old neighborhood Saturday night, stopping by the Schindler House
to unfurl some of his latest sonic collages. And it is remarkable
music too, a technologically liberated descendant of musique
concrete, in which Stone builds unusually coherent structures from
found and natural sounds on his Mac G3 laptop computer.</LD>
<LD>   The most absorbing piece, "Nak Won," was also the most rigorously
organized of the lot, where dueling drones were slowly overcome by
what sounded like pop organ fragments and melted into a deliciously
amorphous mass. Yet the drones eventually reassert themselves amid
the complexity, and the piece winds down in reverse order, almost
like a palindrome. It's the work of an assured master of his chosen
esoteric idiom.</LD>
<LD>   Following "Kruetz," an ethereal intermezzo, Stone offered two
excerpts from "Guelaguetza,"--the first of which featured rapid retro
sounds that took us back 50 years to the early days of musique
concrete, while the second was the equivalent of pressing the
fast-forward button on a CD player.</LD>
<TE>   Though the architecture of "Darul Kabap" was more difficult to
grasp, one could approach it like a free-jazz
improvisation--beginning with a jagged bass line, loading up with
Indian and Japanese fragments and passionate voices zapped by
electronic slaps at high volume.</TE>
<TE>   By then, even the usually impassive Stone was physically jostled
about by this frenetic music, and passing aircraft seemed like
integral parts of the puzzle.</TE>

<HD>Greek Mythology Revisited</HD>
<DH>'Gods and Goddesses' explores the complex relationships of
mortals and Greek deities in a two-hour documentary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since the earliest days of mankind, when our cave-dwelling forebears
first sat trembling in the darkness after an angry peal of thunder
from above, people have sought to create a belief system that brought
order and understanding to a frightening and uncertain world.</LD>
<LD>   But it took a Greek named Homer to weave the tangled lineage of
stories and legends into classic form around 750 BC, giving the
people around him the closest thing they had to a bible. And it's the
divine yet often flawed inhabitants of these tales who enliven a
scholarly but entertaining overview of this world in tonight's
History Channel documentary "Gods and Goddesses" (9 p.m.).</LD>
<LD>   Using sweeping vistas of historic ruins as a backdrop, the special
explores day-to-day life in ancient Greece and the intricate tales
that served as the collective unconscious of the civilization.</LD>
<TE>   "Life was felt to be fairly precarious, and you needed to do
anything you could to get whatever powers that ruled the world on
your side," says USC professor Greg Thalmann. "Many of them lived one
drought away from starvation, and you just didn't mess around with a
world like that."</TE>
<TE>   The complex hierarchy of the gods, with Zeus and Hera ruling
supreme, is laid out in sometimes lurid detail in the two-hour
program. There evidently was plenty of sleeping around up on Mt.
Olympus, and the gods and goddesses weren't hesitant to share their
divine favors with the flatlander mortals, either.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the documentary notes that the Greeks were comfortable with
the concept of gods who weren't always perfect or ethical, which is
perhaps why unlike in many cultures, the Greek deities were
envisioned as having human form.</TE>
<TE>   The story of Hercules, we learn, is a key example. The product of
a dalliance between Zeus and a mortal woman, the legendary strongman
largely dedicated his life to doing the right thing, while avoiding
the enmity of Zeus' betrayed mate, Hera.</TE>
<TE>   Upon his death, Hercules, by virtue of his good deeds (and with
considerable lobbying by Dad), was allowed to ascend to Mt. Olympus.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of years later, when the apostle Paul began spreading the
word of Jesus, the program says, he found a receptive audience among
the Greeks, to whom the concept of a figure born of a mortal mother
and a divine father was part and parcel of their own ancient culture.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps not wishing to step on any ecclesiastical toes, "Gods
and Goddesses" explains that the Greeks, already moving toward
monotheism by 300 BC, accepted Paul's message on its own merit, and
not merely as an extension of their own polytheistic heritage.</TE>
<TE>   But what a fascinating heritage it is.</TE>
<TE>   "Gods and Goddesses" airs tonight from 9 to 11 p.m. on the History
Channel.</TE>

<HD>Spectrum's Offerings Uneven but Edgy</HD>
<DH>Unpredictability and a range of skill levels mark the 16
pieces, ranging from a sex-and-violence mens' tango to a woman's solo
of struggle and survival.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From energetic kids learning to present themselves onstage to
seasoned artists premiering high-concept vehicles, the 12th edition
of Spectrum: Dance in L.A. offered every kind of dance except the
stale, academic variety.</LD>
<LD>   In 16 pieces performed in 2 1/2 hours at the Ivar Theatre on
Saturday, the latest installment in this quarterly showcase series
managed to make even its unevenness a testament to the restless
vitality of the local dance scene.</LD>
<LD>   You want body heat? It doesn't come much hotter than Cati Jean's
sex-and-violence tango, "Hombre," for eight men, performed with some
uncertainty when risky lifts dominated the dancing but otherwise
devastatingly secure.</LD>
<TE>   You want an icy put-down of gender stereotypes? "Used Forms," a
duet by Dani Lunn and Erin Hirsh, efficiently cataloged and mocked
every pouty, slinky cliche that dancing women get stuck with.</TE>
<TE>   Other contemporary group pieces kept this Spectrum edgy and
unpredictable. In what seemed an abstraction of the Middle East
conflict, Loren Denker-Slutsky and Brian Frette moved from fervent
acts of worship to increasingly angry combat in their "Losing the
Light" duet. Mark Swanhart's "Prajna" found him infusing a languorous
female subculture with insular male energy, and Deborah Brockus'
showpiece quartet "Flood" kept switching its speed and style of
attack to keep her dancers and audience alert.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all, Jamie Nichols' "If She Could Remember" surrounded a
suffering central figure (Nichols herself) in a chair, with a vortex
of dancing women, a memorable performance for its depth of feeling
and unusual formal patterning.</TE>
<TE>   Four women's solos explored nonliteral dance drama, often with
problematic accompaniments. An intense Laura Nyro recording
overwhelmed Denise Leitner's "Pathways #2," for instance, despite the
remarkable freshness of Val Halon's dancing. And Lisa K. Lock's
superb mastery of mood and pose in "Pending" looked insufficient when
the Penderecki music suddenly exploded apocalyptically.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Elizabeth Hoefner skillfully set the simplest moves
against the lushest Samuel Barber music in "Grace Lives Here," and
Narineh Ghazarians made Anna Djanbazian's "By Your Side" into a
compelling statement of struggle and survival, using unlikely music
originally composed for Cirque du Soleil as if it had her in mind.</TE>
<TE>   In the evening's only male solo, Ken Morris' "Metamorphosis" used
powerful upper-body action to camouflage weak legwork as it depicted
an emergence into a new, fearful state of being.</TE>
<TE>   World dance has not often been a Spectrum specialty, but Gustavo
Gonzalez delivered some of the sharpest, most spirited execution on
the program with "Sones Tamaulipecos" for his AguaLuna ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Far simpler in technique, Sarah Bashir's "Tangos de Malaga" served
her Esencia Flamenca women capably, but Shelley Puente's challenge
dance for her Everything Celtic Dance and Music Troop proved too
brief to make a strong impression.</TE>
<TE>   Among other disappointments, Roscoe Farnsworth's jitterbugging
"Cajun Love" didn't break out of its character comedy into sustained
dancing long enough to be rewarding, and Eric Henderson's pop
confection "The Last Dance" looked like the first dance for the green
teens of his E4D Performance Company. But you've got to start
somewhere, and Spectrum is nothing if not welcoming.</TE>
<TE>   Live music enhanced the Bashir, Henderson and Nichols segments.</TE>

<LD>It's a match made in headquarters, not in heaven.</LD>
<LD>   Inspector Thomas Lynley, the eighth earl of Asherton, is a rich,
cynical rake--part Marlowe, part Gatsby. Sgt. Barbara Havers is a
brusque, resentful product of the working class--a cockney, female
Andy Sipowicz.</LD>
<LD>   After meeting her he mutters, "For once the film is more exciting
than the trailer. The woman is a minefield."</LD>
<TE>   When these sleuths team up to investigate a decapitation on a
bleak Yorkshire farm, the immediate mystery is whether they can keep
from killing each other long enough to solve the crime at hand.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to "The Inspector Lynley Mysteries: A Great Deliverance,"
a droll two-part "Mystery!" airing back-to-back from 9 to midnight
tonight on KCET. The miniseries was adapted by Lizzie Mickery from
Elizabeth George's bestseller and directed by Richard Laxton.</TE>
<TE>   Disdain, it turns out, is the reaction New Scotland Yard was
looking for in pairing Lynley (a suave Nathaniel Parker) with Havers
(a simmering Sharon Small). Both are outcasts in their own ways from
the regular guys on the force, and the brass wouldn't mind seeing a
blow-up that gets the pair booted.</TE>
<TE>   Despite this dynamite setup, "A Great Deliverance" is imperfect,
like the crime it depicts. Even "Mystery!" fans who usually find
themselves clueless probably can figure out the straightforward
whodunit before intermission.</TE>
<TE>   But the true fun comes from watching the tantalizingly slow
evolution of an oddly effective partnership. When Lynley at one point
suggests a peacemaking chat, Havers snaps back in Dennis Franz
fashion, "I'm a more 'do' and less 'talk' sort of person," and the
tension that counts is cranked up another notch.</TE>

<HD>New Treatment Zaps Acne but Not Healthy Skin</HD>
<DH>Dermatology* The light-exposure system, recently approved
by the FDA, kills the bacteria behind breakouts without irritation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new light treatment that eliminates acne-causing skin bacteria
without burning, redness or irritation may be a good alternative to
topical lotions and oral antibiotics for patients with moderate
breakouts.</LD>
<LD>   The Food and Drug Administration last week approved the ClearLight
system for moderate cases of inflammatory acne vulgaris, which is
harder to treat than the superficial pimples some people suffer and
which can leave permanent scars. As many as 80% of all people develop
acne at some point, most frequently in adolescence when hormonal
changes increase the amount of oil produced by the skin's sebaceous
glands and create blockages of the pores.</LD>
<LD>   With the ClearLight system, patients usually undergo twice-weekly
treatments for four weeks at the dermatologist's office. During those
visits, the affected skin of the face or back is exposed for 15
minutes to a narrow band of blue light, which destroys the
Propionibacterium acnes bacteria without harming surrounding skin.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike other types of light treatments that have been used on
acne, such as UVB light, ClearLight doesn't age the skin and doesn't
appear to cause skin cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The product offers an alternative for patients worried about the
side effects of oral isotretinoin (Accutane), which requires that
they be monitored through regular blood tests. It's also designed to
offer a choice for those whose skin is irritated by common
treatments, such as Retin A, which causes drying and redness; or
benzoyl peroxide, which can overly dry the skin; or those for whom
antibiotics don't work well, said Dr. Alan Shalita, a dermatologist
at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center in
Brooklyn.</TE>
<TE>   In some patients, acne-causing bacteria have become less sensitive
to commonly used antibiotics, such as tetracycline, doxycycline and
minocycline, he said. As a result, dermatologists sometimes combine
them with topical medications such as benzoyl peroxide.</TE>
<TE>   ClearLight, made by an Israeli firm, Lumenis Ltd., makes a
non-issue out of antibiotic insensitivity. However, Shalita said it
may turn out to be even more effective when applied in conjunction
with other acne-fighting products, such as antibiotics, Retin A and
related products or benzoyl peroxide.</TE>
<TE>   In the clinical trials led by Shalita, researchers used the light
treatment on 28 volunteer patients, treating half of the face. After
one month, they compared the untreated halves of the faces to the
treated halves. About 70% of the patients improved by at least 50% on
the treated side; about 30% improved on the untreated side, which may
indicate that the treatment had a systemic anti-inflammatory effect,
Shalita said. Most patients continued to improve for at least one
month after they finished the treatment; they maintained the
improvement for up to three months.</TE>
<TE>   A drawback of ClearLight is that it requires frequent visits to
the doctor's office. But Shalita said doctors may be able to modify
the treatment regimen to make it more convenient.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Richard Glogau, a dermatologist at UC San Francisco, said the
light treatment could be valuable for patients "who find other things
too irritating."</TE>

<HD>Arthritis Study Suggests New Link</HD>
<DH>Report* Researchers say carbohydrates in the cartilage, not
peptides, may be the cause. Discovery could lead to new treatments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG FROST</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>In a finding that could lead to new treatments for arthritis, U.S.
researchers said last week that naturally occurring carbohydrates may
be the elusive cause of the illness.</LD>
<LD>   The carbohydrates, known as glycosaminoglycans, or GAGS, appear to
activate cells that are part of the body's immune system, causing the
painful inflammation that afflicts hundreds of millions of people
around the world, they said.</LD>
<LD>   "This study shows that rheumatoid arthritis may result from the
body's mishandling of its own carbohydrates that, under normal
circumstances, would not be interpreted as a threat," said Julia
Wang, the study's lead researcher.</LD>
<TE>   Wang, who presented her research at the national meeting of the
American Chemical Society, said her finding has come under heavy
attack because it challenged the conventional thinking that
peptides--little pieces of protein--are responsible for auto-immune
diseases such as arthritis.</TE>
<TE>   "The concept that carbohydrates can be responsible for auto-immune
diseases is completely new," she told Reuters. "People simply don't
want to recognize it. They've been taught peptides are responsible,
which is understood."</TE>
<TE>   Although there have been promising advances in treating the
symptoms of arthritis, its causes have remained a mystery.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is that people have been trying to search to
understand arthritis by sticking to the old dogma, but that hasn't
solved the problem," said Wang, a researcher at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School.</TE>
<TE>   The new research marked the first time glycosaminoglycans, a major
component of joint cartilage, joint fluid, connective tissue and
skin, have been associated with the condition.</TE>
<TE>   Wang said she and her colleague Michael Roehrl studied the effects
glycosaminoglycans had on mice, which subsequently experienced
arthritic symptoms including swelling, inflammation and joint damage.
She also looked at human tissue taken from arthritis patients and
found the same type of cells that bind to GAGs.</TE>
<TE>   Wang said subsequent research would most likely focus on
developing drugs aimed at stopping the growth, expansion or adhesion
of immune cells that react to GAGs.</TE>
<TE>   John Mekalanos, professor and chairman of microbiology and
molecular genetics at Harvard Medical School, said the research is
very promising. "We are clearly a step closer to understanding the
causes of a disease that has left the medical community with
unanswered questions and many patients with discomfort and pain," he
said in a statement.</TE>

<HD>Can Web Fill Pharmacy's Role?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB ROSENBLATT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many Americans now regularly use the Internet to find bargains on air
travel, consumer loans and children's toys, but how useful is the Web
in finding less expensive prescription drugs that are vital to your
health? And what are the pitfalls in using the Internet instead of
your local pharmacist?</LD>
<LD>   It's not surprising that consumers would turn to the Internet to
look for deals on prescription drugs. Americans spent a record $154
billion filling their prescriptions last year, up 17% from 2000. The
average price of a prescription at a retail pharmacy was $49.84 last
year, up more than $4.50 from 2000. Why are prices increasing so
quickly? Well, drug companies are increasing their prices, and
doctors are prescribing more drugs. Also, many patients are switching
to new and often more expensive medications that promise more
effectiveness with fewer side effects.</LD>
<LD>   A survey by AARP found that 76% of Americans older than 45 take a
prescription drug on a regular basis.</LD>
<TE>   Recognizing the growing demand, many leading pharmacy chains,
including Rite-Aid and CVS, now operate online pharmacies. One
company, MedcoHealth Solutions, claims to be the first online
pharmacy to have reached $1 billion in sales. Besides the large
pharmacy chains, there are a host of smaller firms doing business in
the United States and Canada. Anyone with an e-mail address is
probably swamped with electronic solicitations for discounts on
Viagra or a host of herbal remedies to treat baldness, weight loss
and assorted other disorders.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to rein in the Wild West atmosphere of the Internet, state
officials have stepped in to help consumers by attempting to regulate
online pharmacies. The National Assn. of Boards of Pharmacy, whose
members are officials of 50 state agencies that regulate pharmacies,
has created a procedure to investigate and certify online pharmacies.
Approved sites are given a seal of approval identifying them as
Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites, or VIPPS. So far, 13
online pharmacies have received approval, including CVS.com,
Eckerds.com, Drugstore.com, RxRequest.com and Medcohealth.com. (For a
complete list, go to the pharmacy board's Web site, at www.nabp.net,
scroll down to the section on "Internet pharmacy" and click on "Find
a VIPPS-certified pharmacy.")</TE>
<TE>   Consumers should be wary of Web sites that offer to send drugs but
only require a health questionnaire with an order. Any legitimate
online pharmacy will insist on getting a copy of the doctor's
prescription. And a legitimate site will have a toll-free number
where consumers can call a pharmacist with questions.</TE>
<TE>   Online pharmacies in Canada are making a strong pitch to
price-conscious Americans, though technically it's illegal for U.S.
residents to make such purchases. They promise bigger discounts than
their cyber rivals in the United States. There's some truth to those
pitches, as Canadian drug prices can be significantly lower than U.S.
prices. Canadian drug prices are regulated by the government; U.S.
prices are not. Also a favorable exchange rate makes Canadian drugs
cheaper for Americans. One Canadian government study found that
Canadian prices for brand-name drugs on average were 62% of U.S.
prices.</TE>
<TE>   But Canada's lower prices also create a dilemma for U.S. shoppers.
Though it is also illegal to actually travel to Canada to buy drugs,
thousands of Americans do it every month, crossing from northern
border states such as Vermont and Michigan. Many Americans are
unaware that it's illegal to buy drugs from Canada over the Internet
and so they continue to search for deals. So how good are the
bargains to be had?</TE>
<TE>   I checked prices at Canadameds.com, which fills prescriptions at a
licensed pharmacy in Winnipeg. It offered a month's supply of
Celebrex, an arthritis drug, at $28.59 U.S.; Claritin, an allergy
drug, at $33.44; and Lipitor, a cholesterol drug, at $53.29. I
compared these prices to a number of U.S. Web sites in a random and
informal survey: The Canadian price for a month's supply of Celebrex
was $13.86 cheaper than the lowest U.S. price that I found. The
savings on Claritin was $38.75 a month. The Canadameds.com price for
Lipitor, $53.29, was virtually the same as the cheapest U.S. price.</TE>
<TE>   Even when consumers are confident they are dealing with legitimate
Web sites, careful shopping is required. With hundred of drugs
available, there are great variations in price. Don't assume that the
Internet will offer the cheapest prices; check prices at your local
pharmacies, which may have senior discounts, promotional discounts or
lower prices on some drugs.</TE>
<TE>   California consumers who are enrolled in Medicare (people older
than 65 and those who receive Social Security disability payments)
have another yardstick against which to measure Web prices. A state
law allows those people to buy drugs at the same discount the state
pays when it buys drugs for Medi-Cal, the health program for the
poor. If you are eligible, you can request the discount at the
drugstore. Some pharmacists and store managers may be unfamiliar with
the state discount program. (The list of the most popular drugs is
available through the California Department of Health Services, at
www.dhs.ca.gov.)</TE>
<TE>   I checked Internet prices for Celebrex (100-milligram tablet),
Claritin (10 milligrams) and Lipitor (10 milligrams), using a 30-day
supply of each drug as my yardstick. Celebrex was selling for $42.45
at Drugstore.com, $43.47 at YouRxPlan.com, $46.84 at Eckerds.com,
$47.45 at Walgreens.com and $47.79 at CVS.com. California's discount
price was $50.91.</TE>
<TE>   Claritin cost $72.19 at YouRxPlan.com, $75.87 at Eckerds.com,
$78.60 at Drugstore.com, $88.99 at CVS.com and $90.99 at
Walgreens.com. The state discount price was $93.47. Lipitor cost
$53.89 at YouRxPlan.com, $59.86 at Drugstore.com, $60 at Eckerds.com,
$64.99 at CVS.com and $65.99 at Walgreens.com. California paid $69.91
for the product.</TE>
<TE>   When surfing the Internet, consumers should also be cautious about
those e-mail messages from dubious operations that offer Viagra with
"no physical exam necessary" or diet pills that promise you will
"lose 8 to 12 pounds in two days--safely!" A Food and Drug
Administration investigation indicated there are as many as 400 sites
offering prescription drugs to consumers, roughly half of those in
the United States and half abroad. Many of them pose a potential
danger to consumers, William K. Hubbard, an FDA senior associate
commissioner, told a Senate Aging committee in July. These sites may
sell drugs that have expired, contaminated products or incorrect
doses, he cautioned.</TE>
<TE>   And some of the sites may be pure rip-offs that don't deliver any
drugs but run up unauthorized charges on customers' credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers can get a good deal from online pharmacies, but must
first make sure the vendor is legitimate. They should look for a
board of pharmacy seal of approval and for a site that asks for a
copy of a prescription. And they should compare Internet prices to
other discounts that may be available at brick-and-mortar pharmacies.</TE>

<HD>At Lab, It's a Good Day When the Lice Are Biting</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Few creatures are more disgusting to parents than head lice--and few
creatures demand more of the scientists who study them.</LD>
<LD>   Lice need human blood to live, which means researchers must
routinely walk around with little louse-filled tubes strapped to
their legs. When the creatures are hungry, they can crawl down and
bite the scientists' legs. (Understandably, louse research isn't very
popular.)</LD>
<LD>   The difficulty in maintaining louse colonies in labs has made it
hard for scientists to answer even the most elementary louse
questions--such as issues involving insecticide-resistance, or
whether kids can get head lice infestations from a few eggs on a
hairbrush or need closer contact with an infested playmate.</LD>
<TE>   Lice from "field trips" to schools are too variable.</TE>
<TE>   "If you pull lice off someone's head, you have no idea how old
they are, what stage of their life they're at, what they've been
treated with--it's just not a uniform population," says louse
researcher John Edman, director of the center for vector-borne
diseases at UC Davis</TE>
<TE>   Now, at last, comes a breakthrough: Researchers have developed an
automated system for the care and keeping of lice that allows them to
live without biting the scientists' legs.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how it works. The lice are placed in little containers,
along with tufts of human hair for that cozy, at-home feel. The
containers float on a reservoir of blood--obtained from a blood bank.
Floors of the containers consist of thin, artificial
membranes--stand-ins for human skin. When the lice get hungry, they
puncture the membrane and suck blood.</TE>
<TE>   The automated louse-rearer is helping researchers gather basic
information about the louse life cycle, says Miwa Takano Lee, a
post-doctoral researcher at UC Davis who helped develop the
contraption.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers have also started investigating the critter's
behavior--testing, for instance, how fast a louse can walk from one
tube to another, using a bridge of a single strand of hair.
Preliminary findings suggest that adult lice are speedy and
well-balanced whereas younger lice still in their early "nymph"
stages hardly go anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   If these findings hold up, it would suggest that a kid is pretty
unlikely to get infested from casual contact with hair containing
only nits and nymphs, Edman says. Thus, these kind of studies
(besides being morbidly fascinating) could help inform parents and
schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Currently, so little is known that many people are overly
cautious and paranoid," Lee says. "By presenting scientific evidence
we can try to reduce some hysteria."</TE>
<TE>   Other collaborators on the team are using the louse-rearing system
to nurture mutant lice that are resistant to common louse shampoos.
They are doing this for a noble, not nefarious, purpose.</TE>
<TE>   John Clark, professor of environmental toxicology at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst, and his graduate student
Kyong Yoon have been trying to learn where and how U.S. lice are
becoming resistant to permethrin, an insecticide commonly used in
head louse shampoos.</TE>
<TE>   They had some depressing news to report at the annual meeting of
the American Chemical Society last week: Tests of samples of lice
from different places revealed that resistant rates in some Los
Angeles schoolchildren is 50%. In the Texas population, the rate was
75% to 80%, and in one population in Florida, a whopping 98%.</TE>
<TE>   Clark and Yoon have also shown how that resistance is happening.
Permethrin and other so-called pyrethroid insecticides work by
interfering with a certain protein in the membrane of nerve cells.
Resistant lice have alterations in that protein that stop the
permethrin from doing its deed.</TE>
<TE>   Such lice exist naturally. But when populations are bombarded with
insecticides, they survive to reproduce while others perish.</TE>
<TE>   Yoon and Clark have designed a diagnostic test that makes it easy
to determine if a particular louse infestation is resistant--so that
other chemicals can be used and pyrethroids avoided altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Once the pyrethroids are gone, the resistant lice should soon die
out, says Clark. That's because, in the absence of permethrin,
resistant, mutant lice are less healthy than normal, susceptible
lice.</TE>
<TE>   The automated louse-rearer still needs perfecting. (Science fair
project, anyone?) Right now, animals can be gently reared from egg to
adulthood--but not beyond. The scientists hope that one day the
system will maintain whole colonies indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Lee occasionally must strap lice to her legs.</TE>
<TE>   "Until I have successfully reared several generations on the
apparatus," she pledges, "I will not stop."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the drawbacks of teeth-whitening procedures is that sometimes
teeth become sensitive, leading to discomfort while eating.</LD>
<LD>   But a recent study found that teeth that become touchy after the
first week of bleaching become less sensitive over the course of
treatment. And some people don't experience any extra sensitivity at
all, researchers found.</LD>
<LD>   The four-week study involved 100 men and women at the Naval
Medical Center in San Diego. People were prescribed a tooth-whitening
treatment to use at home and were custom-fitted with a mouth tray to
hold the whitening gel. Half of the group was given a 15% carbamide
peroxide and fluoride gel; the other half got a placebo--or
ineffective--gel. They were instructed to wear the gel-filled devices
for three to four hours a day.</LD>
<TE>   After the first week, about half of the volunteers in both groups
reported some mild sensitivity.</TE>
<TE>   However, the sensitivity diminished as treatment continued. After
four weeks, only 8% of those in the whitening-gel group reported mild
discomfort, compared with 6% of the placebo group.</TE>
<TE>   Four percent of those using the whitening gel reported severe
sensitivity after the first week, which caused them to avoid certain
foods. No one in either group had severe sensitivity after two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jorgensen, an associate professor of clinical dentistry at
the USC School of Dentistry, who collaborated with the Naval Medical
Center researchers, says people with receding gums are more likely to
experience sensitivity during whitening.</TE>
<TE>   Because mild sensitivity occurred in some of those using the
placebo gel, the researchers speculate that it's not only the
bleaching agent, but close contact with the gel itself, that caused
the initial problem. Another possible explanation is that people tend
to brush their teeth more vigorously when they participate in a
dental study.</TE>

<TE>   Is Your Child Acting Twitchy? Don't Worry, Researchers Say</TE>
<TE>   Repetitive twitches, shoulder shrugs, grimaces, eye-blinking and
other tics are the most common movement disorders in young children.
Understandably, parents who notice a tic are concerned, but
researchers have found that most tics eventually go away. And, the
researchers report, children with a tic are no more likely to have
behavior problems than other kids.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health studied
more than 500 healthy children, ranging in age from kindergarten to
sixth grade, by observing them for tics for eight months. In the
monthly observations, the researchers also looked for behaviors such
as irritability, inattention, anxiety, tension and impulsivity.
Teachers and parents were asked to report any tics or behavior
problems.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers report that about one in four children had at
least one movement in some part of their body. Eye-blinking was the
most common tic, affecting 68% of children with movement disorders.
Boys were twice as likely to have tics than girls and, for
unexplained reasons, tics were more common during the winter. In
about 6% of the children, the tics were present for more than three
months or showed up in two nonconsecutive months.</TE>
<TE>   For most children, however, these movements may be just a phase of
development that the nervous system is passing through, says Dr. Lisa
A. Snider, a study co-author and a clinical research fellow at the
NIMH in Bethesda, Md. Still, parents should check with a pediatrician
if they notice a repetitive movement.</TE>

<TE>   Bandage Sometimes Works as Well as Stitches, an ER Study Shows</TE>
<TE>   If you've ever gone to the emergency room with a badly cut finger
and asked, "Does this need stitches?" you may have wondered how the
doctor decided whether to suture the cut. Though not exactly
guesswork, your doctor's decision may have been based more on
experience than hard science.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at UC San Francisco decided to address this problem by
studying how patients with cuts less than an inch long fared when
some received stitches and some did not.</TE>
<TE>   Ninety-one people who came to the UCSF hospital emergency
department were randomly assigned to have their cuts either sutured
or not. All the patients were examined, and none had tendon or nerve
injuries, or excessive bleeding. Those with stitches had them removed
within eight to 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   Those who got stitches had more discomfort, of course, than those
who only had their wounds cleaned and an antibiotic ointment and
bandage applied. In all other measures of successful treatment,
however, there was little difference between them. The two groups
resumed normal activities at about the same time--in 3.4 days, on
average. There was only one infection, and that occurred in a person
who had stitches. Doctors evaluating the cosmetic appearance of the
healed wounds in photos taken three months later saw no significant
difference. And ratings of the wounds' appearance by the patients
themselves were similar.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers concluded that stitching a simple hand cut
provided no benefit. However, they caution, their results can't be
generalized to larger wounds or to other areas of the body.</TE>

<TE>   Can Eating Bananas Help Prevent Stroke?</TE>
<TE>   If you take a diuretic, consuming food rich in potassium such as
bananas, milk and green leafy vegetables may lower your risk of
stroke. Scientists have previously noted a connection between
potassium intake and death from stroke, but a new study adds to the
evidence linking low levels of the mineral to a greater risk of
stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers followed more than 5,600 participants in the
Cardiovascular Health Study, an ongoing study involving people from
four communities in California, Maryland, North Carolina and
Pennsylvania. When the study began, none of the men and women, who
were 65 or older, had suffered a stroke. Over the next four to eight
years, 473 strokes occurred among them.</TE>
<TE>   The study is the first to look at stroke risk in people who take
diuretics, drugs commonly prescribed to treat high blood pressure and
to help prevent strokes. The drugs are known to increase potassium
loss.</TE>
<TE>   Those who consumed the least potassium were 1.5 times more likely
to have a stroke, compared with those with the highest intake. Among
those taking diuretics, the risk of stroke was 2.5 times greater in
those who had low levels of potassium in their blood compared with
those with high levels.</TE>
<TE>   If the person taking diuretics with a low potassium level also had
an irregular heartbeat--a condition known as atrial fibrillation--the
risk of stroke increased 10 times compared with diuretic users with a
higher level of potassium and a normal heart rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   "Our study was the first to report this intriguing observation,
says Dr. Deborah M. Green, assistant clinical professor of medicine
at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu and a study co-author.
Because the study sampled a relatively small number of people with
the heart condition, a larger study is needed to confirm the
findings, she says.</TE>

<LD>Question: I enjoy a drink before dinner and a glass of wine during
dinner. I take the blood pressure medicine verapamil at bedtime. Are
there any interactions I should know about?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Verapamil (Calan, Isoptin, Verelan) increases blood
alcohol levels. This could magnify the effects of your drinks. If you
had to get up at night, you might be unsteady and fall.</LD>
<LD>   People often do not realize that many medicines may interact with
alcohol to produce unpleasant reactions. Acetaminophen, aspirin,
cimetidine (Tagamet), ibuprofen and diphenhydramine (Benadryl) are a
few drugs whose effects may be altered by alcohol.</LD>
<TE>   Q: I have found that applying antiperspirant to areas such as the
groin and under the breasts can prevent fungal infections and
itching, 90% of the time. My only concern is an e-mail rumor about
antiperspirants causing breast cancer. Should I worry?</TE>
<TE>   A: The fungi that cause jock itch and related problems thrive in
warm, moist places. When you use antiperspirant to prevent sweating,
you deprive these organisms of the moisture they love.</TE>
<TE>   Some dermatologists recommend applying antiperspirant to the feet
to prevent foot odor and athlete's foot. A double-blind study
conducted on more than 600 cadets at the U.S. Military Academy found
that those who used antiperspirant on their feet for three nights
before a long hike were less than half as likely to get blisters.</TE>
<TE>   Although the claim linking antiperspirants to breast cancer has
circulated widely on the Internet, there is no good science behind
it.</TE>
<TE>   Q: After a strenuous two-week walking tour of Europe, I got home
and began experiencing increasing numbness and tingling on the
bottoms of my feet.</TE>
<TE>   When I developed similar sensations in my hands, I sought help
from my orthopedist. Finding nothing to cause my symptoms, the
orthopedist sent me to a neurologist for tests, including a back MRI
looking for spinal stenosis. He ordered a nutritional analysis and
discovered that I suffered from vitamin B-6 toxicity.</TE>
<TE>   My multiple-vitamin supplement contains a lot more than the
recommended dietary allowance for several B vitamins. They are
supposed to be water-soluble, but somehow in my system, the B-6 built
up to toxic levels, causing the neuropathies. About a week after
discontinuing that supplement, the symptoms disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   A: Vitamin B-6 is known to cause nerve damage at high levels. Most
people tolerate doses up to 25 milligrams or even 50 milligrams a day
without trouble. The symptoms you describe (numbness and tingling in
the extremities) are typical of neuropathy.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>He was everyone's stereotype of a psychiatric patient, the "crazy"
person who could have stepped out of a bad Hollywood movie. Except
there he was, in the flesh, and in my hands.</LD>
<LD>   As a new resident in psychiatric medicine, I had seen doctors
approach patients with nothing but scientific detachment, as
fascinating specimens they could fix with the brilliant application
of the right chemicals. I was going to be different. I was going to
let my patients know that I cared about the human beings they really
were. And they were going to open up and tell me their secrets. At
least, that was my plan.</LD>
<LD>   This patient was tall and gaunt, with long pale hair and a beard
that grew in a wild mane around his head. He loped around the
psychiatric unit, muttering, sometimes yelling, mostly lost in his
own world. And those fingernails--long, sharp blades that had begun
to curl, stained yellow by cigarettes.</LD>
<TE>   He had suffered for years from schizophrenia. He was paranoid,
disorganized and delusional. Every medicine had been tried. He had
been thrown out of innumerable rest homes and group homes. He
threatened people and once had fractured a nurse's neck. They didn't
want him back. He lived in the hospital now.</TE>
<TE>   The first time we met, he didn't look at me, just furrowed his
thick eyebrows and spoke to an imaginary companion somewhere to my
left. He told me he was both a man and a woman. As a woman, he said,
he had been raped. Perhaps he had raped himself; he wasn't sure.</TE>
<TE>   I listened to the story, but he made little sense.</TE>
<TE>   One day, on the ward, he became angry with me. "What are you
trying to do to me?" he screamed, towering over me and pointing at my
face. "Nobody listens to me. Nobody understands me!"</TE>
<TE>   I want to understand you, I told him. I did the things we had been
taught about how to calm an agitated person: I stood at an angle, not
facing him directly; I spoke quietly without looking him in the eye.
And I summoned the nurses for help. Later, the head doctor commended
me on how I had "de-escalated" him.</TE>
<TE>   There must be better way of getting through to him, I thought. So
I brought the "woman" part of him a nail-care kit that I'd received
for Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   When I told him I was going to give him a manicure, he stopped
muttering. I showed him my kit. There was a clipper, a file, a buffer
and a cuticle trimmer.</TE>
<TE>   We sat down, and I took his hands. I clipped, filed, buffed and
trimmed. Looking me in the eyes, he began to tell me about his old
girlfriend. The story sounded as if it might have actually happened.</TE>
<TE>   I did his nails weekly. He was always relaxed during these
sessions, though in between he was as confused as ever. When I left
the unit, I gave him the nail kit as a gift. I figured he was doing
about as well as he ever would, and I moved on to my next rotation.</TE>
<TE>   Two months later I saw the resident who had taken on my former
duties. She struck me as detached, scientific. But she had good news.
My patient was on a different medication, one he'd tried briefly in
the past but which we had all been told hadn't worked. The new
resident had investigated and discovered that our information had
been poor. She pushed to try the medicine again.</TE>
<TE>   He was doing remarkably well. He had stopped hallucinating and no
longer threatened people. His thinking was more logically.</TE>
<TE>   A few months later, he was out of the hospital, living in a rest
home and attending a job program. He told his counselors that he felt
happy. He didn't talk about being a woman anymore. He looked people
in the eye and smiled. When I saw him again, his odd beard was gone,
his hair was short and neat. And he was taking care of his nails
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Why hadn't I tried him on that medicine? I was supposed to be good
at "connecting" with people, but that hadn't been enough in this
case.</TE>
<TE>   I had chosen to be his manicurist instead of his doctor.</TE>
<TE>   What he needed, I now realized, was a doctor who could objectively
analyze the facts--the science--without so much emotion.</TE>
<TE>   But I had become lost with him in his disease. Why? Because I
thought that I was so warm and caring, so human, that the sheer force
of my personality would make him well. This was the hardest part to
accept.</TE>
<TE>   I was no different from all those other doctors whom I had
criticized for caring about the cure instead of the person. They used
their science; I used my nail set. But we all wanted the glory of
solving the puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, of course, what really mattered was that someone had
been able to help him. For the longest time I couldn't forgive myself
that it had not been me.</TE>
<TE>   These days, I still try to treat my patients like human beings
instead of specimens. I just remind myself to step back and be a
doctor, sometimes, too.</TE>

<HD>The Latest Thinking on Ginkgo</HD>
<DH>A study questions the extract's reputation as a memory
helper. But some say researchers gave weak doses for too short a
time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaf extracts from one of the world's oldest trees, the ginkgo, can
be found in breakfast cereal, tea and tablets sold at supermarkets
and health food stores. Marketers claim it can help your memory, but
scientists don't agree on whether the herbal product can actually
give your brain a boost.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers have been studying ginkgo as a potential "smart drug"
for healthy people. They want to know if it improves memory skills or
slows the deterioration of mental skills among people with mild
cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease. They're also interested
in whether it can prevent disease altogether.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Assn.
raised new questions about benefits for healthy people. Researchers
found that a common brand of ginkgo did nothing to sharpen memory,
concentration or learning in healthy elderly volunteers--a blow to
the claims of some supplement companies that ginkgo can "enhance"
focus and improve memory in just weeks.</LD>
<TE>   But that's hardly the last word about a popular supplement with
annual worldwide sales of more than $500 million. The study was
sharply criticized by the supplement industry and some health
professionals, who contended that other U.S. and foreign studies have
demonstrated positive effects.</TE>
<TE>   The study compared more than 100 elderly volunteers who took 120
milligrams of ginkgo a day to a similar number of volunteers who took
a dummy pill. Neither the subjects nor researchers knew who got the
ginkgo. After six weeks, those who took the product, Ginkoba, scored
no better on 14 different tests of mental ability than the placebo
group.</TE>
<TE>   Steven H. Ferris, executive director of the Silberstein Institute
for Aging and Dementia at New York University, praised the study,
saying it realistically demonstrated the experience of people who
might purchase ginkgo and follow the label instructions.</TE>
<TE>   Some proponents of ginkgo criticized the study. Los Angeles
psychiatrist Hyla Cass, who often recommends ginkgo to patients
because of its potential antioxidant effects on the heart and brain,
said study subjects should have been given higher doses for longer
periods.</TE>
<TE>   However, researchers selected the dosage based on manufacturer
instructions and recommendations from Germany's Commission E, a
regulatory agency that reviews the effectiveness of herbal medicines,
said the study's lead author Paul R. Solomon, who also wanted to test
the manufacturer's claim of results in four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "One study never allows people to draw conclusions about how they
ought to behave in terms of their health," said Solomon, a
psychologist at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. and at the
Memory Clinic at Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington.
"On the other hand, we think this is the most rigorous study done to
date."</TE>
<TE>   Solomon, who conducts clinical trials of Alzheimer's medications,
became interested in ginkgo because some of his patients wondered if
it did any good.</TE>
<TE>   The answer is complicated. Many doctors report anecdotal
improvements among patients with memory complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Cott, former chief of the psychopharmacology research
program at the National Institute of Mental Health, wasn't surprised
Solomon didn't see effects on normal memory "because these effects
are very hard to find." But he noted that researchers Joseph A. Mix
of Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., and W. David Crews Jr. of
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg,
Va., have found improvements in healthy older subjects taking 180
milligrams daily for six weeks. They published those findings online
last month in the journal Human Psychopharmacology.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Lon Schneider, a USC professor of psychiatry, neurology and
gerontology, said he wished Solomon's study had measured how quickly
subjects processed information because that skill often declines
first in seniors. That skill improved among ginkgo recipients in the
Mix and Crews studies.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider said Solomon's study of healthy people excluded typical
ginkgo buyers, including those with some depression, anxiety, aches
and pains--in sum, "the people we all seem to know."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists continually debate published findings on ginkgo in
healthy and memory-impaired people. Ginkgo supporters cite a 1997
JAMA study that found some improvements in Alzheimer's patients;
critics say it didn't demonstrate significant benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider was the lead investigator in a 500-person study to
determine whether ginkgo can help people with mild to moderate
Alzheimer's. He declined to discuss the results because the data have
not yet been published, but said some may respond to ginkgo's
antidepressant and other effects.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Cott, a 56-year-old consulting research pharmacologist,
takes ginkgo daily: "I'm convinced by animal data, test-tube data and
human data that it's good for me, and it's going to help me down the
road."</TE>

<LD>Overview: Two college women and a registered dietitian join forces to
confront the problem of college weight gain. The book describes why
women often gain weight after leaving home and what they need to know
about food and nutrition.</LD>
<LD>   What works: There are lots of practical tips for eating healthy on
the tight budget of a college student. Because many college freshman
live in dormitories and eat cafeteria food, the book offers advice on
making good choices in the cafeteria line.</LD>

<LD>Question: Can you please advise as to what sports/exercises are best
for the inner thigh?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Try these exercises, which will actually firm all the
muscles in your hips and thighs.</LD>
<LD>   * Lunges: Stand with your legs together. Step out in front as far
as you can. Without leaning forward, bend your knees until your hips
are level with your knees. Push back to the starting position. Switch
legs. Do three sets of 10 repetitions.</LD>
<TE>   * Pull-in plies: Holding light hand weights, stand with your feet
at shoulder width and with your thighs, knees and toes rotated
slightly outward. Bend your knees. (Be sure your knees bend directly
over your second toes and lift your arches away from the floor.)</TE>
<TE>   Keeping your back upright, straighten your legs and slide your
right leg toward your left leg. As you slide your leg in, keep your
toes in contact with the floor until your heels touch. Return your
right leg to the starting position and slide in your left leg. Do
eight to 12 repetitions with each leg.</TE>
<TE>   * Weighted leg raises: Lie on your side, supporting your head with
your forearm. Extend your bottom leg and bend your top knee. Place
your top leg's foot in front of your bottom leg's calf. Place a 5-or
8-pound weight on the inner edge of your bottom foot.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly raise your bottom leg off the floor. Balance the weight on
your foot by keeping the foot flexed and your bottom leg parallel to
your top leg. Try not to allow your knee and toes of your bottom leg
to turn upward. Keep your shoulders and hips facing forward. Try two
sets of eight to 12 repetitions on each leg.</TE>
<TE>   Wide-legged squats: Standing, with your feet no more than
hip-distance apart and your abs in and your back straight, lower
yourself until your hips are just above your knees. As you come back
up, squeeze your glutes together. Do three sets of 15 reps.</TE>

<AU>JONATHAN FIELDING and VALERIE ULENE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the most difficult--and exciting--aspects of medicine is that
"the facts" are constantly changing. Peptic ulcer disease is a good
example of this evolution.</LD>
<LD>   For decades, medical students were taught that stress and dietary
factors, such as spicy foods, caused most ulcers. Patients were put
on bland diets and instructed to rest and eliminate stress from their
lives. This approach did provide some relief from the abdominal pain
and nausea, but it rarely cured the ulcers themselves.</LD>
<LD>   Next, the focus turned to stomach acids. These fluids not only
break down food but erode the delicate lining of the stomach as well.
Several drugs were developed to counter this effect. Some reduced the
production of stomach acid; others created a protective barrier
between acid and the stomach lining. These medications caused a great
deal of excitement because most ulcers healed rapidly and completely
when patients took them.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, as soon as the drugs were stopped, many of the
ulcers recurred--even those that had healed completely. For some
people, the only way to keep new ulcers from developing was to stay
on the drugs permanently.</TE>
<TE>   But Australian researchers recognized the real reason these ulcers
recurred. About 20 years ago, they began to find bacteria called
Helicobacter pylori (or H. pylori) in the stomachs of so many ulcer
patients that they suspected the bacteria of causing ulcers. It did
not take long for them to prove their theory correct. And so it is
that today's medical students are taught that H. pylori is the
principal factor for most ulcer disease. (Studies suggest that the
bacteria play a role in more than 80% of all ulcer cases.)</TE>
<TE>   Outside the medical field, few people are aware of the connection
between H. pylori and ulcers. A survey reported by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in the late 1990s found that only 27%
of people were aware of this relationship. About 60% still believed
that ulcers were caused by stress; 17% believed that spicy foods
caused ulcers.</TE>
<TE>   So what is H. pylori and how does it cause ulcers? For starters,
it's a unique bacteria, because it can survive in the stomach despite
the high acid levels there. It's also very common. In the United
States, approximately 20% of people under the age of 40 and half of
those older than 60 harbor the bacteria in their stomachs, according
to recent estimates. In most of these people, the bacteria do not
cause any symptoms; in fact, most people never know they are
infected.</TE>
<TE>   The most common problem caused by H. pylori infection is the
development of an ulcer in the lining of the stomach or duodenum (the
portion of the small intestine closest to the stomach). It is
believed that the ulcer develops because the bacteria weakens the
protective barrier of mucus that normally lines the inside of the
stomach wall. This, in turn, allows stomach acids to penetrate the
mucus layer and irritate the stomach wall itself.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has a stomach ulcer should be tested for H. pylori
infection. The infection can be diagnosed in several ways, including
a blood test and a breath test. The blood test measures antibodies to
the bacteria; the breath test detects a substance in expelled air.
The diagnosis can also be made by obtaining a biopsy of the stomach
lining and studying the tissue under a microscope for the presence of
this bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   Once infection has been documented in a person with an ulcer,
every attempt to eliminate the bacteria should be made. Successfully
treating the infection can speed ulcer healing and dramatically
reduce the risk of recurrences. Unfortunately H. pylori is stubbornly
resistant, and two weeks of treatment with three or four medications
are usually required to achieve success. The regimen typically
includes antibiotics, as well as bismuth (Pepto-Bismol) or drugs that
inhibit stomach acid production.</TE>
<TE>   Even the most effective drug combinations fail to work about 10%
of the time. (Taking all of the medications for the prescribed period
of time is critical to success; stopping the drugs early can allow
the bacteria to survive and become resistant to them.)</TE>
<TE>   For some people, the story of H. pylori and ulcers serves as an
excuse for questioning anything doctors learn in medical school. We
prefer to look at it another way: It proves that good scientists--and
good doctors--never stop questioning, and never stop learning.</TE>

<LD>In the past, testing for H. pylori  bacteria has not generally been
recommended for people without ulcers, even if they suffer from
"dyspepsia" (upper abdominal pain or discomfort that typically occurs
on an empty stomach or with meals and is frequently confused with
ulcer symptoms). However, this view is changing, and many physicians
now recommend testing individuals with dyspepsia and treating those
who test positive. Although--for unknown reasons--treatment will make
only about 10% of them feel better, eliminating the bacteria could
reduce the risk of serious long-term consequences of infection such
as ulcers and stomach cancer (a rare but serious complication of H.
pylori infection).</LD>

<HD>Fidgety Child? Check for Apnea</HD>
<DH>Disorder* Pediatricians advise screening preschoolers for
the breathing problem, marked by snoring and restless sleep.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILARY WALDMAN</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sleep apnea is a disorder that causes a person to stop breathing
several times an hour during sleep. Though an estimated 18 million
adults are thought to have the condition, it is often overlooked in
children.</LD>
<LD>   But it is not uncommon.</LD>
<LD>   The American Academy of Pediatrics estimates that 2% of children
experience sleep apnea, most commonly during the preschool years. The
organization of 55,000 children's health specialists became so
concerned about the disorder that in April it issued treatment
guidelines to its members.</LD>
<TE>   Among the suggestions was that pediatricians screen all of their
young patients for snoring.</TE>
<TE>   Loud breathing and restless sleep are two warning signs of sleep
apnea.</TE>
<TE>   Nicky Ochs had always been a loud and restless sleeper, and his
mother remembers listening to his snoring through the closed bedroom
door.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back, there were some other hints that Nicky's nighttime
breathing was not normal, but nobody ever put the pieces together. At
5, the East Granby, Conn., boy was small for his age and always a bit
pale. He never slept through the night and sometimes wet the bed.</TE>
<TE>   When his mother, Rosemary, was told he suffered from sleep apnea,
it all began to make sense.</TE>
<TE>   "I had heard of sleep apnea in adults, but it didn't dawn on me,"
Ochs said. "We just thought he was a loud breather."</TE>
<TE>   Healthy children should breathe silently during sleep, said Dr.
James S. Batti, a pediatric ear, nose and throat specialist at
Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford. About 5% to 10% of
healthy children do snore but do not have sleep apnea, he noted.</TE>
<TE>   Other clues that a child may have sleep apnea include pauses in
breathing during sleep, a blue tinge around the sleeping child's eyes
and lips, growth delays, bed-wetting and hyperactive or inattentive
behavior during the day.</TE>
<TE>   "If there are none of these other signs, it could just be
snoring," Batti said.</TE>
<TE>   Though nobody is sure exactly how many children in the United
States have sleep apnea, Batti said apnea is the leading reason for
surgical removal of the tonsils and adenoids. Each year, more than
263,000 children have tonsillectomies, according to data from the
National Center for Health Statistics.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is common in children with enlarged tonsils in the
back of the throat and adenoids in the back of the nasal passage. The
tonsils and adenoids are part of the lymphatic system and help the
body fight infection, but often they cause more trouble than they're
worth.</TE>
<TE>   When a child reaches deep levels of sleep, the airway relaxes,
allowing enlarged adenoids to block the nasal passages. If large
tonsils fall into the back of the throat, breathing can be
obstructed.</TE>
<TE>   Although sleep apnea is usually more annoying than dangerous,
children can suffer serious consequences, including enlargement of
the right side of the heart if the condition is severe and untreated.
The enlargement can subside after tonsil and adenoid removal, Batti
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sleep apnea also may contribute to problems with school
performance, although further study is needed, said Dr. Carl E. Hunt,
director of the National Center on Sleep Disorder Research, part of
the National Institutes of Health.</TE>
<TE>   Hunt, a pediatrician by training, said one reason apnea has been
so underdiagnosed in children is that, unlike adults, children whose
sleep is interrupted by breathing lapses are not excessively drowsy
during the day. Instead, he said, sleep-deprived children may be
overly fidgety or active, possibly causing parents or teachers to
mistakenly suspect attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder.</TE>
<TE>   While the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a formal sleep
study to diagnose sleep apnea, Batti said parental reporting and an
examination of the throat are usually enough to confirm the problem.</TE>
<TE>   If parents are uncertain, Batti might recommend that they video or
tape-record their sleeping children.</TE>
<TE>   Nicky's tonsils were so large that his parents often wondered how
he swallowed, even when they had no idea that the tonsils were
interfering with his breathing during sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Last March, Batti removed Nicky's tonsils and adenoids. Ochs said
she noticed the results within days. His breathing became so silent
that it scared her. She would watch his chest rise and fall to make
sure he was alive.</TE>
<TE>   Within months, the pale, scrawny boy gained 11 pounds. Now 6 and
entering first grade, he has rosy cheeks and he no longer wets the
bed.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a changed child," Ochs said.</TE>

<LD>Last week, cardiologists at a prominent Arizona clinic began advising

before been used to treat heart disease. It's not just any

products is reassuring to many patients. After all, the guidance is
coming from graduates of some of our best medical schools, not
holistic gurus or health food store clerks.</LD>
<LD>   But there's a catch. The Arizona Heart Institute has struck a deal
with the supplement's maker, Vital Living, that gives the clinic a
share in profits from sales of the supplement, as well as 1 million
shares of stock options in the company.</LD>
<TE>   Although Heart Institute officials say the clinic's 29
cardiologists will not benefit from product sales, the deal and
others like it are raising eyebrows among some others in the
profession. At a time when nutritional supplements are one of the
most contentious issues in medicine, these critics say, doctors'
arrival in the marketplace threatens to undermine the objectivity of
one profession that might help consumers sort through the maze of
conflicting claims and incomplete science.</TE>
<TE>   "Having a financial interest in a product, however indirect, sets
up an inherent bias," said Dr. Wallace Sampson, professor emeritus at
Stanford University School of Medicine and editor of The Scientific
Review of Alternative Medicine. "It's just human nature; you want the
product or approach to work out, and that affects your judgment."</TE>
<TE>   Long gone are the days when a few maverick doctors, such as Andrew
Weil and diet guru Robert Atkins, were among the few voices touting
the health benefits of vitamins, minerals and herbs. The Arizona
Heart Institute effort illustrates the growing involvement of
mainstream medicine in the $18-billion-a-year dietary supplement
business.</TE>
<TE>   This change in doctors' attitudes has not escaped the attention of
the supplement companies, which are wooing physicians in hopes that
they will then sell or recommend their products to patients.
Borrowing tactics from the pharmaceutical business, supplement makers
are taking doctors to lunch, sending them free product samples and
inviting them to "educational" seminars at resort destinations.
Supplement sales by doctors have increased about tenfold since 1997,
to nearly $200 million in 2001, according to a recent survey by
Nutritionbusiness.com, an Internet-based firm that tracks the
supplement industry. While no one keeps specific figures, industry
executives estimate that about 20,000 U.S. doctors are pitching
supplements, more than double the number that were in the business
five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the fastest-growing areas in the entire dietary
supplement industry," said Anthony Almada, founder of Imaginutrition,
a Laguna Niguel consulting firm that advises supplement companies on
product-testing.</TE>
<TE>   While consumers have been swallowing vitamins and other
supplements for decades, many doctors paid scant attention to the
phenomenon until 1993, when a Harvard Medical School researcher
reported that 34% of American consumers had used some form of
unconventional medicine, which included everything from herbal
remedies to acupuncture to spiritual healing.</TE>
<TE>   Now doctors, like their patients, read reports almost daily about
new research findings on nutrition and health. Dozens of large,
federally funded trials have been completed on nutritional and herbal
supplements; and some prestigious medical schools, including Harvard
and Stanford, have established complementary medicine programs.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, many physicians say the marketing claims of the supplement
industry are outrunning the research. Federal regulators have cracked
down on some supplement makers for false advertising, and many
doctors still consider the field to be more snake oil than sound
science.</TE>
<TE>   "People need to understand that some supplements are appropriate
for certain people; but many are taken needlessly," said Judith
Stern, a professor of nutrition and internal medicine at UC Davis.
"When a doctor begins endorsing or selling supplements it puts his or
her signature on the products, and I think it begins to legitimize
everything, the entire supplement field."</TE>
<TE>   It's one thing for a doctor to send a patient at risk for
osteoporosis to a market for calcium pills, or send someone at risk
of heart disease for omega-3 fatty acid, or fish oil, supplements.
There's good evidence that those supplements can reduce the risk of
disease in many people, researchers say, and they're widely available
at pharmacies and grocery stores.</TE>
<TE>   It's another thing altogether, Stern said, for a doctor to sell
patients a list of vitamins, herbs and other formulations for which
the science is murky or nonexistent. In just the past few months, for
example, large trials of vitamins C and E (for heart disease,
cancer), and ginkgo (memory loss) have come up negative: the
supplements did no better than dummy pills in improving people's
health or function. Doctors in the supplement business commonly sell
these nutrients, in a variety of different blends and combinations,
and each recipe behaves differently in the body.</TE>
<TE>   That's a critical point. Although some ingredients themselves may
be well researched, most specific product formulations are not,
experts say. "About 99% of the products out there have no human
studies backing them up," Almada said. "None."</TE>
<TE>   The American Medical Assn. has raised ethical questions about
in-office sales of health related products, for this and other
reasons. In the AMA's opinion, the sales can present a financial
conflict of interest which undermines the doctor-patient
relationship, said Dr. Leonard Morse, chairman of the AMA's council
on ethics and judicial affairs. "The patient may think, 'If I don't
buy this, the doctor will be upset with me, and it may interfere with
my care,' " Morse said.</TE>
<TE>   Cardiologists at the Arizona Heart Institute will not sell
products out of their offices, the clinic said. They will recommend
the product to patients, who can call an 800 number and order it
straight from Vital Living, for $49 a month. Only the clinic's
founder and owner, Dr. Edward Diethrich, stands to benefit directly.</TE>
<TE>   Diethrich said the supplement contains ingredients that have been
shown to be safe and effective in improving cardiovascular health:
omega-3 fatty acids, niacin, and folic acid among them. In a study
published this April, for instance, Italian research reported that
omega-3 fatty acid supplements significantly reduced the risk of
sudden death in people who'd previously suffered a heart attack. "Our
patients look to us for advice on supplement usage," said Diethrich,
"and we want to provide them with credible information and options
that complement their heart care."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors who do sell supplements from their office make the same
point: Their patients want credible guidance. This is especially true
today, when about 80 million Americans are regular or occasional
supplement users, said Kent Holtorf, a family physician in Torrance
who dispenses a range of dietary supplements to his patients.
Providing products from the office enables a doctor to control what
patients take, and to make sure the regimen doesn't interfere with
any medications they might be on, these doctors say.</TE>
<TE>   "If I tell a patient to go buy products at the store, I have no
idea what they're getting, how good the product is, or whether
they'll get it at all," Holtorf said. "If I provide the products, I
know my patients are getting the very best there is, and they're much
more likely to use them properly."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ron Rothenberg, who runs a preventive medicine clinic in San
Diego, acknowledges that the science is mixed for many nutritional
and herbal products. Rothenberg views them as a kind of health
insurance. "These are things that cause little or no side effects,
when used as advised, and we have good reasons to believe they
protect against disease," he said. Many family doctors, internists
and other general practitioners feel the same way, and these are the
kind of physicians most likely to get financially involved in selling
supplements, said Jeffrey Bland, president of Metagenics, a San
Clemente-based firm that is one of the largest supplement suppliers.
Although younger MDs who have been more exposed to the study of
complementary medicine occasionally sell supplements to patients,
most customers are experienced doctors looking to change their
approach to patient care, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "These are doctors in their 50s, in their prime, who've paid off
their school loans, and decide that the things they learned in
medical school aren't working that well," Bland said. "This business
offers them a different way to interact with their patients, and
often re-energizes them."</TE>
<TE>   It's also a way to re-energize a physician's profits. Some doctors
who sell supplements, Bland says, have become discouraged by the
influence of managed care and government health programs that have
steadily eroded the fees they receive for treating patients. If
patients are going to use supplements anyway, some doctors figure,
why not get advice from an MD instead of a clerk at the local health
food store--and make a little extra money as well.</TE>
<TE>   There's little doubt that patients, armed with newspaper articles
and information pulled off the Internet, are peppering doctors with
questions about supplements. Maureen Cologne, 54, a high school
counselor from Rancho Palos Verdes, found Holtorf's office after many
years of searching for an effective treatment for chronic joint pain
and fatigue. "I went from doctor to doctor, and they would just do a
few blood tests, prescribe a pill, and that was it; it was getting me
nowhere," she said. She now takes about 12 supplement pills a day,
including omega-3 fatty acids and feels much better. "I used to crash
about 2 p.m. every day," she said. "Now I don't."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors like Holtorf see such improvement as evidence that
supplements are the wave of the future, not a passing phenomenon.
"Five years from now," he said, "the AMA will be recommending the
same stuff we're using right now."</TE>
<TE>   Millions of consumers don't want to wait. Bree Walker, a former
Los Angeles television news anchor who now runs a production company,
has been taking a variety of products under the guidance of
Rothenberg to build bone strength and maintain overall health. "I may
be spending my money to produce expensive urine, but I'm willing to
take that chance," she said. "The Baby Boomers I hang with are all
concerned with staying young and healthy, and this may very well
help. We are the first generation of guinea pigs, really."</TE>
<TE>   That's why doctors' objectivity and independence are so important,
said Stern, the UC Davis researcher. The more physicians get
financially entangled with supplement companies, the more likely
consumers are to act on faith rather than evidence, she said. Some
will make the right choices, like those who began consuming more
omega-3 fatty acid supplements years ago. Others could do themselves
harm. "Right now it's still a big uncontrolled experiment," Stern
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Arizona Heart Institute plans to proceed with its experiment
slowly. Though it originally announced plans to recommend its
supplement to about 175,000 patients, the clinic has decided to start
with a group of about 60, and see how they respond. "We're very
confident it's going to help patients," said Ken Lind, president of
Vital Living, the supplement's maker. "This product was designed by
physicians."</TE>

<DL>PANAMA CITY</DL>
<LD>A warm breeze blows off the Bay of Panama, caressing the city with a
woman's warm touch. I sit on a veranda of an outdoor restaurant atop
the seven-story Costa del Sol Hotel, feeling the breeze and watching
the twilight come. And I wonder, what could I have been thinking?</LD>
<LD>   I mean, I knew the canal was here and I knew we had to boot Manuel
Noriega out with loud blasts of rock 'n' roll, and I knew the U.S.
had returned function of the ocean to ocean waterway to Panama. But
beyond that, I was pretty ignorant of the country before I suggested
to my adventuresome wife, Cinelli, that we go there.</LD>
<LD>   Someone once said that God created wars to teach geography to
Americans, which is pretty much true. But since there haven't been
any, well, official wars in Central America for a while, the
conditions here haven't been impressed upon me. So why did I say to
my wife as we were discussing vacation possibilities, "How about
Panama?" I don't know.</LD>
<TE>   Cinelli, who will go anyplace in the world despite distance and
dangers, immediately agreed that it would be a sensational place to
go, because there were rain forests and jaguars and monkeys and maybe
crocodiles</TE>
<TE>   "Crocodiles? In Panama?"</TE>
<TE>   "Something like that. Caymans, I guess. And the fer-de-lance,
which is a snake."</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's a snake," I said, visualizing a serpent dropping from
a tree on to my head or striking out of the thick, green hell.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, good. Then you probably also know that a jaguar is an animal
and not a car. At least not here. In Beverly Hills maybe, yes, but
not in the rain forests. So it's off to Panama, si?"</TE>
<TE>   "I guess."</TE>
<TE>   This is an unexpected country, a place of tall buildings and
jungles, of wealth and desperate poverty. Indians still live in the
rain forests which, though within an hour or so driving distance,
seem like another world. Their history goes back 11,000 years, and
much of how they exist today is rooted in that dream time before
human memory.</TE>
<TE>   We booked our tour through Gray Line. I found it on the Internet,
prices and all, and then went looking for books on Panama. I bought
three, but the only one I really needed was in the Lonely Planet
series. It wasn't until later that I realized I knew the author,
Scott Doggett.</TE>
<TE>   Buying the book told me much about Panama's history and culture,
not to mention the location of some incredibly good restaurants, but
you have to actually be in the country to even begin to understand
it. I've only been here a beat and a half, but already I love it.</TE>
<TE>   While stereotypes are always dangerous, Cinelli and I have found
the people to be friendly, helpful and generous, and that's not just
at the hotel. We've managed to function despite a language barrier,
due to the kindness of strangers. I suppose they could be muttering
"Stupido Americanos" under their breath, but they smile when they're
saying it, so who cares?</TE>
<TE>   When they hear my name, they are dumbfounded that I don't speak
Spanish, and no amount of explaining satisfies their confusion. So I
shrug and grin stupidly and say, "I dunno," the way they'd do in the
U.S. if they didn't speak English. One or two practiced the ancient
technique of shouting at me to help me understand, but that doesn't
work here any better than it does in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Panama City, with a population of about half a million, is as
sophisticated as any large city we've visited ... and as busy. One
can get just about anywhere in a taxi for $2 or $3, whether it's to
the canal, old town, the French plaza with its incredible eating
places or any number of museums.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic is unbelievably heavy, and cabdrivers consider it a game
to go from Point A to Point B without dying. They miss other cars and
vans and buses not by inches, but by the microscopic methods that
scientists employ in measuring the sizes of spores on rat hairs. I
would guess that the mortality rate of tourists is greater in traffic
than in the jungle. It has been said, for instance, that to a cab
driver, stop signs are only suggestions.</TE>
<TE>   Weather is a part of the total experience in Panama, where in the
mountains of San Blas it is said to rain as much as 100 inches in a
year. As I sit overlooking the city now, the darkening sky is mostly
clear and a full moon is visible between strands of clouds. But one
can still sense the presence of rain in the humid air. And when it
comes, it comes with flashes of lightning and roars of thunder that
shake the very sky.</TE>
<TE>   We will be in Panama for another week, and much remains to be seen
in this magic country. I feel comfortable here, which is rare,
because I don't usually feel comfortable anywhere. An eight-hour ride
through the canal from the Pacific to the Atlantic was the
technological equivalent of climbing to the top of a pyramid. The
canal represents that kind of achievement.</TE>
<TE>   Tomorrow, it's off to the jungles, in which my comfort, I fear,
will be severely tested. Cinelli is electrified by the prospect. I
remain, as usual, cautious.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Forty years ago, the birth-control pill freed women from fear of
pregnancy and gave them the ability to engage in spontaneous,
uninterrupted sexual intercourse. So it is somewhat ironic that
recent research has found that for a minority of women, the pill has
the unintended and surprising effect of diminishing sexual desire.</LD>
<LD>   According to a review of research on the adverse behavioral
effects of oral contraceptives published recently in the journal
Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality, nearly a third of American women
who begin using oral contraceptives stop within three months.</LD>
<LD>   Review author Cynthia Graham of the Kinsey Institute for Research
in Sex, Gender and Reproduction, said that among the reasons women
say they stop taking the pill are dampened sexual interest, emotional
volatility, physical side effects, forgetting to take the pill and
the end of a relationship.</LD>
<TE>   "There is this long-held assumption in the medical literature that
the pill will increase sexual desire," said Graham, a clinical
assistant professor of gender studies and psychiatry, who has been
investigating the behavioral side effects of the pill since the early
1990s. "But there is a subgroup of women who experience these
negative sexual side effects, and we think that we should find out
why that is."</TE>
<TE>   Research into the adverse sexual side effects of the pill has been
greatly neglected, said Graham. "When one considers the millions of
women who take the pill worldwide and the fact that the pill has been
around for four decades, it is outrageous. In contrast, there is
already research being done on possible side effects of the male
contraceptive pill, which is still in the developmental phase."</TE>
<TE>   With a paucity of data, Graham and other researchers claim there
is no way to predict which women are likely to be more susceptible to
the pill's adverse effects on mood and sexuality, or which oral
contraceptive formulas might bear more responsibility for the
negative effects.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't find any good demographic predictors such as mood
before starting the pill or sexual experience variables," said
Graham. In another study published a year ago in the journal
Contraception, Kinsey Institute researchers found that the best
predictors of discontinuation of oral contraception among 80 women
(who were 18 years and older and in committed, sexually active
relationships) was dampened sexual interest and an increase in
emotional volatility. About 87% of the women who stopped taking oral
contraception did so reportedly because of a decrease in spontaneous
sexual thoughts, less frequent intercourse, difficulties with sexual
arousal and negative mood change, according to the study.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have had a difficult time teasing out whether the
effect is due to pill-induced hormonal fluctuations or because of
emotional volatility. "We looked at the relationship between mood and
sexuality in an earlier paper and it's not that the two are not
related but they do seem to be separable," said Graham.</TE>
<TE>   To find out how oral contraceptives might be affecting the mood
and sexuality of women, a 1995 double-blind, placebo-controlled study
examined the effects of low-dose oral contraceptives on 150 women
living in two different countries. Half of the women lived in the
Philippines, and the other half in Scotland. The women had been
sterilized or had partners who'd had vasectomies. Women were assigned
either a placebo, or a combined oral contraceptive (which contains
synthetic estrogen and synthetic progesterone) or a progesterone-only
contraceptive (which contains only synthetic progesterone, less
commonly used).</TE>
<TE>   The women took the pill for four months, during which behavioral
effects were assessed through self-ratings of sexual function
(frequency of sex, spontaneous sexual desire and enjoyment of sexual
activity), and responded to surveys about the quality of their
marriage and questionnaires about their mood and menstrual cycle.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve of the 25 Scottish women taking the combined oral
contraceptive reported reduced sexual interest and less frequent sex,
according to the study. But the combined oral contraceptive did not
have the same effect on the Filipino women. There were no adverse
effects on mood or sexuality among any of the women taking the
progesterone-only pill.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers explain that differences in behavioral effects might
be related to the different ways the two groups of women felt about
sexual relationships, generally.</TE>
<TE>   In baseline assessments taken by the researchers before the women
started taking the pills, the majority of Scottish women described
initiating lovemaking, feeling close and comfortable with their mate,
maintaining high sexual interest and generally enjoying sexual
activity. Conversely, the Filipino women were less likely to initiate
sex, had less sexual interest and felt less close and less
comfortable with partners during sexual relationships before taking
the pill.</TE>
<TE>   "The [Filipino] women did not become more sexual when on the
pill," said Graham, who added that cultural differences likely had an
impact. "There was no evidence of a positive effect on their
sexuality. They didn't have much scope from the baseline for a
negative effect to be found. We were also looking at a different
cultural group, and the women said it was hard to talk about the
subject of sex with the interviewers."</TE>
<TE>   It has long been believed that progestogens have a negative effect
on sexual interest, said Graham. For example, synthetic progesterones
are used to treat sexual offenders, she said.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible that the combined-oral contraceptives impact on
sexual interest may have something to do with a reduction of
testosterone, which is often assumed to be the main hormone
correlated with maintaining a healthy libido in women as well as men.</TE>
<TE>   But it is difficult to isolate what parts of a squashed libido are
due to side effects of oral contraceptives, to normal waning of
sexual interest in long-term relationships or other causes. "Libido
in women is very complex but with men it is like a switch," said Dr.
Andrea Rapkin, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UCLA
School of Medicine. "I have heard this complaint about decreased
sexual interest from patients on the pill."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers such as Graham hope that physicians, clinicians and
women themselves will consider the pill as a possible culprit when
there is loss of sexual desire. "We don't assume that women coming to
see us with complaints of decreased sexual interest are on the pill,
but if you take a careful history from a woman, then adverse effects
from the pill might be explored," said Graham who is also a certified
sex therapist.</TE>
<TE>   "Our point is that this issue should not be ignored and that it
warrants research. Clinically, I have seen women come off the pill
and notice an improvement in their sexual desire. That is what drives
this research, the belief that it is clinically significant."</TE>

<LD>LORD MINIMUS</LD>
<LD>   The Extraordinary Life</LD>
<LD>   of Britain's Smallest Man</LD>
<TE>   By Nick Page</TE>
<TE>   St. Martin's</TE>
<TE>   262 pages, $16.95</TE>
<TE>   You can see the diminutive courtier in portraitist Anthony van
Dyck's 1633 masterpiece "Queen Henrietta Maria With Jeffrey Hudson
and an Ape," recently on display at the Huntington Library, Art
Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino. The devoted wife of
King Charles I, who would lose his head in the English civil war,
Henrietta Maria surrounded herself with pets, exotic and domestic,
animal and human. Jeffrey Hudson was her favorite dwarf.</TE>
<TE>   British writer Nick Page, who tells Jeffrey's story in "Lord
Minimus," probes the picture for clues: "Henrietta Maria is dressed
in blue satin, which shimmers with light. She stares straight ahead,
confident, calm, one hand resting gently on her pet monkey. She is
informal, but in control....[Jeffrey's] clothes are of a deep scarlet
velvet ... his boots have spurs on them. If these were his real
clothes--and there seems no reason to doubt it--he was riding and
hunting by the time he was fourteen.... [I]n this portrait Jeffrey is
a pet. He looks up anxiously at his royal mistress.... Like Pug the
monkey, Jeffrey is in thrall. He may be sumptuously clothed, he may
be skilled at hunting, he may have all the accouterments of a
courtier, but he still has no will of his own....Yet he is not
unhappy. There is anxiety in his eyes, but not fear and not
unease.... All his energy is focused outwards, towards his mistress.
He loves her and she loves him. But their love is not, and never
would be, equal."</TE>
<TE>   If little is known about Hudson, that little is intensely
dramatic. His rise from obscurity to fame begins in 1626, with
7-year-old, 18-inch Jeffrey concealed in a pie as a surprise present
for the queen. And there are still more surprising turns in the years
to come, with Hudson taking part in the English civil war, killing a
man in a duel, being captured by pirates, sold into slavery and
imprisoned. Page's appendices feature two brief nonfiction accounts
of Hudson's life written in the later part of the 17th century, as
well as a more fanciful cameo of him that appears in one of Sir
Walter Scott's novels.</TE>
<TE>   Opting for fact rather than fiction, Page reconstructs Hudson's
life and times. Since he left no letters or diaries, Page fleshes out
his story by summoning up the world in which he existed: the poverty
and filth in which most people lived, the lavishness of the royal
court, the perils of sea travel, the dangers of war and the tensions
between Catholics and Protestants, the royal court and the rest of
the country and between parliament and a king who sincerely believed
he ruled by divine right.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the paucity of information about Hudson, Page manages to
provide us with some sense of his character: He was witty, charming,
courtly, a skilled horseman and a keen shot, and even took some part
in military action (on the royalist side, of course). Tired of being
the subject of teasing and mockery, he challenged one of his mockers
to a duel with pistols and killed him. Ironically, Page reflects,
Hudson's act of self-assertion would cost him everything. Exiled by
the queen, he was captured at sea by the dreaded Barbary pirates and
spent the second 25 years of his life as a slave in North Africa. By
the time he was able to return to England in 1669, the world he had
known was all but vanished.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible to find in any past age "a distant mirror" of our
own times. The Barbary pirates, notes Page, "were the terrorists of
their day, guerrilla seafarers ... [T]he one thing that might have
stopped the pirates--a combined effort on the part of the European
powers--was impossible to achieve. Indeed, instead of working
together to prevent the piracy, the consuls of various
nations--notably England and France--spent their time persuading the
Barbary states to break peace with their rivals. Since the pirate
states never respected any treaty in the first place, this was
something of a redundant effort ... " Nor was their case strengthened
by the fact that the European powers also practiced piracy when it
suited them.</TE>
<TE>   One may also find a parallel between the Carolingian court's
passion for entertainments known as masques and our own era's
preference for visual effects over intelligent discourse. Where only
a generation or two earlier English theater meant Shakespeare or Ben
Jonson, by the time of Charles I, Jonson himself was reduced to
writing masques and railing against his collaborator, the architect
and set designer Inigo Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' technical virtuosity was dazzling: storms with thunder and
lightning, roiling oceans, white clouds from which goddesses or
angels descended onto the stage. But the taste for special effects
went side by side with a disdain for intellectual content. This
preference for gaudy spectacle was sadly characteristic of Charles
I's court. Page observes: "With ... his foreign policy in tatters and
his coffers empty, faced with the need to manage a Parliament that
would be bitter, resentful and out for revenge, Charles did what he
was best at. He held a masque." For the doomed, inflexible, but
well-meaning king, masques helped mask reality.</TE>
<TE>   In "Lord Minimus," one is reminded, alas, of our current fashions
in films, of the photo ops and sound bites that are edging out
political discourse (not to mention the ritualistic round of forums
and conferences where our modern rulers make a show of addressing
problems). Page's colorful account of one of history's minor players
helps expand our understanding of the past and present alike.</TE>

<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Sarah Gray Miller's rolled-to-mid-calf jeans are from Goodwill. Her
red-and-white side-tie blouse is from Express. Her watch is from
Wal-Mart.</LD>
<LD>   The two mint-green visitor's chairs opposite her desk were $5,
lawn chairs in a former life that she stripped and painted. Her desk
was $100 at a junk shop. She plucked the end table from garbage in
Brooklyn.</LD>
<LD>   The iBook laptop is the most expensive item in her office.</LD>
<TE>   Gray emphatically sprinkles bargain information throughout her
conversation. Mention you like her hat, and it prompts: "One dollar
from Salvation Army!" She has a knack for making other people's junk
look cool.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, 31, embodies the spirit of Budget Living, the new magazine
of which she is editor in chief. So does her staff. The magazine's
23rd-floor office at Madison Avenue and 42nd Street is like a
shabby-chic art gallery. There is a light green distressed fireplace
frame with a similar colored table in the open conference area. It's
surrounded by chairs swathed in white slipcovers. A shelf in the
entryway holds budget-themed vintage board games and books such as
"Budget: A Consumer Math Game" and "How to Buy the Best for Less:
Champagne Living on a Beer Budget." Everything there was found on
EBay.</TE>
<TE>   Budget Living hopes to help you find cheap chic by doing all the
detective work. It's a lifestyle magazine that promises stylish
products at savvy prices. Each bimonthly issue covers fashion,
travel, entertaining, interior design and personal finance.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not about cheaping out on everything you own," Miller
said. "It's about knowing when to splurge and when to save. It's not
a bargain if it looks poor."</TE>
<TE>   It couldn't come at a better time. Set to hit newsstands on Oct.
8, Budget Living is getting attention because of its serendipitous
launch during an economic downturn. Gray and Budget Living's
publisher, Donald E. Welsh, (he started Arthur Frommer's Budget
Travel) are counting on tighter wallets to bolster circulation.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy was a coincidence," Miller said. "Don was moving
forward with this before the economy slowed down. This trend toward
great design with great prices was happening before."</TE>
<TE>   Think Ikea, Old Navy, Southwest, Target and HGTV's "Trading
Spaces."</TE>
<TE>   "They'll make the cover price [$3.95] back in five minutes,"
Miller said. "Everyone loves a bargain. But it's a lot of work to go
out and find them. We've picked through all the merchandise and done
all the legwork."</TE>
<TE>   The concept was developed before Sept. 11, and in the initial
months after the terrorist attacks, it was difficult to persuade
anyone to buy magazine ads.</TE>
<TE>   "But as the economy got worse, the concept for the magazine got
better," said Eric Rayman, Budget Living president.</TE>
<TE>   Rayman estimates there will be more than 50 pages of ads in the
140-page first issue. Rayman said Welsh raised between $5 million and
$10 million to start the magazine with an initial circulation of
300,000.</TE>
<TE>   In a quest to find the most fashionable jeans at the least
expensive price, the staff bought $17 Route 66 jeans at Kmart and
wore them to a New York City bar. Once there, they polled patrons
about how much they thought the jeans cost. The average response:
$100. That thrilled Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Among the regular features are D.I.Y. (do it yourself), explaining
doable home projects. The Goods, a shopping section, showcases
several examples of one item at one price point. A collecting page
highlights the next about-to-be-collectible, still at reasonable
prices. The Check Out section sends a professional shopping with $100
and explains what to splurge on and what you can skimp on. For
example, a hairdresser answers the question: Are you supposed to use
cheap shampoo and an expensive hairbrush?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a total budget shopper," Miller said. "I can never help but
tell everyone what everything costs. My mother's always like, 'You
don't have to tell everyone that you only paid $30 for that dress.'
But I can't help it."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Crisp white linen. Fresh flowers. Sparkling crystal. Candlelight and
soft music. The man at table 7 asks to speak to the chef.</LD>
<LD>   His foie gras is underdone, he informs her. Describing the precise
length of time and temperature at which it was cooked, the chef tells
him it's perfectly poached. He insists it is not. She explodes. "It's
like casting pearls before swine.... And why don't you throw out the
wine too?--because with all that smoking, you'll never taste it!"</LD>
<LD>   Meet Chef Klein, the main character in the new movie "Mostly
Martha," a gifted cook who lives for her work. The dining room diva's
antics provide a revenge fantasy for anyone who's ever worked in a
restaurant. But there's realism, roasted to perfection, in Martha's
steely constitution, say female chefs who know it takes a tough
cookie to run a kitchen.</LD>
<TE>   "You need to be undauntable," says Mary Sue Milliken, the
chef-restaurateur who co-owns the Border Grill chain and Ciudad with
Susan Feniger. "You have to believe in it so thoroughly because
you'll get discouraged, every step of the way, every turn in the
road, unless you are determined."</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I needed to be as tough as the guys were," says
Feniger, who began her culinary training when professional kitchens
were strictly a man's world. "I didn't think about being a woman as
being something that got in the way."</TE>
<TE>   Neither did Nancy Silverton, chef-owner of Campanile and La Brea
Bakery. "I've always pulled my own weight, and I've always been
appreciated for what I do," she says.</TE>
<TE>   In "Mostly Martha," which opened Friday,  the image of a
formidable female chef is bang on, says Ann Cooper of Women Chefs &amp;
Restaurateurs, a 2,000-member organization that promotes the
education and advancement of women in the restaurant industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Internationally, the ratio of women to men chefs is very low,"
Cooper says. "But in the U.S., about 45% of all chefs and cooks are
women, and that includes places like Denny's and fast-food
restaurants." At the executive chef level--Martha's job--about 15% to
20% are women.</TE>
<TE>   The profession mixes culinary and business skills, mental and
physical stamina, and requires a high degree of perfectionism. Those
characteristics, and her mother's admiration for female chefs and
cookbook authors such as Viana La Place and Patricia Wells, attracted
German writer-director Sandra Nettelbeck to the subject.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to make it as a chef, you really have to love what
you do," she says. "They work six days a week and they never get to
go anywhere, because if you want to get your restaurant going, you
have to be there all the time."</TE>
<TE>   That single-mindedness has made Martha a popular character.
Nettelbeck's film, a sleeper hit in Germany, where it was titled
"Bella Martha," has been distributed in 40 countries. Martina Gedeck
won the German Film Award for best actress for her performance in the
title role.</TE>
<TE>   Nettelbeck wanted to write about a person who was wrapped up in
her profession. "She's an extremist because that's all she does and
she's oblivious to how it could be different," Nettelbeck says.
"Martha is a grown woman. She's found her place in life and then she
finds love, and she has to make room for it"--because her job at a
chic restaurant in Hamburg requires all her attention.</TE>
<TE>   True to life again, say Milliken and Feniger, especially in the
kitchen scenes, with line cooks sauteing frantically, waiters buzzing
in and out, the clatter of dishes and all the spills and accidents.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked very realistic, just how chaotic, discombobulated and
wacky it can be," says Milliken, who also appreciated "the
camaraderie of the staff."</TE>
<TE>   In the film, Martha is in complete command of the kitchen, but her
meticulously organized life up-ends like a tarte Tatin when her
sister dies, leaving her to care for an 8-year-old niece. With no
clue about parenting, she takes the child to work each night until
her boss, the restaurant's owner, tells her it's no place for kids.</TE>
<TE>   A lunch-rush visit to the kitchen of Ciudad bears this out.</TE>
<TE>   First, Feniger and Milliken make their way through a space that
seems less than 2 feet wide (not an exact measurement, but Paul
Prudhomme couldn't work here).</TE>
<TE>   Line cooks hustle along rubber mats to the grill. The flooring
feels like it's coated with a slippery mixture of moisture created by
steam and olive oil. If you feel "slidey," Milliken says, you're not
in the proper shoes. "You couldn't come to work in my kitchen," she
tells a reporter in sandals.</TE>
<TE>   She points out the dangers around every corner. Huge pots bubble
away. Pounds of onions are being sauteed in hot oil. Drips and spills
can cause horrible burns, says Milliken, launching into the tale of a
worker in another kitchen who fell down a set of stairs, landing her
leg in a pot of boiling chicken stock sitting on the floor at the
bottom. The staff immediately helped her immerse the limb in a tub of
ice cream, but she still ended up in the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The soup was probably on the floor because it was too heavy to
carry, say the chefs, an observation that launches them into war
stories about weightlifting. Milliken demonstrates one method of
moving a humongous stockpot: Set it on the floor, stick a kitchen
towel through one handle and drag it.</TE>
<TE>   Feniger just dead-lifts things. Standing 5 feet tall, she picks up
a 50-pound load of fish like it's a Nordstrom gift box. Then she
describes the shooting back pains she used to experience while doing
daily kitchen duty.</TE>
<TE>   She schleps the fish into the chilly walk-in fridge, then heads
back to the grill, where it's hotter than a west Texas July. It's not
bad, they say, unless you're standing there roasting chiles for five
hours.</TE>
<TE>   The two are in their element. Armed with plastic spoons, they
dance in and out of tight spaces in a quality-control tasting ballet.
They're dipping into a sage-colored cumin-cilantro sauce, glossy
black beans mixed with rice, and a caldron of butternut squash puree,
fragrant with herbs.</TE>
<TE>   Between bites, they're checking the presentation of an appetizer
platter of sweet red Spanish peppers stuffed with avocado and goat
cheese, and entree plates of grilled salmon filets with a brick-red
chile sauce and a Nuevo Latino side of snowy white mashed yuca.</TE>
<TE>   If it were just cooking, the job would be a lot easier, they say.
Their company, which includes restaurants in Los Angeles, Pasadena
and Las Vegas, employs 350 workers, and they have an open-door
policy, which means they take regular meetings with employees,
listening to problems big and small. That sets them apart from
Martha, who snaps at underlings and then retreats into the walk-in
fridge to escape confrontations.</TE>
<TE>   "Most chefs are divas," says Cooper. "But you need to come to
grips with your customers. If you only want to cook for yourself, you
need to stay home." Whether it's dealing with employees or customers,
she says, it helps to be a "people person."</TE>
<TE>   It also helps to be a savvy businesswoman. Just as Martha went to
market each day, carefully ordering produce, chefs watch that bottom
line, sometimes staying awake at night because there is little room
for error. And if they're celebrity chefs like Milliken, Feniger and
Silverton, they also have to juggle TV appearances, work on Web sites
and coordinate intense marketing.</TE>
<TE>   It's all part of the job--which is sometimes as tricky as spinning
sugar.</TE>
<TE>   But these chefs wouldn't trade their profession. Like Martha,
their greatest passions play out at the table and that's evident in
the film, Silverton says.</TE>
<TE>   "Passion and dedication, those two attributes really came through.
I love it when I can tell that a chef has coached the actors to look
and feel like real chefs."</TE>

<LD>Servals</LD>
<LD>   Almost everyone laughs when they first see a serval. Why is that?</LD>
<LD>   Probably because its body parts don't seem to go together. A
serval has a very small head that looks out of proportion to its body
size. Its ears are enormous. Its body is long. Its tail is short. And
everything is balanced on four very long, thin legs.</LD>
<TE>   Servals are medium-sized felines, averaging 2 feet tall at the
shoulder and weighing 25 pounds. They have light-tan fur and a
beautiful pattern of black spots and bars. The name "serval" comes
from the Portuguese language and means "wolf-deer."</TE>
<TE>   Some people think servals look like cheetahs, but their legs
aren't used for running, they're used for jumping. To knock down
birds, servals can jump over 10 feet, straight up in the air! Mostly
they jump on rodents (mice and rats) hiding in tall grasses. With
their large ears they can hear the rodent moving in the grass or even
underground in a burrow.</TE>
<TE>   Servals are found all across southern Africa (below the Sahara
desert area). They live along rivers where there are many tall
grasses and reeds. Some farmers like to have servals on their land
because they kill rodents that could damage their crops.</TE>
<TE>   You can see a serval and learn more about it and other wild
felines at the Exotic Feline Breeding Compound's Feline Conservation
Center in Rosamond, Calif. Hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Thursday
through Tuesday. For more information, visit www.cathouse-fcc.org, or

<HD>Happily Ever After</HD>
<DH>Once upon a time, successful authors didn't dare cross into
children's literature. Harry Potter has emboldened them --and their
publishers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Chabon's new book, "Summerland," is the reason the Pulitzer
Prize winner became a writer. When he was 10 and 11 and 12, the boy
that Chabon was dreamed of writing a book about adventure and magic,
myth and heroism. A book that incorporated all the things he liked to
read--"The Chronicles of Narnia," "Harriet the Spy" and Susan
Cooper's "The Dark Is Rising" series--but with American kids. For 25
years, Chabon imagined that book. What he couldn't imagine was any
publisher wanting it.</LD>
<LD>   Then came Harry Potter.</LD>
<LD>   "Before, if I had gone to my agent and said, 'I think I'll write a
kids' book,' the reaction probably would have been, 'Are you sure you
want to spend a year on a book I may not be able to sell?' " Chabon
says. "But now the reaction is, 'Hmmmm, what a great idea.' "</LD>
<TE>   Harry Potter, who conjured billions of dollars in book sales out
of an age group everyone assumed was functionally illiterate, has
facilitated another miracle--the American adult-kid crossover author.
Joyce Carol Oates has a young-adult book just out, and this fall,
Chabon's "Summerland" will join a pantheon of first-time
kid-literature efforts: "City of Beasts" (HarperCollins) by Isabel
Allende, "Coraline" (HarperCollins) by Neil Gaiman and "Hoot" (Knopf)
by Carl Hiaasen.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidence may have some part in the production of such a list,
says Diane Roback, children's book editor of Publishers Weekly. "I
wouldn't call it a huge trend," she says. "But the success of Harry
Potter has shown a lot of people that children's fiction has never
been more vibrant."</TE>
<TE>   The marketing of fiction in America, says Roback, is highly
segmented, and people who don't have children have no reason for
perusing the children's section of their local Barnes &amp; Noble. "It is
very difficult to market an all-ages book here," she says. "Or to
market a young-adult title to adults." In Europe, she says, things
are not so highly segregated--a novel is marketed, and read, as a
novel rather than a young-adult novel or a children's book.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a very different tradition of reading in Europe," she
says. "I was just in Italy, and 'Stargirl' [a young-adult title] was
on display right along with the adult fiction. And many adults were
buying it."</TE>
<TE>   This might explain why many British writers have moved fluidly
from adult to children's fiction and back again, but very few
Americans have. Mark Twain and E.B. White managed quite well, but few
modern writers have attempted it because, quite simply, the
publishing world did not encourage it.</TE>
<TE>   Hiaasen says he was shocked that Knopf, which publishes his
satiric mystery books, was willing, even eager, for him to write a
children's book. Especially since the idea had come from an editor at
competing HarperCollins. "I thought it would be interesting--a writer
should always try new things," he says. "My agent was for it but
thought we should check with Knopf because they have been so good to
me. I didn't think they'd be interested at all, but they were, and
suddenly there I was, committed."</TE>
<TE>   Big names have been making their way onto the shelves of the
children's section for a number of years now, but most of them would
be more likely to have been nominated for an Oscar or an Emmy than a
Pulitzer. Jamie Lee Curtis is working on her fourth children's book,
John Lithgow on his third; coming soon are first-time efforts from
Marlee Matlin and Spike Lee and the reissue of a story penned by a
13-year-old Elizabeth Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these books are good, says Roback, but they do not herald
the potential broadening of minds and markets as "Summerland" or
"City of Beasts" does. "These are books by talented writers,
wonderful writers. Kids won't care who the author is if it's a good
book, but adults will," she says. "And whatever gets a reader into a
different section of the bookstore is a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   The writers seem equally delighted with the opportunity. "It's a
natural idea for a writer," says Chabon, "if you have children or
even if you just have fond memories of certain books from your
childhood."</TE>
<TE>   "Summerland" is almost exactly the book he dreamed of writing when
he was a child. In it, an 11-year-old boy goes on an epic quest into
a magical land where good can triumph only by superior skill in
baseball. The characters had been hanging around in his imagination
for almost 25 years, Chabon says, and when his eldest child, Sophie,
began reading chapter books, he decided to finally let them out.</TE>
<TE>   Neil Gaiman ("American Gods" and "Stardust") also began writing
"Coraline" for his daughter Holly, who was 5 at the time. But the
book took a bit longer to write than he thought, and when he finished
10 years later, it was aimed more for his daughter Maddy, now 7. The
result is an eerie tale about a girl who finds a door to a world that
is almost like this one but not quite.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to write a book they would enjoy when they were older,"
he says, via e-mail. "A book that no one else had written."</TE>
<TE>   Isabel Allende, whose works include "The House of the Spirits" and
the more recent "Daughter of Fortune" and "Portrait in Sepia," had
written several storybooks at the beginning of her career that were
published in Chile. With all three of her grandchildren now of
chapter book age, she decided to write something for them.</TE>
<TE>   "I have great respect for kids," says Allende. "Some [writers]
tend to talk down to them, but they are much smarter than most adults
because they are open-minded."</TE>
<TE>   After years of writing historical novels, Allende returned to her
magical-realism roots with "City of Beasts," a tale of a boy who goes
on a mystical adventure in the Amazon with his travel-writer
grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven years of telling her grandchildren stories made it easy for
Allende to write for the 10-and-older set, and the experience was so
exhilarating that she plans for the book to become a trilogy.</TE>
<TE>   "It was wonderful, so free," she says, "like going back to 'House
of Spirits.' I wrote it happily, playfully and fast. Magic realism is
perfect for modern kids because they like magic but they want it
explained."</TE>
<TE>   Hiaasen had a little trouble at first. He wanted to write a story
that would deal with themes and issues similar to his adult work,
that would include the satire he has become known for. "But I didn't
know if I could take myself back and paint with new eyes, to see what
I saw as a child rather than an adult."</TE>
<TE>   He talked a lot with some of his friends from childhood, men and
women who still live in Florida, and that helped a lot. "I remembered
what it felt like to grow up in Florida, to watch while our little
patch of paradise was paved over before our eyes."</TE>
<TE>   After that the book came fast, in about seven months, which, he
says, is a record for him. In "Hoot," a series of pranks continuously
slows down the construction of a pancake house on a lot that is home
to a tribe of burrowing owls, and the discovery of who is behind the
destruction teaches the main character a lot about life and himself.
Hiaasen says he and his friends pulled a lot of stunts similar to
those in the book and that the anger they felt when the lots they
played in, and hunted snakes on, were turned into strip malls was
exactly that of the heroes and heroine of the book.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids at that age are great," he says. "They haven't been messed
up by getting an MBA and having folks tell them it's all right to
work for Philip Morris peddling products that kill people. They seem
to have a tremendous clarity about what is right and what is wrong."</TE>
<TE>   All of the authors say that for once it wasn't the opinions of
their agents or editors or even reviewers they feared, but those of
the kids. Chabon read portions of the book in progress to his
daughter and was amazed at her ability to retain detail.</TE>
<TE>   "She saw a lot of little things, continuity-wise, and I made one
really egregious mistake that she caught," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Gaiman wasn't worried about making the book too scary or
disturbing because, he says, children have a much higher capacity to
cope with horror, death and monsters than adults do. And when he gave
the book to a bunch of kids and adults to read, he was proved right.
"The kids read it as an adventure; the adults, however, complained of
bad dreams and having to go around the house turning on all the
lights."</TE>
<TE>   Allende could not send an early draft to her grandchildren--she
writes in Spanish and they read only English--but she sent copies of
the manuscripts to five schools in Spain and asked for feedback.
Because of what the children said, she made a lot of changes, she
says, including a new ending.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted more about the animals," she said. "They are very
into the ecology. And they didn't want so many things left open. But
this is supposed to be the first of three, so I had to leave some
things open, but I tried to tie others together."</TE>
<TE>   After Hiaasen gave his final draft to his 14-year-old stepson, he
retreated to his office to bite his nails for several days. While he
was happy to finally have written a book without an R rating for
language and content, he knew that a negative response would be "the
most crushing review I would ever get." Instead, he got a
thumbs-up--"the ultimate compliment from a skateboarder."</TE>
<TE>   If he was pleasantly surprised to find how much fun it was to
write for kids, Hiaasen was amazed by the almost antithetical
attitudes of the adult and youth publishing worlds. "With my regular
books, you're watching the [bestseller] lists right away because you
have like a four-week window to know if your book is going to tank or
not," he says. "But [the publishers of children's fiction] are
talking about building sales year by year, about keeping a book in
print, about whether it's going to cross generations. For an author's
ego, this is very soothing."</TE>
<TE>   Chabon and Allende have already committed to at least two more
children's books. Gaiman would like to do another, and hopes it will
take him less than 10 years this time. Hiaasen, however, is waiting
to see what the kids think. "I'm really going to have to connect with
kids, go into classrooms, I guess," he says. "Because the reviews are
important but not like what the kids think."</TE>
<TE>   If they like "Hoot," he says, he'll definitely give the genre
another go. "If they don't," he says with a verbal shrug, "I'll just
continue doing this other sick stuff that I do."</TE>

<HD>A Widow's Story</HD>
<DH>After her husband died on a Sept. 11 flight, Lisa Beamer
took on a public role. Now she hopes her book brings closure and a
return to private life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINA PICCALO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lisa Beamer sits patiently under the camera crew's bright lights in a
West Los Angeles bookstore while a photographer scampers around her.
She is running late and her publicists hover just off camera, urging
reporters to free their client.</LD>
<LD>   Larry King is waiting across town at CNN studios to talk with her
about her new memoir. "We need to go!" says Tina Jacobson. The
publicist sighs loudly when no one appears to budge. She tries again.
"We're walking to the car!" she says, prompting everyone to give
Beamer some room.</LD>
<LD>   To her credit, Beamer remains the most poised of the group. She
greets a visitor with genuine warmth, seemingly oblivious to her
publicists' anxiety. The bookstore manager is so moved by her
composure that she whispers to an acquaintance, "Whenever I talk
about [Sept. 11] I start to cry. But she's just fine." Within
moments, Beamer and her harried entourage are off.</LD>
<TE>   In the last 11 months, the 33-year-old mother of three has become
one of the nation's most in-demand media celebrities. She can't leave
her home in bucolic Cranbury, N.J., without being stopped by a
stranger who knows intimate details of her life.</TE>
<TE>   She is bombarded by thousands of speaking invitations and letters
from well-wishers every week. She's booked months in advance.</TE>
<TE>   This is the most public way her life has changed since her
husband, Todd Beamer, a 32-year-old software accounts manager, died
aboard the hijacked United Airlines Flight 93 on Sept. 11. He and
other passengers are believed to have rushed the team of terrorists
aboard their flight, sending their plane crashing into the
Pennsylvania countryside and saving an intended target in Washington,
D.C.</TE>
<TE>   His last known words-- "Let's roll"--became the battle cry for the
nation and elevated his then-pregnant widow to near icon status.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate the thought of people recognizing me because I'm attached
to this tragedy," said Beamer, during a phone interview last week.
"But I think it's important for people to connect with the people ...
intimately connected to the tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   The media wholly embraced Beamer in the days after the crash as a
gentle presence in the storm of bad news, calling her "calm and
radiant." And she seemed comfortable in the spotlight. Early on, she
grieved publicly during interviews on ABC-TV's "Good Morning
America," "Dateline NBC," "20/20," "60 Minutes" and "Oprah." She was
heralded a hero after a joint session of Congress on Sept. 20 gave
her a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   In October, she boarded the United Airlines Newark-San Francisco
flight that her husband had taken, telling "Good Morning America:" "I
refuse to be held captive, and I will not be fearful."</TE>
<TE>   The birth of her daughter, Morgan, in January was international
news. During a February prayer breakfast at the White House, Beamer
joked about her attempts to trademark her husband's words. When the
president introduced her with "Let's roll," she quipped: "Mr.
President, those two words are copyrighted. That'll be $1,000."
(Actually, the trademark is pending.) Even People magazine named her
one of the "25 Most Intriguing People of 2001."</TE>
<TE>   This week, Beamer resumes her position in front of the
cameras--specifically on CBS, NBC's "Today," "Good Morning America"
and of course, "Larry King Live." Her memoir, titled (naturally)
"Let's Roll!" details the couple's roots, their early years together,
their marriage and their strong commitment to evangelical
Christianity. (The book was published first with the subtitle,
"Finding Hope in the Midst of Crisis," but is now subtitled "Ordinary
People, Extraordinary Courage" [Tyndale House Publishers]).</TE>
<TE>   The book offers a painfully intimate look at the tragedy from
Beamer's perspective. She writes that she learned of the crash from a
television news report, and collapsed when the newscaster confirmed
that the flight originated in Newark and was bound for San Francisco.
She intuitively knew Todd had taken that flight. She remained in a
"near-catatonic" state for hours while friends and family managed the
household.</TE>
<TE>   In the months after, she struggled to deal with the loss,
sometimes sitting on the floor of her husband's closet and weeping
alone.</TE>
<TE>   The idea for the book wasn't hers. Earlier this year, friends
encouraged her to write it, she said. "Initially, I kind of laughed,
thinking that it would be a five-page book," said Beamer. Later,
however, she teamed with writer Ken Abraham, who wrote "Payne
Stewart: The Authorized Biography" (Broadman Press, 2000) with the
golfer's widow Tracey Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Beamer's book was written from interviews that Abraham conducted
with the couple's friends and family, with some passages written by
Beamer. It was completed in three months.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought there could be some value in painting a bigger picture
of [Todd] than what was known of him in one half-hour" at the end of
his life, said Beamer.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, the public persona seems to have worn thin. "It's
sort of another thing I have to deal with at this point," she said.
"I guess, for me, I'm sort of done reshaping Sept. 11, in a lot of
ways."</TE>
<TE>   Beamer is ready for life to return to some semblance of normal. On
the anniversary of her husband's death, she plans to be at home for a
quiet and very personal memorial with her children, David, 4, Drew,
2, and Morgan, 8 months, and a friend whose husband's died in the
World Trade Center. "I have a limited bandwidth to all the things I
can handle," she said. "My primary concern is just to take care of my
piece of the world."</TE>

<DH>The gnawing feeling hit late that mosquitoes mean business</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOAN SPRINGHETTI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I have a mosquito bite. Actually, I have about 15 of them, but the
most recent one, the one I am focused on this minute, is the one I
picked up last week in Illinois.</LD>
<LD>   The mosquito is powerful in many places today. Powerful enough to
make governments, parents and the bitten jump. Powerful enough to
keep folks in a dozen states, including Illinois, on their toes this
summer as human cases of West Nile virus, a sometimes fatal disease,
have been reported.</LD>
<LD>   The parents of a 6-year-old I visited in a small town outside
Chicago take the matter very seriously: Their daughter can play
outside, but not until she is sprayed down with insect repellent, and
not after sundown, as that is when not only the boogeyman but also
virus-carrying mosquitoes have a reputation for coming out.</LD>
<TE>   I feel like I am coming to my appreciation of mosquito dangers
rather late in life.</TE>
<TE>   As a kid, I got chewed up plenty--and it was an annoyance--but we
were never worried about the bite of a 'skeeter. Bites from
rattlesnakes, or black widow spiders, those we were afraid of and
took action to avoid (I learned from my dad that one should always
shake out one's boots before putting them on, just in case, as had
happened once to someone who knew someone he knew, a rattler had
crawled inside for a nap. And my mom taught me, that, when unfolding
a stored blanket, I should shake it out in case a black widow had
settled there).</TE>
<TE>   When my own daughter was little, I'm afraid I did nothing concrete
to protect her from mosquitoes, rattlers or black widows. A luxury, I
like to think, of growing up in urban Southern California rather than
malfeasance on my part. (For the record, I did slather sun block on
her from time to time.)</TE>
<TE>   The mosquito bite I picked up in Illinois appeared despite the
fact that I have the following recently purchased repellent products
at my fingertips: REI Jungle Juice 100, active ingredient
N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide ( or DEET, in common parlance); Sawyer
clothing spray, active ingredient permethrin; Avon's Skin-So-Soft,
active ingredient IR3535 ethyl butylacetylamino-propionate. None of
them worked, but of course, that may be because I did not apply any
of them to my person.</TE>
<TE>   I don't own all those products because I was going into West Nile
virus territory. They are leftovers from an earlier trip this summer
to the Tropics, a trip on which I figured I had better prepare, as
never before, to battle mosquitoes. I knew the stories of how malaria
had felled thousands in the cause of building the Panama Canal, and
how most Central American countries had been experiencing outbreaks
of dengue fever, and figured the mosquitoes of Costa Rica were
probably something to be reckoned with.</TE>
<TE>   Lots of anti-mosquito advice came my way. Don't eat sweets,
mosquitoes sense it in your pores and are attracted, advised one
person over lunch and dessert. Take B-complex vitamins, a Web site
urged, and mosquitoes will turn their noses up at you.</TE>
<TE>   "DEET, DEET, DEET," said a friend, in retrospect, after returning
with some whopper bites from a lakeside visit in Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   One piece of advice I did prepare to follow: Wear long-sleeved
shirts and long pants. Like much good advice, following it required
some discomfort given that the heat and humidity were always about 85
to 90.</TE>
<TE>   You can probably understand my surprise when--armed with the
various mosquito-fighting chemical potions that my traveling
companion (my sister-in-law from New York) and I had brought with us
on this trip--I heard our first guide in Costa Rica telling us not to
worry about mosquitoes.</TE>
<TE>   "Here we are," he said, as our little boat wound its way through
canals in a remote rain forest, "in the middle of nowhere, and there
are no mosquitoes, right?" He was right of course.</TE>
<TE>   Which isn't the same as saying there are no mosquitoes in the
middle-of-nowhere's jungles.</TE>
<TE>   His eco-friendly advice: Carry insect repellent with you, but only
apply it when you actually encounter mosquitoes.</TE>
<TE>   I believed he had no reason not to be honest in this matter, so as
we crisscrossed the country, encountering crocodiles, bullet ants and
potholes big enough to swallow Jeeps full of tourists, I wore long
sleeves and long pants and applied mosquito repellent sparingly.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, my devil-may-care strategy was not completely
successful (I was perhaps too sparing a time or two with the
repellent, never touched a B-complex vitamin, did eat sweets most
days) and ended up picking up a nice array of bites around both
ankles (which accounts for the high bite count noted earlier).</TE>
<TE>   The first newspaper I picked up when I got back in the States
contained the headline "West Nile Virus Death Is 1st Confirmed in
U.S. in 2002." Out of the jungle and into the frying pan.</TE>
<TE>   Near as I can tell, I do not have malaria or dengue fever from my
Costa Rican bites, nor West Nile Virus from my Illinois bite. As I
scratch away at their remnants, I will try to maintain a casual
demeanor, even on days when I think I notice that my throat feels a
tad scratchy ... or my head aches just a bit. I want mosquitoes out
of the headlines so I can worry about bigger things--like
rattlesnakes and black widow spiders.</TE>

<LD>Mr. Lee was lonely. When his wife died two years ago, he thought he
could manage alone. Now he was sad most of the time. He wrote to his
only child, a daughter, who had asked him to come to the United
States and live with her. Mr. Lee said he was ready to leave Korea
and make America his new home.</LD>
<LD>   Mr. Lee barely knew his son-in-law and had seen his granddaughter
Nellie only once. Nellie's parents had brought her to Seoul to meet
her grandparents and celebrate her first birthday. It is traditional
in Korea to give a birthday party when a child turns one year. The
baby is dressed in a silk robe and is seated behind a low table.
Various gifts are arranged on the table: coins, a pencil, a dish of
food, a toy. It is believed that whatever the baby picks up first,
points to her destiny. A future writer might choose the pencil;
picking the coins might mean wealth. Little Nellie had used both
hands to pick up the food and the toy. Mr. Lee hoped this meant his
granddaughter would be a chef and that she would make time for
playing, too.</LD>
<TE>   The grandfather dreamed about how nice it would be to teach his
granddaughter how to cook some of his favorite Korean dishes like
kimchi (kim-chee), spicy pickled cabbage; and kkwabaeji
(kwah-beh-jee), thin crisp cookies; and, of course, duk (dhok), rice
cakes stuffed with crushed beans and seasoned with sugar and sesame
seeds. To a Korean, life is not complete without rice cakes.</TE>
<TE>   And oh! How he hoped Nellie would like to play games! He could
teach her yut (yoot) if he brought the necessary four sticks with
him. And maybe she could learn chongi chop-ki (chohng-ee jup-kee),
paper folding, much like Japanese origami. Wouldn't it be wonderful,
Mr. Lee thought, to be friends with his granddaughter and never be
lonely again?</TE>

<HD>Simon Sees Layoffs as Volunteer Opportunity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The pink-slipping Bill Simon Jr. campaign recently let go nearly half
of its steroidally overstaffed campaign. But in an interview with
CNN's Judy Woodruff, who put it to Simon that such a thing "doesn't
sound like a campaign in strong shape," Simon said this:</LD>
<LD>   "Well, no, that's actually not what happened, Judy. You know, we
offered something short of half of our people the opportunity to stay
on the campaign in a volunteer capacity."</LD>
<LD>   Let that sink in for a moment: They weren't laid off, they were
given the opportunity to volunteer. To continue: " ... almost 80% of
them have chosen to do that," Simon said. "So actually most of the
people have stayed with the campaign ... and that actually is an
indication of the level of support that we have received from our
people."</LD>
<TE>   Eighty percent? The Simon campaign has yet to provide the precise
number of the 30-some workers who chose to hang around and work for
free.</TE>
<TE>   A better tenor of sentiment is in a cleverly fake newswire story
making the Internet rounds, generated, according to some, by a Simon
"volunteer." That story reads:</TE>
<TE>   Democratic Governor Gray Davis today launched four new
hard-hitting television spots attacking Republican gubernatorial
candidate Bill Simon on various fronts. The first-time candidate
quickly responded to this new onslaught by firing half his staff.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis has been a failure as governor of California," Simon
said. "And I am fully prepared to fire all of my staff if that's what
it takes to get the message across."</TE>
<TE>   Simon Campaign Manager Rob Lapsley said (the) space-clearing move
was designed to streamline the campaign for the fall push.</TE>
<TE>   "With the fall push coming on, and the campaign expecting to be
overrun with media and volunteer requests, we thought it would be
best if [we] eliminated staff to make it much easier to handle,"
Lapsley said, pausing only to fire another staffer via cell phone.
"Also, by firing some junior staffers, we were able to scrape
together enough cash to buy a TV ad that will be aired three times on
a late-night cable channel rerun of 'Saved by the Bell.' We expect
this move to inspire a lot of confidence in large and small donors
who feel this campaign is on the right track."</TE>
<TE>   The Gray Davis committee did not return calls because they were
busy plotting the governor's 2004 White House campaign.</TE>
<TE>   MAPA Makes Up Its Mind, Backs Simon</TE>
<TE>   The roiling ranks of MAPA, the Mexican American Political Assn.,
have been bubbling again.</TE>
<TE>   Last time, it was before the March primary, when the president of
the group endorsed Bill Jones as MAPA's Republican guy for governor,
but the executive committee snatched that away and backed Richard
Riordan. The committee said the president was not the president but
rather head of a local chapter.</TE>
<TE>   The odd man out then was GOP nominee Bill Simon Jr., who's been
airing Spanish-language ads, and whose campaign went to some trouble
recently to make sure it had a lot of supporters at MAPA's
convention, in hopes of winning an endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   But the annual convention at the Biltmore in downtown L.A. was
canceled before it really got revved up; so many scuffles broke out
over the ground rules that hotel security had to step in repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   Simon nonetheless showed up in Pershing Square opposite the hotel,
wearing a brightly embroidered blue Mexican guayabera shirt over his
navy blue polo shirt, and blamed Gray Davis for engineering the
cancellation.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's campaign had already set up gear for shooting a TV
commercial, and his supporters burst into on-cue cheers for the
cameras. About two dozen MAPA members huddled and announced that 22
of the group's chapters had just endorsed Simon for governor. The
Simon campaign immediately sent forth a press release: "Major Latino
Organization Overwhelmingly Endorses Simon." At least until you hear
otherwise....</TE>
<TE>   GOP Coalition Comes Out for Mary Cheney</TE>
<TE>   Mary Cheney, the vice president's openly lesbian daughter, will be
honored Sept. 5 at an L.A. fund-raiser for the Republican Unity
Coalition, which longs to make the party more inclusive. The group
was co-founded by Brian O'Leary Bennett, who was for quite a while
the chief of staff to anti-homosexual Congressman Robert K. Dornan,
who once noted proudly that "every lesbian spear-chucker in this
country is hoping I get defeated."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he was, and Bennett came out of the closet.</TE>
<TE>   The Cheney event, at a private home, will include "special guests"
Bill and Cindy Simon. These honors are rather different from the last
California award given to Mary Cheney, this one by gay activists who
named her as a winner of a "Gay Shame Award," presented to those they
believe are hypocrites. In Congress, Cheney's father was one of 13 to
vote in 1988 against funding for AIDS testing and research, and was
one of 29 the same year to vote against a Hate Crimes Statistics Act.</TE>
<TE>   Next month's event is to hit the coalition's $1-million
fund-raising goal for "Big Tent" Republicans running for the House
and Senate in November.</TE>
<TE>   Muholland Is Jester in Bush Fund-Raiser</TE>
<TE>   The left coast's Democratic party prankster is pranking about
again.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Mulholland delivered misfortune-filled fortune cookies to news
outlets inside the Beltway to mark President Bush's fund-raising
appearances in California on behalf of Simon, whose own funds were
hit with bad fortune after a jury found his firm guilty of fraud and
assessed $78 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland stuffed the cookies with recent Bush remarks he said
should resonate with Simon: "Executives who commit fraud ... when
they are guilty of criminal wrongdoing, they will face jail time;"
"Corporate leaders who violate the public trust should never be given
that trust again;" and "No more easy money for corporate criminals,
just hard time."</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland has also been sharing copies of a thank-you note he
received from Rebecca Davis, the fiancee of White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer, whose wedding is planned for a few days after the November
elections.</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland checked the bridal registry and sent the couple a pair
of Ralph Lauren Polo facecloths ($4.99 each). The polite, handwritten
note thanked Mulholland and said the couple "appreciate your well
wishes during this very special time." (It should be "good wishes,"
but not even the bride's fiance's boss, the president, sets much
store by such grammatical trifles.)</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland said it was "dumb" for them to thank him for a
"$10-dollar item," but he did acknowledge it's possible they just
don't know Mulholland the way Californians know him, and took the
gift at face value from a, um, "good-wisher."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone else looking to shop for the Fleischer/Davis menage will
find that their choice of china is a Lenox pattern called
"McKinley"--same name as the Republican president assassinated in
1901 and succeeded by young Teddy Roosevelt.</TE>
<TE>   Who's for Whom?</TE>
<TE>   Gray Davis: Erin Brockovich and her former boss, attorney Ed
Masry; the gay and lesbian group California Political Action
Committee; the district attorneys of the counties of Alameda,
Sacramento, Mendocino, Stanislaus, Colusa, Santa Clara, San Joaquin,
Sonoma, Imperial, Napa and Siskiyou.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Simon Jr.: the California Disabled Police Officers Assn. and
the Los Angeles Professional Sheriffs Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Scores of politicians and party organizations nationwide are
taking the pledge not to air political ads on and even around Sept.
11. Davis' campaign says it will pull ads on Sept. 10 and 11. Simon's
campaign said it will definitely hold its ads on Sept. 11 and would
consider the days flanking it. (Simon's campaign, compared with
Davis' deluxe bucks, would welcome a reason not to spend money it
doesn't have.)</TE>
<TE>   * The family of a Kern County supervisor who died in June filed a
workers' comp claim, saying the job's "stress and strain" killed
53-year-old Ken Peterson, a claim that could be worth up to $160,000.</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "It's a travesty of injustice."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Bernell Butler of Rubidoux, protesting a state appeals
court decision upholding a spousal assault conviction for the
minister, who led protests after the shooting death of his cousin
Tyisha Miller by Riverside police in December 1998. Butler's wife
told police her husband had beaten and threatened to kill her, but
later said she made up the charge. Butler says he was targeted for
prosecution because of the protests he led.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Separated at birth, again: The latest lost sibling/clone of Bill
Simon Jr.--evangelist Franklin Graham, right. Last week's
side-by-side of Simon and Orange County broadcaster Ed Arnold
prompted Tony Peyser, cartoonist for the Santa Monica Mirror, to say
that since "Inside Politics" ran that pairing, "Ed Arnold has taken a
10-point lead over the Democratic incumbent." (No one seems to
resemble Gray Davis.)</TE>

<HD>Paths Diverge for Fastow, Skilling</HD>
<DH>Energy: Two key Enron players have reacted differently
since the scandal unfolded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Andrew S. Fastow, the former Enron Corp. chief financial officer,
spends time these days driving his 6-year-old son to school, stopping
at Starbucks to pick up coffee and ducking out of carryout
restaurants.</LD>
<LD>   Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former chief executive and the ousted
Fastow's former boss, can be found eating at Houston's trendiest
restaurants, drinking gin at swank bars and attending lavish private
parties.</LD>
<LD>   As federal prosecutors aggressively pursue their criminal
investigation into Enron's collapse, Fastow and Skilling, the two men
at the heart of the Houston-based company's dramatic fall, have been
leading lives that are starkly different.</LD>
<TE>   While Fastow has tried to fade from public light, sequestering
himself with family and close friends, Skilling can be seen at hip
restaurants and bars, much as he was during his highflying days at
Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the 8-month-old Enron investigation has entered an important
new phase. Fastow last week was implicated by a key lieutenant as the
mastermind of three off-the-books partnerships, which eventually led
to the firm's filing for bankruptcy protection last year.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow's former subordinate Michael J. Kopper, who was a managing
director of Enron's global finance unit, pleaded guilty to federal
money-laundering and fraud charges and has agreed to cooperate with
prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts said Fastow could be headed for a long stretch in
jail unless he can provide significant evidence against his ex-boss
Skilling and former Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay. Both Skilling and
Lay have said they were not aware of the extent to which Fastow and
others profited personally from the off-the-books partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   One of the big questions in the Enron investigation centers on how
much Skilling, as the chief executive, knew about what his chief
financial officer, Fastow, was doing. And though close professionally
at Enron, the two men no longer appear to be in contact and have
charted different courses since the scandal unfolded. Skilling, for
example, testified before Congress while Fastow invoked his right not
to testify.</TE>
<TE>   There is good reason for their different approaches, former
employees and associates said. Fastow was never active in the Houston
social scene in the first place, but the increasing scrutiny of
federal investigators has prompted him to "circle the wagons" around
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow's close friends, who have rallied around him in the past,
have stopped talking to reporters since Kopper's plea last week.
Although Fastow has not been charged with any crimes, his role was
outlined in Kopper's plea agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege Fastow, Kopper and others pocketed millions of
dollars through three partnerships that did business with the energy
giant, including a previously undisclosed deal that cloaked Enron's
ownership of lucrative wind farms in California. On Friday, a judge
ordered some $23 million in assets owned by Fastow and others frozen
amid reports that Fastow's brother was attempting to transfer some of
his gains.</TE>
<TE>   "There was an arrangement between myself and the Enron CFO
[Fastow] whereby I did take some of the proceeds which I received
from managing and running that partnership and passed them on to he
and his family," Kopper said.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow's spokesman, Gordon Andrew, who has in the past described
his client as trying to lead a normal life, refused to share any
details of Fastow's activities. Fastow, who declined to testify
before Congress last winter, has not spoken publicly since he left
Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, former Enron employees have met or spotted Skilling at
various restaurants and bars, including Anthony's, Volcano's and
Zimm's Martini &amp; Wine, many of them in upscale neighborhoods with
streets resembling Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Former employees, some of whom worked directly with Skilling and
Fastow, said it was hard for them to believe that Skilling was not
aware of the transactions since Fastow often consulted with Skilling,
who was well-known for remembering the most minute financial details.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling had an "amazing ability" to remember the most arcane
details and quickly grasp even the most complicated transaction at
first hearing about them, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was brilliant in that way," said a former Enron executive, who
like most former employees spoke on condition of anonymity. "It's
hard to believe Skilling didn't know what was going on."</TE>
<TE>   Another executive said Skilling was careful of what he signed.
Documents approving particular transactions often would have
signatures of a number of his subordinates but not that of Skilling.</TE>
<TE>   "I would get these documents with seven or eight signatures on
them and the last line that was supposed to have Skilling's signature
would be blank," the executive.</TE>
<TE>   At a party last month, Skilling told a former employee that he
expected the case to drag on for three years, after which he would be
exonerated but left with little money.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling resigned from Enron last summer, before the company
disclosed huge losses that caused its stock to collapse. After
leaving the company, Skilling started a company called Veld Interest,
a "business looking for business," according to a news report.
Skilling hired his former Enron secretary and his wife to work at his
new venture.</TE>
<TE>   During the day, Skilling often is seen at his son's soccer
practice at a private Episcopal high school where he sits at the top
of the bleachers wearing a baseball cap.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling's former boss, Lay, has slowly begun returning to the
social circuit after staying away for months after Enron's collapse.
Lay, who immersed himself in local philanthropic and civic affairs
including the drive to build the city's baseball stadium, can be
spotted these days at his wife Linda's antique store, Jus' Stuff,
where bread plates sell for $50 and gilded chairs for $5,000. He
resigned from the company in January.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow, who lives in a 4,000-square-foot house in a manicured
neighborhood near Rice University where homes sell for $700,000 or
more, has given up on building his dream home near his former boss in
the exclusive River Oaks neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The 11,493-square-foot home has been listed as one of the
properties that prosecutors want to seize in connection with the
questionable partnerships. Still under construction, the home, with
limestone exterior and slate roof, was put up for sale last month.</TE>
<TE>   A former Enron executive said he spotted Fastow at a carryout
restaurant last month; he had disappeared into the bathroom only to
reappear five minutes later when his order was ready.</TE>
<TE>   Friends said Fastow has been finding solace in his Jewish faith,
regularly attending a synagogue in suburban Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been struggling. That's no rocket science," said Rabbi
Shaul Osadchey, who presides over a small congregation that meets in
an obscure office park nestled between apartments and warehouses.
"What he needs right now is a rabbi, not a spokesperson."</TE>

<HD>Gas Prices Rise Half a Cent in 2 Weeks</HD>
<DH>Energy: Motorists have seen little change in costs at the
pump since early April, a survey says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gas prices rose only half a penny a gallon in the last two weeks,
continuing an unusual 20-week trend of mostly steady prices.</LD>
<LD>   The average price for gas nationwide, including all grades and
taxes, was about $1.46 a gallon Friday, according to the Lundberg
survey of 8,000 stations released Sunday. That was up 0.5 cent per
gallon from Aug. 9.</LD>
<LD>   Prices have shown little change since early April, when a gallon
of gas also cost about $1.46, said analyst Trilby Lundberg.</LD>
<TE>   "In any recent memory it is extraordinary for prices to be so
little changed for 20 weeks, particularly at a time of such great
demand from early spring to late summer," she said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, for example, prices started around $1.54 in early April
before climbing to $1.76 in mid-May and falling to $1.51 by late
August. In 2000 it was the same pattern: A gallon of gas cost $1.57
in early April, jumped to $1.71 in late June and fell to $1.55 by
late August.</TE>
<TE>   This year there was no such midsummer spike. Lundberg said that
was the result of stability in crude oil prices and at U.S.
refineries.</TE>
<TE>   Gas today remains about a nickel cheaper than a year ago. On Aug.
24, 2001, the average weighted price for a gallon of gas was about
$1.51, Lundberg said.</TE>
<TE>   The national weighted average price of gasoline, including taxes,
at self-serve pumps Friday was about $1.42 per gallon for regular,
$1.52 for mid-grade and $1.61 for premium.</TE>

<HD>Heightened Scrutiny in Silicon Valley</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Some firms are changing practices that once
were standard in the tech industry as federal probes into inflated
figures heat up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Known for decades as a hotbed of technological innovation, Silicon
Valley in recent years has been nearly as inventive when it comes to
keeping the books.</LD>
<LD>   During the dot-com boom, pro forma earnings, entangling company
alliances, revenue by barter, and stock options by the boatload were
all part of the valley's standard operating procedure before they
spread to the likes of WorldCom Inc., Enron Corp. and Global Crossing
Ltd.</LD>
<LD>   Now, some of yesterday's high-tech heroes are nervously awaiting a
knock on the door from the Securities and Exchange Commission or the
FBI, and they are cleaning up their practices even as they struggle
to preserve the accounting for stock options that helped make them
look good.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to see more problems pop up," said Lynn Turner, a
former chief accountant at the SEC, who expects more tech companies
to face the consequences of their past creativity. "I don't know that
they all will escape."</TE>
<TE>   The fall of one major valley firm, or a series of mid-size
companies, could keep nervous investors from returning to a sector
that's already singed them in the market slide. That could seriously
injure the technology economy as it struggles to emerge from
recession and could even slow the pace of innovation, industry
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Few executives at the better-known firms have been accused of
major scams. But the pitter-patter of other shoes dropping is getting
louder.</TE>
<TE>   In the highest-profile case, the former president of e-mail
provider Critical Path Inc. pleaded guilty this year to securities
fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The former CEOs of two small public companies, Unify Corp. and
Quintus Corp., have been charged with criminal securities fraud for
allegedly inflating sales figures, and the former CEO of a third
company, David Lepejian of HPL Technologies Inc., has been accused by
HPL of faking the majority of HPL's fourth-quarter sales. The FBI is
investigating, and Lepejian's attorney declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Also under SEC investigation is anti-virus software firm Network
Associates Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif., which in May restated three
years of results and said it had lost an additional $22.2 million
over that time.</TE>
<TE>   This month, Neoforma Inc., a small San Jose-based Internet firm,
warned that it might be delisted from Nasdaq after announcing that it
would reduce previously reported first-quarter sales by $13.9
million. And TiVo Inc., also of San Jose, said it would restate some
expenses in the quarter ended in January.</TE>
<TE>   The valley has escaped more serious scandals partly because many
of the worst practices were perfected by Internet companies that have
vanished, legal experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Defunct companies are a less inviting target for investigators
because there is little or no money to recover and less of a danger
that others are being harmed, said FBI Special Agent Andrew Black.</TE>
<TE>   "Prevention is critical. So if a company is still viable, that's
important," said Black, a spokesman for the FBI in Northern
California.</TE>
<TE>   Still-viable companies of all sizes are going under the
microscope, and prosecutors will first look at the biggest possible
offenders.</TE>
<TE>   To carry out their work, the authorities need three things:
staffing power, wrongdoing and witnesses. All three are coming
together.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has been adding to its white-collar crime team in the Bay
Area, and the SEC's national enforcement budget will jump 75% next
year under a recently passed reform bill.</TE>
<TE>   Wrongdoing remains a part of the ordinary landscape, according to
a survey released this month by CFO Magazine. About 5% of the
respondents volunteered that in their judgment, their own companies
had violated generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.
Nearly 10% said they had released pro forma earnings without
connecting them to GAAP results, a practice the SEC has condemned.</TE>
<TE>   And almost 7% said they excluded debt from their balance sheets by
using special-purpose entities like those that tripped up Enron (that
figure includes only those companies that were protecting outside
investors in the special-purpose entities, which under accounting
rules means the debt must be disclosed.)</TE>
<TE>   "If they looked hard enough in the valley, they could find a lot
of fraud," said Stanford University accounting professor Karen
Nelson.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses also are getting easier to find, law enforcement
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   With so many valley executives out of their jobs or stuck with
worthless options, fewer have financial incentives to keep quiet
about missteps by their employers.</TE>
<TE>   One result: A first-of-its-kind securities fraud hotline to the
FBI in San Francisco was established this month and netted 160 calls
in its first 10 days. So many good tips poured in that the national
headquarters is considering taking over the phone line, Black said.</TE>
<TE>   About 60% of the calls are from investors unhappy that they lost
money, while other tips probably will aid existing probes. But a
surprising number are giving fresh leads on fraud in the valley.</TE>
<TE>   "Several of them are very promising with regard to initiating new
investigations," Black said, adding that there is a likelihood of
more charges in the future.</TE>
<TE>   A major trouble area for technology companies is pro forma
earnings--sometimes derided as "earnings before bad stuff." In those
figures, used by such valley stalwarts as Yahoo Inc., EBay Inc. and
Cisco Systems Inc., companies tout financial performance based on the
criteria they pick, excluding costs such as amortization, payroll
taxes on stock options and merger expenses. All three companies have
defended their reporting as providing a better picture of their
operating results and have started to include more information.</TE>
<TE>   If the SEC considers pro forma releases misleading, it can sue or
force a settlement, as it did for the first time this year with Trump
Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts Inc. The SEC won a cease-and-desist order
over a 1999 Trump news release that the SEC said "cited pro forma
figures to tout the company's purportedly positive results of
operations but failed to disclose that those results were primarily
attributable to an unusual one-time gain."</TE>
<TE>   A second danger spot is barter deals, which have been out of
fashion since accounting rules on the issue were tightened. Dot-com
companies were notorious for inflating revenue by trading advertising
space on one another's Web sites and counting the swaps as regular
sales. Yahoo said it has kept barter revenue under 10% of its total,
but the figure was more than 30% at smaller firms such as
Fashionmall.com Inc.</TE>
<TE>   From barter, it's a small jump to so-called round-trip deals like
those at energy firms and allegedly at Global Crossing, where
capacity on telecommunications networks was traded between companies,
boosting revenue figures.</TE>
<TE>   But the type of deal that may be most emblematic of the valley's
methods are the sort of multi-part alliances that, until recently,
were prevalent at AOL Time Warner Inc. AOL, which recently restated
some results, said the accounting errors it found constituted a small
percentage of its reported revenue.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the AOL arrangements now under SEC scrutiny, the company
struck a complex deal with PurchasePro Inc. of Las Vegas, agreeing to
resell PurchasePro's online marketplace software and taking warrants
to buy PurchasePro stock, which AOL recorded as revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the largest companies in Silicon Valley had complicated
alliances with other firms, some of which are now in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "With some of the technology companies, you looked at the customer
list and the partner list, and they would be the same," said Bob
O'Connor, CEO of Softrax Corp., which sells software for tracking
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   That type of arrangement was the norm three years ago, said
Suzanne Bell, a technology transactions lawyer with Silicon Valley
law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati.</TE>
<TE>   "In some respects, maybe what AOL was doing was not all that
different from what a lot of other companies in that position were
doing," Bell said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Sun Microsystems Inc. and AOL formed a now-defunct
joint venture in 1998. AOL promised to buy $500 million of Sun goods
and services as Sun committed to pay AOL $350 million in marketing,
licensing and advertising fees. Sun declined to detail how it
accounted for the deal or say whether the SEC had asked it for more
information as part of its inquiry into AOL.</TE>
<TE>   And Hewlett-Packard Co., like Sun a computer maker based in Palo
Alto, had a deep relationship with Denver telecom firm Qwest
Communications International Inc., which is under scrutiny by the SEC
and federal prosecutors looking into how Qwest recorded revenue from
capacity swaps with Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   HP leased Qwest's Web hosting facilities and bought broadband
connections while selling Qwest hardware and management services. HP
spokeswoman Rebeca Robboy said no barter was involved, and a former
HP executive who worked on the deal said it and other HP ventures had
conservative accounting, excluding any stock gains from revenue
figures.</TE>
<TE>   "Because the market was so hot, the name of the game was to get
big quickly," said the executive, who spoke on condition he not be
named. "It was basically a land grab, so you found as many
partnerships as possible."</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing inherently wrong with such alliances, but they
provide more opportunities for misclassifying revenue, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the special kind of transactions we saw were definitely
part of this big bubble of excess," said Charles Mulford, an
accounting professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology. "These
methods of accounting for revenue entail judgment in application, and
what might appear to be proper application of judgment at the time
can often appear to be questionable in hindsight."</TE>
<TE>   All the regulatory and political changes have gotten the attention
of tech executives.</TE>
<TE>   Most are holding the line on one key issue, declining to record
stock option grants as an expense. Critics say the practice obscures
companies' financial performance, but there's no question that Intel
Corp., Cisco and Sun are on solid legal ground in their defiance.</TE>
<TE>   In other areas where the legal protections are slim, and seemingly
getting slimmer every day, companies are changing their ways.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of companies are running scared. No one wants to be the
next headline," Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   Executives are spending more time evaluating how solid deals are
and how they should be recorded, and outside directors are asserting
themselves more, investors said.</TE>
<TE>   The legal and regulatory shifts "give independent directors more
clout to stand up to what may have been marginal practices," said
Dick Kramlich, co-founder of Menlo Park venture firm New Enterprise
Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Barter deals are nearly gone, fewer companies rely as much on pro
forma income reports and big alliances are rarer. Some companies even
seem to be competing over which can disclose the most. But in a twist
to the trend, accounting experts fear some companies may be using the
changing sentiment to gain an unfair advantage: Firms that have made
massive restatements of past revenues or profits, including Qwest and
Xerox Corp., may be setting the stage for numbers that look much
better down the road.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the restatements have been overly conservative. They're
banking earnings for future periods," Mulford said.</TE>
<TE>   Although few major valley firms have restated earnings, Cisco
already has made itself look better through an aggressively negative
portrayal of its assets.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco's true performance already had been hard to track because of
its rapid acquisitions, use of pro forma numbers and large option
grants, analysts complained. Just over a year ago, Cisco took a
$2.25-billion pretax charge for inventory that it said was worthless.
That triggered a spate of still-pending class-action lawsuits
accusing the company of accounting tricks and securities fraud. Cisco
said the suits are without merit.</TE>
<TE>   In the quarters since then, just as some had predicted, the
company reversed more than $700 million from that charge, increasing
its gross-profit margins.</TE>

<HD>State Senate to Examine Music Firms</HD>
<DH>Royalties: A second hearing on recording industry
accounting is planned to probe allegations that artists are being
cheated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state Senate has widened its probe of music industry accounting
practices and is investigating whether major record companies
defrauded artists out of royalties through undisclosed licensing
deals with record clubs and video channels.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate Rules Committee in Sacramento issued subpoenas late
last week seeking documents from artists' lawyers and managers to
substantiate the allegations, which first came to light at a hearing
last month called by Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier) and Sen. Kevin
Murray (D-Culver City) to examine accounting practices in the music
industry.</LD>
<LD>   During the July 23 hearing, artist representatives accused the
world's five largest music companies of collecting millions of
dollars annually from licensing deals with record clubs and video
channels never shared with artists. Attorneys also alleged that
companies employ fraudulent accounting formulas to bilk artists out
of earnings on music sold overseas.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to find out how these deals are structured and whether
artists are getting shortchanged," Murray said in an interview.
"We're also interested in determining whether companies are cheating
artists by using unfair tactics in the accounting of foreign
royalties."</TE>
<TE>   Escutia and Murray have scheduled a second hearing on the matter
Sept. 24 in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting issue is the latest wrinkle in an ongoing debate
over artists' rights in the recording industry. Performers and
musicians have complained to lawmakers that music companies use
unfair contracts that bind them longer than other California workers
and use accounting tricks that reduce their wages and health-care and
pension benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The Recording Industry Assn. of America, a Washington trade group
that represents the nation's five biggest music companies, declined
to comment on the allegations, except to say that artists are paid in
accordance with their contracts. Record executives privately say
labels do not cheat artists on music sold overseas nor do they profit
from covert licensing arrangements at artists' expense.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment attorney Don Engel, who has sued labels on behalf of
Luther Vandross, Meatloaf, Don Henley and the Dixie Chicks, told
lawmakers last month that companies routinely cheat artists out of
royalties.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Engel spelled out what he characterized as a
series of schemes perpetrated on artists by the music industry.</TE>
<TE>   Music Video Costs</TE>
<TE>   Record companies, he said, purport that music videos are
promotional tools to help generate sales of CDs. Artists are
contractually required to reimburse companies for at least half of
the cost of each promotional video before they receive a royalty
check.</TE>
<TE>   But the music giants enter into agreements with video channels
under which the music companies receive millions of dollars in
payments and other benefits, such as free advertising, that are not
disclosed to artists, Engel said.</TE>
<TE>   MTV, one of the biggest video channels, could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Artist managers and lawyers say music companies should be required
to book such licensing fees and barter arrangements as income, and
that they should be required to share that money with the artists
whose videos undergird the agreements. Otherwise, the companies
should stop requiring artists to reimburse them for video costs,
attorneys say.</TE>
<TE>   "Accountants in other businesses have a very simple term for this
kind of scheme," Engel said. "They call it double-dipping."</TE>
<TE>   Record companies disagree, saying such licensing fees are not
required to be shared with artists. They say attorneys who negotiate
contracts for artists are aware that cable video channels pay
licensing fees to record companies for the global rights to a vast
catalog of videos. Companies say fees from music video channels are
not profits, but are used to help defray investments in video
production for artists, many of whose recordings do not return a
profit.</TE>
<TE>   Record Club Pacts</TE>
<TE>   State lawmakers also intend to review alleged pacts between music
companies and record clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Record clubs were created to sell records to consumers through
mail order in rural areas at substantially reduced rates. The clubs,
owned by the same entertainment conglomerates that own several of the
music companies, manufacture and distribute CDs independently of the
record labels. Before the emergence of national distribution outlets
such as Wal-Mart and Amazon.com, clubs were considered a viable
outlet for sparking sales.</TE>
<TE>   Based on that premise, labels long ago inserted clauses in
recording contracts that require artists to accept drastically
reduced royalty rates for music sold through clubs. The contracts
also permitted clubs to give away many promotional CDs--recordings
for which artists get paid no money at all.</TE>
<TE>   Artists complain that club sales cannibalize retail sales, since
clubs sometimes sell millions of CDs by some acts. Plus, artists say,
it is difficult to determine how many CDs are manufactured by the
clubs when they audit a label's books. As a result, many artists earn
nothing or very little on CDs sold through clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Music corporations, on the other hand, pocket millions each year
from licensing fees from the clubs. Engel alleges that the companies
keep club royalty fees artificially low and said he has seen
documents indicating that the five music giants earn nearly $50
million collectively per year from club fees that are never shared
with artists.</TE>
<TE>   Record companies contend artists are paid fair royalty rates
established under their contracts. In the music business, a company's
most valuable assets are the master recordings it has acquired over
the years. Companies say club deals typically hinge on the licensing
of a company's entire catalog and are not tied to any particular work
or artist. It is for that reason, companies maintain, that club
licensing fees are not shared with individual acts.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Royalty Rates</TE>
<TE>   The third accounting area that state lawmakers intend to examine
involves the tabulation of foreign royalties.</TE>
<TE>   Engel and other attorneys maintain that music corporations use
accounting tricks to reduce payments of foreign royalties by as much
as half. Attorneys say the practice has been going on for decades and
started back in the days when companies cut licensing deals in
foreign territories with third parties, such as independent firms
that manufactured and distributed the product for a fee overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, companies inserted clauses in contracts allowing them
to deduct those distribution fees from artist royalties. Since then,
most music labels have been swallowed up by global entertainment
conglomerates, which gobbled up many of the foreign distributors.
Still, the artists say, music labels have failed to make any
adjustments in foreign royalty rates. In recent lawsuits brought by
artists, companies have refused to disclose the nature of those
manufacturing and distribution agreements overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Artists' attorneys say companies also collude with the same
foreign distributors to establish fictitious retail prices designed
to reduce artist royalty rates overseas. In some territories, they
deduct a manufacturing tax. And in others, they deduct a value added
tax, even though they receive credits for such taxes. Attorneys say
some companies also deduct a packaging charge based on the fictitious
retail price before computing the artist royalties.</TE>
<TE>   Using these and other tactics, companies routinely misrepresent
the money owed to artists on sales of music overseas, attorneys say.
They say some artists have discovered in audits that they were paid
about half of what they earned. And though most contracts grant audit
rights to artists, companies refuse to turn over manufacturing
records, copies of agreements with foreign distributors or to
disclose the convoluted formulas used to determine foreign royalty
rates.</TE>
<TE>   Companies have said they pay fair royalties on music sold abroad.
Companies also say it is impossible to generalize about how overseas
royalties are computed.</TE>
<TE>   "The music industry's current accounting system is sorely lacking
in transparency," says Greg Hessinger, the national executive
director of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists
union, who testified before the state Senate Judiciary Committee in
July. "And until the labels recognize that artists have an inherent
right to be given a clear accounting of what they are owed, people
will continue to have the perception that they are being cheated."</TE>

<HD>Universal May Be Cutting Costs by Seeking Financial
Partners</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although Vivendi Universal continues its yearlong financial slide,
Universal Pictures has seven films starting production in the early
fall--a hefty outlay of expenses for any studio, much less one that
is owned by a company in the throes of a liquidity crisis.</LD>
<LD>   It's business as usual, insist several Hollywood producers working
with the studio. And because it costs less to keep a studio up and
running than it would to restart a moribund operation, it's also
smart business, according to one former Universal studio executive.</LD>
<LD>   But beneath that veneer of normality, and behind that
$12.5-million check written to "Spider-Man" star Tobey Maguire to
play a lead role in the upcoming "Seabiscuit," the studio is starting
to be weighed down by Vivendi's financial troubles, sources said.</LD>
<TE>   It appears that Vivendi Universal Entertainment Chairman Barry
Diller is pressuring the studio to spend less money across the board,
sources said. And one cost-cutting measure is a tactic that Universal
has tried to avoid: seeking financing partners in exchange for
various film rights, including the right to sell the film in foreign
countries as well as the video, DVD and television rights.</TE>
<TE>   "They are really struggling," said one producer, who, like
everyone interviewed for this story, declined to be identified. "They
are looking for a financial partner on [nearly] every movie they make
now."</TE>
<TE>   A studio spokesman downplayed suggestions that the studio was
cutting costs. Selling off rights is not unprecedented, he added,
noting that DreamWorks was a financial partner on Universal's "A
Beautiful Mind."</TE>
<TE>   Diller and other Universal executives declined to be interviewed
for this story. Diller is believed to be working on a plan to spin
off Vivendi's U.S. entertainment assets into a new entertainment
company that could be launched in a public offering, Wall Street
sources said. Diller hopes to convince current Vivendi Chairman
Jean-Rene Fourtou that the venture would help solve the company's
overall financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   Sources, however, say new pressure from Diller is behind Universal
executives' current talks with other studios about partnering on two
big-budget movies: "Seabiscuit," directed by Gary Ross, and
"Intolerable Cruelty," a feature from the producing-directing
partnership of Joel and Ethan Coen that would star George Clooney and
Catherine Zeta-Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Several other films in production this year are co-financed, but
the studio spokesman stressed that the partnerships were not made
solely to limit the studio's financial exposure.</TE>
<TE>   Universal joined with DreamWorks to finance the extremely
expensive "Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat" with "Austin Powers" star
Mike Myers, at Myers' request.</TE>
<TE>   Independent production company Spyglass Entertainment is
Universal's financial partner on the upcoming $80-million Jim Carrey
movie "Bruce Almighty"--which will be directed by Tom Shadyac--as
part of a make-good deal on "Firefly," the disappointing Kevin
Costner movie also directed by Shadyac. And 20th Century Fox is
co-financing a film intended to be a sweeping historical epic,
"Alexander the Great," starring Leonardo DiCaprio, to secure the
services of Fox-based director Baz Luhrmann.</TE>
<TE>   For Universal Pictures Chairman Stacey Snider, any new pressure to
secure film financing partners would be deja vu.</TE>
<TE>   Under previous Universal owner Edgar Bronfman Jr., Snider was
ordered to cut spending by selling off international rights to movies
such as "Erin Brockovich" and "American Pie," rights that, in
retrospect, would have been wise to keep, since the films were
money-making hits.</TE>
<TE>   When former Vivendi Chairman Jean-Marie Messier acquired the
studio, he reversed course, directing Snider to dramatically limit
the practice. As a result, the studio has fully benefited from the
box-office success of "The Mummy" and other hits, including the
sequel to "American Pie." In its second-quarter financial results,
Vivendi portrayed the studio as one of its most profitable units.</TE>
<TE>   If the studio is trying to conserve cash by selling off rights,
the result could be a reduction in revenue, but that would not show
up on the company's balance sheet for at least two years.</TE>
<TE>   Despite rumors of new cost-cutting pressures, producers working
with Universal say they haven't noticed Snider changing her
aggressive, hands-on running of the studio.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't seen anything slow down," said one producer with
several projects in development at the studio, including two scripts
bought just recently.</TE>
<TE>   A week ago, Universal signed Ben Stiller to star in a major comedy
for Jersey Films written and directed by "Meet the Parents"
screenwriter John Hamburg. Also recently, the studio agreed to make
"Van Helsing," a big-budget special-effects vampire movie directed by
Stephen Sommers and starring Hugh Jackman, which will start filming
in January 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is a chill, I don't feel it," said one producer.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi May Sell U.S. Units in Effort to Exit From
Hollywood</HD>
<DH>Media: A need for cash plus wariness about the industry
drives search for buyers, some analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal's dire balance sheet isn't the only driving force
behind the company's apparent desire to sell, or spin off, its U.S.
entertainment businesses.</LD>
<LD>   Most company observers think the French media giant is sniffing
out buyers not only to raise cash but because the new Gallic board
members know little about the media business and share a suspicion of
Hollywood, both as a cultural export and a business investment.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, despite the success of Universal Pictures, many in France
viewed former Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier's spectacular ouster
last month as another example of French companies flaming out in
Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   "It's well-established opinion in France that it's not possible
for French people to play an active role in Hollywood," said
Jean-Paul Pierret, manager of the Paris brokerage house Natexis
Capital. "The French have never considered Universal part of the
French culture. I don't think they want to keep any presence in this
kind of business."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever restructuring plan Vivendi's board adopts, one thing is
clear: The company ultimately is expected to dismantle the sprawling
global media empire that  Messier built on a strategy that confounded
investors and left Vivendi with crippling debts.</TE>
<TE>   A plan could be voted upon as early as the board's next meeting
Sept. 25.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds to me like their thinking is: Give to France what is
France's and give to America what belongs to America," said New York
money manager Mario Gabelli, whose clients own more than 4 million
shares  of Vivendi. "What do we know best? Cegetel [telecom], Canal
Plus [pay TV company] and Vivendi Environnement [water]. What do we
want Hollywood for?"</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi CEO Jean-Rene Fourtou recently told employees that the
company would not   sell Vivendi Universal Entertainment. That's
possible, given the bleak financial markets and Fourtou's eagerness
to recoup some of the huge losses Vivendi shareholders have
sustained, some analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   But Vivendi may, for example, decide to be a major stakeholder in
a company that would be spun off. Barry Diller, chairman of Vivendi
Universal Entertainment, is said to be working on such a plan.</TE>
<TE>   That scenario might be appealing to the new stewards of Vivendi,
who have little knowledge of the U.S. media business. Fourtou, for
example, spent much of his career at the chemical and pharmaceutical
company Rhone-Poulenc and in the last few weeks has been trying to
acquaint himself with Universal's music and movie businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the background of Fourtou and the management team
they've brought in, they are very French, closely tied to the
government and have no experience in the media sector," said Mark
Harrington, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. "I think that's an
indication as to their intentions."</TE>
<TE>   And unlike Messier, who went out of his way to woo Wall Street by
quickly moving to New York and publicly embracing America, Fourtou
has exhibited no such tendencies. In fact, Fourtou, who represents
the French business elite that Messier so offended, will pay his
first visit to the New York office next month. And in a move that
disappointed Wall Street, Fourtou reported the company's second half
results under French, not U.S., accounting standards.</TE>
<TE>   The Vivendi board itself embodies many of the cultural tensions
that came to a boil during Messier's tumultuous tenure. The board's
French and North American factions bickered for months about the
company's strategy in the face of its falling stock price before they
finally found one thing they could  agree upon. Led by the Bronfman
family of Canada, the board toppled Messier in a dramatic boardroom
coup last month. Not many expect to see such unity again on the
14-member board, which is dominated by the French.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an unworkable, unholy alliance that won't last," said
Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, associate dean of the Yale School of Management,
who has expertise in French business. "The only person who could have
blended these cultures was Messier, and he failed. A breakup is
inevitable."</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's French board members certainly are keenly aware of the
long list of French companies that have bombed in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was French bank Credit Lyonnais, which suffered huge
losses in Hollywood in the early 1990s after a number of loans to
production companies soured. After foreclosing on a loan, the former
state-owned bank was forced to take control of the Hollywood studio
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. in 1992. Four years later, Lyonnais sold MGM
for $1.3 billion after investing almost twice that amount in it.</TE>
<TE>   Before Vivendi bought it, Canal Plus, the leading European pay TV
company, was once a big financier of Hollywood movies. In the early
1990s, Canal Plus invested in the now-defunct Carolco Pictures and
also took a hit on a much-ballyhooed partnership with Arnon Milchan's
Regency International Pictures and Warner Bros. After losing
millions, the company announced it was pulling out of Hollywood in
1995, although it remains a Hollywood investor and one of the biggest
buyers of Hollywood movies in Europe. Recently, its deal to finance
the movie company run by onetime super agent Michael Ovitz fizzled.</TE>
<TE>   One of Vivendi's newest and most influential board members, Claude
Bebear, also knows too well the perils of Hollywood. French insurance
giant Axa, of which he is chairman, was a key player in film
financing from 1994 to 1998, when the company wrote $2-billion worth
of insurance policies guaranteeing that banks would be paid even if
film revenue fell short and didn't cover costs. Axa covered more than
100 movies, including "The Saint," "U-Turn" and "The Mirror Has Two
Faces." Despite huge premiums, the policies were a big loser for Axa.
The company took a $1-billion reserve against losses and is embroiled
in a lawsuit accusing the Hollywood bankers of fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal executives already have begun exploratory talks
with several companies interested in Vivendi's American entertainment
businesses, according to sources familiar with the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The prospective deals could involve the outright sale of Vivendi's
movie, television and theme park properties or the creation of an
entertainment company. Among those who have expressed interest are
cable industry magnate John Malone, who owns nearly 4% of Vivendi and
General Electric's NBC television network.</TE>
<TE>   Persistent speculation on Wall Street also has DreamWorks SKG
playing a role, although partner David Geffen has vehemently denied
any interest.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear what proposal  Vivendi's board will accept--and how
quickly  the company will be able to carry it out. Any sale or merger
could be slowed by a quagmire of tax and legal complications
associated with untangling the complex acquisitions Messier
orchestrated, sources say.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Fourtou has given conflicting signals of his intentions.
For example, he announced his plan to unload Houghton Mifflin just
two weeks after telling employees in an e-mail it was not on the
block. Fourtou further puzzled investors when he told employees and
shareholders recently Vivendi may  increase its stake in the water
business, another reversal of Messier's strategy.</TE>
<TE>   It was in that e-mail that he said Vivendi Universal Entertainment
would not be sold. But Vivendi's balance sheet could ultimately force
the matter.</TE>
<TE>   To stem a cash crisis, Fourtou has pledged to secure a nearly
$2-billion loan and raise $9.8 billion over the next two years from
the sale of mostly non-core assets, including Houghton Mifflin, a 10%
stake in EchoStar Communications and the Italian pay TV company
Telepiu.</TE>
<TE>   Even after those sales, however, Vivendi would still be several
billion dollars short of the $9.8-billion target, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "Vivendi will fall shy of its target and will inevitably be forced
to swallow its pride and commit to selling one of its core assets,"
predicted Michael Nathanson, media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in
New York.</TE>

<DH>Lobbyist shines as head of the industry's main trade group,
but challenges mount</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With his six cell phones and million-dollar salary, Tom Wheeler
stands out even among Washington's army of high-powered lobbyists.</LD>
<LD>   His communications arsenal and hefty pay--among the highest of any
Washington lobbyist--underscore his rise from Fuller brush salesman
to the top ranks of Washington's influence peddlers as president of
the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Assn.</LD>
<LD>   During his 10 years as head of the group, Wheeler, 56, has helped
the wireless industry recover from near-crippling allegations that
cell phones cause cancer, successfully lobbied federal lawmakers to
roll back state and local regulation of mobile carriers and
outmaneuvered the Pentagon to win the transfer of hundreds of
megahertz of valuable wireless airwaves from the Defense Department
to commercial carriers. The latter move has helped fuel a huge
expansion of the mobile phone market, which has 137 million
subscribers.</LD>
<TE>   "Tom Wheeler is the rock star of telecom," said Pat Mitchell,
president of the Public Broadcasting Service, an Alexandria,
Va.-based trade group. "He's always the one that shakes things up a
bit ... and makes people listen to what he has to say."</TE>
<TE>   But this year, Wheeler's leadership is being tested as local,
state and federal lawmakers come under pressure to crack down on the
industry amid safety concerns and spreading financial calamity that
has plunged wireless carriers into debt.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 16, New York City Councilman Philip Reed introduced a
measure to ban cell phones in public places throughout the city,
including libraries, movie theaters and museums, saying the devices
are "distracting" and "a public nuisance." The measure, which has
little chance of passing, comes less than a year after the state made
it illegal to use a hand-held cell phone while operating a motor
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, federal regulators are pushing initiatives that
would require the wireless industry to spend billions of dollars to
expand capacity and offer new services.</TE>
<TE>   More ominous, lawmakers such as Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.)
and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) are resurrecting cell phone safety
concerns and pressuring Federal Communications Commission Chairman
Michael K. Powell to protect consumers from financially unstable
telecom providers.</TE>
<TE>   During the industry's boom times, Wheeler kept lawmakers and
regulators at bay with a powerful message: Unfettered by heavy
government regulation, the wireless industry has boosted the nation's
economy over the last decade and produced tens of thousands of jobs.</TE>
<TE>   But with industry growth slowing and regulators angling for a
crackdown, Wheeler will need to shift gears. He must seek out
industry allies, leverage the political clout of the nation's
wireless subscribers and secure more precious airwaves so the
industry can continue to grow, colleagues and analysts say. Many
think Wheeler, who already has broadened the cellular association's
core membership to include powerful technology companies such as
Microsoft Corp., is more than up to the task of fending off industry
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "Tom can stick the knife in one of his rivals and the rival feels
he has been patted on the back," said former FCC Chairman Reed E.
Hundt. Wheeler describes his political survival instincts more
succinctly: "When you're losing the battle," he said, "change the
rules."</TE>
<TE>   Wheeler says that although wireless carriers support efforts to
increase cell phone safety and competition in the industry, many
government get-tough efforts are ill-advised. He said looming
government mandates to create a $1-billion phone number conservation
plan as well as new technology to pinpoint the location of a mobile
user dialing 911 "take millions of dollars away from what customers
say is their No. 1 request, and that's better service quality."</TE>
<TE>   The son of an Ohio insurance agent, Wheeler gave little thought to
Washington or communications technology while growing up. Instead, he
chose to remain in the Midwest and follow his father's path as a
salesman. Wheeler's first job out of Ohio State University was
selling Fuller brushes door to door.</TE>
<TE>   He can still recite his Fuller brush sales pitch but says it still
smarts to recall the many doors closed in his face while he was
pitching the product.</TE>
<TE>   The unpleasant encounters triggered a career change. In the early
1970s, Wheeler became a lobbyist for the Grocery Manufacturer's Assn.
in Washington and later moved on to lobby for the National Cable
Television Assn., also in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   At the TV group, he developed a keen interest in technology, and
in the early 1990s he quit the association to head the U.S. division
of a Canadian start-up that distributed computer software over cable
TV lines. Although the software sold well, the company closed down
Wheeler's unit six months after he joined.</TE>
<TE>   The experience, Wheeler said, "was kind of my welcome to the real
world." Wheeler returned to Washington lobbying, taking the helm of
the cellular association in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Some associates say Wheeler's abbreviated attempt at
entrepreneurship still eats at him and fuels his drive to succeed.
They said Wheeler learned to fulfill his entrepreneurial ambitions in
less risky and more personally rewarding ways.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, for example, Wheeler convinced the group to start
Cibernet Corp., a for-profit Washington company that provides
financial-settlement services for the $6 billion a year in fees that
subscribers pay when roaming outside their carrier's local calling
area. Wheeler is chairman of Cibernet, which has become a lucrative
venture that collects the roaming fees and re-distributes the
payments among more than 300 carriers in more than 80 countries.</TE>
<TE>   Although Cibernet is independently managed, industry sources say
Wheeler's post at a for-profit company that wireless companies depend
on for their financial survival gives him clout few other lobbyists
enjoy. Wheeler says he doesn't play favorites among carriers--going
as far as to carry wireless phones from each of the six major
providers. And he points out that computers and accountants handle
the distribution of roaming fees among carriers.</TE>
<TE>   But some think Wheeler's outside activities--he also sits on the
board of the nonprofit Wireless Foundation, which champions
educational and safety issues--detract from his primary
responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "I think sometimes Wheeler collects titles like some people
collect [college] degrees," one official said. "He's chairman of this
and president of that. I think he thinks it helps his image as a
power broker ... as a force to be dealt with."</TE>
<TE>   Although Wheeler acknowledges "I'm not a modest guy," he describes
himself as a "pacifist" who seeks reconciliation over
self-aggrandizement. As a lifelong Democrat, Wheeler says he doesn't
view telecom as a divisive partisan issue. Indeed, his free-market
ideals could mark him as a GOP loyalist.</TE>
<TE>   Wheeler cites as evidence of his pragmatic and reconciliatory side
his marriage to Carol Rouze, a onetime broadcasting industry lobbyist
whom Wheeler often opposed while he was lobbying for the cable
industry. But when Wheeler found out Rouze shared his love of
Broadway show tunes, he says, he was smitten. Their partnership has
since expanded Wheeler's interests into the arts and civic and other
causes including Project Children, a program run by Wheeler's wife
that brings young leaders from strife-torn Ireland to the U.S. for
reconciliation training.</TE>
<TE>   Wheeler credits those outside interests and experiences with
helping him to develop skills to keep his own troops in line.</TE>
<TE>   This month, for instance, Nextel Communications Inc., whose
president is chairman of the cellular group's board, has waged a
bitter fight with Wheeler and association members over Nextel's bid
to swap airwaves it controls that are causing interference with
communications devices used by police and other public safety
personnel.</TE>
<TE>   After six weeks of wrangling, Nextel--the nation's fifth-largest
wireless carrier--failed to convince the association to support its
proposal to trade some of its spectrum for other airwaves in a band
that didn't cause interference.</TE>
<TE>   "They did not like the Nextel proposal because they wanted
everyone to have an opportunity to get the spectrum," company
President Timothy M. Donahue said of other association members. "We
tried to convince them otherwise, but [in the end] we decided to let
the chips fall where they may."</TE>
<TE>   Donahue credited Wheeler for keeping a lid on the dispute,
allowing Nextel to fully air its position to the group's members. But
Wheeler also sensed when it was time to draw the line and put the
matter to a vote.</TE>
<TE>   Some, however, have grumbled that Wheeler is too inwardly focused
at a time of industry convergence and interdependence. Although the
cellular group recently opened its membership to high-tech giants
such as Microsoft and AOL Time Warner Inc., traditional long-distance
and local phone carriers complain that the association doesn't ally
itself with other telecom carriers on some critical issues that cut
across all segments of telecom.</TE>
<TE>   "He's always pointing out how different wireless is" from
everybody else, one local telephone industry official complained.</TE>
<TE>   For that, Wheeler is unapologetic. Wireless is different, he says,
noting that more than 90% of all Americans have a choice of three or
more wireless carriers compared with little or no choice of local
phone providers. He said that if the government keeps its hands off
the industry, it can continue to grow and innovate to the benefit of
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that sets the wireless industry apart is that we are
still showing significant revenue growth," Wheeler said. "But the
wireless industry has moved out of the go-go '90s where venture
capitalists said, 'We will fund your field of dreams.' "</TE>
<TE>   "I think the biggest problem is that we all tend to define
tomorrow in terms of what we know today. Particularly in a political
environment," Wheeler said. "But I've got one of the best jobs in
Washington. You get to exist at the intersection of technology and
policy in a business that is always changing."</TE>

<TE>   Position: President of the Cellular Telecommunications &amp; Internet
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Residence: Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Education: Bachelor of Science degree from Ohio State University,
1968.</TE>
<TE>   Marital status: Married to Carol Rouze</TE>
<TE>   Children: One daughter, 25, and a son, 15</TE>
<TE>   Career: After a stint as a Fuller brush salesman in Ohio in the
late 1960s and early 1970s, Wheeler became a lobbyist for the Grocery
Manufacturer's Assn. In 1976, he signed on as a lobbyist for the
National Cable Television Assn., where he later served as president
from 1979 to 1984. A history buff, Wheeler is the author of "Take
Command! Leadership Lessons From the Civil War" (Doubleday, 2001)</TE>
<TE>   On job performance: "One of the criteria of me, as a CEO, is to
have the sense of sitting in the other person's chair.... [But] one
of the things I think you'll find is that I'm not a modest guy. My
management style is to set high expectations and get out of the way
and let people meet them."</TE>
<TE>   Icebreaker: After signing up Mikhail S. Gorbachev to speak at a
cellular association convention several years ago, Wheeler canvassed
acquaintances on how to break the ice with the former Soviet leader.
Wheeler learned from his friend Pat Mitchell of the Public
Broadcasting Service that Gorbachev liked singer Frank Sinatra. So
Wheeler brought some Sinatra albums to Gorbachev's hotel room and the
two spent the evening before Gorbachev's speech enjoying Old Blue
Eyes.</TE>

<DH>Health should trump money: Curtail soda sales at public
schools.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In recent months, high-profile reports on health policy have sounded
the alarm about the grave risks of our nation's bulging waistline.
According to the California Department of Health Services, more than
60% of adults in Los Angeles are overweight. Perhaps more foreboding,
more than 40% of school-age children weigh too much. Given the
corresponding health risks--overweight and obese children are at
greater risk for long-term problems such as cardiovascular disease,
Type-2 diabetes, asthma and certain cancers--it is imperative that
school districts across the nation move quickly to redress this
crisis by increasing the selection of healthful foods in school
cafeterias and reducing the availability of foods of low nutritional
value on campus.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday the Los Angeles Unified School District board will vote
on a motion to remedy the district's long-standing contradiction in
policy, wherein we preach nutritional standards but continue to sell
nutritionally deficient products. The motion calls on the LAUSD to
discontinue the sale of soft drinks on campuses during school hours
beginning in January 2004 in favor of more healthful alternatives.</LD>
<TE>   Soft drinks are leading culprits in the obesity epidemic because
they contribute significantly to caloric intake. A recent study found
that for each soft drink consumed in a day, a child's risk for
obesity increased by 60%. Another study found that young, active
girls who drank sodas were five times more likely to fracture bones
than girls who did not.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, the argument against removing soft drinks from
LAUSD campuses has been based on the revenue that their sales
generate for cash-strapped schools, particularly for extracurricular
activities and supplies. Indeed, soft drink contracts provide
thousands of dollars per year in commissions. These contracts are
deemed so important to soft drink companies that they pay a sizable
premium to place vending machines on campuses and thereby gain an
early foothold in "branding" the lucrative youth market.</TE>
<TE>   In light of the health risks, it should not be difficult to choose
good health over short-term monetary compensation. That the LAUSD has
chosen to allow corporate profit to eclipse its commitment to
promoting good nutrition is a blatant abdication of our
responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, this burden of risk falls heaviest on the shoulders
of low-income students of color. African American and Latino adults
have the highest rates of diabetes in the county, and the potentially
deadly Type-2 diabetes is becoming more common among black and Latino
children. Moreover, African American and Latino children (more than
80% of the LAUSD population) are at even greater risk of being
malnourished because the high-poverty communities in which many of
them live are less likely to have grocery stores with a wide
selection of fresh fruit and vegetables. In addition, according to a
2000 LAUSD study, more than 25% of children in the county do not have
access to preventive health care.</TE>
<TE>   The district's responsibility for providing healthful food on its
campuses is not an idle luxury. Children who eat more healthful diets
are more mentally alert, emotionally engaged and physically fit.
Therefore, another important aspect of the motion advocates curricula
that emphasize the relationship between health literacy, rigorous
physical education and emotional and psychological wellness.</TE>
<TE>   We must not allow the threat of lost profits to compromise our
commitment to equity, especially when healthful, revenue-generating
alternatives to soft drinks exist. A school district that doesn't
focus on the "total child" betrays its professed mission to provide a
just and equitable school environment and effectively dooms all of
its students to failure.</TE>

<HD>Musharraf Plays Rough in a Tough Neighborhood</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANAN R. LURIE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last week, President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan broke his promise
both to his nation and the world about stepping down as the strongman
of his country by October. In my interview with him last year, he was
very insistent about his democratic plans. I must admit that I was
sold on his sincerity. But with his announcement Wednesday that he
was extending his presidency five years, he flatly contradicted
himself. He chose political dishonor rather than risk being swept
aside by a tsunami of Islamic fundamentalist voters in the election
set for October.</LD>
<LD>   The Algerian example was his warning beacon. In 1990, the Islamic
Salvation Front, whose goal was nothing less than transforming
Algeria into a full-fledged religious Islamic state, won a stunning
electoral victory over the ruling socialist-military party. The
military was shocked by the success of the Islamic fundamentalists
and halted the electoral process and suspended parliament.</LD>
<LD>   The chaos and disaster that have hit Algeria since, fomented by
the fundamentalists who were cheated out of power, have cost more
than 100,000 civilian lives, officially, and probably more than
250,000, realistically.</LD>
<TE>   The difference between Pakistan and Algeria is that Musharraf, who
saw Pakistani polls heavily supporting the Islamic fundamentalists,
decided to retake full control before rather than after the
elections.</TE>
<TE>   He has been a military persona since a young age, and his
reactions are swift and self-preserving. He knew that by joining the
United States' fight against the Taliban and Osama bin Laden, he had
crossed the line forever in the eyes of his fanatic Muslim brothers.
But he also knew what could have happened if he had not done so.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf now faces what almost every Muslim leader confronts: the
danger of being weakened by the democratic process that the West
cherishes. Islam is a very tough, no-nonsense neighborhood in which
you have to be strong to survive as a leader. The potential of
assassination is skyrocketing for every Muslim leader, especially in
Muslim societies toying with democracy. The masses see equality as a
dangerous Western tool because, for starters, it grants women
equality with men ("one person, one vote") and because Islam simply
cannot separate itself from the state; basically it is the state.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf knows too well that being a dictator in a Muslim country
is nothing to be ashamed of. The problem is the big white brother of
the West with the grand democratic ideas who might frown over some of
his actions. However, right now white brother needs him much more
than he needs white brother.</TE>

<HD>Stuck With a Poor Education When Pro Dreams Evaporate</HD>
<DH>For athletes' sake, the college system must reform.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT B. SLOAN JR.</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Summer is the customary time for university presidents to try yet
again to suggest substantial changes to college sports, particularly
football and basketball.</LD>
<LD>   All too often, there is much discussion but little action. This
year, however, some significant reforms of academic standards and
college sports may be in the offing.</LD>
<LD>   Here is the tragic flaw of Division I football and basketball
programs: Too often we recruit men and women who, though great
athletes, find it difficult to succeed academically.</LD>
<TE>   At the end of their college careers--when their dreams of
professional success are all too inevitably gone--such players often
feel used up and then sent on their way with little education and
even less hope for the future.</TE>
<TE>   The patterns and structures of college athletics are driven by all
kinds of motives, many of them good, some of them no reasons for
pride.</TE>
<TE>   I will confess that at my university, where graduation rates for
student athletes are significantly higher than the nationwide
percentages, there are nonetheless athletic programs about which we
are embarrassed with respect to the graduation rates.</TE>
<TE>   All of us must ask whether the system of college athletics
reflects with integrity our academic missions.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, there are too many instances where otherwise
reputable universities have graduation rates for some sports in the
teens or single digits. There are even a few institutions that have
national championship programs in sports where the graduation rate is
zero.</TE>
<TE>   Not much will change unless the universities, meaning the
presidents and their boards of trustees, establish and publish
reliable measures of academic success (or failure) in programs and
then set up a system of incentives and disincentives to reward
universities for positive efforts and punish those that perpetuate
the current, misguided system.</TE>
<TE>   We must stop the almost annual occurrence of seeing championship
teams filled with great athletes who do not attend class, are not
making any progress toward a legitimate academic degree and are not,
in any meaningful way, engaged in the rigors of higher education.</TE>
<TE>   The days when universities reap the huge benefits of athletic
success without fulfilling the mission of educational opportunity
must end.</TE>
<TE>   There are proposals now before the National Collegiate Athletic
Assn. that would require prospective student athletes to enroll in
more core courses in their high schools and universities to prove
that they are meeting certain academic standards to remain eligible
for play.</TE>
<TE>   If approved, these proposals would ultimately lead to a system of
incentives and disincentives affecting the number of scholarships
available for a program and access to the post-season play and the
accompanying dollars and prestige that brings.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the recommendations of some pundits who dismiss the entire
system as corrupt, we do not need to turn away completely from all
forms of commercialism or reject television contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Such a view is not only naive; it would diminish college
athletics. Colleges were never designed to be, nor should they be,
the minor leagues for professional programs. All our students,
including our athletes, deserve the opportunity to work with
integrity toward the intellectual and moral achievements historically
characterized by a university diploma.</TE>
<TE>   College sports programs do enormous good for student athletes and
their universities. The athletes learn discipline, concentration,
loyalty and commitment. Athletics binds the alumni with the
institutions, and students enjoy a deep sense of belonging and
exhilaration when their teams compete well and win.</TE>
<TE>   Like anything else that gets twisted or manipulated, college
athletics can also be the source of failure and even evil.</TE>
<TE>   The system can and must be improved. It is too good for us to let
it continue as it is now.</TE>

<LD>For many citizens, the notion of an American "secret court" would
appear a striking contradiction in terms. Until last week's
disclosures by Congress, few Americans were aware that our government
routinely used such a court to conduct searches of its own citizens
for the purpose of foreign intelligence gathering, searches that
would be denied as unconstitutional by any conventional court.
However, this little-known court released to Congress a rare public
opinion chastising Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and disclosing dozens of
secret violations by the Justice Department.</LD>
<LD>   Most alarming is the disclosure of a plan by Ashcroft to change
the role of the court in spying on citizens. Not only would the court
no longer have foreign intelligence gathering as its primary purpose,
but Ashcroft's prosecutors would be in direct control of the use and
dissemination of information gathered on citizens.</LD>
<LD>   The opinion released Thursday details more than 75 cases in which
the Justice Department supplied false information to the court to
carry out secret searches. These are only the cases that the Justice
Department itself has located and admitted to. Moreover, the court
rejected Ashcroft's effort to change its role in a way that would
allow him to effectively circumvent the 4th Amendment in future
searches of citizens.</LD>
<TE>   The plan would allow a greater array of cases to bypass the
federal courts, be exempted from basic constitutional requirements
and then be handled in total secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   The plan would create a one-stop convenience store for searches,
avoiding the nasty constitutional traffic created by the nation's
framers in requirements of probable cause and meaningful judicial
review.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most chilling aspect of this opinion is not its
disclosures but its source. This court has never rejected an
application for surveillance despite more than 1,000 such
applications each year. It has all the trappings and little of the
substance of a real court. There is even a secret appellate court,
which, until now, has never considered a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   During my brief stint at the National Security Agency, I had
occasion to appear before this secret court--known as the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, court.</TE>
<TE>   My first reaction was that it appeared like a bad set for a
Maxwell Smart episode, with a series of doors and secret codes. The
room that is sometimes portrayed as America's Star Chamber would make
most traffic courts look grand in comparison. I'm not sure if it was
the gravity of the actions taken by the court or the casual
atmosphere that most disturbed me.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, FISA was enacted as a reform in the wake of the
Watergate scandal. Richard Nixon previously asserted the right to
conduct unilateral searches in the name of national security, and
Congress sought a compromise to create some form of legal process and
review. It was a compromise that many would come to regret. While the
framers required the government to satisfy probable cause in any
search or seizure, FISA allows secret searches of citizens without
meeting that standard.</TE>
<TE>   That was not the only change.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal law, a citizen who is subject to a government
wiretap is eventually notified of the intrusion. This creates a
certain deterrent of government abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Under FISA, a team can enter your home, quickly scrub your
computer, wire your house, install a device to record every keystroke
on your computer and rifle your files. There is little deterrent of
abusive because the victims are unaware that their privacy has been
invaded.</TE>
<TE>   It is not surprising that FISA has become the destination of
choice for investigators with a hankering for a search but a paucity
of evidence. While these searches were meant to be the exception
rather than the rule, FISA eavesdropping orders now outnumber
conventional ones.</TE>
<TE>   In its opinion, the court acknowledges that "many hundreds of
citizens" have been searched under its secret orders. Yet even this
court could not stomach what Ashcroft demanded in secret papers.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft went to the secret court to declare that, among other
changes, it would now "be used primarily for a law enforcement
purpose" and not its original foreign intelligence-gathering purpose.
The court refused to sign on to such an interpretation and refused to
allow the expanded use of FISA material. Undeterred, Ashcroft is now
appealing to the secret appellate court (once anyone can remember
where it is or who is on it).</TE>
<TE>   Abandoning its past custom of absolute secrecy, the court released
this opinion as a warning to citizens. We should not expect the
luxury of a second shot across the bow.</TE>

<LD>Traditionally, summer is a good time for politicians to take voters'
pulse at the grass roots, play golf and sell favorite programs to
relaxed constituents away from the capital's constant sparring and
media spotlight.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush is at home in Texas and Canada's Prime Minister
Jean Chretien is home too, in Quebec. While Bush heard Republican
rumblings over his proposed "regime change" in Iraq, Chretien faced a
bubbling revolt that could force his resignation from the ruling
Liberal Party's leadership and the prime minister's office. However,
a crabby Chretien peremptorily announced he would retire in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Chretien fussed all summer over maneuverings by former Finance
Minister Paul Martin to succeed him. Chretien also made some
little-noticed remarks about the United States that could raise
American eyebrows. As part of their identity, many Canadians maintain
a mental list of differences with Americans, much like family photos
in a wallet.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, it seems strangely gratuitous for the embattled leader of
America's top trade partner and a key anti-terror ally to have
provided a local party gathering in Chicoutimi last week with an
unsolicited, distinctly uncomplimentary list of political differences
with the United States. Imagine the furor if Bush grumbled publicly
in Ohio about Canadian corruption and lack of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   Chretien talked about his own agenda for a bit, then launched into
this: "Our parliamentary system is different from that of the United
States, where there is no party discipline. Where members of Congress
do not run on national platforms. Where special interests pour money
into individual congressional races. Where the administration cannot
deliver an agreement [with Canada] on softwood lumber because it has
to give in to the wishes of some senator who owes his election to
American lumber producers and who threatens to use his power as
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee to block other legislation
of importance to the president." (The senator: clearly Montana's Max
Baucus, not a Canada fan.)</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a system where important judicial positions remain
vacant for years because of the political games and ideological tests
of Congress," the prime minister continued. "We don't have a system
where the administration tells the world it doesn't like the farm
bill. But [it] has to give in to congressmen, who are subject not to
party discipline, but to the discipline of lobbyists and the money of
special-interest groups. Now that is a real democratic deficit. And
we don't need it in Canada."</TE>
<TE>   Now, we're unaware that anyone has asked Ottawa to adopt the
political system of its raucous neighbor. But we might suggest that
Chretien has a relaxation deficit and needs a wee break at some lake
before Quebec's summer is gone. Also, maybe switch to decaf.</TE>

<LD>Fathers who drive expensive cars while their children limp to school
in last year's shoes should start looking over their shoulders. Going
to another state to evade paying back child support could land them
in federal prison and subject them to steep fines as well.</LD>
<LD>   Federal agents last month nabbed 61 deadbeat dads who collectively
owed millions of dollars. The widely publicized sweep was a first, a
three-day hunt in 25 states, plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.</LD>
<LD>   Six of those arrested were in California or had children in the
state. Eight more of the most flagrant deadbeats, including one
mother, were collared this month. A few delinquent parents heard
about the captures and turned themselves in.</LD>
<TE>   Government officials expect some who owe big money to surrender or
make good. That was the aim of the sweep, and the arrests should
continue as long as needed to get the message across.</TE>
<TE>   For the crime of falling behind $10,000 or more in court-ordered
support and leaving the state to avoid payment, delinquent parents
could spend two years in prison and face a fine of up to $250,000.
That possibility should limber up the ex's check-writing hand.</TE>
<TE>   The agents get their authority from the Deadbeat Parents
Punishment Act, which President Clinton signed in 1998. The Bush
administration called for aggressive enforcement, authorizing
investigators from the Department of Health and Human Services to
arrest the worst delinquents.</TE>
<TE>   Working with U.S. marshals and state and local authorities, the
agents found people like a doctor in the Northern Mariana Islands
with a six-figure income who owed $86,000 in back support for her two
daughters in Ohio. She awaits extradition.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Gatos, Calif., agents tracked down a disbarred lawyer who
writes software. He had moved from Pennsylvania, where his child
lives, to Indiana, Colorado and California while his child support
bill expanded, to $86,000 in this case too.</TE>
<TE>   The agents don't look for financially broke parents, who, even if
caught, could never catch up. They look for those with good incomes
and assets.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not asking these people to be good parents. They don't have
to take their kids to Disneyland or nurse them when they get sick in
the middle of the night," said Catherine Harris, a Health and Human
Services spokeswoman. "But they do have to pay their court-ordered
child support."</TE>
<TE>   Millions of parents renege on child support. Two-thirds of the
delinquents live in a different state from their sons and daughters,
according to federal statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Child support isn't a federal debt, but running up a bill and
fleeing the state is a federal felony. The dragnet telegraphs a
message: Settle up. Make a payment plan. Surrender before you get
caught.</TE>

<LD>"Involuntary commitment." Without any context, the term sounds
chilling, a throwback to half a century ago, when greedy relatives or
uncaring communities sometimes confined people to state psychiatric
hospitals simply because they were misfits. There, they were
controlled with medications that often turned patients into virtual
zombies, blurring their vision, stiffening their muscles and dulling
their memories.</LD>
<LD>   Such "snake pits" have been shuttered for decades, and psychiatric
medications have come on the market that clarify rather than stupefy
the mind.</LD>
<LD>   Now, some 40 years after abusive practices were halted, the
pendulum has swung to the other extreme. Current law prohibits the
forced medication of the mentally ill unless they are deemed in
immediate danger of harming themselves or others. That rigid standard
has left law enforcement and mental health professionals, not to
mention families, without any way of helping people before a serious
mental illness spirals into tragedy.</LD>
<TE>   Just ask the family of Laura Wilcox, a 19-year-old high school
valedictorian who was gunned down a year and a half ago in the
Northern California town of Nevada City by a man whose delusional
schizophrenia had gone untreated.</TE>
<TE>   After four years of uphill fighting by Assemblywoman Helen Thomson
(D-Davis), California appears to be on the threshold of passing a law
that will respect crucial civil liberties while allowing authorities
to use common sense in treating the mentally ill who resist help
because they are mentally ill.</TE>
<TE>   After much debate between civil libertarians, family members and
mental health professionals, all of them proposing conflicting
amendments to the bill, the Legislature has arrived at a wise
compromise: to allow involuntary treatment of people in need of help
and unable to make rational decisions concerning care. The decision
would be made by judges after careful consultation with mental health
professionals and family members.</TE>
<TE>   The final bill deftly balances an individual's right to freedom
with society's responsibility to protect the safety and foster the
health of all its citizens. The full Senate will vote on the bill, AB
1421, as early as today. The Senate should resoundingly approve it
and Gov. Gray Davis should sign it, making "Laura's law," for so long
a noble aspiration, a reality.</TE>

<HD>CEOs Paid 70% More at Firms Under Scrutiny</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Top officers at 23 companies made well more
than average, according to a study.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The top officers of 23 major companies currently under investigation
for accounting irregularities were paid 70% more than the average
chief executive officer of a large U.S. company, according to a new
study.</LD>
<LD>   The study by the nonprofit advocacy group United for a Fair
Economy is aimed at focusing more attention on the increasingly
controversial practice of paying top executives with stock options
that become valuable only if the company's market price rises--giving
executives the incentive to inflate profits to drive up their
companies' stock prices, critics say.</LD>
<LD>   "The pressure to be ever more aggressive in accounting
presentations and distort earnings to keep the stock price rising is
largely related to the incentives set forward for executives," said
Scott Klinger, co-director for responsible wealth at Boston-based
United for a Fair Economy.</LD>
<TE>   "The Enrons and the WorldComs were the most egregious examples of
this, but we think the stock option piece [of compensation] has
allowed executives to become very rich while destroying jobs,
destroying shareholder value and weakening the companies."</TE>
<TE>   The 23 executives scrutinized by United for a Fair Economy
received an average pay package of $62 million during the three-year
period from 1999 through 2001, compared with an average package of
$36 million for the chief executives of 365 of the nation's largest
companies, according to the study.</TE>
<TE>   The most highly paid executive on the list, Tyco's L. Dennis
Kozlowski, earned $331 million in salary and stock gains over the
period, according to the study, which is due to be released today.
Kozlowski has resigned and is facing charges of tax evasion.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco spokesman Gary Holmes said the company is conducting an
investigation into issues related to Kozlowski's departure and could
not comment.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest Communications International Inc., Enron Corp., AOL Time
Warner Inc., WorldCom Inc., Halliburton Co. and Global Crossing Ltd.
also ranked high on the list of companies that paid their executives
handsomely but are now grappling with questions from investors and
regulators regarding their reported financial results. All 23 are
reported to be facing inquiries by agencies such as the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice and the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   The study focused only on companies that had market
capitalizations of at least $1 billion at some point during the
three-year period. Many of the companies have since filed for
bankruptcy, laid off the bulk of their workers and left their
investors with worthless shares.</TE>
<TE>   Together, the 23 companies targeted by the study paid their CEOs
$1.4 billion over the three-year period, while laying off 162,000
workers and losing some $530 billion in market capitalization,
according to United for a Fair Economy.</TE>
<TE>   The factor that linked the companies most closely is their
aggressive use of stock options--rights to buy company shares at a
set price in the future, Klinger said.</TE>
<TE>   These options have become increasingly controversial in recent
years, in part because of the massive paydays enjoyed by top
executives at companies such as WorldCom and Enron when they cashed
out years' worth of options--often just ahead of sharp declines in
the companies' stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor is the debate over current accounting standards
that don't require companies to show stock options as a compensation
expense in the financial statements provided to shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   These same companies do write off the cost of providing the
options on their corporate tax returns, Klinger notes, creating a
growing gulf between corporations' taxable income and reported
income. From 1996 through 1998, taxable earnings of U.S. corporations
declined incrementally, while earnings reported to shareholders rose
8.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of stock-based pay plans--particularly technology
companies--maintain that stock options are the only tool small,
growing firms have to adequately compensate managers in lean years.
Making companies account for stock options as an expense would
discourage the companies from offering options to a wide swath of
employees, according to AeA, a trade group representing the
technology industry.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has promised to introduce
legislation next month aimed at forcing companies to reflect the cost
of stock options in their earnings statements, Senate staffers said
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Even more needs to be done, Klinger said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have nine proposals for reform, but the two really big ones
are that we need to expense stock options and we need to look at who
is in the board room deciding on compensation issues," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have made some minor progress recently, but boards are still
dominated by CEOs, and CEOs have a huge conflict of interest when
they are deciding on the pay of their fellow CEOs."</TE>

<HD>Growth Spurt at Intuit</HD>
<DH>In the last year, the software company has acquired six
firms and expanded its line of small-business products</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LIEDTKE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>MOUNTAIN VIEW</DL>
<LD>While most of the high-tech industry hunkers down, financial software
maker Intuit Corp. is muscling up.</LD>
<LD>   In the last year, the company behind such popular software
products as TurboTax, Quicken and QuickBooks has expanded its product
line, spent $490 million on six acquisitions and built one of the
industry's most successful online subscription services.</LD>
<LD>   The burst of activity for Mountain View-based Intuit follows Steve
Bennett's arrival as chief executive in January 2000.</LD>
<TE>   With annual revenue of more than $1 billion, Intuit wasn't exactly
dozing. But Bennett, a former executive at hard-driving General
Electric Co., spotted troubling signs of lethargy.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew this was a company that should have been doing so much
better," Bennett said. "We decided to raise the bar and challenged
everyone to start thinking in different ways."</TE>
<TE>   Besides pushing Intuit into new niches, Bennett has been
jettisoning pieces of the business that either weren't producing
adequate returns or didn't fit well with the company's new direction.</TE>
<TE>   Since Bennett's arrival, Intuit has pruned $45 million in annual
expenses from its Quicken software division, dumped its online
insurance business and sold its mortgage loan division.</TE>
<TE>   With Bennett applying the pressure, Intuit keeps raising its
financial projections while most other high-tech companies lower
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   In its fiscal year ended in July, Intuit earned $140 million on
sales of $1.36 billion. If not for charges related to its shopping
spree and other items unrelated to its ongoing business, Intuit said
its profit for the last year would have been $211 million, a 30%
improvement from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett believes that Intuit's revenue could climb by as much as
32% to $1.8 billion in the company's new fiscal year while profit
could rise by as much as 40%.</TE>
<TE>   Intuit's bright outlook amid Silicon Valley's gloom reflects
largely reliable demand for the company's tax and accounting
products.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of whether the economy is slumping, "people always have
to do their taxes and keep their books," Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   Intuit's steady performance is turning the company into a haven
for high-tech investors seeking shelter from stock market turbulence.
The company's shares Friday fell $1.94 to $45.81 on Nasdaq, well off
its early 2000 peak of $90, but Intuit's shares remain up 7% for the
year.</TE>
<TE>   Intuit figures the Internal Revenue Service's heavy promotion of
electronic filing will contribute to its growth. The company's tax
business generated $573 million in sales during its latest fiscal
year, a 26% increase from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Barring radical tax reforms, about half of the 36 million
taxpayers still filing their returns manually will turn to TurboTax
or other tax-filing programs such as H&amp;R Block Inc.'s TaxCut in the
next few years, predicted industry analyst Adam Holt of J.P. Morgan
H&amp;Q.</TE>
<TE>   The 19-year-old company is building on the popularity of its
TurboTax software with an online edition that is rapidly winning over
converts to electronic tax returns. In the last year, 2.1 million
customers--an 80% increase from the previous year--paid fees of as
much as $39.95 to file their taxes over the Web.</TE>
<TE>   Intuit attracted the online growth without cannibalizing the sales
of its desktop version of TurboTax, of which the firm sold 5.5
million units, up from 5.2 million the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   With tax trends working in its favor, Intuit is devoting more
attention to the $18-billion market for small-business software--a
segment also being eyed by Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft last year paid $1.1 billion to buy small-business
specialist Great Plains Software, and Oracle has been selling an
online service aimed at small businesses since last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Neither of the software giants, however, have made significant
inroads into Intuit's small-business specialties. Bennett hopes to
keep them at bay by building on the popularity of Intuit's QuickBooks
products.</TE>
<TE>   Intuit recently introduced a more sophisticated version of
QuickBooks, priced at $2,500 to $3,500, designed for small businesses
as their payrolls expand beyond 25 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett is counting on this next chapter in QuickBooks to retain
longtime customers such as Brett Wickard, who needed more advanced
software to help him run his Portland, Maine-based music store chain.</TE>
<TE>   With his Bull Moose Music chain expanding to 74 employees in nine
stores, Wickard reluctantly was considering switching to a Great
Plains product until Intuit showed him the expanded version of
QuickBooks. He happily upgraded.</TE>
<TE>   "We really didn't want to switch," Wickard said. "It would have
been a nightmare."</TE>
<TE>   If Intuit is able to sell the deluxe edition of QuickBooks to just
5% of its 275,000 small-business users with more than 25 workers, it
will generate $41 million in revenue, Holt said.</TE>
<TE>   Holt is bullish on Intuit, with a $57 price target on the stock.</TE>
<TE>   Intuit also is introducing more industry-specific products and
rolling out new services, such as payroll processing.</TE>
<TE>   Since last November, Intuit has bought OMware Inc., the Flagship
Group, CBS Employer Services Inc., Management Reports Inc., Eclipse
Inc. and Blue Ocean Software for a total of $490 million in cash and
stock. All are specialty software makers except CBS Employer, which
provides payroll services.</TE>
<TE>   "These are not fixer-uppers," Bennett said. "These are already
strong businesses that we are turbocharging with our brand. We want
to become ubiquitous."</TE>

<HD>Tech Firms May Disclose More Options Data</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Intel and others that resist treating stock
perks as expenses are weighing measures to appease regulators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUI-YONG YU</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Intel Corp. and other companies in the computer industry that have
resisted treating stock options as an expense are considering
disclosing more details about how their options grants affect
earnings.</LD>
<LD>   Intel has made a proposal to Silicon Valley lobbying group TechNet
that computer companies create a quarterly "equity impact sheet" that
will reveal the number of options grants, the timetable for exercise
and the potential effect on earnings, said Rick White, president and
chief executive of the organization.</LD>
<LD>   Computer, software and Internet-related companies are devising
alternatives aimed at staving off treating options as a cost. They
contend it would slash profit and hurt recruiting. Their effort comes
as companies are moving to account for options as an expense under
pressure from investors, lawmakers and regulators who say excluding
such grants as a cost allows companies to inflate profit.</LD>
<TE>   "We recognize there has been some abuse of stock options at the
senior level, and our main focus is to preserve stock options for
rank-and-file employees," said White, whose organization has formed a
working group on stock options. Palo Alto-based TechNet has about 250
company members, including Cisco Systems Inc., Oracle Corp. and
Microsoft Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Intel spokesman Bill Calder said the company "is involved in the
overall lobbying campaign, of which TechNet is a part." He said he
wasn't aware of the company's participation in preparing alternative
disclosure methods.</TE>
<TE>   Other ideas being considered include requiring executives to hold
options for five years before exercising them and restrictions on
their ability to sell stock, White said. None of the proposals call
for accounting for options as an expense.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want a system where the senior guys have an incentive
to pump the stock, sell their own options and leave everyone else
holding the bag," White said. "We will be proposing a plan that makes
it clear you can't manipulate your company's stock, make a short-term
profit and hit the road."</TE>
<TE>   This month, Intel said it wouldn't include options as a cost in
income statements. The chip maker's 2001 net income of $1.29 billion
would have shrunk to $254 million if options were treated as an
expense, the company said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   As of June, Intel's five highest-paid officers held 2.3% of the
company's 750 million options outstanding, Intel said in an SEC
filing. Chief Executive Craig Barrett was paid $1.68 million in
salary and bonus and was awarded 484,696 stock options in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   As Silicon Valley firms consider ways to increase disclosure, many
U.S. companies are accounting for options as an expense to restore
investor confidence shattered by abuses at Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc.
and other companies. More than 70 companies in the last two months
have made the change, including Coca-Cola Co., Computer Associates
International Inc., Washington Post Co., Freddie Mac, Wachovia Corp.
and General Motors Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Many companies in the computer industry that rely on stock options
to pay employees have fought attempts to count stock options as an
operating expense. They say such a move would distort earnings and
lead to options being concentrated among senior executives.</TE>
<TE>   TechNet--founded in 1997 by former Netscape Communications Corp.
CEO Jim Barksdale, Cisco CEO John Chambers and John Doerr, a partner
in venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers--has lobbied
lawmakers on that position. In July, the Senate blocked two
amendments that could have required companies to deduct the estimated
cost of options from their reported profits.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of expensing options say it would force companies to
recognize costs they may never incur if options aren't exercised,
thereby understating earnings. This group, which includes Princeton
University professor Burton Malkiel, agrees with Silicon Valley that
there is no precise way to measure the compensation cost associated
with options.</TE>
<TE>   The use of stock options "does not result in any reduction in the
overall size of the firm's total earnings pie--it only affects the
way in which that pie is sliced and divided up," wrote Malkiel in an
editorial in the Wall Street Journal in April. "This is markedly
different from the effect of, say, a rise in wages that results in a
net reduction in the firm's cash."</TE>
<TE>   Companies that resist expensing options may suffer declines in
their stock prices and lose credibility with investors, said Nell
Minow, editor of the Corporate Library, a Web site that reports on
corporate governance, including executive compensation and board
performance.</TE>
<TE>   "In this era of uncertainty of financial reporting, money is going
to flow to the companies that create the greatest credibility with
the way they issue their numbers," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Billionaire investor Warren Buffett and other proponents of
expensing say companies inflate their reported profits by excluding
the cost of options. Some advocates also say the method of including
estimated option costs in a footnote to annual financial statements
encourages executives to manipulate earnings to boost the stock
price.</TE>
<TE>   TechNet's White said it may take a year before a new standard for
expensing options is adopted in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "As people try to implement expensing of stock options, I think
there's going to be quite a bit of rethinking about the whole thing
because it's so difficult to value them," he said. "There's going to
be several more months of turmoil as people figure out what makes
sense."</TE>
<TE>   Companies will be forced to make some additional disclosures next
year.</TE>
<TE>   The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets U.S.
bookkeeping rules, in 2003 will require U.S. companies to disclose an
estimate of stock-option costs in footnotes to financial statements
quarterly instead of annually.</TE>
<TE>   IBM Corp., the world's biggest computer maker, has said it wants
more debate on how to value options before deciding whether to report
them as a cost.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft, the world's biggest software maker, has said it will
stick to the present method of reporting options in its footnotes.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has said he disagrees with the view of
some other computer-industry executives that the consequence of
treating options as an expense would be "very, very gloomy."</TE>

<HD>New SEC to Tackle Corporate Reform</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Corporate governance and accounting reform in America will be on the
front burner Tuesday, as new faces at the Securities and Exchange
Commission and Chairman Harvey L. Pitt begin implementing the
landmark Sarbanes-Oxley Act to clean up big business.</LD>
<LD>   The most far-reaching remake of U.S. securities laws since the
1930s, the legislation calls for many changes during the next year,
including regular certification by top corporate officers of
financial results and faster disclosure of corporate insider trading.</LD>
<LD>   Both these sections of Sarbanes-Oxley will be considered Tuesday
at the SEC's first public meeting with three new members: Harvey
Goldschmid, Paul Atkins and Roel Campos.</LD>
<TE>   As a series of corporate scandals ranging from Enron Corp. to
WorldCom Inc. shook U.S. markets over the last 12 months, Pitt, a
former Wall Street lawyer, spent most of his first year in office
coping virtually alone with the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   After winning praise for helping restore the stock markets after
the Sept. 11 attacks, Pitt took heavy fire for his handling of
relations with past clients, leading some lawmakers from both sides
of the aisle in Congress to call for his resignation.</TE>
<TE>   The new commissioners will give Pitt needed political cover,
lawyers said, and help share the load as the SEC hammers out the
details of reforms drafted by Democratic Maryland Sen. Paul Sarbanes
and Republican Ohio Rep. Michael Oxley, and signed into law by
President Bush on July 30.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans Pitt and Cynthia Glassman, an economist who came
aboard this summer, will be joined by Atkins, another Republican
lawyer, as well as two Democrats--law school professor Goldschmid and
broadcasting executive Campos.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC is under siege by corporate lobbyists trying to influence
how it implements the quickly approved Sarbanes-Oxley legislation.
Some lawyers estimated the SEC in the next year must adopt 24 new
sets of rules.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the commission must square the demands of more than
1,300 foreign companies that are listed on U.S. exchanges with a
provision requiring chief executives and chief financial officers to
swear by their firms' financial results.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven German companies--including auto maker DaimlerChrysler and
telecommunications group Deutsche Telekom--have demanded that
non-U.S. companies be exempt from results certification. The British

<HD>Canadian Auto Workers Authorize Strike</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Canadian auto workers have overwhelmingly given their union the
go-ahead to call a strike at the Big Three auto makers, as contract
talks that could affect the entire North American car industry head
down to the wire.</LD>
<LD>   The Canadian Autoworkers Union, which represents about 46,000
workers with the Big Three auto makers, said 97% of union members at
General Motors Corp. of Canada gave the union the mandate to call a
strike, while the numbers were 95% at Ford Motor Co. of Canada and
97% at DaimlerChrysler.</LD>
<LD>   That does not mean that car workers will strike, but it gives the
union the right to call a strike if talks break down.</LD>
<TE>   Contract negotiations kicked off July 16 at the Big Three auto
makers, but they are just ramping up before existing contracts expire
Sept. 17.</TE>
<TE>   While the vote was widely considered a formality, CAW President
Buzz Hargrove said the high percentages in favor of the proposal were
important for the union.</TE>
<TE>   "If we got low strike votes, that would be a message that the
companies might read as a weakness on the part of the union," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hargrove will announce a strike deadline and say which company
will be targeted for discussions after Labor Day weekend. The deal
signed with the target company will then set the tone for
negotiations with the other auto makers.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time that the union has held contract talks at a
different time from its United Auto Workers counterpart in the United
States, where contracts do not expire for another year, and that
means U.S. investors are watching the outcome of the talks closely.</TE>
<TE>   Only the 1993 and 1999 contract negotiations have been settled
without strike action.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Economic reports this week could boost stocks if they suggest the
nation's recovery is still on track. Investors will scrutinize data
on new-home sales, durable goods orders and consumer confidence.</LD>
<LD>   New and existing home sales data for July are expected today,
while durable goods orders are expected Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Durable goods orders, forecast to have risen 1.2% in July, are
important to Wall Street because they can indicate the strength of
business investments.</LD>
<TE>   Also on the calendar Tuesday is consumer confidence data for
August, which are expected to dip to 97.0 from a revised 97.1 the
previous month.</TE>
<TE>   And coming Friday is the University of Michigan's final consumer
sentiment index, which is expected to be 88 in August, about the same
as August's 88.1. Both gauges of consumer optimism declined in June
and July.</TE>
<TE>   A report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday may show that
orders for durable goods rose 1.4% in July after a 4.1% drop in June.</TE>
<TE>   A report coming Friday is expected to show that personal spending
probably rose 0.8% in July, the largest gain in five months.</TE>
<TE>   Incomes probably rose 0.3% after rising 0.6% in June, the Commerce
Department is expected to report.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think the economy is going to improve, although we may have
a [stock] pullback because we always do after substantial rallies,"
said Benjamin Pace, who helps oversee $9 billion for Deutsche Bank
Private Banking.</TE>
<TE>   But a report Thursday on gross domestic product might reinforce
the sluggishness of the recovery so far.</TE>
<TE>   The revised estimate for the second-quarter's growth rate of 1.1%
that is expected would be the same as previously reported and reflect
a widening trade deficit and slowing growth in consumer spending.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Job Market Looks Bleak to Year's End</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans looking for work won't see an increase in the number of job
openings through the year's end as companies remain cautious about
the economy's recovery, a survey released today will show.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-four percent of the companies surveyed expected to hire
more people in the fourth quarter, while 9% plan to cut workers,
according to Manpower Inc.'s quarterly survey of 16,000 businesses.</LD>
<LD>   The rest of the companies said they either expect to maintain
their staffing levels or were uncertain about hiring activity in the
fourth quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Those numbers compare with 27% that expected to add more jobs and
8% that planned cuts in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   When seasonally adjusted, the fourth-quarter's employment
prospects remain stable.</TE>
<TE>   "For the balance of the year, job seekers are still going to be
challenged," said Jeffrey Joerres, chairman and chief executive of
Glendale-based Manpower, the nation's biggest staffing company, which
has conducted the survey for 26 years.</TE>
<TE>   Past surveys have showed hiring prospects often plateau during an
economic recovery, Joerres said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still cautiousness within the companies," he said. "Given
the economy continues to improve, albeit slowly, you'll see a bit of
an acceleration after the pause."</TE>
<TE>   Employment levels will hold steady nationwide except in the West,
which expects a slight decrease in hiring from the third quarter
largely because the region is home to many struggling technology and
telecommunications companies, Joerres said.</TE>
<TE>   The finance, insurance and real estate sector is the only one
surveyed that anticipates improved hiring compared with last quarter
and a year ago, the survey found.</TE>
<TE>   The manufacturing sector, hit hard by the recession, expects to
maintain a consistent hiring level, which is a significant
improvement over a year ago, Joerres said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Verizon Communications Inc., the biggest U.S. local-telephone
company, expects customers to cancel 3 million phone lines this year
through 2004 to switch to wireless, cable and Internet services.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Ivan Seidenberg and his deputies made the forecast
in an Aug. 15 presentation to Federal Communications Commission
officials, according to information posted on the FCC's Web site.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based company had 60.4 million phone lines in service
as of June, down 3.3% from a year earlier. The forecast would
represent a widening from 800,000 lines lost last year, Verizon
spokesman Bob Varettoni said.</LD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of songwriters and music publishers objected to Bertelsmann's
planned purchase through Bankruptcy Court of the assets of
song-swapping service Napster Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The filing by Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller and others sets up a
fight at a hearing scheduled for Thursday in federal Bankruptcy Court
in Delaware over whether the Bertelsmann deal should go through.
Bertelsmann is offering $9 million in cash for creditors on top of
more than $85 million in previous loans.</LD>
<LD>   The songwriters wrote that they are objecting to the transaction
"based primarily on Bertelsmann's domination and control of
[Napster], its inequitable and collusive conduct and [Napster's]
unlawful actions."</LD>
<TE>   "We don't want the $85 million to be counted," said an attorney
for the writers, Aidan Synnott. "The $85 million has chilled the
bidding process. There has to be a do-over of the bidding."</TE>
<TE>   Napster's creditors failed last week to get other bidders to step
forward and offer at least $25 million.</TE>
<TE>   A Napster representative predicted the bankruptcy judge will
approve the Bertelsmann sale, since it would bring in some new money
for creditors.</TE>

<LD>PeoplePC Inc., a San Francisco-based computer seller, agreed to pay
$100,000 in penalties to settle Federal Trade Commission claims that
it didn't tell customers their deliveries would be delayed and didn't
provide copies of warranties.</LD>
<LD>   The company, a unit of Internet service provider EarthLink Inc.,
didn't notify customers in advance when it would be unable to deliver
merchandise within two to three weeks, as promised, the FTC said.
PeoplePC sells its computers through a Web site and by telephone.</LD>
<LD>   "The final settlement is what we expected," EarthLink spokesman
Dan Greenfield said.</LD>
<TE>   The FTC said PeoplePC didn't tell customers they could receive
free copies of warranties. The company also didn't tell customers
they could cancel their orders because of delays in shipping,
according to the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   The company agreed to comply with FTC rules in the future, the
commission said. The settlement did not amount to an admission by
PeoplePC of any violation of law, the FTC said.</TE>

<LD>He's short. He's fat. He's not a snappy dresser, and he spends his
day fantasizing about princesses. He's also responsible for billions
of dollars in global sales since the mid-1980s.</LD>
<LD>   He is, of course, Mario the Plumber, star of stage, screen and the
most successful video game franchise in history. Today he returns to
stores in his first original console game in six years, "Super Mario
Sunshine" for the GameCube.</LD>
<LD>   The little man with the mustache and the red overalls has been the
backbone of his corporate master, Japan's Nintendo Co., since 1985's
"Super Mario Bros.," which was his first starring role. .</LD>
<TE>   "There's a lot of memories and a lot of nostalgia tied to Mario,"
said Mark MacDonald, executive editor of Electronic Gaming Monthly, a
leading industry magazine.</TE>
<TE>   The GameCube player made its debut last November with "Luigi's
Mansion," a game based on Mario's brother that has done relatively
well at retail.</TE>
<TE>   Decent sales aside, though, it was little comfort to rabid fans
who have been shaking in withdrawal as they waited for "Sunshine" to
hit retail shelves and provide the fix they've dreamed of since
1996's "Super Mario 64."</TE>

<LD>Paul Masson used to say he'd sell no wine before its time.</LD>
<LD>   Somebody should've given this advice to the makers of the first
cell phone-organizer to incorporate Microsoft Corp.'s Pocket PC 2002
Phone Edition.</LD>
<LD>   Like a burgundy opened before its rough edges have mellowed, this
handset is too young for store shelves.</LD>
<TE>   Too bad, because the T-Mobile Pocket PC phone--offered in the
United States by VoiceStream Wireless--is a great idea.</TE>
<TE>   With the kinks worked out, I'm sure it'll make a fine, albeit
expensive, choice for people like me who'd prefer to combine cell
phone with personal organizer.</TE>
<TE>   The $500 device contains the same features as the hand-held
computers from Compaq or Toshiba, such as Microsoft's Outlook
personal organizer and e-mail software, along with other offerings
including MSN Messenger, Windows Media Player, Word and Excel.</TE>
<TE>   But the gadget also sports a stubby antenna poking out of one end,
used by the cell phone, which integrates with Outlook's contacts
database.</TE>
<TE>   That means that if you sync the device with your PC, not only do
you get all your contacts' phone numbers and e-mail addresses, but
you also can use the device to call or send e-mail without having to
punch keys on the color touch screen.</TE>
<TE>   A few other "communicators" or "smart phones" already have
emerged, the best-known being Handspring Inc.'s Treo, which runs the
Palm operating system. Nokia, Audiovox Corp. and Kyocera Corp. also
sell such devices.</TE>
<TE>   The T-Mobile (named after the wireless brand of VoiceStream's
German parent Deutsche Telekom) is the first to hit the market that
incorporates Microsoft's Pocket PC Phone Edition operating system.
The Thera, from Audiovox, uses a Pocket PC version not specifically
designed for wireless communicators.</TE>
<TE>   On the T-Mobile hand-held, the Internet Explorer browser that
languishes unused on most Pocket PC devices comes into its own.</TE>
<TE>   I sat on my deck and surfed the BBC's Web site--the faster-loading
text-only version--and was surprised at how quickly the stories
popped up.</TE>
<TE>   The phone also has SMS, or Short Message Service, which has been
the rage in Europe for more than a year and is slowly catching on in
the United States. It lets you fire off short messages to similarly
equipped cell phones, even providing popular mobile phone one-liners
such as "Where are you?"</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for T-Mobile and Microsoft, the device failed to do
these tasks about as often as it completed them.</TE>
<TE>   The phone uses VoiceStream's GSM service, which in New York,
anyway, suffers from reliability problems. The browser relies on
VoiceStream's higher-speed GPRS network, theoretically able to
download Web pages at a speed comparable to a home dial-up
connection.</TE>
<TE>   For me, only the BBC site operated smoothly. My connections to
Yahoo, Hotmail, Salon.com and Amazon.com proved frustratingly slow.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, it appears Microsoft hasn't gotten the phone functions
fully integrated with its Pocket PC software.</TE>
<TE>   After a few days of testing, Outlook's contacts database stopped
working, blocking me from making calls or sending e-mail unless I
could remember the number.</TE>
<TE>   With so many features bundled into a gadget the size of a
cigarette pack, I'm sure it's an enormous task to get them all
working in harmony. And the problems with the cellular and wireless
connectivity can't really be blamed on the device.</TE>
<TE>   Still, I suspect many early buyers of the T-Mobile smart phone
will treat it like a bottle of under-aged wine. They'll send it back.</TE>

<HD>Market Seen for Ads on Demand</HD>
<DH>Media: The increasing use of humor has led TV viewers to
seek out 'adver-tainment.' Some Web sites are devoted solely to
commercials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM PASICK</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Evading commercials is a way of life for most television
watchers--isn't that what the remote control is for? But a new crop
of Web sites is proof that people will go out of their way to watch
creative, humorous ads.</LD>
<LD>   The idea that advertising can be entertaining has been helped by
the willingness of high-profile Hollywood directors such as the Coen
brothers and Spike Lee to make commercials. Some 30-second ads are
more short-form art than hard sell.</LD>
<LD>   The development of "adver-tainment" could become especially
important to marketers as more consumers get access to technology
such as that by TiVo Inc. that lets them skip over boring ads. That
will challenge the ad business to create ads that consumers really
want to see.</LD>
<TE>   "That's the future--advertising on demand," said Jack Myers,
editor in chief of the media newsletter Jack Myers Report.</TE>
<TE>   With high-speed Internet access becoming more pervasive, the Web
is becoming the main focus of advertising on demand. Companies are
increasingly advertising their products on their own sites.</TE>
<TE>   Two sites have been set up that aim to put all major advertisers'
commercial spots in one place on the Web. These are Ads.com
(www.ads.com) and AdCritic.com (www.adcritic.com), which offer a
dizzying array of 30-second spots, encompassing virtually every ad
shown on television.</TE>
<TE>   Neither site would disclose its traffic, but both said viewership
is growing rapidly.</TE>
<TE>   Ads.com doesn't charge users who visit the site. The site's
developers, whose financial backing includes the venture capital arm
of media conglomerate News Corp., hope to turn a profit by selling
links to advertisers and pooling consumer data.</TE>
<TE>   They already have secured access to ads from scores of advertisers
and spent years securing the legal clearance from the Screen Actors
Guild, which manages royalties for performers.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a bunch of things consumers want to find on the Web
when an ad has caught their interest--if they missed the 800 number
or couldn't read the fine print or wanted to know what the music
was," said Ads.com President and Chief Executive John Atcheson.</TE>
<TE>   The newly relaunched AdCritic.com is a $69-a-year site. Although
it is aimed at advertising professionals, anyone can subscribe. The
original free incarnation of the site, though wildly popular, drowned
in red ink because of the cost of streaming video to millions of
viewers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the bandwidth--the more people who come to the site to view
ads, the more you, the site owner, pay," said David Klein, editorial
and publishing director for the Ad Age Group. Ad Age, a unit of
privately held publisher Crain Communications Inc., bought the
AdCritic site from founder Peter Beckman.</TE>
<TE>   Both sites offer a slew of ads from traditional viewer favorites
such as Anheuser-Busch Cos., Volkswagen and Gap Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the popularity of such ads, some advertising experts
question whether an entertaining commercial is necessarily an
effective one, even if viewers go out of their way to watch it.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not looking for dishwashing liquid or paper towel [ads],"
said Klein of Ad Age. "People are looking for funny ads--Volkswagen,
Nike, Budweiser."</TE>
<TE>   If consumers can evade boring commercials with ease--and some
products are not well-suited to ads that are entertaining--the ad
world could be turned on its head, industry watchers said. Some of
the funds that go to TV could be redirected to marketing outlets such
as sporting event sponsorships and in-store promotions.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two categories of ads consumers like: the ones that run
year after year and the ads that are incredibly entertaining in the
moment and are quickly forgotten," said Mark DiMassimo of DiMassimo
Brand Advertising. "It is not enough, nearly, to be entertaining. If
it was, this business would be so easy."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Reading "Putting a Price on Sept. 11's Human Loss" (Aug. 21) left me
outraged. It describes recent lawsuits of families of victims of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and says Michael James "stands to receive
more than $1 million." Families of victims have my utmost sympathy
for the tragedy that struck them on that day. In no way do I believe
that the deaths of their loved ones are the least bit
inconsequential. I also understand that sudden loss of a family
member who leaves behind dependents and perhaps unpaid bills, as well
as loss of the care they provided, such as "cooking, cleaning [and]
bill paying" duties, is both an emotional and financial shock. But
realize that James has already received $1,200 every two weeks from
New York state as compensation that, if received for a year, would
total more than his wife's yearly income of $30,000--not to mention
the weekly checks of $750 from workers' compensation, all of which
would be shared among (tragically) one less person than before her
death.</LD>
<TE>   Congress has opened the floodgates for the remaining 3,000
victims' families to receive, as stated, sums totaling between $4
billion and $7 billion. And how can one person's life, no matter how
successful, be worth one penny more than another's? Everybody get in
line. Tomorrow we're beginning a class-action suit for our relatives
who have died as victims of diseases the government has not funded
enough money to find cures for. Capitol Hill should wake up before
the citizens of this country have sued the roads out from under us.</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Herczog</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The logic of Richard Mosk's well-reasoned Aug. 18 commentary, "A
Crazy Quilt of Victim Compensation," denouncing large government
awards to selected families of victims of terrorism, is unassailable.
But why not go a few steps further? Why should these families, more
than anyone else who has lost a relative through a wrongful act,
receive government compensation? Moreover, why should anyone be
"compensated" monetarily for the pain of such loss? Will $1 million
make someone feel better about the loss of a husband or parent?
Should it?</TE>

<LD>Richard Greene makes some very fine points in "Go Ahead, Strike--but
Foot the Bill" (Commentary, Aug. 21). However, what all these players
and owners need is a taste of their own medicine. If all the fans had
an ounce of discipline and courage, not to mention a willingness to
set a good example for their children, they would completely boycott
all major league baseball games for an entire season. They could even
form boycott clubs and do alternative activities.</LD>
<LD>   The only reason these millionaire players and billionaire owners
make money and prostitute the game is because the fans pay for it and
keep going back. Therefore, fans and columnists shouldn't complain,
because they are the ones who accept and contribute to the problem.
If there are no fans watching or going to games, there will be no
baseball. Strikes, excessive salaries and rising ticket costs will
stop only when the fans take control and close their wallets and
change the channel. Until then, shut up and take it.</LD>

<LD>In his Aug. 21 commentary, "U.S.-Saudi Rift Rewards Terrorists,"
Hassan Yassin asserts that Osama bin Laden chose Saudis for 9/11 to
create a Saudi-U.S. rift--and ignores the obvious, that he chose them
for the same reason that NBA coaches select blacks for their
basketball teams. They were his best source. He claims the friendship
of many Saudis but discards the fact that their Arabic publications
are full of anti-U.S. vitriol. And he is oblivious to what 9/11
families are claiming: that Saudi Arabia is a principal source and
conduit of funding for terrorism. Yes, aided by the Saudis, the
U.S.-Saudi rift rewards terrorists.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As many others, I have read numerous articles, essays and
diatribes about the aftereffects of Sept. 11, but none has moved me
as much as Yassin's words. He speaks for so many of us who hold out
hope that even through our national and international tragedy, the
actions of a few will not destroy our hard-won personal and
governmental friendships. Only when we, as a global family of
nations, can look beyond outward appearances and religious
differences and appreciate the value within will we overcome those
who would seek to annihilate us all.</TE>
<TE>   B.R. Montgomery</TE>
<TE>   Playa del Rey</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How's that again? Could it be that it is U.S.-Saudi relations that
reward terrorism? Are there not militant Muslims born in Saudi Arabia
who support and spread terrorism in the Middle East and throughout
the world? How many Saudis became martyrs on 9/11, likely the worst
terrorist experience visited on the United States? On terrorism, the
Saudis are experts. Take away oil. What then would be the basis for
U.S.-Saudi friendship? Really, any?</TE>

<LD>Why do smokers feel that it is acceptable to leave their stubbed-out
cigarette butts on the street? Our streets are swept clean by rain
that flows into storm drains and then out to the Pacific Ocean.
Cigarette butts make up the majority of this trash. Why not use a
trash can or maybe that clever little device that comes standard in
most cars--the ashtray? I am appalled by the flagrant littering and
subsequent environmental damage smokers inflict on this Earth on a
daily basis. I see no reason why the rest of us should be forced to
clean up after these lazy litterbugs. Smokers, please, limit the harm
cigarettes cause to your own bodies, and don't let one bad habit lead
to another.</LD>

Forest-Thinning Plan," Aug. 22). Isn't that like shooting someone in
the heart to prevent a heart attack? My husband is a firefighter. He
and his colleagues are capable of putting out fires if they need to.
They don't need people chopping down trees to prevent forest fires
any more than they need people chopping down houses to prevent house
fires. They just need people to show some common sense. With this
current administration, that's what we all need.</LD>

<TE>   At every opportunity the Bush administration has rolled back
environmental protections in favor of big business. The president's
forest-thinning program is more of the same. Brush and small trees in
the forest do need to be cleared, especially in areas where human
life and property may be threatened. But the only reason to allow the
cutting of fire-resistant old growth is to open the door to runaway
logging in areas now protected.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's and Interior Secretary Gale Norton's degradation of
long-agreed-on environmental rules can't possibly be what the
majority of voters wanted when he was selected president and probably
offends many who voted for him as well. There are plenty of reasons
to choose from, but the Republican assault on the environment should
be reason enough for voters to oppose his shortsighted policies.</TE>

<LD>On Aug. 6, I went to our capital as a representative of more than
43,000 California residents who would be affected by a bill being
presented to the state Senate Judiciary Committee. I waited over six
hours until the bill was heard, and in the middle of my testimony the
chairwoman of the committee, Sen. Martha M. Escutia (D-Whittier),
walked out. Aside from being disrespectful to me, she showed contempt
for California residents.</LD>
<LD>   To compound the situation, on a committee of seven, only two
senators were present to hear the testimony, and two voted without
hearing it. So why does the Legislature conduct public hearings,
creating cost and wasted time for those who wish to be heard? Do our
elected officials believe they are beyond the influence of the
electorate, or is it that they just don't care? Wait until next
election.</LD>

<HD>Mideast Influence in Congressional Primaries</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I have often wondered how the Jewish lobby could be so powerful (Aug.
21). The answer may be seen in this year's primaries where, last week
in Georgia, Denise Majette, supported by Jewish and pro-Israeli
groups, defeated Democratic Rep. Cynthia A. McKinney. Earlier this
year, in Alabama, it was reported that Artur Davis defeated
Democratic Rep. Earl Hilliard for the same reason.</LD>
<LD>   Both McKinney and Hilliard sought a just peace for the Palestinian
territories, and both were defeated by the pro-Israeli constituency.
One wonders what sort of peace the pro-Israeli constituency wants, or
for that matter, the Jewish lobby. One also wonders how a Congress
composed of people like this can contribute to world peace. And then
we ask why the world has become so unsafe.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Mideast Goes to Georgia," editorial, Aug. 22: I don't
understand why you think that the Middle East is not an appropriate
discussion for a congressional race. When a voter is reviewing
candidates for a political office, the voter has the responsibility
to look at all the issues on which a person will vote. Since the
Constitution gives the House of Representatives the exclusive right
to initiate all appropriations bills (which includes aid to Israel
and Egypt), the voter needs to know about each candidate's view in
this matter.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Gorman</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rep. McKinney was defeated for reelection and received only 42% of
the vote because her constituents were dissatisfied with her
representation of them in Congress. Her incompetence, intolerance and
propaganda were the deciding factors in this election. By suggesting
that pro-Israel supporters were responsible for her defeat, The Times
condescendingly assumes that the voters were manipulated and
incapable of assessing McKinney's poor performance.</TE>
<TE>   Peter J. Cohen</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your editorial highlights the unfortunate dilemma that many voters
face in trying to influence U.S. Mideast policy: how to induce change
when most lawmakers are tripping over themselves trying to
demonstrate their support for Israel. Even longtime champions of
human rights like our own Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Reps. Nancy
Pelosi and Tom Lantos are suddenly mute when it comes to speaking out
about Palestinians subjected to 35 years of Israeli military
occupation. Regrettably, the Israeli lobby today is so powerful that
it can command audiences of half the Senate and a third of the House
at its annual dinners and marshal overwhelming resolutions through
Congress endorsing positions described by one congressman as being
"to the right of Ariel Sharon and the Likud Party."</TE>
<TE>   Unless voters muster enough interest to protest this hijacking of
U.S. foreign policy, it is likely that most lawmakers will continue
acting in their own political interest at the expense of a rational
Mideast policy. It will probably take the defeat of the most ardent
supporters of Israel to convince Congress that it's OK to defy the
Israeli lobby. Until then, Palestinians and Israelis will continue to
suffer the consequences of dead-end policies dictated by the Israeli
right, and America's security and prestige will remain under threat.</TE>

<HD>Ted Ashley, 80; Talent Agent Also Ran Warner Bros. Studio</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ted Ashley, talent agent turned movie mogul who reversed the sagging
fortunes of Warner Bros. in the 1970s with such blockbuster motion
pictures as "A Clockwork Orange," "Dirty Harry" and "The Exorcist,"
has died. He was 80.</LD>
<LD>   Ashley died Saturday of natural causes at New York Hospital in
Manhattan, a spokesman for New York's Frank Campbell Funeral Home
said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Brooklyn-born Ashley had no experience running a movie studio
when he was tapped to head Warner Bros. in 1969. But he had a strong
background in show business as a talent agent with William Morris and
later his Ashley Famous Agency.</LD>
<TE>   Over the next 11 years, he not only proved successful in the new
job but placed an indelible stamp on Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   By 1972, he was voted motion picture showman of the year by the
Publicists Guild of America; in 1973, he was named Pioneer of the
Year by the Foundation of Motion Picture Pioneers.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, he was the subject of a New Yorker magazine profile
titled, "Who Is Ted Ashley? Just the King of Hollywood, Baby."</TE>
<TE>   The son of a tailor, Ashley studied accounting at the former City
College of New York and started his career as a teenage office boy at
William Morris. After several years as a successful William Morris
agent, he acquired his own agency, and developed Ashley Famous into a
major packager of television shows, including "The Carol Burnett
Show," "The Doris Day Show" and "Mission: Impossible." His clients
included Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Perry Como, Burt
Lancaster, Rex Harrison and Ingrid Bergman.</TE>
<TE>   When his agency was sold in 1967 to Kinney Services Inc., Ashley
stayed on. Two years later, when Kinney bought Warner Bros. and
changed its name to Warner Communications Inc., it had to sell the
talent agency to avoid conflict of interest but tapped Ashley to
rescue the studio.</TE>
<TE>   Within six weeks, Ashley had fired or retired 17 of 21 executives
and begun to rebuild Warner Bros. into a Hollywood powerhouse. He
brought in top directors and actors, including Stanley Kubrick, Peter
Bogdanovich, Clint Eastwood and Barbra Streisand.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley, as a hands-on leader who constantly read scripts and books
that might be turned into movies, made the studio commercially
successful with such films as "What's Up, Doc?" "Blazing Saddles,"
"Mame," "Dog Day Afternoon," "All the President's Men," "The Outlaw
Josey Wales," "The Goodbye Girl," "Summer of '42," the "Superman"
series and "Death in Venice."</TE>
<TE>   Already adept in small-screen fare, Ashley also helped Warner
Bros. become prominent in the new television miniseries genre. He
brought in David L. Wolper, who produced "Roots," "The Thorn Birds"
and "North &amp; South."</TE>
<TE>   Although Ashley stepped down to catch his breath a couple of
times, he served as Warner Bros. chairman from 1969 to 1980, then
became a consultant, and in 1982 became vice chairman and member of
the board of the parent Warner Communications Inc. He retired in
1988.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley is survived by his wife, Page Cuddy Ashley; four daughters
from a former marriage, Fran Curtis Dubin, Diane Ashley, Kim Balin
and Ba-nhi Sinclair; a brother, Alfred; and two grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Services are scheduled Tuesday in New York. The family has asked
that any memorial donations be made to the New York-based I Have a
Dream Foundation for the Ashley Project NYC Fund.</TE>

<HD>Peter R. Hunt, 77; Editor of Early Bond Films Amped Up the
Action</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter R. Hunt, editor of the first five James Bond films and director
of the singular "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" starring George
Lazenby as the suave spy, has died. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   Hunt died Aug. 14 of heart failure at his home in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   The London-born Hunt, who studied violin at the London College of
Music and art history at the University of Rome before joining the
British film industry in 1947, was a highly respected film editor for
nearly two decades before he turned to directing.</LD>
<TE>   From the get-go of the Bond franchise, "Dr. No" in 1962, Hunt
developed a fresh action editing style he called "crash cutting." By
scissoring out dull footage such as the hero walking down stairs, he
created faster pacing and added edge-of-the-seat suspense. The form
is now ubiquitous in action filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   Hunt perfected the quick-cutting technique as he went on to edit
the next four Bond films, all starring the original "Dr. No" hero,
Sean Connery--"From Russia with Love," "Goldfinger," "Thunderball"
and "You Only Live Twice."</TE>
<TE>   "My feeling was always that one should make the films seriously,"
Hunt once said of the Bond franchise, "but never take them
seriously."</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, Hunt was given his first chance to direct--the sixth Bond
film, which film historian Leonard Maltin notes in his "2002 Movie &amp;
Video Guide," "some 007 fans consider the best of the series."</TE>
<TE>   The film differed from its predecessors in many ways--a new Bond
in Lazenby, and one with real emotions who got married, although the
wife got killed in the finale. Hunt insisted on a top-notch actress
for the beautiful Bond girl, and got her--Dame Diana Rigg, then as
popular for her Emma Peel of television's "The Avengers" as for her
Shakespearean stage roles.</TE>
<TE>   " 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' is by a long shot the very
best of the James Bond epics," former Times entertainment editor
Charles Champlin began his review of the film. "It is ... ablaze with
action all the way. But it is also the first of the films in which
Bond is allowed any genuine claims to humanity, real feeling and
sentiment."</TE>
<TE>   Champlin praised Hunt's directing, writing: "It is a first Bond
effort for Peter Hunt as director, and he's turned the splendid trick
of creating impressions of depth without jeopardizing the gorgeous
escapist nonsense which the 007 enterprises are."</TE>
<TE>   Hunt also directed Roger Moore in several action productions,
although not as Bond. Among their collaborations were episodes of the
television series "The Persuaders" and the films "Gold" and "Shout at
the Devil" co-starring Lee Marvin. He directed Marvin and Charles
Bronson in "Death Hunt" and Bronson again in the 1987 political
thriller "Assassination." Other directing credits included
"Gulliver's Travels" and "Wild Geese II."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Hunt appeared in a number of documentaries and
special footage for DVD presentations of Bond films.</TE>
<TE>   Hunt, who served in the British military in World War II, is
survived by one son, Nicholas Kourtis-Hunt, of Santa Monica, and a
brother, Derek Hunt, of British Columbia.</TE>

<HD>They Won With Typical English Reserve</HD>

<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>English tourists beat their German rivals, 5-4, in a recent battle to
reserve deck chairs around a hotel pool at the Spanish resort of
Torremolinos, Germany's Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   With pictures documenting the peculiar rivalry long waged between
Britons and Germans at resorts in Europe, the paper awarded one point
per tourist.</LD>
<LD>   England led 2-0 by 7:28 a.m. before the first German chairs were
reserved, and they took a 5-3 lead by 8 a.m., when one bare-chested
Englishman put towels on 10 chairs. A German woman made it 5-4 by
reserving the seventh German chair at 8:15 a.m. By then, five Britons
had 32 chairs.</LD>
<TE>   Britons complain that Germans rise early to put towels on the best
chairs. Germans say when they arrive at the pool after breakfast
their towels have been moved.</TE>
<TE>   "Dear Englanders," Bild am Sonntag wrote. "We're happy to let you
win this one. But in soccer, it would have been a different story."</TE>

<HD>Central China Holds Its Breath</HD>
<DH>Asia: Flood crest crashes into a huge lake without bursting
its banks, but disaster is still possible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHANGSHA, China</DL>
<LD>The flood crest came and went. So far, giant Dongting Lake has held
steady against the mighty Yangtze, which crashed into it Sunday as
the river hurtled on its annual path of destruction.</LD>
<LD>   Yet no one dared to let his guard down as fresh rains began
pounding still perilously swollen waterways today.</LD>
<LD>   "This is no time to catch our breath," said He Liang, an official
at the anti-flood command center here in the capital of central Hunan
province, on Sunday. "Water levels remain above the danger zone.
Landslides and dike leaks continue."</LD>
<TE>   As he spoke, more than a million soldiers, peasants and rescue
workers were toiling to fortify embankments and fill holes along the
Dongting's 580-mile defensive shield. Water levels around China's
second-largest freshwater lake have reached near-historic highs this
summer as flooding around the country has claimed almost 1,000 lives.</TE>
<TE>   The deluge around the lake began to subside slightly Sunday,
suggesting that the region could be spared the calamity that befell
the country in 1998, leaving more than 4,000 people dead.</TE>
<TE>   But depending on how much water Mother Nature dumps on the area in
the next few days, the crisis may be far from over.</TE>
<TE>   "A little rain is OK, but a lot of rain could make things even
worse than 1998," He said.</TE>
<TE>   And even if Hunan, the birthplace of Mao Tse-tung and current
Premier Zhu Rongji, survives this year's scare, raging torrents will
probably find new victims downstream.</TE>
<TE>   Next stop for the Yangtze is the capital of Hubei province, Wuhan,
an industrial city of 7 million. Authorities there declared a state
of emergency over the weekend and braced for stormy weather expected
in the next few days. Farther out, traditionally vulnerable provinces
such as Anhui and Jiangxi were also racing to defend themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike in Europe, where recent floods represented a
once-in-a-century disaster, deluges are annual scourges in China.</TE>
<TE>   Officials are quick to point out how much work they have done
since the 1998 tragedy, which was caused by burst dikes and weak
banks. They credit better management of these fortifications and
various infrastructure improvements with keeping people relatively
safe this year.</TE>
<TE>   But critics remind them that the chronic floods are also man-made.
In the 1950s and '60s, the government encouraged peasants to fill up
parts of the Dongting and turn them into farms. Sediment buildup and
soil erosion from over-logging elevated water levels in the lake and
severely hampered its ability to act as a natural overflow basin for
the tempestuous Yangtze.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to undo its mistakes, Beijing has begun ordering
resettlement and a restoration of the original habitat around the
lake. But these are costly and time-consuming ventures.</TE>
<TE>   The state has also stepped up its efforts to erect the biggest and
most expensive hydroelectric project in the world. The controversial
Three Gorges Dam is billed as the ultimate solution to centuries of
floods that have ripped through the cradle of Chinese civilization.</TE>
<TE>   Critics charge that the dam's real mission is more electricity
generation than flood control. Also, the reservoir's colossal scale
and potential for sediment accumulation could make breaks and
spillovers unthinkable catastrophes.</TE>
<TE>   But Chinese officials have invested too much not to be confident
of success.</TE>
<TE>   When the Three Gorges project is finally finished, said Qiu
Shunling, a Yangtze River researcher in Hubei, "we won't see another
flood for at least a hundred years."</TE>

<HD>China Sets Regulations for Technology Exports</HD>
<DH>Trade: Sales related to making missiles will be restricted
in response to U.S. pressure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Bowing to a longtime U.S. demand, the Chinese government has issued
new rules to tighten its control over the export of missile
technology, state media reported Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The regulations, which went into effect Thursday, set up a
licensing and registration system for companies that want to sell
products or know-how that could be used to make missiles, the
official New China News Agency said.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement coincided with the arrival here of Deputy
Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage, who is paying a 48-hour visit
to pave the way for a summit in October between President Bush and
Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Arms control issues are expected to be
on the agenda of Armitage's talks in Beijing and of Jiang's visit to
Bush's ranch near Crawford, Texas.</LD>
<TE>   Washington has long complained that Chinese companies take
advantage of lax regulations--or even have government approval--to
sell missile-related items to countries such as Iran and North Korea,
two nations identified by Bush earlier this year as part of an "axis
of evil."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the White House said it would slap sanctions on nine
Chinese firms that it alleged had sold weapons technology to
countries in the Middle East. The move drew strong objections from
Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   The Communist regime promised in November 2000 to clamp down on
the transfer of sensitive equipment and technology and to publish a
list of exactly what kinds of items would be off-limits for export.</TE>
<TE>   But it has dragged its feet, in part because of the tense standoff
with Washington last year over an American spy plane that collided
with a Chinese fighter jet and crash-landed in southern China.
Relations between the two countries on military matters have been
testy since.</TE>
<TE>   Sino-American ties have improved somewhat since Beijing pledged to
cooperate in the battle against terrorism in the wake of last
September's attacks on the U.S. And on Sunday, White House Deputy
Press Secretary Scott McClellan called the Chinese announcement a
"positive step," adding, "We look forward to continuing to work with
China to address other nonproliferation issues."</TE>
<TE>   After his arrival in Beijing on Sunday, before the missile-export
rules were announced, Armitage said he would discuss a "full range of
issues" in his meetings with Chinese leaders today. He is scheduled
to leave for Japan on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The new regulations, signed by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, require
companies to clear their sales of weapons-related equipment with the
State Council, China's Cabinet, and with the Central Military
Commission. Scofflaws would be prosecuted, potentially on charges of
selling state secrets, a serious offense in China.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese government "stands against the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems," Foreign
Ministry spokesman Kong Quan said, according to the New China News
Agency.</TE>
<TE>   It is an open question how seriously China will enforce the new
rules. Assessing its performance will be a tough task for the Bush
administration, which will doubtless come under increasing pressure
from Beijing and American companies to respond to Sunday's move by
lifting a long-standing ban on the use of Chinese rockets for U.S.
commercial satellite launches.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the new regulations improve the prospects for a warmer
meeting between Jiang and Bush in October.</TE>
<TE>   When he goes to Texas, Jiang will still hold the three titles that
make him China's No. 1: president, general secretary of the Communist
Party and head of the Central Military Commission. Jiang's status as
China's top leader at the time of the October summit was guaranteed
by another announcement here Sunday that in effect set the date for a
crucial upcoming Communist Party conclave.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese state television said the Communist Party's 16th party
congress is expected to open Nov. 8. At the once-every-five-years
event, key leadership positions are to be reassigned in what
observers expect to be a major changing of the guard, from older
leaders such as Jiang to a younger generation of officials.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang, who recently turned 76, has been widely expected to give up
his position as the party's general secretary at the congress and
then surrender the presidency at another political gathering in
March.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation is rife that he may try to hang on to all three jobs,
but no one outside the uppermost echelons of power knows either the
answer to that question or the extent of whatever internal power
struggles are supposedly taking place in the run-up to the congress.</TE>

<HD>Schroeder Ahead by a Hair After TV Debate</HD>
<DH>Germany: Those polled say the incumbent carried himself in
a more statesmanlike manner than his challenger for chancellorship,
Stoiber.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Bavarian Gov. Edmund Stoiber took
their neck-and-neck race to lead Germany into the homes of millions
Sunday with a rigorous televised debate that polls showed the
incumbent won despite appearing uncharacteristically stiff and
defensive.</LD>
<LD>   The first televised clash between chancellor candidates in German
history surprised most analysts, because the telegenic and easygoing
Schroeder had been expected to dominate the exchange in style if not
in substance.</LD>
<LD>   But Stoiber took an aggressive tack from the onset, hammering at
his opponent's failure to reduce 10% unemployment despite having made
that his No. 1 campaign promise when he was elected four years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Confident and well-prepared, the 60-year-old challenger lashed out
at Schroeder's economic record, repeatedly challenging him to explain
why he should be reelected when he has been unable to deliver the
economic turnaround German voters have demanded.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder stuck to a statesmanlike solemnity under Stoiber's
persistent needling--a demeanor viewers apparently considered
dignified. In a telephone poll of 2,237 viewers conducted by the
Forsa institute, Schroeder won higher marks on all three qualities
measured: pleasantness, competence and credibility.</TE>
<TE>   Two other polls, for public broadcasters ARD and ZDF, split in
their assessments of which candidate "won" the debate.</TE>
<TE>   "Viewers apparently liked that [Schroeder] remained calm and
businesslike. They see that as a more competent response than
engaging in a fight," observed political analyst Stefan Aust of the
poll results. He, like others on hand for the live broadcast, thought
Stoiber had turned in the more impressive performance.</TE>
<TE>   Although Schroeder has long outpolled Stoiber in one-on-one
personality contests, his Social Democratic Party trails the
Bavarian's Christian Social Union and its Christian Democrat partner
by between 1 and 3 percentage points. The debate was seen as a chance
for Schroeder to narrow that gap by swaying some of the more than 30%
of voters who are still undecided four weeks before the vote
scheduled Sept. 22.</TE>
<TE>   "Schroeder didn't put on a very good performance despite
expectations, and Stoiber, well, he was Stoiber," event planner and
society critic Beate Wedekind told ZDF television in one of many
postmortems aired as soon as the candidates stopped speaking. "I put
the score at 0-0, as neither of them took advantage of their
opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   Stoiber, often pedantic and saddled with an off-putting Bavarian
accent, did manage to tarnish Schroeder's recently boosted image as a
cool head in a crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Since flooding swept through eastern Germany earlier this month,
inflicting billions of dollars in damage and washing away years of
post-reunification labor, Schroeder has been seen as more sincere and
engaged than his challenger and has won high marks for swiftly
drafting a financing package for recovery. But Stoiber caustically
remarked that even the massive reconstruction effort won't mask the
fundamental flaws in the government's tax and labor policies.</TE>
<TE>   "Without tax relief for small businesses, we won't see any
improvement in the unemployment figures," Stoiber charged, calling
the incumbent's economic policies "an absolute catastrophe."</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder repeated his vow to keep Germany out of any U.S.-led
invasion of Iraq unless and until the U.N. Security Council endorses
such action. Stoiber deftly lacerated that position while refraining
from any commitment to do otherwise should he become chancellor.</TE>
<TE>   "No German chancellor from either party would take part in any
military adventure," Stoiber observed, while noting that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein is an internationally recognized war
criminal and widely thought to be producing weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "But I consider it irresponsible to exclude even a theoretical
option," Stoiber said of Schroeder's position, hinting that Hussein
could be emboldened by the knowledge that North Atlantic Treaty
Organization allies are divided over how to deal with him.</TE>
<TE>   While Stoiber clearly scored better on economic issues, Schroeder
probably won over voters shaken by the devastating flooding with his
emphasis on the government's commitment to environmental protection,
renewable energy development and compliance with the 1997 Kyoto
Protocol, which is aimed at halting global warming.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be the ones who bring Kyoto out of the realm of theory
and into real practice," Schroeder said, noting that Germany has
already cut greenhouse gas emissions by twice as much as all other
European countries put together.</TE>
<TE>   The chancellor also plucked heartstrings with a tribute to the
unity and camaraderie exhibited by Germans amid the flooding
disaster.</TE>
<TE>   "Powerful forces have been set free in hardship--a readiness to
help others, to work together, to shoulder the load equally. There is
a new quality of solidarity and commitment to the common good," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of its novelty, the debate was treated here like a
historical event. More than 300 celebrities, politicians and artists
sipped wine and nibbled canapes as they watched the candidates on
monitors in an adjacent hall of the Adlerhof TV station, from which
the debate was aired by private broadcasters RTL and Sat.1.</TE>
<TE>   The networks estimated that they drew 70% of the national
audience. In Grimma, a town hard hit by the flooding, a big-screen TV
was set up in the main square so those without homes or electricity
could still watch.</TE>
<TE>   The televised clash had been the subject of media speculation for
weeks, as columnists and commentators contrasted the contenders'
media savvy and debated the merit of personalizing what comes down to
a choice between parties. Germans do not directly elect their
chancellor but rather the party that will advance its top candidate
to the office.</TE>
<TE>   While unlikely to be as decisive as the 1960 showdown between John
F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, Germany's first televised debate could
inject more personal dynamics into a campaign that has been lacking
flair. To date, the only sparks that have flown were in a short-lived
squabble over whether Schroeder dyes his hair.</TE>
<TE>   The debate was unprecedented in Germany because previous
incumbents have been unwilling to give their rivals a chance to shine
on prime-time television. Stoiber proposed the U.S.-style showdown
when he was handily ahead of Schroeder in the polls, and the
incumbent accepted the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   It was something of a political risk for both candidates, as
German voters tend to regard election campaigns more seriously than
do Americans. Party conventions have little of the pageantry and
celebratory atmosphere of U.S. conventions, and too much television
exposure tends to draw accusations of "showmanship"--frowned upon by
older Germans, who consider it unseemly.</TE>

<HD>Georgia Trying to Tame the Wild Pankisi Gorge</HD>
<DH>Caucasus: No arrests are made as Interior Ministry forces
move in to establish order. Russia complains that the response is
late.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Interior Ministry troops in Georgia cautiously launched an operation
Sunday to try to bring the country's lawless Pankisi Gorge under
control, rolling in and setting up seven checkpoints but making no
arrests.</LD>
<LD>   The Pankisi operation, a major test for the former Soviet
republic's ragged and demoralized forces, will be closely watched by
both the U.S., which fears the gorge could be a refuge for Islamic
militants, and Russia, which has long been pressing Georgia to clear
the area of rebels from neighboring Chechnya.</LD>
<LD>   But there was no element of surprise in an operation that was
announced more than a week ago, giving Chechen separatists and local
criminals alike plenty of time to abandon the area.</LD>
<TE>   The gorge in northeastern Georgia has long been a haven for
criminals involved in kidnapping, extortion and violence. Moreover,
it has a reputation as a sanctuary for the rebels fighting Russian
forces across the border in Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   It took U.S. pressure and military training to nudge Georgian
authorities to take action to bring the gorge under control.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces have been training Georgian soldiers in anti-terrorist
operations since May, after President Eduard A. Shevardnadze appealed
to Washington for help.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's operation coincides with army exercises in an area near
the gorge that involve 1,500 Georgian troops, several hundred of them
trained by U.S. Special Forces soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   But Georgian officials said it was unlikely that the Defense
Ministry troops would be ordered into the gorge.</TE>
<TE>   Paata Gomelauri, a Georgian Interior Ministry spokesman, declined
to disclose the number of Interior Ministry forces who went into the
gorge Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "The troops in the gorge are backed up with tanks and armored
personnel carriers. So far, no shooting has been reported. No arrests
have been made either," he said in a telephone interview. "We expect
our troops to proceed to the active stage of the operation in the
next few days."</TE>
<TE>   Georgian officials did say Sunday that there would be no
house-to-house raids or searches--the kind of operations used by
Russia to round up suspected guerrillas in Chechnya. Any arrests
would be carefully targeted, based on intelligence information, the
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Feeling constant unwanted interference from Russia since the fall
of the Soviet Union, Georgia has turned to the U.S. and Europe for
support. Its progress toward democracy and stability has been
disappointing, however, because of Shevardnadze's failure to grapple
effectively with crime and corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Shevardnadze said the aim of Sunday's operation was to restore
order in the Pankisi Gorge and eliminate criminals and terrorists "if
they are present there."</TE>
<TE>   He brushed aside criticism from Russia that the operation was
belated.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite criticism by opponents who argue that the operation is
long overdue, the operation in the Pankisi Gorge has been launched at
the right time, when guarantees of its success have been created," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   These comments appeared to underscore the weakness of his
country's military forces.</TE>
<TE>   Georgian Security Minister Valery Khaburzania has made several
contradictory statements in the past about whether there were Islamic
terrorists in the Pankisi Gorge.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview on Georgian television Sunday, he avoided
specifics. He said there were few rebel fighters there but some local
criminals and some terrorists, without elaborating on how many or
whether they were Islamic terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   There are several small villages in the gorge where refugees from
Chechnya are living, linked by one road. Checkpoints were set up all
along the road, up into the mountains, according to Gomelauri.</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen how the operation will unfold in the coming
days, but roadblocks alone would be unlikely to stop Chechen rebels,
who operate out of mountain camps, slipping down to engage Russian
forces, then retreating to safety.</TE>
<TE>   In winter, when mountain passes are blocked by snow, many Chechen
fighters reportedly rest in the Pankisi Gorge, though precise numbers
are unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Russia has been at war with separatist Chechens on and off since
1994 but has never succeeded in crushing the rebel fighters despite
repeated claims of victory.</TE>
<TE>   The reported presence of fighters in Georgia is the main source of
conflict between Russia and Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Russia has repeatedly called on Georgia to bring the area under
control. On Friday, after seven or eight warplanes bombed Georgian
territory, killing one person, Georgia accused the Russian military
of carrying out the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Although Russia denied any responsibility, White House spokesman
Ari Fleischer said over the weekend that reports that the planes were
Russian were credible.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States strongly supports Georgia's independence and
territorial integrity and has welcomed similar statements by the
Russian Federation," Fleischer said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Yesterday's attacks and their denial by the Russian government,
however, belie such Russian assurances and escalate existing tension
between Russia and Georgia, just as cooperative arrangements for
regional security arrangements are emerging," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shevardnadze welcomed the statement.</TE>
<TE>   But a Russian Defense Ministry spokesman, Nikolai Deryabin,
insisted Sunday that Russia was not responsible, saying the claims
"may only arouse surprise."</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of taking concrete measures to eliminate the hotbed of
terrorism in the Pankisi Gorge, Georgia is again engaging in
political speculation," Deryabin said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Edwin Chen in Las Cruces, N.M., contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>Indian State Evacuates 12,000 Near Leaky Dam</HD>
<DH>Weather: Heavy rain causes a problem with the structure
days after another one in the central region burst, killing up to 100
people.</DH>

<DL>BHOPAL, India</DL>
<LD>Authorities in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh evacuated
about 12,000 people after an irrigation dam started leaking due to
heavy monsoon rains, an official said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the 80-year-old Ahmadpur dam started leaking Friday
night, two days after another old dam in the state burst and 100
people were feared killed.</LD>
<LD>   Bodies of 25 people have so far been recovered from Wednesday's
incident, while the fate of 75 others is still unknown, police said.</LD>
<TE>   "The leakage is minor. But we have evacuated people from the
surrounding 12 villages as a precautionary measure," police Supt.
Zaidi Prasad said.</TE>
<TE>   He said water resources department officials were trying to plug
the leak.</TE>
<TE>   The Ahmadpur dam, about 190 miles east of Bhopal, the state
capital, is one of 832 minor semi-concrete earthen dams in Madhya
Pradesh used mainly for irrigation.</TE>
<TE>   State water resources department officials said more than 100 of
these dams in the state needed urgent repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 1,000 people have died in eastern India, Nepal and
Bangladesh since the middle of July after monsoon rains triggered
widespread flooding, landslides and disease.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Eight people were killed and nine were wounded Sunday when Western
coalition planes bombed targets in southern Iraq, an Iraqi military
spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Britain and the United States said coalition planes attacked Iraqi
radar after aircraft had come under threat. A British Defense
Ministry spokesman declined to say whether British or U.S.
aircraft--or both--were involved.</LD>
<LD>   Iraq said U.S. and British planes flew 35 sorties using air bases
in Kuwait.</LD>
<TE>   "The enemy attacked civilian and service installations in Basra
province, killing eight people and wounding nine others," the
spokesman said. It was not clear who the victims were.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's ground air defenses fired at the planes, the spokesman
added.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Central Command headquarters in Florida said in a statement
that in response to recent Iraqi hostile acts, "coalition aircraft
used precision-guided weapons today to strike two air defense radar
systems" near the city of Basra, which is 275 miles southeast of
Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "Coalition aircraft never target civilian populations or
infrastructures and go to painstaking lengths to avoid injury to
civilians," the U.S. said, adding that damage assessment was still
going on.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and British pilots are policing two "no-fly" zones in
northern and southern Iraq set up after the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
The zones, which Baghdad does not recognize, were imposed to protect
a Kurdish enclave in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from
any air attacks by the Iraqi government.</TE>

<HD>Reaching Arabs Via Airwaves</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Radio Sawa, compliments of the U.S. government,
has the attention of Middle East youths. But not everyone is into its
groove.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONNI EFRON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>It's 4:15 p.m. and Nasser Husseini, a commando in America's new war
of influence in the Middle East, is bopping and sweating inside his
tiny glass box in the bowels of the Voice of America building.</LD>
<LD>   Husseini doesn't read the news. He pours it into the mike, fast
and fluid, punctuating each headline with an electronic exclamation
mark. Then comes the hit music.</LD>
<LD>   You've heard the sound a million times on commercial radio. This,
however, is Radio Sawa, compliments of the U.S. government. And there
are no commercials. The AM/FM Arabic-language station went on the air
in March, beamed across much of the Middle East in place of the
traditional Voice of America shortwave broadcasts.</LD>
<TE>   And Middle East youth actually appear to be listening. Sawa has
already become the No. 1 music station in Amman, the Jordanian
capital.</TE>
<TE>   Sawa is being hailed as a model for how the United States ought to
revamp its troubled communications with the Muslim world. Reaching
the youth who make up 60% of the Arab population--and who are the
targets of Islamic fundamentalist recruiting--is seen as especially
important.</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite its success--or because of it--Radio Sawa has plenty
of detractors, at home and in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Sawa's skeptics say its pop music and punchy newscasts may well
appeal to Arab youth but won't mitigate hostility bred by unpopular
U.S. policies, poverty, corrupt local regimes or Islamic
fundamentalism.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, argues Sawa news director Mouafac Harb, "Winning
hearts and minds cannot happen before winning ears."</TE>
<TE>   Some of America's Middle East allies--including Egypt, the
recipient of nearly $2 billion in U.S. aid this year--haven't allowed
Sawa's signal to be transmitted.</TE>
<TE>   One Arab editorialist dismissed Sawa as slick propaganda, and
expressed hope that if kids listen to the music, they'll at least
tune out the news. But Jordanian Information Minister Mohammed Adwan,
whose 15-year-old daughter tunes in, wants Jordanian radio to copy
it.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. critics who find no bias so far in Sawa's brief newscasts
still question whether the station will be able to hold its audience
if, under political pressure to give taxpayers their money's worth,
it begins to broadcast more speeches and statements by the American
government. Already, it is lengthening its newscasts.</TE>
<TE>   And Voice of America journalists question whether Sawa's news will
be as unbiased or as substantive as its predecessor's because it's
not under the sober VOA's centralized control. At risk, they say, is
the VOA's journalistic reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "I've risked my life for this organization," said one veteran VOA
staffer. "I'm willing to do it for journalism, but I'll be damned if
I'll do it for propaganda."</TE>
<TE>   VOA staffers are also up in arms over a suggestion that
budget-cutters might close five overseas news bureaus, including Hong
Kong, in order to pay for a new Sawa-style broadcast in Persian.</TE>
<TE>   'Let "Them" Know "Us" '</TE>
<TE>   Trenchant questions also come from both Western and Middle Eastern
intellectuals who challenge what they see as the flawed underlying
premise of U.S. overseas broadcasting: that to know America is to
love America.</TE>
<TE>   The United States' most fundamental foreign policy problem, they
argue, is precisely the perception that superpower America believes
itself superior--and thus gives only lip service to the views of
other nations.</TE>
<TE>   "If the U.S. government will invest millions of dollars to let
'us' know 'them,' will it also strive to let 'them' know 'us'?" the
Cairo-based Al Ahram newspaper asked in its online edition. "We must
stand up and postulate the outrageous assumption that in order for us
to know the American people, appreciate their ideals and value
system, they will have to know the same about us, the Arabs."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the White House broadened its public diplomacy effort
with a new Office of Global Communications to tell America's story to
the world. The goal is to counter misinformation, disinformation,
hatemongering and anti-Americanism; to show that the U.S. is not
anti-Muslim; to better explain U.S. policies; and to build global
support for Washington's declared war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Sawa, the brainchild of Los Angeles-based radio mogul Norman J.
Pattiz, was launched with $35 million from Congress, and the Bush
administration has requested an additional $21.7 million to expand in
2003.</TE>
<TE>   Now Pattiz, chairman of the Middle East committee for the
Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees the VOA, is working
on a proposal for a U.S.-owned 24-hour Middle East satellite
television network. He estimates that it would cost $160 million to
compete with Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based satellite network that is
hugely popular in the Middle East but notorious in the United States
for broadcasting tapes of Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics wonder whether that money might be better spent promoting
public health or cultural exchanges. Pattiz argues that unless the
U.S. controls its medium, it will never be able to control the
message.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the radio station is gingerly going about proving its
critics wrong. Its weapons are reams of research about the youth
market, a reporting staff of former VOA Arabic service employees
edited by experienced Arab American journalists, and top American
radio management talent.</TE>
<TE>   Sawa insists that it doesn't do propaganda. But it doesn't do
stodgy, either.</TE>
<TE>   "Sawa" means "together" in Arabic, and its music sends the message
that the cultures of the West and the Arab world are not as estranged
as might seem.</TE>
<TE>   The 24-hour station uses the latest research techniques to decide
which tunes to play and how often. Sawa is the only radio station
broadcasting in Arabic in the Middle East that alternates between
Arab and Western songs, said Bert Kleinman, a veteran radio
programmer who fine-tunes Sawa's format.</TE>
<TE>   A Pleasing Mixture</TE>
<TE>   The musical combination is not as unlikely as it might seem. While
Western music is incorporating more Latin elements from the likes of
Ricky Martin, Arab popular music is importing Western dance beats and
Spanish and Greek influences, Kleinman said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, three-fourths of listeners in Sawa's target age range, 17
to 28, told pollsters that they want to hear both Arab and Western
music.</TE>
<TE>   Only 2% of Arab listeners tuned in to the VOA, which was broadcast
only on shortwave. But 42% of the 100 young fans of Arab and Western
music polled in Amman in Sawa's latest weekly survey said it is the
station they listen to most.</TE>
<TE>   More significant, the percentage of respondents who said Sawa is
their first choice for news had shot up from 1% on July 1 to 18% by
Aug. 12, while those listening to the BBC for news fell from 15% to
5%. That's striking, because Jordan's population is 60% Palestinian
and deeply aggrieved by U.S. policy toward Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Pattiz, who founded the Westwood One radio network, said he was
"blown away" by the results.</TE>
<TE>   Seven teenage girls sipping sodas at the Planet Hollywood in Amman
last week did indeed swoon over Radio Sawa--but not for the news.</TE>
<TE>   "I like that they put good English songs on and good Arabic
songs," 14-year-old Nafsika Skouti said. "But there is too much news.
It's boring. Maybe older people would like it."</TE>
<TE>   But the girls' table fell silent when they were told that Sawa is
sponsored by Uncle Sam-- although the station announces this clearly.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate Bush," declared Skouti's sister Stephanie, 13.</TE>
<TE>   "We should be telling the Americans what is happening here,"
Nafsika said. "They don't understand us.... They think they know us.
I have nothing against Americans, I just don't like the way they
think."</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of such attitudes, Sawa is taking an indirect approach.</TE>
<TE>   There are features on what's new in film, computer and video
games, and science. There's "Sawa chat," with the voices of young
Arab men and women on the street weighing in on such questions as
"Can women be good bosses?" "How do you know if the news media are
telling the truth?" and that perennial teen theme, "Do you think your
parents understand you?"</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to promote thoughtful free expression without asking,
"What do you think of American foreign policy?" Kleinman said.</TE>
<TE>   Sawa gets about 150 e-mails a day from listeners across the Middle
East.</TE>
<TE>   Lately there have been messages from Iraq, where a separate
broadcast with news and accents targeted to Iraqi listeners is being
beamed in from Kuwait. So far, the fan mail has been positive,
Kleinman said, as in the case of the Iraqi who e-mailed to say "it
brought me a lot of joy."</TE>
<TE>   Sawa's news staff is well aware that any U.S. program faces
instant suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   "The facts, only the facts, only the facts, the facts!" newscaster
Husseini, a Moroccan-born journalist who worked for Al Jazeera
"before they became so big," insisted, jabbing his index finger
aloft. "We are very aware not to be labeled a government mouthpiece.
We earn our credibility."</TE>
<TE>   Sawa is bound by the VOA charter, which requires it to be
"accurate, objective and comprehensive." News director Harb, a
Lebanese-born U.S. citizen who has worked at ABC's "Nightline"
program and the Saudi-owned Al Hayat newspaper, also expects his
broadcasts to pass a sniff test for cultural sensitivity.</TE>
<TE>   "We respect our listeners. We do not condescend," he said. "These
are the most sophisticated consumers in the world in terms of
detecting propaganda."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking Carefully</TE>
<TE>   Harb also polices the politically charged language of Middle East
politics.</TE>
<TE>   To the shock of some listeners, Sawa uses the Arabic words for
"suicide bomber" instead of the religious term "martyr" or the word
fedayeen, a secular term for someone who sacrifices himself for a
cause, both commonly used in the Arabic media to describe Palestinian
attacks on Israelis, Harb said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a hugely emotional part of the world where a headline will
make people take to the streets and get hurt," the 35-year-old said.
"We're noninflammatory."</TE>
<TE>   But Harb has journalistic differences with his VOA counterpart
over how the war on terrorism will be covered on U.S.-owned airwaves.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, VOA news director Andre de Nesnera was accused of
giving a platform to terrorists by airing sound bites from an
interview with onetime Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar.</TE>
<TE>   De Nesnera, a revered journalist, said he stands by the story and
would air it again. Harb says he would not have aired tape of
Omar--or, for that matter, of Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "Commercial-free does not mean mass murderers can have commercials
on our airwaves," he said. "The only news bite I will use for Saddam
Hussein is when he says, 'I am surrendering.' "</TE>

<HD>Sobering Up After an Environmental Binge</HD>
<DH>Summit: World leaders gather at a U.N. conference to set a
course of action for development that the Earth can withstand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>Like a college student at a frat party, much of the world is on a
binge.</LD>
<LD>   Oil and gas are being consumed faster than ever. Emissions of
pollutants and global-warming gases are at an all-time high. Forests
are shrinking. Market fish are being pulled from the sea faster than
they can repopulate. And 11,000 species, including one in four
mammals, are threatened with extinction.</LD>
<LD>   Although President Bush is a very notable no-show, more than 100
presidents and prime ministers and even a sprinkling of kings will
join a cast of thousands at a U.N. summit opening here today on how
to sustain the Earth. The last time the world's leaders gathered like
this was in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. At that meeting, trumpeted boldly
around the globe as the Earth Summit, delegates signed pledges to
slow, if not stop, the degradation of the planet.</LD>
<TE>   They didn't. Most indicators show its health getting worse. So
leaders have been arriving here a bit warily, but also determined to
show tangible progress.</TE>
<TE>   "By and large, the picture is bleak," Nitin Desai,
secretary-general of what is being called the World Summit on
Sustainable Development, said in an interview. "So the main point of
this summit is action, not on all fronts, but in critical areas where
we need a quantum change."</TE>
<TE>   This time, summit leaders will push a strategy they hope will lead
to quicker action. Instead of waiting for all nations to sign a
treaty before setting to work, U.N. officials are nudging clusters of
governments, businesses and citizen groups to forge partnerships to
get moving on a specific problem or in one region--and hoping the
momentum builds.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these partnerships, it is anticipated, will focus on
helping the nearly 3 billion people who live in poverty gain access
to clean water, proper sanitation and energy--much of it from
renewable sources such as solar and wind or from alternative fuels
derived from sugar cane or corn.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is simple: Help Third World nations develop in such a way
that they can leapfrog over past mistakes in the United States and
elsewhere that resulted in polluting the air, the water and the land
in the name of convenience and economic progress.</TE>
<TE>   Other partnerships are expected to tackle pollution in the
developed world that is contributing to global warming and posing
other threats to the environment, to endangered species and to human
health. Such global issue networks may focus on everything from
halting overfishing to reducing reliance on fossil fuels to phasing
out cancer-causing chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to change the way people act," Desai said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   He and other leaders acknowledged that won't be easy. But they
said that the 104 heads of state and government and other national
leaders have committed themselves to the summit, creating a "critical
mass" of world leadership to get things done.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though President Bush won't be here, the conference will be
just as successful," said Nkosazana Zuma, South Africa's foreign
minister.</TE>
<TE>   Bush announced last week that he would not attend the summit and
was dispatching Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to lead the U.S.
delegation, but only during the final days of the nearly two-week
gathering. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christie
Whitman will join the delegation.</TE>
<TE>   To soften criticism of its go-it-alone policy on the summit, the
Bush administration does plan to announce an additional $4.5 billion
in programs to assist developing nations deal with shortages of
water, energy and food, and to preserve forests in the Congo Basin.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting with foreign journalists last week, Paula J. Dobriansky,
the State Department's undersecretary for global affairs, downplayed
the environmental focus of the Johannesburg, South Africa, summit.
She characterized it as more of an economic forum, a continuation of
the administration's efforts at a trade gathering in Doha, Qatar, in
November and a development summit in March in Monterrey, Mexico. In
Monterrey, the U.S. pledged $5 billion to developing countries that
adopt sound economic policies and fight corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "This summit is about sustainable development," Dobriansky said.
"That means we're talking about economic reform, we're talking about
environmental stewardship, and we're talking about a social
agenda.... A combination of all three."</TE>
<TE>   The president's decision to skip the meeting caused a pileup of
domestic conservation groups and Democratic politicians to denounce
his "snub" of fellow world figures and his forfeiture of leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Criticism also is expected from European delegates, who are
frustrated at the lack of leadership from the world's biggest
polluter when it comes to greenhouse gases.</TE>
<TE>   While European countries reduced carbon dioxide emissions by about
2% between 1990 and 2000, greenhouse-gas emissions surged by 18% in
the United States, according to statistics compiled by the United
Nations and others. The statistics show that the United States is now
responsible for 24% of such emissions worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Bush has delighted some of his conservative constituents by
turning his back on the summit. A group of conservative
organizations, ranging from the Competitive Enterprise Institute to
the Texas Eagle Forum and Americans Against U.N. Control, wrote him a
letter praising him for shunning the "anti-freedom, anti-people,
anti-globalization and anti-Western agendas."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Taylor, of the libertarian Cato Institute, said that by not
attending, Bush spoiled the fun of his European critics.</TE>
<TE>   "They had hoped to beat on the president like a Mexican pinata for
his refusal to go along with the Kyoto Protocol and the rest of their
environmental agenda," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Johannesburg summit is the third in a series of such
international meetings. The first, the U.N. Conference on the Human
Environment in Stockholm in 1972, inspired developed nations to begin
dealing with acid rain. The second was the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio,
which led to treaties on global warming and biodiversity as well as
an action plan for the 21st century, called Agenda 21.</TE>
<TE>   Yet most of that agenda, with its 4,000 recommendations, has
gathered dust. So the U.N. began pushing for this conference.</TE>
<TE>   Delegates again will haggle over the language of goals, timetables
and political statements. Mainly, their focus is expected to be on
how to move beyond the goals adopted in Rio with partnerships and
projects that translate words into action.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost all countries have had to do studies on what they've done
since 1992 and have filed reports," said Elizabeth R. DeSombre, a
Wellesley College professor of environmental studies who will attend
the summit. "The mere fact of gathering the information mobilizes
people to do things."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown, the former California governor who will
also be an attendee, said that in many instances, local governments
are stepping into the breach.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is complacency at the top in the Bush administration,"
he said, "there has to be more activism at the bottom."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign to eliminate leaded gasoline is frequently cited as a
model of how environmental programs can grow. It began with a
partnership between the United Nations and the World Bank and slowly
spread to more than 50 countries. Now, about 86% of the world's fuel
supply is lead-free--greatly reducing a toxin that can cause brain
damage, particularly in children.</TE>
<TE>   "What's so exciting is that so many different institutions are
trying to figure out how to move forward," said Jacob Scherr,
director of international programs for the Natural Resources Defense
Council. "I like to call it the down-to-earth summit."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Elizabeth Shogren in Washington contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>State's Poverty Profile Changes</HD>
<DH>Economics: In contrast to the U.S., nearly half of
impoverished children in California live in a two-parent household.
Most are the offspring of at least one immigrant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a booming economy in the late 1990s, California's child
poverty rates remain stubbornly high, even though the state's poor
youngsters are more likely to live in a family with a working parent
than those in the United States as a whole.</LD>
<LD>   These are some of the findings in a study on California's child
poverty being released today showing that the state's changing
demographics are defying conventional definitions of who is poor.</LD>
<LD>   Welfare reform advocates have long touted work and marriage as a
way for low-income families to escape poverty. But in California,
many poor immigrants are already doing just that.</LD>
<TE>   In contrast to the rest of the nation, where most poor children
live in a household headed by a single parent, nearly half of
California's poor kids live in a two-parent household, according to
research by the New York-based National Center for Children in
Poverty, which is affiliated with Columbia University's School of
Public Health. The center found that most poor youngsters in
California are the offspring of at least one immigrant parent, and
that poor immigrant families are more likely to include a breadwinner
than are U.S.-born families in poverty.</TE>
<TE>   "The stereotype of the typical low-income kid is really being
challenged by what is happening in California," said researcher
Julian Palmer, lead author of the study. "You might think the typical
poor kid lives with a single mother on welfare. In fact, in
California they are just as likely to be living with both parents and
much more likely to be living in a working family than not."</TE>
<TE>   Poverty experts said the study underscores growing income
inequality in California, where even unprecedented job and wealth
creation in the late 1990s failed to close the state's poverty gap
with the rest of the nation. With the economy now moving at a crawl
and unemployment hitting a five-year high earlier this year, some
worry that the chasm will widen.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that a very strong economy didn't move the gauge of
child poverty as much as we might have hoped is disturbing," said Amy
Dominguez-Arms, vice president of Oakland-based Children Now, a child
research and advocacy organization. With the economy struggling, "we
would anticipate that child poverty is going to be on the upswing."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the height of the state's economic boom, 18.6%, or 2.1
million, of California children were poor, compared with 15.8%
nationwide, according to the National Center for Children in
Poverty's analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. One in six poor
children in the U.S. now lives in California, compared with one in 10
two decades ago. The poverty threshold was $17,524 annually for a
family of four in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The center's study dovetails with other research showing that
California's poverty rate, once lower than the national average,
caught up with the rest of the nation in the 1980s, surpassed it in
the 1990s and has remained consistently higher than the U.S. average
ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Poverty rates ebb and flow along with the business cycle. For
example, California's overall poverty rate has declined substantially
from its peak of 18% during the recession of the early 1990s,
according to a study released last year by the Public Policy
Institute of California.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, even the red-hot economy of the late 1990s couldn't
make a dent in the long-term trend. Over the last three decades,
California has seen its overall poverty rate grow by 3.8 percentage
points to 12.9% in 2000 from 9.1% in 1969, according to a research
report last year by the Public Policy Institute. That stands in stark
contrast to the rest of the nation, as the U.S. poverty rate fell to
11% from 12.5% over the same period.</TE>
<TE>   Experts point to a variety of factors behind California's elevated
poverty rates. For starters, California got slammed harder by the
early 1990s recession than the rest of the nation, hit by the
collapsing defense and housing sectors. Parts of the state are still
recovering. Los Angeles County, for example, has fewer nonfarm
payroll jobs today than it did in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "The early '90s was a real turning point," said Deborah Reed,
program director for the Public Policy Institute of California.
"Poverty grew much faster in California than the rest of the nation.
And although it fell in the late '90s, it has never gotten back" to
equal the U.S. level.</TE>
<TE>   Another major factor is immigration. California has become a
magnet for unskilled, mostly Latino immigrants who have found
low-wage employment in the state's restaurants, fields and factories.
Foreign-born Latinos have the highest poverty rate of any ethnic
group in California at almost 27%, according to the Public Policy
Institute of California.</TE>
<TE>   That, in turn, has had a dramatic effect on the poverty rate of
California's children, given that Latinos make up the largest segment
of state residents under age 18. According to the National Center for
Children in Poverty report, which compared data from 1996 to 2000
with an earlier five-year period, Latinos account for 61% of all poor
children in California, up from 41% in the period from 1979 to 1983.
Nearly three-fifths of poor children in California are the offspring
of at least one immigrant parent.</TE>
<TE>   With Latinos representing the future of the state's work force,
child-poverty experts say these figures present a challenge for
policymakers that could have big implications for the California
economy down the road. Though experts have promoted an intact family
structure and employment as a bulwark against poverty, the National
Center for Children in Poverty study shows the model isn't working
for many families in California. Two-thirds of poor children in
California have at least one working parent, slightly higher than the
rate nationwide, while 48% of poor kids in California live in a
two-parent family, compared with about one-third nationally.</TE>
<TE>   "They are playing by the rules, staying together and working,"
said the center's Palmer. "The big challenge is to figure out how
these families can earn a decent living to get their kids out of
poverty."</TE>
<TE>   Single-parent families are still more likely to be poor than
two-parent families, both in California and nationwide. Still, Palmer
said California's changing demographics will require policymakers
increasingly to focus on the needs of working, immigrant, two-parent
families if they hope to reverse the state's rising tide of poverty.
Recommendations include implementing a state earned-income tax credit
similar to the federal program that supplements the earnings of
low-income workers, indexing the minimum wage to inflation, providing
more child-care subsidies and upgrading the skills of low-wage
workers, among others.</TE>
<TE>   California has made some strides with programs such as Healthy
Families, a government-funded health-care program that covers
children whose families earn too much to qualify for Medi-Cal but not
enough to pay for private health insurance. However, the state's
budget woes will make it tough to roll out initiatives to assist the
children of the working poor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big problem that requires a big solution," said Steven
Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. "We are taking the right
steps, but it's a difficult thing to chip away at when you have a
large population ... and a lot of immigration."</TE>

<HD>A Myth of Hope in a Land of Tragedy</HD>

<LD>Second of three parts</LD>
<LD>   ALLENSWORTH, Calif. -- Chuck Jones had heard the stories growing
up in Oklahoma.</LD>
<LD>   Grapes as big as jade eggs and fields of cotton that didn't quit.
Row after row, mile upon mile, it was all there for the picking in a
giant valley in the middle of California.</LD>
<TE>   The son of a black tenant farmer, he could already taste the
bitter that came with the Oklahoma land. Soon enough, the debt to the
white boss man that got passed from his grandfather to his father
would get passed to him.</TE>
<TE>   So in the mid-1940s, like so many other Black Okies chasing a
myth, he took off west to the San Joaquin Valley. Here was a land
that offered the wide-open blessings of the rural without the
half-empty cotton sacks of sharecropping. He had found a new South.</TE>
<TE>   He fell in love with a woman named Margaret, who had seven
children. They married and had two of their own. They taught them a
reverence for work and a respect for the rod. In their family, the
branches of the weeping willow would be known as the branches of the
"whuppin' willow."</TE>
<TE>   Jones made sure that his children and grandchildren would grow up
knowing the seasons the way he knew them--that pomegranates meant
winter and loquats meant spring and the harvest moon meant the squeal
of pigs being neutered.</TE>
<TE>   He lived long enough to spoil his two young grandsons, Howie and
Eric, and long enough to watch his family tree stretch beyond the
alkali. He died in 1984, perhaps mercifully, never having to see that
myth turn to tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   His youngest daughter, Hallie, the mother of Howie and Eric, grew
too busy hustling crack to pass along any Black Okie dreams to her
sons.</TE>
<TE>   Howie left home at 15, joined a gang and began dealing his own
drugs. In the fall of 1998, 14 years after his grandfather's death,
he was shot dead, two bullets to the head in a beef over a craps
game.</TE>
<TE>   Eric, 17, tried to honor his big brother the only way he knew--by
joining the same rural gang. On a cold winter night last year, he
left the house wearing a T-shirt inscribed "Rest in Peace" as a
memorial to Howie.</TE>
<TE>   They found him the next morning in the plowed dirt beside a
country road near Allensworth. He was naked and hogtied. A wooden
handle protruded from his rectum and nine bullets pierced his back.
His fingers bore the marks of electrical shock. He was lying at the
edge of the old lake basin, in the same cotton fields that had
brought his grandfather west.</TE>
<TE>   Mixed Legacy</TE>
<TE>   Across a distance of six decades and thousands of miles,
heartbreak has chased the children and grandchildren and now the
great-grandchildren of the old black cotton pickers of Tulare Lake.
Highway 99, a zipper straight up the gut of California, is no longer
a road to salvation. Sunday sermons don't have to venture far to find
the bittersweet.</TE>
<TE>   Tina Houston graduates from UCLA, gets her master's degree from
Harvard while her brother, Kenneth, serves a five-year drug sentence
at Ironwood State Prison.</TE>
<TE>   Leon Richardson helps as a pastor at the House of Prayer in
Teviston while his brother, George, passes his days as an inmate at
North Kern State Prison. George's wife raises their 10 children in a
trash heap of a house where dirty plastic diapers--ripped apart by
pit bulls--snag on tumbleweeds. She is pregnant with an 11th child
conceived during a conjugal visit. She stays away from the house for
days at a time, leaving her 14-year-old daughter in charge.</TE>
<TE>   The breakdown of family structure that began five and six
generations ago in the rural South has accelerated in the rural West.
More than seven out of 10 black children in the San Joaquin Valley
are born out of wedlock. Of the 6,000 blacks in Tulare County, 45%
receive welfare or food stamps.</TE>
<TE>   Tulare may rank as the No. 1 milk producer in the world but it
stands as the poorest county in California, with nearly one-third of
its residents living below the poverty level. With so few resources
to spread around, no one--not social workers, job trainers or Head
Start administrators--is targeting the needs of the 1,500 Black Okies
scattered in rural enclaves across the lake basin.</TE>
<TE>   "Even poor people in the inner city, as bad as they have it, at
least have services nearby," said Connie Conway, a Tulare County
supervisor. "We don't have the public transit to help the rural
people even access the meager services that we do have."</TE>
<TE>   In a place so broken, even a crime as savage as the murder of Eric
"Cutty" Jones has gone down as simply one more gangbanger who turned
up dead beside a ditch in the forgotten middle of California.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the accused killers are migrants from Mexico whose
families came a generation after the Black Okies to pick the same
fields. Police say Jones made the mistake of double-crossing the men
who had given him a cut of their methamphetamine trade.</TE>
<TE>   As the case heads to trial, 19 months after the killing, it is
hardly discussed among Black Okies. The murder seems to have been
swept over, absorbed into a larger narrative of lost hope.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh yeah, that kid in the cotton field," says an old black
woman in Pixley, puffing a cigarette between her toothless gums. "Too
bad. A while back, we had a black man lying dead right here on my
road. Came out of that crack house right behind me and just died. The
county wouldn't remove him. They let him bake all day in the sun."</TE>
<TE>   Following the Harvest</TE>
<TE>   Before he arrived in the San Joaquin Valley, Chuck Jones got his
one taste of the big city. After World War II, he took a job in
Oakland as a longshoreman and watched thousands of black shipyard
workers--their industry suddenly shuttered by peace--tossed to the
wind.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the jobless had family in the valley, and Jones took off
with them to follow the cotton harvest. He landed in Delano long
before Cesar Chavez turned the town into a labor movement. It was a
step up and a dozen miles removed from the dusty black settlement of
Teviston. He made steady wages hauling grapes to the winery. His
wife, Margaret, a native of Compton, packed oranges and vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   They set down a rule for their nine children, especially the
youngest, Hallie. Be home before the sun cuts out and the street
lights twitch on. If they failed to abide, Margaret Jones stood on
the front porch holding a branch, not too thin and not too thick,
with just the right whip. "We used to get a 'just in case' whuppin,"
Hallie Jones said. "Just in case we were thinking about doing
something wrong. There were no rotten cottons in our house."</TE>
<TE>   Hallie watched three of her older brothers prove themselves on the
athletic field, graduate from Delano High School and travel the world
working for the oil companies that drilled heavy crude in Kern
County. She saw her two big sisters build careers with the post
office and mental health agencies and raise children who went to UCLA
and the University of Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   But from Day 1, the opportunities put in front of Hallie went
wasted. Six feet tall and slim, she neglected the athletic gifts that
took her cousins to college. She began smoking weed at 15, dropped
out of high school and sneaked off with Danny Chavez, a married man
down the block. Their affair was brief but it produced a baby in 1977
whom she christened Howard Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   Six years later, Eric was born, fathered by a white construction
worker she met while waiting tables. "Two flings, two babies," she
said. "I didn't consider abortion. The children were innocent. I
accepted my responsibilities. Period."</TE>
<TE>   Eric was 10 months old when Hallie met Ed Scott, a white Okie with
red hair who irrigated orchards for a Tulare County farmer. He was a
drinker and they fell hard for each other. They vowed to get clean
and headed into the tules and tumbleweeds to get away from the bad
influences. They went from cheap motel to raggedy house but the
dopers still found them. Cocaine, crack or crank--it didn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   They had six more children to go with Howie and Eric, five of them
born drug-addled. The twin girls came nine weeks premature, barely 1
1/2 pounds each. "They were born with no skin development, no lung
development," Hallie's niece, Melanie Wallace, said. "The state took
them away and that was the day she and Ed started to change their
lives."</TE>
<TE>   For firstborn Howie, it came too late. He was 12 when he started
burglarizing houses and stealing cars. He told his mother he needed
his own space. He packed his bags and moved to Bakersfield to live
with his mother's older sister, Leagla Fortson.</TE>
<TE>   She was the rock of the family, everyone's fix-it woman, but
Fortson couldn't fix Howie. She was too busy supervising the night
shift at the post office. He dropped out of school and joined the
East Side Crips, one of two black gangs fighting over pitiful turf in
Bakersfield. Howie was now H-Bone.</TE>
<TE>   Eric didn't want to listen to his cleaned-up mother and her new
rules. He missed Howie so much he decided to follow his big brother
to their aunt's house. "Both of them could take apart and put
together anything. Both could have been electricians," Fortson said.
"They'd tell me, 'Auntie Neenee, that's going to take a long time.'
I'd say, 'It's not about quickness. It's about discipline.'</TE>
<TE>   "They thought the life I was pushing on them was too slow. The
ability to delay gratification, it wasn't there."</TE>
<TE>   The crack business got so good that Howie, 21, moved out of his
aunt's house in September 1998 and rented an apartment in
Bakersfield. Three weeks later, he was dead, two .38-caliber bullets
to the head. The $1,500 he won the night before in a dice game was
gone. A tiny black youth, barely 15 years old, the same one Howie had
taken under his wing, pleaded guilty to manslaughter. After his
brother's killing, Eric moved back to Delano to live with his
grandmother. The town had grown to 38,000 residents, 60% from Mexico.
On the west side, Mexicans and blacks started calling him "Cutty,"
street slang for cousin. Everything sacred to him he now had tattooed
on his back: "H-Bone to honor his brother; "Crippin" to honor his
gang; "One Life to Live" to honor his new credo.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw Eric on Thanksgiving and he had been beat up," his mother
said. "I suspected he was doing crank. I told him, 'You know how you
make me feel? You know how you felt looking at your brother in the
coffin? Well that's how I feel looking at you right now." '</TE>
<TE>   'You're Going to Die'</TE>
<TE>   The radio in the garage was blaring, the music turned up to muffle
his cries. He was lying on the concrete floor, an AK-47 shoved into
his mouth. His wrists and ankles had been bound together behind his
back with an extension cord. Had he not been tied down, Eric Jones
would have towered over all of them.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, you're going die, Cutty. You're going to make the papers!"
one of the assailants shouted. "Do you want your casket open or
closed?"</TE>
<TE>   What happened inside the stucco house across from an almond
orchard in Delano on the night of Jan. 24, 2001, is described in the
detailed statements of three of the defendants.</TE>
<TE>   They have pleaded not guilty to charges of kidnapping, torture and
murder and face a spring trial. Two other defendants remain at large.
Defense attorneys, who have refused to comment on the case, are
expected to argue that the statements were coerced by detectives.</TE>
<TE>   Gerardo Zavala, a 28-year-old body-and-fender man, told
investigators he helped lure Eric to the garage that night and struck
the first blow. Like a game of pinata, it went around the room. Then
Jorge Vidal, a 31-year-old farm worker from Sonora, Mexico, who had
belonged to a Delano street gang, took charge.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted the pillowcase covering Eric's head removed. He wanted
to see and hear the damage he was about to inflict. Eric's face was
already so broken that Vidal couldn't recognize the boy he had
tutored in crime.</TE>
<TE>   "You messed up, Cutty!" Vidal shouted, according to his statement.
"You won't be stealing my crap again, nigger."</TE>
<TE>   "What'd I do? What'd I do?" Eric pleaded.</TE>
<TE>   Vidal told detectives he had taught Eric the ropes of crank
dealing and stealing, and Eric had betrayed his trust. A month
earlier, Vidal had caught Eric trying to steal his car. Eric ran off,
his screwdriver still stuck in Vidal's window.</TE>
<TE>   Vidal balled up his fist and struck Eric in the face, maybe 10
times. Eric could barely see the punches coming. His eyes were slits.
He cursed at Vidal and spit in his face. He fell unconscious. Vidal
woke him up only to knock him out again.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey Cutty, remember when you wanted to steal my car? You left
your screwdriver, eh? Well, I'm going to return your screwdriver."
Vidal told detectives he then grabbed a long flat screwdriver and
stuck Eric in the back.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Soto's stomach began to turn. They had chosen his house
in the Almond Trees, a new subdivision at the edge of Delano, to
carry out the beating. The 23-year-old forklift driver felt so queasy
he had to go inside and take a break with his wife and two small
children.</TE>
<TE>   His younger brother, Gerardo Soto, and 29-year-old Keith Seriales
stood there transfixed. They watched Vidal cut the end off an
electrical cord and tape the exposed wires to Eric's fingers. "Plug
him in, plug him in," one of them said, snickering.</TE>
<TE>   Vidal told the police he plugged the extension cord into the wall
and shocked Eric. Each time he took the cord out and plugged it in
again, Eric groaned. "Hey Cutty," he said. "Are you getting energized
yet?"</TE>
<TE>   They decided to take a break. The Soto brothers went on a beer run
and brought back a 24-pack of Bud Light. They began stripping
Eric--his acid washed jeans and the T-shirt inscribed "Rest in Peace"
as a memorial to his older brother. Seriales got some duct tape, and
they blindfolded Eric and secured the hogtie.</TE>
<TE>   By now, they were wearing white gloves to cover up their
fingerprints. Vidal told detectives he unscrewed the wood handle from
a squeegee and swaggered around the garage slapping it in his hands.
He took the 2-foot-long stick and began sodomizing Eric. He cried so
loud they had to turn up the music even higher. One of the assailants
stumbled to the side of the garage and vomited. Vidal laughed. "Let's
get going."</TE>
<TE>   They threw his writhing body into the trunk of a green Dodge
Intrepid and took off past the dairies and vineyards and alfalfa
fields, past the giant lights of North Kern State prison, until they
reached Allensworth.</TE>
<TE>   This was the place where freed slaves came West and founded their
own community in 1908. They stopped at a plowed cotton field not far
from the house where Eric's mother and six brothers and sisters
lived.</TE>
<TE>   They lifted him out of the trunk and dumped him in the dirt at the
side of the road. He was still breathing. Vidal told detectives he
paused for a moment trying to decide what to do. That's when two of
the men shouted, "Shoot him! Shoot him!" He told detectives he pulled
out his 9-millimeter handgun, walked up to Eric, aimed at his head
and fired once. Vidal said he paused again and then fired nine more
times into Eric's back.</TE>
<TE>   They piled in the car and headed back to Delano. It was near
midnight. They polished off the beers and smoked some crank.</TE>
<TE>   Hallie Jones swears she heard Eric's voice cry her name in the
quiet of the night. The next morning, she saw the yellow tape slicing
the corner of Avenue 16 and Highway 43 and knew in her gut that her
second son was dead too.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Jones had raised, in whole or part, nine children and 26
grandchildren, including Eric. She drew and cut out silhouettes of
each one of them. Sit up straight, she'd tell them. Read your Bible
and watch nature programs. You can hop from Europe to Africa, take a
side trip to Antarctica, and never leave your room.</TE>
<TE>   Eric was living with her at the time of the murder. She had fallen
asleep early that night and when she awoke her grandson was gone. She
pressed her daughters for details. How many times had he been shot?
What did the death certificate say? A wood handle? Why?</TE>
<TE>   "I close my eyes and see it," she said. "The thought of my
grandchild lying on the side of the road. 'Naked,' the paper had it.
'Hogtied.' What kind of hate? What kind of hate?"</TE>
<TE>   Six months after the murder, the Jones family, minus its
matriarch, drove to the courthouse in Tulare to attend a pretrial
hearing. Three women who had cared for Eric at different times in his
life--his mother, his aunt, an older cousin--sat in a park and waited
for the case to be called. They would be eye-to-eye with Zavala and
Vidal and Seriales for the first time. The Soto brothers, who had
disappeared that night, were still at large.</TE>
<TE>   Hallie Jones insisted that she had no bitterness in her heart.</TE>
<TE>   Six years earlier, she had transformed her life by rediscovering
the religious beliefs that had sustained her family all the way back
to slavery. She said she had forgiven her son's killers and found a
kind of peace knowing that Eric, in the days before his death, had
made his own pact with God. She had his letters as proof. "I hate
what they did," she said. "But I don't hate them. As far as I'm
concerned, all Eric felt that night were feathers. Feathers or maybe
nothing. Because God is bigger than all of us. That's what I believe
in and that's what I hold on to."</TE>
<TE>   Hallie's niece, Melanie Wallace, said she wanted something more
than platitudes. She wanted a way to explain the hate. She owed it to
her grandmother, to the black community.</TE>
<TE>   She walked inside the courthouse and read the detectives' report.
"This is different than Howie's murder," Wallace said. "There's a
whole lot of 'nigger this' and 'nigger that' that night."</TE>
<TE>   Like Wallace, some blacks here can't shake the specter of race in
a killing so brutal. They point to the use of the "N-word" as proof
that his killers stopped seeing Eric as a partner who did them wrong
and began seeing him as a black man who had crossed them.</TE>
<TE>   Others, though, view the murder as part of the larger wasting that
has cut short the ambitions of so many of their children and
grandchildren. Eric made foolish choices, they say, and this, more
than race, explains the murder.</TE>
<TE>   Police and prosecutors point out that Eric grew up in a basin
where black, Mexican and poor white youths cruise the same farms
fields listening to the same gangsta rap. In this mix, they say, the
"N-word" is no longer a reliable indicator of prejudice. Indeed, it
has become such a motif of a shared hip-hop culture that it ceases to
carry much meaning at all.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a horrific crime," Tulare County prosecutor Carol Turner
said. "But it wasn't a hate crime."</TE>
<TE>   'I Love the Country'</TE>
<TE>   A faded turquoise house sits in the hot sun on a patch of prairie
so thick with alkali that it appears in the distance as fallen snow.</TE>
<TE>   The house skirts an old cemetery where the freed slaves who
founded Allensworth are buried beneath tumbleweeds. The mailbox says
"Jones and Scott" and "To God Be the Glory." A white man with red
hair stands over a fire of grape stumps, cooking hot dogs and steaks.
A tall black woman in an African skullcap leans back in a lawn chair
and smiles at the children swimming in a plastic pool and dancing in
the dust to a stereo blasting Christian rap--"Gangsters for Jesus."</TE>
<TE>   Hallie Jones and Ed Scott had come all this way, 10 miles from the
nearest mini-mart, 12 miles from the nearest movie house, to reclaim
their lives. Six years sober, six years right with God, and it made
no difference in the fate of Hallie's sons. Eric ended up just like
Howie, only worse.</TE>
<TE>   Hallie and her husband were doing their best to protect their
younger children, to bend destiny a different way. She counseled
youths at the community center, volunteered with the Salvation Army
and got a job pulling weeds in a cotton field outside her front door.
She straddled the knee-high plants and moved up and down the rows,
but when the workday was done she seemed troubled.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since that first day in court when she confronted the
defendants, their faces so indifferent, she could no longer see
things so tidy. Now the trial was approaching and she was doubting
the compassion that had gotten her through the darkest time. How
could she forgive them with such unforgiving facts?</TE>
<TE>   "There's no word to describe his end," she says of Eric. "
'Torture' doesn't do it. Neither does 'desecration.' What they did to
my son is unlisted."</TE>
<TE>   The field where they left Eric's body has been sown again to
cotton, and soon the pink flowers will turn into puffs of popcorn
white. She has driven by it a hundred times but never once stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "People ask why I still live here. So close to so much pain," she
says. "But I have no desire to live in the city. The murder of my
sons could have happened there just as easily as here.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the country. And it's good for the kids. You can see the
stars at night and hear the barn owls screech. And the wind, it feels
free."</TE>

<HD>History Echoes as Farm Workers Rally for Bill</HD>
<DH>Labor: Bid to establish binding arbitration puts pressure
on Davis, a UFW ally in '75 triumph.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGG JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Thousands of farm workers rallied at the state Capitol on Sunday,
passionately pressing their case for legislation that would
profoundly transform the relationship between laborers and growers in
California.</LD>
<LD>   The farm workers and their supporters, concluding a 150-mile march
through the Central Valley that evoked the historic campaigns led by
the late Cesar Chavez, called on Gov. Gray Davis to sign a bill that
is forcing the governor to choose between the state's biggest
business and his labor base.</LD>
<LD>   "Gov. Davis, don't do the wrong thing, because we will remember
it!" shouted Dolores Huerta, the fiery co-founder of the United Farm
Workers, as UFW flags fluttered and farm workers and their families
cheered.</LD>
<TE>   The confrontation is over SB 1736, a Senate bill that would arm
farm workers with a mighty hammer: the right to binding arbitration
in contract negotiations with growers.</TE>
<TE>   The UFW says the bill is needed to fulfill the original vision of
the landmark Agricultural Labor Relations Act, signed in 1975. The
union contends that the law has been thwarted by growers who have
exploited loopholes to avoid signing union contracts. Leaders say
Davis can fulfill the law's intent and deliver long-overdue justice
to poor farm workers by signing SB 1736.</TE>
<TE>   Growers, however, say the bill is a draconian remedy that would
drive many California farms out of business. They are asking Davis to
veto the bill, and signals from administration insiders suggest the
governor will do just that.</TE>
<TE>   Behind that debate is a larger tug of history, one that the farm
workers are summoning as they urge Davis to sign the bill. In 1975,
Cesar Chavez and his United Farm Workers were on the march and
Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown was poised to change the course of
California social history with the stroke of his pen.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Gray Davis was Brown's chief of staff, a good guy in the
eyes of many farm workers and their supporters, a man on the right
side of history and social justice. Now, 27 years later, a resurgent
UFW is once again appealing to Davis--onetime lieutenant to one of
California's most liberal chief executives and a politician who has
proudly charted a centrist course in his own tenure as governor.</TE>
<TE>   Davis aides say the governor is torn by the dilemma presented by
his conflicting desires to be a friend to the UFW while still
supporting the state's largest industry. They have not definitively
said that Davis will veto the bill, but have stressed his previous
support for farm workers and organized labor--leading some to
conclude that the administration is trying to prepare its labor
allies for a disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the governor say there is a cold political calculation
to Davis' angst: Unions are the single biggest source of campaign
cash for Davis, although the working-poor members of the UFW aren't
major donors. But the growers, too, have contributed heavily to the
Davis reelection campaign. Indeed, Davis attended a fund-raiser held
by growers the day before the Legislature gave final approval to the
arbitration bill.</TE>
<TE>   The UFW says that if Davis allows conscience--rather than cash--to
govern his decision, he will sign the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be a no-brainer for a governor who sat next to Jerry
Brown during the signing of the Agricultural Labor Relations Act in
1975, understanding the need that the farm workers have," said Arturo
Rodriguez, UFW president and the son-in-law of Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John Burton (D-San Francisco), the bill's author and Davis'
reliable liberal adversary in the Legislature, is even blunter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a clear thing, a choice between farm workers and the big
money in agriculture," Burton said in an interview. A Davis veto
"will do irreparable harm to his relationship with the Legislature.
There's going to be a price."</TE>
<TE>   Farm workers say the evidence is clear that the current law isn't
working as envisioned: Of the 428 elections the union has won since
the law was passed in 1975, only 158 contracts with growers have been
signed--a rate much lower than in other industries, the UFW says.
Growers attribute the lack of contracts to the union's negotiating
ineptitude, an allegation that the union describes as racist.</TE>
<TE>   UFW spokesman Marc Grossman says a Ventura case involving
Pictsweet Mushroom Farms is a "poster child" for the grower tactics
that make SB 1736 a necessity.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the 1975 law was signed, a majority of workers at
the Ventura farm voted for UFW representation. The company and
workers agreed on a contract that guaranteed incremental raises and
medical benefits.</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, however, Tennessee-based United Foods Inc. bought the
bankrupt Ventura farm and convinced workers to accept pay cuts and a
temporary suspension of the union contract.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since, the UFW has been trying to negotiate a contract with
Pictsweet. And after 15 years, workers say they have nothing to show
for their efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes to negotiating the core things like wages, pensions
and medical benefits, the negotiations just stop," said Manuel
Salomon, 59, who has worked at the Ventura farm for 22 years and
earns about $23,000 a year picking mushrooms in dangerous, cave-like
conditions. "The lawyer for the company would just get mad, say,
We'll see you later,' and set a date real far in the future for the
next negotiations."</TE>
<TE>   Pictsweet did not return calls seeking a comment for this story.
The company and its parent have declined to comment on the
arbitration bill and the Ventura labor dispute in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Farm workers and their supporters say the bill's passage would
force companies like Pictsweet to negotiate in good faith or face the
possibility of having a contract imposed by an arbitrator.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a simple bill, closing the loophole so that when these
people vote for union representation they can sign a contract and
therefore have a little more dignity in their lives," said
Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Panoroma City), the son of a farm worker
and one of several legislators who have demonstrated their support
for the bill in recent days by participating in the UFW march, fasts
and vigils.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we don't have an equal playing field, and some growers
are not acting in good faith," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Growers say the 1975 farm labor law already gives workers the
legal power to punish farm owners if they refuse to bargain in good
faith with workers seeking a union contract--power that farm workers
say the growers have rendered useless with endless legal challenges.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a pretty profound bill with an incredible impact for the
industry," said Mike Webb, a lobbyist for the Western Growers Assn.,
which represents 3,500 growers. "We're hoping that the powers that be
will see through all the propaganda and see the true facts of this
bill, which would drive up costs and cause family farms to go out of
business."</TE>
<TE>   Davis aides, perhaps preparing farm workers for a veto, are
circulating a two-page list of bills on Latino and labor
issues--including some UFW-sponsored bills--the governor has signed
into law over the last four years. One honors the birthday of Cesar
Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor has been with the UFW down the line," said Davis
spokesman Steven Maviglio.</TE>
<TE>   But, for the moment, at least, all that seems like ancient history
to UFW members and their impassioned supporters. Davis suddenly finds
himself facing the sort of pressure tactics once used so effectively
to shame the conservative status quo and Republican politicians.</TE>
<TE>   At Sunday's rally, a string of erstwhile Davis allies--ranging
from UFW leaders to Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante--took aim at the
governor.</TE>
<TE>   Bustamante, who usually avoids taking issue with the governor in
public, said the choice for Davis is simple: "Justice over injustice,
people over money."</TE>
<TE>   His voice rising in a thundering crescendo, Bustamante pointedly
challenged Davis: "Sign the bill that justice demands! It wouldn't
take much, just one stroke of the pen, and the burden of many
families would be lightened!"</TE>
<TE>   As the political chess game moves into its final stages, Burton,
the UFW's chief political patron in Sacramento, is threatening Davis
with political Armageddon should he veto the bill.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the fire-breathing Burton summoned reporters to the
Capitol to denounce the governor and his aides. Placing his hand on a
Bible for dramatic effect, the famously profane senator swore that
the governor had never asked him to hold back or soften the UFW bill.</TE>
<TE>   Davis aides angrily refute Burton's assertion.</TE>
<TE>   They point out that Davis stated explicitly a year ago, as he
signed a bill cracking down on growers and labor contractors who
refuse to pay farm workers, that he wouldn't consider any major farm
labor legislation until the new law had been fully implemented and
its effect assessed.</TE>
<TE>   Aides also say administration officials have repeatedly advised
UFW lobbyists and Burton staff members over the last several months
that the governor "has a problem" with any bill that grants binding
arbitration to farm workers, said Susan Kennedy, the governor's
deputy chief of staff and cabinet secretary.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everyone agrees there's a problem" with the existing law,
said Kennedy. "Getting a balanced solution on something this
monumental with the state's largest industry is going to require a
lot of work, with all the parties at the table."</TE>
<TE>   Burton and UFW leaders plan to keep the pressure on Davis in the
days ahead, playing on the symbolic potency of the farm-worker cause.</TE>
<TE>   "The UFW occupies a unique place in the Hispanic community," said
Harry Pachon, president of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute at
Claremont Graduate University. "It's been an issue that many
Hispanics throughout the state have been able to unite behind. This
is really one of these issues that's symbolic, and you can't
underestimate the power of symbolism."</TE>
<TE>   Melinda Guzman, chairman of the board of the California Hispanic
Chambers of Commerce, says a veto isn't likely to seriously damage
Davis' standing with Latinos, because of his overall record on issues
of importance to the community.</TE>
<TE>   But other experts warn that killing SB 1736 could become political
baggage that Davis carries for the rest of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the disappointment will be remembered by many Latinos, so
if the governor faces a close run in the future or runs for higher
office, it will be brought up," said Pachon.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will reinforce the image among some in the Latino
community that the governor is a very political animal, and he raises
his finger in the air to see which way the wind is blowing."</TE>
<TE>   The governor may hope to soften the disappointment of a veto on
the farm workers bill by signing another bill of importance to the
Latino community, AB 60, which would allow undocumented immigrants to
obtain driver's licenses.</TE>
<TE>   Davis aides say the governor will face criticism, regardless of
what he does. Quietly, he is trying to convince the rival camps to
sit down to find a compromise, aides say.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really tough for him because the governor is close to the
UFW," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   As the pressure mounts, Davis refuses to say what he will do.
Appearing at the state fair in Sacramento Thursday, he sidestepped
questions about his intentions, but went out of his way to pay homage
to farm workers.</TE>
<TE>   "All I want to say is that we owe a great debt of gratitude to the
farm workers in this state who put the food on our table, working
under the most difficult circumstances on the planet," Davis said.
"We all ought to say a little prayer at night to thank them for the
extraordinary, difficult work they do, day in, day out."</TE>
<TE>   For farm workers like Manuel Salomon, a prayer isn't enough.</TE>
<TE>   "If he doesn't sign it this time, we will keep pushing," said
Salomon, the Pictsweet worker, who drove six hours from Ventura to
Sacramento to join the UFW vigil outside the Capitol this past week.
"There will be more legislation and more pressure."</TE>

<KH>COLUMN ONE: THE BLACK OKIES</KH>
<HD>'I Feel Safe Here'</HD>
<DH>Tequita and Morris Jefferson returned from L.A. to their
rural roots to protect their children. But the dangers of drugs and
problems of unemployment have intruded even in remote Teviston.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK ARAX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEVISTON, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Tequita Jefferson sits down on the front porch of her
great-grandmother's house and watches her four children disappear
down a road lined with potholes and a promise.</LD>
<LD>   It is a hot summer day, 101 in the shade of a chinaberry tree, and
they are carrying fishing poles and bullfrog nets and a can of skinny
worms dug up fresh that morning.</LD>
<LD>   Peanut, the oldest, is kicking a rock, and Toryonn, the
youngest, is kicking up a cloud of dust, and Maurice, the stick man,
jousts with the air.</LD>
<TE>   Eva, the only girl, skips rope to the beat of a ditty: "Your
momma's in the kitchen cooking up rice ... and your daddy's out back
shooting dice."</TE>
<TE>   They left Southern California five years ago and moved to this
lonesome patch of farm country, where Tequita and her husband,
Morris, grew up as part of a small community of Black Okies.</TE>
<TE>   Like a handful of other young parents who were born in the alkali
and left to seek their dreams in the city, they had come back to give
their children a taste of rural life.</TE>
<TE>   The children had seen things in Los Angeles' High Desert that no
child should see. Maurice and Peanut were living with their birth
mother in Lancaster when her boyfriend took them on a hit job. They
were 5 and 6 years old at the time. He shot a man to death as they
played tag with his children.</TE>
<TE>   "He got some money and then he killed him," 11-year-old Maurice
said. "We ran."</TE>
<TE>   Back home in the San Joaquin Valley, Tequita Jefferson doesn't
worry about drive-by shootings or the color of the clothes her
children wear. She knows there are Bloods and Crips up the road in
Delano and Tulare where such things matter.</TE>
<TE>But on Road 132, where the big muddy fishing hole lies across from a
field of billy goats, the only sting worth worrying about comes from
a catfish's pucker.</TE>
<TE>   Even as she loses their shouts as they slide down the hole and
cast their lines into the silty water, she knows they will be home by
twilight.</TE>
<TE>They will be lugging a pail of jumping bullfrogs and wiggling fish.
In a day or two, like every other catch, they will hold the mass
funeral under the persimmon tree.</TE>
<TE>   "Call me a fool, but I feel safe here," Tequita says. "Palmdale
used to feel like country. Then everyone moved in and brought their
little gang wars with them. We decided to move back here to give the
boys a 50-50 chance of becoming decent men.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that doesn't sound like much. Maybe I should say 90-10 or
80-20. But they've got learning problems and their father is an
ex-con trying to deal with a drug addiction. If you add it all up,
50-50 sounds pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   She considers her husband's three children her own, and she works
hard at keeping the family intact, knowing their chances would be
slimmer in a broken home.</TE>
<TE>   But the Teviston they returned to isn't the Teviston they left
behind as teenagers. That reality hit home when they discovered a
crack house in the field out back.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they believe enough of the old country can be found here to
make their lives whole.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Morris has no steady job and neither does Tequita, a
physical therapy technician. If nothing else, the welfare check
stretches much further here.</TE>
<TE>   "After everything I've been through, I need this place," Morris
says. "It's off the map, forgotten, and that's just the way I want
it."</TE>
<TE>   Their wooden house, an old brothel, was moved here by Tequita's
great-grandparents, cotton pickers from Texas. They plopped it down
on some concrete blocks, and now the blocks have sunk in the soil.</TE>
<TE>   The house sits crooked and the window panes fall from their
frames. Saran Wrap keeps out the wind.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the place hasn't looked this good in years. They
put in new carpet and prune the fruit trees so that green shoots
replace mossy limbs. Tequita has plans to do more.</TE>
<TE>   "A garden over there and some chickens and pigs and a cow over
there. I won't call them 'big plans' because that might hex them. But
I'll call them 'reasonable plans.' "</TE>
<TE>   First on the list is building a fence to keep the puppies from
getting into trouble.</TE>
<TE>   On a warm winter morning, she gets the children out of bed early
and explains the family custom of "Cranstons." This is her word for a
breed of people who can fix things with the barest of supplies and
tools. They have a post hole digger, chicken wire, nails and no
shortage of salvageable wood.</TE>
<TE>   They dig, fill, saw and hammer. When it comes time to test the
fence, 6-year-old Toryonn carries over the two tiny pit bulls by the
scruffs of their necks. He sets down the first puppy with a gentle
hand but drops the second one from several feet in the air.</TE>
<TE>   It sits frozen in the dust, whimpering.</TE>
<TE>   "Come on little guy," 8-year-old Eva cries. "You can do it. Walk,
walk."</TE>
<TE>   The puppy seems too afraid to try. "Go get a piece of meat in the
house and let's see if we can coax him to walk," Tequita says.</TE>
<TE>   She understands the puppy's hesitation more than her
children know. She had been born with an affliction that caused her
legs to bow so badly that she nearly walked on her ankles. Playmates
called her Magilla Gorilla. She had six major surgeries as a child
and still walks with a bad totter.</TE>
<TE>   She holds out the piece of hamburger and watches the puppy limp
forward. "I don't think it's broken," she says. "He'll heal."</TE>
<TE>   The three older children have a glow in their faces and a sparkle
in their eyes, but it is a light that conceals deep problems.</TE>
<TE>   Maurice grasps only pieces of conversations, an auditory deficit
that relegates him to special education classes. Peanut and Eva have
attention disorders that Tequita is trying to fix without Ritalin.</TE>
<TE>   Their school, which covers kindergarten through eighth
grade, is so overwhelmed with the language problems of students from
Mexico that the needs of a handful of black students get lost.</TE>
<TE>   Stressing an Education</TE>
<TE>   Tequita decides to enroll them in a nearby school district where
the teachers do more one-on-one instruction.</TE>
<TE>   "Peanut is a great athlete and he keeps talking how he's going to
be pro this and pro that," Tequita says.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to discourage his dreams, but I tell him that pro
sports is a one-in-a-million. 'You've got to get a good education."'</TE>
<TE>   She knows her words ring hollow as long as she and Morris get by
on welfare. She applies for a job as a data processor at the IRS and
fixes the hair of neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   She says she has lived around enough welfare families to know that
the guilt of poverty causes them to spoil their children.</TE>
<TE>   There will be no $125 Air Jordans under their Christmas tree. They
will get a pair of no-name $15 sneakers from Kmart. "I told them
guilt does not live in my house. I'm not going to try and buy you
off. I don't play that game."</TE>
<TE>   It is hard living in this farm belt counting every nickel, but she
watches in amazement as the children explore their world with nothing
more than a few sticks, boards and wheel rims from cars. They have
discovered a creativity, a freedom, that the city had stifled.</TE>
<TE>   Their father has had a harder time making the transition. The slow
pace of country life doesn't suit him. He begins smoking crack again
and lands in a 60-day program at the local prison. Tequita considers
it a temporary setback.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this saying that black women have: 'As soon as you get
rid of your man, he turns the corner. He becomes the man you always
knew he could be," ' she says. "If I throw Morris out now, I'll never
see it."</TE>
<TE>   After his release, he gets a job mixing concrete two hours from
home. The commute is a grind, but he clears almost $2,000 a month.</TE>
<TE>   None of it goes for crack, but now Tequita confronts another
problem. Morris has strayed with "a young thing named Rochelle," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   Tequita doubts whether her plans for pigs and cows and a big
garden will ever materialize.</TE>
<TE>   She packs her bags and leaves. Five days later, she returns--for
the sake of the children and just in time for Peanut's big football
game.</TE>
<TE>   His Pop Warner team had made it to the Tulare city championships.</TE>
<TE>   It is a foggy night and the mist turns the field slippery, but
that doesn't stop Peanut from making six tackles and an interception.</TE>
<TE>   The whole family sits in the bleachers surrounded by Portuguese
dairy farmers. Tequita wins the award for the loudest parent but
loses the raffle's grand prize: a Holstein cow.</TE>
<TE>   Peanut's team gets trounced, 34-6, and Morris runs out on the
field and gives him a big hug. "I'm proud of you, son."</TE>
<TE>   They drive back to Teviston in the fog not knowing where they are
headed.</TE>
<TE>   The vineyard takes them to the almond orchard and the
almond orchard takes them to the fishing hole and the fishing hole
takes them to the small wood house with missing windows.</TE>
<TE>   It is a home with children now where persimmons line the kitchen
waiting to be turned into Christmas cookies.</TE>

<HD>Rough Winter Ahead--Really, Farmers' Almanac Predicts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LEWISTON, Maine - If last winter's mild weather kept your snow shovel
buried beneath beach towels and tanning butter, the Farmers' Almanac
recommends dusting it off this fall. Folks from Maine to Colorado can
expect heavy snow and lower-than-normal temperatures, according to
this year's edition. "We are predicting a rough winter, with severe
weather patterns that gradually shift eastward as the winter
progresses," writes Caleb Weatherbee, the pseudonym used by the
almanac's forecaster. The 186-year-old almanac, which goes on sale
Tuesday, made similar predictions last winter.Those predictions,
based on a model known to only two people that takes into account
sunspot activity, planet position and effects of the moon, were
mostly wrong. It forecast several feet of snow last year for New
England, but the region had higher-than-normal temperatures-the
toastiest winter ever recorded in Portland, Maine, and Burlington,
Vt.-and a dearth of snow. Editors insist the almanac's winter
forecast has historically been accurate 75% to 80% of the time, even
though most meteorologists say the weather cannot be predicted so far
in advance.</LD>

<HD>Man Named in Anthrax Probe Blasts Ashcroft</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Steven J. Hatfill has lodged complaints of
harassment. 'My life is being destroyed,' he says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Biowarfare expert Steven J. Hatfill stepped up his efforts Sunday to
clear his name, announcing that he has offered to provide blood and
handwriting samples to the FBI and blasting Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft
for calling him a "person of interest" in the government's
investigation of last fall's anthrax attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to look my fellow Americans directly in the eye and
declare to them: I am not the anthrax killer," Hatfill said at a news
conference outside his lawyer's office in nearby Alexandria, Va.</LD>
<LD>   The 48-year-old former Army virology researcher also said he had
filed a series of complaints against the government, charging that
federal agents were violating his privacy, continuing to follow and
harass him, and "ruining" his life.</LD>
<TE>   But Hatfill was most angry at Ashcroft. He accused the attorney
general, a deeply religious Christian, of breaking the 9th
Commandment--"Thou shalt not bear false witness"--by saying last week
that, while the government had not identified an anthrax suspect,
Hatfill remained a "person of interest to the Justice Department."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department spokesman Mark Corallo said the agency would
not respond to Hatfill's "personal" attack on Ashcroft.</TE>
<TE>   "The investigation is ongoing and we cannot comment further,"
Corallo said.</TE>
<TE>   Five people died and 13 more became ill after a series of letters
tainted with anthrax were mailed last fall to business and government
addresses on the East Coast--including in New York, Washington and
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law enforcement sources have said that between 20 and 30
people are considered possible suspects. But Hatfill's name has been
mentioned most often in the media.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the interest in Hatfill stemmed from disclosures that he
was writing a novel about bioterrorism, and that as part of his
research he, like many of his former co-workers at the Army Medical
Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Ft. Detrick, Md., had
been inoculated against anthrax.</TE>
<TE>   But at a news conference two weeks ago, Hatfill said his last
inoculation was in 1999 and that he is again susceptible to the
bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   He also said Sunday that agents since January have intensified
their investigation--including searching his home and car--and that
he had taken a polygraph test. "I was told I passed, and the examiner
was satisfied that I had told the truth," said Hatfill, whose current
employer, Louisiana State University, has put him on leave.</TE>
<TE>   To clear his name, he said, he has offered to provide blood and
handwriting samples to the FBI in the hope that they will show he is
not the anthrax killer. He said the FBI had agreed to the blood
samples, which would measure the level of anthrax antibodies in his
blood; a recent exposure would cause a high antibody level, he
indicated. He did not say whether the FBI had agreed to the
handwriting analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Once the studies are complete, Hatfill said, the government should
announce that the samples do not match what is known about the
killer. That, he said, will show that "I had absolutely nothing to do
with this terrible crime."</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill and his lawyer, Victor M. Glasberg, also released copies
of six letters sent over the last few weeks, including complaints
filed with the Justice Department and with the FBI's Office of
Professional Responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   One, dated Aug. 13, complained that two searches of Hatfill's
house "immediately turned into live media events" and asked for an
investigation into how information about him was leaked to the media.
For example, the disclosure about his novel could have come only from
the FBI, his lawyer has said, because the manuscript was on his
computer's hard drive, which the FBI seized and examined.</TE>
<TE>   A second complaint filed Wednesday with the Office of Professional
Responsibility specifically named Ashcroft and said that the attorney
general's "public dogging" of Hatfill was unethical. Ashcroft "does
not have the right ... to preside over the public shredding" of
Hatfill's life, the complaint said.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill also recalled Sunday how Ashcroft was vilified by some of
his political opponents during his confirmation hearings last year,
and said that the attorney general should realize how people's lives
and reputations can be tarnished.</TE>
<TE>   "My life," Hatfill said, "is being destroyed by arrogant
government bureaucrats. I have never met Mr. Ashcroft. I don't know
him. I've never spoken with him. And I do not understand his
personalized focus on me."</TE>

<HD>Bostonians Get First Look Inside 'Big Dig'</HD>
<DH>Tunnel: The $14.6-billion project is intended to relieve
congestion and reconnect downtown and the harbor. A sneak preview
draws crowds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD></LD>
<TE>   BOSTON - Officials opened a window into Boston's underbelly
Sunday, allowing hundreds of thousands of people to stroll along a
segment of the underground tunnel dubbed the "Big Dig." Visitors said
they couldn't miss the opportunity to get their feet on a stretch of
history in the making. "I just say to myself, 'Gee, what if I could
have told my grandchildren I could have walked on the Brooklyn Bridge
just as it was being built?' " said Richard Brody, 49, who descended
a cavernous entryway called Glory Hole 52 with his 8-year-old son
"You have a historical perspective." The tour had the ambience of a
summer festival, as a massive line of visitors snaked past a jazz
band, between pylons festooned with balloons and volunteers hawking
commemorative mugs. The endeavor, officially known as the Central
Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel Project, will sink two miles of Interstate
93 beneath the city at a cost of about $14.6 billion. Intended to
relieve congestion on Boston's urban corridor, the project will tear
down the existing elevated highway, open up valuable downtown
property and reconnect Boston's waterfront with its downtown. "The
green monster separated the city, and now we're going to put the city
back together again," said Mayor Thomas M. Menino, referring to the
seaweed-green highway that once was Boston's most prominent eyesore.
"They've really performed a miracle." The northbound tunnel open for
Sunday's tour is scheduled to open to traffic in December, while
southbound lanes are to be completed in December 2003. The project is
expected to be completed in late 2004 or early 2005. Big Dig's
official Web site calls it "the largest, most complex and
technologically challenging highway project ever attempted in
American history." But the tunnel project has its skeptics. David
Guterman, who hoisted his 8-year-old daughter onto his shoulders for
a view over the crowd, said he was impressed but doubted the new
expressway would solve traffic congestion problems. "I don't know if
they'll have any more room for cars than they did before," he said.</TE>

<LD>   A new book written by former Florida Secretary of State Katherine
Harris suggests Al Gore's aggressive legal tactics might have spoiled
his chance for a statewide recount in the contested 2000 presidential
election.</LD>
<TE>   In "Center of the Storm," scheduled to be published in October,
Harris writes that Gore unleashed "the dogs of war" in his legal
battle over Florida's electoral votes with eventual winner George W.
Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Gore won a ruling from the Florida Supreme Court forcing Harris to
delay certification of the state's election results from Nov. 17 to
Nov. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Harris contends that pushing back the deadline didn't leave Gore
enough time to start the process for a statewide recount by
officially contesting the results.</TE>

<LD>   A man who has spent more than 17 years in prison for murder should
go free based on new DNA evidence, an attorney with the Innocence

<TE>   Eddie Joe Lloyd was convicted in 1985 of raping and murdering
16-year-old Michelle Jackson based on a confession police obtained
while he was in a mental hospital and on medication.</TE>
<TE>   But recent DNA tests show he didn't commit the crime, said Barry
Scheck, an attorney who co-founded the Innocence Project, which seeks
to use DNA evidence to exonerate innocent inmates. A hearing was

welfare agency to lift regulations preventing it from going public
with about missing children.</LD>
<TE>   The Department of Children &amp; Families contends that existing law,
intended to protect privacy, keeps it from seeking the public's help
when children run away or are abducted by relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Many state representatives agree, and want to change the law on
the grounds children's welfare outweighs privacy considerations.</TE>

<HD>Health Concerns Tinge Use of Cosmetic Lenses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>All 15-year-old Robyn Rouse wanted when she bought a pair of tinted
contacts at a Cleveland video store last year was to change her dark
eyes to green to match an outfit for the night.</LD>
<LD>   The cosmetic lenses, one of thousands of pairs sold on the black
market to fashion-conscious teenagers and preteens, nearly left her
blind in one eye. Even after a cornea transplant, her doctor says it
is too soon to say whether she will recover fully.</LD>
<LD>   On the Internet, at flea markets, in beauty parlors and beach-side
kiosks, just about anyone who knows where to look--and who is unaware
or unafraid of the risks--can accessorize their eyes to match their
mood or their shirt, even mimic the look of a wild animal. The soft
lenses come in colors ranging from a basic baby blue to Liz Taylor
lilac.</LD>
<TE>   Doctors and public health officials say they are alarmed by the
increasing incidence of medical complications caused by contacts
designed not to correct eyesight, but simply to change eye color.
Although sales are supposed to be made by licensed vendors to buyers
holding a valid prescription, many clearly are not.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned that the trend is putting local teens at risk, Los
Angeles County supervisors voted in July to step up efforts by the
county's consumer affairs and health departments to warn parents and
teens of potential dangers of buying contacts off the street instead
of by prescription. Similar efforts are underway from coast to coast.</TE>
<TE>   But soon, it may become even easier--and perfectly legal--to
bypass health professionals and purchase cosmetic contacts over the
counter.</TE>
<TE>   According to people familiar with the matter, the Food and Drug
Administration's general counsel, Daniel E. Troy, sent a letter to
the director of the agency's Center for Devices and Radiological
Health, Dr. David Feigel, this month, signaling interest in
deregulating cosmetic contact lenses.</TE>
<TE>   A decision on whether to shift tinted lenses, now regulated as
medical devices, to a category of goods that includes eye shadow,
hair dye and thigh cream could come as soon as today, sources said.
The FDA exercises far broader oversight of medical devices than it
does of cosmetics.</TE>
<TE>   That the FDA might be considering such a move has disturbed some
lawmakers and doctors, who say they already are struggling to provide
the public with adequate information about the risks of wearing
something in an eye without guidance from medical professionals.</TE>
<TE>   The apparent behind-the-scenes push for looser restrictions is
prompting criticism from doctors who have treated patients, many of
them young people, for eye infections and injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Gail Royal, a Myrtle Beach, S.C., ophthalmologist who dealt
this summer with a rash of problems caused by contact lenses
purchased from unregulated sources, said any move to relax
regulations would be "extremely foolish."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a physical device placed in an eye. It rubs on the
cornea, and it can reduce the oxygen reaching the eye," Royal said.
"The repercussions of this are huge. When you let someone think it is
an inconsequential novelty, then they treat it with no respect."</TE>
<TE>   The potential market for cosmetic contacts is massive. According
to eye-care industry estimates, more than 14 million Americans would
be interested in changing their eye color.</TE>
<TE>   FDA spokeswoman Sharon Snyder said late last week that she was not
familiar with any discussion of changes in policy. She said the
general counsel's office, as a matter of policy, does not speak to
reporters about pending matters.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can tell you is that the policy right now is that these are
prescription devices necessary for eye-care professionals to
oversee," she said. "If a dispenser sells a contact lens without
receiving a valid prescription, it is a violation of the prescription
use law."</TE>
<TE>   A public calendar of FDA activities lists a June 10 meeting
between the agency's chief counsel, Troy, and representatives of
Fashion Wear Services Ltd., a British-based company that exclusively
sells cosmetic contact lenses.</TE>
<TE>   The contact lens maker has threatened to sue the FDA over the
existing policy, officials familiar with the matter said.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Hyman, a Washington-based attorney who represents Fashion
Wear Services, said he was "not at liberty" to discuss his client's
case. He said the firm was still waiting to hear from the FDA on the
matter, although he had been promised a response "weeks ago."</TE>
<TE>   Other contact lens makers, including some leaders in the U.S.
market, said they support the current regulations, and were unaware
of a push to make cosmetic lenses available without a prescription.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Cancel, a spokeswoman for Atlanta-based CIBA Vision, said
her company has been sending "cease and desist" letters to any vendor
it discovers selling lenses without prescriptions.</TE>
<TE>   Lenses sold without prescriptions appear to come from a variety of
sources. Some are major-label cosmetic contacts stolen from doctors'
offices. Some are sold from Internet sites that illegally promise "no
prescription needed." Some are unlabeled, and probably foreign-made.
Doctors say the latter group is especially worrisome because it is
impossible to know what, if any, quality controls were used in their
manufacture.</TE>
<TE>   Contacts that do not correct vision--known in the industry as
"zero power" or "plano" lenses--carry the same risks as contacts that
help people see better, medical experts warn.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns about the possible policy change have prompted Rep. Henry
A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) to urge Health and Human Services Secretary
Tommy G. Thompson "to intervene personally and stop what is a legally
unsound and medically dangerous policy."</TE>
<TE>   Waxman, in a letter dated today, warned that such a shift "would
also establish a precedent that could lead to the deregulation of
many more potentially hazardous prescription drugs and devices."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Thomas Steinemann, an ophthalmologist and director of the Eye
Clinic at Metro Health Medical Center Cleveland, said his experiences
treating teenage girls have only strengthened his belief that people
who purchase any kind of contact lenses should first visit a vision
care professional.</TE>
<TE>   "A contact lens that just changes the color of your eye still has
all the risk factors associated with corrective lenses," Steinemann
said. "Soft contact lenses disrupt the normal physiology of the eye.
They interfere with oxygen flow. They disrupt the eye's surface, and
they also act as a reservoir for bacteria."</TE>
<TE>   Contacts require proper care and storage to reduce the likelihood
of eye infections, doctors say. A major concern arising from the
eye-color-changing fad is the reportedly common practice of teens
swapping lenses with friends, an activity experts liken to sharing
toothbrushes. When teens share contacts, they also share body fluids,
increasing the odds of a variety of infections, the experts warn.</TE>
<TE>   Medical professionals also note that even if someone has normal
vision, shapes and sizes of eyeballs differ, requiring contacts to be
fitted to the eye. That alone, they argue, makes over-the-counter
sales too risky to be allowed. Steinemann said he recently treated
two teenage girls who wore black-market contacts that were too tight
for their eyes, causing them severe pain.</TE>
<TE>   For Robyn Rouse, the memory of how close she came to losing her
eyesight remains vivid.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of putting in the lenses she bought off the shelf of
the video store, she was in agony, her eyes running, sunlight
unbearable.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, her frightened mother took her to an emergency room,
where she was diagnosed with a serious bacterial infection.</TE>
<TE>   For four days and four sleepless nights, nurses administered
eyedrops every 30 minutes to save her eyesight. This year, the
teenager underwent a cornea transplant to fix scarring caused by the
infection. It will be several months before her doctors can pronounce
her out of danger.</TE>
<TE>   Now she warns others at her high school about what happened to
her. But she says the message has fallen on deaf ears for all but her
closest friends.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people I go to school with still wear them. It'd be like
they just wear them to put them in to match their clothes," she said.
"They're like me before this happened. I didn't think they'd mess me
up."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer David Willman contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Second Body Unearthed in Oregon Yard</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO and STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>OREGON CITY, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Authorities on Sunday found a second set of human remains here in the
backyard of an ex-convict during an inch-by-inch search of the
property. They also identified a body found earlier as that of
Miranda Gaddis, a 13-year-old who had been missing since March.</LD>
<LD>   An autopsy on the second set of remains--which had been stuffed
into a barrel and buried under a concrete slab--is expected to be
completed today. But the hundreds of mourners who stood vigil outside
the unkempt property Sunday had little doubt what the medical report
would show.</LD>
<LD>   They fully expect the second body to be identified as that of
12-year-old Ashley Pond, a friend of Miranda's from the Gardiner
Middle School dance team. She has been missing since January.</LD>
<TE>   Friends and neighbors of the girls--and many strangers--crowded in
along with a crush of reporters to listen to Oregon City Police Chief
Gordon Huiras and Charles Mathews, the agent in charge of the FBI's
Oregon office, make the grim announcements. Teens sat cross-legged in
front of the microphones, wiping at their eyes as they awkwardly
rubbed at tears that would not stop.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone's got to help me up. I'm shaking," one woman cried,
pushing free of the crowd as officials waved off reporters asking
about the condition of the remains.</TE>
<TE>   "That somebody could do this to someone is wrong and gross and
sick," sobbed Kayla Urbach, a lanky 14-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   The bodies were found at the 1,200-square-foot rented house of
Ward Weaver, 39, a toolmaker with a history of violence against
women.</TE>
<TE>   The home, sitting on an acre of sun-scorched yellow grass, is at
the entrance of the apartment complex where Ashley and Miranda lived.
Both girls disappeared last winter after breakfast, never making it
to school.</TE>
<TE>   Many here said the twin disappearances brought together the
community in this working-class suburb 20 minutes south of Portland.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, this is a very sad conclusion to this investigation,"
Mathews said. "On the other hand, I think the case has been
resolved."</TE>
<TE>   Weaver has not been charged in connection with the girls' deaths.</TE>
<TE>   He has been jailed on unrelated charges since Aug. 13, when his
son's teenage girlfriend ran naked from his house, screaming that he
had raped and tried to smother her.</TE>
<TE>   That night, Weaver's son called 911 to report that Weaver had
claimed that he had killed Ashley and Miranda.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the son's call, Weaver had been of interest to police
and the girls' relatives because of his criminal history--and his
close ties to Ashley. As a friend of Weaver's daughter, Ashley spent
many nights at their house. Last summer, she told her mother Weaver
had molested her, but no charges were filed.</TE>
<TE>   But his name continued to crop up throughout the nationwide hunt
for the girls. Authorities searched his home and car months ago,
finding nothing.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Weaver did nothing to hide. In fact, he talked often
with the media about the case, at times sounding close to boastful
about suspicion cast his way. Weaver told one interviewer months ago
that he was a "prime suspect"; he also volunteered that he had failed
a polygraph test.</TE>
<TE>   He even told Associated Press that his sister had warned him to
"watch myself" around Ashley, apparently because she sometimes wore
revealing clothes. "I said, 'Shut up, she's 12,' " Weaver recounted.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver spent three years behind bars in California for bashing his
son's baby-sitter with a chunk of concrete. Both of his former wives
have filed restraining orders against him.</TE>
<TE>   In his interviews, Weaver emphasized that he treated Ashley as a
daughter: buying her clothes, driving her to school when she missed
the bus and even taking her on a family vacation to California last
summer.</TE>
<TE>   One of their stops, he said, was at San Quentin Prison--where his
father is on death row for murdering a young woman and burying her
body in his backyard.</TE>
<TE>   The father, Ward Francis Weaver Jr., was convicted two decades ago
of raping and murdering a 23-year-old woman and killing her
boyfriend. The woman's body was found buried beneath a concrete pad
outside his Northern California home.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Weaver's son Rodney was there when authorities dug up
the body at the Oroville home in July 1982.</TE>
<TE>   So when he heard that his stepbrother Ward had poured a concrete
pad in his Oregon City backyard not long after two local girls
disappeared, Rodney Weaver was shaken.</TE>
<TE>   "That blew me away," he told the Oregonian newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "If he did it," Rodney Weaver told the paper last week, "that's
where they'd be."</TE>
<TE>   The fresh concrete--Ward Weaver said it was a pad for a hot
tub--drew the attention of the girls' relatives too.</TE>
<TE>   After Weaver was jailed on the unrelated rape charge, Ashley's
stepmother went into his backyard and taped a sign on the slab
reading: "Dig Me Up."</TE>
<TE>   In the haze of a wrenching Sunday, the FBI did just that.</TE>
<TE>   In front of Weaver's house, against a chain-link fence, teddy
bears and flowers bloomed into a ragtag memorial. Out back, dozens of
FBI agents with shovels and picks broke through the concrete and
started digging.</TE>
<TE>   In front, teenage girls in pastel tank tops huddled, crying. Sport
utility vehicles with canoes strapped to the roofs crept along at a
gawker's pace.</TE>
<TE>   Out back, FBI agents sifted through three barrels that were found
under the slab. Two were filled with dirt and gravel. The third held
human remains, and agents set up a gurney.</TE>
<TE>   In front of the home, a woman sat on a lawn chair, breastfeeding
her infant, waiting for news.</TE>
<TE>   Melissa Snider, passing by with her 15-month-old son, at first
refused to think ill of Weaver. She knew him from a job at an auto
supply store. She was friends with one of his old girlfriends. She
used to baby-sit his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very good with his daughter," she said. "When I heard that
he might have been involved, I was totally stunned."</TE>
<TE>   Then the police chief held the news conference, and Snider
remained quiet as her fiance ran back and forth from the media crush
to give her updates.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sick to my stomach," she said, staring at Weaver's house. "He
needs to fry."</TE>
<TE>   Calvo reported from Oregon City and Simon from St. Louis.</TE>

<HD>Ventura's Party Must Show Minnesota It's Ready to Rumble</HD>

<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>The underlying theory of the Minnesota State Fair appears to be that
anything edible will be improved if it is deep-fried, or impaled on a
stick or, preferably, both.</LD>
<LD>   Other states may settle for corn on a stick, or corn dogs on a
stick, or even pork on a stick. But along the broad carnival midways
here, you can find not only all that but also deep-fried pickles,
deep-fried alligator and deep-fried macaroni and cheese--all jabbed
on a stick. Not to mention Snickers and Milky Way bars deep-fried in
doughnut batter, hoisted on a stick and then rolled in powdered sugar
because, apparently, a doughnut-coated candy bar isn't quite sweet
enough on its own.</LD>
<LD>   This astonishing culinary excess doesn't do anything good for the
state's collective cholesterol level, but it does suggest that
Minnesota isn't quite as you-betcha bland as it sometimes looks from
the outside. Its politics send the same message. This is the only
state, after all, that recently elected as its governor a former
professional wrestler. And now with Jesse Ventura stepping down after
a tumultuous term, the state could make history again in choosing his
successor.</LD>
<TE>   Ventura's 1998 victory as a third-party candidate was a shock, but
not unprecedented. Charismatic independent and third-party candidates
have periodically stormed past the two major political parties and
won governorships. But they have almost never been able to
institutionalize their success and create a viable party that could
compete after they stepped aside.</TE>
<TE>   This fall's election will test whether Ventura's Independence
Party can break that precedent and emerge as a durable alternative to
the two major parties here, or is doomed to also drift toward
irrelevance--a prospect with daunting implications for fledgling
third-party efforts in other states.</TE>
<TE>   "The question for third parties is: Do we get these charismatic
individuals periodically who really are the engine that pulls the
train, and then when they disappear from the scene, no one else can
sustain it?" says Micah Sifry, author of a new history of independent
party movements, "Spoiling for a Fight."</TE>
<TE>   The last two governors elected as independents before Ventura left
nothing behind. Lowell Weicker won the Connecticut governorship in
1990, but his lieutenant governor finished a weak third in the race
to succeed him and his third party soon vanished. Independent Maine
Gov. Angus King, forced by a two-term limit to step down this year,
didn't even endorse a potential successor.</TE>
<TE>   Since World War I, a state has voted only once to succeed one
third-party governor with another from the same party. That was in
Minnesota, when Floyd Olson, the leader of the left-leaning
Farmer-Labor Party, served three terms during the Depression, and
Elmer Benson held the seat in 1936 after Olson died.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Independence Party has a chance to repeat that distant
history. Early polls show its gubernatorial nominee, Tim Penny,
running even with Democrat Roger Moe and Republican Tim Pawlenty, the
majority leaders in the state Senate and House, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Penny, a former Democrat who served in the U.S. House and advised
Ventura, fits the same ideological pattern as Ventura: He's fiscally
conservative but moderate on social issues (he renounced his earlier
support for banning abortion). Stylistically though, the button-down
Penny is to Ventura as college wrestling is to World Wrestling
Entertainment: He's serious, earnest and a bit dry. There's little
chance Penny will electrify younger voters and blue-collar workers
the way Ventura did while surging to victory in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   But a few hours with Penny at the state fair makes clear he has
his own sober appeal to what he calls "the sensible center." When he
appears, a middle-age crowd forms almost immediately--and stays,
waiting patiently to ask detailed questions. Keeping with the fair's
motif, his supporters hand out propaganda-on-a-stick hand fans with
Penny's slogans. "Thank you very much for running," Robert Rasmussen,
a local teacher, tells him. "It gives us moderates someone to vote
for."</TE>
<TE>   Penny's campaign is so crucial for the Independence Party because
it made so little progress at building on Ventura's initial
popularity. The party is still more of an idea than an institution.
It doesn't have an office or a full-time staff. Nor has it elected a
single senator or representative to the state Legislature (though one
state senator joined while in office). That's largely because Ventura
had little interest in fund-raising or recruiting. "Gov. Ventura has
done some things to help the party," says Jack Uldrich, the former
party chairman now managing Penny's campaign. "But he never saw
party-building as one of his jobs."</TE>
<TE>   The contrast with the Farmer-Labor Party, founded in the 1920s, is
telling. Olson was an energetic organizer, and at the party's peak in
1936 it controlled not only the governorship but majorities of the
state House of Representatives and the state's congressional
delegation. Eventually, local Democrats sued for peace in a merger
arranged by a young Hubert H. Humphrey, which is why Democrats here
still run under the banner of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.</TE>
<TE>   Even at the peak of his popularity--which has now faded amid
emotional outbursts and a wearying war over the state
budget--Ventura, a true product of the media age, didn't recognize
the value of building such a party around him. That hurt Ventura's
own cause because he never elected legislators who might fight for
his ideas. But it has hurt the Independence Party more by leaving it
with so little to show for Ventura's stormy tenure.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura seems genuinely interested in helping Penny. The two men
appeared together Friday at the fair; Ventura, chomping on a huge
unlighted cigar and looking oddly like Penny's bodyguard, told
admirers: "It's time to move on; now it's Tim's turn." But to secure
their future, Independence Party leaders recognize they will also
have to elect some of the nearly 60 state House candidates they are
fielding this year--and that's a tougher challenge. Only a handful
are considered viable.</TE>
<TE>   The risk is failure begetting failure: If the party can't win some
elections now, it will have more trouble recruiting viable candidates
in 2004, especially if Penny doesn't hold the governorship.This
fall's results will determine whether the Ventura era here was like
the fair itself--loud, boisterous and brief--or something more
lasting.</TE>

<HD>At the Pentagon, 'Not Just an Assignment'</HD>
<DH>Sept. 11: Martha Carden's unit, hit by the plane, was
something special in a bureaucracy of 24,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Va.</DL>
<LD>Martha Carden is the sort of no-nonsense, been-there-forever sort
whom co-workers call the institutional memory of the office. But
today, when she walks into her gleaming new digs down the hall from
the Pentagon office she escaped Sept. 11, she will be the only
memory.</LD>
<LD>   Gone are 24 of her colleagues, mostly younger than she, who used
to devour the cookies she baked, risk their cash in her football pool
and earnestly pull den mother Martha aside for help navigating the
bewildering Pentagon bureaucracy she understood so well.</LD>
<LD>   Of all the people who came to work Sept. 11 at the office called
DCSPER, the acronym for the Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel,
only Carden made it out.</LD>
<TE>   "My emotion today is anger," Carden said Friday as she began her
move into the rebuilt offices. She's a tiny woman of 53 whose silver
hair and demure business suits belie the grit that has made her a
survivor of 30 years in the Army bureaucracy and one hellish morning
of smoke and flames.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so angry that those cowards killed my co-workers for the
simple reason that they were Americans. My friends had lives, and
together we had a life in that office that we had made. At the time
it seemed normal, everyday. We didn't appreciate how special it was
until it was gone."</TE>
<TE>   The obliteration of DCSPER by the terrorist-flown airliner that
ripped directly into it did more than kill those two dozen people. It
decimated in one instant a place where a small coterie of ordinary
people, living ordinary lives, together added up to something
extraordinary.</TE>
<TE>   Carden, pulled to safety by an Army officer, was not seriously
injured in the attack. She was back at work soon in temporary offices
in Alexandria--a return to a job whose importance kept her going.</TE>
<TE>   As Carden moves back in to an office just steps away from where
her friends perished--when the plane hit, she was in a conference
room about 20 yards away--she is deeply aware that what she had in
her old office is gone forever. Even its name is gone, replaced by
the even more anonymous-sounding G-1.</TE>
<TE>   "We were like a family, a team," said Cheryl Barron, a secretary
in the office who was in Florida mourning her mother's death when the
plane hit. Two more co-workers from the office were out of the
building on assignment that day.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all concerned with each other. We talked about our
families, our problems. It wasn't just a job, a drudgery, not to us
it wasn't. It was a place where good people came together."</TE>
<TE>   Not an Ordinary Cog</TE>
<TE>   In an organization as big as the Pentagon--24,000 people work in
the massive edifice alone and many thousands more in Pentagon offices
in nearby cities--it is easy to view a single office as just an
anonymous cog in a vast bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   But as cogs go, DCSPER, or "Desper" as it was pronounced, was a
pretty big one.</TE>
<TE>   The job of the office--whose boss, Lt. Gen. Timothy J. Maude, was
the highest-ranking casualty of the attack--was to parcel out the
work assigned to every unit of the Army by its military leader, the
chief of staff.</TE>
<TE>   It was a job that Carden, who had been at it for more than a
decade, took exceedingly seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "When new people would come into the office, I would sit them down
and tell them, 'You've got to realize where you are,' " Carden said.
"You are not just pushing papers. You are almost at the top of the
Army. You must ever, ever be mindful of where you are. What you are
doing is helping the soldiers in the field get the work they need to
do. This is not just an assignment."</TE>
<TE>   In the larger world of the military, where soldiers live arduous
lives training and fighting in the field, the Pentagon has
traditionally been derided as a world of pencil pushers. But in
offices like DCSPER, there is another breed--of people, military and
civilian alike, who view the Pentagon as a sailor does his ship, and
who are fiercely loyal to its mission.</TE>
<TE>   The office, by the account of Carden and others who had some
connection to it, represented the epitome of Pentagon culture.</TE>
<TE>   It was the kind of place where most people worked 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.
on their own initiative, even though they were paid for an eight-hour
shift. It was a place where to be called a dedicated civil servant
was to be paid the highest of compliments, and where women were
called ma'am but were expected to be as blunt, matter-of-fact and
respected as any of their male colleagues. It was, above all, a place
where people were esteemed for their ability to adhere to the
process, to collaborate, to get along.</TE>
<TE>   "The first five rules in this building are coordinate, coordinate,
coordinate, coordinate and coordinate," Carden told young soldiers
newly assigned to the office.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're trying to get a decision made, you can't just think
about your own little unit, like you could at Ft. Hood. Here you are
making decisions that will affect the entire force. In this building,
this is the big picture."</TE>
<TE>   In DCSPER, Carden and Maude would tease each other about their
obsession with Christmas decorations: They both agreed that no month
was the wrong month to buy a particularly special tree ornament.</TE>
<TE>   It was an office where a colleague wouldn't think twice of driving
an ill colleague home. Once, Carden got such a ride from Sgt. Maj.
Larry Strickland, who died Sept. 11. He was all concern and all
gentleman, she said, until the moment she doubled over in his car,
crying from pain. As they pulled up to a light, he looked over at
her, she recalled wryly, and asked, "Could you maybe not do that,
ma'am? I don't want people to think I'm hitting you."</TE>
<TE>   When DCSPER moved into new offices in a renovated wing of the
Pentagon--the same offices overlooking the Pentagon helipad that
became the staff's burial ground--workers took great pride in
decorating. Carden brought in a prized piece of needlepoint she had
made to hang on the wall. Strickland hung up a gag piece he was
particularly tickled by: a plastic bass on a wooden plaque that, at
the touch of a button, would wiggle to a recording of "Take Me to the
River."</TE>
<TE>   Two other victims, Spc. Sunny Pak and Pat Statz, a civilian worker
in the office, would disappear on their breaks and come back lugging
castaway furniture from another office. Co-workers would hear the
noise of another haul coming down the corridor and announce the
arrival of "Sunny's Salvage!"</TE>
<TE>   Last Call to a Friend</TE>
<TE>   Pak was on the phone talking to a friend when the plane hit. Her
desk faced a window that lay directly in the path the plane took when
it came skidding into the building, missile-like with one wing
sheared off. According to the friend she was talking with, Pak cried
out once, then let out a long, terrifying scream. Then the phone went
dead.</TE>
<TE>   Staff Sgt. Steven Goosey, 29, had been in the office for two
years, working as a computer systems analyst, when he left for a
training course at Ft. Gordon, Ga., about two months before the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Goosey said that when he heard about the attack he felt sure
almost immediately that the people he called "my life, my work
family" were gone. When he was able to reach Carden on the phone the
night of Sept. 11, he said he broke down at the sound of her voice,
coughing, hoarse, but alive.</TE>
<TE>   Telling his commander he needed to help, Goosey left his training
to return to the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, as Carden returned to the Pentagon, Goosey was at her
side.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the only living person who could help me set up the office
and redo everything that had been destroyed," Carden said. "He knew
all those people who had been killed. He felt the only place for him
was helping me get the office going."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting at a table in the corner of a cafeteria in the rebuilt
Pentagon wing--the same cafeteria Carden crawled through on all
fours, her hand tight around the belt of Lt. Col. Robert Grunewald,
the man she credits with saving her life--Carden said the people of
DCSPER live in her thoughts every day. And she could not go on
without them but for the job she believes in now more fervently than
ever.</TE>
<TE>   Like half a dozen others who worked in DCSPER, Carden, the unit's
assistant executive officer, is a civilian with close connections to
the military. A native of rural Tennessee who is married to a retired
Army colonel and has used her job to travel the world, she says she
has found a home in the pace, purpose and honesty of the military
life. She said that, like many other civilians at the Pentagon, she
is inspired by the example and dedication she sees around her. That's
what pushes her to work 12-hour days, eat at her desk, do without
breaks.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Carden was in fine form, hugging new co-workers one
moment, complaining about her desk setup and computer software the
next. Her toughness emerged when she realized the reconstructed
conference room from which she and eight others had fled the inferno
was now lacking an escape route.</TE>
<TE>   "There are nine people who owe their lives to a second door, and
[the builders] will not put in a second door," she said, literally
jumping in her frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to those guys, 'Why the heck didn't you build a second
door?' They said to me, 'Well, it meets the fire code, it meets the
fire code.' Well, it doesn't meet my own personal code. I tell you,
I've threatened to bring in an ax and position it at this wall so I'm
ready."</TE>

<HD>Adults Punished for Crimes Hits Record</HD>
<DH>Report: A federal study finds 6.6 million people are under
correctional supervision in the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD></LD>
<TE>   WASHINGTON - One in every 32 adults in the United States was
behind bars or on probation or parole by the end of last year,
according to a government report released Sunday that found a record
6.6 million people in the nation's correctional system. The number of
adults under supervision by the criminal justice system rose by
147,700, or 2.3%, between 2000 and 2001, the Justice Department
reported."The overall figures suggest that we've come to rely on the
criminal justice system as a way of responding to social problems in
a way that's unprecedented," said Marc Mauer, assistant director of
the Sentencing Project, an advocacy group that promotes alternatives
to incarceration. Almost 4 million people were on probation, 2.8%
more than in 2000, while the number of people in prison grew by 1.1%
to 1.3 million, the smallest annual increase in nearly three decades.
More than half of those on probation, 53%, had been convicted of
felonies, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics
report.Experts noted the recent trend of arrests had declined for
murder, rape and other violent crimes. Many of those on probation
were convicted of using illegal drugs or driving while intoxicated,
the report says. In addition, some states have eliminated mandatory
minimum sentences for certain crimes. California's Proposition 36,
passed in 2000, requires treatment rather than incarceration for
nonviolent drug offenders. Most of those drug users wind up on
probation. "The collection of reforms, from drug courts to treatment
in lieu of incarceration to sentence reforms like getting rid of
mandatory minimums and expanding community correction options, have
the effect of redirecting people from prison to probation," said
Nicholas Turner, director of national programs for the Vera Institute
of Justice, a nonprofit research group. Texas had more adults under
correctional supervision than any other state, 755,100. California
was second with 704,900. Texas also had the most adults on probation,
443,684, followed by California at 350,768.</TE>

<HD>Damage to Coral Reefs Mounts, Study Says</HD>
<DH>Ecology: Broad survey cites human causes such as
overfishing and pollution. Reefs are a key indicator of the health of
oceans, scientists say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Following the grim path of the rain forests and the Arctic, coral
reefs are becoming the latest victim of the modern human plagues of
pollution, over-harvesting and climate change, according to a massive
survey of these sensitive ocean gardens.</LD>
<LD>   Key species of fish, shrimp and lobster are missing from the
majority of the reefs that were studied as fishermen pour cyanide and
blast dynamite within the antler-like branches of many coral heads to
collect seafood.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, polluted runoff from coastal communities is
providing a continual stream of fertilizer onto many reefs, feeding
species of large and fleshy algae that choke off growth of the type
of hard, stony corals that make up the foundation of the reefs,
according to the study by Reef Check, a monitoring program based at
UCLA's Institute of the Environment.</LD>
<TE>   The study, involving more than 5,000 scientists and divers who
over the course of five years tracked the transformation of coral
reefs in 55 countries, found only one reef out of more than 1,100
that was judged to be in near-pristine condition.</TE>
<TE>   "Coral reefs have suffered more damage over the last 20 years than
they have in the last 1,000," said Gregor Hodgson, a visiting UCLA
professor who heads Reef Check and is the author of the report. "It
is the rate of decline and the global extent of the damage that is so
alarming, with species reasonably abundant 30 years ago now on the
verge of extinction."</TE>
<TE>   The growing destruction of these fragile yet bony ecosystems,
often called the rain forests of the oceans, has alarmed scientists
because coral reefs account for 25% of all marine fish species and
provide food for 350 million people, mostly in developing nations,
Hodgson said.</TE>
<TE>   Although reefs make up just one-tenth of 1% of the world's ocean
area, authors of the study called them a key indicator of the health
of the world's oceans.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the rocky, physical structure of reefs provides crucial
protection for many coastal regions from the severity of storms, and
their continual growth and erosion replenish the white-sand beaches
so prized in the multibillion-dollar tourist industry, often the
major source of income in poor tropical nations.</TE>
<TE>   Coral reefs are fertile breeding grounds for marine life. If it
were not for insects in rain forests, reefs would have the highest
species diversity of any habitat in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Coral reefs are more than 100 million years old and are among the
largest living structures on Earth. The Great Barrier Reef off
Australia is more than 1,200 miles long and is visible from outer
space.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest threats to the reefs are ocean temperature
spikes that many marine biologists attribute to global warming and
short-term climate phenomena such as El Nino. Corals are unusual
animals because they thrive close to the upper range of their
temperature tolerance. Upward changes of just a few degrees over a
sustained period cause the symbiotic microorganisms living within the
coral tissue, which provide energy for the colony, to either leave or
be expelled by the coral.</TE>
<TE>   Known as coral bleaching, this phenomenon has killed massive
stands of coral in recent years in the tropical Pacific Ocean,
including giant colonies that scientists believe were as much as
1,000 years old. It has made the surviving coral susceptible to a
variety of diseases. One large episode in 1997 and 1998 reduced the
world's live coral growth by 10%, according to the study.</TE>
<TE>   Overfishing is threatening to put four species of fish in danger
of extinction and is depleting many other reef fish and shellfish at
alarming rates, Hodgson said.</TE>
<TE>   Predators such as the Nassau grouper, Barramundi cod and hump-head
wrasse were missing from at least eight of every 10 reefs surveyed.</TE>
<TE>   These big fish are prized in Hong Kong and other East Asian
markets where restaurants allow customers to select a live fish from
an aquarium and have it cooked for them. This live-fish trade, where
fishermen in Indonesia and the Philippines often squirt cyanide into
the reefs to stun the fish, also can kill nearby animals and the
coral.</TE>
<TE>   Other destructive fishing techniques include throwing explosives
into the reefs to stun or kill the fish to make them easier to
harvest.</TE>
<TE>   Bump-head parrot fish, important because they crush coral with
their jaws, helping to create sand, were absent in 89% of the reefs.</TE>
<TE>   The triton--often collected for the souvenir market because of its
distinctive shell shape--and the spiny lobster also appeared scarce.
Triton harvesting is especially damaging because it is the primary
predator of the coral-gobbling crown of thorns sea star. The survey
sighted only 101 of the large shelled mollusks--harvested by the
thousands as recently as the 1960s, Hodgson said.</TE>
<TE>   Reef Check divers saw fewer numbers of some species of smaller
fish, shrimp and invertebrates that are caught live to be sold for
display in home aquariums.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Ostrander, a biologist and coral reef expert at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, cautioned that Reef Check's numbers at best
only point to areas where more research is required.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be careful with this kind of information," Ostrander
said. "Tritons, for example, are very low-density animals on the reef
and it is not surprising that they did not see a lot. While the
Nassau grouper is clearly in trouble, the ones that I see are a lot
smaller than what we would like, but I can tell you of about 50 reefs
where I work where we see the groupers."</TE>
<TE>   Hodgson said the Reef Check project is designed to be an early
warning system and that he hopes other scientists look at the issues
raised in his report and make them targets of their research.</TE>
<TE>   "Although it is a big study, we have looked at only a tiny
fraction of the world's reefs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hodgson conceded that scientists really don't have a good idea of
how a pristine reef should look or of the natural cycles of reef
life.</TE>
<TE>   "If you go back through the records of ship captains and
naturalists for hundreds of years, you find that humans have a very
long record of exporting reef organisms, sometimes in astounding
numbers," he said. "We might not have had a pristine reef for
centuries and we really don't know what the baseline should look
like."</TE>
<TE>   Ostrander said the general message that reefs are under assault is
correct.</TE>
<TE>   "We have definitely seen changes in the reefs within the last five
years," he said. "Species diversity is going down."</TE>
<TE>   Ostrander said he believes environmental factors have made coral
especially susceptible to bleaching and disease.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of us are trying to figure out what part of this is natural
and what part is the effect of humans on the ecosystem," Ostrander
said.</TE>
<TE>   The biologist said he is concerned about the discovery of problems
on remote reefs, far from human habitation.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to ask yourself what is happening here and where it will
happen next," Ostrander said. "Could it happen on land in the forests
and prairies? We just don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Not all of Reef Check's findings were grim.</TE>
<TE>   "Modern coral reefs have been around for 100 million years, and
they can be surprisingly resilient," Hodgson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Ecologists have been surprised at how quickly reef fish
populations have rebounded at successful marine parks," he added.
"Two years is enough to replenish many species. Some types of corals
also grow very quickly--like corn--but others take decades to reach a
large size."</TE>
<TE>   Reef Check scientists said the establishment of more marine parks
and restricted fishing zones internationally will help over-fished
species rebound by creating breeding refuges.</TE>
<TE>   Hodgson, Ostrander and other marine biologists said more money
needs to be invested in technology to farm reef organisms for the
food and aquarium industries.</TE>
<TE>   "The demand for reef fish and shellfish far exceeds the supply,"
Hodgson said. "Unless we can invest in the research and development
to aquaculture some of the high-value organisms in environmentally
acceptable ways, they will become extinct."</TE>

<HD>Latinos' Political Foe Gets Friendly</HD>
<DH>Profile: By backing an ethnic supermarket in Anaheim,
mayoral hopeful Curt Pringle changes stripes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Curt Pringle was a 29-year-old Republican upstart running for the
Assembly in 1988 when he did something that cast a shadow on the rest
of his political career. On election day, his campaign hired
uniformed security guards to stand outside polling stations in
heavily Latino neighborhoods, holding placards reading "Non-Citizens
Can't Vote."</LD>
<LD>   Today, Pringle is running for mayor of Anaheim. But Orange County
is a far different place both politically and demographically than it
was 14 years ago, and voters must decide whether Pringle has changed
with the times.</LD>
<LD>   Anaheim is now nearly 50% Latino. For several weeks, the hottest
issue in town has been the Planning Commission's decision to thwart
the Mexican-owned supermarket chain Gigante from moving into town
after a city official called it too Hispanic. Last week, the City
Council overturned the Planning Commission's denial of Gigante's
request.</LD>
<TE>   In a move that surprised some of his critics, Pringle came out in
support of Gigante, even appearing at a rally beside some of the very
Latino activists who blasted him for the poll guard incident.</TE>
<TE>   "This issue has united individuals and organizations with divided
viewpoints around a basic American principle of property rights and
fairness," said Pringle, who served as speaker of the Assembly during
the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   While the activists are far from endorsing Pringle, they said they
can't help but respect what they took to be an unspoken mea culpa.</TE>
<TE>   "It speaks well for him that he's here," said Amin David,
president of Los Amigos of Orange County, a leading Latino rights
group. "What happened [in 1988] brought forth a lot of pain.
Sometimes we can move on and sometimes we can't."</TE>
<TE>   Ruben Smith, who organized the Gigante rally, said Pringle's
stance marks an important first step. "I don't think it just goes
away with one issue," he said. "There's no doubt he wants to do the
right thing and change the image he has."</TE>
<TE>   Shifting Demographics</TE>
<TE>   Pringle's candidacy comes at a time of great change for the Orange
County GOP. It has seen its traditional domination of county politics
slip in recent years. In the increasingly diverse central county,
several high-profile Democrats have won office, including Rep.
Loretta Sanchez (D-Garden Grove), who defeated legendary conservative
Republican Robert K. Dornan.</TE>
<TE>   Communities long known as rock-solid Republican strongholds, such
as Anaheim, have seen a wave of immigration from Mexico and other
Latin American countries in the past decade.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP is shifting with the times.</TE>
<TE>   "Things have changed," said Fred Smoller, head of the Henley
Social Science Research Center at Chapman University in Orange.
"Clearly, the Republican Party has. Politicians look to what works,
and [targeting immigrants] failed for them."</TE>
<TE>   Smoller said the posting of guards at polling places, and even the
tough rhetoric against illegal immigration used by Gov. Pete Wilson
in his 1994 reelection, would not fly with today's Orange County
Republicans, who are trying to make inroads among Latinos. "We now
are a minority-majority county and good politicians ought to be able
to count," Smoller said.</TE>
<TE>   What became known as the "poll-guard incident" confirmed for many
Orange County's reputation as a hub of intolerance. The county's
history is pocked with divisive politics: In 1924, Anaheim was the
site of the largest white supremacist rally in California history. In
the 1950s, the extreme anti-communist John Birch Society found a home
in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Pringle's campaign, aided by the local GOP, stationed
private guards at 22 polling places in Latino neighborhoods in Santa
Ana to monitor voters. Some challenged voters and demanded
identification.</TE>
<TE>   Local GOP leaders testified later that they were responding to
fears that Democrats planned to drive busloads of illegal immigrants
to cast ballots in the central Orange County race. The local party
and Pringle eventually settled a civil rights lawsuit for $400,000.
There was no evidence of the busloads of illegitimate voters.</TE>
<TE>   Pringle, defeated for reelection to his district seat in 1990, won
a neighboring seat in 1992 and in 1996 was elected Assembly speaker.
Dismissed as an insignificant far-right ideologue during his first
stint, he rose to Assembly speaker with a reputation for
effectiveness and fairness.</TE>
<TE>   Termed out of office in 1998, Pringle ran for state treasurer that
year. Several Latino organizations ran television ads in key markets
reminding voters of the poll-guard incident, and he lost to Democrat
Phil Angelides by a wide margin.</TE>
<TE>   Pringle remains uncomfortable talking about the poll guards and
the impact the incident has had on his political career. He has
repeatedly said that he knew about the guards but didn't know they
would be in uniform or that his campaign paid for their signs. If
someone suggested hiring such guards today, he said he wouldn't agree
to it.</TE>
<TE>   "What's more important to me is that where you can find the
ability to work with people to get things done, you do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pringle said he is not changing his core political beliefs to fit
the demographics of Anaheim. Speaking publicly on behalf of Gigante
may be politically costly, he said, because several neighborhood
groups are opposed to the supermarket moving in. While Latinos make
up nearly half the city's population, they represent only one in five
registered voters.</TE>
<TE>   "There are ways to work with people who come from different
perspectives," Pringle said. "That's how I was able to be successful
in Sacramento. I like the fact we are able to find common ground."</TE>
<TE>   Pringle said his efforts on behalf of the Mexican supermarket,
standing side by side with Latino leaders, illustrate this common
ground.</TE>
<TE>   However, Latino activists said one bold stance won't erase their
memories. "People do different things at different times for
different reasons in their political career," said activist Nativo
Lopez. "Voters can judge at the ballot box."</TE>
<TE>   Other Candidates</TE>
<TE>   The other candidates for mayor are City Council members Frank
Feldhaus and Lucille Kring, and former La Habra Police Chief Steve
Stavely.</TE>
<TE>   Stavely is the only Democrat and certain to receive his party's
backing to gain the seat now held by Democrat Tom Daly.</TE>
<TE>   The mayoralty, a part-time post that pays $18,000 a year, is
considered a steppingstone to higher office because Anaheim is Orange
County's second most populous city.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, when the City Council overturned the Planning
Commission's denial of Gigante's liquor license, paving the way for
its move into the city, Kring voted for it and Feldhaus against it.</TE>
<TE>   A larger question is whether the poll guards controversy will
resonate during a campaign in which bread-and-butter issues such as
crime and traffic seem to dominate.</TE>
<TE>   Democrat Tom Umberg, who defeated Pringle in 1990 to take over his
Assembly seat, said the poll guards turned out to be a minor concern
to voters, who were far more interested in neighborhood problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the poll-guard thing would be like gasoline on a fire
but, walking precincts, it was a big zero," Umberg said. "What it did
was raise the visibility of the race significantly, so people paid
attention to it."</TE>

<LD>An Amtrak train bound for Seattle that derailed Wednesday struck a
steel bar on the tracks, according to Union Pacific Railroad
spokesman John Bromley.</LD>
<LD>   Seven passengers suffered minor injuries in the accident.</LD>
<LD>   Bromley said the Coast Starlight was traveling at 65 mph, 14 mph
under the allowed speed limit, when it struck the 40-inch bar, which
joins rail cars to couplers. The bar apparently had been dropped by a
freight train using the track earlier, Bromley said. How the drawbar
was dropped and why it went unnoticed is being investigated, he said.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two men in their early 20s were fatally shot Sunday afternoon near
Garfield High School in what sheriff's investigators believe were
gang-related killings.</LD>
<LD>   The victims were walking in the 400 block of Fraser Avenue when
two suspects in an orange or faded red 1980s Ford Escort pulled up.
The passenger got out, walked up to the victims and shot them.</LD>
<LD>   One victim was shot in the back and fell to the sidewalk,
according to Lt. Raymond Peavy of the sheriff's homicide unit. He
said the second victim tried to escape by attempting to scale the
fence at Garfield High School, but the gunman shot him.</LD>
<TE>   The gunman returned to the second victim and shot him again as he
lay on the ground, Peavy said.</TE>
<TE>   The victims' identities were withheld pending notification of next
of kin. Investigators are searching for two 18-to 20-year-old
suspects with shaved heads.</TE>

<DH>Secession: Many first-time office seekers are running
grass-roots campaigns for posts that may not exist if two cityhood
measures fail.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Across the San Fernando Valley and in Hollywood, 122 candidates for
city councils that do not--and may never--exist have been thrust onto
the front lines of the secession movement.</LD>
<LD>   They and their supporters, as well as others who are unaffiliated
with the candidates but support the breakup of Los Angeles, see the
scores of grass-roots, underfunded campaigns and volunteer networks
as the vanguard of cityhood efforts that seek to remake the map of
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Jerry Hays, a Valley council candidate and painting contractor,
recently put it this way to a roomful of fellow Valley residents: "If
everybody in this room would call everybody they know, and they would
all agree to call everybody they know, we could not lose."</LD>
<TE>   In training sessions sponsored by secession backers, first-time
candidates are learning how to speak to the media (take a simple
mantra and keep repeating it), how to gain votes (knock on doors and
meet your neighbors) and how to sell secession (memorize key facts
about how a new city would be run).</TE>
<TE>   "They're sort of a manifestation of an idea and of a dream,"
Richard Katz, co-chairman of the San Fernando Valley Independence
Committee, said of the candidates. "The dream is of a smaller, more
representative city, and if [someone] walks to your door as a
potential candidate, it makes it real. It puts flesh and bones on the
[campaign] mail you get."</TE>
<TE>   And although the Valley cityhood campaign plans to organize
volunteers to talk to residents about secession, organizers also hope
to piggyback on the candidates' efforts and increase the number of
"yes" votes as friends, neighbors and followers turn out to support
each individual.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, campaign Director Gerry Gunster has urged the 104
candidates for mayor and council to avoid bashing their opponents and
concentrate instead on pushing cityhood.</TE>
<TE>   "What I do when I go out is I talk about Valley independence,"
said candidate Jay Rosenzweig, a private detective who is using his
wife's law office as his campaign headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Although he is raising a modest amount of money and hopes to put
on a campaign, Rosenzweig said he is not worried about his opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "If cityhood wins and I don't get the seat, I'll still feel like
I've accomplished something," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, 18 people are running for council of a proposed new
city, according to the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder's list
as of Friday afternoon. The top five vote-getters would be elected
and choose a mayor from among themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Ramsey, an architect who is among the Hollywood candidates,
said his running mates appear more interested in securing cityhood
than in their own political success.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of us aren't campaigning against one another. We're working
for Hollywood," Ramsey said, adding that his primary goal is to get
out the message that Hollywood would improve as its own city. Several
candidates are conducting political coffees together, said Ramsey,
president of the Hollywood Knolls Community Club.</TE>
<TE>   Secession measures for the Valley and Hollywood will appear on the
Nov. 5 ballot. A majority of votes from the proposed city and Los
Angeles as a whole are needed for each measure to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Reliance on a phalanx of citizen-candidates embodies a romantic
notion of democracy and could work in a small-town setting, said
Fernando Guerra, director of the Center for the Study of Los Angeles
at Loyola Marymount University. But it does not take into account the
realities of big-city politics, where it takes big money to reach
enough voters to ensure a victory, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Symbolically, I favor their approach," Guerra said. "But in
reality, it hasn't worked in a big American city in 40 years. And
there's no reason to believe that it would work this November."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem, Guerra and others said, is that Valley
candidates will campaign mostly in the Valley, where cityhood already
has support. The more pressing need is to win votes in other parts of
Los Angeles, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Valley secession backers have said they hope to win a large enough
majority in the Valley to overcome a mild loss from the rest of the
city. Early polls, however, show secession trailing overall, in part
because it is failing badly in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the Valley candidates are being advised by a central
campaign committee whose out-of-town political strategists are
unfamiliar with Southern California requirements. For instance, most
shopping centers require a week's notice and an application before
volunteers can hand out literature. As a result, the campaign's first
foray into the community was put off a week, as organizers gathered
and filled out applications.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the candidates' early outreach to the media has been
awkward, critics said. During a training session, for instance,
secession backers asked reporters to leave the room and then warned
candidates to think twice before granting interviews.</TE>
<TE>   "It's decidedly unnatural political advice," said Arnold
Steinberg, a Republican political strategist who has served as an
advisor to the secession movement. "It's not the way people run for
office."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the candidates operate businesses or hold jobs and cannot
do much campaigning during the day. Sometimes, religious obligations
get in the way.</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Carlos Ferreyra, a leader of the cityhood movement, said
he did not expect to begin campaigning in earnest until after the
Jewish High Holidays in mid-September.</TE>
<TE>   Still, candidates are beginning to venture out, holding campaign
coffees and walking precincts.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to run for office
without raising hundreds of thousands of dollars," Rosenzweig said.
"That's why I'm doing this. This is a race for the underdog."</TE>
<TE>   Susan Deas, 33, a city council candidate from Northridge, works
from an office in her mother's house, where Deas grew up and still
lives.</TE>
<TE>   The yard is filled with containers of debris from the 1994
Northridge earthquake. The Deas family is still embroiled in a battle
over the insurance settlement from the quake and must save the
detritus for upcoming court hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Deas said she hopes to raise at least $1,000 for her campaign. She
has won the support of older neighborhood activists who have known
her since she was a little girl, she said.</TE>
<TE>   She plans to walk precincts, participate in debates and set up a
Web page. But, like others who are running, Deas is uncomfortable
trying to raise large amounts of money. That would make her like the
big-city politicians many secessionists are trying to defeat, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Jose E. San Miguel, 60, originally from the state of
Tamaulipas, Mexico, set out recently to find support at Hansen Dam.
He put up a table and covered it with photographs: of himself running
in marathons, of the run-down sections of the park that he is working
to improve and of running clubs and school athletic classes he has
sponsored.</TE>
<TE>   San Miguel, who has lived in Pacoima for 30 years, has the support
of neighborhood council members as well as fellow runners and
families from Pacoima who use the park.</TE>
<TE>   He has promised to put bathrooms near the dam, where hundreds of
people come daily to run, walk and ride horses. San Miguel also said
he would donate his council salary to the new city.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got a big heart, and he tries to do the right thing in the
community," said Heidi Paul, who serves on the board of the Foothill
Trails District Neighborhood Council.</TE>
<TE>   San Miguel personifies much of what secession backers had hoped
they would find in candidates: community leaders with a vision for
their area. But he does not aggressively push secession itself.</TE>
<TE>   "It is their decision," he said of the voters. "I cannot tell them
what to believe."</TE>
<TE>   That's also true of Scott Svonkin, a legislative aide who is
running for Valley council in the Studio City/Sherman Oaks area.
Svonkin said he has raised more than $80,000 and hired political
consultant Rick Taylor to run his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But Svonkin said he does not intend to use his money and time to
push for secession above his own candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   "I want the voters in Studio City and Sherman Oaks to get to know
Scott Svonkin," he said, "to get to know my record of public service
and my business accomplishments and get to know my wife and my
daughter."</TE>
<TE>   Although he outpaces most Valley candidates in terms of
fund-raising, Svonkin has been forced to economize. He leased space
on three billboards--none in his district--to promote his candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   "The billboards on Ventura Boulevard are so expensive, I wasn't
able to get them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the candidates would be new to elected office, but Paula
Boland, who is running in the Northridge council district, has been
there before. Boland is a former state assemblywoman who, during her
time in the Legislature, helped make the secession vote possible.</TE>
<TE>   But she too is keeping her campaign modest, fielding phone calls
from the kitchen of the house where she has lived since it was new in
1968. Boland has become an unpaid advisor of sorts for other
candidates, offering tips on precinct walking and fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   "I've given them real simple advice," she said. "The first thing
you do is get on the phone and raise money. You walk precincts.
Campaign events are OK, but ... then you have to get back on the
phone and raise more money.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know how much you're going to need," said Boland, who
held a fund-raiser over the weekend. "You have to raise enough to
win."</TE>
<TE>   Although Boland is one of secession's longest-running supporters
and an ardent advocate, she will not necessarily be out of office if
it fails. Boland also is running for City Council in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Farm Workers March to the Capitol, but Davis' Steps Will
Come Later</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Farm workers marched to the Capitol on Sunday and surrounded the
governor. They've got him within their grasp. They can't lose.</LD>
<LD>   Conversely, the governor can't win unless he eventually sides with
the workers and drags angry growers along with him.</LD>
<LD>   This is classic grass-roots, squeaky-wheel, protest politics--the
kind that trumps big money. It's about the only thing that does.</LD>
<TE>   Farm workers, most of whom earn less than $10,000 per year, don't
have spare dollars to spend on politicians' campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, agriculture interests have given Gov. Gray Davis
roughly $1.5 million, including more than $100,000 earlier this month
as the Democratic Legislature was passing a bill they opposed to
greatly strengthen the workers' collective bargaining position with
growers.</TE>
<TE>   But the United Farm Workers union, though weakened from its heyday
in the '70s, does possess potent symbolism that can inspire or shame,
especially Democrats in power. It symbolizes exploited labor, liberal
activism and the legend of Cesar Chavez, the late UFW founder.</TE>
<TE>   The workers also have rich celebrities on their side, Hollywood
activist-donors who particularly impress this governor. Dozens signed
an open letter urging Davis to sign the workers' bill, including
Warren Beatty, Robert Redford, Barbra Streisand, Jack Nicholson,
Martin Sheen....</TE>
<TE>   Union members, marching behind their red and black Aztec eagle
flag, reached the Capitol on a mildly warm day. The governor was
nowhere to be seen. But he'd already gotten the message, both from
the workers and the powerful author of their bill, Senate leader John
Burton (D-San Francisco).</TE>
<TE>   "If he vetoes this," Burton said, "I will never forgive him."</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 5,000 workers and their supporters packed the north
steps and lawn of the Capitol. Some had marched for 10 days, 150
miles up from Merced.</TE>
<TE>   One was UFW co-founder Dolores Huerta, 72. In 1966, she had
marched with Chavez for 25 days from Delano's grape fields to the
Capitol, a historic trek that put their union on the map.</TE>
<TE>   Huerta nearly died last year from an abdominal aneurysm that
required massive blood transfusions. But she marched each day last
week, saying: "This bill is so important to me that if the governor
signs it, I would die happy."</TE>
<TE>   The purpose of that first march 36 years ago was to gain public
sympathy for the farm workers' cause. It succeeded, leading to
collective bargaining rights nine years later.</TE>
<TE>   The stated purpose of the latest march was to pressure Davis into
signing the workers' bill, which would permit binding arbitration
when contract talks between the union and a grower are deadlocked.</TE>
<TE>   But clearly the march also was undertaken to rekindle the Chavez
spirit and reassert the union into the Democratic political
consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   The UFW, indeed, did receive a political and publicity boost from
the trek. Moreover, it's likely that some collective bargaining
improvement--perhaps even binding arbitration--ultimately will be
signed by Davis, assuming he is reelected in November.</TE>
<TE>   But not right now, apparently, despite last-minute negotiations
between UFW and grower representatives that were coordinated by the
Davis administration. This particular bill is headed for a veto.</TE>
<TE>   "There'll be serious negotiations next year," says a Davis senior
advisor. "The union's already on third base. They're going to win no
matter what."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, a Democratic governor--who owes his election to
organized labor--must side with impoverished workers, not
Republican-leaning growers.</TE>
<TE>   Davis realizes the present collective bargaining system doesn't
work for field hands, aides say. But the UFW is asking for
revolutionary change in labor law and, let's face it, this governor
is an incrementalist who prefers itty-bitty steps to bold moves.</TE>
<TE>   He is the self-proclaimed canoeist who paddles a little on the
left, a little on the right and keeps going slowly down the middle.
The best signal that Davis plans to veto the farm labor bill was his
disclosure last week that, after months of ruminating, he now intends
to sign a measure allowing illegal immigrants to obtain a driver's
license.</TE>
<TE>   One stroke on the left for immigrants, one on the right for
growers.</TE>
<TE>   A strong case politically can be made, however, for signing the
bill now. Davis' biggest danger on Nov. 5 is that liberals--the
Democratic base--will be so disgusted with him, largely because of
his canoeist centrism, that they'll refuse to vote. Rejecting the
farm workers' bill only will aggravate their hostility.</TE>
<TE>   That's why any veto message should outline a possible path for
compromise between workers and growers. Then Davis will have to put
together the deal, making both sides feel happy about it. He'll need
all his paddling skills.</TE>

<HD>No Team, but Plenty of Spirit</HD>
<DH>CSUCI: Inaugural class is just happy to be part of history,
minus sports, dorms or even a student union, at new university
opening today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are no sports teams, no dorm rooms and only the start of a
student union.</LD>
<LD>   But to be part of the inaugural class at Cal State Channel
Islands, Katie Schuberg, 19, is willing to overlook those
shortcomings.</LD>
<LD>   "Just being part of the first class, being able to pave the way,
is really exciting," said Schuberg, an English major and Moorpark
College graduate who turned down a slot at UC Santa Barbara to attend
the new campus, 15 minutes from her Camarillo home.</LD>
<TE>   "I'll be able to look back and say I had a part in starting that
school," she said. "It's an opportunity for good experiences and lots
of firsts."</TE>
<TE>   Those same opportunities will be available to more than 700
students who will make up the first class at Cal State Channel
Islands, pioneers who have hitched a ride at the end of a long, hard
journey to deliver a four-year public university to Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Set in a series of renovated, 1930s-era buildings at the former
Camarillo State Hospital complex, the campus opens today, after an
Aug. 16 grand opening ceremony attended by Gov. Gray Davis, state and
local officials and hundreds of university boosters.</TE>
<TE>   But it will be no ordinary first day of school.</TE>
<TE>   For many, it will culminate a decades-long campaign to create a
Cal State campus in a region where generations of students have had
no choice but to leave if they wanted a state college degree.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County has long been the largest county in California
without such an institution. And despite its relative affluence and
top-caliber high schools, the county has lagged behind counties of
comparable size and wealth when it comes to sending students to a
four-year college.</TE>
<TE>   Educators and university boosters blame the lack of a Cal State
campus for that lag, saying local students have had limited options
after graduating from high school or community college.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm excited that students who work so hard at the junior colleges
now don't have to travel so far to continue their education," said
Julie Stoneburg, 24, of Oxnard. "We have really needed something
closer."</TE>
<TE>   Stoneburg's story is typical.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Simi Valley High School in 1995, she waited
a few years before pursuing a college degree. She started at Ventura
College in 2000 and graduated last spring.</TE>
<TE>   While at Ventura College, counselors began talking to her about
Channel Islands. She was hooked once she visited the site, deciding
that the sprawling campus snuggled at the base of the Santa Monica
Mountains was where she wanted to spend the next three years earning
her liberal studies degree and teaching credential.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just in awe," Stoneburg said of the place dominated by
Spanish-style buildings crowned with red-tile roofs.</TE>
<TE>   "I went onto the [Cal State] campus at Northridge, and it was so
crowded and so busy I was nothing but a number," she said. "I love
the feeling I get on the Channel Islands campus. It feels like home
and it's just my size."</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,100 students applied to be part of the inaugural
class, and by the second week of August, 716 had been accepted. The
university's target enrollment for the first year was about 750
full-and part-time students.</TE>
<TE>   More students applied for the liberal studies major than any
other. The business degree was next most popular, followed by the
teacher credential program.</TE>
<TE>   The inaugural class was only open to upper-division transfer
students, and most were on track to make up the university's first
graduating class in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of those students took part this summer in six
orientation sessions, where they met with academic advisors,
registered for classes and picked up parking passes and ID cards.</TE>
<TE>   At one orientation last month, those students included Simi Valley
resident Terry Jenkins, 23, a business major transferring from
Moorpark College.</TE>
<TE>   "This place appealed to me because it was a new campus, but it
does take some getting used to," said Jenkins, referring to the
university's former life as a state mental hospital. "It's a little
eerie at first, but I don't mind it."</TE>
<TE>   Nanette Tobin, 24, had her hands full during orientation. With
6-month-old daughter Madison in one arm and registration materials in
the other, the Santa Barbara native juggled a full load during the
daylong session.</TE>
<TE>   Tobin earned her associate's degree from Santa Barbara City
College and after a few years off, planned to resume her college
career at UC Santa Barbara. But she set her sights on Channel Islands
after learning that the liberal arts major at the Santa Barbara
school was full and she wouldn't be able to go there until next year.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard about this school and I said, 'I'm coming,' " said Tobin,
who is hoping to join other students with children to launch a
child-care club at the Camarillo campus. "I want to teach, and this
will make my wait shorter."</TE>
<TE>   Greg Sawyer, Channel Islands' vice president for student affairs,
said one of the best things about the university is that students
like Tobin will be able to launch clubs and campus organizations to
meet the needs not only of the inaugural class but future students.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys really have something that is truly exceptional,"
Sawyer said. "They have an opportunity to help us shape the future of
this university."</TE>
<TE>   That's why Katie Schuberg can live with the idea that there are
not yet any sports teams or dorms at Cal State Channel Islands. She
attended orientation with her mother, Mary Schuberg. And both could
see that today's opening is no ordinary first day of school, but
history in the making.</TE>
<TE>   "They took pictures of all the first students," said Mary
Schuberg, a Camarillo resident who is sending her fifth and youngest
child into the state college system. "Years from now, when they look
back in the history books at the beginning of this college, they will
be able to realize the importance of what they have done."</TE>

<HD>Calabasas Wants Stars in Its Skies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The movement's motto might be "Let there be dark."</LD>
<LD>   Calabasas has joined the growing number of communities worldwide
that want skies illuminated by stars, not Klieg lights.</LD>
<LD>   Limiting light pollution has long been a goal of the upscale
community in the west San Fernando Valley, according to Mayor Lesley
Devine.</LD>
<TE>   The city is now hammering out a so-called dark skies ordinance
that takes a common-sense approach to outdoor lighting, she said.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Dark skies' is simply the new buzz word for considerate
lighting," Devine said. "If a new house was built next to you and
they had floodlights shining into your bedroom, you wouldn't be
happy. If they had low-level security lights that shone down on their
own property, you wouldn't care."</TE>
<TE>   The nearby community of Agoura Hills is also considering an
ordinance, said Jeff Reinhardt, the city's mayor pro-tem. The process
there is just beginning, but many community members have expressed a
desire for less light at night.</TE>
<TE>   "We're losing our stars and our view of the heavens," said
resident Pat MacGregor, 69. "I went out every night [last] week and
tried to see the meteor shower, and I never could."</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, MacGregor lived in Old Agoura, a rural area that
has barred streetlights to preserve its inky night skies.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because we live in the city doesn't mean we can't have some
of the benefits of living in the country," MacGregor said. "It may
sound trivial compared to other things, but every little bit we lose
adds up."</TE>
<TE>   The movement to use less light has burgeoned since 1988, with the
formation of the International Dark-Sky Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Based in Tucson, the nonprofit group has about 9,500 members,
including many astronomers who have long been aware that artificial
light obscures the heavens. The organization advocates more
intelligent outdoor lighting, including shielding streetlights and
directing light--where needed--down, not up, where it does little
more than illuminate the undersides of birds, as the group likes to
point out.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the Czech Republic instituted the first national law
limiting light pollution. So many communities are adopting similar
ordinances that the group has trouble keeping track of them, said
technical manager Scott Davis.</TE>
<TE>   New Mexico has a state law limiting artificial light, and eight
Southern California communities have ordinances, including San Diego
and Palm Desert, said Laverne Booth, an amateur astronomer with the
association.</TE>
<TE>   When celestial objects are visible, Booth said, "what you are
seeing is a beautiful spectacle. But when you understand what you're
seeing, it becomes even more impressive. There's a saying that
backyard astronomy is the gateway to science education."</TE>
<TE>   In Calabasas, former mayor and current Councilwoman Janice Lee has
been a forceful advocate for such measures as covering the tops of
lights and using no-glare lighting.</TE>
<TE>   "There seems to be a forgotten element to all our planning--what
happens when the sun goes down," Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   She would like to see an ordinance that applies to residences,
businesses and public buildings alike.</TE>
<TE>   "I think one of our worst offenders is our city facilities," she
said, citing city tennis courts "lit up like alien landing zones."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the city brought in a professional lighting consultant
who specified preferred light levels in lumens, a standard unit of
light measurement in science, and made other technical
recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   Some members of the council found the resultant document hard to
understand, including Devine, who said her philosophy is, "If you
can't explain it to your grandmother or your 10-year-old, don't vote
for it."</TE>
<TE>   Devine said she wants to make sure the new ordinance does not put
too great an economic burden on current residents.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless it's for health and safety, I don't think it's right to
make existing residents retrofit at great expense," she said. "New
development is fair game.''</TE>
<TE>   The city staff is now drafting a more accessible ordinance for the
council to consider.</TE>
<TE>   Once people come to think of light as a pollutant, they begin to
see its downside. As Reinhardt pointed out, wildlife shares the land
with humans in Agoura Hills and nearby communities, and inappropriate
lighting can disrupt the animals.</TE>
<TE>   Dark-sky advocates said mountain lions avoiding artificial light
sometimes miss the crucial bridges that connect parts of their
shrinking habitat.</TE>
<TE>   And millions of migrating birds and billions of insects slam into
lighted towers and other structures each year.</TE>
<TE>   Security is often cited as a reason to keep on outdoor lights. But
dark-sky proponents said higher light levels offer no guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   Better technology such as motion detectors can improve security,
they said, without wasting energy or obscuring the Milky Way.</TE>

<HD>France Asks U.S. to Probe Couple's Charges</HD>
<DH>Arrest: Man and French wife say they were beaten at home by
sheriff's deputies who came to arrest them after a bar bill dispute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The French Consulate has asked the U.S. State Department to
investigate charges that four Riverside County sheriff's deputies
beat a French woman and her mentally disabled American husband after
the couple failed to pay a bar tab.</LD>
<LD>   Consulate officials in Los Angeles filed a complaint with the
State Department earlier this month, asking for an explanation of the
couple's injuries, including a broken arm that the man allegedly
suffered while being questioned at home July 23.</LD>
<LD>   Isabella Behrens, 41, and Martin Behrens, 44, were arrested at
their Palm Desert home. They have said that deputies beat them before
taking them into custody, and later charged the couple with battery
on a police officer and defrauding an innkeeper. The two pleaded not
guilty to those charges in an Indio courtroom last week.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just shocking," said Valerie Luebken, press spokeswoman for
the consulate. "America is supposed to be the country of immigration,
civil rights and tolerance."</TE>
<TE>   Although Riverside County sheriff's officials said the couple had
never filed a complaint with the sheriff's office, an internal
investigation has begun, said Tom Freeman, executive officer for the
agency.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad, if what they said is true," Freeman said. "If a person
does something out of line, the sheriff has a long-standing policy to
administer discipline, which can include up to termination."</TE>
<TE>   Freeman said he could not discuss the incident further because of
the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Isabella Behrens and her husband said they are in physical
therapy, recovering from the beating. "I understand sometimes police
might be in danger," said Isabella Behrens, sole caregiver for her
husband since an accident left him partially brain-damaged four years
ago. "But we're not criminals."</TE>
<TE>   The dispute began after the couple ate dinner at Bananas Bar and
Grill in Palm Desert and moved into the bar area. As they joined in
with some karaoke singers, Isabella Behrens said, a group of men and
women sitting nearby mocked them, mimicking her French accent and her
husband's pronounced slur.</TE>
<TE>   As the teasing intensified, Isabella Behrens said, she tossed a
glass of water onto a man she described as the ringleader, prompting
a Bananas employee to ask the Behrenses to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the bar, a Bananas manager demanded money for their tab,
which was less than $20, Isabella Behrens said. She told him she
would not return inside for him to run her credit card as long as her
tormentors were there. She promised to return the following day with
the money.</TE>
<TE>   As they left, the Bananas manager became furious and threatened to
call police, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bananas representatives did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Behrenses were only home long enough to change into pajamas
when deputies arrived, Isabella Behrens said.</TE>
<TE>   "They just barged in and started screaming, 'You didn't pay your
bill!' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   Behrens told the deputies that she was a French citizen and wanted
to call the consulate. But that just seemed to anger one of the
deputies, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "He pushed me on the couch and hit me twice on my kidney with his
baton," she said. "I got punched on top of my nose, eyebrow, chin,
stomach, back.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept saying, 'I'm not fighting, why are you hurting me?' " said
Isabella Behrens, who is 5-foot-4 and weighs 108 pounds. At one
point, an officer picked her up and slammed her against a hallway
wall, she said. "Then he said, 'Do you need a translator for that?' "
Behrens said.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Behrens was also slammed against the ground and beaten, she
said. Assuming that the deputies thought her husband was drunk
because of his unstable walk and slurred speech, she said, she tried
to tell them about his disability.</TE>
<TE>   Isabella Behrens was taken to jail. She later learned her husband
had been taken to a hospital before also being jailed.</TE>
<TE>   They were released the next morning.</TE>
<TE>   Both appeared in court last week to plead not guilty to all the
charges.</TE>
<TE>   A few days after their release from jail, the consulate's office
in Los Angeles sent them to a doctor, who treated them for swellings,
bruises and cuts. Martin Behrens also had a broken arm.</TE>
<TE>   "He had bruises all over his face," Luebken said. "Half of her
face was black and blue. It was obvious what was done to them."</TE>
<TE>   Luebken said she had asked State Department representatives for an
investigation. A Newport Beach attorney, Jerry Steerings, who has
been hired to represent the couple, said charges that the Behrenses
beat the deputies are ridiculous.</TE>
<TE>   "This petite woman and this disabled man beat up the cops?" said
Steerings, who said he plans to file a lawsuit on their behalf. "It's
nonsense."</TE>
<TE>   Isabella Behrens came to the United States in 1995 to live in what
she called her dream country. She worked as a waitress and soon met
Martin. They married two years later, and her husband supported them
with contract work until he fell 50 feet while pruning a tree. He was
left with permanent brain damage and they live on his disability
benefits, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Isabella Behrens said the incident had changed her feelings about
this country.</TE>
<TE>   "On Sept. 11, I was out on the streets waving my American flag
with everyone else," Behrens said. "I love this country. And at the
end of the year, I would become an American citizen. Now? No, no, I
don't think so."</TE>

<LD>A man told to leave a teenage girl's birthday party Saturday night in

left, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The two men were hospitalized in serious but stable condition with
multiple gunshot wounds following what police described as a
gang-related shooting.</LD>
<LD>   The shots were fired about 11 p.m. outside the American Legion
Hall in the 100 block of South Lemon Street, where a party was being
held for a 15-year-old girl.</LD>
<TE>   "When the party broke up, there was a verbal altercation," said
Lt. Bob Green of the Orange Police Department. "The shooter broke out
a small handgun and opened fire on the victims."</TE>
<TE>   Police would not release the names of anyone involved. One victim
was 22 and the other was 26.</TE>
<TE>   Police described the gunman as a 27-year-old Latino man with a

<HD>San Francisco Rethinks Cash Aid to Homeless</HD>
<DH>Poverty: City generosity fuels alcohol and drug abuse, say
those who push for far smaller payouts, more services.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>As other cities slashed cash payments to their homeless populations
in recent years, San Francisco held out, living up to its national
image as a city of compassion and tolerance.</LD>
<LD>   But buffeted by the dot-com collapse and other economic woes, many
San Franciscans today see themselves as America's last soft touch.
Some say the city's reputation for generosity has made it a magnet
for street dwellers, whose numbers fluctuate between 7,000 and
10,000. Tourism promoters complain that aggressive panhandlers are
driving visitors away.</LD>
<LD>   Recent public opinion polls show that a large majority of city
residents favor a proposal on the fall ballot that would slash
homeless general assistance payments to roughly one-fifth of what
they are today.</LD>
<TE>   Cities and states have been making payments to homeless people
since the early 1980s, when their numbers began to rise dramatically.
After the Clinton administration in 1996 started emphasizing housing
and job training over such direct payments, many cities followed
suit.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco voters list homelessness as by far the most serious
problem facing the city. Two leading candidates for next year's
mayoral election are sponsoring November initiatives to address the
homelessness issue.</TE>
<TE>   Attracting the most attention is an initiative proposed by San
Francisco Supervisor Gavin Newsom that would drastically reduce
payments to single homeless adults. His measure--called Care Not
Cash--would trim one of the country's most generous stipends from
$320 a month to $59, and replace the cash with the promise of
equivalent spending on housing and services.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Los Angeles County, with the state's largest homeless
caseload, currently dispenses $221 a month in general relief to
individuals but limits the payments to eight months a year and
imposes additional restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Most other counties, required by state law to provide support to
the indigent, give out much less cash than San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Supported by the city's business establishment and struggling
tourism industry, Newsom, a Democrat who leads the polls among early
mayoral favorites, argues that the flow of cash to a population
wracked by drug abuse, alcoholism and mental illness does more harm
than good.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to redefine our definition of compassion," said Newsom,
who contends that the government is contributing to the city's
alarming death rate among homeless people by supporting
self-destructive habits.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Pablo Stewart, director of psychiatric services at San
Francisco's Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic, agreed, saying: "It is not
only clinically incorrect but almost sadistic to give money on a
regular basis to people who have a demonstrated inability to handle
cash funds."</TE>
<TE>   The Care Not Cash proposal has sparked a firestorm of protest
among homeless rights groups, who see the effort as an attempt to do
in San Francisco what New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani did in
his much-publicized cleanup of Times Square, which rid much of the
area of homeless people, partly by banning sidewalk bivouacs and
expanding city-run shelters.</TE>
<TE>   Accusing Newsom of trying to "Giuliani-ize" San Francisco,
homeless advocate Paul Bodin contended that the main intent of the
Care Not Cash movement is to make homeless people disappear from the
streets.</TE>
<TE>   Plan Called 'Heartless'</TE>
<TE>   "The Newsom plan is heartless, ruthless and basically immoral,"
said Sister Bernie Galvin, a Roman Catholic nun who directs the
Religious Witness With Homeless People advocacy group here.</TE>
<TE>   Each summer, the 69-year-old Galvin, an Oklahoma native who came
to San Francisco after working as a labor organizer and social
activist in North Carolina and Texas, stages a memorial service for
homeless people who die on city streets. In 1999, the count reached
169. Over the last 15 years, 1,843 homeless people have died on the
streets, Galvin said.</TE>
<TE>   Newsom, a 34-year-old restaurateur, argues that the high mortality
rate is precisely the reason to cut cash payments.</TE>
<TE>   "In nearly half these cases," Newsom wrote in a recent article in
the San Francisco Chronicle, "the cause of death was an overdose of
drugs or alcohol. This is the cost of our failure: a toll of drugs,
alcohol and death that is the shame of San Francisco."</TE>
<TE>   Groups Protest</TE>
<TE>   Protests by homeless advocacy groups, including the militant
People Organized to Win Employment Rights (POWER), have thwarted
several of Newsom's public appearances, forcing the supervisor to
leave under police escort.</TE>
<TE>   But his stand on the issue has also won Newsom widespread support.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 75% of San Francisco voters favor his Care Not Cash
initiative, according to a July survey conducted by the polling firm
Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin &amp; Associates for the Chinese American
Voters Education Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The same poll showed Newsom, with 36% support, leading his closest
two potential rivals, Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano,
with 23%, and state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, with 6%.</TE>
<TE>   Ammiano drafted a last-minute homeless initiative of his own for
the November ballot, saying: "People no longer want the status quo."</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time homelessness has emerged as a key issue
in a mayoral contest.</TE>
<TE>   Art Agnos, mayor from 1987 to 1991, lost his bid for a second term
to former police chief Frank Jordan, who hammered Agnos for opening
up San Francisco's Civic Center Square to several hundred homeless
squatters in what was then dubbed "Camp Agnos."</TE>
<TE>   But Jordan got caught in the backlash against his crackdown on
homelessness in 1995 when he ran for reelection against the current
mayor, Willie Brown. Barred by the city's term limits law from
running again, Brown has skirted the homelessness issue, letting
Newsom and other politicians take the lead.</TE>
<TE>   'Mother's Day' Largess</TE>
<TE>   The city's homeless population is most in evidence the first and
15th day of each month, known here as "Mother's Day," when assistance
checks are handed out by a local chain of all-night check-cashing and
payday loan outlets under a contract with the city.</TE>
<TE>   On the eve of the most recent payday, the line of homeless men
started forming before midnight in front of the Money Mark
check-cashing shop in the Tenderloin District, San Francisco's skid
row.</TE>
<TE>   Across the street, orange-vested city work crews blasted the
sidewalks with high pressure hoses to remove human waste and trash
left by squatters at United Nations Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Police Officer Scott Korte was on Market Street
issuing a citation to a man for urinating in a public place. "Two
blocks away is the main drug dealing area," Korte said. "Sometimes
the dealers just stand outside the door. It always gets busier here
payday."</TE>
<TE>   Citing studies by the Rand Corp., Haight-Ashbury clinic
psychiatrist Stewart estimates that 60% to 75% of homeless people
receiving general assistance have some history of substance abuse. He
estimates that 30% to 50% of homeless people suffer from mental
illness.</TE>
<TE>   One of the men standing in line at the Money Mark was 37-year-old
Paul James Salks, an ex-Marine.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of Salks, who were contacted by The Times, said he was
student body president of his North Carolina high school before
falling into a pattern of alcoholism that exacerbated a history of
mental illness. Both of his parents also are homeless, said brother
David Salks, a civil engineer in Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   After cashing his general assistance check, Salks, clearly drunk
and wobbly on his feet, said he planned to use the money to travel to
Seattle to investigate the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill off the
coast of Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   But before he even made it to the street, a wad of new bills
dangling from his clenched fist, Salks got into an argument with a
drug dealer over a glass crack pipe he wanted to buy. The dispute
ended when Salks passed out $20 bills to the dealer and several
swarming antagonists.</TE>
<TE>   Even some recipients of "Mother's Day" largess are critical of the
system on which they depend.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Reynolds, 36, described himself as a ski instructor and
fishing boat pilot temporarily down on his luck. Reynolds, a native
of Cape Cod, Mass., said he got stuck in San Francisco two days
before Christmas last year when someone broke into his Chevrolet van
and stole $4,000 he had hidden in a mattress.</TE>
<TE>   His efforts to find work since have mostly failed. Lately, he has
taken to positioning himself outside paint stores hoping to catch a
day-labor painting job. At night, he sleeps in the van.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds, who said he conquered a severe drinking problem eight
years ago, said he is grateful for the money. "I've never been in
this predicament before," he said. But he is troubled by the abuse he
sees of the cash-payment system.</TE>
<TE>   "I can guarantee you that over 70% of this money is going right
back into drugs. Some of the things allowed to happen in San
Francisco would never be permitted back home in Boston," Reynolds
said before leaving to buy laundry soap and a pack of cigarettes.</TE>

<DH>Shelter: Activists want Costa Mesa to help improve
conditions for renters. Residents say they pay more, get less.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of church activists Sunday called on Costa Mesa officials
to adopt new regulations to ensure that better housing conditions
accompany the area's rapidly rising rents.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the Orange County Congregation Community Organization
asked the city to appoint a housing ombudsman to mediate
landlord-tenant problems. They also demanded increased code
enforcement and an ordinance that would require landlords to give
evicted tenants 60 days' notice instead of the current 30 days.</LD>
<LD>   The organization, which represents 3,500 families that attend
dozens of Orange County churches, has been a strong advocate for
low-income families on issues relating to housing, education and
health care.</LD>
<TE>   Members met at St. Joachim Church in Costa Mesa on Sunday to
release the findings of an 18-month study showing how rents are
steadily rising in the city.</TE>
<TE>   The study included interviews with 400 parishioners who live in
six high-density areas in the city.</TE>
<TE>   It showed that seven of 10 respondents were familiar with the
Orange County Fair Housing Council, which mediates landlord-tenant
disputes, and that only four of 20 apartment managers interviewed had
proper job training, said Elias Cuevas, one of the parishioners who
has collected data.</TE>
<TE>   "The landlords do very little to respond to our needs," said
Juanita Perez, a church member whose rent has increased from $650 to
$835 in four years. "There isn't enough maintenance, and we want to
see change."</TE>
<TE>   Cuevas said the organization learned that last year fewer than 100
landlords were cited for housing violations in a city with 24,000
rental units.</TE>
<TE>   Speakers also stressed that low-income housing is scarce, pointing
out that 17,000 Orange County residents are waiting for a federal
housing subsidy known as Section 8. Of the 400 families interviewed,
150 had applied for Section 8 and only one had received the
assistance.</TE>
<TE>   City Council members Gary Monahan and Karen Robinson attended the
session and both said they would like to see increased code
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   But they shied from committing the city to a 60-day eviction
notice.</TE>
<TE>   Monahan said he would like to meet with the group again next
month, and Robinson said she would like to study the proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is a big need for an ombudsman in all of Orange
County, particularly in Costa Mesa," Monahan said.</TE>
<TE>   Some Spanish-speaking tenants, who used translators to express
their frustrations to council members, described how their rents have
jumped significantly while conditions in their apartments had
remained the same or deteriorated.</TE>
<TE>   Amalia Perez Pedroza, who lives on Costa Mesa's west side, said
her landlord gave her 18 days' notice on June 12 that she would have
to leave her apartment because of construction. Five days later, the
landlord began a noisy roofing project that made it difficult to stay
even the 18 days, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an injustice. It was inconsiderate. The city needs
stricter controls over the landlords so this cannot happen," Perez
Pedroza said.</TE>
<TE>   Hugo Mendez said he moved into an apartment last year and each
time the apartment manager changes, the rent does also. It has risen
from $650 to $850.</TE>
<TE>   "What do we get when we pay more? Nothing. It's the same
apartment, only a different manager," said Mendez. "And it costs a
lot more."</TE>

<HD>Yards So 'Ugly,' They're a Crime</HD>
<DH>Law: Palmdale begins the delicate process of enforcing a
controversial ordinance that makes it a misdemeanor to keep an
unattractive frontyard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Palmdale has warned hundreds of homeowners that they may be violating
a controversial ordinance requiring them to maintain attractive
frontyards.</LD>
<LD>   The law, passed in June 2001, aims to spruce up this wind-swept
desert city, where tidy suburban dream homes often sit next-door to
dusty, neglected lots. The city gave residents until this December to
get their yards in shape--either by planting grass lawns or
installing decorative rocks and native desert plants.</LD>
<LD>   This month, city code enforcement officials sent about 320 letters
to owners of properties that neighbors had complained about. Those
homeowners could be charged with misdemeanors and face fines of
$1,000 and six months in jail, city spokeswoman Barbara La Fata said.</LD>
<TE>   But Mike Morrisey, senior code enforcement officer, said his
office hopes to work with the violators, not punish them.</TE>
<TE>   Fines will probably not be levied, but if they are, they would be
for lesser code infractions and come to about $125 per household, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to help these people identify their problems, then
give them some time to make the changes," Morrisey said.</TE>
<TE>   The soft touch is an acknowledgment of the fierce opposition to
the ordinance that came from a number of quarters, including
libertarian desert dwellers, lawmakers concerned about local water
supplies and low-income residents who came to Palmdale because of its
relatively inexpensive housing market.</TE>
<TE>   Enforcement of Palmdale's landscaping law is also being watched
closely in neighboring Lancaster, where officials have expressed
interest in a similar ordinance. Lancaster Community Development
Director Brian Ludicke said he may present the City Council with a
number of proposals next month.</TE>
<TE>   The problem in Palmdale, Morrisey said, is "there are too many
people ... who don't understand what owning a home entails--and
sometimes with too little income to allow them to take care of their
property."</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, city staffers estimated that 3,000 homes lacked
adequate landscaping under the new law.</TE>
<TE>   A report found that half of those households would require city
subsidies to comply with the ordinance, at a cost of $750,000 to
$2.25 million.</TE>
<TE>   Disabled, elderly and low-income residents who cannot afford to
fix up their frontyards will be able to draw from the city's existing
home-improvement subsidy funds, which this year total about $450,000,
city Housing Manager Mike Adams said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite earlier estimates, Adams said that sum should be adequate
because the city plans to enforce the code only with properties that
have been the subject of complaints.</TE>
<TE>   For residents such as Mary Spiva--whose dirt yard is awaiting a
subsidized makeover under a separate city program--the success of the
ordinance depends on the city's ability to assist low-income
residents.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, she asked, "how particular are they going to get
about the lawns? Some people think ABC is attractive, while others
prefer XYZ."</TE>
<TE>   Residents have plenty of options, city officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale's Web site promotes rock gardens, water-saving
"xeriscape" lawns with specially chosen plants and
evaporation-minimizing mulches, and nearly 200 acceptable grasses,
shrubs and vines.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant City Planner Susan Koleda said Palmdale is even
considering a contest rewarding the best-kept lawn.</TE>
<TE>   Spiva said she's not going to enter any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   A while back, her lawn became plagued with small, annoying plants
she calls "stickers," so she decided to let the whole thing die out
and start over.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, it looks pretty bad, to be honest with you," she said.</TE>

<HD>On Oscar's Turf, Stanley Seizes the Day</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Ex-King Luc Robitaille brings the Red Wings'
championship trophy to Hollywood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nina McCormick snapped a picture, then walked up to the
athletic-looking guy holding the big silver cup in front of Grauman's
Chinese Theater, and asked, "What's your name?"</LD>
<LD>   "Luc Robitaille," the man replied, with a grin. And the cup's name
is Stanley. Stanley Cup. The real one that they gave to the Detroit
Red Wings this past season.</LD>
<LD>   McCormick, who hails from the Motor City, blushed redder than her
hometown hockey team's insignia. "I don't know all the names," the
retired General Motors worker said. "But my son goes to all the
games. He was right there when they won it."</LD>
<TE>   McCormick could be forgiven, since not far away were a fake
Spiderman, fake Wonder Woman, fake Yoda and fake Laurel and Hardy.</TE>
<TE>   But this was the real Robitaille, who played 12 seasons with the
Los Angeles Kings before heading to Detroit as a free agent last
year, and still calls this city home.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing--not even being unrecognized in Hollywood--could spoil the
old tradition of giving each member of the championship team 24 hours
to do what he wants with the coveted chalice.</TE>
<TE>   Robitaille hoisted it on Jurassic Park-The Ride, at Universal
Studios. Next, he held it aloft in front of the famed Chinese
theater, then trekked to the Hollywood sign with it before parading
it into Dodger Stadium, where he held it up at home plate before the
game started.</TE>
<TE>   "Is that the real thing?" asked Don Fennessey, 45, of Edmonton,
Canada, as Robitaille put the trophy in the mouth of Bruce, the
mechanical shark from Jaws, at Universal.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen it before," assured Fennessey, whose team, the Oilers,
held that trophy five times.</TE>
<TE>   Robitaille grinned like a child. "It's surreal," he said. "It's
been an amazing weekend. These are some of the best memories of my
life."</TE>
<TE>   After more than a few double-takes, reaction from fans was
enthusiastic.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows what that trophy means," Robitaille said. Asked
if he regretted not winning the trophy with the Kings, Robitaille
shrugged. "Things happen the way they happen in life," he said. "For
me, I'm just happy I won the cup."</TE>
<TE>   Robitaille, along with his two sons, wife, parents, brother and
about 30 other kin and friends, had the Jurassic Park ride all to
themselves for more than an hour before parading en masse through the
theme park.</TE>
<TE>   He mugged for photos, signed autographs and even let a few fans
touch the trophy--always under the stern gaze of a National Hockey
League official in a dark suit and white gloves.</TE>
<TE>   "We chose to come back and share it with L.A.," said Robitaille's
wife, Stacia. "He misses the fans."</TE>
<TE>   And the fans apparently miss him.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big mistake to let him go," said Rick Isaac of Agoura
Hills, who waited two hours at Universal to get Robitaille's
autograph. "His goodwill with the fans is what it's all about. That's
what you remember."</TE>
<TE>   Emilio Sandoval of Simi Valley got a Kings puck and jersey signed
by Robitaille, and was so excited that he asked Stacia to sign it
too.</TE>
<TE>   "We're waiting for the Kings to bring it now," he said. "But Luc
will always be a King."</TE>
<TE>   Though the sight of the glimmering cup sometimes elicited confused
stares, it was enough to cause Dave Knapp, a Detroit native
transplanted to San Diego, to abandon his wife and children on
Hollywood Boulevard and run for it.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the cup, I was like, 'Oh, my God. You take the kids. I'm
going after the cup,' " a breathless Knapp said.</TE>
<TE>   He caught up with the cup and Robitaille on the upper level of the
Hollywood and Highland entertainment complex.</TE>
<TE>   By then, his wife, Janet, trailing 5-year-old twins Erica and
Emily, and her son, Larry, 10, had caught up with him in time to snap
family photos with an obliging Robitaille.</TE>
<TE>   It was then that Dave Knapp placed his trembling fingertips on
hockey's Holy Grail.</TE>
<TE>   "I all but kissed it and cried in it," he said.</TE>

<HD>Senator Pays Price for Defying GOP</HD>
<DH>Politics: K. Maurice Johannessen is being shunned after
casting swing vote on budget.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Since he cast the lone Republican vote needed to approve a state
budget in the Senate nearly two months ago, Sen. K. Maurice
Johannessen of Redding has been booted from his party caucus and
stripped of his leadership role.</LD>
<LD>   He is no longer welcome at GOP lunches. He's not provided official
copies of party briefing papers on upcoming bills. And today, when
members of the Senate pause to give a send-off to Johannessen, who is
termed out, Republicans are not expected to speak up for him.</LD>
<LD>   All of that has made the 68-year-old lawmaker nicknamed "Mojo" a
walking warning sign of what can happen to a legislator who breaks
ranks, particularly in the increasingly tense brinksmanship over the
long-stalled budget. Defy leadership, Mojo's plight attests, and
isolation can be the price.</LD>
<TE>   "When you get into a real budget battle, it becomes a test of
character," said Sen. Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside). "Maurice didn't
measure up. It becomes an issue of integrity and trust."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Johannessen says he has no regrets over his decision to
vote for the budget, a vote he said he cast because he was convinced
it was best for his constituents and for California. His district
cuts through the middle of the state from the outer reaches of the
Bay Area on up to the Oregon border, covering many of Northern
California's rural communities.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a conservative," Johannessen said. "But I am not a
demagogue."</TE>
<TE>   Johannessen's unwillingness to stick with his party leadership was
evident in his recent vote to approve a $99-billion spending package
that includes about $4 billion in new taxes and other revenues.
Johannessen's vote gave Democrats just the number they needed to pass
the budget out of the Senate and back to the Assembly, where it
remains stuck.</TE>
<TE>   It was not the first time Johannessen voted for a budget that his
fellow Republicans opposed. He played a crucial role last year in
passing a budget that contained a quarter-cent sales tax increase.
His vote helped Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) move the
spending package onto the desk of Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   His conservative colleagues pinpoint that act as the moment when
they began to have serious misgivings about Johannessen.</TE>
<TE>   Morrow recalled that before voting for the budget last year,
Johannessen had encouraged his fellow Senate Republicans to fight for
a key list of GOP priorities. But in the end, Morrow said, it was
Johannessen who gave Democrats the decisive vote they needed to
approve the plan.</TE>
<TE>   When Johannessen repeated the act this year, Morrow and his
conservative counterparts moved swiftly to oust him from their caucus
and remove him as assistant leader.</TE>
<TE>   Johannessen disputes Morrow's portrayal of events and contends
that in both cases he voted for the budget only after his caucus
failed to propose solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Burton says the Republican banishment of Johannessen is
"unworthy."</TE>
<TE>   "He put his people and his district ahead of his party," Burton
said. "Where I come from that's not necessarily a sin. He's always
been an independent guy."</TE>
<TE>   Johannessen bargained for his budget votes, securing deals on
issues he cared about and nabbing plums for his district.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, he got money for rural law enforcement
programs and extracted some concessions on taxes. Closer to home,
Johannessen got the support of Democrats for construction of a
veterans home in his hometown of Redding. That was an important coup
for Johannessen, a Korean War vet and chairman of the Senate Veterans
Affairs Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Johannessen counts the number of bills dealing with veterans
affairs that he has managed to pass in his nine-year stint in the
Senate as edging somewhere close to 40--an accomplishment he credits
to his ability to work with Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm more people-oriented than some of my colleagues would like me
to be," he said during an interview last week in his Senate office.
The room is decorated with photos of Johannessen and Republican
leaders, along with one of him and Gov. Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Establishing a veterans home in Redding will allow vets who hail
from his district to receive more visits from nearby family members.
The same goes for a veterans cemetery, he added, that has broken
ground in his district.</TE>
<TE>   Johannessen says he is proud of the achievements, and he is quick
to respond to his Republican critics. There's a news ticker running
across his Senate Web site that reads: "Senate Republicans Cover Up
True Budget Negotiation Intentions."</TE>
<TE>   The headline leads to a lengthy essay by Johannessen in which he
contends that he was booted from his caucus in retaliation for his
vote on the budget. He also laments the old days when lawmakers from
both sides of the aisle came together to work through difficult
issues.</TE>
<TE>   He contends his negotiations were carried out with the silent
approval of GOP leaders and that he's been made to be the party fall
guy.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe the Republican Caucus should have cast one more vote before
they left town and voted themselves hypocrites of the year," he
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Caucus Whip Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside) describes those events
differently. Haynes said Johannessen wasn't ousted for voting for the
budget, but rather for negotiating with Democrats outside the caucus.</TE>
<TE>   Had Johannessen stuck with the caucus, Haynes contends, Democrats
would have been forced to negotiate with GOP leaders from both houses
on a compromise spending package.</TE>
<TE>   What has happened instead, Haynes explained, is that after the
Democrats who control the Capitol secured the one Republican vote
needed to approve the budget in the Senate, they embarked on a
similar approach in the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   So far the approach has failed, resulting in the continuing
standoff.</TE>
<TE>   "He essentially neutered all 13 of us because he cut the deal on
his own," Haynes said. "He got everything he wanted, and we all got
screwed. If Mojo had stuck with us, we could have had a budget."</TE>
<TE>   Johannessen, who was born in Oslo and entered the United States
1952 by leaving a merchant ship docked in San Pedro, said he is not
bothered by his exclusion. The caucus lunches, for instances, he said
he can do without.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes we had some pretty good Frank Fat's food, but other
than that, I don't miss it at all," said the senator.</TE>
<TE>   As for no longer receiving the bill analyses prepared by the
Senate Republican fiscal staff, Johannessen said he does not need
them. Besides, he added, other caucus members have offered to let him
look at their copies.</TE>
<TE>   "They're still my friends," he said of most. "A couple of them
won't talk to me. I suppose they really believe that politics is more
important than policy."</TE>
<TE>   Even Haynes, who has expressed disappointment with Johannessen's
votes, acknowledges that he likes him. Still, politics requires
loyalty, Haynes said, and Johannessen has not measured up.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to play football, and I understand the concept of a team,"
Haynes said. "The biggest deal in a team is when a play is called,
everyone runs the same play. Senate Republicans lost the game because
Mojo called his own play. In those instances, the rest of the team
says, 'Try and run the ball on your own' ."</TE>

<HD>Group Drops Suit Over the Poisoning of Anacapa Island Rats</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Agreement will allow independent monitoring of
the park service's efforts to eradicate the rodents to protect a rare
bird.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RODNEY BOSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An animal advocacy group has dropped a lawsuit against the National
Park Service in exchange for the opportunity to independently observe
the eradication of Anacapa Island's black rat population.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based Fund for Animals was seeking to appeal a
federal district judge's decision last year that allowed the park
service to disperse poisoned grain pellets on the East Anacapa islet
in the first phase of an eradication program.</LD>
<LD>   Park service officials maintain that the eradication of black rats
from the three islets that make up Anacapa Island is necessary to
save the rare Xantus' murrelet from extinction. The black rats prey
upon the bird's eggs and chicks, said Kate Faulkner, chief of natural
resources management for Channel Islands National Park.</LD>
<TE>   The advocacy group, joined in the lawsuit by the Channel Islands
Animal Protection Assn., contends the rats do not pose a threat to
the birds, and poisoning them also indiscriminately kills other
species of animals and birds.</TE>
<TE>   Announcing its agreement with the park service last week, the
advocacy group said it was victorious in shedding light on a program
with no oversight.</TE>
<TE>   "One of our complaints with Phase 1 is that there was no
independent monitoring of what was happening," said Michael
Markarian, executive vice president of the Fund for Animals. "By
having independent review of what is happening to dead and dying
animals, there is more accountability and transparency in this
project."</TE>
<TE>   Along with killing off black rats, the first phase of the
eradication effort killed nearly 50 birds from 11 different species,
Faulkner said. Markarian's group argues that the number was probably
far greater, therefore the need for independent review during Phase 2
of the project.</TE>
<TE>   Markarian said the agreement also will force the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service to conduct a new environmental assessment before
proceeding with the second and final phase of the $700,000
eradication program. But Faulkner said a second assessment would have
been completed regardless of the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no roadblock to us moving ahead even without the
settlement," Faulkner said. "There is just a lot of work involved
when you've got a court action."</TE>
<TE>   Faulkner said Phase 2 will proceed in November or December,
depending on weather conditions. Anacapa's middle and west islets
will be showered with bait by helicopter and by hand along the
shoreline. Efforts to eradicate the black rat population from the
East Anacapa islet were successful, Faulkner said.</TE>
<TE>   "We can now look at what has been the biological response," she
said. "Do we have the scene of death and destruction that the
plaintiffs alleged or not? We do not."</TE>
<TE>   Faulkner said the black rat eradication on East Anacapa also
served to preserve populations of certain reptiles and amphibians.
Twice as many side-blotched lizards and Channel Islands slender
salamanders were observed during a springtime population count on
East Anacapa compared to populations observed on Middle Anacapa,
Faulkner said.</TE>
<TE>   "In prior years, [the counts] were very similar," she said. "The
difference is, we removed rats."</TE>
<TE>   The rat eradication is part of an ongoing program at Channel
Islands National Park to return native flora and fauna to the
islands, but the methodology has drawn the ire of a variety of
environmental groups.</TE>
<TE>   "As human beings, I think we may try to interfere too much to
return ecosystems to look aesthetically pleasing to us," Markarian
said. "Humans are certainly the most nonnative species that you could
have added, and we're not getting rid of ourselves. We're just
saying, 'Let's just have a little more perspective.' "</TE>

<HD>Cal State Channel Islands Is a Reality</HD>
<DH>Education: The campus opens today as Ventura County's
first public four-year university.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN and FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just six years ago, what is now America's newest public university
was the glimmer of an idea: The still-nameless school had no campus,
no faculty, no academic mission--not even a mascot.</LD>
<LD>   The idea of a four-year school in Ventura County had been
glimmering, in fact, for more than 30 years, and was all but snuffed
several times for lack of land.</LD>
<LD>   Today, California State University Channel Islands finally opens
to 750 students on the lush grounds of a former state mental hospital
near Camarillo. Its creation is a lesson in imagination and
perseverance involving community groups hungry for higher education
and academic pioneers eager to build a school from scratch.</LD>
<TE>   Even after the site was lined up, putting together the school
wasn't easy</TE>
<TE>   "It's like having a baby. Theoretically, you know what should
happen. It's not until the labor starts that you say, 'Oh, my God!'
But in the end, what you have is something wonderful," said Professor
Louise Lutze-Mann, chairwoman of the university's Academic Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Channel Islands, even after a state investment so far of more than
$70 million, remains very much a work in progress. Over the next 15
years, it is expected to swell to 20,000 students and add residence
halls, sports teams and other trappings of an established school.</TE>
<TE>   Already, though, the university boasts a faculty that includes 30
tenured or tenure-track professors who have come from such far-flung
locales as Australia's University of New South Wales and Harvard
University's medical school. Cal State Channel Islands will begin
with eight bachelor's degree programs and a teacher credentialing
program, a boon in a state starved for teachers.</TE>
<TE>   There's an alma mater, composed by one of the school's
administrators: "From the islands to the mountains, to the mighty
shore, Cal State Channel Islands shall stand for ever more." And
there's even an acronym: CSUCI, which, to the chagrin of many of the
school's gung-ho backers, often is pronounced "sushi."</TE>
<TE>   The effort to open a public university in Ventura County, long the
state's largest county without one, was fueled by concern over the
low number of students pursuing four-year college degrees. The latest
figures show only 13.3% of recent high school graduates in the county
attending Cal State or University of California schools, well below
the statewide average of 17.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Although the school hopes to draw out-of-town students, it is
intended mainly to serve county residents, many of them Latino and
working adults, who can't manage to attend college away from home.</TE>
<TE>   "Northridge is quite a distance for us ... and [UC Santa Barbara]
is even farther," said Tina Hurly, a 37-year-old Oxnard mother who
recently enrolled at Channel Islands to finish her bachelor's degree
and earn a teaching credential. "We didn't have ... access, until
now."</TE>
<TE>   Like any new university, Cal State Channel Islands' first
obstacle--and the one that most hindered its progress for three
decades--was finding land. Gov. Pat Brown approved the school, in
concept, in 1965. But it seemed that every time a potential site was
identified, environmental concerns, anti-growth sentiment or other
roadblocks thwarted the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the fledgling school got a break. In the late '90s, after
Camarillo State Hospital closed, the state handed over the property,
free, to the Cal State system.</TE>
<TE>   The 600-plus-acre site--with its elegant Spanish-style
architecture, gardens and 30 or so courtyards, surrounded by fertile
farmland against the backdrop of the Santa Monica Mountains--was a
natural for conversion into a pastoral college campus.</TE>
<TE>   Although a new campus offers the comparatively unfettered freedom
to develop new courses, curriculum and programs, it also requires an
enormous amount of work, some of it tedious, under tight deadlines.</TE>
<TE>   "None of the things that one becomes accustomed to in an
established institution are there," said Richard R. Rush, a
soft-spoken Los Angeles native who returned to Southern California to
become president of the Channel Islands campus. "Alumni, students,
relationships, technology, a catalog.... Here, we had to create
everything."</TE>
<TE>   To sell the idea of a new school, the Cal State system turned in
1996 to J. Handel Evans, a British-born, 30-year veteran of the
university system known for his political savvy. Evans, named the
school's planning president, was fresh from a similar assignment
converting the former Ft. Ord Army base into Cal State Monterey Bay.
The school opened in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Evans sought backers at Rotary Club meetings, business luncheons
and community forums. He lined up lawmakers to press the case in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   One of the pivotal legislative victories involved creation of an
entrepreneurial alliance between the university and local governments
to build 900 houses and apartments on the school's property. Revenues
from the home sales and apartment rentals will help fund university
expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Evans was deft at putting the touch on private contributors, who
so far have pledged $17 million.</TE>
<TE>   While courting Oxnard rancher Jack Broome for a $5-million library
pledge, for example, Evans zeroed in on the philanthropist's interest
in aviation and his enthusiasm for the American Air Museum in
Duxford, England. Evans promised to try to hire the museum's
designer, prominent British architect Sir Norman Foster. He succeeded
in hiring Foster and in captivating Broome.</TE>
<TE>   "His enthusiasm, and his wife Carol's, is very contagious," Broome
said. "I just got caught up in what they wanted to do."</TE>
<TE>   Construction is due to begin next spring on the library, on a spot
where the state hospital once operated a morgue and surgery rooms.</TE>
<TE>   For Evans, the outpouring of public support culminated in the fall
of 1997. Dozens of university boosters--including farmers, local
politicians and business leaders wearing red-and-white buttons that
read "Yes! CSUCI YES!"--traveled by bus to Long Beach to urge Cal
State trustees to convert the grounds of the shuttered mental
hospital into a college campus.</TE>
<TE>   The trustees, some of whom had publicly questioned the level of
community support for the campus, stood and gave the backers a
standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Next, Evans took steps to develop a campus culture. He turned to
picking a mascot, a decision that can set the tone for a school (UC
Santa Cruz Banana Slugs) and at times, land it in hot water (San
Diego State's Aztec symbol, Monty Montezuma). The decision was left
to students then at the satellite campus of Cal State Northridge,
launched in 1974 in Ventura and moved to the current Channel Islands
site three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Competition was fierce. There were nominations tapping Ventura
County's agricultural and industrial roots, including the oilers,
drillers and farmers. And many more drawing from the county's coastal
influences: the sea lion and sea otter, the waves and the surfers.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the idea of a dolphin bubbled to the surface, and by
March 1999, hundreds of Ventura campus students signed petitions
championing the name. Now, there are diving dolphins atop each page
of the university's first schedule of classes, smiling dolphins on
pennants lining office walls and glass dolphins for sale at the
university's cafe.</TE>
<TE>   With the plans for the physical campus largely in place, Evans,
now 64, stepped aside last year. He was replaced by Rush, 60, who
dived into the monumental task of hiring the first round of
tenure-track professors.</TE>
<TE>   The school was flooded with 2,300 applications for the 25
advertised faculty openings.</TE>
<TE>   Rush insisted on interviewing in person all of the 65 to 70 final
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   During the height of the hiring process, he still was finishing up
his work as president of Minnesota State University at Mankato, so he
flew in for two three-day weekends and interviewed one candidate
after another, in 10-to 12-hour stretches.</TE>
<TE>   The long hours left him with back spasms, but Rush filled 13 of
the openings. He was confident that his hires had the talent he
sought, and the collegiality and enthusiasm necessary for working
well with students and across disciplines.</TE>
<TE>   "People asked if they could come early and get started," Rush
said.</TE>
<TE>   In a second round of hiring this summer, the university offered
tenured or tenure-track positions to 19 more candidates, and all but
two accepted.</TE>
<TE>   "The vast majority are risk-takers," said Kevin Volkan, a
psychology professor who joined the faculty last year. "They're kind
of like CEOs who go off and start new companies."</TE>
<TE>   Volkan, 43, a Bay Area native who previously was an administrator
and lecturer at Harvard University's medical school, this year will
teach such courses as "Psychology and Traditional Asian Thought'' and
"Psychology of Art and Artists."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a new place; we can really try to do something
different,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rush gave the faculty a Dec. 1 deadline to produce the school's
full catalog of classes and policies.</TE>
<TE>   To keep track of everything that needed to be done, the initial
chairman of the Academic Senate, economist Dennis Muraoka, posted
dozens of paper notes in the faculty's conference room on a panel
covered with a sticky fabric. It came to be known, with some dread,
as "the green wall."</TE>
<TE>   Professors mulled a degree program in "languages and cultures" but
dismissed it as too ill-defined. They adopted a more traditional
English degree program.</TE>
<TE>   But they also got adventurous.</TE>
<TE>   One of the boldest moves was to launch a master's degree program,
which will start in 2004, in bioinformatics, which will focus on
decoding genetic information, blending biology, computer science and
math.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of flexibility is rare at established schools, said
Ching-Hua Wang, a biology professor, who came to Channel Islands
after 11 years at Cal State San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   "You have territories and you have interests to protect. It's very
difficult for [faculties] to work together," Wang said. "Here, we
don't have that kind formal structure yet." As the opening day
approached, activity on campus heated up again.</TE>
<TE>   Six orientation sessions were held for batches of entering
students. University staff organized a formal opening ceremony Aug.
16 that attracted at least 1,000 attendees, including Gov. Gray
Davis. Efforts to hire the last of the nearly 40 to 45 part-time
teachers continued.</TE>
<TE>   Yet through it all--the hassles and the accomplishments--a sense
of excitement prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   "With the help of a wonderful, embracing community, we have
created the newest public university in the United States," said
Ginger Reyes, 24, an outreach and recruitment counselor who spoke at
the grand opening ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "Now how cool is that?''</TE>

<HD>Ex-O.C. Official Back in Politics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six years after leaving politics amid the turmoil of Orange County's
bankruptcy, former Supervisor Roger R. Stanton is throwing his hat
back in the ring.</LD>
<LD>   Stanton is running for a seat on the Fountain Valley City Council,
where he got his political start nearly 30 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The 65-year-old Cal State Long Beach business management
professor, once one of Orange County's rising political stars, said
he doesn't see Fountain Valley as a springboard for higher office. In
fact, he said he would serve only one four-year term.</LD>
<TE>   "The mistake people make when they get into politics is that they
let their ego get out of control," Stanton said. "But if you just
think about how you can make a contribution--and I think I can make a
contribution in this small, quiet community--there's a blessing in
obscurity."</TE>
<TE>   Stanton carries high name recognition--a park in nearby Midway
City is named after him--but also some political baggage. He was on
the Orange County Board of Supervisors in 1994 when the county lost
$1.7 billion through bad investments and plunged into bankruptcy.
Stanton and fellow Supervisor William G. Steiner faced civil charges
by the district attorney's office for failing to prevent the
financial collapse. But the charges were dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a bit surprised he's running for office," said Cal State
Fullerton political science professor Alan Saltzstein. "He was on the
county board when it was going through tough times dealing with the
problems of the bankruptcy. You had to take a lot of abuse, lay off a
lot of people, and get yelled and screamed at. If it were me, I'd be
tired of public office, so it's to his credit that he still wants to
run for office."</TE>
<TE>   Stanton, however, said he is rested and ready to give elected
office another try.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a refreshing break to be out of politics," said Stanton,
who served on the council from 1974 to 1981. "But I'm still
interested in public policy."</TE>
<TE>   In papers Stanton filed to run for a council seat, he makes no
direct mention of his tenure on the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was restricted to 200 words and instead chose to allude
to his "past performance [that] earned him strong support from county
public safety agencies."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just a plain, ordinary citizen who is an educator and just
interested in the community, and I wouldn't embellish it beyond
that," Stanton said.</TE>
<TE>   Stanton plans to continue teaching at Cal State Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Stanton said he wants to work on issues of concern to him. He
favors more prudent use of redevelopment funds, saying a $700,000
water fountain in front of City Hall is excessive.</TE>
<TE>   He wants to develop programs to encourage more youths to enter
politics and will work to improve senior services, transportation and
water quality. He backs term limits and opposes cyber cafes.</TE>
<TE>   Stanton still hopes to make a difference in the city where he's
lived 32 years.</TE>
<TE>   But he's also bracing for the public's reaction to his election
bid.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the risk you take running for office," Stanton said. "I'm
not running for the county board; I'm running for a council seat in a
mid-size city. Obviously, there will be people who want to take their
best shot, but you can't be afraid to raise your hand in politics at
any level."</TE>
<TE>   Stanton is running against Tom Holmberg, William Bohrk, Cheryl
Brothers, Guy Carrozzo, John Collins and Sam Lew.</TE>

<HD>3 Killed as Van Full of Immigrants Flips</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three men were killed and at least eight others were injured when a
van packed with undocumented immigrants rolled over and split open on
Interstate 10 in Indio, the California Highway Patrol said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "There were close to 20 people in this van when it rolled over,
causing a catastrophic failure of its roof," CHP Sgt. Paul Crescenti
said of the accident late Saturday night. "The roof split open from
close to the front window to the back doors, throwing one man out."</LD>
<LD>   Crescenti said investigators determined that the occupants entered
the United States from Mexico on foot somewhere near Mexicali and
then waited to be picked up by the white Dodge van.</LD>
<TE>   Shortly after 10:30 p.m., the driver lost control of the van and
it struck another vehicle, went down a slight embankment and rolled
over. One man, Crescenti said, died when he was tossed out through
the split roof. Two other men were killed inside the van.</TE>
<TE>   Crescenti said the investigation into the cause of the crash was
ongoing, but that the combined weight of the occupants is believed to
have been a factor.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedics took eight victims to nearby hospitals. Three males
were pronounced dead at the scene, according to the Riverside County
coroner's office. The identifications are pending, officials said.
All are believed to be Mexican citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Crescenti said CHP investigators had not yet determined who was
driving the van.</TE>
<TE>   Since the crash, Indio police and CHP officers have found several
more passengers roaming in the surrounding agricultural area,
Crescenti said. One man had been injured and was hospitalized.</TE>

<LD>Representatives of the Oxnard Harbor District and the Port of

this week to resolve differences as they negotiate a new three-year
contact.</LD>
<LD>   Port officials have scheduled meetings with Service Employees
International Union, Local 998 on Tuesday and Wednesday. Along with
higher wages, the union wants an enhanced pension plan and a
continuation of full health benefits for future retirees who have
worked at least five years. "I am fully confident that we can wrap
this up next week," said Ellyn Dembowski, the local's deputy
director.</LD>
<LD>   William J. Buenger, port executive director, said he was
optimistic enough about making progress that he agreed to schedule
consecutive meetings.</LD>

<HD>Costa Mesa Man to Share in $122-Million Prize</HD>
<DH>Lottery: Aerospace engineer buys one of the four winning
tickets worth $30.5 million. Officials confirm he's an 'apparent
winner,' subject to verification.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County aerospace worker appears to have one of the four
lucky lottery tickets that matched the winning numbers in Saturday's
$122-million Super Lotto Plus jackpot drawing, state lottery
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Russell Norsby of Costa Mesa was declared an "apparent winner''
after a preliminary review showed his ticket matched the winning
numbers, said Herman Dustman, a California Lottery spokesman and
sales manager in Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   Norsby bought his ticket last week at the Circle K at 1654 Santa
Ana Ave. in Costa Mesa and returned to the store early Sunday
morning, Dustman said. At the store, he was issued a claim receipt
showing he had a ticket with winning numbers, 6, 9, 17, 27 and 35,
and the Mega number, 24, Dustman said.</LD>
<TE>   Before being declared an official winner, Norsby is required to
fill out a claim form at a state lottery office and the ticket must
undergo the standard verification, Dustman said.</TE>
<TE>   Norsby's share of the jackpot is expected to be $30.5 million. A
hefty 27% of the sum will be paid in federal income taxes, lottery
officials said. Even so, Norsby won a piece of the third-largest
lottery jackpot in California.</TE>
<TE>   "He was shaking like a leaf. It was just starting to sink in,"
Dustman said Sunday. "His wife was in tears."</TE>
<TE>   The other winning tickets were bought in Rosemead in Los Angeles
County, San Marcos in San Diego County and Brisbane in San Mateo
County in the Bay Area. The ticket in Rosemead was purchased at Casa
de Liquor, 2525 N. San Gabriel Blvd., according to lottery officials.</TE>
<TE>   Norsby, 62, is expected to complete a claim form today at the
lottery office.</TE>
<TE>   He has three children.</TE>
<TE>   Kuljit Singh, a Circle K cashier, said Norsby is a regular at the
convenience store, which is just blocks from a commercial area in
central Orange County. "He comes in here all the time--but not
usually with a winning ticket like this one,'' Singh said. "We've
never had a winner before."</TE>
<TE>   Norsby, a quiet, unassuming man, stood in line Sunday morning to
tell Circle K employees that he believed he had a winning ticket.
Asked whether he will go to work today, Norsby said "most probably."</TE>
<TE>   Lottery officials said the store would receive $150,000, which is
a half-percent of the winning ticket sold.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Oakland Athletics found a different way to get the job done
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Athletics won their 12th consecutive game, rallying from a
five-run deficit to beat the Tigers, 10-7, at Detroit. Oakland
maintained its two-game lead in the American League West.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Chavez and John Mabry hit two-run doubles in a decisive
five-run eighth inning. The Athletics' winning streak is their
longest since they set an Oakland record with a 14-game string in
1988.</LD>
<TE>   The Tigers lost their fifth consecutive game. Randall Simon hit a
grand slam that gave Detroit a 7-2 lead in the fourth and tied a
career high with five runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't look good early," said Chavez, whose broken-bat double
down the right-field line off Jamie Walker (1-1) brought the A's to
within one run before Mabry's pinch-hit double off Juan Acevedo put
the A's ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "But we battled back and stayed in it. It was a different win but
it was a good win," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers loaded the bases with one out in the ninth against
Billy Koch. But Koch struck out pinch-hitter Wendell Magee and
Brandon Inge for his 33rd save in 38 chances.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 12, Cleveland 4--Ben Davis homered twice, including a
grand slam, and Freddy Garcia pitched eight strong innings to lead
the Mariners at Cleveland. Bret Boone had four hits and three RBIs
for Seattle, which scored eight runs by the third inning. The
Mariners lost the first two games of the series on game-winning home
runs.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia (14-9) settled down after a rough first inning to get his
first road win since June 19. The right-hander went eight innings for
the first time in 10 starts.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 6, New York 2--Rookie Joaquin Benoit held the high-powered
Yankee offense scoreless until the seventh to lead the Rangers at New
York. Alex Rodriguez drove in his major league-leading 113th run,
Michael Young had two RBIs and Herbert Perry homered for the Rangers,
who won for the seventh time in 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, Baltimore 2--Josh Phelps homered as the Blue Jays won
at Baltimore. Baltimore's Mike Bordick broke Cal Ripken's major
league record for consecutive errorless chances by a shortstop,
throwing out leadoff hitter Shannon Stewart on a grounder in the
first inning to run his string to 429.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 4, Minnesota 2--Chuck Knoblauch hit a leadoff home run
and Michael Tucker and Raul Ibanez also hit solo shots as the Royals
won at Kansas City, Mo., to snap a six-game home losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 8, Tampa Bay 3--Gary Glover gave up four hits through
seven innings for the White Sox at Chicago. Tampa Bay has gone a
club-record 16 straight series without winning one.</TE>

<HD>Angels' Ninth Symphony</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Three pinch-hitters and a pinch-runner lead
Angels to five runs in final inning of 8-3 win over Boston.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The home team proudly features a collection of guys everyone knows by
one name--Pedro, Nomar and Manny.</LD>
<LD>   The visiting team proudly features a collection of guys known only
to friends, family and obsessed fantasy league players.</LD>
<LD>   There is a team approaching panic mode here, and it is not the
Angels.</LD>
<TE>   The Boston Red Sox held back the great Pedro Martinez so he could
pitch against the Angels. They milked 17-game winner Derek Lowe for a
season-high 121 pitches Sunday in a futile effort to beat the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   But the Angels produced perhaps their most delightful inning of
the season, with a pinch-runner and three pinch-hitters sparking a
five-run rally in the ninth inning, to earn an 8-3 victory and ensure
that Boston would gain no ground on them during this series.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels remained percentage points ahead of the Seattle
Mariners in the American League wild-card race. The Red Sox already
have played their aces in Martinez and Lowe, and they would tumble 4
1/2 games behind the Angels if they lose the series finale tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a different feel than it was at the beginning of the year,"
the Angels' Benji Gil said. "Other teams are realizing we're a team
they have to contend with."</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox, the team with the $110-million payroll and the one
that inflated its budget to acquire Cliff Floyd and Bobby Howry at
the trading deadline, started Lowe on Sunday. The Angels, the team
with the $60-million payroll and a sharp eye on the waiver wire,
started Mickey Callaway, discarded by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels used every position player. The heroes included Gil,
who couldn't get a major league call-up during two years in the
Florida Marlin organization, independent league refugee Shawn Wooten
and Chone Figgins, whose career with the Colorado Rockies stalled at
double A.</TE>
<TE>   Backup outfielders Orlando Palmeiro and Alex Ochoa, sharing the
No. 3 spot Sunday in the absence of injured star Tim Salmon, combined
to drive in four runs. The relievers wore No. 53 and No. 60.</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, fans scour the box scores and scratch their
heads. These guys--whoever they are--are spooking the Red Sox?</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter what the rest of the country thinks," center
fielder Darin Erstad said.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied, 3-3, after eight innings and Boston closer
Ugueth Urbina ready, Red Sox Manager Grady Little gambled that he
could squeeze another inning out of Lowe, who already had given up a
season-high 11 hits. By that time, with the score tied after eight, a
save situation was no longer possible for Urbina, but Little left him
in the bullpen anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Bad call. Meanwhile, every call Angel Manager Mike Scioscia made
was golden.</TE>
<TE>   After Scott Spiezio singled to start the ninth, Scioscia tapped
Figgins for his major league debut, as a pinch-runner. Just the other
day, Scioscia had asked General Manager Bill Stoneman for a
pinch-runner, and so the Angels promoted Figgins from triple A.</TE>
<TE>   After Adam Kennedy struck out, Wooten batted for Jose Molina.
Little called for two pitchouts; Scioscia held Figgins both times.
Wooten then singled to left field, and Figgins sped from first to
third.</TE>
<TE>   David Eckstein followed, and Little did not pitch out. Another bad
call, since Scioscia called for the squeeze on the first pitch.
Eckstein bunted back to Lowe, but Figgins was a blur as he scored
what turned out to be the deciding run.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have to put down a perfect bunt," Eckstein said,
"because he just flies."</TE>
<TE>   Lowe was done, but Scioscia was not. Ochoa pinch-hit and singled
home two runs. Gil pinch-hit and tripled home two more.</TE>
<TE>   And, with a five-run lead, Scioscia left closer Troy Percival in
the bullpen and allowed No. 60--Scott Schoeneweis--to finish the
victory, and to receive the congratulatory handshakes that follow.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't really know what to do," he said. "I didn't know who to
high-five first."</TE>

<HD>Callaway Makes a Striking Return</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>One and done? If players strike Friday and do not return this season,
Mickey Callaway's triumphant return to the major leagues will not be
followed by an encore.</LD>
<LD>   In his first major league start in three years, pitching in a
pennant race and against a Cy Young Award contender, Callaway
neutralized Derek Lowe and the Boston Red Sox.</LD>
<LD>   Callaway received no decision, but he recovered from a rocky start
and held the Red Sox to two earned runs over six innings.</LD>
<TE>   Callaway, 27, promoted from triple-A Salt Lake to replace the
injured Aaron Sele, arrived in Boston on Saturday and figured a good
night's sleep would be in order. He turned out the lights at 10 p.m.,
but a good night's sleep eluded him.</TE>
<TE>   "The last time I looked at the clock, it was 2:30," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With adrenaline substituting for rest, he did fine. He did not
appear long for the game in the first inning; third baseman Troy
Glaus made a terrific play for the first out, but the next four
batters reached base. With one run in, one out and the bases loaded,
Brian Daubach grounded into a double play.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I could get a ground ball in that situation, and I did,"
Callaway said. "My confidence was high the whole time."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels acquired him from the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for minor
league infielder Wilmy Caceres last December, not that anyone noticed
at the time. Callaway had spent all or part of the previous four
seasons in triple A, and "Devil Ray discard" is not a coveted label.</TE>
<TE>   But since he made his major league debut for the Devil Rays in
1999, Callaway said he has evolved from a pitcher who throws mostly
fastballs and the occasional sinker to one who mixes a fastball,
sinker, split-finger and changeup and works the corners of the strike
zone. He credited Joe Coleman, a former Angel pitching coach now
working for the Devil Rays, with teaching him the new pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Callaway is scheduled to start again Friday, the day the players'
union set as its strike date. If there is no strike, Callaway could
remain in the rotation through September.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Angels hope Sele can strengthen his partially torn
rotator cuff and return within three weeks, Manager Mike Scioscia
acknowledged Sunday that the Angels aren't counting on it.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a big piece of our rotation for the next couple of years,"
Scioscia said. "We don't want to jeopardize a guy's career."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Uhlich, the Angels' senior vice president of business
operations, said the team has discussed contingency plans in the
event of a strike but does not anticipate any layoffs among the
approximately 150 full-time employees in the front office.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those employees--in areas such as finance and human
resources--work for both the Angels and Disney's other sports team,
the Mighty Ducks. If a strike becomes lengthy, Uhlich said the
Angels' sales and marketing employees could be deployed on behalf of
the Ducks. The Ducks had the lowest attendance in the NHL next
season.</TE>
<TE>   The strike would hit game-day employees the hardest. Those
vendors, ushers, parking attendants and ticket takers are typically
adults in need of a second income beyond their full-time job or
senior citizens whose only employment is part-time.</TE>
<TE>   "When we don't have an event, they don't work," Uhlich said.
"That's unfortunate."</TE>
<TE>   Other than not using game-day employees, he said the Angels have
limited flexibility in cutting costs during a short strike. Most of
the advertising budget has been spent for this season, the minor
league seasons end this week, and the modest expense of keeping
scouts home from major league games in September pales in comparison
to the money already spent in sending scouts to high school, college,
minor league and major league games the rest of the year.</TE>

<LD>In need of pitching help, the St. Louis Cardinals acquired
left-handed reliever Jeff Fassero from the Chicago Cubs for two minor
leaguers to be named and cash on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Cardinals lead the National League Central by three games over
Houston.</LD>
<LD>   Fassero, 39, is 5-6 with a 6.18 earned-run average in 51 innings.</LD>
<TE>   On Saturday, the Cardinals put starter Matt Morris and left-hander
reliever Mike Matthews on the disabled list. The Cardinals have
already added right-hander Rick White and left-handed Nerio Rodriguez
to their staff.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Sosa, bothered by a sore neck, returned to Chicago and
missed the Cubs' series finale against the Arizona Diamondbacks on
Sunday. The Cubs said the injury was not believed to be serious.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs also activated right-handed reliever Juan Cruz and
optioned right-hander Steve Smyth to triple-A Iowa. Cruz had been on
the 15-day disabled list since Aug. 10 because of a right arm strain.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Toronto Blue Jays activated Carlos Delgado from the 15-day
disabled list. The first baseman had been sidelined since Aug. 8
because of lower back tightness.</TE>
<TE>   To make room for Delgado on the 25-man active roster, the Blue
Jays put right-hander Luke Prokopec on the disabled list because of
an elbow injury. Toronto also optioned outfielder Pedro Swann to
triple-A Syracuse and recalled right-hander Brian Bowles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Baltimore Orioles put outfielder Gary Matthews Jr. on the
15-day disabled list because of tendinitis in his right wrist.... The
Chicago White Sox put infielder Tony Graffanino on the 15-day
disabled list because of an injured right knee.</TE>

<LD>Bill Caplan is going into the World Boxing Hall of Fame.</LD>
<LD>   Bill who?</LD>
<LD>   Boxing fans will nod in recognition at the rest of the inductees
in the class of 2002. Who doesn't know George Foreman, the former
two-time heavyweight champion, or Mike McCallum, who won world titles
in three weight classes, or former junior-featherweight and
bantamweight champion Lupe Pintor, or former flyweight champion
Miguel Canto?</LD>
<TE>   Anybody familiar with the sport has heard of trainer Freddie Roach
or seen television analyst Larry Merchant, who were elected in the
expanded category.</TE>
<TE>   But Caplan?</TE>
<TE>   The public may not know him well, if at all, but media
representatives in this town and many others know Caplan very
well--have known him for 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   Too well, sometimes.</TE>
<TE>   If you have a phone, if you have a mailing address, if you have an
e-mail address, if there is a restaurant you frequent--especially a
restaurant--Caplan will find you and talk to you and plead with you
and wine you and whine to you until you give his fighter of the
moment space in your paper or time on your station, or just a mere
mention. Publicity, the driving force in boxing, is also the driving
force in Caplan's life.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1962, he has been a promoter, matchmaker, ring announcer and
part-time actor with credits in a dozen movies. But mostly, he has
been a publicist for everybody from Foreman to Butterbean.</TE>
<TE>   Starting at the Top</TE>
<TE>   In 1957, Caplan and Sandy, his pregnant wife of less than a year,
set out for California to seek their fortune after the family bakery
in Des Moines, Iowa, had been sold.</TE>
<TE>   They were desperately in need of some fortune. Their funds were so
thin, Sandy had to leave her watch as collateral at a service station
along the way when they ran low on gas.</TE>
<TE>   After arriving in Southern California, the Caplans coasted the
final hundred yards to the Baldwin Hills home of Bill's sister, Ruth
Rummans, because the car was again out of gas.</TE>
<TE>   But Ruth's husband, Larry, changed Caplan's career prospects.
Rummans was a widely known figure in local boxing. He was the West
Coast representative for Sugar Ray Robinson and managed fighters
backed by, among others, Frank Sinatra.</TE>
<TE>   Rummans got Caplan his first publicity job for a promoter named
Joe Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, that Joe Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Louis promoted several fight cards in Los Angeles in the early
'60s. He liked having the young, energetic Caplan around. He just
couldn't remember his name, only his connection to Rummans. So Louis
called Caplan simply "brother-in-law."</TE>
<TE>   Hair Today, Fame and Fortune Tomorrow</TE>
<TE>   Caplan went on to work for Aileen Eaton and George Parnassus, two
of the biggest names in L.A. boxing. Over the years, Caplan has also
worked for everybody from Don King to Bob Arum, his current employer.</TE>
<TE>   Caplan even claims to have been present at the hair-raising moment
when King forever stamped his image in the consciousness of his
sport.</TE>
<TE>   It was in a hotel back in the 1970s, when King was first making
his presence felt in boxing. King, says Caplan, went into a bathroom,
comb in hand, with his hair looking semi-normal, and emerged with his
trademark electric-socket look.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think this will help me get noticed?" King asked,
according to Caplan.</TE>
<TE>   King says he doesn't recall the incident, implying, apparently,
that his hair grows that way naturally.</TE>
<TE>   Always There, by George</TE>
<TE>   Caplan has been most closely aligned with Foreman. At a luncheon
earlier this week to announce the hall inductees, Caplan broke down
when he realized he was going in with his longtime friend.</TE>
<TE>   Caplan met Foreman in Oakland in 1967, when the fighter was an
18-year-old amateur who had just suffered his first loss after having
gone 6-0.</TE>
<TE>   Caplan, wearing a tuxedo because he was working as a ring
announcer that night, went into the locker room, patted the dejected
Foreman on the back and told him, "Don't worry, son, you're going to
be a good fighter someday."</TE>
<TE>   Foreman later said he was contemplating early retirement until
this "celebrity" gave him confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "Why did you think I was a celebrity that night?" Caplan asked
him.</TE>
<TE>   "Because you were wearing a tuxedo," Foreman said, "and because
you were telling everybody else what to do."</TE>
<TE>   Seven years later, Caplan was again trying to boost Foreman's
flagging spirits, this time in Zaire after his crushing defeat at the
hands of Muhammad Ali.</TE>
<TE>   Foreman, lying on a rubbing table, still in shock, told a
gathering of worldwide media, "I found true friendship tonight. I
found a true friend in Bill Caplan."</TE>
<TE>   Foreman retired in 1977, announcing that he would never again bare
his chest to the world. Nine years later, Caplan read in an in-flight
magazine that Foreman had announced he was thinking of again publicly
taking his shirt off.</TE>
<TE>   Caplan rushed to Foreman's home in Houston. When Foreman opened
the door, he looked at Caplan, smiled and said, "Bill, what took you
so long?"</TE>
<TE>   The comeback was on.</TE>
<TE>   Lying Down on the Job</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, Pintor, then the World Boxing Council's bantamweight
champion, agreed to defend his title against South Korean Seung-Hoon
Lee. Caplan arranged a news conference at a Korean restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving first, Pintor and his entourage waited for Lee in vain
for 45 minutes. Finally, despite the frantic appeals of Caplan,
Pintor and his followers stormed out and got into their station wagon
in the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Caplan, determined to see this news conference come off, lay down
in front of the car, all 300-plus pounds of him.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked like a beached Jewish whale," Caplan said.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, the Pintor car inched forward until, just before it
reached Caplan, Lee arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Wrote Allan Malamud in the Herald Examiner, "Everyone was rooting
for the station wagon."</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 19, at the Crowne Plaza and Commerce Casino, Caplan and
the rest of the class of 2002 will be inducted. And nobody will be
asking, Bill who?</TE>

<HD>Rules Form Another Kind of Prison</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If any Arkansas football players are going to prison, they'll have to
get there on their own.</LD>
<LD>   Razorback Coach Houston Nutt recently devised a plan for an
educational--and cautionary--visit to the Grimes Unit of the Arkansas
State Prison for a little cultural exchange.</LD>
<LD>   "We were going to have Raymond House, Jermaine Brooks, Josh Melton
[and] Mark Bokermann talk to about 25 of their guys, and then we were
going to have about seven lifers talk to our guys," Nutt said.</LD>
<TE>   But the plan called for 38 players to travel by private plane to
the prison facility--a violation of NCAA rules that prohibit
transporting players for any reason other than practice or
competition. An Arkansas appeal was denied.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you get one approved, it sets a precedent for other schools,
and the potential for abuse," said Derrick Gragg, associate athletic
director at Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   Right: Allowing regular prison transport could open a whole can of
worms.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the only pure placekicker in the Pro Football
Hall of Fame?</TE>
<TE>   More NCAA news: Arizona's Rick Anderson, a senior forward from
Long Beach, recently was prohibited from appearing on the game show
"Family Feud" with his family, the Arizona Republic notes.</TE>
<TE>   Seems it was deemed the appearance would violate the NCAA
extra-benefit rule.</TE>
<TE>   Hmmm.... As the Republic's Paola Boivin observed, Arizona State
and Nebraska football players each were allowed to take home an Xbox
(retail value: $199.99) for participating in the Black Coaches Assn.
Classic. (The NCAA allows gifts up to $300 in value at bowls and
preseason games.)</TE>
<TE>   We're thinking Anderson would do well in this category: Rules
interpretations gone awry.</TE>
<TE>   Hang time: At 40, Philadelphia Eagle punter Sean Landeta is
entering his 18th NFL season.</TE>
<TE>   Just for kicks, the Philadelphia Inquirer's Ron Reid did the math
on Landeta's 52,737 punting yards: That's almost 30 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Translator, please: The Charlotte Observer's Tom Sorensen recently
got 30 minutes alone with the 400-plus page Carolina Panther
playbook.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't know a lot more after than he did before he tried to
memorize things such as "258 pump" and "cut greyhound 8."</TE>
<TE>   If a (theoretically) literate sportswriter is overwhelmed, what
about those proverbially dim football players? Offensive lineman
Kevin Donnalley--obviously not among them--explained.</TE>
<TE>   "You might not be able to recite the quadratic formula or
Pythagorean theorem or the Magna Carta," he said. "But there are guys
that know this book like the back of their hand. Maybe they're
learning this instead of other things."</TE>
<TE>   Floundering: Florida Marlins' attendance at Pro Player Stadium
last week included the second-, third-and fourth-smallest crowds in
franchise history, reports Jack O'Connell of the Hartford Courant.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't see this market getting much worse," Marlin first baseman
Derrek Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Jan Stenerud, inducted in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: PGA Championship winner Rich Beem on the spoils being
heaped atop his $990,000 winner's share:</TE>
<TE>   "I think the IRS is going to enjoy my next quarterly income
statement."</TE>

<TE>   Reporter Armen Keteyian delivers a telling look at the Washington
Redskins' new coach, Steve Spurrier.</TE>
<TE>   Viewers learn that the 57-year-old coach is a follower of Sun Tzu,
a Far Eastern philosopher whose book, "Art of War," professes the
importance of winning decisively.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier, who won six Southeastern Conference titles and one
national championship (1996) at Florida, has been called an offensive
genius. Keteyian notes that Spurrier prefers to be known as an
offensive "mastermind."</TE>
<TE>   Of his reputation for having a big ego, Spurrier says, "If our
teams didn't score a lot of points, I may be known as a nice guy."</TE>
<TE>   One thing that provides some insight into Spurrier's psyche is a
story he tells about his father, a strict Presbyterian minister in
Johnson City, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   "One year he asked our Babe Ruth League team, 'How many of you
believe it's not whether you win or lose but how you play the game?'
" Spurrier says. "A few kids raised their hands and he told them they
were wrong. He said, 'The game is played to be won.' "</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the piece, Spurrier tells Keteyian: "We could still
fall flat on our face if we don't keep pushing, pushing, pushing."</TE>
<TE>   Keteyian: "You think you'll fall flat on your face?"</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier: "I don't think so, but I know it's possible. I've seen
so many great coaches who think they've got it made, and one or two
years later they're broadcasting, or doing something like that."</TE>
<TE>   Another segment examines traveling youth baseball, which makes
Little League appear laid-back.</TE>
<TE>   Teams consisting of kids 13 and under play as many as 120 games a
season. Two teams featured are the Say Hey Kids of Antioch, Calif.,
and the San Diego Cobras.</TE>

<HD>Ishii Has His Share of Issues</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Left-hander gives up five runs in first inning of
7-5 loss to Braves. Brown is impressive in relief.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were a couple of eye-catching items in the Dodger Stadium
lost-and-found bin Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   Lost was a baseball game to the Atlanta Braves, who rocked pitcher
Kazuhisa Ishii for five runs in the first inning en route to a 7-5
victory over the Dodgers before a crowd of 50,306, trimming the
Dodgers' National League wild-card lead over San Francisco to 3 1/2
games.</LD>
<LD>   Found was a pitcher by the name of Kevin Brown--not the circa-1998
flamethrower who was one of baseball's most dominant pitchers, but
something far more effective than the wobbly right-hander who battled
injuries in April and May and looked out of whack in his first two
relief appearances in August.</LD>
<TE>   Brown, who underwent surgery for a herniated disk in his lower
back on June 11, replaced Ishii to start the second and struck out
nine in four innings, giving up two runs and four hits.</TE>
<TE>   He threw 84 pitches, and while his velocity was not vintage
Brown--his fastball was in the 91-mph range, a few ticks off his
normal 94 mph--his sinker and split-fingered fastball were lively.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy would not speculate on possible changes in the
starting rotation, but Brown's performance, coupled with Ishii's
struggles--the Japanese left-hander has a 9.12 earned-run average in
his last six starts--will warrant strong consideration for a switch
of Brown for Ishii by next weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "Eighty-four pitches, nine strikeouts, you have to feel good about
that," Tracy said. "That was, by far, the best outing he's had since
coming off the disabled list [on Aug. 15]. It's a build-up process.
You have to give him an opportunity to get his feet wet, but it was
awfully good tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who has been working out in the bullpen after games so as
not to impact his availability for the games, declined to comment
Sunday night, but earlier in the afternoon he said he was not
frustrated by his limited relief role.</TE>
<TE>   "If I didn't think I could [return to form] in the role I'm in
now, I wouldn't be doing this," Brown said. "It's just a matter of
when I'm right, I'm right. And when I'm right, I'll have a pretty
good idea."</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of two third-inning walks and a subsequent
pitch that was smoked for a two-run triple by Mark DeRosa, Brown
looked right Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   "The tempo of his delivery and his release point were pretty
consistent," pitching coach Jim Colborn said. "Some of his pitches
were pretty sharp."</TE>
<TE>   Sharp enough to convince at least one teammate Brown was
rotation-ready.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can get him back and see more of what we saw tonight,"
Shawn Green said, "it's almost like we've made an acquisition with
him out there every fifth day."</TE>
<TE>   With 32 games left in the regular season, provided there is no
work stoppage, the Dodgers, who won two of three from the Braves,
can't afford to be patient with Ishii, who increased his major
league-leading walk total to 100 when he issued free passes to two of
the first three batters he faced.</TE>
<TE>   Chipper Jones then ripped a three-run homer to left for a 3-0
lead, Andruw Jones doubled and Javy Lopez homered for a 5-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to have that first inning back," Tracy said. "There is
no defense for walks and home runs."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii finished the first inning but was pulled in favor of Brown,
who struck out the side in the second. The Dodgers stormed back with
four runs, two unearned, off Atlanta left-hander Damian Moss in the
bottom of the second, a rally that began with Paul Lo Duca's double,
Eric Karros' infield single and Mike Kinkade's run-scoring double.</TE>
<TE>   Brave shortstop Rafael Furcal booted Jolbert Cabrera's grounder,
with Karros scoring. Brown's bunt moved Cabrera to second, Cesar
Izturis' groundout scored Kinkade, and Marquis Grissom's RBI double
pulled the Dodgers within 5-4.</TE>
<TE>   Two walks and one mistake to DeRosa hurt Brown in the third;
DeRosa's two-out, two-run triple gave Atlanta a 7-4 lead. But Brown
blanked the Braves over the next two innings, pitching out of a
first-and-third, one-out jam in the fourth by striking out Chipper
Jones and getting Andruw Jones to pop to second.</TE>
<TE>   "Kevin hadn't pitched in a few days, they scored five runs in the
first, so we had to make a change. And we found out some things about
Kevin Brown that we're very intrigued by," Tracy said.</TE>

<LD>The Montreal Expos had the major leagues' best record, 74-40, when
baseball's last work stoppage wiped out the final seven weeks of the
regular season and then the playoffs and World Series in 1994.</LD>
<LD>   Current Dodger Marquis Grissom was the starting center fielder for
that team, which included standouts such as Larry Walker, Moises
Alou, Ken Hill, and John Wetteland, and rising stars such as Pedro
Martinez, Cliff Floyd and Jeff Shaw.</LD>
<LD>   Heavy financial losses incurred during the seven-month strike
forced Montreal to break up the 1994 team and virtually sell it off,
piece by piece, over the next few years.</LD>
<TE>   The result: The Expos never made it to the playoffs, and their
franchise has fallen into such disrepair that there is threat of
contraction or a possible move out of Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Now Grissom could be in the same position again, one that makes
him squirm. His Dodgers are 3 1/2 games ahead of San Francisco in the
National League wild-card race, with a sparkling 75-55 record and
postseason aspirations, just like the Expos had in 1994. But another
strike Friday could render their promising season moot.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been around for three work stoppages, and one for me is too
many," said Grissom, a 13-year veteran. "And to be in first place for
two of those, that's tough. That [Expo] team was something so
special, I hate to keep imagining how good we could have been and how
long we could have won for.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball is a beautiful game, and to see it in this kind of shape
over nothing.... There's enough for everybody. There's enough
revenue, if they want to share it, we can work it out. They want a
salary cap? It's always something that can be worked out. It boils
down to, how much do you want?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center fielder Dave Roberts, who did not start Saturday because of
a stiff neck, could have played Sunday, but Manager Jim Tracy did not
start him because the Braves were pitching left-hander Damian Moss,
who held left-handers to a .165 average prior to Sunday's game.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom started in center and Mike Kinkade started in left, a move
that paid dividends when Kinkade smacked a ground-rule RBI double
during the Dodgers' four-run second inning.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts appeared as a pinch-hitter in the ninth, popping to
second.</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek, who started the previous 21
games and is batting .336 since the All-Star break, did not start
Sunday because of a tender right hamstring. Grudzielanek entered as
part of a double switch in the eighth inning and is expected to start
tonight.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger closer Eric Gagne got to fulfill the boyhood dream of just
about every kid growing up in hockey-mad Montreal--he hoisted the
Stanley Cup above his head Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne took part in a pregame ceremony honoring Detroit Red Wing
and former King star Luc Robitaille, who brought the Stanley Cup to
Dodger Stadium on Sunday and received a Dodger jersey from Gagne.</TE>

<TE>   We're fighting mad (We're bummed).</TE>
<TE>   Listen up, baseball boneheads: You thought we were saps for coming
back, like stray cats to a milk pan, after you guys wiped out the
1994 World Series.</TE>
<TE>   We are not saps! (We are saps).</TE>
<TE>   Well, 1994 was different (It was not different).</TE>
<TE>   See, after 1994, Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire lured us back with
their fairy-tale pursuit of Roger Maris' home run record.</TE>
<TE>   You won't luck out this time (You'll luck out).</TE>
<TE>   Sosa-McGwire was a once-in-a-lifetime thing (What would you call

Scully?).</TE>

plastic fielding gloves or hollow-core baseballs).</TE>
<TE>   Read our lips: You Walk, We Walk (But, gee, I'm 44, just had my
high school mitt re-laced and last week knocked over an old lady
trying to catch a foul ball).</TE>
<TE>   We're done funding your stadiums (Unless you put a swimming pool
with a slide in center field!).</TE>
<TE>   We won't seek your autographs (Unless our favorite player's
signing Saturday at the local appliance store).</TE>

<HD>Virginia Tech Takes 63-7 Rout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BLACKSBURG, Va.</DL>
<LD>By the end of the first quarter, there was no doubt Virginia Tech
Coach Frank Beamer was going to celebrate his 150th win.</LD>
<LD>   Lee Suggs ran for his first touchdown in almost a year and
Virginia Tech scored a team-record 56 points before halftime Sunday
as the No. 16 Hokies routed Arkansas State, 63-7, in the Hispanic
College Fund Football Classic.</LD>
<LD>   Opening the season without 11 starters from last year, Virginia
Tech was led by sophomores Bryan Randall and DeAngello Hall, who
combined for five touchdowns. "When you have some fast guys you just
want to play fast and watch the blurs go by," Beamer said.</LD>
<TE>   Hokie running back Suggs, the nation's leading scorer two years
ago, made a successful return after missing nearly all of last year
because of a torn ligament in his left knee. He gained 87 yards and
scored the Hokies' second touchdown on a 42-yard run in his first
game since Sept. 1, 2001, when he was injured against Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a year since I've been in the end zone," Suggs said.
"It's just a wonderful feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Randall, who replaced Grant Noel at quarterback in the second
quarter, completed six of eight passes for 66 yards, including a
19-yard pass for a touchdown to Mike Imoh. Randall also ran for two
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Hall scored twice in the first quarter, returning a punt and an
interception for touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Seven Virginia Tech players had touchdowns in the first half as
the Hokies took a 56-0 lead. The previous Virginia Tech record for
points in a first half was 49, against Rutgers in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "The way it happened was unbelievable," said Steve Roberts,
Arkansas State's first-year coach. "You don't expect that to happen.
We didn't take care of the football. They took advantage of the
mistakes we made."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all the Hokies got some playing time after Tech scored
touchdowns on five consecutive possessions in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We dressed 70 guys, and I think we got 68 into the game," Beamer
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Hokies had some tough adjustments to make on defense after
losing six starters and five of its front seven, including standout
linebackers Ben Taylor and Jake Houseright.</TE>
<TE>   But the inexperience didn't appear to change the way the Hokies
usually dominate opponents. Arkansas State turned the ball over five
times and was held to 227 yards, 73 of which came on Elliott Jacobs'
touchdown pass to Mike Cox in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "The defense is ready," Hall said. "No matter what people say, the
defense is ready."</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs completed nine of 16 passes for 177 yards and a touchdown.
Mike Cox caught five passes for 120 yards and a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas State was 2-9 last season and hasn't had a winning season
since 1995. Arkansas State sorely missed two-time 1,000-yard rusher
Jonathan Adams, who is now on the New Orleans Saints. Adams'
successor, Danny Smith, had 36 yards rushing and was benched after
fumbling three times.</TE>

<HD>Parry Finally Gets His First PGA Tour Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Craig Parry had endured so many crushing losses in 10 years and 235
starts on the PGA Tour that he wasn't about to celebrate too soon
Sunday in the NEC Invitational at Sammamish, Wash.</LD>
<LD>   Only when his lead was four strokes, and another raucous cheer at
Sahalee Country Club told him his second shot had reached the green
on the par-five 18th hole, was the 36-year-old Australian unable to
contain a sly smile.</LD>
<LD>   Tied for the lead going into the final round, with Tiger Woods and
Ernie Els among those in position to track him down, Parry put
together a masterpiece by closing with a six-under 65 and playing the
final 48 holes without a bogey.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a long time coming," Parry said. "To win on this tour means
everything to me."</TE>
<TE>   Parry finished at 16-under 268, four strokes ahead of Robert
Allenby (69) and Fred Funk (68).</TE>
<TE>   Woods was trying to become the first player in 75 years to win the
same tournament four years in a row. Starting the final round two

<DH>Horse racing: Bad start in Pacific Classic for War Emblem
draws complaint from Baffert. Came Home wins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>The only way to beat War Emblem might be to give him the gate, but
another bad start for the Kentucky Derby winner shouldn't detract
from Came Home's authoritative win Sunday in the $1-million Pacific
Classic at Del Mar.</LD>
<LD>   From the same barn--trainer Paco Gonzalez and owners Trudy
McCaffery and John Toffan--that won Del Mar's richest race with Free
House in 1998, Came Home responded to the rat-a-tat-tat of jockey
Mike Smith's whipping from the quarter pole to the wire, winning by
three-quarters of a length before 36,041, the track's third-largest
crowd. War Emblem, more than 10 lengths better when Came Home
struggled to finish sixth in the Derby in May, had problems loading,
came away late and ran sixth after leading for a few strides at the
top of the stretch.</LD>
<LD>   When War Emblem stumbled and almost fell at the break of the
Belmont Stakes, leading to an eighth-place finish and a squandered
Triple Crown, trainer Bob Baffert attributed the awkward beginning to
racing luck. But after the Pacific Classic, Baffert sizzled,
suggesting that Del Mar's starting-gate crew and Gary Brinson, the
official starter, had compromised War Emblem's chances.</LD>
<TE>   With all 14 starters in the gate, War Emblem, who drew the No. 6
post, was backed out of his stall for the second time. He was barely
back in when Brinson released the field. War Emblem, who won the
Derby on the front end, brushed the horse next to him, leaving the
gate as jockey Victor Espinoza settled for an early third-place
position behind Sky Jack and Bosque Redondo, Came Home's stablemate,
whose role was to ensure a solid early pace.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the starter was trying to help, but I don't need
that kind of help," Baffert said. "I kind of think [Brinson] caught
him up in the air. I was wishing I had a radio to tell Victor to hold
[Brinson] up. I think the starter sort of over-compensated, and that
was one of the worst things--for the gate to open at that time, when
he was still walking."</TE>
<TE>   The son of a trainer, Brinson is a veteran starter who handles the
same duties at Hollywood Park. A 14-horse field is a rare experience
for the Del Mar gate crew. According to Joe Harper, president of the
track, that many horses haven't run in a race here since the Del Mar
Futurity in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   "[War Emblem] was rearing up and pawing at the gate, so we backed
him out," Brinson said. "We loaded him again and he started rearing
and pawing at the gate again and we backed him out. I was afraid if
we didn't back him out, he would hook a foot over the door and hurt
himself. So we loaded him last and as soon as he was set, we [broke
the field]. The way he was acting, if he was in the gate much longer,
there was going to be a serious problem."</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem was beaten by about 4 1/4 lengths. Since the late
Prince Ahmed bin Salman bought 90% of him for $900,000 the week after
his Illinois Derby win, the colt has won the Derby, Preakness and
Haskell under Baffert and lost twice--in the Belmont and Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have enough chance," Espinoza said of the start. "He
wasn't ready. The back door to the gate wasn't even closed when they
opened the front one. He wasn't ready to break and we came away a
little too slow. When he broke like that, I didn't have much choice
but to spot him where I did. I didn't want to rush him to try to make
the lead. I just had to be patient. No doubt I would have been on the
lead if I had broken clean. Turning for home, I felt he might go, but
it wasn't there at the end."</TE>
<TE>   When the serious running began, leaving the quarter pole, War
Emblem was overtaking Bosque Redondo and Sky Jack, but Came Home, who
had been in fourth place, was moving even faster from the far
outside. The winner felt the crack of Smith's whip five times before
they straightened out in the homestretch. Smith hit him 19 more times
through the lane.</TE>
<TE>   Momentum, emerging from heavy traffic, finished second, 1 1/2
lengths ahead of Milwaukee Brew, who was next to last, 12 1/2 lengths
behind, with a half-mile left. Pleasantly Perfect, a 17-1 shot
running in his first stake, was fourth.</TE>
<TE>   In the 12th Pacific Classic, War Emblem, who went off at 6-5, was
the 11th favorite to fall. Came Home, the third 3-year-old to win the
stake, paid $23, running 1 1/4 miles in 2:01 2/5. For Californians
McCaffery and Toffan and their partners, Will Farish of Kentucky and
Texan John Goodman, the Gone West-Nice Assay colt earned $600,000,
pushing his purses to $1.8 million. Gonzalez, Came Home's trainer,
knew Came Home could handle 1 1/4 miles--also the Kentucky Derby
distance--the way he finished in winning the Swaps at 1 1/8 miles
last month at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody said that the only way this horse could get a mile and a
quarter was in a helicopter, but I knew better," Gonzalez said.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez's other horse, Bosque Redondo, who finished fifth, broke
down past the wire and had to be vanned off. His jockey, David
Flores, was shaken up and took off the rest of his mounts. Bosque
Redondo fractured bones in his right foreleg. His racing career over,
he will undergo surgery either today or Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The vets think he has a good chance at survival," Gonzalez said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, 37, is a two-time Eclipse Award-winning jockey who has won
eight Breeders' Cup races. He moved his business from New York to
Southern California in May 2001 and was hired to ride Came Home when
Chris McCarron retired after his winning ride aboard the colt in the
Affirmed Handicap, three weeks before the Swaps.</TE>
<TE>   "[Came Home] digs in, he gives it all he's got," Smith said. "When
I came up alongside War Emblem on the turn, he went for it. He veered
in a little bit on me [in the stretch], but it wasn't that big of a
deal. In the end, it was a question of whether he was good enough. He
was plenty good enough."</TE>

<TE>   Earlier Sunday at Del Mar, Kalookan Queen beat Warren's Whistle by
3 1/2 lengths to win the Rancho Bernardo Handicap for the second
consecutive year.... In other races, Shine Again beat Raging Fever by
a half-length to win the Ballerina Handicap at Saratoga and
Sabertooth won the Longacres Mile at Emerald Downs.</TE>

<LD>Those who thought the day after the Pacific Classic would be
anticlimactic turned out to be correct.</LD>
<LD>   For most of the day Sunday, thanks to a rash of upsets, it
appeared there was going to be a massive pick-six carryover because
of the $1-million pool that was guaranteed on Del Mar's biggest day.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, there was one perfect ticket that managed to isolate
Classic upsetter Came Home and five other non-favorites, and it was
worth $709,396.</LD>
<TE>   So, there isn't much to get excited about on the final day of Del
Mar's fifth week. The average field size is less than eight, and
there isn't a whole lot in terms of quality.</TE>
<TE>   A victory by European import Atarama in the seventh, a $60,000
allowance at one mile on the turf, would be noteworthy for her
trainer, Kristin Mulhall.</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of Richard Mulhall, a former trainer and current
racing manager for the Thoroughbred Corporation, Kristin is seeking
the first victory of her career. A 3-year-old Sadler's Wells filly
owned by, not surprisingly, the Thoroughbred Corporation, Atarama is
the 5-2 second choice on Jeff Tufts' morning line in the field of
six.</TE>
<TE>   Bred in Ireland and trained in Europe by John Dunlop, Atarama, who
raced primarily in England before making one appearance in Germany,
picked up her lone win in seven starts going seven furlongs at Redcar
last Oct. 6. She will be ridden by Victor Espinoza. who had a pair of
turf victories Sunday, and will race on Lasix for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   The filly to beat is 2-1 favorite Nicole's Pursuit, who has made
the board in all four of her turf starts, winning once.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Del Mar's leading trainer Bob Baffert will send
out a pair of rookies--Gone Ballistic and Oopstheregoes--in the
fourth, a maiden event for 2-year-olds at one mile on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: William White. The trainer is the runaway leader at
Calder, winning with about 26% of his starters.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Gary Rogers. Another trainer based at Calder, he has
won with only three of 77 starters this year.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Bartending Mike and Johnny
Ola in the fifth, Brief Message, McAdam and High Noon Meeting in the
sixth, singling Nicole's Pursuit in the seventh and Beauty Contest,
Lil Bit Devlish and Roberta's Mango in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/61. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $6.80/$368. Total money bet: $496.</TE>

<LD>Payroll tax: This is the biggest hurdle. Under the union plan, the
minimum payroll subject to taxation would be $125 million in 2003,
$135 million in 2004 and $145 million in 2005, after which point the
tax would end.</LD>
<LD>   Under the owners' proposal, a team would be taxed at 35% the first
time it exceeded the threshold, 40% the second time, 45% the third
time and 50% the fourth time. The players proposed tax rates of 15%
to 40%. Management adopted the union's tax-rate formula, but
increased the threshold to $107 million in the first three years of
the contract and $111 million in 2006. Owners want payroll to be
calculated using 40-man instead of 25-man rosters, plus benefits,
pushing many clubs toward the proposed threshold.</LD>
<LD>   Based on projections, the New York Yankees and Texas Rangers are
the only teams that would be affected by the union's tax plan next
season. That's unacceptable to the owners, who insist that the next
agreement include a viable mechanism to slow escalating player
salaries.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue sharing: Owners reduced their proposal from $282 million
to $263 million. The union's current proposal is $242.3 million in
the last year. Because of the phase-ins, the sides are $222.8 million
apart on the amount of money that would be transferred from
high-revenue to low-revenue clubs over four years.</TE>
<TE>   The basic concept of revenue sharing is that the entire sport
benefits if high-revenue clubs share their profits to enable low-end
teams to spend more money on players, increasing competitive balance.
So, what's the holdup on this issue?</TE>
<TE>   Well, the union views the combination of a payroll tax and revenue
sharing as a salary cap by another name. There is some wiggle room
here, but apparently not much.</TE>
<TE>   Amateur draft: The sides have agreed to a worldwide draft, but the
number of draft rounds is at issue.</TE>
<TE>   The union had previously proposed conducting a worldwide draft in
two phases, international and American, creating two sets of
first-round draft picks and more big bonuses. It wants to reduce the
draft to 16 rounds from the current 50-round format, creating more
free agents. Owners want a 38-round draft.</TE>
<TE>   Also at issue is the fate of the baseball academies teams operate
in Venezuela and the Dominican Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Minimum payrolls: Owners have been rebuffed in their attempts to
implement a minimum $45-million payroll, which the union considers to
be another restraint of business.</TE>
<TE>   Drug testing: The union has ended its long-standing opposition to
random testing for steroids. However, there are details still to be
resolved.</TE>

<HD>Owners Make Slight Move</HD>
<DH>Baseball: With strike deadline looming, management team
revises proposal. Players aren't impressed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after blasting players for seeking phased-in revenue sharing,
baseball owners made a new economic proposal Sunday in an effort to
get labor talks back on track, moving slightly toward the union with
a strike deadline later this week.</LD>
<LD>   Management's revised offer to the players' union featured
increased payroll-tax thresholds and reduced tax rates. During
negotiating sessions in New York, owners also proposed a small
decrease in the amount of local revenue they want clubs to share, and
modified points in their plan for steroid testing.</LD>
<LD>   The movement occurred as the sides continued to chide each other
in dueling conference calls with reporters, expressing frustration
about Saturday's contentious events that could have put them on a
collision course to baseball's ninth work stoppage in 30 years with
another strike set to begin Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Rob Manfred, management's lead labor lawyer, ended his optimistic
characterization of talks in ripping union head Don Fehr for
proposing phase-ins, triggering a night of sniping. But Manfred led
his team back to the table Sunday with a proposal, deciding that "the
best way to find out if they were serious about making an agreement
was to put whatever happened [Saturday] night to one side, make a
forthcoming proposal and see if they could manage to do the same
thing."</TE>
<TE>   The union was not overjoyed with the owners' economic proposal,
which it hoped would move much closer to its position, and their
amendments to steroid testing also have not completely bridged the
gap.</TE>
<TE>   "While they did make some small movements in those areas, the
luxury tax thresholds remain very, very low and constitute a big
problem for us at this point," Fehr said. "The differences continue
to be narrowed [on steroid testing] and there still are some. We
think we have come a very, very long way from the position that the
players have traditionally taken on these issues."</TE>
<TE>   Players believe management is not doing enough to avert a strike.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting to the point where it's a joke to me," said catcher
Paul Lo Duca, the Dodger player representative. "We've given them
everything they wanted. We make a proposal and they go straight to
the press with it. It's almost like, 'What more do they want?' It
seems like we're trying and they're not, and they're making us out to
be the enemy. That's a little upsetting.</TE>
<TE>   "All the fans think we're greedy, that we're doing this to get
paid. You know what? We're negotiating with billionaires. It seems
like it's six or eight [hawk owners]. What about the 22 other owners?
You never hear from them. We come down farther and farther, and they
come up a bit, and we're the bad guys.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting to the point now where we've given a lot. When are
they going to give something? I'm not talking about [Dodger Chairman
Bob Daly]. He wants to play."</TE>
<TE>   Under management's new proposal, clubs would share 36% of local
revenue, an increase from 20% this season. Owners had previously
sought 37% revenue sharing and the union Saturday raised its figure
to 33.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Management's plan would now transfer $263 million from
high-revenue to low-revenue clubs next season, based on 2001 figures.
The union proposal would eventually transfer $242.3 million--but only
in the final year of the agreement. Its plan calls for transferring
$172.3 million in 2003, $195.6 million in 2004, $219 million in 2005
and $242.3 million in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Manfred acknowledged the union had broached the subject of
phase-ins, but not at a level that would increase revenue sharing
about only $3 million next season from its current level of $169
million. Owners want the plan to be implemented fully next season to
slow salary growth. Because of the phase-ins, the sides are $222.8
million apart on the revenue sharing transfer number.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't have any phase-ins, then the [New York] Yankees'
burden increases from $28 million to approximately $57 million in
revenue sharing [using the union model]," Fehr said. "They would pay
another huge amount, perhaps up to $25 million, in luxury taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody, not even the Yankees, can absorb that kind of hit to
their financial structure at once. Nobody ever expects them to.
Nobody ever thought it would turn out that way. From our point,
phase-ins are going to be integral parts of this deal."</TE>
<TE>   And that continues to upset owners.</TE>
<TE>   "The notion that their proposal for 2003 is a transfer of $172
million, when us and the rest of America thought it was for $235
million, is a bit of a problem," Manfred said. "If they can't manage
to make a proposal that corrects the directional problem that they
had [Saturday], we will not continue to move toward them."</TE>
<TE>   The payroll tax remains the biggest hurdle. Owners, determined to
slow spending of high-revenue teams, are demanding the tax that the
union, in conjunction with increased revenue sharing, views as a
salary cap by another name.</TE>
<TE>   Owners increased their threshold to $107 million in the first
three years of the new contract and to $111 million in 2006. Based on
projections, seven teams would be affected under those thresholds.</TE>
<TE>   The union has proposed thresholds of $125 million next year, $135
million in 2004 and $145 million in 2005. Also at issue is the
union's opposition to a tax in the final season of the deal, and the
tax rates.</TE>
<TE>   Owners want teams to be taxed at 35% the first time they exceed
the threshold, 40% the second time, 45% the third time and 50% the
fourth time. Players have proposed rates of 15% to 40%.</TE>
<TE>   "They think we're bluffing," Lo Duca said. "We're not."</TE>

<HD>It Takes a Louisville Slugger to Win Title</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Aaron Alvey knew he had a home run when he saw the first pitch coming
in the first inning.</LD>
<LD>   The 12-year-old pitcher didn't seem as confident when he got the
last out to win the Little League World Series, letting out a huge
sigh of relief.</LD>
<LD>   Alvey hit a 250-foot shot in the first inning and set two pitching
records and tied a third as Louisville, Ky., beat Sendai, Japan, 1-0,
on Sunday night for the championship.</LD>
<TE>   "It was 68 mph down the middle," Alvey said. "It was belt-high, so
it was going to get crushed."</TE>
<TE>   Then, with two out in the sixth inning, a clearly nervous Alvey
walked Yoosuke Katoh, bringing up Tatsuhiko Numakura, who had three
home runs in the series. But Numakura's line drive was caught by
first baseman Casey Jordan to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I was like, 'Have I got it? Have I got it?' " Jordan said. "I
just had to pull it down, see it first."</TE>
<TE>   Alvey struck out 11 on his way to setting World Series records for
strikeouts (44) and scoreless innings (21) and tying the mark for
consecutive no-hit innings (12).</TE>
<TE>   "Me and my teammates worked really hard since it started," Alvey
said. "Me and my teammates are really, really happy that this
happened."</TE>
<TE>   Alvey experienced shoulder pain midway through the game, and
received heat treatments in the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   "My shoulder started hurting a little bit ... then it started
feeling good," he said. "I went back out there to do my thing."</TE>
<TE>   Louisville is the first U.S. team to win the title since Toms
River, N.J., beat Kashima, Japan, in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "Aaron pitched a tremendous game, there's no question. But our
defense stepped up again tonight," Louisville Manager J. Troy Osborne
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There were several balls out there today that Josh [Robinson]
handled, plus the big one at the end of the ballgame. Casey did a
tremendous job. If that ball gets to right field, as fast as they
are, they're going to score."</TE>
<TE>   Alvey struck out Yoshinori Satoh in the second to break the
31-year-old record for strikeouts. Mu-Hsu Chin, of Taiwan, struck out
36 in two games in 1971, including 22 in nine innings in Tainan
City's 12-3 championship victory over Gary, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   Alvey tied the record with 12 consecutive no-hit innings--one
against Clemmons, N.C., nine against Fort Worth, Texas, and the first
two against Japan. Sean Burroughs also had 12 consecutive no-hit
innings in 1993 for champion Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday night, Alvey threw a no-hitter through nine innings
in Louisville's 2-1, 11-inning victory over Fort Worth in the U.S.
semifinals. Although Little League rules required that Alvey be
replaced in the 10th inning, his performance was recorded as a
no-hitter, the longest no-hitter in Little League history.</TE>

<KH>SPARKS VS. NEW YORK</KH>
<HD>FIRST LOOK AT THE WNBA FINALS</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Small forward: Mwadi Mabika (16.8 points, 5.2 rebounds) vs. Crystal
Robinson (11.8 points, 2.9 rebounds). Mabika was hampered by a left
ankle sprain during the Utah series but looked as if she had
recovered with 15 points in series-clinching victory Saturday. She
will need her quickness to neutralize Robinson's strength around the
basket, as well as her leaping ability for rebounds. Robinson will
get her points but has had trouble stopping explosive, quick forwards
such as Tamika Catchings and Chamique Holdsclaw without help.</LD>
<LD>   Advantage: Sparks.</LD>
<LD>   Power forward: DeLisha Milton (11.3 points, 6.6 rebounds) vs.
Tamika Whitmore (12.7 points, 4.4 rebounds). Arguably the most
crucial matchup of the series. Milton averaged 18 points against
Utah, making five of nine from three-point range. Whitmore averaged
15.3 points against the Mystics and is a dominant scorer from inside
eight feet. Whitmore has to figure a way around Milton's long arms,
and Milton has to keep Whitmore from overpowering her inside the key.</LD>
<TE>   Advantage: Even.</TE>
<TE>   Center: Lisa Leslie (16.9 points, 10.4 rebounds) vs. Tara Phillips
(14.1 points, 7.0 rebounds). Both are intensely competitive post
players, and neither has much use for the other. Phillips not only
gives up about three inches in height, she was noticeably limping in
the Washington series. If her ankles are not sound, she will not be
able to keep up with Leslie, who is as comfortable away from the
basket as she is underneath it.</TE>
<TE>   Advantage: Sparks.</TE>
<TE>   Shooting guard: Tamecka Dixon (10.6, 4.0 assists) vs. Vickie
Johnson (11.6 points, 2.8 assists). Both players have been solid in
the postseason. Dixon is scoring in double figures, shooting 54% from
the field after averaging 39% in the regular season. Johnson has been
at her best when it mattered most, scoring 19 and 21 points in the
series-clinching wins over Indiana and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Advantage: Even.</TE>
<TE>   Point guard: Nikki Teasley (6.4 points, 4.4 assists) vs. Teresa
Weatherspoon (3.4 points, 5.7 assists). Weatherspoon is the epitome
of the cagey old pro, but her lack of offense has been glaring.
Against Utah, Teasley looked the best she has all season. She had 11
points, nine assists and no turnovers Saturday and is playing at her
highest level of confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Advantage: Sparks.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches: Michael Cooper vs. Richie Adubato. Cooper has the Sparks
back at the level of efficiency they were at last year in winning the
title. Adubato has been squeezing every ounce of emotion and effort
he can out of the Liberty. Cooper has a big edge in overall talent,
Adubato a slight edge in Xs and O's.</TE>
<TE>   Advantage: Even.</TE>
<TE>   The series: This is the kind of coast-to-coast championship
matchup the league has privately waited for since it began play in
1997. New York is making its fourth trip to the championship series
and still is waiting for a ring. The Sparks, aiming to repeat as
champions, have won seven games in a row. The Sparks have reason to
be glad they have home-court advantage because no team feeds off the
home-court energy the way New York does. The Sparks have yet to be in
a position where they had to win or be eliminated. But the Liberty
needs to win Game 1, considering it lost its road playoff games at
Indiana and Washington and was pushed to the limit in each series,
while the Sparks swept Seattle and Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Pick: Sparks in three.</TE>

<HD>Eye on the Storm</HD>
<DH>Events in Munich forever changed Games, and how TV presents
them</DH>
<SE>First in a series remembering 1972 Summer Olympic games in
Munich, Germany</SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The terrorist in white hat and sunglasses, the one called Issa, steps
onto the balcony and threatens to kill another hostage.</LD>
<LD>   This is what we recall.</LD>
<LD>   A girl named Olga smiles in a perfectly girlish way, in pigtails.
A day before, she stood in tears but now she is triumphant, throwing
her hands into the air to wave at the crowd.</LD>
<TE>   The memory endures.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty years later, we call to mind the ruthless contrast of fear
and joy at the 1972 Olympic Games in much the same way a television
set works, in vibrant bits and pieces, electrons bombarding the small
screen of our consciousness, causing tiny phosphors to glow in
excitement.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, television pictures flicker in rapid fragments. Part
of the picture appears, the phosphors on screen instantly fall dark,
then another part is illuminated. The human eye has a way of
connecting the dots so that we see a coherent image, a phenomenon
known as persistence of vision.</TE>
<TE>   The Munich Games possessed this quality. Persistence of vision.</TE>
<TE>   The massacre of 11 Israeli team members by Palestinian terrorists.
The elfin Olga Korbut. Mark Spitz with seven gold medals dangling
around his neck. Valery Borzov sprinting. Jim Ryun falling. The
Soviet basketball team defeating the United States in a muddled,
controversial game.</TE>
<TE>   These were the grandest Olympics to date, with the most nations
and events, the most athletes. Even more significant, they were the
most televised, ABC paying dearly to broadcast more than 60 hours
back to America.</TE>
<TE>   The network offered a different style of coverage, a storytelling
approach it had pioneered on Saturday afternoon telecasts of "Wide
World of Sports." As an executive said beforehand: "We're going into
the Olympic Village for the first time and, if something
controversial happens, we'll report it."</TE>
<TE>   The stage was set. For better or worse, Munich delivered.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the Games began, they were expected to be the
most-watched event in history with an estimated 1 billion viewers, an
astounding total considering that only 300 million had watched the
first moon landing three years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Satellite time was purchased on Comsat's Atlantic "bird" to beam
three hours of prime-time coverage to the United States each
weeknight. Technicians had new equipment that allowed them to process
1,200 hours of action over roughly two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   ABC would use this technology to combine anchor Jim McKay's
narrative style with the wisdom of Roone Arledge, then president of
ABC Sports, who insisted the Olympics were not about running and
jumping, but about people. Give the viewer a rooting interest, he
said. In the years leading up to the Games, network executives
traveled to Germany more than 20 times to negotiate for this kind of
broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   "My biggest problem was insisting that ABC bring its own cameras,"
Chuck Howard, an ABC vice president, told The Times in 1972. "The
Germans fought this concept in the beginning, but relented. Our
argument is that we wanted to 'Americanize' our coverage--dwell more
on individuals if the situation requires it."</TE>
<TE>   The most likely candidate was Spitz, the California swimmer with
mustachioed good looks. Though he had failed to make good on his
brash predictions at Mexico City four years earlier, he arrived in
Munich certain to be the star of the U.S. team. That made him ABC's
star.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark really made our coverage," said Donna de Varona, a network
reporter at the Games. "We'd build the story every night: Is he going
to win? Every night for a week."</TE>
<TE>   By the time Spitz collected a record seventh gold medal, his every
stroke analyzed on screen, he was a household name. A whirlwind tour
awaited him back home--a pin-up poster and endorsements, TV
appearances with Sonny and Cher and Bob Hope--a fame that expired
just as quickly when critics realized his deadpan personality was
ill-suited to stardom.</TE>
<TE>   But in the water, Spitz was electric enough to carry the Munich
telecasts. And he had help from an unexpected co-star.</TE>
<TE>   Decades later, fans might forget Lyudmila Tourischeva was the
leader of the Soviet gymnastic team and winner of the all-around gold
medal. They might forget because the previously unknown Korbut
snatched the spotlight even as she slipped on the uneven bars to
finish seventh in the all-around.</TE>
<TE>   Korbut was made for television, a pixie with bright eyes and
unfettered emotion.</TE>
<TE>   "When Olga missed on the bars and started to cry, people in the
stands started to cry," said Olympic filmmaker Bud Greenspan, a radio
reporter at those Games. "People saw that on television, it was like
the whole world mourned with her."</TE>
<TE>   And, as Greenspan recalled, "ABC played her to the hilt."</TE>
<TE>   Four years earlier, a Czech gymnast named Vera Caslavska had
charmed Mexican fans with a dazzling performance that went largely
untelevised and unnoticed. This time, Arledge wanted the camera to
shadow Korbut around the gymnastics hall, focusing on that beaming
face as she completed a rags-to-riches story, winning two individual
golds.</TE>
<TE>   "You had Americans falling in love with Olga," historian David
Wallechinsky said. "The difference was television."</TE>
<TE>   Young gymnasts would thereafter be coached to smile and wave.
Television producers would recognize gymnastics as a means of
attracting more female viewers. Beyond the realm of sport, Korbut put
an unexpected face on America's arch enemy.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a culturally dour presence that a lot of the [Soviets]
had," said Robert Edelman, author of "Serious Fun: A History of
Spectator Sports in the USSR."</TE>
<TE>   "Here is this person who was vivacious and smiled and seemed to be
an individual. She did not fit the mold."</TE>
<TE>   Korbut later visited the White House, where President Nixon
reportedly commented that she had done more to defuse the Cold War
than all the meetings in Washington and Moscow combined.</TE>
<TE>   On the heels of Marshall McLuhan's suggestion that television
would reduce the planet to a "global village," the medium had given
the Games worldwide prominence.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a turning point," Wallechinsky said. "So many more
people are watching. Everyone's TV is tuned to the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   This popularity did not go unnoticed by members of Black
September, the violent Palestinian faction desperate for attention in
the early 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "That has been one of the theories that groups want to speak to
the world through the media," said Richard H. Dekmejian, a USC
political science professor who studies terrorism. "They could bring
to the attention of the world their grievance in the form of a
vengeance attack. The world would see it."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the terrorists saw the notoriety U.S. athletes Tommie Smith
and John Carlos achieved by raising their fists in a Black Power
salute on the medals stand at Mexico City. Maybe they knew the Munich
Games promised an even bigger stage.</TE>
<TE>   In the early hours of Sept. 5, eight Black September commandos
scaled a fence at the Olympic Village and broke into an apartment
complex where the Israeli team slept.</TE>
<TE>   McKay later recalled being awakened that morning by a knock on the
door and a message that something extraordinary had occurred in the
village. Awaiting directions from his producers, he went downstairs
at the Sheraton-Munich Hotel to take a sauna and swim. Upon
returning, he learned the details of the attack and hurried to the
network's broadcast center, still wearing damp trunks under his
clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Two Israelis were dead and the terrorists, demanding the release
of comrades in Israeli jails, were threatening to kill more.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of 21 unblinking hours, viewers came to know Issa
and another terrorist, Tony, who most often emerged to talk with West
German officials. They caught glimpses of an Israeli captive led to a
window to speak briefly with negotiators.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, the coverage switched to a sporting event in
progress. McKay noted the volleyball match, then murmured: "And now
back to the real world." Later, police aborted a raid when they
realized their movements across the rooftops were being televised.</TE>
<TE>   The ordeal ended past midnight when all the hostages, five
terrorists and a police officer were killed in a gun battle at a
nearby airport. By then, Arledge had cemented his reputation--he was
later promoted to president of news--and McKay would be remembered
for the simple, haunting line: "They're all gone." Cameras showed a
grim-faced Spitz being whisked away in a car, sent home early because
he was Jewish and officials feared for his safety.</TE>
<TE>   In one respect, Dekmejian believes the captors failed to achieve
their goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans were told the meanness and nastiness of the terrorists
but not why they did this," said the professor, who still uses Munich
footage in a class on terrorism. "Television didn't have the time or
inclination to cover the root of the Palestinian situation. So it
backfired against them."</TE>
<TE>   Yet it was shown worldwide with cameras ABC had rolled out of its
broadcast center and it succeeded in giving Americans an
unprecedented look at such violence. It also succeeded in cementing
Munich's dubious legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "From that point on, there was no avoiding that the Olympics were
going to be a target, not because they were the Olympics but because
the whole world was watching," Wallechinsky said. "The African
boycott of '76, the U.S. boycott of '80, the Soviet boycott of
'84--all of them came from the unfortunate propaganda success of the
'72 Games."</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 6, television covered a somber memorial from the
gossamer-tented main stadium that a week earlier had played host to
the opening ceremony of the so-called "Games of Joy."</TE>
<TE>   There was a move afoot to cancel the remaining events but the
International Olympic Committee was reeling financially--with the
troubled Montreal Olympics still to come--and Greenspan says, "If the
Games had been canceled then, they never would have been renewed."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to continue was, depending on the point of view, a
testament to human spirit or an example of misplaced values. In
either case, the final days provided a few more memories.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed never-ending," said Geoffrey Mason, ABC's coordinating
producer. "We'd get to the broadcast center and wonder what was going
to happen next."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the earlier drama had taken place on the track, where
Lasse Viren had recovered from a fall to set a world record in the
10,000 meters and Borzov had won the title of "world's fastest man"
with victories in the 100 and 200 meters. The closing days would be
no different.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1,500 meters, an administrative error matched defending
champion Kip Keino against world-record holder Ryun in the opening
round. The long-awaited showdown ended badly for Ryun, who tripped
while squeezing through the pack and fell hard, lying dazed on the
track. Keino won the heat and eventually the silver medal.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans fared better as the competition stretched into
Monday to compensate for a day of mourning. On Sept. 10, Frank
Shorter became the first U.S. marathon winner since 1908. Yet even
this victory was momentarily tainted as Shorter entered the stadium
to a chorus of boos. Unbeknownst to him, fans were jeering an
impostor who had run onto the track minutes earlier and been hustled
away by security.</TE>
<TE>   That day brought another event that, if not for the terrorist
attack, might have been remembered as the blackest mark on these
Games.</TE>
<TE>   The men's basketball final actually began the night before, tipoff
delayed until 11:45 p.m. to accommodate U.S. television.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans entered the game with a 62-0 record in Olympic
competition but knew their Soviet opponent had closed the
international gap.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans trailed for most of the game before a furious rally,
and two free throws by Doug Collins gave them a 50-49 lead with three
seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Chaos ensued.</TE>
<TE>   Soviet coaches charged onto the court, arguing that their request
for a timeout had gone ignored. The game resumed with one second left
and the USSR failed to score, sending the U.S. team into celebration,
but an official came from the stands and ordered three seconds put
back on the clock.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Aleksandr Belov scored off a long pass. The Americans
lost a protest and bitterly refused to accept their silver medals. In
"The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics," Wallechinsky
characterizes the finish as "one of the greatest controversies in the
history of international sports."</TE>
<TE>   Two decades later, in an interview with Sports Illustrated, U.S.
player Kenny Davis added perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I get to feeling sorry for myself, I think of the
Israeli kids who were killed at those Games," Davis said. "If the
final game is the worst injustice that ever happens to the guys on
that team, we'll all come out of this life pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   The world might never witness another Olympics like the one that
transpired in the summer of 1972.</TE>
<TE>   Other Games have suffered political unrest and acts of violence
but organizers now spend hundreds of millions on security and, save
for the bomb that exploded in an Atlanta park in 1996, nothing has
approached the bloodshed of the "Munich Massacre."</TE>
<TE>   On the playing fields, other Games have produced what Greenspan
calls "the standard procedure ... a lot of great performances and a
lot of controversy." But, as De Varona said, "Munich was one story
after another, hugely memorable. It wasn't a sports festival, it was
something bigger."</TE>
<TE>   And it was shown to us in a memorable way.</TE>
<TE>   At the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern, professor
Joseph Angotti complains that Olympic coverage in this country has
sunk into a morass, Arledge's concept taken to the extreme with too
many prepackaged vignettes, too many events tape-delayed and shown
hours, even days, later.</TE>
<TE>   "It has a very practiced, very predictable feel," the chair of the
broadcast program and former NBC executive said. "It's the canned
music, the over-dramatized scenes of people walking into the sunset."</TE>
<TE>   Munich was different. It was unnervingly unscripted, viewers drawn
into a remarkable convergence of events. "The New York Times and Los
Angeles Times could have written endless stories about Olga Korbut
and it would not have had the same impact as watching her perform
those feats live," Angotti said.</TE>
<TE>   As Wallechinsky put it: "When you see a person's face, that makes
a big difference. Particularly if you see the emotions changing."</TE>
<TE>   This is what we recall.</TE>
<TE>   Tears transformed into a smile, impossibly wide and bright for
Korbut's small face, her crinkled nose. The unfathomable
juxtaposition of Issa's dark features, shadowed by his floppy cap,
his gestures growing more urgent as nightfall approached.</TE>
<TE>   Fragments of images flicker across our collective memory.
Persistence of vision. Thirty years later, the phosphors still burn
brightly.</TE>

<TE>   From Berlin to Munich ...</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-six years before, as the 1936 Summer Olympics opened in
Berlin's Olympic Stadium, the Greek shepherd who won the first
marathon of the modern Olympics in 1896 presented Adolf Hitler with
an olive twig plucked from Mt. Olympus. "I give to you this olive
branch as a symbol of love and peace," Spiridon Loues told the
Fuehrer. "We hope that the nations will ever meet solely in such
peaceful competition." It was reported that Hitler almost cried.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, the Olympics returned to Germany with the opening
ceremony at the Munich Olympic Stadium. Athletes from 121 nations
marched. An 18-year-old West German policeman, Guenther Zahn, was the
final torchbearer. But there was little other visible police presence
as Munich tried to distance itself from the militarism that had been
so pervasive in Berlin. They were supposed to be the "Games of Joy."
They proved anything but.</TE>

POSTSCRIPT</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   She was 38 and had given birth to her four children by the time of
the 1972 Olympics. But Olga Connolly, famous for so many things
Olympic, made the U.S. team again in the discus.</TE>
<TE>   It would be her fifth Games, and her last moment on the
international sports stage. But as in all things with Connolly, it
would not be a quiet goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   "Things with me always get so complicated," she said last week. "I
make them that way."</TE>
<TE>   In 1956, Olga Fikotova traveled from her home in Czechoslovakia to
the Melbourne Olympics, won the gold medal and fell in love with U.S.
hammer thrower Harold Connolly. She moved to California, got married,
had her children and kept on throwing the discus at an international
level, despite never winning another Olympic medal.</TE>
<TE>   By the time she qualified for the U.S. team again in '72, she had
become one of the world's leading athletic spokespersons. In the
early '70s, she spoke out against the war in Vietnam. She belonged to
a group called Another Mother for Peace. The early '70s were not a
time when stodgy Olympic officials easily accepted outspoken
athletes.</TE>
<TE>   What really made them nervous was when the other U.S. Olympic
sport captains elected Connolly to carry the U.S. flag into the
opening ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Olympic Committee heard I had been elected to carry the
flag, they were silent for about five minutes," said Connolly, now
68, divorced since 1973 and a resident of Newport Beach. "Our
marching orders had been pretty clear going into those Games. Bring
lots of medals home and stay away from politics.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course I couldn't do that."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Olympic officials, Connolly said, failed to tell her about an
opening ceremony rehearsal, almost causing her to lose her chance to
carry the flag. Then there was some discussion that the flag was too
heavy for a woman to carry all the way around the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   That discussion further inspired Connolly to not only carry the
flag, but do so one-handed.</TE>
<TE>   "When I finished and finally left the stadium, everybody kind of
dispersed," she recalled, "and it was an empty feeling. I wanted to
share this with somebody, and there was nobody around.</TE>
<TE>   "So ... I ran into the Associated Press building and told them I
wanted to tell my story and they let me dictate what I had to say
into a machine. And the story went out.</TE>
<TE>   "The next day, the headline in the New York Times said: 'THE FLAG
BELONGS TO EVERYBODY.' "</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dario Franchitti took advantage of Cristiano da Matta's strategic
gamble Sunday to win the inaugural Montreal Molson Indy.</LD>
<LD>   An early pit stop by da Matta, the runaway CART series points
leader, opened the door for Franchitti, who pulled away after a
late-race restart to win the 80-lap race at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve
by 2.588 seconds--about half the last straightaway.</LD>
<LD>   Da Matta started from the pole for the seventh time in 13 races
this season and was shooting for his seventh victory, but after an
early caution flag, his Newman-Haas Racing team decided to bring him
in for an extra stop on Lap 12.</LD>
<TE>   "It was similar to the strategy that we ran in fuel strategy races
last year," the Brazilian driver said. "Most any other times that
strategy would have won us the race. If any yellow had happened at
any time except the last 10 laps, the race would have come back to
us."</TE>
<TE>   Franchitti and da Matta swapped the lead several times on pit
stops and it appeared the Scottish driver, who made his last stop on
Lap 63, was home free when he found himself out front by nearly five
seconds after da Matta made his final stop on Lap 68.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pole sitter Gil de Ferran won his second IRL race of the season,
beating teammate Helio Castroneves to the finish line in the IRL
Gateway 250 at Madison, Ill., and moving within a point of the lead
in the overall standings.</TE>
<TE>   Castroneves leads the series with 437 points, one more than de
Ferran. Sam Hornish Jr., who led the standings heading into Sunday,
finished fifth and dropped 18 points back at 429. But all three
drivers remain in contention for the title. First place is worth 50
points, second 45, third 40.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Thailand's Paradorn Srichaphan won his first ATP Tour title,
beating Argentina's Juan Ignacio Chela, 5-7, 6-2, 6-2, in the TD
Waterhouse Cup at Commack, N.Y. The 23-year-old Srichaphan, playing
in his second consecutive final and third of the year, has won 10 of
his last 11 matches heading into the U.S. Open. He earned $51,500.</TE>
<TE>   Srichaphan is the first Asian to win an ATP Tour singles title
since Leander Paes in 1998 at Newport, R.I.</TE>

<TE>   Michael Phelps of Irvine and Natalie Coughlin each won gold medals
to lead a dominant performance by the U.S. swim team at the Pan

<TE>   Phelps, the 17-year-old world record-holder in the 400 individual
medley, won in a meet-record 4 minutes, 12.48 seconds. USC's Erik
Vendt was second in 4:13.15.</TE>

<TE>   Miller, a five-time All-Star who plays for the Indiana Pacers,
came down awkwardly on his ankle when he was fouled by Stefano Garris
early in the third quarter. Miller did not return. The exhibition
game was a tuneup for the World Championships starting Thursday in
Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   All-Star forward Dirk Nowitzki of the Dallas Mavericks led Germany
with 23 points.</TE>
<TE>   Baron Davis, bothered by back spasms in practices Friday and
Saturday, started Sunday night, and Elton Brand, who missed an

<TE>   Stan Dzidezic, president of USA Wrestling, said the Iranian
government could not guarantee the delegation's safety in the face of
anti-American sentiment in Iran.</TE>
<TE>   USA Wrestling's executive committee asked the sport's

<DL></DL>
<LD>Pittsburgh Steeler wide receiver Hines Ward is out of the hospital
after having an appendectomy.</LD>
<LD>   Ward was taken to UPMC-Presbyterian hospital Friday night after
experiencing pain before the Steelers' flight to Detroit for
Saturday's exhibition game.</LD>
<LD>   Ward's appendix was removed shortly after he arrived at the
hospital and he was released Saturday night.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a very good procedure," Steeler Coach Bill Cowher said.
"It was not ruptured. It was very clean."</TE>
<TE>   Cowher is cautiously optimistic Ward will play in the season
opener Sept. 9 at New England. Ward, who went to the Pro Bowl last
season, has played in all 64 regular-season games and two playoff
games since the Steelers drafted him in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   If Ward cannot play, rookie Antwaan Randle El is expected to
start. Randle El scored a 29-yard touchdown in the Steelers' 34-22
victory against the Lions.</TE>

<TE>   Atlanta Falcon quarterback Michael Vick's bruised right elbow will
not keep him from playing in the Falcons' exhibition finale against
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   The Falcons play the Bengals on Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   Vick, a left-handed passer, did not return after getting sacked in
the second quarter of a 21-19 win at Dallas on Saturday night. X-rays
taken at Texas Stadium were negative.</TE>
<TE>   Vick completed three of six passes for 17 yards and scrambled once
for a first down against the Cowboys. He was not sacked in the first
two exhibition games, but was sacked twice Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Terry Glenn hopes to make his Packer debut tonight
when Green Bay plays the Cleveland Browns. The wide receiver has been
sidelined by a sprained left knee, but he participated in the
Packers' Sunday practice.</TE>

<TE>   New York Giant quarterback Kerry Collins, who injured his
shoulder, and halfback Tiki Barber, who injured his hamstring, are
expected to be ready for the Giants' season opener against San
Francisco. Both were hurt in the Giants' 28-7 loss to the New York
Jets on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steve Spurrier won't be keeping all of the former Florida players
he invited to the Washington Redskin training camp. Former Gator
receiver Reidel Anthony was one of seven players cut Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony, signed as a free agent in March after spending five
seasons with Tampa Bay, lost ground at camp to fellow ex-Florida
receivers Jacquez Green and Chris Doering. Spurrier has said he
expects to keep six receivers, and Rod Gardner, Kevin Lockett,
Derrius Thompson, Darnerien McCants, Green and Doering are now the
favorites to make the final cut.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 49er starting linebacker Jeff Ulbrich will be out
three to six weeks after hyperextending his right knee in Saturday's
17-10 exhibition loss to Oakland. Ulbrich, a third-year pro, started
14 games last season and finished second on the 49ers with 92
tackles.... Jerry Wunsch, a starter on Tampa Bay's offensive line the
last three seasons, was among 13 players released by the Buccaneers.</TE>

<HD>Saarloos Sinks His Problems</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some extended work on the side paid off for rookie Kirk Saarloos.</LD>
<LD>   Saarloos had struggled in his previous three starts with an 8.22
earned-run average over 15 1/3 innings. But he gave up only four hits
in seven innings Sunday to lead the Houston Astros over the
Cincinnati Reds, 1-0, at Houston.</LD>
<LD>   Lance Berkman accounted for the only run with his career-high 35th
homer.</LD>
<TE>   Saarloos (6-3) struck out five and walked two, winning for the
first time in three decisions since Aug. 10. He had won five starts
in a row before his recent struggles.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I have my problems worked out," said Saarloos, who
retired 10 consecutive batters from the fourth through seventh
innings.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked on it in the bullpen on Friday and threw about 75-80%
sinkers during that workout," he said. "I found the one thing that
makes my sinker click. I just have to slow down and make sure I don't
pull my shoulder open too soon."</TE>
<TE>   For a pitcher whose fastball runs in the mid-80s, getting the
sinker to sink is important.</TE>
<TE>   "Saarloos is the type of guy whose mechanics have to be sound,"
pitching coach Burt Hooton said. "He has to be just right to get the
sink on his sinker. He worked on that in the bullpen and it helped a
lot. His pitches were as sharp today as they have been all year."</TE>
<TE>   The Reds were certainly impressed. Especially Aaron Boone, who
struck out swinging in the fifth inning and angrily tossed his bat to
the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Dunn got a single off Saarloos in the fourth inning, but
struck out the other two times he faced him.</TE>
<TE>   "He has so much movement on the ball and he was keeping it down,"
Dunn said. "He had a real good sinker today and a real good changeup.
He kept us off-balance. He's got some good stuff. He reminds me of
Greg Maddux."</TE>
<TE>   Pedro Borbon finished, striking out three batters in the ninth,
and got his first save since Aug. 20, 2000, for Toronto at Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Dempster (7-13) gave up two hits and four walks in seven
innings, giving up the first-inning homer to Berkman. Dempster is 2-5
in nine starts since Cincinnati acquired him from Florida on July 11.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 8, Montreal 4--Barry Bonds doubled twice and scored
two runs, and Jason Schmidt got his second victory on the homestand
as the Giants won at San Francisco. Benito Santiago drove in three
runs and J.T. Snow drove in two as the Giants avoided a series sweep
by scoring more than three runs for the first time since Aug. 13.</TE>
<TE>   Vladimir Guerrero got three hits and stole two bases for the
Expos, but Javier Vazquez (8-11) lost his fifth consecutive start,
giving up eight hits and six runs over 5 1/3 lackluster innings.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 7, San Diego 6--Luis Castillo singled in the go-ahead run
in the eighth inning as the Marlins won their first road series in
more than two months with a win at San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Padre pinch-runner Trenidad Hubbard was thrown out at the plate
trying to score the potential tying run on a pitch that got away from
Florida catcher Charles Johnson in the bottom of the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Millar homered and drove in three runs for the Marlins. Juan
Encarnacion hit a solo homer, his 20th, a career high.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 5, St. Louis 3--Placido Polanco beat his former team
with a go-ahead single in the ninth and the Phillies won at St. Louis
for their first sweep at Busch Stadium since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco, traded from the Cardinals to Philadelphia last month in
the deal for Scott Rolen, singled off Jason Isringhausen (2-2) after
singles by Bobby Abreu and Travis Lee for a 4-3 lead. Jeremy Giambi
walked with the bases loaded to add a run.</TE>
<TE>   Marlon Anderson and Pat Burrell homered as Philadelphia won its
fifth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   New York 7, Colorado 4--Raul Gonzalez hit his first two major
league home runs and had four runs batted in to lead Al Leiter and
the Mets at Colorado. Edgardo Alfonzo also homered and had three RBIs
for the Mets, who have won two in a row after a 12-game losing skid.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 3, Milwaukee 2--Kris Benson pitched eight solid innings
and Rob Mackowiak homered as the Pirates won at Milwaukee. Aramis
Ramirez's sacrifice fly snapped a seventh-inning tie as the Brewers
lost for the fifth consecutive time.</TE>

<HD>Johnson Heats Up, Fans 16 in No. 19</HD>
<DH>Baseball: With his fastball in 100-mph range, Arizona
left-hander beats Cubs, 7-0, to move closer to 20 wins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Even by his own incredible standards, Randy Johnson was bringing it
Sunday. His fastball has never been faster. His slider topped out at
90 mph.</LD>
<LD>   "I just woke up today and I was a power pitcher," he said, "you
know, lo and behold."</LD>
<LD>   Johnson struck out 16 to earn his 19th victory as the Arizona
Diamondbacks beat the Chicago Cubs, 7-0.</LD>
<TE>   "Velocity alone, this was by far his best game of the season,"
Arizona Manager Bob Brenly said. "We had him at 102 mph on the
strikeout pitch to end the seventh. He hit 100 two other times, 99
two times and 98 seven times."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's win total is second in the majors to teammate Curt
Schilling's 21. He scattered six hits and walked two to improve to
11-0 in 12 starts against the Cubs, who were missing Sammy Sosa
because of a sore neck.</TE>
<TE>   In seven starts since giving up eight runs in five innings of a
loss at San Diego, Johnson is 6-0 with a 0.90 earned-run average and
87 strikeouts in 57 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "I just feel like I'm locked in," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson (19-4) reached double-digit strikeouts for the sixth
consecutive start. The shutout was Johnson's third this year--second
in five starts--and 33rd of his career. He struck out four in a row
twice in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "That's as dominating as I've seen him," Arizona catcher Chad
Moeller said. "Sixteen strikeouts, and he said it, he didn't realize
how hard he was throwing in the last inning. I'm looking up at the
board and I see 99 up there. I mean it's unbelievable what that guy
is capable of."</TE>
<TE>   Alex Gonzalez tripled with one out in the ninth, but Johnson
fanned Chad Hermansen and Joe Girardi to preserve the shutout. The 16
strikeouts were one short of Johnson's season high.</TE>
<TE>   Erubiel Durazo ended an 0-for-8 drought with an RBI triple in the
fourth inning for the only run Johnson needed. Durazo scored on a
single by Matt Williams. Johnson added a two-run single in a five-run
eighth, and Williams had another RBI single.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks finished their homestand 5-1 and have won 26 of
their last 32 games overall. They are 32-11 since the All-Star break.</TE>

<HD>Raider Otto Battles Cancer</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Hall of Fame center, in advanced stage of
disease, has been undergoing radiation treatment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Jim Otto, the Pro Football Hall of Fame center who has been a Raider
fixture since the 1960s, is battling advanced prostate cancer and has
lost 35 pounds in three months.</LD>
<LD>   "A couple years ago, with readings like mine, you would have had
six months to live," said Otto, 64. "[But] we've got a way of
fighting it, and we're going to kick its butt."</LD>
<LD>   Otto, pale and slender after weeks of radiation treatments,
attended an exhibition game Saturday between the Raiders and 49ers,
assuming his usual seat in the luxury suite of Raider owner Al Davis.</LD>
<TE>   After the game, the two men visited the locker room as they
normally do.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't miss a game against the 49ers," said Otto, who started
in a franchise-record 210 games in a Raider career that stretched
from 1960 though '74. "When I was a young guy, this was a game I very
much looked forward to. I never did like the 49ers when I was a kid."</TE>
<TE>   Otto stood and spoke for several minutes--interrupted only when
gigantic tackle Lincoln Kennedy gave him a smothering hug--and
finally Davis wandered over to remind him not to get overtired.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a terrible thing," Davis said of Otto's illness.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and Otto are close friends, inseparable at Raider games at
home and on the road. The two have been close since Otto's playing
days, when he participated in nine AFL All-Star games and the first
three AFC-NFC Pro Bowls. Last month, Otto accompanied Davis to the
Hall of Fame induction ceremony at Canton, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Jim is an even greater person than he was a football
player or leader," former Raider safety Jack Tatum said. "All of us
younger players looked up to him. We thought, if this old guy can go
out and never loaf or never dog it, we've got to put out, so we can
be at his level."</TE>
<TE>   Legendary for his toughness, Otto has undergone 40 surgeries since
he began playing football, including 30 on his knees. He is on his
sixth artificial right knee and his second artificial left knee. Both
his shoulders are artificial.</TE>
<TE>   He survived two major infections in the last five years that
nearly killed him, complications that arose when his artificial knees
were removed. Once, his temperature hovered around 105 degrees for
eight consecutive days.</TE>
<TE>   "I can take any type of surgery in the world, except something
that's internal," he said. "Cosmetic--fixing your nose, fixing your
knee, fixing your elbow--that's nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Otto said his doctors have known for five years his prostate has
been enlarged but did not want to do a biopsy on it because he is
predisposed to infections. Finally, in April, they performed the
biopsy and discovered the malignancy.</TE>
<TE>   He has been undergoing radiation and hormone treatments at a UC
Davis hospital and has altered his diet, which accounts for part of
his weight loss. He's down to 222 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not afraid of anything," he said. "There's nothing to be
scared of. I'm a Christian man, so that gives me a lot of strength
and a lot of faith. I've got a lot of great doctors working on me.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to die. Well, someday I will."</TE>

<HD>Angel Fans Miss the Signals</HD>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Tried to find the Angel-Red Sox game on TV, didn't you? Found the
White Sox-Devil Ray game. Bet that had you glued to the tube.</LD>
<LD>   But the Angels-Red Sox? Two teams battling for American League
division titles and wild-card position? At a sold-out Fenway Park?
That game wasn't televised in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   These Fightin' Angels deserve better. A team owned by a media
conglomerate should use some muscle to get the biggest game of the
season on television. Why should fans come out in sellout numbers if
ownership can't get its team on television? Do you think George
Steinbrenner would stand for this, having a Yankee-Red Sox Sunday
afternoon game not on television?</LD>
<TE>   Why should fans watch TV this week when all three home games
against the Devil Rays will be televised if they can't watch a road
game played in a historic park between two teams in a tense playoff
battle?</TE>
<TE>   On a Sunday when there was no regular-season NFL football, no
Grand Slam golf or tennis tournament, no Tour de France or Ryder Cup
or any other momentous sporting occasion, the Angels still couldn't
get on TV.</TE>
<TE>   The Channel 9 crew was here.</TE>
<TE>   Rex Hudler was running people over as he galloped through the glum
Boston crowd after the Angels, with a rookie pitcher going against an
All-Star, won, 8-3, by scoring five times in the top of the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   "Wasn't it a great game?" Hudler shouted.</TE>
<TE>   And wouldn't it have been great to have seen it live, heard Hudler
live in all his full-blown, charmingly-Angel homerism?</TE>
<TE>   Live, that's another thing. Tonight's Red Sox-Angel game, the
final one of this critical four-game series, will be televised by
Channel 9. On tape delay. And on KLAC (570). On tape delay.
Tape-delay television, that's understandable. A little. But
tape-delay radio? Even the Sparks get live radio broadcasts!</TE>
<TE>   Here's what Channel 9 showed Sunday instead of the Angels-Red Sox:</TE>
<TE>   "An Hour of Power."</TE>
<TE>   This while Mickey Callaway, a 27-year-old rookie was making his
first start for the Angels and his fifth major league start.
Callaway, just called up from triple A, was going against Boston
All-Star Derek Lowe, fighting through a bases-loaded, one-out
situation in the first, only giving up one run. Callaway once pitched
for Tampa Bay. If he was still with the sad-sack Devil Rays, he would
have been on local TV.</TE>
<TE>   By the time "Feed the Children" came on an hour later, Callaway
was gingerly making his way into the sixth inning, giving up only one
more earned run. Meanwhile, his new teammates were scrapping out
their third run in the top of the fifth on David Eckstein's leadoff
infield single and stolen base, Darin Erstad's sacrifice and Orlando
Palmeiro's RBI single. Little things done well, something for the
Little Leaguers to learn from.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, wait. We see way more of the Little Leaguers than the Angels.
Louisville star Zach Osborne has more face time in Anaheim than
Callaway.</TE>
<TE>   About the time of a half-hour of paid programming, Callaway was
finishing his outing by getting two groundouts and a pop out around a
walk. He'd kept the Angels in this thing, score tied, 3-3.</TE>
<TE>   While the "Black Forum" consumed the next half hour, the game
settled into a tense rhythm. Three up, three down for the Angels
against Lowe.</TE>
<TE>   And same for the Red Sox against middle reliever Brendan Donnelly,
another one of those surprising Angel finds, as the station segued
into a half hour of "Crime Strike." It was a one-two-three eighth for
both teams too. Steady Scott Schoeneweis had taken over for Donnelly.
Lowe kept hanging in for the Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, it was during "Animal Adventures" when the Angels scored
five times. Scott Spiezio started it with a single and Manager Mike
Scioscia pulled him for Chone Figgins, 24, just called up from Salt
Lake City to take Tim Salmon's place on the roster. Figgins went to
third on Shawn Wooten's pinch-hit, hit-and-run single, then scored
the eventual winning run on Eckstein's squeeze. The Angels added four
more runs in the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't on TV?" Scioscia said after the game? "Huh?"</TE>
<TE>   The official explanation is that ESPN had designated this game at
the start of the year as a possibility for its Sunday night game. Two
weeks ago, ESPN (owned by Disney, which owns the Angels), chose the
Dodger-Brave game for national television. That left the Red
Sox-Angels up for grabs.</TE>
<TE>   In Boston, the local Fox station managed to sell ads and televise
the game. In Southern California, no deal.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net had a rerun of the "Best Damn Sports Show Period,"
Major League Lacrosse playoffs and "Beyond the Glory" looking at
Lawrence Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   This would be funny. Except it's sad.</TE>
<TE>   The most entertaining team in the game, with a roster of more
underpaid overachievers than overpaid underachievers, exists in a
tape-delayed media vacuum and everybody seems to shrug their
shoulders, make excuses and say, "That's just the way it is."</TE>
<TE>   The manager and players get called on it when they make excuses.
The ownership owes this manager and these players and all the fans
fewer excuses. And more television.</TE>

<HD>South Korean Defender Wants to Join Galaxy</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>South Korea's World Cup captain, defender Hong Myung-Bo, has said
that he wants to join the Galaxy "as soon as possible," despite the
fact that his contract with the Pohang Steelers of the Korean league
runs through the end of 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Major League Soccer and Galaxy officials will meet with their
K-League and Steeler counterparts in South Korea this week in an
effort to bring Hong, 34, to MLS, if not this season then next year,
when the Galaxy moves from the Rose Bowl to its new stadium in
Carson.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the most crucial moment in my football life," Hong
recently told Radio Korea in Los Angeles. "Personally, how much money
I'm going to receive is not a big matter.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to remain in club football, while learning English to
build my career as a coach in the future. At this point, MLS is one
such solution.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to join the Galaxy as soon as possible, if I can."</TE>
<TE>   Hiddink's Return</TE>
<TE>   Guus Hiddink, the Dutch coach who led South Korea to the World Cup
semifinals, will return to Seoul on Sept. 4 to sign an agreement as
national team advisor, the Korea Football Assn. said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   While in Seoul, Hiddink will attend the match between South Korea
and North Korea on Sept. 7, the first game between the two countries
since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Korea's Turkish Gain</TE>
<TE>   The soccer ties between South Korea and Turkey that first surfaced
during the World Cup have been further strengthened by the
appointment of former Turkey national team coach Tinaz Tirpan as
coach of Bucheon in the K-League.</TE>
<TE>   Tirpan, 61, will earn a reported $20,000 per month.</TE>
<TE>   Bucheon also has reached an agreement with the Turkish club
Genclerbirligi under which 25 young Korean players with potential
will train in Ankara, Turkey. More than 500 have asked to be
considered.</TE>
<TE>   Libyan Adventure</TE>
<TE>   Italian champion Juventus won the Italian Super Cup by beating
Parma, 2-1, in an unusual locale Sunday--the match being played in
Tripoli, Libya.</TE>
<TE>   Goals by Italy national team striker Alessandro Del Piero in the
37th and 74th minutes were enough to earn Juventus the victory,
although Parma's Marco Di Vaio did tie the score briefly with a
64th-minute goal.</TE>
<TE>   More than 45,000 fans turned out at the June 11 Stadium and
included Joseph "Sepp" Blatter, FIFA's president, and Al-Saadi
Gadhafi, the son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.</TE>
<TE>   Deportivo Claims Cup</TE>
<TE>   Deportivo Coruna won the Spanish Super Cup on Sunday by defeating
Valencia, 1-0, in Valencia on a 90th-minute goal by midfielder Victor
to complete a two-game series sweep of last season's Spanish league
champions.</TE>
<TE>   Deportivo, winner of the Spanish Cup last season, won the first
game at home, 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   Valencia played most of the game with only 10 men after Argentine
defender Roberto Ayala was ejected for elbowing Deportivo's Dutch
striker, Roy Makaay, in the third minute.</TE>
<TE>   The game is the traditional curtain-raiser to the Spanish season,
which begins Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Bagheri Heads Home</TE>
<TE>   Iran national team striker Karim Bagheri has signed a one-year
contract with Iranian league champion Pirouzi, after spending the
last two seasons with clubs in Qatar and England, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Friedel, Keller Shine</TE>
<TE>   American World Cup goalkeepers Brad Friedel and Kasey Keller both
earned shutouts over the weekend for their respective English Premier
League teams.</TE>
<TE>   Friedel, who a week earlier had blanked Claudio Reyna's
Sunderland, this time held Birmingham scoreless, making key saves
against former MLS leading scorer Stern John. Trinidad and Tobago's
Dwight Yorke scored the lone goal in a 1-0 Blackburn victory.</TE>
<TE>   Keller, meanwhile, made his second consecutive start for Tottenham
Hotspur, where he had been benched much of last season, and shut out
Aston Villa, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Asprilla Sets Sights Low</TE>
<TE>   Colombian striker Faustino "Tino" Asprilla, a World Cup player in
1994 and 1998, has agreed to join Darlington of the English third
division, the lowest of England's four professional divisions.</TE>
<TE>   Asprilla, 32, whose former clubs include Newcastle United in
England, Parma in Italy and Palmeiras and Fluminense in Brazil, said
he was doing so out of friendship for Darlington's chairman, George
Reynolds.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to work with the team and help them win promotion," he
said. "I've kept good links with England. I have good friends there
and it would be great to play again in the Premier League."</TE>
<TE>   Asprilla apparently is hoping to catch the eye of nearby
Newcastle, the team he joined from Parma for $11.4 million in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   USA Falls to Brazil</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. under-20 national team was edged, 2-1, by Brazil in its
opening game of the XIX Torneo Internacional de Futbol de l'Alcudia
in Valencia, Spain. Midfielder David Johnson of Venice scored for the
Americans, who play Italy today and Ukraine on Tuesday in the same
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Women's Roster Named</TE>
<TE>   Coach April Heinrichs selected 24 players for the U.S. women's
national team that will play Scotland in Columbus, Ohio, on Sept. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Among those named was goalkeeper Siri Mullinix, who has not played
for the U.S. in more than a year, and defender Christie Pearce, who
is coming off surgery last year to repair torn knee ligaments. Both
players were silver medal winners at the Sydney 200 Olympic Games.</TE>
<TE>   The full roster:</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeepers: Mullinix, Hope Solo and Briana Scurry.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders: Pearce, LaKeysia Beene, Jenny Benson, Thori Bryan,
Brandi Chastain, Jena Kleugel, Heather Mills, Nandi Pryce, Danielle
Slayton and Kate Sobrero.</TE>
<TE>   Midfielders: Lorrie Fair, Julie Foudy, Angela Hucles, Kristine
Lilly, Tiffany Roberts and Stacey Tullock.</TE>
<TE>   Forwards: Danielle Fotopoulos, Mia Hamm, Shannon MacMillan, Cindy
Parlow and Abby Wambach.</TE>
<TE>   New Zealand Invited</TE>
<TE>   The Asian Football Confederation has proposed that the winner of
the soccer tournament at the Sept. 27-Oct. 13 Asian Games in Busan,
South Korea, play Oceania Football Confederation champion New Zealand
in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   If the proposed match goes ahead, it would be the second AFC/OFC
Challenge Cup. Japan won the first, defeating Australia, 3-0, in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Beckenbauer Blasted</TE>
<TE>   Franz Beckenbauer's criticism of former Bayern Munich and German
national team midfielder Stefan Effenberg was met by a stinging
response from the player Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Beckenbauer had suggested in print that Effenberg appeared so out
of shape when playing for his new club, VfL Wolfsburg, on Saturday
that his puffed cheeks made him look like "an angel blowing a horn."</TE>
<TE>   Effenberg was not amused.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't been taking seriously his remarks or commentaries for
the last two years," Effenberg said. "He is always blabbing away in
the media. If it makes him feel good, then let him keep going. But he
should know that he's going to run into some resistance from me."</TE>
<TE>   MetroStars Prevail</TE>
<TE>   Clint Mathis scored his first goal since the World Cup, connecting
on a pass from Rodrigo Faria in the first minute of injury time to
lead the MetroStars past D.C. United, 1-0, Sunday at East Rutherford,
N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Mathis, whose only other MLS goals this year were against New
England on March 23 and San Jose on April 27, had not scored since
spraining and tearing the meniscus in his right knee on July 6
against Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   Heralded as a potential star before the World Cup, Mathis'
condition was criticized by U.S. Coach Bruce Arena. Mathis scored one
goal during the tournament, giving the Americans a 1-1 tie against
South Korea in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   The MetroStars (10-11-2) stopped a three-game losing streak and
moved within two points of Chicago and Columbus (10-10-4), tied for
first in the Eastern Conference standings.</TE>
<TE>   United (6-12-5) had its best opportunity to score off a header by
Eddie Pope in the 58th minute. But goalkeeper Tim Howard stopped the
shot for his fourth shutout of the season.</TE>

<HD>In a New York State of Mind</HD>
<DH>Tennis: The U.S. Open starts today, but even its familiar
quirks seem different. Sept. 11 changed everything.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The yearly meeting place that is the U.S. Open, which starts today,
is almost like those last couple of weeks before school lets out.
Here, of course, the class consists of incredibly wealthy
individuals, who certainly don't need to borrow lunch money, and
famous divas recognized by a first name.</LD>
<LD>   Plot lines are strikingly similar from year to year. Who's hot,
who's not? How many new alliances have formed? Somebody will complain
about the noise, eventually. The very sameness of the Open's quirks
is reassuring.</LD>
<LD>   Except nothing is the same anymore.</LD>
<TE>   On the approach into Manhattan, where players and officials stay,
are the usual larger-than-life ads promoting the tournament. These
might as well be invisible when coming into New York, especially for
those who have not been here since last year's U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   The tennis world was moving out of Manhattan and the World Trade
Center was in the rearview mirror as many headed to the airports on
Sept. 10, 2001, the day after the men's final between Lleyton Hewitt
and Pete Sampras. Not much more than 36 hours after Hewitt defeated
Sampras came the attacks on the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt and the women's champion, Venus Williams, both were
attempting to return home. Williams' flight was diverted to Florida,
and Hewitt, flying to Sydney, did not learn of the horrific attacks
until he landed in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Almost immediately, the USTA contributed $1 million toward the
World Trade Center relief efforts. Now with the one-year anniversary
approaching, the organization will honor survivors and heroes with
nightly on-court ceremonies, starting with tonight's "A Salute to
Heroes." John McEnroe and Billie Jean King will lead a procession.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a good idea that the USTA is trying to take a
hands-on approach, not pretending like this is something that
happened a year ago, but to tackle it head-on because I think it's
really going to be on people's minds," McEnroe said.</TE>
<TE>   After the ceremony will be first-round matches between top-seeded
Serena Williams, the 1999 champion, and wild-card entrant Corina
Morariu, and No. 6-seeded Andre Agassi, champion here in 1994 and
1999, and Robby Ginepri.</TE>
<TE>   Morariu's return is a celebration in itself. The 24-year-old from
Boca Raton, Fla, is a leukemia survivor. At this time last year she
was undergoing chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   Also in action today is Morariu's former doubles partner, No.
4-seeded Lindsay Davenport, who will face Eva Dyrberg of Denmark.
Davenport has played in four tournaments since returning in July. She
had been out since having knee surgery in January.</TE>
<TE>   Twice, she lost to Venus Williams in straight sets, most recently
in Saturday's final at New Haven, Conn. Being on the other side of
the draw, away from Venus, is a mixed blessing. If form holds,
Davenport would face Serena in the semifinals, and Serena has not
lost in her last 14 Grand Slam matches, winning the French Open in
June and Wimbledon in July.</TE>
<TE>   Serena's acquisition of those titles and the No. 1 spot has come
at the expense of her older sister. But Serena insisted that not much
has changed since her ascension to the top.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I'd be excited every day, all the time. But I'm still
the same person I was three months ago," Williams said at Manhattan
Beach just before her 21-match winning streak ended with a loss to
Chanda Rubin in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   "I still have to buy my own diamonds."</TE>
<TE>   Since losing to Serena at Wimbledon, Venus has won three
tournaments, dropping only one set, to Kim Clijsters of Belgium in
the quarterfinals at Carlsbad. Though No. 2-seeded Venus has a
considerably tougher draw--a potential fourth-round match against
Rubin and possibly No. 3-seeded Jennifer Capriati or No. 10-seeded
Amelie Mauresmo of France in the semifinals--the odds favor another
Williams vs. Williams final.</TE>
<TE>   They have played three of the last four Grand Slam finals,
including last year's U.S. Open in prime time, won by Venus. Venus
can become the first player since Chris Evert to win three
consecutive Opens (Evert won four, from 1975-1978), but Serena also
has history to chase, trying to become the first woman since Steffi
Graf in 1996 to win three consecutive Grand Slam events in the same
year.</TE>
<TE>   American women have won 11 of the last 12 Grand Slam events,
starting with Davenport at Wimbledon in 1999. There isn't that kind
of dominance by one nation or player on the men's side. This year,
six men have reached the first three Grand Slam tournament finals,
and Hewitt is the only one to have been in more than one final in the
last seven majors.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt has not won a tournament since winning Wimbledon; his best
showing was a loss to Carlos Moya of Spain in the final at
Cincinnati. Still, Hewitt is considered the favorite in New York.
Patrick McEnroe, for one, rejects the notion that the 21-year-old
Australian is a transitional champion.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen the guy get better," said McEnroe, the U.S. Davis Cup
captain. "He's clearly mentally tougher than anybody and he learns
very quickly. He figures out opponents, what's working and what's not
working. [Roger] Federer, [Marat] Safin and even [Andy] Roddick, in
my mind, tactically they don't adjust as well in the middle of a
match as Hewitt.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, there are guys that have more firepower than him, but no
one has the mind he has. His hands are very underrated. He hits the
ball very early, picks the ball up in awkward positions really well.
The guy is going to be around."</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt caught a break in the draw when seeded players Thomas
Johansson of Sweden and Guillermo Canas of Argentina withdrew because
of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   This meant Greg Rusedski of Britain became the No. 33-seeded
player and was moved to the opposite side of the draw, away from a
potential second-round match against Hewitt.</TE>
<TE>   Moya is in Hewitt's half, but in the lower quarter with No.
4-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, Agassi and No. 13-seeded
Federer of Switzerland. Hewitt thrives on playing those who hit with
pace.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys that play with a lot of heavy spin, that gives him a lot
of trouble," McEnroe said.</TE>
<TE>   "He has trouble creating his own pace. If you try to open up the
court against him he's dangerous."</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Mociler Centers Himself</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't the political views of young radicals often shift with age,
from the far left to center?</LD>
<LD>   With his boy-next-door features and close-cropped hair, Paul
Mociler could never be confused with a '60s rebel. But Mociler did
begin his UCLA career at left tackle, only to drift to left guard,
and finally, this season, to the middle of the line.</LD>
<LD>   The redshirt sophomore from St. John Bosco High became a center in
the spring when John Ream was sidelined with a knee injury, and he
hasn't looked back (except to snap the ball).</LD>
<TE>   "This is a great opportunity for me," Mociler said. "It's my third
position and a chance to be in the lineup. The toughest part is the
snaps. It's an extra thing to concentrate on."</TE>
<TE>   Mociler entered camp even with Mike McCloskey, but got an edge
when the redshirt freshman missed two days with flu. McCloskey has
done well since returning and it is expected that both players will
get long looks in nonconference games.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul has gotten better each day," quarterback Cory Paus said.
"He's got the size and McCloskey has quickness, so it's a close
battle. I feel comfortable with either of them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Six starters are gone from a defense that was UCLA's best in
years--linebackers Robert Thomas and Ryan Nece, safeties Marques
Anderson and Jason Stephens, and linemen Kenyon Coleman and Ken
Kocher.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it has become evident after a week of camp that the Bruins are
two deep with quality players at nearly every position.</TE>
<TE>   "The cupboard is not bare," Coach Bob Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   Behind starting linemen Rusty Williams, Dave Ball, Rodney Leisle
and Steve Morgan are experienced backups Mat Ball, Sean Phillips, Asi
Faoa and Dave Tautofi. At linebacker, Tim Warfield on the strong side
and Dennis Link in the middle provide quality behind Brandon Chillar
and Marcus Reese. There is less depth on the weak side behind the
surprising Spencer Havner. Cornerback Ricky Manning and free safety
Matt Ware are returning starters in the secondary. Joe Hunter and
Matt Clark are pushing each other at the other cornerback spot and
Ben Emanuel, Jabril Raymo, Kevin Brant and freshmen Jarrad Page and
Eric McNeal give UCLA plenty of options at strong safety.</TE>

<LD>Receiver Greig Carlson could not haul in a scholarship from USC when
he completed his high school career at Palisades High.</LD>
<LD>   But the redshirt freshman's sure hands caught the eye of the
Trojan coaching staff last spring and during training camp, earning
the walk-on a long look as the team's primary punt returner.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, as the Trojans went through their game-day routine and
played a mock game against the service team at the Coliseum, Carlson
handled all of the punts for the first unit without error.</LD>
<TE>   The Trojans lost their most experienced return specialist last
week when cornerback Kevin Arbet underwent season-ending foot
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Receiver Kareem Kelly, who averaged 6.4 yards for eight returns
last season, is listed first on the depth chart, freshman Justin
Wyatt second and Carlson third.</TE>
<TE>   But USC Coach Pete Carroll indicated that Carlson passed Wyatt and
might displace Kelly for the Sept. 2 opener against Auburn.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really a great catcher back there," Carroll said of Carlson.
"I don't want to decide yet. I'm going to wait through the week on
that one. I know Kareem can get back and catch the football and he's
a great threat for us.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still not clear on which is the guy for me yet."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior quarterback Carson Palmer and All-American senior safety
Troy Polamalu were selected as team captains by Trojan players.
Polamalu also was a captain last season.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer said he welcomes the responsibility and is confident that
all seniors on the roster will take a leadership role on and off the
field.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing that coaches should have to do or control on
this team," Palmer said. "With as many leaders as we have, we should
be able to take care of it."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said a special teams captain and service team captain also
will be selected each week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior cornerbacks Ronald Nunn and Marcell Allmond ran sprints in
the end zone and both said they would practice Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Nunn, a transfer from San Francisco City College, was the leading
candidate to replace Arbet at left cornerback until he strained a
hamstring last week. He said he was ready to play Sunday but was held
out as a precaution.</TE>
<TE>   Allmond, making the transition from receiver, was impressive
during the first two days of training camp, but was hospitalized for
five days when stitches in his right knee became infected.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Fred Matua, listed first on the depth chart at right
guard, did not practice because he was attending the funeral of a
family friend....</TE>
<TE>   Senior tailback Justin Fargas remains out because of a hamstring
injury and, with a bye week following the game against Auburn, could
sit out the opener. "We'll have to see how he does on Wednesday,"
Carroll said. "We don't need to force him back right now." ...</TE>
<TE>   Senior linebacker Aaron Graham, recovering from a hip strain, ran
sprints but did not participate in the game situations....</TE>
<TE>   Players begin classes today so the Trojans will not practice. They
will have a workout with no pads Tuesday and begin preparations for
Auburn with a full-scale practice Wednesday.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Teresa Weatherspoon jumped on the press table and danced amid the
falling confetti. Vickie Johnson just smiled after donning her orange
Eastern Conference championship cap.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson scored 19 points on seven-for-10 shooting as the New York
Liberty defeated the Washington Mystics, 64-57, Sunday in Game 3 of
the best-of-three series to advance to their fourth WNBA Finals in
the league's six-year history.</LD>
<LD>   New York will play the defending champion Sparks in Game 1 of the
best-of-three Finals on Thursday at the Garden. The Sparks completed
their sweep of the Utah Starzz in the Western Conference finals on
Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a great feeling to win the Eastern Conference championship,
but it's not over," Johnson said. "We have to go to Los Angeles with
a winning attitude to win a championship and not just settle for
being there."</TE>
<TE>   The Liberty's playoff experience showed in the Game 3. After the
Mystics' Annie Burgess made one of two free throws to cut New York's
lead to 58-55, Johnson sank a baseline jumper to make extend the
Liberty edge to five with 55 seconds left. After the Mystics'
Chamique Holdsclaw missed a three-point attempt, Tari Phillips made
two free throws and Weatherspoon made a layup to pad New York's
margin.</TE>
<TE>   Holdsclaw, who led the league in scoring and rebounding, had 15 of
her 19 points in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad, but I've learned everything happens for a reason," she
said. "We're going to grow and get better. What I love about this
group is we're young and hungry."</TE>
<TE>   New York had a huge advantage at the free-throw line, making 22 of
26. Washington made four of seven.</TE>
