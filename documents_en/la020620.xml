<LD>8pm Opera</LD>
<LD>   "Flip Side 2" is the second edition of an operatic-excerpts show
with a twist: humor as a main, often unexpected, ingredient in
standard-repertory arias and ensembles. OperaWorks' genuine opera
singers--Heather Calvete, Kristina Driskill, Christopher Campbell and
Roberto Perlas Gomez--perform each item as intended, and then ...
costumes catch on the scenery; the singers are getting a divorce from
each other; a substitute tenor has not learned the staging, etc.
Incongruous medleys are mounted; crossover medleys are committed,
Elvis sings "Di Provenza"--you get the picture. Ann Baltz is artistic
director-pianist; and Eli Villanueva is the stage director.</LD>
<LD>   OperaWorks, Unitarian Universalist Church, 12355 Moorpark St.,
Studio City, 8 p.m. $15 to $18. Also, Saturday, 8 p.m. (818)
831-9597.</LD>
<TE>   7:30pm Jazz</TE>
<TE>   The summer smooth-jazz concert series at the Hyatt Newporter takes
on an international flavor with performances by Hiroshima and Willie
&amp; Lobo. Hiroshima's hybrid blend of Japanese instruments with funk,
pop, urban and jazz elements has been pleasing its fans for more than
two decades. Violin and acoustic guitar duo Willie &amp; Lobo open the
show with their Gypsy-flavored musical interplay.</TE>
<TE>   Hiroshima, Willie &amp; Lobo, Hyatt Newporter Outdoor Amphitheater,
1107 Jamboree Road, Newport Beach, 7:30 p.m. $32.50 to $57.50 (213)
480-3232.</TE>
<TE>   all day Movies</TE>
<TE>   "Sunshine State," John Sayles' 13th feature as a director, brings
together many of the trademarks of his earlier work, including a
geographic specificity, social conscience and earnest
characterizations not often found in American films. Edie Falco and
Angela Bassett play two Florida women who find themselves back in
their small hometowns after the big dreams of their youth failed to
pan out. Ralph Waite, James McDaniel, Richard Edson, Jane Alexander,
Timothy Hutton, Mary Steenburgen, Alan King and Miguel Ferrer are
also part of the typically Saylesian, talented ensemble cast.</TE>
<TE>   "Sunshine State," rated PG-13 for brief strong language, a sexual
reference and thematic elements, opens Friday in selected theaters.</TE>
<TE>   all day Movies</TE>
<TE>   In the futuristic thriller "Minority Report," Tom Cruise grapples
with the age-old question of predetermination versus free will. Based
on a story by noted science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, the Steven
Spielberg film is set in 2054 in the Washington, D.C., Pre-Crime
bureau, which rounds up and convicts people before they commit murder
based on downloads from the brains of genetically engineered
"Pre-Cogs." Colin Farrell, Max Von Sydow and Samantha Morton also
star.</TE>
<TE>   "Minority Report," rated PG-13 for violence, brief language, some
sexuality and drug content, opens Friday in general release.</TE>
<TE>   8pm Theater</TE>
<TE>   " 'Master Harold' ... and the boys," the powerful drama by South
African playwright and political activist Athol Fugard, chronicles a

Africa under apartheid, as it explores racism, friendship and the
bonds between fathers and sons.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Master Harold' ... and the boys," International City Theatre at
Center Theater, 300 E. Ocean Blvd., Long Beach, Thursdays to
Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends July 14. $27 to $35. (562)

<TE>   8pm Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   Stepping from cable-comedy stardom back to his original calling,
Chris Isaak is on the concert trail to remind the fans of the suave
retro-pop fantasist who predated the swinging sitcom bachelor of
Showtime's "The Chris Isaak Show." With a new album, "Always Got
Tonight," in stores, the singer-guitarist teams on tour with the
demographically compatible Natalie Merchant.</TE>

<LD>8pm Dance</LD>
<LD>   Twenty years ago, Tobar Mayo, Will Salmon and Debra Samoy founded
Open Gate Theatre, a small-scale local ensemble devoted to
interdisciplinary creation. Although the company has hopscotched
across the Southland in those two decades, its gate still remains
open to new ideas. A program titled "Fragments" celebrates its
performance history with a characteristic emphasis on classic Greek
archetypes. There's an instrumental excerpt from the opera
"Agamemnon," a dance drama titled "Antigone," scenes from a new
comedy based on "The Frogs," and other examples of the company's
links to ancient Attica. A number of longtime collaborators are
rejoining the company for the occasion, along with guest artists and
the three founders.</LD>
<LD>   "Fragments," Open Gate Theatre, the Church in Ocean Park, 235 Hill
St., Santa Monica. 8 p.m. $10. (626) 795-4989.</LD>

<TE>   They say the fields of Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion can
accommodate as many customers as want tickets, but is the outdoor
theater big enough to accommodate the outsized egos and personalities
of Sammy Hagar and David Lee Roth? The pairing of Van Halen's
original frontman and his successor is no less inspired than it is
obvious.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Hagar, David Lee Roth, Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion, 2575
Glen Helen Parkway, Devore, 6 p.m. $20 to $65. (909) 886-8742. Also

<TE>   In Greenwich Village in 1969, they had a mini-riot at the
Stonewall bar. To commemorate it in Los Angeles a year later? They
had a parade. Now it's tradition. Watch for the all-girl motorcycle
gang, the drag cheerleading squad and every other gay-related group
to march down Santa Monica Boulevard on Sunday. The two-day
Christopher Street West 31st Annual Pride Festival &amp; Parade, which
starts Saturday, includes live entertainment, dance areas, and food
and vendor booths. This year's grand marshals will be Doris Roberts
("Everybody Loves Raymond") and Peter Paige ("Queer as Folk"). The

<TE>   9pm Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   A remake of Corey Hart's "Sunglasses at Night" is one of the big
records in the subterranean scene known as electro or electroclash,
and that title might be good advice for those checking out electro
hero Golden Boy. Why? He performs wearing a suit made from a mirrored
disco ball. Golden Boy, who hails from Switzerland, has also brought
a pop attitude to electronic forms in his recordings with French
singer Miss Kittin.</TE>

<TE>   Literary and cinematic influences from Shakespeare to "Star Wars"
abound in a three-day Akira Kurosawa double feature at the New
Beverly Cinema. Kurosawa, one of the uncontested masters of world
cinema, adapted the Bard's "Macbeth" for his 1957 drama "Throne of
Blood," set in the world of the samurai, and starring Toshiro Mifune
and Isuzu Yamada as the murderously ambitious couple. "The Hidden
Fortress," Kurosawa's raucous 1958 adventure about a feisty princess
(Misa Uehara) and a loyal general (Mifune) on a perilous mission is
acknowledged by George Lucas as a primary influence on his 1977 epic,
"Star Wars."</TE>

names are always mentioned: Lionel Hampton, Milt Jackson, Terry
Gibbs, Red Norvo, Gary Burton and Bobby Hutcherson. Los

<TE>   When Josie Walsh's "Avalon" premiered at the Ivar Theatre in
November, The Times called it "a stadium spectacle or Las Vegas
showroom production in miniature." Now this full-evening
multidisciplinary fantasy moves to a bigger stage, with its talented
singers, dancers, actors, aerialists, martial artists and rock
musicians all ready to party in high Arthurian style. A former member
of the Joffrey Ballet, Walsh directed and choreographed the
production as well as dancing in it. Other leading performers include
Ingrid Hoffman, Amy Smart and Demian Boergadine. There's a plot about
the conflict between hedonistic nature-worship and oppressive
Christianity, but it never gets in the way of the high-spirited
action filling the stage--and sometimes spilling into the audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Avalon," James A. Doolittle Theatre, 1615 N. Vine St., Hollywood,

will have commercial releases this summer. In addition to the
higher-profile feature films, the 10-day event offers short-film

<DH>Three exhibitions coming to Los Angeles sketch a stoic and
sensitive portrait of ground zero after the Sept. 11 attack</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To respond to the unthinkable--that was everyone's task after Sept.
11. In New York, impromptu shrines and commemorations sprouted like
mushrooms after rain--notes and photographs dotting walls and fences
near ground zero, candles and memento mori in Union Square. And then
came more concerted efforts, organized exhibitions of art,
photography and writing.</LD>
<LD>   Three of these 9/11 shows are coming to Los Angeles, starting with
the opening today of "Faces of Ground Zero: A Tribute to America's
Heroes" at the Skirball Cultural Center. On June 30, "The September
11 Photo Project" opens at the Armory Northwest annex of the Armory
Center for the Arts, and on July 14, "Reactions" comes to the
Williamson Gallery at Art Center College of Design, both in Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   The Pasadena shows have an open-tent, bring-your-own-art ethos;
the Skirball offering is a more traditional, artist-driven show, but
each began with just one person's private sense of mission--"What can
I do to cope with these events?"</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Faces of Ground Zero" was the brainchild of veteran Life magazine
photographer Joe McNally. Before Sept. 11, he had worked with the
largest Polaroid camera in the world--the size of a one-car garage,
it takes 40-by-80-inch "instant" pictures--for a story on the camera
for National Geographic.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, he had the idea to use the camera--housed in a
studio 20  blocks from the World Trade Center--to create a series of
189 portraits, slightly larger than life-size, of firefighters,
paramedics, survivors, community leaders and others--all members in
one way or another of the ground zero community.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a promise that whatever time of day they came in, we
would shoot them," McNally said by telephone while on an assignment
in Maryland. The studio opened its doors two weeks after Sept. 11 and
stayed open for three weeks. Among those captured on film:
firefighters Billy Ryan and Mike Morrisey, paramedic Juana Lomi,
Cantor Fitzgerald's managing director David Kravette, and then-New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.</TE>
<TE>   The harried Giuliani canceled on McNally and his team three times
before he finally showed up, and in the resulting portrait, he looks
scrunched and uncomfortable in his crisp black suit. "Giuliani was
under tremendous stress," McNally recalled. "I feel the experience
had literally squeezed him."</TE>
<TE>   Each subject was interviewed, and in the exhibition an extract of
their stories appears with their photographs. Some tell of tragic
losses, others of amazing escapes. One of the most extraordinary
survival stories comes from window washer Jan Demczur who, trapped in
a Tower One elevator with five others, managed to pry open the
elevator door with his squeegee. When faced with a plasterboard wall,
he and the others in the elevator used the same instrument to break
through.</TE>
<TE>   "These people had really harrowing days, and the emotions in the
studio were quite high," McNally says. "After the shoot they would
come back and look at their pictures on the floor. Some people went
to pieces, seeing themselves and telling their stories." In January,
87 of McNally's portraits were displayed in Grand Central Terminal,
where an estimated quarter million people saw them. Since then, a
scaled-down show of 58 photographs has traveled to Boston, London and
San Francisco. In L.A., the Skirball was chosen because it had the
right amount of space and adequate security. "We felt that it really
did fit our mission," says museum director Adele Lander Burke. "We
see ourselves as a meeting place, a place to discuss ideas. We wanted
to honor these people."</TE>
<TE>   "The emotional impact is quite high when you see them all
together," McNally said. "It derives from the enormity of the event,
then the stature and dignity of these people."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Feldschuh, amateur photographer and managing director of
an investment company, lives and works in downtown Manhattan. On
Sept. 11 and the days that followed, he took pictures of the
aftermath, including the shrines and ceremonies in Union Square. He
noticed that many others had their cameras in hand as well.</TE>
<TE>   Why not put all those photos together in an exhibition everyone
could see? Feldschuh posted fliers and created a Web site, asking for
submissions--no more than three per photographer, not larger than 11
by 14 inches--and soon his mailbox was flooded.</TE>
<TE>   Feldschuh rustled up donated space on Wooster Street in lower
Manhattan to use as a gallery. He found volunteers to fix it up, and
he paid for miscellaneous expenses out of his own pocket.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 13, the doors opened on "The September 11 Photo Project"
with 200 pieces, all with a photo component and displayed simply, via
binder clips hung on pins stuck in the walls. By the time it closed
on Jan. 10, another 3,500 or so had been added by visitors, creating
a massive collage of smoking buildings, fleeing citizens, exhausted
rescue workers, as well as street memorials and demonstrators wearing
signs proclaiming "Our grief is not a cry for war." Over the course
of three months, according to Feldschuh, 40,000 visitors came to the
gallery space.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he has produced a book based on the exhibition and
hired a small staff to supervise a tour of the show. It has already
made stops in Washington, D.C., and Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to collect and display," said Feldschuh by phone from
New York, "and we don't edit people."</TE>
<TE>   The same "come one, come all" attitude will prevail at Armory
Northwest. The photos will be clipped and hung. "We'll just be taking
them out of the shipping crate and hanging them, one after the
other," says Jay Belloli, the Armory's curator. With 17,000 square
feet available at the Northwest space, there will be room for the
entire collection, which now numbers 5,500, with space left over for
photographs by Angelenos who want to contribute to the project.</TE>
<TE>   "We really want people to have as direct an experience as
possible," says Feldschuh. "As soon as you put it into a frame,
people start seeing it differently. This is not a museum exhibition,
it's a mobile exhibition for people to bear witness. We wanted to
keep the feeling of the shrine; the authenticity lies in the fact
that it's very real, that it hasn't been processed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Exit Art, a multimedia cultural space on lower Broadway  known for
showing edgy work, opened "Reactions" in January. The space's
founders, Papo Colo and Jeanette Ingberman, began gathering work for
it shortly after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The idea was not just commemoration but to explore the way
individuals, artists and non-artists, were changed as a result of the
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt an urgency right away to do something," says Ingberman.
"We were very close to ground zero, and we wanted to hear reactions
from everybody."</TE>
<TE>   The gallery made a general call for submissions via mail and
e-mail: Tell us how this changed your life on an 8 1/2-by-11-inch
sheet of paper.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the most democratic way we could think of having
everyone submit their work," says Bibi Marti, a staffer at Exit Art
and a "Reactions" coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Responses, in words and pictures, came from 3,500 people from 25
countries.</TE>
<TE>   A few well-known artists were among them. William Wegman, famous
for his photographs of Weimaraners, sent in a sketch and wrote about
his memories of the construction of the World Trade Center's twin
towers.</TE>
<TE>   Conceptual artist Carolee Schneemann sent photographic images of
people falling. Christo and Jean-Claude, the wrap-art duo, sent a
piece based on a future project for New York City.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the pieces are sentimental, some are harsh, says Marti.
Some express "ambivalence about why Sept. 11 happened; some people
pointed out our dependence on gas and oil. One person wrote 'curb
your god' [a play on 'curb your dog']. We didn't censor the show at
all." The response, says Ingberman, has been overwhelming. The show
attracted out-of-towners who had never been there before, and viewers
who pored over every image.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't really have national rituals to deal with death," she
adds, as an explanation, "and in a way people want to be part of
something bigger. I don't know if I could top this, to do an art
project that goes beyond the art world."</TE>

<HD>All That Young Jazz</HD>
<DH>L.A. has new players. It has an emerging sound. All it
needs is a scene to bring it all together.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEAN KUIPERS</AU>
<BD>Dean Kuipers is a Los Angeles-based freelance writer.
He last wrote for Calendar Weekend on finding solitude in the city.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deep in the city's cultural memory ring the hot jazz of Jelly Roll
Morton, the R&amp;B drawl memorialized in Walter Mosley's Easy Rawlins
books, and West Coast cool. But the Central Avenue scene died here in
the 1960s. Where's our equivalent to the ongoing $5 Friday-Saturday
midnight jam at New York's Blue Note? With the '90s demise of 5th
Street Dick's and Billy Higgins' World Stage, the youth culture is
gone, boy, long gone ... or maybe just waiting for the club kids to
come back.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   It's a Sunday night at the Jazz Bakery, and Los Angeles' most
secret underground music scene flickers briefly into view. That is,
if you're looking for it. Brilliant 27-year-old pianist Jason Moran
leads his trio through a blazing, genre-defying set, sending shards
of jazz tradition clattering and splashing against the monastic
confines of the room. They look the image of late '60s bebop,
handsome black men in suits, except this music is on a trajectory
toward the now.</LD>
<TE>   Deft practitioners of a hard bop-free jazz collision, Moran,
rising star drummer Nasheet Waits and bassist Tarus Mateen set the
tiny audience on its heels, moving in enormous, spacey leaps from
classical works by Schumann and Ravel to a Moran original called
"Thief Without Loot."</TE>
<TE>   But it isn't until the trio lays into a lovely Bjork song, "Joga,"
that it shows it knows the secret handshake of the young Los Angeles
jazz scene. Moran lights up the interior of the Bjork tune like a CAT
scan, exposing the individual bones of the melody and coloring the
spaces in between with raw improvisation. Hearing it, it's impossible
to think of the song the same way again.</TE>
<TE>   "Earlier you asked me what I was into, how I'd characterize the
local jazz scene for young players. This is it right here," says
Reade Pryor, 19, one of the two college-age fans at Moran's show that
night. Tall and thin, wearing sideburns and a goatee but otherwise
conservatively dressed, Pryor is a drummer studying jazz at USC. He
shows up alone, and no one would ever know he's one of many hundreds
of students here who make up L.A.'s inchoate, almost latent young
jazz crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Pryor represents exactly what's going on with young jazz in L.A.
He rarely frequents top jazz venues like the Bakery, Catalina Bar &amp;
Grill or Spazio; they're too expensive and not devoted to the cutting
edge. He's more excited about what's going on in his school, where
he's hearing aggressive young devotees charged by a new, emerging
sound: a mix of pop, rock, classical, world beat, folk and electronic
music, as well as jazz standards from the '20s to the '02s. He's
being mentored by some of the finest talents among seasoned jazz
professionals, many of whom live and teach here.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, all the elements of a youth jazz culture are moving below
the surface. But Pryor and other young artists hesitate to consider
it a coherent scene. That's because the only thing missing from their
scene ... is the scene itself.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Moran's trio closes with Afrika Bambaataa's 1982
hip-hop crusher "Planet Rock," the definition of what can be jazz is
cracked wide open again. Notably, its version of the song is not one
that modern DJ or hip-hop heads would drool over--it's slappy,
distended, cosmo-funk more in the tradition of Lester Bowie and the
Art Ensemble of Chicago. It's pure, challenging jazz, and not
catering to any trends.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess the best description of what I'm attracted to would be
avant-garde," says Pryor. He notes a recent USC appearance by bassist
Christian McBride, one of a '90s wave of serious young composers,
remarking that McBride presented not only his own work, but also a
Weather Report medley and then the Police's "Walking on the Moon."</TE>
<TE>   "I loved it," Pryor says with a laugh, "but afterward, I was
thinking, 'Wait, what was that? Can I define it? Should I be able to
define it?' This is what's happening right now."</TE>
<TE>   The New Standard, and the Working World</TE>
<TE>   What's happening right now is a period of incubation. Six years
ago, Herbie Hancock put out a jazz album called "New Standard,"
covering hits by folks like Nirvana, Stevie Wonder and Prince. It's
not an earth-shattering album, but several young players mention that
Hancock was onto something. The kids want a new standard. They want,
as Patti Smith once said, "to live in enlightened times."</TE>
<TE>   Radical jazz has found decent-size audiences at various magical
points in history--the hard-bop era of Coltrane and Miles in the late
'50s and early '60s, the free jazz that followed on bop's heels into
the '70s, even the downtown New York "new music" scene of the late
'80s. But this is not one of those times. "The innovative scene is
there, it's just not that visible," says Danny Nielsen, 39, an L.A.
jazz pianist, teacher and film composer. "Here, if it was a Saturday
night and you were looking for it, you'd have to go look for it."</TE>
<TE>   Even then, what you'd find, most likely, is working-man's jazz.
Swinging standards delivered by nimble musicians who can play the
stuff in their sleep. On a typical Friday night at Spazio, for
instance, the veterans on the stand pick deftly from a repertoire of
standards a hundred years deep, throwing in an original composition
once or twice a set. But it's a safe bet to say that every song's
gonna swing pretty cool and regular.</TE>
<TE>   That's the real world facing young talents now, and that's just
fine with Scheila Gonzalez, 30. An award-winning sax player who came
out of the Fullerton College and Cal State Northridge jazz programs
in 1995, Gonzalez has relentlessly pursued her music in an eclectic
array of gigs, ranging from cruise ships to big bands to TV pilots. A
regular member of at least four big bands, she says the key to her
survival is pure networking.</TE>
<TE>   "In my R&amp;B life, I play keyboards with a cover band and love it,"
she says and laughs. Upbeat and armed with moxie, chops and a winning
smile, Gonzalez has the survivor's attitude that is not addressed
directly in most jazz studies programs, but which a great many
teachers try to communicate privately to their students. Is it
capitulation with the status quo? Sure.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not enough to 'shed (that's short for "woodshed,"
jazzspeak for holing up to practice in seclusion). Gonzalez's vision
for her own music is tempered by practical necessity: A musician's
gotta work.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel very blessed to be playing the kind of music that moves
me, which is jazz," says Gonzalez. "You can be the most stellar
musician and 'shed 24 hours a day for years. But unless you get out
there, no one knows who you are."</TE>
<TE>   The jazz world has come to know Gonzalez pretty well. She's made a
name for herself locally with the Bobby Rodriguez Hispanic Musicians
Assn., the sax quartet Four on the Floor, an all-female ensemble
called Maiden Voyage and her own 10-piece ensemble, DekaJaz.</TE>
<TE>   All-woman bands are a niche that's given her lots of work and
moral support. In 2000, she was invited to play with the New
York-based all-woman group Diva, which led to a tour of the
Caribbean, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and the far corners of the
globe. Having played everywhere, including the jazz mecca of New
York, she still feels as if Los Angeles offers her the best
opportunity to make a living as a musician. Still, the longer she
plays, the more she feels the call to innovate. "If I'm going to be
hustling this hard and then booking my own ensemble as well," she
says, "I want them to be playing my music."</TE>
<TE>   No Stars, No Hits, No Scene</TE>
<TE>   It's possible to hear an actual recording of the conflict at the
heart of jazz now. Just listen to "Verve Remixed," the latest release
from venerable jazz giant Verve Records. It's on constant rotation on
KCRW-FM (89.9). One of the pet projects of Ron Goldstein, president
and CEO since 1998 of the Verve Music Group, the album celebrates
what many jazz critics and purists have decried as the ultimate
violation: DJ remixers like Richard Dorfmeister or Tricky stripping
the vocals off classic tracks by Nina Simone, Carmen McRae or Sarah
Vaughan and reworking them into dance mixes. Adding injury to insult,
purists say, Verve then also released an album of the originals,
"Verve Unmixed."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't blame [the critics] for not liking it," says Goldstein.
"We went into some sacred ground with these great singers. But I'm
trying to bring jazz to young people."</TE>
<TE>   With jazz reduced to an estimated 2% share of the total music
market and still shrinking, major labels like Verve, Blue Note and
Columbia Legacy make their loot off back catalogs. With more than
1,500 essential albums from every star imaginable, Goldstein
inherited one of the deepest. He went hunting for new edges, helping
to engineer such phenomena as Diana Krall's 2001 monster album "The
Look of Love." He admits that progress with new straight-ahead jazz
is slow.</TE>
<TE>   "The outlook is not really great for young players," Goldstein
says. "We need a group that you might call a 'wave.' There was
something similar to that about 10 years ago with Joshua Redman,
Nicholas Payton, Christian McBride, Roy Hargrove, Marcus Roberts.
Unfortunately, it didn't last an awful long time."</TE>
<TE>   What's holding back the wave, he says, is the lack of hits. "The
playing is brilliant," Goldstein says. "But no one, no one, seems to
be creating music that is connecting to an audience out there."</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein is sure of one thing: The breakthrough's not going to
come from copying heroes past. The early '90s wave of Redman and Co.
already tried that in their neo-bop stylings. They're charming and
good-looking. They wear the suits. They craft intellectually
challenging music. But, says Goldstein, they're out of step with the
kids.</TE>
<TE>   "Why aren't there younger people coming up who love hip-hop music
and are incorporating some of the current trends into what they're
doing?" he pleads. "I mean, wouldn't Miles Davis have done a hip-hop
jazz record right now?"</TE>
<TE>   The purists may cry foul, but Goldstein's going to give it a try.
His new baby is what he calls a "def jazz" album featuring young
trumpet pioneer Roy Hargrove teaming with the most recognizable
voices in R&amp;B and hip-hop soul, including D'Angelo, Erykah Badu,
?uestlove from Tha Roots, and Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest. The
idea of the still-untitled project is, of course, to get it bumping
out of car stereos and in the live venues where R&amp;B draws massive
crowds.</TE>
<TE>   "The younger audience is not accepting jazz in traditional forms,"
Goldstein says. "We're trying to wake some people up out there."</TE>
<TE>   Too Cool for School?</TE>
<TE>   Hidden away from ears that want hits, a new sound is fusing. The
current club climate has forced it into the schools to form and grow.</TE>
<TE>   "Among the students and faculty at school, there's this kind of
new genre emerging," says Lisa Harriton, 21, a graduate student in
piano at USC. "It's kind of like a fusion of pop and classical and
jazz all in one. After a recent student concert, I said, 'Wow, I feel
like I just went to church!' It's more than just notes, it's
spiritual."</TE>
<TE>   But the veracity of the jazz found within the walls of academia
versus the sound that evolves late at night in clubs is another
debate raging at the heart of jazz.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, jazz studies enrollment has been on the rise at
USC, CalArts, the Cal State universities at Northridge, Los Angeles
and Long Beach, and even at UCLA's relatively new offering--all
programs that didn't even exist in the '70s. The Southland is
saturated with young jazz talent. But are any of those players an
undiscovered Bird, Duke or the leader of a future Weather Report--the
kind of stars that can reclaim a music that is now a cultural
phenomenon and make it a social phenomenon again?</TE>
<TE>   "Something that jazz musicians have always disliked about
classical music is that it has a history of institutional structure,"
says Jordan Wardlaw, 21, a first-year graduate student in saxophone
and woodwinds at USC. "That has a real home in Europe. In America, if
jazz is really going to be this powerful market trend, it has to be
free, it can't be institutionalized."</TE>
<TE>   "The schools are thriving. All the good players are ending up
there," says Danny Nielsen. "But the kids that are seeking serious
jazz as a career are using this as a refuge. This is where you go to
find the jazz community. It's become academic."</TE>
<TE>   True enough, since the first jazz programs at Boston's Berklee
School of Music and North Texas State in Denton were born in the
1970s, jazz has become a viable academic pursuit. There are practical
incentives. It's tough for budding composers to get a quartet
together from the far-flung corners of the city. In school, however,
they just bring the charts to class and have a whole orchestra at
their disposal. The schools are the closest thing we have to a jazz
neighborhood like Greenwich Village or the French Quarter, but the
door is closed to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't walk into a Bach concerto and just sit in," says
Nielsen. "But jazz is made that way. Guys used to walk into 5th
Street Dick's and play. The person that's going to make the next big
change is rarer now that the clubs aren't happening. A Bird, Mingus,
Miles Davis is not emerging now, because they don't have that
community to grow up with in public."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is migration from schools to clubs. John Clayton,
co-leader of the popular Clayton-Hamilton Orchestra, says that he
hears about new talent the old-fashioned way. "Word of mouth," he
says. "It travels like wildfire. When a student or a young player is
on fire, inspired and in love with the music, everybody in the jazz
community hears about it."</TE>
<TE>   Jazz Is Dead! Long Live Jazz!</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the obstacles and second-guessing, more and more young
people are playing jazz in L.A. They're not moving away to New York
or Chicago or Boston, thinking it's better. They're counting on the
scene here to gel. Or not.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't hear people at school saying, 'Oh, I gotta get out of
here and go to Chicago or to New York, where there's more of a live
jazz scene.' They're going to stick it out," says Pete De Siena, 23,
a graduate student in trumpet at USC. "I have a whole bunch of music
school friends in New York, and I get weekly reports back from them,
saying, 'Oh, we're not doing anything,' or 'I just picked up a job at
Barnes &amp; Noble.' "</TE>
<TE>   To that end, he's getting a degree to fall back on. De Siena came
here from the New York area and was initially shocked at how
difficult it was to find the "scene" in Southern California. "It's
growing on me," he says. To De Siena, L.A. is still the place to work
as a studio musician, get live and tour gigs, write jingles and
scores for film and television, and to teach. And, evidently, to play
live jazz.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest problem with the development of young voices in L.A.
is venue," Clayton says. "They need a garage."</TE>
<TE>   A musician grabbing a drink between late sets at Spazio agrees.
"What we need is a good hang," the musician says. "A bar. A dive
where hot players go just because they know people are listening.
Nobody's listening here, they're too busy eating dinner."</TE>
<TE>   One interesting recent development is the return of late-night
jazz at Rocco down on Santa Monica Boulevard's theater row. Once
perched up on Bel-Air's Beverly Glen and catering to the high-end
supper crowd, the club run by Rocco Samozzi, himself only 30, has
gone more musically and culturally adventurous in the form of a boho
cafe theater. There's no liquor license yet, but the cover's usually
only $10 for some of the most way-out jazz in the city. Plus, sets
don't usually start until 10:30 p.m. and continue into the wee hours.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the music that's happening here is a synthesis of
classical music and traditional jazz and rock 'n' roll and world
music and avant-garde," says Rocco's music coordinator, 30-year-old
Matt Piper. "There are a lot of people making individual statements
here; they're not trying to conform to any expectation or any
preestablished school."</TE>
<TE>   Reopened nearly a year, Rocco has evolved into the kind of free
music commune that the Knitting Factory never became on this coast, a
redoubt for forward-thinking music like that of CalArts graduate
James Carney's trio or the L.A. Jazz Quartet. One recent night, while
the Rob Blakeslee Quartet grappled with the febrile lines of hugely
expansive structures approaching free jazz, Piper skittered from the
couches down front to the espresso machine in a T-shirt commemorating
Japanese avant-noise ensemble Acid Mothers Temple. From Eastern Bloc
avant-garde to blues-skronk, the idea is new music, and that idea is
something that's been sorely lacking in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "Out of this kind of adversity is born strength," Clayton says.
"The youth will find a place to bring us this music. Once the music
is really that urgent, they will find a place to play it."</TE>

<DH>An Irvine water park's annual Olympics makes a family
outing a fitness event too</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE J. NELSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At Wild Rivers Waterpark in Irvine, employees celebrate summer's end
at a "lifeguard Olympics" that transforms the park into an obstacle
course that weaves through wave pools, a lazy river and water slides.
Saturday, the Olympic tradition will be turned on its head as
civilians are invited to hurl themselves through the 2-mile course.</LD>
<LD>   "It kind of marks the beginning of summer for us," says Jon
Colletti, a Wild Rivers spokesman. "We thought we'd let the public
see what it's like to be a lifeguard for a day. We wanted it to be
competitive but also a fun event."</LD>
<LD>   At the third-annual Wild Rivers Waterpark 5K &amp; Waterpark
Challenge, family members of all ages can run, swim and slide their
way through three events. The suggested age minimum for the Waterpark
Challenge is 11, but children as young as 9 usually can handle the
slides, Colletti says. The all-ages 5K Run/Walk follows a path that
bigger mammals once trod--the road through what used to be Lion
Country Safari. The 10-and-under set can run in the Children's
Quarter-Mile Mini Event, where every participant earns a medal for
running from the inside to the outside of the water park.</LD>
<TE>   By spinning a morning at the park as a fitness event, Wild Rivers
is on to something, experts say. In this age of sedentary
entertainment, parents should encourage any physical activity and
seek to broaden the concept of what constitutes a workout.
(Spokespeople for Hurricane Harbor in Valencia and Raging Waters in
San Dimas say their parks do not stage similar events.)</TE>
<TE>   "Research does show that if parents are physically active, the
more likely their children will be active," says Julie Walton a
professor of health and physical education at Calvin College in Grand
Rapids, Mich. "One thing good about encouraging parents and children
to do things together, the kids will be more active as they become
adults."</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Jamieson, chair of the department of recreation and park
administration at Indiana University in Bloomington, Ind., says
there's also a positive lesson in viewing a water park as a sports
destination.</TE>
<TE>   "A study done by the University of Michigan 10 years ago showed
that kids quit athletic activities because they aren't fun. They feel
that sports have become too serious," Jamieson says. "So, from a
fitness standpoint, it's important to teach them that no matter where
you are, there are lots of ways to engage in being fit."</TE>
<TE>   But make sure Mom comes along.</TE>
<TE>   "The mother's level of activity seriously affects the child's. So
in that respect, an event like that is a great thing," says Walton,
who is known for staging amusing fitness events on Calvin's campus.
(An indoor track race incorporated "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire"-style questions in each lap, while a "Mt. Everest climb"
ascended stairs.)</TE>
<TE>   At Wild Rivers, the games begin with the Waterpark Challenge.
Competitors swim across two wave pools before running to, then
swimming around the Safari River Expedition, a quarter-mile loop
usually filled with people floating on inner tubes. After that, they
attack five water slides: the Wahtubee, a straight speed slide;
Serengeti Surf Hill, a head-first slide; Sweitzer Falls, which dumps
sliders into a pool; the Cobras, body slides that wind down a
mountain; and Congo River Rapids, a whitewater-style ride. Known in
the employee Olympics as the "iron man," the Waterpark Challenge
takes about 15 minutes--and can be competitive. Last year's winner
was a triathlete.</TE>
<TE>   There are 13 age divisions for the Waterpark Challenge and the 5K
race, ranging from under 12 to over 80. The top three male and female
winners of the challenge win cash: $500 for first, $250 for second,
$100 for third. Overall winners of the 5K are awarded prizes and gift
certificates, while age-division winners of both races are given
medals.</TE>
<TE>   All participants will receive a ticket, valid that day only, to
Wild Rivers. General admission is usually $25, compared with the
$13-$17 race entry fee. Proceeds benefit the Make-a-Wish Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   But any summer day spent racing around the water park shouldn't be
discounted in the exercise equation. "That's a day of physical
activity that's quite worthwhile," Walton says. "Now, of course, if
you could get the water parks to stop selling hot dogs and French
fries."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>* The cabaret-style singer, guitarist and violinist has a new record
called "Snakebite."</LD>
<LD>   Best Spots on Tour: I guess the Fold is my favorite club to play,
which is either at the Derby or the Silverlake Lounge. There are a
lot of problems with playing at the Silverlake Lounge--the stage is
very low, and the sound isn't that great--but the energy is always
really good and so that makes it fun. Sadly, I don't think there are
really great clubs to play in L.A. But in Chicago, there's the
Hideout Inn. It sort of has a cabin feel with wood-paneled walls, and
they have a great sound system and are very friendly. The husband of
the owner introduces each band and the audience is very receptive. I
also love the True Love Cafe in Sacramento, which is owned by Kevin
Seconds, of the punk band 7 Seconds. It's also very cozy and
unpretentious. My other favorite would be the El Matador in New
Orleans, which is like a bizarre, creepy, wonderful New Orleans bar.
It's on the edge of the quarter, so it's not touristy, and it's very
old. It just feels really spooky.</LD>
<TE>   The James Dean of Chinatown: I like Quon Bros. Grand Star
Restaurant in Chinatown. They have live jazz karaoke on Fridays and
Saturdays, and I consider Mr. Quon to be the James Dean of Chinatown.
He's a very suave, handsome man, and he will often perform himself.
They have a really good jazz trio with a woman pianist, upright
bassist and drums, and you can get up and sing with them. I either
sing "Pennies From Heaven" or "All of Me." Some of the waitresses
will get up and sing too. And tropical drinks are always fun. The
crowd is varied from the local Chinese people in Chinatown and a lot
of the Art Center kids, though I prefer it when it's a little
emptier.</TE>
<TE>   A Regular: I was a waitress, so I always feel it's really
embarrassing to be a regular. When I was a waitress, I always hated
them. But I am a regular at the Mustard Seed Cafe in Los Feliz. It's
very homey and neigborhoody, not hip, and they have really good
coffee. I like to eat an English muffin there, and sometimes I will
splurge and get myself an omelet with mushrooms and cheese, but all
of their food is really good.</TE>
<TE>   Salsa and Chips: La Fe is a great Mexican place in Echo Park on
Sunset. It's a good place to practice my Spanish and eat really good,
authentic, very cheap Mexican food. There's basically no decor; it's
just the real deal. One thing about living on the Eastside of town is
that a lot of the communities don't mix. There's the Armenian
hangouts and the artsy places and the Latin places, but this
restaurant gets a really good mix.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody Walks in L.A.: I love my neighborhood, Los Feliz. It's an
old neighborhood with a lot of buildings from the '20s and '30s. I
can walk to the movies and to restaurants and up to Griffith Park. I
walk everywhere. I think it's one of the few places in L.A. where you
can really walk to everything you need. Though it's kind of
disturbing how it has become so gentrified. It's getting really
expensive because of that. But I'm hoping I can hold on and stay in
my neighborhood, because I love it.</TE>

and back</DH>

<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Wild Things" at the Ivar Theatre is really more a dance piece than
the world-premiere musical it is billed as. The story concerns Max
(Brian Kimmet), a young film-production assistant who escapes from
his boring job in flights of music-stimulated fancy.</LD>
<LD>   Falling asleep at work, Max imagines himself in the magical land
of the Wild Things--a hallucinatory version of Hollywood populated
with hookers, drag queens and street people of the most extravagant
order. There, Max defeats the Homeless King (Clyde Ince) and assumes
his throne.</LD>
<LD>   But Max soon tires of his newly acquired splendor, bids farewell
to his fawning followers and returns to the real world.</LD>
<TE>   Waking from his offbeat reverie, Max quits his job and sallies
forth to do "something creative" with his life.</TE>
<TE>   A flimsy premise, to be sure (give an uncredited nod to Maurice
Sendak), but it serves the purpose, which is simply to entertain.
There's little grit or seaminess in this mix. Even the hookers and
homeless people are a surprisingly wholesome lot who would pass
muster on a Saturday-morning kids' show.</TE>
<TE>   Max's foray into a gay bar is not presented as an indication of
his sexual ambivalence but as a pretext for lively disco dancing by
guys in modified leather attire.</TE>
<TE>   Creator Lorenzo Medrano, who co-wrote the piece with Eric James,
also serves as director and choreographer, expertly guiding his cast
of 30-plus through their paces. Under the musical direction of Lyon
Rowland, driving live music keeps the action percolating. Don Hill's
original music is noteworthy, as is Stephen Davis' lighting design.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Anderson's whimsical costumes and Keith Mitchell's set
are essential components of the eye-catching whole.</TE>
<TE>   As for the performers, they strut, leap, cascade up the aisles and
spiral down from the balconies in this slight but pleasing diversion,
a short shot of highly distilled glitz guaranteed to lift your
spirits.</TE>
<TE>   "Wild Things," Ivar Theatre, 1605 Ivar St., Hollywood.
Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 and 7 p.m. Ends June 30.
$15-$30. (323) 655-8587. Running time: 1 hour.</TE>

<LD>   King Lear--Experimental productions can shake us loose from our
connoisseurship, demanding that we experience a classic as an
unpredictable and even dangerous creation, and this is exactly the
value of director Travis Preston's audacious and intermittently
revelatory modern-dress "King Lear" for the newly formed professional
Center for New Theater at CalArts. "King Lear" is never easy, but
with its all-female cast, large-scale video projections and
insistence that the audience follow the action from room to room,
this version delivers one artful surprise after another. Stylistic
inconsistencies take their toll, however, and Preston's interest in
some major characters, but not others, wrecks the staging's final
hour. Throughout this crucial arc of the play, Preston delivers not
experimental or concept-driven Shakespeare or minimalist Shakespeare,
but a bewildering botch, complete with unfortunate cuts, large and
small, in the adaptation by Royston Coppenger. So brush up on your
Shakespeare if you plan to go; Preston's finale needs all the
narrative clarity his audience can bring to it. Lewis Segal</LD>

<LD>   "No!," They Might Be Giants. Idlewild Recordings/Rounder Records.
CD: $18. Ages 5 to 12 (and adult TMBG fans). www.giantkid.net
/www.theymightbegiants.com</LD>
<LD>   Children's albums don't come any better--or more wonderfully
strange--than "No!," a first-time family recording by alternative pop
duo They Might Be Giants, otherwise known as John Flansburgh and John
Linnell.</LD>
<TE>   A Grammy winner for "Boss of Me" (the theme song for the TV show
"Malcolm in the Middle") and still one of rock music's most
off-the-wall creative forces, TMBG is accessible to adults and
children here. Its playful and even unexpectedly sweet songs are
spiked with just a pinch of the duo's signature darkness.</TE>
<TE>   In the reality-bending songs "I Am Not Your Broom," "I Am a
Grocery Bag" and "Sleepwalkers," a broom rebels ("No John I will not
sweep for you/for I am not your broom"); a lugubrious grocery bag
declares itself ("Milk and biscuits and cocktail sauce: I am a
grocery bag"); and sleeping children, who must not be disturbed,
wander alarmingly "all across the country."</TE>
<TE>   With the talents of the ace Band of Dans (drummer Dan Hickey,
bassist and singer Danny Weinkauf and guitarist Dan Miller) and the
"No" Friends (singers Robin "Goldie" Goldwasser and Nicholas Hill,
cellist Garo Yellin, violinist Krystof Witek, trombonist Dan Levine
and trumpeter Jim O'Connor), Flansburgh and Linnell fit the songs to
various musical styles, from eerie, mechanical techno-pop ("Robots on
Parade") to a mellow 1960s innocence ("Where Do They Make
Balloons?").</TE>
<TE>   Some songs repeat words or syllables, like the weirdly compelling
"Wake Up Call," made up entirely of combinations of "bo," "ba" and
"baw." "Violin," a strange, stream-of-consciousness track, plays with
repetitions of "violin-lin-lin," "hippo," "mop" and "speck of dust,"
before becoming a surrealistic lesson in fractions: "one quarter of
George Washington's head," "half of George Washington's head.... "</TE>
<TE>   There are rubber guitars, buttons on cars, bicycle hats and dogs
"two miles wide" on "Fibber Island." In "Four of Two," a man waits an
eternity for a 2 p.m. rendezvous with his lady love, never catching
on that the clock has stopped. And in "The House at the Top of the
Tree," the listener becomes part of a round-and-round tale about an
angry mouse and a potato chip-delivering dog.</TE>
<TE>   Every song is a wacky discovery, and the kid-tickling humor
doesn't stop. The CD's enhanced computer play features animated
visuals that offer loads of interactive fun on 13 of the 17 tracks.</TE>

<HD>A Bumpy but Earnest Ride in This Return to 'The Twilight
Zone'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID C. NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Given that the late Rod Serling's teleplays for "The Twilight Zone"
are based in parabolic concerns broader than the Cold War-era issues
they originally addressed, it seems logical they might prove relevant
to the terror-ridden present, even while standing on their
considerable literary merits. This reasoning propels the stage
adaptation of two vintage episodes now playing the El Portal Circle
Theatre in a joint presentation by 4Letter Entertainment and the
Company Rep.</LD>
<LD>   Submitted for your consideration: "The Odyssey of Flight 33" and
"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street," each a celebrated example of
Serling's contributions to his classic science-fiction anthology
series. Serling's unerringly ironic, humanistic worldview retains its
prescient vitality, transcending era and cultural context. This
quality of impudent imagination surely accounts for the series'
enduring power in syndication, even beyond the twists of plot or
various fantastic elements. Such inherent trenchancy of theme
dominates "Flight 33," one of Serling's several airplane exercises,
here concerning a commercial airline crew struggling to maintain
rational response to an unimaginable mid-flight occurrence. And
"Maple Street," a contender for Serling's finest work, feels acutely
topical in its examination of personality profiling borne of
community paranoia.</LD>
<TE>   However, while the aptness of Serling's dimension of the mind is
intact, the dimensions of sight and sound are more dubious, though
the earnest intent of everyone involved is obvious. The execution and
concept present a doggedly makeshift journey, whose boundaries seem
less those of imagination than of repertory exigencies and the
midnight collegiate circuit. The high-ceilinged venue is one
liability, its open thrust configuration not exactly conducive to
emotional intimacy or claustrophobic intensity. Furthermore, the show
plays on the miniature golf course setting for Company Rep's
"Criminal Minds," and the giant brontosaurus alone distracts
throughout.</TE>
<TE>   Such environmental challenges could be turned into assets by
imaginative staging. But director Walter Koenig is operating from
"The Outer Limits," the erratic tempo and constantly shifting
blockage of sight lines especially irritating. Jeremy L. Rolla's
lighting, Paca Thomas' sound and Zale Morris' costumes are
resourceful, though they can't compensate. Nor can the ensemble,
going through hieratic paces with wan efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   While Dwayne Rider admirably avoids mimicking Serling, his
narrator is so tenuously maneuvered as to blur his function. Similar
hazards plague Ricco Ross' pilot, Mark Costello's neighborhood
vigilante, and so on through the cast list.</TE>
<TE>   In fairness, the most entitled approach couldn't sustain the
joviality of emcee Ken Pringle, whose audience participation tactics
are a severe miscalculation, jettisoning the last vestiges of proper
mood. Cultists may disregard these reservations, even as a more
suitably black-box reading of, say, "The Obsolete Man" or "Five
Characters in Search of an Exit" seems advisable for future
excursions.</TE>

<HD>An Explosion of Lawlessness</HD>
<DH>Cinematheque series focuses on a violent but little-known
(in the U.S.) Japanese film genre</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK OLSEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When most people think of Japanese cinema, their minds usually turn
to the stately storytelling of Akira Kurosawa or Yasujiro Ozu. Aside
from the craft and mastery of their filmmaking, these directors in
many ways helped to create a broader understanding of Japanese
culture among Western audiences.</LD>
<LD>   Starting Friday, the American Cinematheque's fourth Japanese
Outlaw Masters series brings a different side of the nation's
filmmaking to the public.</LD>
<LD>   Spotlighting such lesser-known directors as Seijun Suzuki, Takeshi
Miike and Kinji Fukasaku, these films are full of mad yakuza
gangsters, eruptions of graphic violence, the occasional
cross-dresser and cinematic technique that is jazzy and jagged to the
point of near insanity. Not for the faint of heart, these often
challenging films are also ultimately quite rewarding, both for their
own wild aesthetics and for the way they engender a fuller sense of
the Japanese film industry.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a tradition of genre filmmaking in Japan from the 1950s
to today that really flourished from 1955 to 1975," says Cinematheque
programmer Chris D. "The Japanese films commonly known in America
represent a small fraction of the overall output. Because of the
studio system in place there, the level of skill and craftsmanship on
all their films is incredible."</TE>
<TE>   Largely lacking the sleek narrative efficiencies of even the most
fringe American filmmaking, the work presented in the Japanese series
strives for something else. Often reaching a point at which technique
and emotion combine to create incredibly powerful and vivid imagery,
these films are like a blast of wasabi: bracing and strange, yet
leaving you wanting more.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the reigning godfather of the Japanese outlaw "movement"
is Suzuki, whose latest film, the aptly titled "Pistol Opera," opens
the series in its L.A. premiere. Just this side of 80, Suzuki has
made 40-plus films in a career that dates back to 1956. Beginning as
a contract director at the Nikkastu studio, he made some 25 films
between his debut and 1963's "Youth of the Beast," generally
considered his breakthrough work.</TE>
<TE>   Though he was making genre pictures on small budgets and tight
schedules, Suzuki's interests began to move in other directions.
Described by critic David Chute as a "free jazz gangster film,"
1966's "Tokyo Drifter" submerged narrative to the point of
abstraction, as the imagery of Suzuki's pictures became his primary
focus. After 1967's "Branded to Kill," Nikkastu fired Suzuki,
ostensibly for making incoherent pictures. Since he left the studio
system to work as an independent filmmaker, Suzuki's output has
slowed, and he has made only a handful of films since the late 1970s.
His enormous body of work was virtually unscreened in America until
the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   A sort-of sequel to "Branded to Kill," Suzuki' s latest film finds
him returning to the yakuza revenge thriller as a beautiful assassin
stalks her prey, but the action is rendered in such a way as to make
it nearly incomprehensible as a conventional narrative. Instead,
Suzuki creates a wondrous cascade of images, each sequence seemingly
more fantastic than the last. Perhaps the only close relation is the
dream-logic of a film such as David Lynch's "Mulholland Drive."</TE>
<TE>   "If you walk in expecting to see a straight-up action film, you're
going to be disappointed," warns Chris D. "But if you expect to see a
deconstructed film disguised as a commentary on genre, with a style
that's almost painterly, a series of filmed landscapes, you'll be
amazed."</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the outlaw spectrum is Miike, considered the
reigning enfant terrible of Japanese cinema. Working at a prodigious
pace, he routinely makes three or four films a year, many of them for
the Japanese home video market.</TE>
<TE>   The extreme violence and operatic emotions of his films polarize a
love-him-or-hate-him attitude in most filmgoers. Miike, 42, is among
a handful of filmmakers who work in the uncompromising manner blazed
by Suzuki.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say the biggest thing they have in common is a dark, almost
macabre sense of humor," says Chris D., who has worked for more than
10 years on a forthcoming encyclopedia of Japanese yakuza films.
"Even amid the mayhem of Miike or narrative convulsions of Suzuki, I
always find myself laughing. Say what you will about it, but I find
'Ichi the Killer' very funny."</TE>
<TE>   "Ichi the Killer," which receives its Los Angeles debut on
Saturday, is an adaptation of a banned manga comic and is Miike's
most successful film to date in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   People familiar with his work through the slow-burn creepiness of
"Audition," which received a theatrical release here late last year,
will be in for a shock. "Ichi" can be seen as a compilation of
gross-out one-upmanship in which bodies are mangled and mutilated in
increasingly outlandish ways. But that would overlook the strange,
understated poetry of the film's climactic showdown, in which the
emotionally distraught hit man of the title meets the obsessive mob
boss who is, in fact, its main character.</TE>
<TE>   It is that off-balance confusion, with the viewer unsure whether
to grin or grimace, that is Miike's stock in trade. As if to prove
the point, the series also includes the L.A. premiere of another of
his recent films, "The Happiness of the Katakuris." A curious blend
of Claymation and live action, the film follows a "Swiss Family
Robinson"-style mountain clan fending off aliens with karaoke.</TE>
<TE>   Also featured in the series will be the U.S. premiere of
Fukasaku's 1969 film "Black Rose Mansion," featuring Akihiro
Maruyama, the drag performer from his cult classic "Black Lizard."</TE>
<TE>   Also screening will be "Japanese Devils," the first documentary to
be included in a Japanese Outlaw Masters program. Director Minoru
Matsui is scheduled to appear with his film, which deals with Japan's
responsibility for and repressed guilt over atrocities committed
during the Pacific campaigns of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Cinematheque will feature another series of Japanese films in the
fall, Chris D. says, spotlighting two of the nation's most enduring
stars, Raizo Ichikawa and Shintaro Katsu. Ichikawa, who died in 1969,
is considered by many to be Japan's James Dean for his lasting hold
on the nation's youth, and Katsu is known for a series of films in
which he portrayed a blind swordsman. The fall series will feature
more traditional films, many of them samurai pictures.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The eighth annual Los Angeles Film Festival opens tonight at the
ArcLight Cinerama Dome with a gala presentation of Nicole
Holofcener's "Lovely &amp; Amazing," starring Brenda Blethyn, Catherine
Keener, Emily Mortimer and Raven Goodwin in a story of a mother and
her three daughters.</LD>
<LD>   Sponsored by the Independent Feature Project/West, the festival
runs through June 29 at various venues.</LD>
<LD>   Among the opening weekend attractions is the clever, amusing and
wistful "Showboy" (Sunset 5, Saturday at 7 p.m.; the Directors Guild,
Monday at 5:30 p.m.), in which BBC documentarian Lindy Heymann zeros
in on Christian Taylor, a young Englishman trying to make it in
Hollywood. No sooner has Heymann started the camera rolling than
Taylor is fired from his job as a writer for "Six Feet Under."</LD>
<TE>   Too proud to let Heymann know the truth, Taylor gets her to follow
him to Las Vegas, where ostensibly he's researching a script but
actually is pursuing his dream of becoming a member of a dance
chorus. Taylor and Heymann co-directed, and their verisimilitude is
as flawless as it is alternately funny and touching.</TE>
<TE>   Slim, curly-haired and handsome, Taylor has sensational charisma
even if he's not as buff as the professional dancers whose ranks he
craves to join. Included are knockout cameos by Alan Ball, Whoopi
Goldberg and Siegfried &amp; Roy.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Allen Harris' 1996 documentary "Vintage: Families of
Values," a vibrant account of the experiences of three sets of gay
African American siblings, was beautiful, heartfelt and tonic in its
effect, a description that also fits his newest work, "E Minha
Cara/That's My Face" (Sunset 5, Saturday at 4:45 p.m.; the DGA, June
28 at 5 p.m.)</TE>
<TE>   It documents Harris' cultural identity and spiritual searches in
the form of a shimmering collage of images of his New York childhood
and his experiences in Tanzania with his mother and brother,
culminating in Salvador de Bahia, Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   Harris has drawn from home movies, family photographs, and even
his grandfather's proud recording of TV images of black leaders and
celebrities in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   On his odyssey, Harris not surprisingly encounters contradictions
and complexities, but he lovingly embraces them all in his desire to
connect with an African cultural and religious heritage.</TE>
<TE>   Sure to rank among the festival's strongest offerings, Christopher
Scott Cherot's "G" (DGA, Wednesday at 9:45 p.m.; the Sunset 5, June
27 at 5 p.m.) is a boldly imaginative and strikingly successful
reworking of F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby," starring
Richard T. Jones as a suave, powerful rap mogul who has built an
ultramodern estate in the Hamptons as a display of his success. But
he longs for his lost love from college days, a beautiful woman
(Chenoa Maxwell), who not believing he would amount to anything,
ditched him for a financier (Blair Underwood).</TE>
<TE>   Now that the mogul has become a nearby neighbor, she realizes her
mistake. Class, money, unrequited passion, the treacherousness of the
American Dream and fate--all that concerned Fitzgerald emerges here
in this assured, sophisticated and stylish film that plays rap
numbers against Bill Conti's timelessly elegant score.</TE>
<TE>   For his irresistible documentary "Spellbound" (Sunset 5, Monday at
7:30 p.m.; DGA, Wednesday at 5 p.m.), filmmaker Jeff Blitz followed
eight kids in their early teens from widely differing backgrounds and
locales through their regional competitions all the way to
Washington, D.C., for the National Spelling Bee.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to want all eight to win, especially youngsters such as
Angela, daughter of a Mexican cowboy who entered the country
illegally and who doesn't speak English after 20 years in the U.S.
It's heartwarming to see so many first-generation U.S. children
participating in so American a tradition and discovering a sense of
community with other kids as bright and focused as they are. (866)
FilmFest.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Warhol on Screen festival continues Friday at 7 p.m. at the
Pacific Design Center with "Outer and Inner Space" (1965). Clearly,
Warhol perceived a discrepancy between the physical beauty of his
doomed superstar Edie Sedgwick and her inner conflict when he decided
to videotape her talking, then film her facing her previously taped
image, which we see on a TV set on a table behind her.</TE>
<TE>   When this 66-minute segment is presented in split screen, reducing
the running time by half, with the latter part projected on the left
side of the screen, we get an even more intensified sense of
Sedgwick's fragmented personality as she is confronted with her own
image and words.</TE>
<TE>   What a radiant natural screen presence was Sedgwick, whose perfect
diction reveals her aristocratic ancestry, and whose dazzling smile
and charming personality recall the young Elizabeth Taylor. And what
a Hollywood screen test Warhol's footage could have been. Indeed, the
shimmering image of Sedgwick on the video screen recalls that famous
clip of the younger Gloria Swanson from "Queen Kelly" quoted in
"Sunset Boulevard."</TE>
<TE>   Unintentionally or not, "Outer and Inner Space," which is
screening as part of the Museum of Contemporary Art's "Andy Warhol
Retrospective," has a muddied soundtrack, but in a way that is sadly
appropriate. As Sedgwick prattles on, enough of her talk can be heard
to suggest that she was trying to make sense of her life. But neither
she nor others listened to her closely enough to save her from the
drugs that left her personality vacant but her beauty intact, and
which finally claimed her life in 1971 at age 28.</TE>
<TE>   Much has been written about the implications for the possibilities
of mixed media posed by "Outer and Inner Space," but surely it is
more important as a portrait of a beautiful woman with the touching
vulnerability of a Marilyn Monroe.</TE>
<TE>   Also screening Friday is the 66-minute "The Life of Juanita
Castro" (1965), in which the family of Fidel Castro, played by
Factory regulars, poses for a formal group portrait while playwright
Ronald Tavel, who would become a frequent Warhol collaborator, gives
the various characters lines to recite.</TE>
<TE>   The central figure is Fidel's sister Juanita, played by pioneer
underground filmmaker Marie Menken, who is not happy with her
brother's Communist dictates. Fidel, his brother Raul and Che Guevara
are all played by women, none of whom is in drag. The effect is
amusingly subversive even though the film seems interminable.</TE>
<TE>   There's more of Edie Segwick in Wednesday's 7 p.m. screening. In
the 33-minute "Restaurant" (1965), Sedgwick seems lively and alert in
a way nearly unique in a Warhol film as she participates in a dinner
party with several friends at her favorite restaurant, L'Avventura.
In the 66-minute "Space" (1965), a vivacious Sedgwick easily
dominates a Factory scene in which Tavel attempts to give lines to
Factoryites for eight distinct playlets, a most likely deliberate
exercise in futility that quickly lapses into a food-throwing
free-for-all. (213) 621-1745.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Revenge of the Japanese Outlaw Masters," the American
Cinematheque's fourth annual survey of Japan's goriest, edgiest
filmmakers, runs Friday through Wednesday at the Egyptian. (See
story, page 34.) (323) 466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Note: Josef von Sternberg's classic groundbreaking gangster
picture "Underworld," which won Ben Hecht the first Oscar for best
original story, stars Clive Brook, Evelyn Brent, George Bancroft and
Larry Semon. It screens at the Silent Movie Theatre Friday and
Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 1 and 4 p.m. (323) 655-2520.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the U.S. played Mexico in the World Cup last Sunday, Lucky
Baldwin's was packed, quite literally, to the rafters.</LD>
<LD>   In the loft above the kitchen, where one TV was tuned to the
match, heads of standing patrons nearly scraped the ceiling. The
overflow crowd was perched on the stairs, trying to find a view
between beer-sipping heads. The narrow room that holds the bar was so
full of sweaty bodies that you'd have thought the people in there
were playing soccer, not just watching it on TV.</LD>
<LD>   Down the street at Hooters, which had been packed the week before
for the NBA Finals, they were putting the chairs up on the tables for
the night. A bad rock band was screaming in Moose McGillicuddy's.
World Cup fever had made Lucky Baldwin's the most happening spot for
blocks in Old Town Pasadena.</LD>
<TE>   Although there are several places in and around L.A. to watch
World Cup soccer with like-minded fans, this little Irish pub may be
one of the few where you can watch all of the games. Live.</TE>
<TE>   That's no small thing, because the matches are happening in South
Korea and Japan, which are 17 time zones away. The first matches of a
day start at 11:30 p.m. PST and last through the night.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been open until 7 a.m. every day since it started," says
Lucky Baldwin's manager, Andreas Teti. The biggest crowds come for
the 11:30 p.m. games, but the pub drew about 100 people for the
England-Argentina grudge match at 4:30 a.m. last week.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team, which hasn't progressed this far in the World Cup
tournament since 1930, takes on three-time world champ Germany at
4:30 a.m. Friday. Other matches to catch this weekend: historical
favorite Brazil against a fired-up England at 11:30 tonight. The
surprising South Koreans come up against Spain Friday at 11:30 p.m.
And Senegal, which dispatched 1994 world champion France in the first
round, plays Turkey at 4:30 a.m. Saturday. Set your VCR or head out
to some of these spots:</TE>
<TE>   Barney's Beanery--Hoping to catch a replay? Barney's boasts eight
satellites and at least 35 TVs, as well as an extra-large pull-down
screen reserved for sporting events of particular import. Don't be
surprised if a match coincides with a karaoke night--every Sunday,
Monday and Wednesday--or, even better, a beer promotion. 8447 Santa
Monica Blvd., West Hollywood, (323) 654-2287.</TE>
<TE>   Britannia Pub--The name should tell you something: If you were
planning to cheer on your British ballers in a peaceful setting, stay
far, far away. If, however, you were planning to watch, yell, kick
and scream with an overflowing crowd and overflowing kegs in a pub
where you can't throw a shot glass without hitting a TV, come on in.
318 Santa Monica Blvd., Santa Monica, (310) 458-5350.</TE>
<TE>   The Cat and Fiddle--With its picturesque courtyard and outdoor
dining, this English pub is a slightly more posh choice, as befits
its Hollywood locale. But when an 11:30 p.m. match comes on the telly
(three of them, including two big-screen TVs), it gets as comfortably
rough-and-tumble as you'd hope for. Try the sausage rolls. 6530
Sunset Blvd., Hollywood, (323) 468-3800.</TE>
<TE>   Lucky Baldwin's--The good news: Watch the U.S.-Germany game live
with your fellow fans Friday at 4:30 a.m. The bad: You can't have a
German or an American beer during the match. The bar will be closed.
So have a cappuccino or orange juice. And they'll be serving a
special menu of bangers with eggs and British bacon. 17 S. Raymond
Ave., Pasadena, (626)795-0652.</TE>
<TE>   National Sports Grill &amp; Bar--Sixty-seven TVs total, including
three big screens, and during any World Cup match, about 50 of them
(roughly 80%) will be spoken for. That doesn't mean that 80% of the
crowd will necessarily be watching or that the bar will fill to its
capacity of 450 people in this post-Lakers season, but it's a capital
choice for viewers who prefer sport, and spirits, over spectacle.
3210 Sepulveda Blvd., Torrance, (310) 534-5700.</TE>
<TE>   Scotland Yard--If rooting for the Yankees isn't your cup of tea
(or mug of ale), join the Anglophiles expected to turn out in droves
for tonight's much-anticipated England-Brazil match. Can't make it?
Don't worry; this charming British pub takes soccer so seriously that
it will open at 4 a.m. just for those pesky late-night matches. By
all means, stop by, if you don't mind tea and sandwiches (the beer
stops flowing at 2 a.m.). 22041 Sherman Way, Canoga Park, (818)
703-9523.</TE>
<TE>   Shamrock Bar &amp; Grill--No big-screen TVs, alas, but Orange County's
soccer-loving Irish oasis still draws crowds of more than 100 people
for the 11:30 p.m. matches. Guinness has made promotional appearances
in the last few weeks, and another one is likely tonight. 2633 W.
Coast Highway, Newport Beach, (949) 631-5633.</TE>
<TE>   Red Lion Tavern--There would be no better place to watch the
U.S.-Germany face-off ... but this Bavarian bar isn't staying open
until 6:30 a.m. The crowds for earlier games vary depending on who's
playing whom, but with an attractive two-story setup, including an
upstairs patio with a big-screen TV, how can you not say "danke
schon?" 2366 Glendale Blvd., Silver Lake, (323) 662-5337.</TE>

<HD>A Comic Gem From Guinness</HD>
<DH>A year after his acting Oscar, his script for 'The Horse's
Mouth' won a nomination</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A year after giving his brilliant, Oscar-winning performance as a
by-the-book British colonel in David Lean's World War II epic, "The
Bridge on the River Kwai," Alec Guinness brought another remarkable
character to the screen in the delightful 1958 comedy "The Horse's
Mouth." This rarely seen gem recently made its DVD debut.</LD>
<LD>   Guinness received an Academy Award nomination for "The Horse's
Mouth," not for his acting, but for his literate screenplay, which he
adapted from Joyce Cary's novel. Guinness plays Gulley Jimson, an
aging, disheveled painter on a search for the perfect canvas. Kay
Walsh, Michael Gough and Mike Morgan also star in the film, which was
directed by Ronald Neame.</LD>
<LD>   The Criterion Collection edition features a lovely new digital
transfer supervised by Neame, who began his film career as an editor.</LD>
<TE>   There is also a recent interview with the veteran director, who
talks about the genesis of the film: Claude Rains first gave him the
Cary novel, but Neame didn't even get through the book because he
didn't think it would work as a movie.</TE>
<TE>   A few years later, Guinness sent him the novel, and, this time,
Neame fell in love with the book and Cary's eccentric characters. In
fact, Neame almost made another movie based on a Cary novel with
Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, but that project never came to
fruition.</TE>
<TE>   On a sad note, Morgan, the 18-year-old actor who plays Gulley's
friend, became ill with a form of meningitis near the completion of
production and died within a week.</TE>
<TE>   Although he had shot all of his scenes, some of his dialogue had
to be dubbed in post-production, so Neame brought in a voice actor
who could mimic Morgan.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD also features the trailer and D.A. Pennebaker's lovely
short documentary, "Daybreak Express," which opened the original New
York theatrical run of "The Horse's Mouth." Pennebaker introduces his
film.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Fairbanks put the D into dashing and the P in panache
during the silent era. Athletic, charming and handsome, Fairbanks was
one of the biggest movie stars of the 1920s. This week, Kino is
releasing three of his great swashbucklers on DVD: "The Mark of
Zorro" (1920), "Don Q, Son of Zorro" (1925) and his last silent film,
"The Iron Mask" (1929).</TE>
<TE>   "The Iron Mask" ($30) was Fairbanks' bittersweet farewell to the
genre and allowed him to revisit his favorite literary character,
D'Artagnan, whom he played in 1921's "The Three Musketeers." Although
he was 46 at the time, Fairbanks still performed stunts with grace
and ease.</TE>
<TE>   The Kino edition features a beautiful transfer of the newly
restored "Iron Mask" print. This version reinstates Fairbanks' sound
prologue to the film.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD also features some wonderful, rare outtake footage,
background essays, artwork and an excerpt from the 1952 re-release of
the film that featured spoken narration by Douglas Fairbanks Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The "Mark of Zorro" and "Don Q, Son of Zorro" are available as a
double feature on one disc ($30). Besides the enjoyable
swashbucklers, the DVD includes rare home movies of Fairbanks in
pre-production on "Don Q," excerpts from a newsreel of Fairbanks in a
mock boxing match with Jack Dempsey and an excerpt from Fairbanks'
1918 book, "Making Life Worth While."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Get out your hankies for "I Am Sam" (New Line, $25), starring Sean
Penn in his Oscar-nominated turn as a mentally challenged man who
must fight to keep custody of his 7-year-old daughter (Dakota
Fanning). Michelle Pfeiffer also stars as his brittle attorney. The
DVD includes a trailer, the wide-screen version of the film, a
comprehensive documentary, several deleted and alternate scenes, and
serviceable commentary by co-writer and director Jesse Nelson. The
DVD-ROM features a script-to-screen comparison.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Norman Jewison's 1975 futuristic action-thriller "Rollerball" has
developed a cult following over the years. It's doubtful any cult
will spring up around the disastrous 2002 remake bowing this week on
DVD (MGM, $27).</TE>
<TE>   Poorly directed by John McTiernan and featuring a script with more
holes than a wedge of Swiss cheese, "Rollerball" stars Chris Klein,
LL Cool J, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and Jean Reno. Originally made as an
R-rated release, the film was edited by MGM to a PG-13 rating. The
DVD reinstates the R-rated version, complete with nudity and gore.
The digital edition also includes a look at the stunts, a music
video, and inane commentary from Klein, Romijn-Stamos (who declares
she wants to talk dirty and does) and LL Cool J, whom his co-stars
refer to as Todd.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colin Hanks, the gangly, talented son of Tom Hanks, gets his first
big film break in the uneven teen comedy "Orange County" (Paramount,
$30), which also stars Jack Black and Schuyler Fisk, the daughter of
Sissy Spacek. Hanks plays an Orange County high school senior who
wants to fulfill his dreams of becoming a writer by attending
Stanford but whose dysfunctional family gets in the way.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD, which will appeal mainly to teens, features two deleted
scenes, 15 funny promotional spots that aired on MTV ("Orange County"
is an MTV Films production), and commentary from director Jake
Kasdan--son of director Lawrence--and screenwriter Mike White, who
are probably both nice guys but sound pretty nerdy on the audio
tract. White also plays Hanks' dimwitted English teacher, who tells
his class that "Gladiator" and "The Talented Mr. Ripley" are both
based on Shakespeare plays.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Despite an earnest performance from Jim Carrey, Frank Darabont's
sentimental drama "The Majestic" (Warner, $27) is anything but. Set
in the early 1950s, "The Majestic" finds Carrey playing a young
Hollywood screenwriter whose career grinds to a halt when he is
accused of being a communist. Attempting to get out of Hollywood, he
gets into a car crash and ends up in a bucolic California town with
amnesia. Martin Landau leads the supporting cast.</TE>
<TE>   The wan DVD features a few additional scenes and the movie within
the movie, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Christian Slater and Val Kilmer headline the straight-to-video
action thriller "Hard Cash," which makes its debut this week on VHS
(priced for rental) and DVD ($20).</TE>
<TE>   The big question is why did these two accomplished actors agree to
make this pedestrian flick?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The best extra on the DVD of the lackluster Disney comedy "Max
Keeble's Big Move" (Disney, $30) is the Ultimate Food Fight game
that's featured on the DVD-ROM.</TE>
<TE>   The object of the game is to throw globs of food in the school
cafeteria at kids and teachers, and score 500 points before you run
out of food.</TE>
<TE>   Alex D. Linz plays Max, a height-challenged junior high student
who decides to stand up to all the bullies who have been tormenting
him after his parents tell him they are going to move.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition also includes a featurette on the young
actor's life on the set, a trivia game, numerous deleted scenes and
commentary from Linz, who is a real chatterbox, and from Jamie
Kennedy, Larry Miller, director Tim Hill and producer Mike Karz.</TE>

<HD>Schaf's Far-Flung Photographs Celebrate the Commonplace</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The artist currently known as Schaf has shown his photography
regularly around the area and is well known for his use of the
reality-filtering visual effects of infrared film. Often, he has
drawn on the dreamy effect to romanticize roadside Americana, in the
Midwest or in Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   With his one-person exhibition "Part of a Bigger Picture" in the
Upstairs Gallery, Schaf spreads his wings a bit, presenting images
from far-flung locales. The softened edges and blurred lighting of
infrared film lend further exoticism to sites that may need no extra
help in the direction of mystery. Among his reports from Europe are
images of a wind-blown lawn chair on a sprawling park green in
London, an outdoor book vendor in Paris, backed by the Seine and an
affectionate view of a toilet in a Munich apartment.</LD>
<LD>   Little things can count for a lot. Interior shots of a slip of a
kitchen in a Paris apartment or a tight shot on a kitchen sink in
Munich are not site-specific pictures from those cities, but they
nonetheless convey a sense of place.</LD>
<TE>   As seen in a shot of cookware in Casablanca, caressed by selective
sunlight, one of Schaf's strong suits is his consciousness--and
essential celebration--of commonplace objects and scenes. It
therefore comes as no surprise that, despite all the more remote
travelogue-like scenes on display here, one of the boldest pieces is
"Strong Shoulder," a close-up portrait of luminous Mason jars.</TE>
<TE>   It could be in Munich, Casablanca or Anytown, USA, anywhere where
the profundity of the trivial can be found.</TE>
<TE>   * "Part of a Bigger Picture," through July 13 at Natalie's Fine
Threads, Upstairs Gallery, 596 E. Main St. in Ventura. Gallery hours:
10:30 a.m.-5 p.m., Tuesdays through Saturdays, noon-4 p.m., Sundays;
(805) 643-8854.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Memoriam: The Ventura art scene lost one of its cherished
denizens with the recent passing of Carol Rosenak. Although
debilitating strokes in 1994 interrupted her creative activity, she
resumed her art-making, in a style more abstract than the warm,
realistic still-life paintings seen in various galleries in the area
over the decades. One of her paintings can be seen in the Ventura
City Hall's second-floor display; it is in the city's permanent
collection.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago native studied at the Chicago Art Institute and worked
and showed in New York and elsewhere, but she landed in Ventura in
the early '70s. For the last several years, she was the wife of
composer John Biggs, and both were actively involved in many corners
of Ventura's art community. She died June 1 at age 76.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nostalgia Ahoy: In the tradition of shows about putting on a show,
"Dames at Sea" is a '60s-vintage musical with the '30s--particularly
the world of Busby Berkeley--on the brain. With book and lyrics by
George Haimsohn and Robin Miller and music by Jim Wise, it's the tale
of tap-dancing chorus girl Ruby and Dick, forced to take their show
on the water, making for a farce replete with seasickness and
foibles. The Conejo Players Theatre is putting on the show starting
this weekend, directed and choreographed by Tami Moore and starring
Mary Sheridan and Arryck Adams.</TE>
<TE>   * "Dames at Sea," Saturday through July 6 at Conejo Players
Theatre, 351 S. Moorpark Road in Thousand Oaks. Performances on
Saturdays through July 6 and Sundays through June 30 at 2 p.m. and
June 30 at 7 p.m. Tickets are $8; (805) 495-3715.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Al Fresco Cinema: The annual "Music Under the Stars" series at the
historic Olivas Adobe is one of the trusty diversions each summer, in
an evocative location. The series begins Saturday, although on more
of a cinematic note than a strictly musical one. The Buster Keaton
classic "Steamboat Bill Jr." will be screened, with Dan Redfeld
supplying the live original score.</TE>
<TE>   * "Steamboat Bill Jr.," at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at the Olivas Adobe.
Tickets are $15 for adults, $13 for children 12 and under and
seniors; (805) 658-4726.</TE>

<HD>Just Riding the Wave</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* With a sound rooted in punk, the Walkmen find
themselves caught up in the N.Y. rock revival and as a result are
being pursued by several major record labels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first time was easy: the high-tension guitar riffs, a spare piano
melody, the off-center rasp of singer-guitarist Hamilton Leithauser.
It was the very first recording session for the Walkmen, their first
moments as a band, and here it was already coalescing into something,
a dark and playful song called "Wake Up."</LD>
<LD>   The sound was both raw and ethereal, where the Velvet Underground
meets Radiohead. That was two years ago, and the result can be heard
on the band's debut album, "Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me Is
Gone," which was finally released in March.</LD>
<LD>   The live show came far less easily.</LD>
<TE>   "At first we were really weird and we really didn't play a good
live show at all," says Leithauser with a laugh. "And we were all
really nervous. We just weren't very good."</TE>
<TE>   The Walkmen, who perform Saturday at Spaceland, have since found
themselves drawn into what many critics and fans are calling a New
York rock renaissance, joining the Strokes and other bands there in a
movement rooted in the sound of straight-ahead, old-school punk rock.</TE>
<TE>   It's an association that Leithauser, 24, has sometimes found
distracting and annoying. His own reference points were actually Joy
Division and Bruce Springsteen, an unlikely blend of punk despair and
roots-flavored rock energy. But there was never any specific plan
during the scattered, early-morning sessions for the album.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just the sound that we got when we started recording," the
singer says. "We have our own studio and it's this really big room.
We really didn't know where they were going to go until they started
to get recorded and we got to hear what they sounded like."</TE>
<TE>   But guitarist Paul Maroon sees an obvious benefit of the New York
rock revival.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been incredibly helpful to us," he says. "I don't think
anybody would care about our band if there wasn't that thing going
on. It's been pretty darn lucky for us, as far as getting people to
hear our record."</TE>
<TE>   That hasn't always been a concern for Maroon. Like most of the
Walkmen, he was once a member of the once-hyped but short-lived
Jonathan Fire*Eater, a band whose brooding 1997 album on the
DreamWorks label, "Wolf Songs for Lambs," won over critics but few
record buyers.</TE>
<TE>   The band broke apart from internal discord less than a year after
the release, and is now the source of endless jokes and derision
within the Walkmen.</TE>
<TE>   On stage, they perform no songs by Fire*Eater. Nor are there any
requests. "I don't think anyone liked our old band," says Maroon, 28.
"Our parents liked us."</TE>
<TE>   Like Jonathan Fire*Eater, the members of the Walkmen are all
originally from Washington, D.C. Leithauser, a cousin of organist
Walter Martin, was in a band called the Recoys. As those bands broke
apart, its members returned to college, and it was two years before
the Walkmen began to take shape.</TE>
<TE>   From sessions recorded in the band's own studio in New York, a
pair of EPs and the debut were released by the tiny Star Time
International label.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, the Walkmen have been approached by a variety of
major labels. The Jonathan Fire*Eater experience was troubled, but
Leithauser says the band was "treated like royalty." Any hesitation
comes from uncomfortable suggestions that the Walkmen adjust their
sound, cleaning things up for mass consumption.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't like anything that's overproduced or anything that
sounds forced," says Leithauser. "Or extraneous stuff that's
irritating."</TE>
<TE>   Either way, Leithauser says the Walkmen hope to have a new album
recorded in their studio by the end of the year. Three new songs are
already part of their set, along with a version of the Kinks' '80s
hit "Come Dancing."</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make it as soon as possible," says Leithauser. "We
don't want to turn it into a bidding war. It's just stupid.
Basically, we want to be able to do the band full time by the time we
do the next album. So we want to be able to do that and have complete
creative control."</TE>
<TE>   Leithauser just left his job of four years with the New York
Metropolitan Museum of Art's online operation. Now he can contemplate
the band's first European tour in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he's been listening obsessively to classic punk albums
by the Ramones and Bad Brains, hoping to bring some of that speedy
intensity to the Walkmen's next album. But not too much.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not like that. We don't play that fast," he says. "I wish
we could, but it would be ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   The Walkmen, with Brandtson and Liars Academy, Saturday at
Spaceland, 1717 Silver Lake Blvd., Silver Lake, 9 p.m. $8. (213)

<LD>At the annual Father's Day pilgrimage to Beverly Hills for the
Concours de Rodeo, the only thing that topped the vintage Duesenberg
on display was running smack into Sharon and Ozzy, the erstwhile
Prince of Darkness. The MTV stars were politely posing for photos at
Two Rodeo, and Sharon looked absolutely radiant. I would too if I
could shop in that 'hood.</LD>
<LD>   Falcon is making its debut tonight. The new Sunset Boulevard club
is at the former Fritzi's Hofbrau.... Forty Deuce, the new club at
the old Kane's, is off the hook. The hourly burlesque shows may have
something to do with it.... And DJ Panic, a.k.a Meredith Chinn, says
the new Standard Hotel Downtown is waaaay nice. She's been spinning
on its rooftop space....</LD>
<LD>   And it don't stop: Paul Stanley of KISS sang "Lick It Up" at the
Viper Room on Monday. In addition, Roxy Sain's new video, for the
song "Firecracker," made its debut that night. Scenesters are already
calling the L.A. singer the female Marilyn Manson.... Looking for a
firecracker of a summertime soundtrack? On L.A.-based Too Rude's
self-titled first record, singer Dog Boy sounds like a long-lost
blues man reborn as a surf punk.</LD>
<TE>   Las Palmas-Joya-Sangria owner Chris Pike tells me he's looking
into opening a new restaurant in Mammoth Mountain, which is being
dramatically overhauled. Apparently, the owners of Dublin's on the
Strip also plan to open a nightclub in Mammoth. Add a Pike-owned
spot, and Mammoth is really back in biz.</TE>
<TE>   Ja Rule and Kevin Costner have been kicking it at Tempest in
Hollywood on Saturdays. Can you say buddy flick?... In more Tempest
news, owner Michael Najjar just bought R.J.'s Restaurant in Beverly
Hills, two doors down from Joya. Excellent move.... DJ Sweeney Fly
Trap, who spins Tuesdays at the Room at 9:30 p.m., blew everyone away
last week with his clever mix of rock and schlock. Think Betty
Blowtorch, the Buzzcocks and the Brady Bunch(!).... And U2 producer
Daniel Lanois is scheduled to perform at Spaceland on June 29.
Achtung, baby.</TE>

<HD>A Hollywood Comeback</HD>
<DH>A popular spot for musicians a decade ago, King King
reopens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HEIDI SIEGMUND CUDA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten years ago, it was all quiet on the western front in Hollywood. In
the years following the 1992 unrest in Los Angeles, the area was like
a ghost town after hours. It's taken a decade, but Hollywood has
dusted itself off and dressed itself up.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest excitement is on star-studded Hollywood Boulevard,
where new nightclubs such as Deep, the Pig N' Whistle, the Knitting
Factory, Star Shoes, Las Palmas and the Highlands have proven there's
still life on the old boulevard. Now, the return of King King, a
beloved L.A. music haven, signals that maybe in Hollywood you can
come home again.</LD>
<LD>   King King, a one-room La Brea Avenue nightclub that thrived in the
late '80s and early '90s, was a music lover's paradise. Its young
owner, Mario Melendez, was a nightlife veteran from East L.A. (his
father owned restaurants and Latino cowboy bars) who worked the door
at Al's Bar in its '80s heyday. King King's roots were in blues, but
it was a blues fused with street knowledge, and the bands that played
there mixed in elements of punk, rockabilly, ska and Latin music. It
became a hotbed of creativity, and artists such as Joey Altruda, Big
Sandy &amp; the Fly-Rite Boys, John Doe and the Solsonics used King King
as the place to expand their repertoires. The acid-jazz nights in
particular became a meeting ground for L.A. and New York artists.</LD>
<TE>   After shuttering it in '93, it took Melendez almost a decade to
reopen King King in a historic brick building at the corner of
Hollywood Boulevard and Whitley Avenue. The "historic" part caused
the delay. Melendez spotted the building in 1998. He started
renovating--until the discovery that the building was a landmark. The
1912 brick structure is one of the last of the French chateau-style
buildings in Hollywood and it took him another four years to work
through the red tape.</TE>
<TE>   It seems worth the effort. After a splashy April opening with a
performance by the Blasters, King King's settled in nicely as a go-to
venue for good music. The blues band the Blue Shadows have a Monday
residency, and Tuesdays are dedicated to Brazilian and Latin music.
Wednesdays and Thursdays emphasize rock, and the weekends mix it up
with DJs and live bands.</TE>
<TE>   To enter the club, guests walk around the building and through the
back, going down a longish hallway before landing in a huge, warm
room. It's versatile too, with a collapsible stage at its far end and
two movable bars that can roll from the back of the club to the
center for easier access on a crowded night.</TE>
<TE>   A music lover and a self-proclaimed motorhead, Melendez designed
the red-hued venue with minimalist, masculine sensibilities. He had
someone who usually custom-paints guitars create a bar top that looks
like the same glittery polyurethane you'd find on a red Telecaster.
Using his hot-rod expertise, he added quick-connect hookups for the
movable bars. King King's brick walls conjure up the feel of the old
Club Lingerie.</TE>
<TE>   Word is already getting out about the new club, and such artists
as Dave Alvin, the Nervis Brothers and Joey Altruda are featured
there regularly. I poked my head in on a quiet weeknight and I felt
some of the ghosts of the old King King. The jukebox was playing Nina
Simone, and Angelo Moore from Fishbone was hanging out for the night.
He'd heard King King had reopened and was looking for some DJ gigs.
He knew he'd find a friendly face. Mando from Royal Crown Revue was
sitting at the bar that night too. Melendez had given Royal Crown
Revue its first eight gigs at the old King King and the musician had
come to pay his respects. (Royal Crown Revue is scheduled to perform
July 4.)</TE>
<TE>   One of King King's coolest features is the jukebox, a testament to
its owner's passion for music. You won't find J. Lo, but you will
find dozens of 45s by artists such as Slim Harpo, Nina Simone,
Screamin' Jay Hawkins and Art Blakey.</TE>
<TE>   It may be too soon to see if King King can rekindle its old
passions in Hollywood. It already has one advantage. While every
other club in the neighborhood charges for parking, King King has its
own 80-spot parking lot behind the club, and it's free to park
nightly.</TE>
<TE>   And no matter how old you are, it's worth stopping by to throw a
coin in that old jukebox. When that big red room fills up with the
sound of Billie Holiday's voice, sparks fly.</TE>
<TE>   It may be too soon to tell what the club's long-term potential is,
but it's already made a good first impression.</TE>
<TE>   King King, 6555 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, (323) 960-5765. 21 and
older. Cover, $5-$10. Open nightly. Free parking in rear.</TE>

<HD>A Real Bright Spot in Mediterranean Fare</HD>
<DH>Eclectic abundance is the hallmark of Haifa, a tiny diner
nestled among delis and bakeries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA HANSEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even at night, it's bright and sunny inside Haifa: The blue sky and
puffy clouds overhead never fade because they're painted on the
ceiling.</LD>
<LD>   A skylight gives an airy feeling, and the ambience is as vibrant
as Haifa's Mediterranean cuisine.</LD>
<LD>   People crowd into this tiny shoebox of an Israeli restaurant at
dinnertime, and lively conversation echoes off the walls.</LD>
<TE>   Haifa is located across from the Elat and Alef supermarkets in a
Los Angeles neighborhood where Jewish delis, bakeries and other
businesses are situated. The restaurant is glatt kosher and closes on
Friday nights, all day on Saturdays and on Jewish holidays.</TE>
<TE>   The eclectic menu ranges from moussaka and tabbouleh salad to
matzo ball soup and cabbage rolls. (Actually, the Israeli-style
moussaka has a lot in common with cabbage rolls. The eggplant slices
are rolled with a beef filling and baked with tomato sauce, rather
than arranged in flat layers with lamb and tomatoes and topped with
custard sauce, as is the Greek moussaka.)</TE>
<TE>   Dinners start with a parade of relishes. Green olives, turnip
spears tinted fuchsia with beet juice and sweet cabbage slaw are
innocent enough, but the Yemenite green sauce z'hug (here spelled
schug) delivers a blast of chile heat.</TE>
<TE>   The Turkish salad is spicy too. In fact, it's more like a salsa
than a salad, consisting of tomatoes, celery and garlic chopped with
hot paprika.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the relishes include pickled vegetables or corn salad
with dill and sweet peppers.</TE>
<TE>   Don't fill up on the relishes, though, because the main courses
are huge. (Order the stuffed baked potato and you get two potatoes,
peeled, cut in half, sandwiched with a fine ground beef filling and
baked in tomato sauce.)</TE>
<TE>   And main dishes come with a choice of two hearty sides, such as
mujaddara (majadra), a rice and lentil hash topped with caramelized
onions. Or green beans in tomato sauce, white beans in tomato sauce
on rice or homemade French fries.</TE>
<TE>   The lightest sides are mixed vegetables with mushrooms and an
Israeli salad of diced tomatoes and cucumbers.</TE>
<TE>   The potatoes are a Wednesday special. Thursday's featured dish is
tender baked lamb, served with its natural juices. It's often sold
out by dinnertime. (Call early and have an order set aside.)</TE>
<TE>   A Cornish hen stuffed with beef and rice is so tender it falls
apart. The chicken schnitzel can be a little dry, but Haifa's grilled
meats, basted with garlic, paprika and other seasonings, are very
good.</TE>
<TE>   A grill combination includes beef and chicken kebabs, a ground
beef kebab and a rather bony, fatty lamb chop. The kebabs also come
in pita sandwiches.</TE>
<TE>   Haifa's shawarma is marinated turkey. Try it on hummus or in a
pita sandwich. Other homey, well-cooked, satisfying main dishes
include stuffed peppers, meatballs, baked chicken legs and rib steak.</TE>
<TE>   An appetizer salad platter on the next table was so handsome I had
to have it too. The big platter holds five cold dishes: hummus,
tahineh sauce, baba ghannouj, creamy red cabbage and Israeli salad,
plus six golden brown falafel balls. The falafel is green inside,
because the garbanzo bean mixture is ground with parsley.</TE>
<TE>   Matzo ball and chicken soups are a safe bet, but spicy Yemenite
beef soup is a standout. Curiously, it resembles curries I've tasted
in south Indian restaurants overseas. At home, I would serve it over
rice.</TE>
<TE>   Haifa has two desserts, both pareve (kosher with either meat or
dairy meals). Malabi is enchantingly exotic. It's an unsweetened,
water-based cornstarch pudding unmolded onto a plate, surrounded with
rose syrup and sprinkled with chopped walnuts and fine shreds of
coconut.</TE>
<TE>   The delicate mousse cake is a mound of kosher vanilla pudding
combined with whipped nondairy cream, set on a slim layer of
chocolate. It's covered with chocolate frosting and chocolate syrup,
but the main sensation is of airy lightness, almost like a
marshmallow.</TE>
<TE>   The only problem at Haifa is the service. The waiters are pleasant
and helpful, but there aren't enough of them on busy nights, when

<LD>* Here's a quick way to sample a chef's range.</LD>
<LD>   Saddle Peak Lodge: Chef Warren Schwartz's menu is grilled white
asparagus with St.-Agur blue cheese and candied walnuts, foie gras
"pastrami" on toasted rye, seared "Himalayan beef" (yak) loin and
frozen mascarpone souffle with wild strawberries and toasted
hazelnuts, garnished with basil. (Tasting menu, $65.) Saddle Peak
Lodge, 419 Cold Canyon Road, Calabasas, (818) 222-3888.</LD>
<LD>   Mako: Chef-owner "Mako" Tanaka might make fried oysters with
basil, tomato and tapenade, sauteed baby abalone with basil garlic
sauce, baked diver scallops with sea urchin (uni) sauce, snapper in
sake paste, Wagyu beef short ribs and five-spice lamb osso buco. If
you're up to it, he has seasonal desserts too. (Omakase menu, $70.)
Mako, 225 S. Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills, (310) 288-8338.</LD>
<TE>   Golden Truffle: Chef Alan Greeley can deliver three or four
courses in an hour and 15 minutes. He asks your likes and dislikes,
then creates dishes such as crawfish with green tomatoes in a bloody
mary vinaigrette, or Sicilian swordfish with dried figs and preserved
lemons. Dessert might be a tropical fruit sorbet with spicy lace
cookies. (Four courses, $45; three courses, $25.) Golden Truffle,
1767 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa, (949) 645-9858.</TE>
<TE>   Water Grill: Every day, chef Michael Cimarusti puts together a
menu of seven courses, including a cheese course and two desserts.
Some recent dishes have been white asparagus with American caviar;
Copper River salmon with salsify puree, porcini mushrooms and summer
truffles; and pineapple-lemongrass granita. (Tasting menu, $85.)
Water Grill, 544 S. Grand Ave., downtown L.A., (213) 891-0900.</TE>
<TE>   Joe's: If you call two days ahead, Joe Miller will tailor a menu
for you; if you don't, he'll put together a six- to eight-course menu
from what's available in the kitchen. Dishes include polenta with
sofrito sauce, or roasted rack of wild boar with white beans, globe
carrots, pickled fennel and green garlic sauce. Dessert might be
garnet cherry soup topped with cherry sorbet and lemon creme fraiche.
(Tasting menu, $65-$85.) Joe's, 1023 Abbot Kinney Blvd., Venice,

<LD>   R. Kelly Pleads Case--</LD>
<LD>   Over the Airwaves</LD>
<TE>   R&amp;B singer R. Kelly, facing 21 felony counts of child pornography
charges, has avoided the spotlight in recent weeks. But he's now
addressing the scandal in a song given exclusively to a radio station
in his hometown.</TE>
<TE>   WGCI-FM, a popular hip-hop and R&amp;B channel in Chicago, began
playing "Heaven I Need a Hug" this week. The song is slated to be on
the singer's next album, scheduled for release late this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Heaven I Need a Hug" features Kelly's familiar tenor and
burnished grooves with lyrics describing the scandal as a product of
celebrity. "It's all because I'm famous/You know what I'm sayin'/I
mean if I wasn't famous/Then all this wouldn't be happening/I'm just
being real."</TE>
<TE>   He also sings "church folks, you need to stop judging" and tells
women "stop depending on us men/start depending on the man above."</TE>
<TE>   The charges against Kelly stem from a now-notorious 26-minute
videotape, widely distributed via the Internet and black-market
vendors, allegedly showing him in a sexual liaison with a girl police
say was 14 at the time. The Grammy-winning singer denies he is the
man in the tape.</TE>
<TE>   Eminem Still No. 1</TE>
<TE>   on Album Sales Charts</TE>
<TE>   Eminem's "The Eminem Show" album continues its torrid sales pace,
selling another 530,000 copies last week to retain its No. 1 spot on
the national chart for the fourth week. The album has now sold 2.9
million copies since its release last month, according to Nielsen
SoundScan.</TE>
<TE>   Hard-rock group Korn sold 434,000 copies of its "Untouchables"
last week to debut in the No. 2 spot. The other positions in the Top
10 are held, in order, by the fifth volume in the "Totally Hits"
compilation series, New Found Glory, P. Diddy, Ashanti, "O Brother,
Where Art Thou?," Kenny Chesney, Donell Jones and Avril Lavigne. 'N
Sync's pairing with Nelly on "Girlfriend" remains the nation's
bestselling single.</TE>

<TE>   Tests Confirm That Bing Is the Father</TE>
<TE>   DNA tests have determined that Hollywood producer Steve Bing, who
sparked a tabloid frenzy when he questioned the paternity of
Elizabeth Hurley's baby, is indeed the father of the 2-month-old boy.</TE>
<TE>   The test results were disclosed Wednesday at a hearing in the
Family Division of the High Court in London. Bing had initiated the
paternity proceedings shortly after the baby was born.</TE>
<TE>   Hurley, a 37-year-old actress ("Austin Powers") and model, has
always maintained that Bing is the father and could now receive
millions of dollars in child support. Bing, believed to be heir to a
$400-million property fortune, has said that if Damian Charles Hurley
was shown to be his, he'd be an "involved and responsible parent."</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Billy Joel, 53, has checked into Silver Spring Hospital in New
Canaan, Conn., for a 10-day stay for treatment of substance abuse....
R&amp;B star Brandy and her husband, Robert Smith, became parents of a
girl on Tuesday.... NBC is purchasing the remake rights to the hit
BBC show "Coupling," a comedic look at love and lust among
thirtysomethings. The pilot is being viewed as a potential
replacement for "Friends." ... "The Scorpion King's" star, the Rock
(a.k.a. Dwayne Johnson), has made a deal to play Hawaii's most famous
warrior-king, Kamehameha the Great, in a movie for Sony Pictures.</TE>

<LD>Singer-songwriter Rosie Thomas began her set at Spaceland on Tuesday
by explaining that she used to do stand-up comedy. You probably
wouldn't have guessed that from listening to her delicately emotional
tunes.</LD>
<LD>   But her exaggeratedly self-conscious between-song patter did
foreshadow her encore appearance as Sheila, a hapless, monosyllabic
pizza-delivery girl with a neck brace, thick glasses and a major
thing for Leonardo DiCaprio.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas' sense of humor wasn't so obvious in her songs. Yet the
material, drawn mostly from her solo debut album on the Sub Pop
label, "When We Were Small," has a thoughtful, lighthearted honesty
that reflects a woman who is comfortable with her goofiness.</LD>
<TE>   Performing alone with acoustic guitar and sometimes backed by a
three-piece band, the Seattle-based artist mixed folk, country and
alt-pop in numbers inspired by reflections on her childhood.</TE>
<TE>   Such memories could easily turn cloying, but Thomas was never
overly precious or histrionic, despite addressing such formative
challenges as her parents' divorce.</TE>
<TE>   Her clear, high singing recalled Joni Mitchell, and Thomas' direct
delivery set her apart from so many shoe-gazing indie-pop sensitive
souls. Also appealing was the underlying sense of resiliency in such
selections as "Wedding Day," which treated the end of a marriage as a
blissful fresh start.</TE>

<LD>* New this Week: They haven't renamed "The Shipping News" as "How
Quoyle Got His Groove Back," but that's pretty much what they've
turned E. Annie Proulx's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel into. With
Kevin Spacey miscast as the oafish Quoyle, this is the latest
installment in director Lasse Hallstrom's ("Cider House Rules,"
"Chocolat") apparently endless series of unconvincingly
life-affirming productions. "Shipping News" also follows its
predecessors in its zeal to reduce complex literary material to
predictable, audience-friendly elements. With Judi Dench, Scott
Glenn, Pete Postlethwaite, Rhys Ifans, Gordon Pinset and Julianne
Moore.</LD>

<HD>From 'Woyzeck' to Yo-Yo Ma</HD>
<DH>The Arts* An eclectic roster of theater and music is
scheduled for the annual UCLA Live season in 2002-03.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA Performing Arts will present 199 performances of 86 events,
including its first international theater festival, as part of its
UCLA Live 2002-03 season.</LD>
<LD>   The mix includes spoken-word artists including NPR's Sarah Vowell,
concert appearances ranging from the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson to
Brazil's Caetano Veloso to cellist Yo-Yo Ma, and mini-festivals of
silent movies, avant-garage music led by Pere Ubu's founder David
Thomas, and a lineup to be determined of a multi-day music festival
curated by "The Simpsons' " Matt Groening.</LD>
<LD>   The director of the series, David Sefton, said the theater
festival is "a response to my coming into town and seeing what was
missing from the bill of fare in Los Angeles, including American
work. Almost half of the companies weren't being asked to come to
town. Robert Wilson's work has hardly ever been seen in L.A. I've
seen more of it in London than in L.A.. That seemed very odd."</LD>
<TE>   Among the seven companies presenting eight productions, visionary
theater director Robert Wilson has teamed up with rock poet Tom Waits
and longtime partner and collaborator Kathleen Brennan for a new
musical production of George Buchner's nightmarish fable, "Woyzeck."
Created for Denmark's Betty Nansen Theatret, this will be the only
performance of "Woyzeck" outside of New York.</TE>
<TE>   Italy's revolutionary Societas Raffaello Sanzio will mount two
U.S. premiere productions, including "Genesi: From the Museum of
Sleep," a story leading from the expulsion from the Garden of Eden to
Auschwitz, and "Giulio Cesare," a reworking of Shakespeare's text,
both in exclusive engagements. Groups from Holland, Germany, France
and the U.S. complete the festival.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the theater festival, the Kronos Quartet will be in
residence during the season with two events currently
scheduled--"Nuevo," an exploration of Latin music, with guests, and
the world premiere of "Visual Music," a UCLA commission.</TE>
<TE>   Other events include the touring program that celebrates the 50th
anniversary of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company; David Thomas'
"Disastodrome!" a three-day festival of avant-garde rock artists, and
"Washington Square Memoirs," which re-creates the early '60s' folk
music scene in Greenwich Village.</TE>

<HD>The Art of Mime in 'A Feast of Fools'</HD>
<DH>The talents of Geoff Hoyle and assistant Gina Leishman work
best outside the box of stuffy sophistication.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LA JOLLA--"A Feast of Fools," which made its world premiere Sunday at
the La Jolla Playhouse, is a 90-minute tour de force in the art of
mime by veteran comic Geoff Hoyle.</LD>
<LD>   Whether this is a tour you want to take probably depends on your
level of interest in mime, a rarefied art that can either be
fascinating or frustrating. If you need an occasional one-liner or
verbal put-down, hie thee to the nearest comedy store.</LD>
<LD>   "Fools" was conceived and written by Hoyle as a kind of capper to
25 years of mime, acrobatics, juggling and pratfalls.</LD>
<TE>   Although the spotlight is mainly on Hoyle, his accompanist, Gina
Leishman, nearly steals the show. With the deadpan looks of Imogene
Coca and a touch of Victor Borge-like piano shtick, Leishman is a
wonderful second banana. She also has the evening's only words, a
respectable sendup of Marlene Dietrich singing a torch song.</TE>
<TE>   But "Fools" is Hoyle's show, and he's determined to make the most
of it. He's limber and rubber-faced and, although some of the bits
are overlong, he rarely misfires.</TE>
<TE>   Aficionados will remember Hoyle as Zazu in the original Broadway
production of "The Lion King," for which he won a New York Drama Desk
award. He performed "Don Quixote de La Jolla" for the playhouse in
1990 and toured with Cirque du Soleil and the Pickle Family Circus.</TE>
<TE>   "Feast of Fools' " funniest skits are those with the most visual
appeal and least attempt at intellectualizing. (No, he does not walk
against a wind machine or find himself trapped in a box.)</TE>
<TE>   Hoyle's dueling waiters--one slick, one bumbling--and his
incompetent but lovable magician are the evening's highlights. His
Mr. Sniff, a fellow with an improbably canine-ish nose, makes no
linear sense and thus is a delight.</TE>
<TE>   Less successful is a prolonged take between Hoyle and a puppet on
a stick, which seems to have something to do with death and dying.
Less is more, even in mime.</TE>
<TE>   And Lily Tomlin long ago retired the bit of an adult dressed as a
tot, sitting in an oversized highchair.</TE>
<TE>   The poignancy of "Mr. Brown's Rendezvous" (the skit titles are
flashed above the stage) wears thin, and his show-ending ages-of-man
seems optional.</TE>
<TE>   Lighting designer David Cuthbert does a wonderful job of light and
shadows and different colors as background.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with "Fools" and with mime as entertainment is that it
easily becomes self-reverential. You get the feeling there is a
caption: You're watching comedy for the thinking person and you are
very sophisticated for being here.</TE>
<TE>   The playhouse does not just embrace this concept, it hugs it and
rolls around the carpet with it. Lest we forget that others have used
mime, the theater is decorated with immense portraits of Chaplin,
Keaton, Harpo Marx and others.</TE>
<TE>   Say what you will about your average stand-up wannabe, he or she
does not require immense portraits of Henny Youngman and Bob Hope as
props. Some things really are best left unsaid.</TE>
<TE>   "A Feast of Fools," La Jolla Playhouse, La Jolla Village Drive and
Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla. Tuesday-Saturday, 8 p.m. Sunday 7 p.m.
Saturday and Sunday, 2 p.m. Ends July 14. Tickets: $19-$49. (858)
550-1010. Running time: 90 minutes.</TE>

<LD>Rock Is Catch: Hans Rockenwagner will reopen Rock in Marina del Rey
as Catch Seafood early next month. He's remodeled it in a
Cape-Cod-meets-Venice style and hired Frank Spingman, former
executive chef of the Flying Fish in Seattle. Rockenwagner describes
the new menu as interesting without being fussy, with dishes such as
striped bass with Mission fig-fennel salad and scallop pot pie..</LD>
<LD>   * Catch Seafood Restaurant and Bar, 13455 Maxella Ave., Marina del
Rey. (310) 822-8979.</LD>
<LD>   Mojitos on Melrose: Xiomara Ardolina, who popularized the Mojito
cocktail at Xiomara/Aye in Pasadena, is planning to open a restaurant
in September named for Cienfuegos, the city where her mother was
born. On the menu: arroz con pollo "the real way," garbanzos and pig
feet, mamey shakes. "It's 100% Cuban," she adds with a smile. And
there may be the secret of her wonderful Mojitos.</LD>
<TE>   * Cienfuegos, 5101 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A Bit of Martha's Vineyard: New Englander Brad Johnson, a partner
in such hot spots as Roxbury, the Sunset Room and Georgia, has gone
solo to create Menemsha, named for a town in Martha's Vineyard. Along
with architect Nina Briggs, Johnson has created a large, open space
with fireplaces and lots of stained wood. The menu will include
stuffed quahogs, clam chowder, steamers and lobster rolls, and
there'll be a large raw bar featuring cherrystone and littleneck
clams. You'll also find many of the Italian and Portuguese dishes
that have entered New England cuisine. Scheduled to open in mid-July.</TE>
<TE>   * Menemsha, 822 Washington Blvd., Venice. (310) 822-2550.</TE>
<TE>   Women, Wine and Antipasto: Lucques co-owners Suzanne Goin and
Caroline Style are planning to open a new place on 3rd Street in
early fall. No name yet, but they know what it's going to be: a wine
bar offering up to 50 wines by the glass, where you can try flights
of interesting, inexpensive, lesser known wines. "Seventy-five
percent of the list will be under $75," says Styne excitedly, "making
it really accessible for people to try a wide variety." Goin adds,
"We wanted to create a restaurant that was like the subculture that's
developed at the bar at Lucques." The menu will include cassoulet,
short ribs with arugula and aged balsamic vinegar and clams and
mussels cooked in a wood-burning oven. There'll also be an extensive
list of cheeses, pates and smoked meats. The design should be in the
sleek, modern mode of Lucques, since it's also designed by Barbara
Barry.</TE>
<TE>   Small Bites: McCormick and Schmick's is serving Alaskan Chipnik
salmon for the first time in this country starting (drum roll, drum
roll) June 26 ....Experience the epicurean charms of Venice Tuesday
when Joe's Restaurant hosts the chefs of Abbot Kinney Boulevard's
restaurant row, including Joanna Moore of Axe, Francis Bey of Lilly's
and Corey Corson of Primitivo Wine Bar ....Chef's Collaborative, the
chefs' group that promotes sustainable agriculture and mariculture,
will be holding a benefit at Lucques on June 30. The L.A. members
cooking are Fred Eric (Vida, Fred 62), Brooke Williamson (Zax), Mark
Peel (Campanile), Evan Kleinman (Angeli), David Wynns (formerly of
Les Deux Cafe) and Suzanne Goin (Lucques). They'll be joined by a
large group of important local organic farmers. It'll be $45 a head.
Lucques, 8474 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood, (323) 655-6277....If
you've always dreamed of designing a restaurant, this UCLA Extension
class is for you: "Restaurant Design: an On-Site Study Tour." It
includes a tour of L.A.'s hottest restaurants as well as a lecture in
which designers, restaurateurs, and managers will talk about the
concept behind some of L.A.'s dining locales. For information, call
UCLA Extension at (310) 825-9061.</TE>

<HD>Who's Watching the Watchdogs? TUNED IN</HD>

<LD>Enron has become a symbol for everything that's wrong with Wall
Street and Corporate America.</LD>
<LD>   The energy trader's stunning collapse exposed a watchdog system
that was supposed to protect investors but failed to sound alarms
about the company's dubious finances. As many investors are painfully
aware, the conflicts of interest on Wall Street and in executive
suites go well beyond Enron and its discredited accounting firm,
Arthur Andersen.</LD>
<LD>   In tonight's "Frontline" presentation, "Bigger Than Enron" (8
p.m., KCET), correspondent Hedrick Smith examines an oversight system
gone soft and asks: Why did the safeguards fail, and what's being
done to fix them? Smith offers no simple solutions, but a frank
discussion of the issues.</LD>
<TE>   "Many of these so-called corporate watchdogs are paid by the
corporations themselves," says investment manager Jim Chanos, noting
that auditors, bond-rating agencies and brokerage analysts often are
compensated, at least indirectly, by the companies they cover.</TE>
<TE>   In the six months since Enron imploded, change has come slowly,
but Harvey Pitt, head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, says
his plan for accounting reform, being unveiled this week, will
restore investor confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Viewers may nod in accord when Smith replies, "I hope you're
right."</TE>

<LD>Davenport obituary--The obituary of Olympic gold medalist Willie
Davenport in Wednesday's California section incorrectly reported that
he lived in Baton Rouge, La. He lived in Falls Church, Va. Identified
as a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard, he was actually a
colonel in the Army National Guard. Also, he is survived by three
children, not one as stated in the obituary. They are Willie
Davenport Stewart Jr. of Youngstown, Ohio; Tonya Davenport Morris of
Monroe, La.; and Mark Davenport of Baton Rouge. Marian Davenport,
identified in the obituary as his wife, is actually his ex-wife.</LD>

<HD>To Andrew Bosse on a Special Day</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Al Martinez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Andrew:</LD>
<LD>   I was at your bar mitzvah the other day. I was invited by your
grandmother, Rose Toren, who is so proud of you. She wanted me to
see, in a way, how far the generations of her family have come since
her own dark history at the hands of the Nazis a lifetime ago. She
wanted me to see that pride never dies.</LD>
<LD>   You stood up there as straight as a young tree in a vast forest,
even at 13, poised and self-confident, eager--as the young are--to
step grandly into tomorrow. You can hardly wait, I know. We were all
that way once, as eager as puppies to play in the street.</LD>
<TE>   I was impressed by the talk you gave, embracing, as it did, an
understanding that the boy doesn't grow alone. That in the forest of
your infancy and on up to that rite of manhood, others have watched
over you, advising and teaching, protecting you against often
bitterly hostile forces, so that you might someday protect those who
follow.</TE>
<TE>   Your audience at the dignified old Wilshire Boulevard Temple was
filled with friends and family, and with people like me who never
stop realizing how much we have to learn from each other, including
the nature of rituals that mark the stages of our lives.</TE>
<TE>   You displayed humor when you thanked your mother, Lili, as the
boss in the family, and your dad, Jon, for having taught you about
"sex and sports." The audience laughed, as it should have, but there
are those of us who wished we had fathers who took the time to teach
us about the truths and the dangers of growing up.</TE>
<TE>   So much lies ahead.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know how many times we've heard, Andrew, that the past is
prelude to the future. The writer Edna Rostow acknowledged it by
saying, "Everyone is a child of the past." That's you and me. That's
Lili and Jon. That's all who were in the audience that Saturday at
your bar mitzvah.</TE>
<TE>   Your grandmother knows about the past. Rose was a year younger
than you are now when the Nazis came to her small town in Poland,
where the family of seven, your ancestors, lived. They rounded up the
Jews and took them into an open field. They told them to stay there,
they'd be back in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   There were four sisters and a brother. One sister, Eda, wasn't
going to wait. She fled into the darkness and was never seen again.
The father told Rose to save herself, and she ran to the home of a
friend who helped her obtain papers that identified her as a
displaced Christian. Rose survived, even escaping from Auschwitz
after her true identity was learned, coming to America to tell her
story in books. She has returned to Poland many times, seeking the
fate of her family. She learned that her mother and another sister
had died in a concentration camp. She discovered that the Nazis had
murdered her father, brother and the fourth sister in that open
field, on that starry night.</TE>
<TE>   The mystery of Eda remains. Where did she go? Where did the
darkness take her? "I have a feeling she is still alive," Rose told
me one day, "and I tell you I will find her."</TE>
<TE>   No photographs of Eda exist, Andrew--only a face in the memory of
your grandmother, a haunting smile, fragments of laughter. She's a
part of your yesterdays. Of the world's yesterdays. Know your past.
Our past. Study it. Remember it.</TE>
<TE>   The history of the Jews is filled with tears. But time embraces us
all, so that your history is our history, your pain our pain, your
guilt our guilt. As children of the past, we all play in the debris
of lives and cultures ruined by the bomb, the gun, the sword and the
arrow.</TE>
<TE>   We've come a long way through time since the first club was
fashioned. Who knows how much further we'll be able to go when the
club is transformed into the kinds of weaponry that can outkill in an
instant all the wars in human history?</TE>
<TE>   But your rabbi, Harvey J. Fields, could still talk of a world
without war, wisely citing that portion in a prayer book that says,
"Dark and twisting is the road to peace." Dark and twisting indeed.</TE>
<TE>   One hears cries of reason amid the gunfire that rocks the ancient
Holy Land, but they die in the thunder of a war still unfinished. The
cries are not just from diplomats and politicians, but from men and
women protecting their young, as you were protected, Andrew. Jews and
Muslims alike. Hindus and Christians too.</TE>
<TE>   The cries haven't yet reached God's ears. We still tread the dark
and twisting road.</TE>
<TE>   This I wish for you, Andrew, as you walk bravely into the
tomorrows our pasts have created. I wish for you a deep compassion
for those who suffer, whoever they are, whatever they are. I wish for
you the strength of leadership and the wisdom that is so severely
lacking in the areas of armed conflict we witness today.</TE>
<TE>   Stride past the hatreds that darken the twisting road. Stand tall
when others tremble. I wish for you that fortitude. And I wish you
love and caring and the ability to share them with others. I wish you
life, my boy. Shalom.</TE>

<HD>A First Film in the Cards</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>GINA PICCALO AND LOUISE ROUG</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Cigar smoke chokes the small, unair-conditioned room tucked behind
the kitchen of Little Joe's, the shuttered Italian restaurant in
Chinatown. A dapper Sylvester Stallone sits at a poker table with
five other men, his sturdy hands working a deck of cards. The camera
occupies one corner. Thandie Newton slinks around in a red dress
while sleight-of-hand expert Paul Wilson guides the actors on their
next move. Behind them is a table stacked with $2 million in fake
cash.</LD>
<LD>   It's just before noon on day 15 of the shooting of "Shade," a
picture about card sharks starring Stuart Townsend, Gabriel Byrne,
Jamie Foxx, Melanie Griffith and Stallone. The film is a first for
writer-director Damian Nieman, 32, a Loyola Marymount grad who 18
months ago was working nights and living off credit cards.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly, the room is silent. All eyes are on Stallone.</LD>
<TE>   In this, the film's climactic end scene, his character, a
legendary card player known as "the Dean," is going up against a
young con artist (Townsend). Stallone cuts the cards, deals them and
delivers a line he will repeat half a dozen times during the next
hour: "Looks like everybody's going the distance."</TE>
<TE>   Nieman wrote "Shade" after spending months around the world's best
"card mechanics," many of whom he met at the Magic Castle in
Hollywood, and was planning an independent production, but within
months, Stallone was attached to the picture. Nieman is still amazed.</TE>
<TE>   Stallone walks off set to joke with the makeup artists and get a
quick back rub. After several takes to get the card-cutting scene
just right, he holds his hands out and cracks a joke. "As you can
tell, these hands are not meant for dexterity," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Then he wanders over to offer advice to actor Jason Cerbone
(Jackie from "The Sopranos") on playing the "young Stallone." "You
know the Mona Lisa?" Stallone asks his eager protege. The actor nods.
"It's that sly smile.... People can't read you. That's all it is."</TE>
<TE>   The Birthday 'Border Girl'</TE>
<TE>   A microphone crackled, and the crowd inside Le Meridien's bar on
Tuesday night cocked their heads quizzically, trying to locate the
voice. "I'm ... excited ... to ... here," said the headless voice,
which belonged to birthday girl Paulina Rubio, who turned 31 the day
before. The belated birthday party doubled as a release party for her
new album, "Border Girl."</TE>
<TE>   In the background, a stream of Rubio's music videos played,
soundlessly, on TVs above the bar. Scattered on tables and near a
fountain outside were copies of People en Espanol, an issue dedicated
to "las 25 bellezas Latinas." Rubio was No. 1, the cover girl. (Her
album "Paulina" was the biggest-selling Latin album in the U.S. last
year.) And although her image was ubiquitous this night, it was easy
to miss the actual Mexican-born singer and actress. Well-wishers
easily obscured the little star, who wore a sky-blue slinky dress and
sat on a corner couch in the back.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Sharon Zadanoff, acupuncturist to the stars and Rubio's
confidante, sat nearby.</TE>
<TE>   "She gives and gives and gives," said Zadanoff. "I know it doesn't
look like it right now," she said, as Rubio received yet another
silver-wrapped present. "But she has to be [available]. Always 100%."</TE>
<TE>   On cue, a couple came for a photo with the singer. Rubio gave a
smile.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is coming together," said Rubio. No, she was not
surprised to find herself feted like this in L.A., she said. She was
only grateful. "It's yin and yang, you know," she added,
philosophically. "The planet is getting smaller, It's like my music,
global."</TE>

<LD>AMERICAN SCOUNDREL</LD>
<LD>   The Life of the Notorious Civil War General Dan Sickles</LD>
<LD>   By Thomas Keneally</LD>
<TE>   Doubleday</TE>
<TE>   360 pages, $27.50</TE>
<TE>   The Civil War is the greatest story of American history, judging
from the thousands of books written not only about its epic battles
and its heroes but also about those who played small parts.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Sickles is, at most, a bit player. In "American Scoundrel: The
Life of the Notorious Civil War General Dan Sickles," Thomas Keneally
writes that Sickles directed one of the more controversial maneuvers
as a Union corps commander at the Battle of Gettysburg by getting his
troops into a stronger but more exposed position. It was a gambit
that he paid for by losing a leg in the battle.</TE>
<TE>   Other than that, he is a distinctly peripheral character. His
varied career was marked by terms in Congress, a friendship with
President Lincoln, diplomatic assignments in Britain and Spain and a
key role in the establishment of New York City's Central Park. Most
interesting, at least to this author, he was an actor in a scandal
that saw his young wife enter into an affair with Philip Barton Key,
the son of the writer of our national anthem. When Sickles found out,
he killed Key in 1859.</TE>
<TE>   In a trial that was the entertainment of the day, Sickles was
found not guilty, or perhaps it might be said the jury came to the
conclusion that his gunning down of the unarmed Key in Washington's
Lafayette Square was justifiable homicide. His lawyers gave the jury
an excuse, contending that Sickles was suffering from temporary
insanity at the time, a defense that apparently had not been used
successfully until then.</TE>
<TE>   Sickles--a passionate man, it seems, at all times--never forgave
his wife, Teresa, for her transgression, and in her short life before
she died at 31 of tuberculosis, he never treated her decently again.
But soon after 1859, Sickles became a Union general and a friend of
Lincoln.</TE>
<TE>   Was he a "scoundrel" in the dictionary definition of that term, "a
mean, immoral, wicked person, a rascal"? In many respects, yes.
Keneally, author of "Schindler's List" among other books, certainly
makes a big point of Sickles being a politician not above taking
bribes and a man guilty of much lascivious behavior. After all,
rather than take his beautiful young wife to London on his first
diplomatic assignment, he took his mistress, Fanny White, a known
prostitute. And then he took White to a royal reception, palming her
off as the daughter of a New York newspaper publisher who had been
critical of him.</TE>
<TE>   This is being scoundrelly, no question, and the author makes the
most of it. But it also becomes clear that Sickles has a few
redeeming qualities. A Northern Democrat sympathetic with the South,
he nonetheless casts aside these associations when the Union is in
jeopardy and volunteers to be a leader of Union troops. He may be a
political rascal, but he also stands up to the call of duty.</TE>
<TE>   And Keneally is not exactly another Shelby Foote as a historian. A
gap in the historical record doesn't stop him. When documents are
lacking, Keneally speculates a little too freely on a few too many
occasions. While as a novelist he certainly has such license, it
leads one to wonder how much of the real Sickles gets lost in
Keneally's narrative. "American Scoundrel" is an entertaining book,
but for the history of the era, for the real Civil War, it is best to
turn to Foote.</TE>

<HD>Stories That Helped Her Fill In the Blanks</HD>
<DH>Writer Karen Brennan used narrative to aid her daughter's
recovery from a major brain injury</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEVERLY BEYETTE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now, almost seven years after the motorcycle accident that left her
24-year-old daughter severely brain-damaged, Karen Brennan struggles
to put into words how "the most profound experience" of her life
changed her, fearful of sounding too New Age-y as she speaks of
having become more spiritual, of having a new view of the world.</LD>
<LD>   Brennan has chronicled the experience movingly--with an occasional
dose of black humor--in her new book, "Being With Rachel: A Story of
Memory and Survival" (W.W. Norton).</LD>
<LD>   A professor of creative writing at the University of Utah, fiction
writer and poet, Brennan deals daily in narratives and, as she sat
bedside through her daughter's four-month coma, she would try to
break through to Rachel by telling her daughter over and over who she
was, from her premature birth to her years as a school track star in
Arizona. Inventing what she couldn't remember, Brennan would persist
above the beeps and hisses and gurgles of the machines that were
keeping Rachel alive.</LD>
<TE>   The smallest flicker of an eyelid would give Brennan hope. Then,
one day, Rachel whispered, "I want my mom." "When she woke up she was
pretty oriented to who she was and where she was," Brennan says. At
first she was in a wheelchair, but after months of physical therapy
she is now able to walk with the aid of a cane, albeit it slowly and
off-balance.</TE>
<TE>   As she recovered, "I'd give her little writing assignments, try to
get her to think of narratives," Brennan said. Rachel had lost her
short-term memory, and, Brennan reasoned, "Maybe narrative generates
memory instead of vice versa." Over and over, she answered her
daughter's questions: "Where am I? What day is it? What year is it?"</TE>
<TE>   Brennan knew that the function of the brain cells, or neurons, is
to convey information accumulating along a complex circuitry of other
neurons to produce thoughts and actions--and that when either
transmitters or receptors are interfered with, memory is
incapacitated. She began to see parallels between brain theory and
the theories of narrative she taught her graduate students--that an
author's style and chosen structure might be a kind of map of the
brain and, therefore, a map to the way a person remembers.</TE>
<TE>   Brennan thought encouraging Rachel to write stories might
jump-start her memory. The experiment met with limited success. "Tell
me a story," Brennan would urge. "Make something up." At first,
Rachel's stories were far from being narratives. She would write,
"There is Justine with a bee on her head." When Brennan prompted,
"What about Justine? What about the bee?" Rachel shrugged, "That's
it. The end."</TE>
<TE>   In time, "she did improve, up to a point," Brennan says, but even
when she began giving her stories endings, they were "childlike,
really primitive," and when Brennan would praise her effort--"not
bad"--Rachel was apt to ask, "What was the story again?"</TE>
<TE>   Brennan persisted and saw the payoff. "As Rachel's narrative sense
gets better, her memory gets better. People are always astounded [to
see] a person with brain injury who is eloquent and very funny. She
did a [bookstore] reading with me the other night, and she was
terrific. Years ago she would have gotten confused halfway through.
She's much more sequential now."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel has retrograde amnesia, typical of those who have suffered
severe brain injury and lengthy coma, which means that she may recall
things from the remote past, but not things that happened more
recently. Erich Hansen, a Tucson neuropsychologist who has worked
with Rachel, believes Brennan's approach was "immensely important" in
redeveloping Rachel's sense of self by "cueing her to remember things
that she had remembered well but had trouble retrieving."</TE>
<TE>   Hansen says Brennan's use of narrative to jog Rachel's memory
helped give Rachel some coherence in her drastically disrupted life.
But, he adds, "I don't think the narrative approach would necessarily
facilitate new learning."</TE>
<TE>   Poor Prognosis</TE>
<TE>   "Being With Rachel" begins in August 1995, with an early morning
phone call from a neurosurgeon at Denver General Hospital to Brennan,
who was summering in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. Rachel had been
in a motorcycle accident near Steamboat Springs, Colo., and was in a
coma. The doctor said her CAT scan was "very, very ugly."</TE>
<TE>   She had not been wearing a helmet. The diagnosis: Diffuse axonal
injury. Or, as Brennan puts it, "It was kind of like a giant
whiplash." Despite being prepared for the worst--including grim
predictions from a social worker described by Brennan as "queen of
the false-hope cops"--Brennan refused to have her hopes dashed.</TE>
<TE>   Post-accident, Brennan's team included her two
ex-husbands--Rachel's father and stepfather--as well as brothers
Chris and Geoff, sister Margot and Margot's husband, Steve Kerr, the
professional basketball player now with the Portland Trailblazers. On
a recent visit at the Pacific Palisades home of Kerr's mother, Ann,
Brennan talked about Rachel and the book.</TE>
<TE>   At first--as Brennan was introduced to a grim world she describes
as "a particularly grisly episode of 'ER,' " a world of ventilators
and monitors and tracheostomies--Rachel's doctor prepared Brennan for
the worst: "We don't know if Rachel will wake up or not. We may have
to make some family decisions." The first encouraging sign came in
the third week when Rachel opened one eye and, with her thumb, began
caressing her mother's hand.</TE>
<TE>   Describing Rachel's fight for recovery, Brennan neither portrays
herself as a martyr nor soft-pedals the realities. Six months after
the accident she brought Rachel home and, as a single woman trying to
balance her career and be caretaker to her daughter, she felt
overwhelmed and inadequate, as though she and Rachel were moths
"trapped between screen and window," batting their wings in futility.</TE>
<TE>   There were times when she thought of ending it all--for both of
them. "Rachel would be screaming about wanting to die. She was so
unhappy. There seemed to be nothing anybody could do. I used to just
look forward to the time she would go to sleep. I would get down on
my knees in front of God and I'd pray."</TE>
<TE>   The doctor advised her to leave the house when Rachel was having
those outbursts, but, Brennan says, "it just felt wrong, with someone
screaming about wanting to die." Instead she'd go to her bedroom, put
a pillow over her head and "pretend this was happening to someone
else."</TE>
<TE>   But in chronicling the experience, Brennan says, she did not want
to write a horror story. "I wanted to write a tribute to Rachel.
She's shown amazing courage. She just has this great spirit." And she
thought writing about it "might deliver me to hopefulness."</TE>
<TE>   Her account does not whitewash what she calls the "grotesqueries"
that accompany brain injury. Among these were Rachel's lack of
inhibition, which led her to say outrageous things at the most
inappropriate times, and confabulation, the fabrication of wild
stories to compensate for memory loss. She developed a disconcerting
guffaw of a laugh--haw-haw-haw. And, alarmingly, she announced one
day that she'd had sex with a man who drove her home in a pizza
delivery truck. Due to her willfulness, tactlessness and
inappropriate behavior, she was labeled a misfit at several
vocational rehab facilities. The frustration, perhaps, felt by this
former free spirit and ski bum.</TE>
<TE>   Finding Serenity</TE>
<TE>   A onetime lapsed Catholic, Brennan has become "sort of a
non-lapsed Catholic. I now go to church and I believe in the power of
prayer. There's something about turning your life over to a force
that's greater than you that brings you some sort of serenity."</TE>
<TE>   In writing of Rachel's struggle, Brennan spares no medical
details. But, she says, the only thing that Rachel, once a toned
runner, objected to seeing in print was that she had gained so much
weight during the months of medication and inactivity. "She
ultimately gave me grudging permission to say it."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel, contacted by telephone in Salt Lake City, said, "I love
the book. It kind of makes me feel like a hotshot because I'm the
main character. I like to read about myself because my memory is like
totally freaking out."</TE>
<TE>   What bothers Rachel most are her physical limitations. "My right
hand's really out to lunch. I had to learn to write with my left
hand."</TE>
<TE>   Her fluency in Spanish remains intact, burned into her memory, and
she hopes to use it to get a job. "I'm so ready just to work like a
normal human being. I really would like a job, that and a boyfriend;
then I'd be perfect."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel's loss of short-term memory may be permanent. But her sense
of humor is unaffected. Brennan tells of her daughter recently
showing her a new address on a letter from a friend. When Karen asked
who the friend was, Rachel replied, "I have no idea. But I think just
for the comic value of it I might initiate a correspondence." She
recognizes people she knows when she sees them but, Brennan says,
"she just doesn't remember where she knows them from."</TE>
<TE>   Today Rachel has an apartment in a group transitional living
center for the disabled about five miles from Brennan's home in Salt
Lake City. Letting go has not been easy for either of them, but
Brennan felt she "had to do the tough-love thing," that Rachel would
not progress if "mother was hanging around remembering everything for
her." She sees her almost daily. "When I'm not there being her mom,"
Brennan says, she copes. "She figured out on her own how to take two
buses to my house."</TE>
<TE>   Brennan still worries about Rachel's judgment and has warned her
repeatedly not to hitchhike. "She doesn't have much judgment about
consequences, which is a narrative thing--'I'm doing this, and this
might happen.' She was always such a tough girl. She thinks if she
gets in trouble, 'I'll just run away from this guy, or fight him.' "</TE>
<TE>   Progress yo-yos. The bad moods, marked by hours and hours of
screaming and aggressive behavior, were found to be a reaction to
Ritalin. When Rachel was switched to Risperdol, a mild antipsychotic,
"it was like a miracle," Brennan says. "Rachel's never going to be
the able-bodied person she was before. But I have high hopes for her.
I hope that I can see her employed, having a routine every day,
having a circle of friends she sees every day, maybe a boyfriend,
having a life. Not a spectacular life, but an ordinary life that she
can feel proud of."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Brennan asked Rachel, hypothetically: If there were a
surgery that would make you whole again, would you want it?</TE>
<TE>   To which Rachel replied, "I don't think I would." Placing her hand
over her heart, she said, "I've learned too much that I wouldn't want
to let go of, all the stuff this has given me."</TE>

<HD>A Writer Intent on Rallying the Spirit of Survival</HD>
<DH>Poet June Jordan cast a penetrating eye on issues both
political and personal</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let fly that graying mantra--"The personal is political"--and it
scares up grainy icons of resistance: pickets, protest songs, afros
huge as nimbuses. But for poet, essayist, teacher and activist June
Jordan, who came of age as a woman and a writer in a moment when the
once-powerless moved mountains, the merger of public and private was
more than fashion. It was her foundation.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan, who died Friday at her home in Berkeley after a
decade-long battle with breast cancer, spent her life stitching
together the personal and political so the seams didn't show.</LD>
<LD>   "She really walked her talk," says award-winning L.A. poet Ruth
Forman ("Renaissance," Beacon Press, 1999), who studied with Jordan
at Berkeley in the early '90s. "She influenced me more than any other
poet. If there was something going on in the world that she thought
we should struggle against, she would be the first person to speak at
a rally."</LD>
<TE>   Poet Michael Datcher, whom Jordan mentored through his own
difficult days at Berkeley, agrees. "Her commitment to truth in her
own life was the source from which her poetry came. Her example of
pursuing truth and justice is what inspired us to take on the mission
in our own lives."</TE>
<TE>   The author of 28 books, Jordan saw the page as a powerful
platform. As an African American woman, she was particularly attuned
to the struggle of not simply finding a voice but truly being heard.
Her lifelong activism addressed issues ranging from racism, education
and police brutality to conflicts in the Middle East, Nicaragua and
Africa. And involvement in such issues lent a serrated edge to her
writing--no matter the form. "She epitomizes a particular kind of
strength of American poetry," wrote poet Marilyn Hacker, "that of the
politically engaged poet whose commitment is ... joined to her work
as it is to her life."</TE>
<TE>   Rough Beginnings</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's early life provided a textured back-story for her work,
tough years that would become first a window, then a prism. Born in
Harlem in 1936 to Jamaican immigrants, Jordan watched her parents
struggle for a foothold. Her mother, a nurse, was quiet, intensely
religious. Her father, a postal worker, came to the United States in
his late teens and taught himself to read and write. But after the
family's move to Bedford Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, Jordan's father
became prone to fits of anger and violence--much of it directed at
his daughter. Many years later she would write of the abuse in
"Soldier: A Poet's Childhood" (Basic Civitas Books, 2000). She was
never quite sure what inspired his rages: "My father had to withstand
tremendous humiliation and also fear," she said in a 2000 interview
in Z Magazine. "[He] was afraid that he would fail to prevent me from
failing." Her father wanted her to be fearless, a soldier, as he
prepared her for "life as a black person in this country."</TE>
<TE>   Camping, fishing and mastering tools weren't the only things that
Granville Jordan considered survival essentials for a daughter he
referred to as "this child him my son." He also made poems and novels
part of her arsenal. He brought home Shakespeare, Sinclair Lewis and
Zane Grey, broadening the landscape of her imagination. And, instead
of Langston Hughes and Richard Wright, black writers of the moment,
she sank into the familiar worlds and cadences of Paul Laurence
Dunbar, whose poetry celebrated the lilting speech of black folk.</TE>
<TE>   Literature took hold in ways she couldn't have imagined. She
memorized English poets and sold verse to neighborhood friends who
needed the right words to break off a relationship. "I got connected
to people as far as what they were really feeling and jittery about
or excited about," she told Z Magazine. "I loved that connection and
I was crazy about the fact that other kids trusted me that I wouldn't
miscarry what they meant. I'd do my best.... From that I got the idea
that poetry could be useful."</TE>
<TE>   Her love affair with language propelled her through her a rigorous
course of studies in prep school, then college, but she ultimately
graduated into the civil rights and black aesthetic movements of the
'60s and '70s, where her heart remained. The electricity of a climate
of fast-forward change evinced to her that the impossible could be
made possible every day. Her commitment to the struggle for black
rights--joining the Freedom Riders, meeting Malcolm X--proved to be
pivotal and galvanizing. But it took a personal toll, dissolving a
10-year marriage to Michael Meyer, a white student with whom she had
a son, Christopher.</TE>
<TE>   Her life as a working single mother in the mid- to late '60s,
recovering from her own mother's suicide, greatly influenced her work
and sharpened her focus. She made her mark writing about both social
revolution and the close space of relationships with equal urgency
and intimacy, refusing to be pigeonholed. That determination was
underscored in the refrain of "Poem about My Rights: "I am not wrong:
Wrong is not my name / My name is my own my own my own."</TE>
<TE>   Her first collection of poetry, "Who Look at Me" (Ty Crowell Co.,
1969), a series of poetic fragments about black identity in white
America, set the tone for her literary aspirations. It became clear
that for Jordan, as important as it was to deal with issues that
bedeviled African Americans, it was imperative that these concerns,
perspectives and joys be expressed in a voice that sounded immediate
and familiar: "Who see the roof and corners of my pride / to be (as
you are) free? / WHO LOOK AT ME?"</TE>
<TE>   She kept her stage broad. Jordan worked as a research associate
and writer for the technical housing department of Mobilization for
Youth in New York. And with architect R. Buckminster Fuller, she
worked on an environmental redesign project for East New York, a
project that won the 1970-71 Prix de Rome for environmental design.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways her imagination stayed that course--suggesting many
blueprints for looking at and living life, all pressing at
possibility.</TE>
<TE>   Much of her life was dedicated to the laboratory of the
classroom--at Yale, Sarah Lawrence, City College in New
York--encouraging a new generation not just to speak, but to speak
up.</TE>
<TE>   "People will remember her for her poetry and essays," says Charles
Henry, professor and chair of African American studies at Berkeley,
"but she was a dedicated teacher. When she first came to Berkeley, I
was shocked when she asked to teach freshman comp. Even graduate
students don't want to do it, it's so labor-intensive. But here is
this internationally known person saying she wanted to teach
freshmen!"</TE>
<TE>   Jordan founded the Poetry for the People program at the University
of California, which provided outreach to local high schools, church
congregations and correctional facilities as well as university
students from all disciplines--"100 people," recalls Henry,
"biologists, architects, lining up for poetry."</TE>
<TE>   Forman recalls Jordan's passion and rigor. "She was not an easy
teacher. She really encouraged you to be honest with your work, so
that meant you needed to be honest with yourself. That would bring up
scary things ... but she would push us to go through that fear with
our poetry. She encouraged us to look at the fullness of life. She
told us anybody can complain, but you can celebrate it too. So what I
carry with me the most is to be honest and unafraid."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan reassured students like Forman that poetry was not "some
high language that you trade in high buildings. It's about creating
ideas to envision and create a better place."</TE>
<TE>   All the while, Jordan continued to publish across the map,
swinging from form to form as the occasion or topic demanded. Through
poetry, essays, plays, journalism, even children's literature, she
engaged such topics as race, class, sexuality, capitalism, single
motherhood and liberation struggles around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   Pushing Boundaries</TE>
<TE>   According to the Norton Anthology of African American Literature,
Jordan was one of the most prolific contemporary African American
writers. And she continued to push boundaries and open new doors even
after her breast cancer diagnosis. She became a columnist for the
Progressive--offering analysis on a range of political topics,
foreign and domestic. In 1995 she was part of a three-way
collaboration with composer John Adams and director Peter Sellars on
the musical "I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the role of the poet, said Jordan, "is to deserve the
trust of people ... to be as honest as possible and to be as careful
about the trust invested in you as you possibly can."</TE>
<TE>   However, the task of a poet of color added another dimension: "The
task of ... a black poet, as a people hated and despised, is to rally
the spirit of your folks. I feel that more and more consciously over
the last 10 years. It's not OK for me if I'm despairing and angry and
bitter to go out in public. I have to get myself together and figure
out an angle, a perspective, that is an offering, that other folks
can use to pick themselves up, to rally and to continue ... to
accomplish something." For Jordan it wasn't fashion but function:
"Being cool, cool was a matter of style. But being brave," she wrote
in "Soldier," "was a matter of virtue."</TE>

<DH>Ed Sampson turned a ranch into a botanical dream, planting
flora that thrive at a lofty 4,000 feet</DH>

<AU>ROBERT SMAUS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TEHACHAPI--To see very different garden flora in Southern California,
you don't have to go far; you simply have to go higher, 4,000 feet
above sea level to this former ranching and railroad town. Here a
garden, planted under majestic 400-year-old valley oaks, is filled
with interesting plants that are difficult to grow closer to the
coast, such as bright orange oriental poppies, leafy hostas, lilacs
or aptly named beautybush. It's also home to heat-loving oaks,
madronos, manzanitas and other native plants.</LD>
<LD>   Mourning Cloak Ranch, named after one of California's most
distinctive butterflies, is a 30-acre botanical garden surrounding
the home of retired entomologist Ed Sampson, 74. He and his wife
Marian, who died in 1998, bought the ranch in 1973 after a five-year
search for a piece of property that could be a botanical garden. Not
many gardeners have such ambitions. Today, the garden is open to
visitors six days a week. About 9,000 toured it last year.</LD>
<LD>   When the Sampsons first found the old cattle ranch nearly 30 years
ago, it took them about five minutes to make up their minds to buy
their dream property. Even though he was trained as an entomologist
and ran his own agricultural chemical company in the Central Valley,
Sampson had a horticultural background.</LD>
<TE>   As a student in Arizona, he worked at nurseries and even
landscaped Frank Lloyd Wright's innovative circular house designed
for Wright's son. In the 1950s, he raised freesias and gerberas on
rented land in Malibu for the cut flower market.</TE>
<TE>   But he didn't know much about growing plants at an elevation of
4,000 feet. When he moved up here, the only place to buy plants was
at the feed store and it didn't have much of a selection. So Sampson
began collecting, propagating and growing plants himself. He figures
that 80% of his garden plants were raised on the premises, from seed,
cuttings or liners (tiny potted plants used as starts).</TE>
<TE>   The Sampsons planted everything--the pines, blood-twig dogwoods
and the grand English oaks--but not the huge old valley oaks (Quercus
lobate), although Ed has been known to tease visitors by telling them
that he planted those as well. The biggest of these oaks is 72 feet
tall, 128 feet across.</TE>
<TE>   Marian Sampson, who was not a gardener when they moved here,
quickly became one. She used to say that her fingernails were long
and her hair short before the move, but her fingernails quickly
became short and her hair long once they started planting the
property.</TE>
<TE>   Ed has kept careful records of his plantings and has learned what
will grow at this elevation. For instance, although most people call
Tehachapi's climate mountain-like, he considers it more like the high
desert.</TE>
<TE>   The air is very dry and the wind-blown desert town of Mojave is
only 20 minutes away. "We can grow Joshua trees up here," he said,
"but it's too dry for hemlocks."</TE>
<TE>   It gets hot but temperatures seldom go over 100. "Last summer we
had our hottest day in 29 years, when it got to 105." High desert
differs from the low desert of Palm Springs in that winters are very
cold, so plants freeze. "It's not all that different from
Afghanistan, Turkey, Iraq or Iran," said Sampson, who pointed out
that many of the plants he grows come from those countries with cold,
nearly snowless winters.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't snow much in Tehachapi, but it gets "cold enough to
freeze the ground," according to Sampson. His garden's record low was
13 degrees below zero in 1990, and 10-degree nights are common. "We
usually get a couple of 5-degree nights each winter." That means no
bougainvillea, no palms, no citrus. Most of the signature plants of
Southern California are missing; many of our winter flowers, such as
Iceland poppies and calendulas, do just fine here if they are planted
in the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Long, cold winters let Sampson grow things more commonly seen in
New England. The first thing he planted back in the '70s was an
herbaceous border next to an old red horse barn, which became so
filled with New England asters and eastern goldenrod that a
photograph of it ended up in a book on New England wildflowers.</TE>
<TE>   The garden began with 20 acres and Sampson slowly added another 10
as adjacent properties became available. His plantings now include
some 2,600 distinct species. In 1990 he took a step few gardeners
dare. He began offering guided tours through his garden after joining
the American Assn. of Arboretums and Botanical Gardens. Recently the
garden has been open for self-tours.</TE>
<TE>   In spring, which comes late here--usually toward the end of
May--you can see such Southern California rarities as Kolkwitzia
amabilis or beautybush, a deciduous shrub from China that looks like
a pink cloud in spring, with long, arching branches that are covered
with pink bellflowers. Planted nearby are rows of Viburnum trilobum,
the cranberry tree that visitors confuse for some kind of hydrangea
(the common hydrangea freezes here). In summer there are many
perennials flowering and even in fall you will see sights uncommon in
the Southland, like a northwestern vine maple turning color, along
with the golden cottonwoods and poplars.</TE>
<TE>   Sampson is especially fond of California natives. One of the few
places where you can easily see wild stands of gold-flowered
fremontodendrons is right across the valley from his ranch. One of
his favorite plants, the silktassel (Garrya elliptica), grows nearby.
He planted a number of elegant silktassel bushes on his hillside, as
well as loads of heat-loving manzanitas (his favorite is named
"Sunset") and even madronos, an elegant red-barked native tree common
up north. There are spreading colonies of penstemon and
sulfur-flowered buckwheat (Eriogonum umbellatum) surrounding benches.</TE>
<TE>   Salvias and minty monardellas are favorites and these sages and
coyote mints thrive in country like this. The scent permeates the
mountain air, mixing with the sweet scent of pine. Sampson selected
and propagated one particularly colorful coyote mint, Monardella
"Marian Sampson," which he named after his wife. It has won such
praise for being a strong grower that it became the Pacific
Horticultural Foundation's plant selection for the year 2000, another
feather in the cap for this home-grown botanical garden.</TE>

<LD>'Ladybug, Ladybug, Fly Away Home'</LD>
<LD>   When you find a ladybug, do you sing this rhyme? You might want to
change the words after you read this.</LD>
<LD>   Ladybugs are good garden visitors because they don't eat plants,
but they do eat small insects called aphids. Aphids damage roses and
other plants by chewing on them. Some people even buy little boxes
filled with hundreds of ladybugs at the plant nursery. They release
the ladybugs in their gardens, hoping to get rid of the aphids.</LD>
<TE>   Ladybugs are actually beetles, called "ladybird beetles" in some
parts of our country. Even though we call them "ladies," there are
male and female ladybugs. The female ladybug lays her eggs on a leaf.
When an egg opens, a ladybug larva emerges, looking like a small
caterpillar. It is covered with black bristles and orange spots, and
it is very hungry. Just like its parents, it eats aphids--lots of
them.</TE>
<TE>   As the larva eats, it grows; and as it grows, its skin gets too
tight and splits open. The larva wiggles out of the old skin and
keeps on eating aphids. This happens several times. When the time
comes for it to become a ladybug, it stops eating and curls up. Its
skin becomes hard. Inside that hard skin a wonderful change, or
"metamorphosis," is taking place. When the hard skin tears open, a
ladybug appears--hungry, of course. Hungry for aphids! The ladybug
will look for them right where it emerged, maybe in your garden. But
if it doesn't find any, the ladybug has wings to fly away and look
for lunch in someone else's garden.</TE>
<TE>   That's why, the next time you find a ladybug, you might want to
sing the rhyme this way: "Ladybug, ladybug, make this your home. We
have lots of aphids; you don't have to roam."</TE>
<TE>   Children and ladybugs are very welcome at Descanso Gardens. For
more information, call (818) 949-4200 or visit www.Descansogar
dens.org.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Germany-based Bulthaup, whose design work is built on the Bauhaus
tradition, has been selling high-quality modular European kitchen
equipment since the 1950s. Historically, this was necessary because
many European kitchens don't come with cabinets, shelves or even
sinks. Pieces had to be bought separately and could be relocated
along with the owner.</LD>
<LD>   As the idea of the encompassing kitchen and family room in one
large room started to become popular in the 1980s, Bulthaup in 1985
introduced a kitchen workbench that was an ergonomic turning point
for the company since it contained cook tops, sinks and food
preparation areas in one unit for indoor or outdoor use.</LD>
<LD>   Ratcheting mobility up one step further, two years ago Bulthaup
introduced System 20, which Bulthaup vice president and design
director Christopher Tosdevin calls "kitchen Legos."</LD>
<TE>   Geared toward a younger generation that moves from city to city
and house to house with each new job, System 20 offers more than 30
possible design combinations, depending on the owners' needs, their
willingness to be open to new ideas and, since a small customized
kitchen can start at $20,000, the size of their bank accounts.</TE>
<TE>   In an illustrated book on the equipment, Bulthaup modules are
found under staircases, near swimming pools and in the middle of
rooms, perhaps leading to a new guessing game, "Who moved the sink?"</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing a need for reduced design and more functional,
intelligent pieces that have no decoration for decoration's sake,"
says Tosdevin. For Bulthaup owners, this flexible system allows
individual pieces to be moved outdoors, when weather permits, from
the indoor kitchen. All the modules are made of anodized aluminum so
they won't rust, and some are on castors for easy mobility, such as a
food preparation unit that can be customized with four shelves or
with added stainless-steel drawers. Bulthaup's System 20 is
definitely not your ordinary outdoor barbecue. In Los Angeles,
Bulthaup has a showroom at 1435 S. Robertson Blvd., (310) 288-3875.

<TE>   Stacking Your Deck With Handsome Furniture</TE>
<TE>   Outdoor furniture should make life outside easier, with no added
frills or fuss. It also has to be comfortable, functional and
good-looking. As a bonus, it would be nice if it could also work
indoors.</TE>
<TE>   London-born William Emmerson of Emmerson Troop Inc., who's lived
in Los Angeles for nearly 10 years, designs pieces that fit those
criteria. His 3-month-old outdoor furniture line, made from
industrial-grade aluminum and steel, could work in either area, but
its strength makes it especially good outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at the outdoor furniture that was available, and it all
seemed flimsy, cheap-looking, throwaway stuff," says Emmerson. "I
felt there was a need for something that had the air of quality about
it."</TE>
<TE>   Emmerson, whose main influence is architect Mies van der Rohe,
master of the Bauhaus "less is more" philosophy, worked for almost
two years to get exactly what he wanted.</TE>
<TE>   "I begin with an idea, and then I keep paring it down until it has
the presence of absence," he says. Emmerson tries to attain a
seamless whole with no distracting elements for the eye to focus on.
And although the pieces seem simple, it's deceptive simplicity, since
his sleek chaise longue alone has 120 parts to it, all welded
together and handcrafted by one man. Upholstered in brightly colored
weather-resistant Sunbrella, the furniture is as eye-catching as a
Mondrian painting.</TE>
<TE>   Emmerson is now working on additions to this line: an ottoman for
the chair, and a bench. "It's not easy creating a new product," he
says, "especially since I'm such a stickler for detail, but I think
there is a demand for quality furniture both inside and out."</TE>
<TE>   Pieces range from $475 to $2,200 at Emmerson Troop Inc., 8111
Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles. (323) 653-9763 or www.em mersontroop.com.</TE>

<HD>The Crossword Puzzle Present</HD>
<DH>Part 4.  The story so far: Rachel and Matt are still trying
to solve the puzzle so they will know what things they need to go
with Uncle Don's surprise present. Here's what they've solved: 4
across, "bowls"; 1 down, "crateorbox"; 3 across, "clock."</DH>

<LD>"Some clocks tick," Rachel said. "I have one! Dad gave me his old
clock when Mom gave him the one that lights up."</LD>
<LD>   "Hmmmm," her brother, Matt, said. "I remember hearing something
about a ticking clock, and I can't remember what it was!"</LD>
<LD>   After dinner Rachel said, "I've got to finish my crafts project. I
have to bring it in tomorrow."</LD>
<TE>   She got the pipe cleaners, the macaroni and a pair of scissors.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you have to do to it?" Matt asked.</TE>
<TE>   "First I have to give the dog legs," Rachel said. She took a pipe
cleaner, bent it in the middle and twisted it onto the dog's body
near the head. Then she took another pipe cleaner, bent it in the
middle and twisted it on near the tail. She put macaroni on both of
the pipe cleaners. Then she bent the ends of the pipe cleaners so
that the macaroni wouldn't fall off.</TE>
<TE>   "There!" Rachel said. And she tried to stand the pipe cleaner dog
on the four legs. It fell over.</TE>
<TE>   "Try bending the feet so they all go in the same direction and lie
flat on the table," Matt said.</TE>
<TE>   "OK," Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   And she did. The pipe cleaner dog stood up.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks, Matt," Rachel said. "Now the ears. I only need half a
pipe cleaner for those." She took the scissors and cut a pipe cleaner
in half. She twisted one of the halves around the head of the dog so
that it made two ears, one on each side. Each ear pointed up. She put
some macaroni on both of them.</TE>
<TE>   "That really does look like ears!" Matt said. "What's next?"</TE>
<TE>   "Well," Rachel said, "I'm really done, but I think I'll make a
collar for my dog."</TE>
<TE>   "It won't take you long to make a collar," Matt said. "Let's do
more of the puzzle."</TE>
<TE>   "All right," Rachel said.</TE>
<TE>   She got the crossword puzzle and a pencil.</TE>
<TE>   "No. 2 down," Matt said. "This has bristles that keep hair
smooth."</TE>
<TE>   "That's easy!" Rachel said. And she printed the letters in the
spaces.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Faces Loss of L.A. Franchises</HD>
<DH>Cable: City attorney threatens to revoke operator's
contracts if service doesn't improve.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Worried that the financial problems at Adelphia Communications Corp.
are hurting the cable operator's 250,000 local customers, City Atty.
Rocky J. Delgadillo threatened Wednesday to revoke the company's five
Los Angeles franchise agreements because of contract violations.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia, the nation's sixth-largest cable operator and the
biggest in Southern California, is on the verge of filing for
bankruptcy protection after a major accounting scandal. Federal and
state regulators are investigating Adelphia because of disclosures
that the company's founding Rigas family borrowed $3 billion backed
by the corporation without shareholder's knowledge.</LD>
<LD>   To stave off bankruptcy, Adelphia has been trying sell some of its
assets, including the prized Los Angeles cable systems, but has not
been able to strike a deal.</LD>
<TE>   Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan has put together a team
to explore the possibility of purchasing Adelphia if it goes into
bankruptcy, according to sources involved in the effort.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia's troubles were a central topic at Wednesday's City
Council meeting. Councilman Jack Weiss demanded that the city
attorney's office and the local cable regulatory board provide an
exhaustive rundown of the city's options regarding negotiations to
renew Adelphia's franchises. And he said he wants a strategy for the
city if the cable operator files for bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   "We may be able to threaten to revoke the franchises, but what
good does it do us if it denies a quarter of a million people of
television service?" Weiss said. "We need a comprehensive strategy to
protect customers given the limited number of options we have."</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia is the only cable provider in Eagle Rock, Sherman Oaks,
Boyle Heights, the East San Fernando Valley and West Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Various cable executives, city officials and bankruptcy experts
say that customers probably will notice little change in service if
Adelphia files for bankruptcy protection because a bankruptcy judge
is unlikely to jeopardize the monthly bills for cable and high-speed
Internet service that are Adelphia's only source of revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the prospect of a bankruptcy has set off anxiety among
Adelphia's 3,000 local workers.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's on pins and needles," said an employee who asked not
to be identified. "There are new rumors every day. What happens if
they sell the company or file for bankruptcy? Will I still have a
job?"</TE>
<TE>   Over the last three weeks, Adelphia let go subcontractors who were
hooking up about half of the company's new cable and high-speed
Internet customers. That set off speculation within the work force
that other bills might not be paid by Adelphia's headquarters in
Coudersport, Pa. An e-mail from a regional Adelphia manager
instructed personnel to fuel up all company vehicles because of fears
that Adelphia's gasoline credit card bill had not been paid. For two
days last week, some of Adelphia's two-way dispatcher radios were
shut down because of an apparent billing problem.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia officials said that all radios were back up by Friday
afternoon and that local offices were doing their best to operate on
a business-as-usual basis.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Delgadillo said lapses in customer service have put the
company in violation of its city contract. He complained about
extended waits by customers on Adelphia's telephone help lines and a
failure by the company to provide digital services, such as
high-speed Internet access, in all areas of its franchises.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo said the city offered to help Adelphia in efforts to
sell L.A. cable systems to ensure continued service and speed any
sale.</TE>
<TE>   At stake for the city is an estimated $7 million a year in
Adelphia franchise fees. Cable operators pay the city 5% of their
cable revenues every quarter. Adelphia recently paid the city about
$1.7 million, and was late in making that payment, local officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The city also worries that many Adelphia customers do not have
digital services that are available elsewhere in Los Angeles. Only
50% of Adelphia's L.A. customers can sign up for digital service.</TE>
<TE>   Industry experts say a bankruptcy filing could further delay the
digital conversion, spurring customers to defect to satellite and
other alternative providers. Satellite TV rivals already are
targeting Adelphia customers because of recent rate hikes and are
contemplating new marketing campaigns.Another complicating factor for
the city is that Adelphia's five cable franchises expire Aug. 2. The
city's cable regulatory board is expected to vote July 8 on whether
to renew Adelphia's contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "One option is to extend Adelphia's contracts with conditions,"
said Liza Lowery, the city's recently appointed chief information
officer, whose Information Technology Agency oversees cable
regulation. Another option, she said, is to let Adelphia's contract
expire and put the company on a month-to-month deal.</TE>
<TE>   Local cable executives say giving Adelphia a short-term extension
might ensure that the city has a say should the company file for
bankruptcy protection or sell the local cable system. The city must
approve any franchise transfer.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ChevronTexaco Corp., the second-biggest U.S. oil company, said it
expects an additional $400 million in savings from the merger of
Chevron Corp. and Texaco Inc. by April, up 22% from earlier
estimates.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based company increased the annual savings
target to $2.2 billion and said it expects to meet the previous goal
of cutting $1.8 billion in costs by October.</LD>
<LD>   In a presentation to analysts in New York, ChevronTexaco Chief
Executive David O'Reilly and other company executives outlined plans
to reduce worldwide refining and marketing costs by as much as $700
million next year. The company also plans to boost annual production
and return on capital by as much as 3%.</LD>
<TE>   The company was formed in October through the $45.8-billion merger
of Chevron and Texaco. O'Reilly said at the time that he expected
annual savings of $1.2 billion from the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, ChevronTexaco has announced plans to cut 4,500 jobs
and has sold its stake in Texaco's U.S. refineries and gas stations.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of ChevronTexaco fell $1.83 to $86.60 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<LD>   It was the first meeting of the newly constituted nine-member
board. In late May, dissident shareholders won a 6-3 board majority
that was hostile to longtime ICN Chief Executive and Chairman Milan
Panic. O'Leary was one of the dissident candidates elected in that
vote.</LD>

<HD>U.S. Probe Targets Memory Chip Firms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Justice Department has launched an antitrust investigation into
whether semiconductor manufacturers manipulated prices in the
$11.2-billion memory chip market.</LD>
<LD>   Federal investigators issued subpoenas to Micron Technology Inc.,
Samsung Electronics Co. and Infineon Technologies, the companies
confirmed Wednesday. In addition, Hynix Semiconductor Inc. received a
request from U.S. regulators for information, a South Korean news
agency reported.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation comes as the memory chip business struggles
against weak demand for personal computers.</LD>
<TE>   All but one of the companies contacted by the Justice Department
posted losses, and analysts were puzzled by the timing.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to catch a crook, you look at who's getting rich,"
said David Wu, vice president of research at Wedbush Morgan
Securities in Los Angeles. "Right now, they're all losing money."</TE>
<TE>   Micron, Samsung and Infineon said they would cooperate with the
investigation. Executives for Seoul-based Hynix could not be reached
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The four companies control 80% of the global market for dynamic
random access memory, or DRAM, chips used in personal computers and
other electronic devices. Analysts estimate that Micron and Samsung
each have a 25% share of the DRAM market, while Hynix has 20%, and
Infineon has about 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Justice Department declined to answer questions
about the probe.</TE>
<TE>   Micron acknowledged that it received a grand jury subpoena Monday.
"Micron does not believe it has violated U.S. antitrust laws," Kipp
A. Bedard, Micron's vice president of corporate affairs, said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   A downturn in PC sales last year led to a 60% decline to $11.2
billion in DRAM sales, the industry's steepest drop. Prices for
128-megabyte chips hovered around $2.50 on Wednesday. Prices, which
have been as high as $20 a chip, hit $1 in November before rising to
more than $4 in March.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the single most competitive sectors in the
semiconductor industry," said Dan Scovel, analyst with Needham &amp; Co.
in New York. "It takes huge investments. It has extremely volatile
market characteristics. It's a nightmare for business planning."</TE>
<TE>   With the DRAM business in a tailspin, analysts are puzzled by the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the four companies posted losses last year. Micron, based
in Boise, Idaho, lost $625 million. Based on Wednesday's exchange
rate, Munich, Germany-based Infineon lost $564.9 million in 2001. And
Hynix lost $4 billion last year. Only Samsung, which also makes
televisions, cell phones and other electronic gadgets, was
profitable.</TE>
<TE>   The memory chip market has been so fiercely competitive that
companies in recent years have traded accusations of "dumping," or
flooding the market with low-priced chips to drive rivals out of
business.</TE>
<TE>   Because of brutal price competition, the field of competitors has
dwindled from more than a dozen players just 10 years ago. The drive
toward consolidation may not be over. Micron and Hynix earlier this
year agreed to merge their DRAM operations, but a disagreement among
Hynix board members nixed the deal in April.</TE>
<TE>   News of the investigation sent shares of memory chip companies
tumbling. Micron lost $3.52, nearly 15%, to $20.08 on the New York
Stock Exchange. Infineon dropped 4.8% on the Frankfurt exchange.
Samsung declined 4% and Hynix fell 13.4% in Seoul trading.</TE>

<HD>Dynegy Replaces CFO, Cuts 340 Jobs</HD>
<DH>Energy: Executive shuffle continues as company seeks to
restructure amid probe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Energy marketer and trader Dynegy Inc. laid off 6% of its workers and
replaced its chief financial officer Wednesday as part of an overhaul
designed to win back investors spooked by the Enron Corp. debacle.</LD>
<LD>   Dynegy said last week that it was laying off workers as part of a
restructuring plan, but did not announce the depth of the job cuts--
340 worldwide--until Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   About 300 of the affected employees work at Dynegy's Houston
headquarters.</LD>
<TE>   The layoffs came on the same day Dynegy replaced Chief Financial
Officer Rob Doty with Louis Dorey. Dorey most recently headed
Dynegy's bread-and-butter gas and power marketing business.</TE>
<TE>   Doty, 44, had worked for Dynegy for 10 years and had served as CFO
since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy said Dorey's ascendancy would help with the restructuring,
which the company plans to discuss during a Monday conference call.</TE>
<TE>   That plan probably will include asset sales, which Dynegy has been
talking about since January.</TE>
<TE>   Besides selling hard assets, including its profitable pipelines,
Dynegy could enter into joint ventures in which it would manage and
operate facilities for a partner, executives have said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Doty's exit was the tail end of an executive shuffle
that began with Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson's ouster
May 28.</TE>
<TE>   Watson resigned under board pressure in May, after the Securities
and Exchange Commission began investigating a natural gas deal
designed to reduce Dynegy's tax burden and a pair of "round-trip"
energy trades it undertook at a customer's request.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy shares closed down 99 cents, or 11%, at $7.71 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Rewarding a Music Career</HD>
<DH>Atlantic Records' Jason Flom gets to expand his own label,
Lava Records</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Ritchie's rap music career seemed to have peaked the night he
took the stage at Detroit's State Theatre. He'd been dropped from two
record labels, and though his local concerts sold armloads of
T-shirts, he was viewed by most music scouts as a knockoff of Vanilla
Ice, the white rapper who quickly faded in the 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   In the audience that night was Atlantic Records executive Jason
Flom, who found himself seduced by the rapper's self-possessed
persona. He called himself Kid Rock, and Flom signed him to a record
deal.</LD>
<LD>   "With Jason, I can't say what he saw exactly, but he saw that
thing that other people never did," Ritchie said. "He heard the songs
and he could see where it was going."</LD>
<TE>   Ritchie's first album, "Devil Without a Cause," has sold an
estimated 9 million copies. The album's success once again affirmed
Flom's reputation as a scout with platinum instincts. Flom has signed
more than a dozen top-selling acts during his two-decade career,
including Sugar Ray, Matchbox Twenty, Tori Amos, the Corrs, Skid Row
and Twisted Sister.</TE>
<TE>   Albums by two of those acts--Kid Rock and Matchbox Twenty--have
been certified as "diamond," selling 10 million units, a distinction
achieved by only about 90 albums in music history.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest records I've ever had," Flom said, "are the ones that
nobody else wanted."</TE>
<TE>   Flom was rewarded Wednesday with a dramatic expansion of Lava
Records, the small label he has run inside Atlantic since 1995.
Warner Music Group will pay Flom $50 million to buy the share of Lava
it doesn't already own and sign him to a new five-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   The payoff punctuates Flom's long ascent--and sometimes rocky
ride--in a business in which executives fade as fast as yesterday's
pop novelties. The 41-year-old executive has survived by consistently
predicting which acts will win mass consumer appeal, from hair-metal
bands to pop-rock singers, despite ever-shifting public tastes.</TE>
<TE>   Record companies rise or fall on the ears and eyes of their artist
and repertoire, or A&amp;R, scouts. Major labels receive hundreds of demo
CDs each week and keep track of dozens of unsigned bands receiving
radio airplay or selling self-released albums in their local markets.
Scouts prowl clubs and music festivals. From all that, each label can
sign only about 20 new acts a year.</TE>
<TE>   The wrong choice can mean millions of dollars wasted on radio
promotion, marketing and studio expenses. The right choice can mean
marketplace clout and personal enrichment.</TE>
<TE>   Flom signed Irish pop act The Corrs, for example, after they
showed up in the lobby of Time Warner's headquarters and asked for a
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured, they're here all the way from Ireland. But I was
expecting the worst....They marched into my office in full evening
regalia. They looked like they were ready to do a concert."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they played a tape that impressed Flom so much that he
signed them and put them on a Fleetwood Mac "tribute" album. The
Corrs' version of "Dreams" became an international hit. Since then,
the group has sold an estimated 25 million albums worldwide, becoming
one of Warner Music's biggest moneymakers.</TE>
<TE>   Even competitors acknowledge that Flom's success over such a long
period is virtually unmatched. "He instinctually understands what is
credible," said Universal Music Group Chairman Doug Morris, Flom's
former boss. "Not many people have that ability and it doesn't stay
with you for that long."</TE>
<TE>   Critics question whether his acts will be forgotten or have the
staying power of previous Atlantic superstars Led Zeppelin or AC/DC.
Last year, the label dropped two of Flom's signings, Amos and rock
band Collective Soul, after their new albums failed to meet
expectations. Kid Rock's latest album has sold just 1.6 million
copies--far less than his debut.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the attention span of the public is shorter than it used
to be," Flom said. "Obviously, everyone tries to find the next
Springsteen. Those are the rarest of the rare.</TE>
<TE>   "What I try to do is find great artists and help them realize
their goals, and do a good job of promoting them."</TE>
<TE>   Rock Star Dreams</TE>
<TE>   Flom got into the music business hoping to be a star himself. The
son of a prominent corporate-takeover attorney, he discovered music
as a teen, hooked on the funk arrangements of Sly &amp; the Family Stone
and the showmanship of KISS.</TE>
<TE>   While his father, Joseph, turned Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp;
Flom into a legal powerhouse, Jason wore his hair below his shoulders
and practiced guitar in a rented studio or--when his parents were
away--in the living room.</TE>
<TE>   After prep school, Flom told his father that he was going to
pursue his rock star dreams. His father said he would give him one
year before forcing him to enroll in college. When the younger Flom's
fantasies didn't materialize, his father called an attorney who
worked for Warner's then-chief, Steve Ross, landing his son on the
Warner Music payroll.</TE>
<TE>   "I showed up that first day and I had more hair than you can
imagine. I looked like Cousin Itt," he said, referring to the
hair-covered character in "The Addams Family." "They took one look at
me and said, 'You're going to Atlantic,' " a nod to the label's
rock-heavy roster.</TE>
<TE>   Flom entered the business as a field merchandising trainee,
meaning he was stuck hanging posters of Atlantic acts on record store
walls.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, he took an assignment to the label's sales research team.
Poring over radio playlists in a trade magazine, he latched onto
unknown bands picking up local airplay. On the phone with a
programmer at a Long Island rock station, he made his first
discovery, a hard rock band called Zebra. Flom had the band's demo
tape shipped to him by overnight mail.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Flom told Atlantic's talent division that he had
discovered the next Led Zeppelin. A label talent scout told him he
was wasting his time. Undeterred, Flom gave the tape to Atlantic's
president, Morris, who played it while commuting home. He decided to
sign the band. Zebra's first album sold a few hundred thousand
copies--much more than expected--and Flom was soon promoted to the
label's artist and repertoire division.</TE>
<TE>   One of his first signings was Twisted Sister, a New York rock act
considered a novelty by many label executives. In a club in
Poughkeepsie, Flom saw the potential for mass appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "There were 2,000 kids there and it was a Wednesday," Flom
recalled. "They were all wearing Twisted Sister T-shirts. That was a
good sign."</TE>
<TE>   The band's first album for Atlantic, "You Can't Stop Rock 'N'
Roll," sold about 100,000 copies, better than expected. The next
album went platinum.</TE>
<TE>   Stumbles in Life</TE>
<TE>   But as Flom's career soared, his personal life crashed: He had
become a drug addict and an alcoholic. As a result, he often didn't
show up at the office until noon.</TE>
<TE>   "It sort of fed on itself. The hits dried up because I got worse,
and I got worse because the hits dried up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Flom's boss, Morris, finally persuaded him to check into a
rehabilitation center for a month.</TE>
<TE>   When he returned to work, Flom said, "it was weird. I thought I
could stay sober, but I didn't think I'd have another hit"--until a
Minneapolis radio station began playing the music of rock band White
Lion, which Flom had signed several months before hitting bottom.
White Lion's album went on to sell about 2 million copies.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, he signed singer-songwriter Amos. Flom picked her demo
off a table piled with tapes because it was the only one wrapped in
church stationery.</TE>
<TE>   By 1992, he had become the head of the label's talent division,
which is credited with signing, among others, multi-platinum rockers
Stone Temple Pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Morris rewarded Flom by agreeing to finance his own label, Lava,
which survived a corporate bloodbath that soon erupted at Warner
Music and claimed Morris' position.</TE>
<TE>   Under Wednesday's deal, Lava will add about 35 employees and keep
Flom at Atlantic, whose management team has been the target of
repeated raid attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "We value Jason tremendously for his ability to spot talent, to
see where the market is going," Warner Music Group Chairman Roger
Ames said this week. "Obviously we have to make sure he's treated
right."</TE>
<TE>   Flom said he is not intimidated by the new pressures he faces.
"I'm not going to have any excuses if I fail, and I'm not going to
fail."</TE>

<HD>Jury Considers Genentech Penalty</HD>
<DH>Courts: City of Hope attorney asks panel 'to send a clear
message' to the biotech firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jurors began deliberations on punitive damages against Genentech Inc.
on Wednesday after closing arguments in which an attorney for City of
Hope National Medical Center asked for a penalty of between $300
million and $580 million.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Morgan Chu, tapping into public disgust with corporate
America, told jurors the amount would "send a clear message" to
Genentech and other California corporations that they must "play by
the rules."</LD>
<LD>   The jury last week ordered Genentech to pay compensatory damages
of $300.2 million for withholding royalties from City of Hope under a
1976 contract. Jurors also found Genentech violated a fiduciary duty
to the Duarte hospital and acted with malice or fraud, for which the
biotechnology company faces punitive damages.</LD>
<TE>   Susan Harriman, an attorney for South San Francisco-based
Genentech, said the company had been stung by the jury's findings and
pleaded with jurors not to impose additional penalties.</TE>
<TE>   "Please don't punish us," she said at least twice during her
argument.</TE>
<TE>   But Chu told jurors that an award of less than $300 million would
be little more than a "slap on the wrist" to Genentech, which, he
reminded them, has a net worth of $5.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The high end of the range proposed by Chu represents 10% of
Genentech's net worth.</TE>
<TE>   "You have an opportunity to strike a blow for justice," Chu told
the panel.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute involves a contract that led to the discovery that
launched the biotechnology age. With funding from Genentech, two City
of Hope scientists discovered a method of producing biotechnology
drugs from ordinary bacteria. City of Hope gave Genentech the patents
on the invention in exchange for a 2% royalty on sales of products
that stemmed from the discovery.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors found that Genentech licensed the patents to 22 companies
but hid the deals from City of Hope to avoid paying royalties on the
35 drugs produced by the third parties.</TE>
<TE>   Closing arguments took place after two key legal rulings forced
Genentech to scrap plans for its defense. The jury was not present
for the rulings.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Judge Edward Y. Kakita said he would not allow
testimony from Genentech on the minimal royalties it received on 12
third-party deals.</TE>
<TE>   Based on that ruling, Genentech did not call its damages expert to
counter testimony from City of Hope's expert, Michael Wagner.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner, the only witness for City of Hope, testified Tuesday that
Genentech, with $1 billion in cash and no debt, was strong enough to
pay a punitive damage award.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner told jurors he found support for his opinion in Genentech's
first-quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   In that document, the company said the outcome of the City of Hope
case would not have a "material adverse impact" on the company's
financial position.</TE>
<TE>   However, in a new document filed with the SEC on Wednesday, the
company said: "If punitive damages are awarded to the City of Hope,
such award could have a material adverse effect on ... the company's
financial position, current and future results of operations and cash
flows."</TE>
<TE>   In a second key ruling Wednesday, Kakita said Genentech could not
offer testimony about the reforms underway at the company as a result
of last week's verdict.</TE>
<TE>   In closing arguments for Genentech, Harriman urged jurors to
consider "what Genentech did right."</TE>
<TE>   She said the company paid City of Hope more than $305 million in
royalties on human insulin and human growth hormone, drugs not
involved in the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a case where one party completely stiffed the other
side," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Harriman told jurors that they were not obligated to award City of
Hope punitive damages. But she did suggest an alternate figure. She
said Genentech earned about $333 million in royalties on sales of the
35 disputed drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "If you award $33 million [in addition to the $300-million
compensatory award], you would have stripped Genentech of all it
earned ... every last penny," Harriman said. "That's a very harsh
punishment."</TE>

<HD>Home Prices, Sales Soar to New Highs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home prices and sales spiraled to record highs across much of the
Southland last month, leading to the best May for sellers in more
than a dozen years.</LD>
<LD>   The robust results reported Wednesday by DataQuick Information
Systems Inc. surprised some analysts who predicted the market would
cool. But the small inventory of available properties combined with
the incentive of falling mortgage rates coaxed buyers to pay the
highest prices for existing homes and condominiums since records were
kept in 1988.</LD>
<LD>   The median price--the point at which half the homes sell for more
and half for less--jumped nearly 18% in Los Angeles County from a
year earlier to a record $258,000. It was the sixth month in a row
that prices set a record, the longest streak since the last housing
boom more than a decade ago.</LD>
<TE>   In Orange County, which has the highest prices in Southern
California, the median also surged more than 16% from a year earlier,
to a record $346,000, DataQuick said.</TE>
<TE>   The report covered sales that closed in May, reflecting agreements
between home sellers and buyers over the last 30 to 60 days. Real
estate agents said steep price appreciation has cooled the pace of
sales recently and might be reflected in future reports. Some agents
are advising sellers to lower their asking prices, saying buyers are
growing a bit resistant to rapid price increases.</TE>
<TE>   "There was more of a frenzy earlier this year in February, March
and April," said Steve Celotto, a broker at Coldwell Banker in Laguna
Hills. "Right now, if you push prices beyond the highest comparative
home, it is taking a little longer to sell the house. So, the market
has calmed down a little but not drastically. The bottom line is:
It's still good."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said more consumers are turning to adjustable-rate
mortgages, which have a lower rate of interest and more lenient
credit criteria than fixed loans.</TE>
<TE>   Usage of those mortgages grew in May by more than a third from a
year earlier in Orange and Los Angeles counties, DataQuick said. At
Countrywide Home Loans, consumers applying for such loans have
tripled in the last couple of months, said Doug Perry, first vice
president at Countrywide.</TE>
<TE>   Perry said the loans, which carry interest rates in the mid-4%
range, draw consumers who want to boost their buying power. So-called
hybrid loans, which have fixed interest for three years before
converting to a rate that changes annually, have been particularly
popular, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, only about a fourth of the loans in Los Angeles and Orange
counties are being taken at adjustable rates. In previous market
cycles, more than 60% of buyers contracted for variable rate loans.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers applied for more home loans last week nationwide as
mortgage rates dipped to their lowest level since early November, the
Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America said in a separate report released
Wednesday. A 30-year fixed-rate loan averaged 6.53% last week, the
lowest level since early November.</TE>
<TE>   With rates falling, the U.S. mortgage industry is expected to post
its second-best year. Freddie Mac, a secondary mortgage investor,
predicts lenders to issue $1.7 trillion in home loans this year,
compared with a record $2.2 trillion a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The Southland also demonstrated persistent strength in sales
activity last month. Purchases surged nearly 30% to 5,091 in Orange
County and jumped nearly 15% to 11,508 in Los Angeles County. John
Karevoll, who compiled the report for DataQuick, said housing demand
would remain strong in coming months and probably for the rest of the
year if lending conditions continued to be favorable for buyers.</TE>

<LD>Home prices and sales spiraled to record highs across much of the
Southland last month, leading to the best May for sellers in more
than a dozen years.</LD>
<LD>   The robust results reported Wednesday by DataQuick Information
Systems Inc. surprised some analysts who predicted the market would
cool. But the small inventory of available properties combined with
the incentive of falling mortgage rates coaxed buyers to pay the
highest prices for existing homes and condominiums since records were
kept in 1988.</LD>
<LD>   The median price--the point at which half the homes sell for more
and half for less--jumped nearly 18% in Los Angeles County from a
year earlier to a record $258,000. It was the sixth month in a row
that prices set a record, the longest streak since the last housing
boom more than a decade ago.</LD>
<TE>   In Orange County, which has the highest prices in Southern
California, the median also surged more than 16% from a year earlier,
to a record $346,000, DataQuick said.</TE>
<TE>   The report covered sales that closed in May, reflecting agreements
between home sellers and buyers over the last 30 to 60 days. Real
estate agents said steep price appreciation has cooled the pace of
sales recently and might be reflected in future reports. Some agents
are advising sellers to lower their asking prices, saying buyers are
growing a bit resistant to rapid price increases.</TE>
<TE>   "There was more of a frenzy earlier this year in February, March
and April," said Steve Celotto, a broker at Coldwell Banker in Laguna
Hills.</TE>

<HD>SEC May Consider Action Against ImClone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ImClone Systems Inc. said Wednesday that federal regulators are
considering taking action against the troubled drug maker for failing
to accurately disclose information in December about an experimental
cancer drug.</LD>
<LD>   ImClone said it received a notice saying staff at the Securities
and Exchange Commission may recommend the SEC penalize the company
for disclosures it made, or did not make, to the public immediately
after learning that regulators had declined to accept its drug,
Erbitux, for review.</LD>
<LD>   Any action would be separate from initiatives taken by the SEC
against ImClone's former chief executive, Samuel D. Waksal, who was
arrested last week on charges of insider trading in the company's
stock.</LD>
<TE>   ImClone shares rose 3% to $11.41 on Nasdaq, but fell $1.41 in
after-hours trading on Instinet.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 28, the Food and Drug Administration told ImClone that it
would not consider reviewing the company's marketing application for
Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call with analysts and investors several days
later, ImClone said the agency's concerns were over how the company
documented its evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The company said that although an independent radiology group
tested patients in clinical trials and recorded improvements in their
condition, the FDA was dissatisfied with the documentation that
should have backed up the results.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't understand the importance of making sure we documented
the pathway of how the doctors reached their conclusions," Harlan W.
Waksal, ImClone's chief operating officer at the time, told
investors. Harlan, brother of Samuel, now is chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   It subsequently emerged--first through portions of the FDA's
letter to ImClone leaked to the Cancer Letter, an industry
newsletter, and most recently in a congressional hearing to determine
whether ImClone defrauded investors--that the FDA's concerns were
significantly deeper.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA, it now is clear, believed the trials themselves to be
flawed. A number of patients should not have been included in the
trial. Their presence may have distorted the results, the FDA said
last week at a public hearing in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The depth of the problems probably will cause a far longer delay
in Erbitux reaching the market than a simple problem of documentation
would have.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone can respond to issues raised in the SEC notice and said it
plans to cooperate fully.</TE>

<HD>Tech Woes Sink Stocks</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Dow drops 144 points and Nasdaq slides to a new
low for the year after warnings from Apple, AMD and Ciena.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Warnings from Apple Computer, Advanced Micro Devices and Ciena
sparked a technology sell-off Wednesday, sending the Nasdaq composite
index to a new low for the year as Wall Street grew more pessimistic
about the timing of a business turnaround. The Dow Jones industrials
tumbled more than 140 points.</LD>
<LD>   In other trading, Treasury bond yields plunged and the dollar
sank.</LD>
<LD>   The downward momentum in stocks was accelerated by the second
suicide bombing in Israel in as many days and an FBI warning to its
field offices about possible terrorist attacks on July 4. Analysts
said the reports gave investors already skeptical about
second-quarter earnings another reason to stay away.</LD>
<TE>   "We've got a boatload of bad news, and more rumblings in the
Middle East have investors very nervous," said Tom Schrader, head of
listed trading for Legg Mason Wood Walker. "On top of that, the FBI
said there's a potential for an attack on July 4. It's a cornucopia
of bad news."</TE>
<TE>   The Dow closed down 144.55 points, or 1.5%, at 9,561.57, wiping
out more than half of its 231-point gain from the first two days of
the week. It was the Dow's fifth triple-digit move in seven sessions.
The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index dropped 17.15 points, or
1.7%, to 1,019.99.</TE>
<TE>   The worst damage was in the tech sector. The Nasdaq composite
index slid 46.13 points, or 3%, to 1,496.83, with losing stocks
outnumbering winners by almost 2 to 1. The last time Nasdaq closed
lower was Oct. 2, when it stood at 1,492.33. The index had closed as
low as 1,496.86 last week before staging a rebound.</TE>
<TE>   About five stocks fell for every three that rose on the New York
Stock Exchange, as trading volume rose.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Treasury yields had their biggest drop in four months
on expectations the Federal Reserve will wait until at least the
fourth quarter to raise interest rates, on worries that the economic
recovery is slowing.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds also benefited from a "flight to safety" by jittery
investors. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell from
4.84% Tuesday to 4.73%--the lowest since Dec. 4.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar fell to a 17-month low of 95.7 cents against the euro.
A slowing economic recovery would reduce the allure of U.S. assets
for foreign investors. A decline past 95.94 cents would take the
dollar to its cheapest point since July 2000. The greenback also
touched a two-week low against the yen.</TE>
<TE>   On Wall Street, Apple tumbled $3.03, or 15%, to $17.12 after
saying revenue and profit would be lower than predicted because of
soft demand for its products. A similar warning, as well as
prediction of a substantial operating loss, sent chip maker AMD down
$1.60, or 15.5%, to $8.70. AMD rival Intel dropped $1.93 to $20.09 on
word it was shuttering its Web-hosting service and would take a
$100-million charge in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Semiconductor makers also were hurt by news of an antitrust probe
into the $11.9-billion memory-chip market. The SOX index of chip
stocks fell 6.7%--back to its lows of early October--as all 17 of its
members fell.</TE>
<TE>   In other tech woes, software maker Oracle fell 18 cents to $8.80
after reporting quarterly results in line with expectations, but
reducing its outlook for the current quarter because of weak
corporate spending. And Ciena fell 44 cents to $3.96 after the
company said lower third-quarter revenue was possible because of the
difficult telecom environment.</TE>
<TE>   Among brokerage stocks, Morgan Stanley fell $1.05 to $44.15 after
reporting that second-quarter profit dropped 14%, hurt by a slump in
energy trading. Bear Stearns slid 26 cents to $61.69 even as the firm
said earnings rose 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Some stocks benefited from a Commerce Department report Tuesday
showing a bigger-than-expected 11.6% increase in housing construction
in May, the largest gain since July 1995. Home Depot added 5 cents to
$37.65 and lumber giant Weyerhaeuser rose 26 cents to $65.</TE>
<TE>   Also, trucking company Yellow, up $2.06 to $31.05, and Goodyear
Tire, down 16 cents to $19.84, issued improved profit outlooks.</TE>
<TE>   TRW rose 27 cents to $55.97 on word it was selling its
aeronautical systems businesses to Goodrich for $1.5 billion.
Goodrich lost 33 cents to $28.98. Northrop Grumman, which has been
trying to buy TRW for four months, rose $2.80 to $132.50.</TE>

<HD>Pemex Aims to Woo Gas Investment</HD>
<DH>Mexico: A plan to allow foreign companies to operate
production projects faces opposition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Mexico unveiled its plan Wednesday to attract as much as $8 billion
in foreign investment to boost production of natural gas, a fuel in
which the nation faces a growing shortfall in coming years. But the
investment vehicle called "multiple services contracts" faces
opposition in the Mexican legislature and possibly in Mexican courts.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico's constitution prohibits foreign companies from owning,
developing and otherwise controlling energy resources and
installations. The new service contracts are an attempt to attract
foreign capital without giving up government ownership.</LD>
<LD>   Whether it will succeed is unclear. Last month, President Vicente
Fox's effort to give private electricity generators greater access to
the nationwide power grid was struck down by the Mexican Supreme
Court as unconstitutional.</LD>
<TE>   Pemex, the state-owned oil company, has signed short-term
contracts with firms for services such as drilling and seismic
studies. The new plan would greatly expand on such contracts to allow
outside companies to operate gas production projects for up to 20
years.</TE>
<TE>   Fox and Pemex officials insist that the new contracts, which are
to be put out to bid in November, skirt the constitutional
prohibitions by assuring that Pemex retains ownership of the gas.
Contractors would be paid according to how efficiently they produce
gas.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, including members of the minority Democratic
Revolutionary Party, say the contracts should be barred because they
give foreign companies effective control of production facilities as
well as intimate knowledge of geological conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The contracts would ease but not eliminate Mexico's looming
natural gas shortfall, said Luis Ramirez Corzo, Pemex's director of
exploration and production. Without the contracts and the 1 billion
cubic feet of gas they would generate daily, the cost of importing
gas will rise to $2 billion in 2006 from $270 million last year, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some international oil firms don't like the multiple-services-
contract concept because the firms do not own the resource. They
cannot book gas reserves on their balance sheets as assets, which are
used by companies as collateral and by Wall Street analysts to
determine stock values.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Pemex officials said Wednesday that 75 major companies,
including Schlumberger Ltd., ChevronTexaco Corp. and Petrobras of
Brazil have expressed preliminary interest in bidding on the
contracts. Dozens of firms are expected to attend a conference here
today at which Pemex will lay out the details of the new contracts.</TE>
<TE>   With gas consumption in Mexico racing ahead of supply, Pemex has
no choice but to use foreign capital to develop new sources of the
fuel if it is to avoid the steep costs associated with mounting
imports.</TE>
<TE>   By 2010, Mexican gas consumption will more than double from the
daily average of 3.9 billion cubic feet, Ramirez Corzo said.</TE>
<TE>   Pemex hopes to award half a dozen contracts giving companies the
right to explore and produce gas in the potentially rich Burgos Basin
in Northern Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The Fox administration maintains that Pemex has the right to go
ahead with the bidding on multiple services contracts without
approval in congress, where Fox's National Action Party lacks a
majority.</TE>

<HD>'Windtalkers' Blows Ill for MGM as Firm Warns of Much
Steeper Losses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MGM Inc. on Wednesday warned Wall Street of much steeper losses than
expected for the latest quarter and full year, days after its current
movie "Windtalkers" became the latest in a string of box-office
flops.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Monica-based film studio now expects its second-quarter
loss to widen to 46 cents to 48 cents a share from a loss of 26 cents
a share a year earlier. Analysts were expecting a 13-cent loss, on
average, according to Thomson First Call.</LD>
<LD>   Given the lack of popularity of "Windtalkers," MGM nearly doubled
its projected loss for the year to a range of 85 cents to 89 cents.</LD>
<TE>   "Windtalkers," a World War II epic that was to be MGM's major
summer movie, debuted Friday to a paltry $14 million at domestic box
offices and landed in the No. 3 spot, crushed by "Scooby-Doo" and
"The Bourne Identity." It cost an estimated $115 million to $120
million to make.</TE>
<TE>   Two box-office bombs last winter, "Rollerball" and "Hart's War,"
led to a first-quarter loss of 37 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   MGM, whose controlling shareholder is Kirk Kerkorian, has only one
more major movie debut this year--the 20th James Bond film, "Die
Another Day," set for release in November.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, MGM continues to exploit its 4,000-title film library
to crank out home videos and DVDs, a business that has become a
profit generator. The company has said it expects those factors to
help it turn around.</TE>
<TE>   "We remain on track to return to profitability in the fourth
quarter of this year," Chief Financial Officer Dan Taylor said
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Hollywood's other major movie studios, MGM lacks large
media outlets such as TV networks, radio stations, cable TV systems
and theme parks to help offset the costs of producing and marketing
movies.</TE>
<TE>   So one movie flop can deal a severe blow to earnings.</TE>
<TE>   MGM shares fell 35 cents to close at $13.75 on the New York Stock
Exchange, before the news was announced.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Says No to Further Concessions</HD>
<DH>Antitrust: Firm ignores judge's request to provide penalty
proposals. States play down 'modular' solution in closing argument.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a defiant end to the biggest antitrust case in a century,
Microsoft Corp. lawyers Wednesday ignored a federal judge's request
that they submit a list of possible concessions to the nine states
suing the company for antitrust violations, saying the proposed
settlement with the Justice Department is as far as the software
giant is willing to go.</LD>
<LD>   Legal experts viewed the request as an indication that U.S.
District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who seemed to side with
Microsoft during much of the trial, was pressuring the company to
reconsider its penalty proposals. But during closing arguments,
Microsoft lead lawyer John Warden refused to make any concessions.</LD>
<LD>   "This proposed decree is fundamentally flawed ... punitive and
draconian," Warden said of the states' penalties. "We can't remedy
any of this by changing a few words here and there." Later in the
day, Warden--who also ignored Kollar-Kotelly's request that Microsoft
and the states consider how the proposed settlement might be
improved--sarcastically offered to eliminate some extra penalties
that Microsoft agreed to during negotiations that led to a settlement
accord with the Justice Department in November.</LD>
<TE>   For their part, the states said their top priority was to force
Microsoft to share more of its computer software code with rival
developers so that competitors could make their product work better
with Windows.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Kollar-Kotelly ordered both sides to "prioritize the
various provisions in your own remedy proposal" rather than argue
about the differences in their proposed antitrust penalties.</TE>
<TE>   The states, which during the trial repeatedly pressed Microsoft to
produce a "modular" version of Windows in which key software such as
Web browsers could be replaced with products produced by rivals,
de-emphasized that proposal during oral argument Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The states also did not mention a previous proposal to require
that Microsoft offer uniform pricing to computer makers. That
provision went unmentioned even though state trial lawyer Steven
Kuney noted that rewarding allies with price discounts and
threatening rivals were "part of the fabric of how they [Microsoft]
do business."</TE>
<TE>   Kuney went on to describe Microsoft as an illegal monopolist. And
he described company Chairman Bill Gates as arrogant, saying
Microsoft executives appear to think "they know better than anyone
else what's best for this PC ecosystem."</TE>
<TE>   Warden took issue with the characterizations: "We haven't failed
to get [the] message. We haven't claimed that we're immune from the
law or anything of that kind."</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly, who formally took the antitrust case under
advisement Wednesday evening after more than six hours of oral
argument, must decide whether to adopt all or part of the states'
tough remedies against Microsoft for breaking antitrust law. She also
must weigh whether a less onerous federal settlement Microsoft
reached with the Justice Department is in the public interest.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly is expected to issue a final ruling this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Four years after the landmark case began, some experts believe the
outcome probably will not be as earth-shattering as when the case
first began and a breakup of Microsoft was on the table.</TE>
<TE>   "The possibility of really shaking up the industry has seriously
diminished," said Andrew Gavil, an antitrust expert and professor of
law at Howard University in Washington. Kollar-Kotelly's decision, he
predicted, "will be magnitudes below a breakup ... although it will
still have significant consequences" for the technology industry.</TE>
<TE>   A federal appeals court last year found that Microsoft, whose
flagship Windows software runs more than 90% of all personal
computers, used its software dominance to illegally muscle out
competitors. But the District of Columbia, California and eight other
states broke ranks with the federal government and pursued stronger
antitrust sanctions against Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   The holdout states told Kollar-Kotelly on Wednesday that the
Justice Department's settlement with Microsoft lacked teeth. They
alleged that Microsoft has yet to alter its anti-competitive business
practices, and that the current court case might be the government's
last opportunity to restore competition in the market for computer
operating systems.</TE>
<TE>   "I suggest to you that Microsoft still doesn't get it, and you're
the only one left to tell them what it's all about," said the states'
lead trial attorney, Brendan V. Sullivan.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts said Wednesday that an outpouring of public and
expert sentiment against the Microsoft settlement with the Justice
Department appears to have swayed Kollar-Kotelly at the eleventh
hour.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 30,000 public comments submitted to the court this spring
in connection with the antitrust case, 7,500 supported Microsoft. And
this month, a bipartisan group of six leading former government
economists filed a brief urging Kollar-Kotelly to impose tough
penalties on Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the judge was persuaded by the economists," said Rob
Enderle, a senior technology analyst for Giga Information Group in
Santa Clara. "Her decision is not going to be a rubber stamp of the
[Microsoft-Justice Department] settlement agreement," Enderle said.
"She is looking for a remedy that goes further."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the original jurist in the antitrust case, U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, ordered Microsoft broken up
into two. A federal appeals court upheld many of the violations but
overturned Jackson's breakup order and appointed Kollar-Kotelly to
determine a new punishment.</TE>

<LD>Parker Hannifin Corp., the largest maker of hydraulic equipment, will
eliminate about 1,000 jobs, close six factories and write down some
acquisitions because of falling sales to makers of chip and
telecommunications devices.</LD>
<LD>   The 84-year-old company will have fiscal fourth-quarter expenses
of about $50 million, or 42 cents a share, for the three moves.</LD>
<LD>   Parker Hannifin acquired 60 companies in the last 10 years,
including makers of factory equipment used by computer and
communications customers.</LD>
<TE>   Cleveland-based Parker Hannifin will take a write-down of $37
million in its fourth quarter for a decline in the value of some of
those acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the company, which had fiscal 2001 sales of about $6
billion and almost 45,000 employees, rose 44 cents to $47.27 on the

<LD>Mexico is seeking to raise as much as $1 billion by selling a stake
in Grupo Financiero BBVA Bancomer, the nation's biggest bank.</LD>
<LD>   The sale, the second in a month involving state assets, is aimed
at helping the government limit its year-end budget deficit to no
more than 0.65% of gross domestic product without having to keep
reducing spending, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   The government planned to close its sale Wednesday of 12% of
Bancomer in a private placement targeting Mexican, U.S. and European
investment funds, investors said.</LD>

<LD>U.S. exports to Saudi Arabia, its largest market in the Arab world,
may fall by a third this year because of a boycott of American goods
and an economic slowdown in the kingdom.</LD>
<LD>   Exports may decline to $4 billion this year from $6 billion in
2001 as Saudis are shunning products from the U.S. because of its
support for Israel and trimming their spending as economic growth
eases, said Charles Kestenbaum, the U.S. Embassy's commercial
counselor.</LD>

<LD>Morgan Stanley's profit dropped 14% in the second quarter, hurt by a
slump in energy trading. Earnings at Bear Stearns Cos. more than
doubled, boosted by profit from its bond business.</LD>
<LD>   Net income at Morgan Stanley fell to $797 million, or 72 cents a
share, matching analyst estimates. Bear Stearns' net income rose to
$342.9 million, or $2.59 a share. Excluding a gain from an
investment, profit was $203 million, or $1.55 a share, 35 cents
better than estimates.</LD>
<LD>   The profit decline at Morgan Stanley suggests a recovery for the
securities industry may not come as fast as some analysts predicted.</LD>
<TE>   Net revenue at Morgan Stanley fell 17% to $4.97 billion. Net
revenue at Bear Stearns rose 17% to $1.6 billion.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Google Inc. is asking a federal judge to invalidate a patent owned by
rival Overture Services Inc. that lets businesses, for a fee, have
Web sites listed in the results of Internet queries.</LD>
<LD>   Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., denies that it infringes
the Overture patent. In court papers responding to Overture's
patent-infringement lawsuit in San Francisco, Google also challenges
the validity of a patent issued to Pasadena-based Overture under its
former name, GoTo.com</LD>
<LD>   Closely held Google said GoTo.com operated a system described in
the patent more than a year before the application was filed with the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in May 1999. Under U.S. patent law,
that may be the basis for invalidating the patent if Google proves
its allegations.</LD>
<TE>   The two companies are battling for clients such as AOL Time Warner
Inc.'s America Online, Yahoo Inc., EarthLink Inc. and Microsoft
Corp.'s MSN Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Overture shares rose 60 cents to $23.65 on Nasdaq. They've risen
17% in the last year.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lennar Corp., the second-largest U.S. home builder by revenue, said
that fiscal second-quarter profit rose 9.3% and that it raised its
forecast as low mortgage rates and acquisitions of other builders
spurred sales.</LD>
<LD>   Net income for the three months ended May 31 rose to $106 million,
or $1.51 a share. Lennar was expected to earn $1.24 a share,
according to a survey of analysts by Thomson First Call. Revenue
increased 14% to $1.6 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Miami-based Lennar boosted its 2003 profit target to $7.50 to $8 a
share, from $7 to $7.50.</LD>
<TE>   Lennar's outlook shows home builders are continuing to benefit
from mortgage rates that have averaged below 7% since late 2000, the
longest stretch at that level in at least three decades. The results
led to a rise in home builders' shares.</TE>
<TE>   Lennar shares rose $1.88 to $59.18 on the NYSE. The shares have
risen 27% this year.</TE>

<LD>Japan's trade surplus surged 715% in May from the same month last
year--nearly double market forecasts--amid a sharp increase in
exports of cars, computer chips and other high-tech products, mainly
to Asia.</LD>
<LD>   The country's merchandise trade surplus--the measure of all goods
exported minus those imported--totaled $4.99 billion, the Finance
Ministry said. The monthly increase, the third in a row, provides
more evidence that stronger external demand is helping to support
Japan's export-dependent manufacturing sector.</LD>
<LD>   Exports rose 8.8%, the second straight increase after 13
consecutive months of decline. Shipments to other Asian nations
jumped 15%, led by a 26.2% increase to China. Exports to the United
States, Japan's biggest trading partner, rose 5.5%.</LD>
<TE>   Tokyo's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States
rose 33.7% to $4.19 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Imports overall declined 5.6%, falling for the 10th straight
month.</TE>

<LD>In an unusual bid to spur CD sales, the hit British band Oasis is
using copy-protected discs to let consumers sample three songs from
its forthcoming album.</LD>
<LD>   The band plans to distribute 1.7 million discs free this weekend
as part of the Sunday Times newspaper.</LD>
<LD>   Using digital-rights-management technology from IBM Corp., the
disc includes three songs that can be played four times each on a
computer for a limited time.</LD>
<TE>   One goal is to introduce consumers to copy protection, which can
protect artists against online piracy, said Steven McMillan of Spero
Communications, the marketer that arranged the promotion.</TE>

<HD>Webby Awards Low-Key but Still Unconventional</HD>
<DH>Internet: The tech meltdown leads to drop in frills, people
at event honoring online's best.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>If last year's Webby Awards ceremony honoring the best of the Net had
all the hallmarks of denial--Hollywood guest stars and glitz sold out
the 3,100-seat Opera House--Tuesday night's sixth annual celebration
felt a lot like acceptance.</LD>
<LD>   Two years into the dot-com meltdown, only 600 people turned up for
a drastically scaled-back affair with no emcee and no multi- media
introductions, and some of those in the audience were asked to
participate by reading the names of nominees and winners.</LD>
<LD>   The result was an event that felt more like a New England town
meeting than a hip version of the Oscars.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not about technology. It's about people connecting," said
event founder Tiffany Shlain. "It's the Webbys unplugged."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone could afford to connect in person. Some nominees
didn't attend, for lack of air fare.</TE>
<TE>   But the only-in-San Francisco ceremony still brought out the
wackiness of Web-heads dressed as butterflies or dominatrixes and the
traditional five-word acceptance speeches.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd's favorite speech came from Tim Harrod of humor site the
Onion, who hefted the odd metallic coil that is the Webby trophy and
said: "Airport security should love this."</TE>
<TE>   The event also showcased a once-highflying spirit that has morphed
into grim determination. Web pioneers argued that just as the medium
had been over-hyped in the short term, it is being under-hyped in the
long term.</TE>
<TE>   "The silver lining of the overestimation of the last several years
is that it brought 500 million people online, and they haven't left,"
Shlain told the audience at the California Palace of the Legion of
Honor, an out-of-the-way museum in a little-trafficked urban park.
"Now, instead of thinking big, let's think long."</TE>
<TE>   Others echoed that sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to connect every mind on this planet, and I think
we'll do that," said John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   But Barlow said that with the humility he gained during the
dot-com collapse, "I don't talk about people who don't see it that
way as being clueless."</TE>
<TE>   The Webby Awards came into being before the big boom and always
recognized not just dot-coms but also dot-orgs, dot-edus and
dot-govs: It was never about which company had the biggest initial
public stock offering.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the winners chosen by expert panels in more than 30
categories ranged from Internet giants Amazon.com and Yahoo to
www.freelori.org, a Web site run by the Committee to Free Lori
Berenson, an American woman imprisoned in Peru, and Tolerance .org,
run by the Southern Pov- erty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Tolerance.org producer Ashley Day, who joined the education and
activism site after working at two New York start-ups, doesn't miss
the money chase of the old days.</TE>
<TE>   "We hear from people every day about how our material has changed
their lives," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Search engine Google, which won for "best practices," came late to
the Internet dance and missed a window to sell shares to the public.
In some ways, said co-founder Larry Page, that's been a blessing.</TE>
<TE>   "We got to learn from other companies," said Page, speaking as
seriously as one could while wearing silky soccer shorts in honor of
the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Even Page toned it down for this year's affair. In 2001, he
accepted Google's award on in-line skates.</TE>

<HD>Pitt's Oversight Board May Ask for Accountants' Help</HD>
<DH>Regulation: The SEC will vote today on the chairman's
proposal to set tougher ethical standards for auditors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt's proposed
accounting oversight board could get help setting ethical standards
from the industry's chief lobbying group, commission officials said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Robert E. Burns, chief counsel in the SEC's Office of the Chief
Accountant, said the Public Accountability Board that Pitt envisions
might initially look to the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants to assist in setting standards for independence, ethics
and quality of auditors.</LD>
<LD>   After a start-up period, the board might establish its own
standards, Burns said.</LD>
<TE>   "This is going to be an organization set up in the private sector
by the private sector," Burns said in a briefing for reporters about
Pitt's proposal, which is slated for an SEC vote today.</TE>
<TE>   The institute is a lobbying arm for the accounting industry and
has been responsible for disciplining auditors.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt surprised critics this week by proposing an industry
oversight board with tougher enforcement powers than he envisioned.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the Senate Banking Committee approved a bill that
would create an accounting oversight board with duties and powers
that largely mirror Pitt's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC plan, which will be put out for public comment after
today's vote, worries critics of the accounting industry who fear
that a new board could be heavily influenced--and weakened--by the
profession.</TE>
<TE>   Investor confidence in accounting has eroded amid a flurry of
scandals involving corporate misreporting of financial results. Last
week, Enron Corp.'s auditor, Arthur Andersen, was convicted of
obstructing a federal investigation of Enron.</TE>
<TE>   The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants said
Tuesday that both Pitt's proposal and the Senate proposal "raise
uncertainties about whether auditing professionals will continue to
remain actively engaged in setting auditing standards."</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said
he hoped to bring the Senate accounting proposal to a floor vote in
July, though he warned that it could be delayed until September.</TE>
<TE>   Briefly</TE>
<TE>   Well-known stock fund manager Bill Miller on Wednesday offered a
new proposal to end the controversy over heavy corporate issuance of
stock options to employees: Halt all such issuance.</TE>
<TE>   "I support the banning of stock options, because anything that can
be accomplished with options can be accomplished by giving stock
directly," Miller, of Legg Mason Inc., said.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate critics say stock options are a hidden expense that
companies should be forced to deduct from earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Most firms don't do so, and many executives have lobbied against
proposals to force the expensing of options.</TE>

<HD>Judge Dismisses Arson Case Against Firefighter</HD>
<DH>Court: Fire Department spokesman had been accused of
torching a Pasadena house.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge dismissed an arson case Wednesday against a Los Angeles
County Fire Department spokesman accused of setting fire to an
unoccupied house he had tried to buy.</LD>
<LD>   After a two-day preliminary hearing, Pasadena Superior Court Judge
Teri Schwartz ruled that prosecutors had presented insufficient
evidence that Roland Lee Sprewell, 37, had started the fire in the
Pasadena house.</LD>
<LD>   Sprewell and his wife, Heidi, 36, were charged with a single
felony count of arson each after being arrested last February by the
San Gabriel Valley Arson Explosives Task Force.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office dropped the
charge against Heidi Sprewell in April.</TE>
<TE>   A Fire Department spokesman regularly quoted in news reports,
Roland Sprewell held a news conference of a different sort
Wednesday--one detailing what he called "a four-month nightmare."</TE>
<TE>   "I am overwhelmed," Sprewell said. "I had charges of arson leveled
against me because I was involved in a business transaction. It was
hell."</TE>
<TE>   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office,
said the office would review the charges before deciding whether to
refile the case.</TE>
<TE>   Sprewell's attorney, Vicki Podberesky, said the case was based on
weak circumstantial evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The house was vacant last July when the fire occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The Sprewells had tried to buy it, but the escrow had bogged down
because of an IRS lien against the house. When the Sprewells tried to
get their deposit back, the bank refused.</TE>
<TE>   When the fire broke out, Sprewell went to the scene. He told
several firefighters that he was in escrow on the house, and that he
had warned the sellers that vacant houses were at risk of vandalism
and arson.</TE>
<TE>   He also had proposed during a meeting with the owners that they
rent the house to him during escrow so he could protect it.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on 16 years of experience as a firefighter, [I said] it was
my belief that a vacant house was a fire risk," Sprewell reiterated
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   When investigators determined that the cause of the house fire had
been arson, Sprewell and his wife became suspects.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution's case, Podberesky said, had been based on
Sprewell's warnings to the sellers and his statements to firefighters
at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   But the judge, she said, "thought those statements were more
indicative of innocence than of guilt."</TE>
<TE>   A Fire Department spokesman, Armando Carillo, said he expected
Sprewell, who has been on administrative leave, to return to regular
duty soon.</TE>
<TE>   Sprewell said the stigma of the the charges had "turned me into a
pariah."</TE>
<TE>   He thanked those who had supported him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ready to go back to work," he said.</TE>

<HD>School Bond Is Tougher Sell Now</HD>
<DH>Ballot: The $3.3-billion measure must contend with
controversial secession proposals and questions on how the 1997 issue
was spent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second time in five years, the Los Angeles Unified School
District is seeking voter approval for a massive school construction
bond issue to relieve campus overcrowding.</LD>
<LD>   But the district's plan to place a $3.3-billion measure on the
November ballot is facing a much tougher political climate than
prevailed the last time voters passed a school bond issue, officials
say.</LD>
<LD>   Municipal secession is threatening to split Los Angeles apart, and
some San Fernando Valley separatists oppose the measure. Moreover,
the school district faces enormous skepticism about how it handled
proceeds from its previous bond issue, a $2.4-billion measure
approved by voters in 1997.</LD>
<TE>   District officials say the new bond money is needed to keep up
with soaring enrollments, end mandatory busing and get already
crowded schools off the worst year-round calendars.</TE>
<TE>   Together with the 1997 funds, proceeds are expected to pay for 115
new schools and repair hundreds of other aging campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "This city cannot survive without this solution," said Supt. Roy
Romer, who has asked actor Arnold Schwarzenegger and other
celebrities to help promote the district's message through public
appearances or giving money. "There is no Plan B."</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified is gearing up for a multimillion-dollar publicity
blitz to tout district successes and highlight the need for the bond
issue. The measure must receive a 55% vote to pass. The previous
ballot item, Proposition BB, passed five years ago with 71%. This
time, the district must convince skeptical voters that it can do the
job responsibly in the aftermath of disclosures that it mismanaged
money for school repairs from Proposition BB. Public anger lingers
too over how the district handled environmental problems at the
Belmont Learning Complex near downtown.</TE>
<TE>   The measure, scheduled to be approved next month by the Board of
Education, will appear on the same ballot as a mammoth state school
bond issue and the proposals for San Fernando Valley and Hollywood
secession.</TE>
<TE>   Secession would not affect the district's boundaries, which are
different from those of the city of Los Angeles and include several
other cities and unincorporated areas.</TE>
<TE>   But leaders of the breakaway effort are promoting a new Valley
city as the first step toward creating a separate Valley school
system--a district that they say would be more accountable to
parents.</TE>
<TE>   A key leader of the Valley secession movement says he will
encourage voters to reject L.A. Unified's bond issue, partly because
of the problems with the last one.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that putting this on the ballot is a wrong move in the
midst of this tremendous grass-roots movement of Valley identity,"
said Valley VOTE Chairman Richard Close. "I recognize the need for
the facilities, but the timing is just wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the dissent is fueled by distrust over how the school
district handled spending for Proposition BB and the Belmont Learning
Complex. That will be the costliest high school in California, with a
price tag exceeding $260 million after an extended work stoppage and
upcoming repairs to deal with dangerous gases at the site, part of
which is a former oil field.</TE>
<TE>   Romer disclosed last fall that the district faces a shortfall of
as much as $600 million for repairs that Proposition BB originally
was supposed to cover--the result of increasing costs, contractual
disputes and poor oversight. Proposition BB, however, did launch
several dozen new schools.</TE>
<TE>   The district has finished half of about 12,000 repair and
modernization jobs planned under Proposition BB and must now find
money for the rest. Romer said the money will come not from the new
bond issue but from developer fees, interest payments and other
sources.</TE>
<TE>   "People understand there is nothing like the value of a good
education. The question is, can LAUSD deliver?" said former
Assemblyman Richard Katz, a leader in the San Fernando Valley
cityhood effort, who chaired the Proposition BB campaign five years
ago. "Can they overcome all their lost opportunities, all the
promises that were not met? That's Romer's challenge--to convince the
public that their money will be well spent."</TE>
<TE>   District officials say they have now assembled a top-notch school
facilities team that is up to the task. That team includes Jim
McConnell, a former Navy Seabee; Kathi Littman, a construction
management expert; and Tim Buresh, a highly regarded engineer who
helped guide the $2.4-billion Alameda Corridor rail project.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say they will develop detailed plans to set forth the
scope of work and the costs and schedules of each project.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the school district is expanding the powers of a
citizens committee to oversee Proposition BB and the new bond issue.
The panel, with its own independent consultant and attorney, will
issue monthly progress reports and early warnings when projects are
likely to exceed budgeted costs.</TE>
<TE>   District officials say that these measures go well beyond the
oversight required by state law.</TE>
<TE>   "The credibility of the organization to perform is what's at stake
here," Romer said. "This is a different LAUSD than [the one of five
years ago]. We now have the capacity to build this very large project
on time and within budget."</TE>
<TE>   District leaders have already won over one former critic.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Robert Garcia, who heads the Proposition BB citizens
committee, praised the district for "unprecedented cooperation" in
sharing information about construction and repair progress, a big
change from the secrecy he and others decried in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "I have confidence that the new facilities team will build and
repair schools wisely and efficiently, as the voters of Los Angeles
intend," Garcia told the school board this week.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified's space crisis has been caused by steady enrollment
growth and a failure to build enough schools. As a result, more than
17,000 students now ride buses from their crowded neighborhoods, some
to campuses an hour away. And nearly half of the district's 736,000
students attend schools year-round on staggered tracks that run 163
days--17 fewer than the school years at campuses on traditional
calendars.</TE>
<TE>   District officials say the new bond issue would help alleviate
these problems, adding more than 112,000 classroom seats by 2006.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley, which accounts for 30% of the district's enrollment,
would get 25% of the new seats; it would get additional classroom
space as students bused to its schools returned to their own
neighborhoods, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The district's plans will depend on a $13-billion state bond
issue, also on the November ballot, that will provide necessary
matching funds. If either the state or local measure fails, the
district's plans will be thrown into disarray, officials warn.</TE>
<TE>   "We will literally have kids with no place to sit, and that is an
untenable position for our community," said the school board
president, Caprice Young.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Unified bond measure would set aside $1.6 billion
to complete 80 schools and 79 campus additions or playground
expansions that were partly funded by Proposition BB.</TE>
<TE>   An additional $1 billion would be used to build 35 more schools.
These extra seats would allow the district to end mandatory busing
and return all students to the 180-day calendars, the statewide
standard--though most of these campuses would still have to operate
on year-round schedules.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from construction, the bond issue would devote $606 million
to repair and modernize schools--replacing fire and burglar alarms,
painting buildings and upgrading phone switches so 911 calls could be
placed from classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Lesser amounts would be allocated to build more charter schools,
expand early childhood centers, stock new campuses with library books
and develop joint-use projects with other public agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Young and Romer kicked off a fund-raising drive this week with an
exclusive gathering of about 40 business and civic leaders at the
private California Club downtown. In between crab cakes and wine,
Romer solicited donations, telling guests that the district needs to
raise $2 million for a successful bond campaign. He said the district
had secured between $300,000 and $500,000 in pledges, with
philanthropist Eli Broad and Disney chief Michael Eisner both
indicating support.</TE>
<TE>   Broad has given the district $100,000 to publicize its rising test
scores and other successes, a district spokeswoman said.</TE>

<HD>Ghost Town Bill May Leave Calico in the Dust</HD>
<DH>History: Measure that would give remote Bodie the official
title is spurring a rivalry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They are dusty remnants of California's Gold Rush past, two little
ghost towns, 300 miles apart.</LD>
<LD>   One is Bodie, a wind-swept blip in the sage-covered emptiness of
Mono County. The other is Calico, a sunbaked outpost near Barstow.
They have coexisted in harmony--until now.</LD>
<LD>   A bill before the Senate today aims to make Bodie the official
ghost town of California. Not surprisingly, folks partial to Calico
are a tad riled up.</LD>
<TE>   "Why Bodie?" harrumphed John Major, who runs a rock shop in
Calico. "They've got some nice old buildings there, but Calico is a
much more authentic representation of a ghost town."</TE>
<TE>   Not so, retorts the bill's author, Assemblyman Tim Leslie (R-Tahoe
City). Calico, he says, offers the "shooting gallery and snow cone
ghost town experience." But for the real deal? "You've got to go to
Bodie."</TE>
<TE>   With a nearly $24-billion budget deficit and other weighty woes
plaguing the state, the ghost town rivalry has not sparked a huge
ruckus in the Capitol. Despite the inevitable quips about Leslie's
bill not having a "ghost of a chance," it has glided through the
Legislature and will probably wind up on Gov. Gray Davis' desk.</TE>
<TE>   But among ghost town aficionados and other admirers of the Old
West, the move to single out Bodie for special status is big news. To
some, it's a matter of historical purity (Bodie) versus high-octane
visitor experience (Calico).</TE>
<TE>   Bodie exists in a raw state of utter abandonment, preserved
precisely as is by crews who mend roofs and prop up sagging
buildings, but do little more. A former gold mining settlement,
Bodie's glory years were 1877 to 1882, when it boasted a population
of 10,000 and a bawdy downtown crowded with saloons, stores and
brothels.</TE>
<TE>   Today, it is a state historic park so authentic that rusty mining
gear and buckboard wagon parts are left scattered in the streets. You
can peer in the windows of the schoolhouse and see dusty primers
sitting on desks, a pen in an inkwell and a teacher's final
instructions written on a blackboard, details that suggest the
children had merely stepped out for recess.</TE>
<TE>   Located off U.S. 395 northeast of Mammoth, Bodie sits in a shallow
valley at 8,600 feet and has no snack bar, no campsites, no modern
amenities to mar its eerie ambience. The drive in is a vintage
experience in itself: a gut-busting road, the last three miles
deliberately left unpaved to enhance the visitor's sense of
isolation.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time you get to Bodie, your car is dusty and you are back
in time," said Doug Brodie, co-author of a town history. "There's
this ethereal feeling about the place that you can't get anywhere
else."</TE>
<TE>   Calico More Accessible</TE>
<TE>   Calico is remote too, located in the middle of the Mojave Desert,
but it sits just off Interstate 15, and thus is far more accessible
to tourists. Half-a-million people visit Calico each year, compared
with the 131,000 who manage to find Bodie.</TE>
<TE>   Like Bodie, Calico came to be thanks to mining--a silver strike in
1881. But only a handful of original buildings remain, and Calico's
operators have not been shy about trying to spice up the destination
for visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from restaurants, RV hookups and gold-panning lessons, there
is an array of special events at Calico--Civil War reenactments, a
chili cook-off, a Wild West parade and the National Gunfight Stunt
Championships. The festivities reflect Calico's onetime owner, Walter
Knott of Knott's Berry Farm fame, who bought the withering town in
1951, restored it and then donated it to San Bernardino County as a
park.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Potter, the county's chief of regional parks, does not dispute
Bodie's ghost town credentials. But Calico, he declared, has the best
of both worlds--old, restored buildings and historic mines, plus
"interpretive programs and special events that make visiting a more
active experience."</TE>
<TE>   Potter worries that if Bodie becomes the official state ghost
town, it could nose out Calico for grants or other special funding:
"That is a nice feather in the cap," he said of the designation.</TE>
<TE>   Bodie backers say they have nothing against Calico but regard the
gunfights and other events as commercial distractions that disqualify
it from consideration as California's real ghost town. Calico, they
say, is more amusement park than authentic antique.</TE>
<TE>   "Bodie is a perfect example of the Old West--just the way the last
resident left it in the 1930s," said Brodie.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not degrading Calico, but it's a modernized, comfortable
ghost town."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Was Students' Idea</TE>
<TE>   Leslie has been to Calico and Bodie, and professes fondness for
both. But his bill, AB 1757, is an outgrowth of his invitation to
schoolchildren to submit ideas for legislation. The dozen seventh-
and eighth-graders at Lee Vining Junior High, about 30 miles from
Bodie, proposed the special ghost town status as a way to draw more
tourists and help the local economy.</TE>
<TE>   Janine Barbato, their teacher, said the process has been an
enriching one for the students. They researched the history of Bodie
to write language for the bill, and came to the Capitol to testify at
a committee hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "You can teach kids all you want about how laws are made," Barbato
said. "But unless they're really part of the process like this, it
doesn't mean much."</TE>
<TE>   Only a few legislators have voted against the bill during its
journey through the Legislature. One of them was state Sen. Jim
Brulte, who represents much of San Bernardino County--but not Calico.</TE>
<TE>   But even Brulte could not resist a humorous comment when asked
about the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "Not being an expert on the paranormal," he said, "I wasn't sure
how to judge the relative value of Bodie versus Calico Ghost Town.
But since Calico Ghost Town has a sign that says Calico Ghost Town, I
had to go with what my eyes could see."</TE>

<HD>Number of Uninsured in Question</HD>
<DH>Health care: UCLA study finds the total of state residents
without coverage is significantly lower than federal census figures
indicate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The most extensive study ever on the health insurance status of
Californians shows that the number of uninsured is significantly
lower than what many have long believed based on federal surveys.</LD>
<LD>   The finding that about 4.5 million non-elderly Californians are
uninsured--instead of the 6.3 million estimated by the Census
Bureau--was heartening to policy analysts and health professionals,
some of whom have viewed the widespread lack of health insurance as
one of society's most costly and intractable problems.</LD>
<LD>   But they noted that the number of uninsured still represents a
hefty 15% of Californians. The research suggests that the Census
Bureau's national estimate of 14% uninsured may be overstated, but
the study's authors cautioned against extrapolating from a survey of
one state that used a different methodology.</LD>
<TE>   The study, portions of which are being released today by the UCLA
Center for Health Policy Research, is expected to influence the
debate over public and private efforts to aid the uninsured. The
$12-million California Health Interview Survey, funded with
government and foundation money, has been reviewed by two outside
experts.</TE>
<TE>   The immediate effect could come from the way the report is used by
budget-strapped policymakers. Advocates for universal health care
worry that California's progress in covering low-income families
through government programs such as Medi-Cal will slow if the problem
of the uninsured is seen as less urgent.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's study shows significant gains in enrolling Californians in
Medi-Cal and in Healthy Families, which is geared more toward
covering children. These programs were a major factor in the
lower-than-expected numbers of uninsured. The study also makes clear
that enrollees received more frequent and critical care than
uninsured people.</TE>
<TE>   But Gov. Gray Davis' new budget already has done away with
outreach money for these programs and made other changes that are
likely to slow, if not reverse, the growth in Medi-Cal and Healthy
Families. A spokeswoman at the governor's office, which was briefed
on the study this week, said the state was pleased to have had a role
in UCLA's study but did not comment further. California's Department
of Health Services provided about $3.8 million for the two-year
project.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Robert Ross, chief executive of the California Endowment, a
health foundation that helped fund the UCLA research, said this was
not the time to be pulling back on efforts that have been working.
Though he said it was comforting to learn that "we have less of a
road to travel" to solve the uninsured problem, Ross expressed
concern that government budget cuts, combined with the sluggish
economy and soaring health insurance costs, will lead to a sharp
increase in the uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   "We could see these numbers radically shift in the other
direction," he said.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA researchers said that the number of uninsured today probably
is higher than 4.5 million, because their survey was conducted last
year when the unemployment rate was lower than it is now.</TE>
<TE>   The state's impending cutbacks will be felt particularly in Los
Angeles County, which is proposing deep cuts in its public health
system. UCLA's research confirmed that the county is the epicenter of
the uninsured, with about 1.7 million without coverage, reflecting
its higher share of people with less income and education and without
citizenship or permanent resident status. Statewide, nearly 900,000
people who are uninsured said they did not have green cards.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers interviewed adults and adolescents in more than 55,400
randomly selected homes, about 10 times the sample size of the Census
Bureau's annual survey. Interviews were conducted in six languages
and included people who had no telephones in their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have suspected that the census health insurance data
undercounted certain groups, but the magnitude of the difference from
the UCLA study was surprising, even when taking into account
variations in time frame and methodology.</TE>
<TE>   One key difference is that UCLA's survey asked people whether they
were currently insured, whereas the census asks respondents in March
about their insurance coverage in the previous year. Census surveys
consistently have reported uninsured rates in the 20% range for
California, with the most recent estimate, for the year 2000, at
exactly 20%.</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA research also found higher rates of job-based coverage
and private insurance in California than did the census report.
Census Bureau officials said they could not comment on a study they
have not yet reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   National policy experts said that what may be more important than
a snapshot of the uninsured population is the trend. Families USA, a
consumer group in Washington, has estimated that the number of
uninsured nationally rose by 2.2 million last year, to 41 million, as
unemployment and insurance costs rose.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the 4.5 million identified as the core group of
uninsured, researchers found that nearly 2 million others in
California had temporary lapses in their medical coverage. Separate
data on this group suggests that many of them occurred when the
workers were between jobs.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's study also made a finer distinction, noting that 80% of the
core group were chronically uninsured and deserved special attention.</TE>
<TE>   The survey also dispelled what analysts called a myth about the
uninsured: that they largely are unemployed or young people who think
they don't need insurance. In fact, only about 10% of the uninsured
statewide said they did not believe in health insurance; most said
they could not afford to buy insurance or were unable to obtain
coverage through their employer.</TE>
<TE>   About 1 in 6 California workers, excluding those self-employed,
said their employers do not offer health insurance. The survey shows
that the larger the firm, the more likely it is to provide health
benefits. But whether workers are offered insurance by their employer
is probably more closely linked to their wages, industry and level of
unionization.</TE>
<TE>   Griselda Martinez, a 28-year-old mother of two in Pacoima, said
her husband has worked full-time for the same construction firm for
three years. Yet his employer does not offer coverage, so Martinez
and her family don't have health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   When someone gets sick, the Martinezes go to community clinics or
pay cash for doctor visits. In the past, Martinez said, she has
gotten some exams and medications when visiting Mexico, where they
are cheaper. But sometimes she simply delays care. A couple of years
ago, when she was burning up with fever and suffering abdominal
pains, she waited three days before her anxious husband finally
pushed her to see a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to stay healthy because I don't have insurance,"
Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   Latinos in California have the highest uninsured rate, at 28% of
the population, contrasted with less than 10% for whites and blacks
and 13% for Asian Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at UCLA said their study underscores the travails of
uninsured residents such as the Martinez family.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that some policymakers and the public think is
that people who have no insurance nevertheless get care," said E.
Richard Brown, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy
Research. "Our data show that's not true."</TE>
<TE>   The study found that 26% of uninsured children and adolescents had
no usual source of care, but that figure dropped to 6% for those
covered by Medi-Cal or Healthy Families.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA researchers said that enrollment in Medi-Cal and Healthy
Families grew by more than 500,000 over the 10-month period of their
survey last year. But there are an additional 1.1 million uninsured
children and adults eligible for these programs who are not enrolled,
many because they did not believe they qualified or had never heard
of Healthy Families.</TE>

<LD>All indications suggest that President Bush's anticipated peace plan
for Palestinians and Israelis will only deepen the confusion
regarding U.S. policy. Conflicting and contradictory statements from
senior officials have left people throughout the region, and many in
the United States, at a loss in trying to make out what the
administration plans to do.</LD>
<LD>   Now Bush is expected to recommend the creation of an "interim"
Palestinian state as the key element in ending 20 months of carnage.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently he will propose taking the status quo of nominal
Palestinian rule in 40% of the West Bank and renaming it a state,
although it would not have the rights and responsibilities of an
actual state.</LD>
<TE>   This idea is not simply a nonstarter, it is nonsense.</TE>
<TE>   Interim independence and partial sovereignty make as much sense
politically as a woman being somewhat pregnant. Independence and
sovereignty are either fully realized or meaningless.</TE>
<TE>   Much the same may be said about the president's repeated calls for
the Palestinian Authority to become democratic. While Palestinian
reforms are clearly needed, it is absurd to speak of creating a
democracy among noncitizens of a nonstate under a foreign military
occupation and without meaningful sovereignty.</TE>
<TE>   What is available under such conditions is, at best, the democracy
of a high school student council, not that of a free people in a
sovereign republic. Americans are heirs to a grand tradition of
insight about the basic requirements of liberty and independent
self-government--concepts that are casually betrayed by the facile
blather about democracy without citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinian extremists are busy ensuring
that the conflict deteriorates to the point where no plan will stop
the killing.</TE>
<TE>   The intensity, viciousness and frequency of Palestinian suicide
attacks against Israeli civilians have only increased as a result of
Israel's recent rampages and the sacking of many West Bank cities.
Israel's plan, announced Wednesday, to reoccupy Palestinian-ruled
areas is not a change of policy; it's a continuation of Israeli
behavior over the last five months. More of the same will meet with
just as little success.</TE>
<TE>   And Israel's new "security fence" is another chimera offered up by
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who continues to feed his people
the illusion that the Palestinian uprising can be crushed and the
occupation then continued in peace and security.</TE>
<TE>   According to numerous reports, Sharon told a closed meeting of the
U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week that there would be
no peace deal for at least 10 years; that Israel was prepared for a
100-year struggle; that a Palestinian state was out of the question
any time soon; and that the key to Israel's security was 1 million
new Jewish immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   The irony is that, in spite of the ascendancy of radicals on both
sides, there is much for a genuinely committed White House to work
with.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians still have a secular leadership that is committed
to establishing an independent state alongside Israel and that is
not, as many falsely claim, dedicated to its destruction. A recent
working paper presented to the Bush administration by senior
Palestinian officials reiterates several far-reaching concessions
made in the 2001 Taba talks regarding borders, Jerusalem,
demilitarization and refugees.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of Israelis are still in favor of a two-state
solution, and serious progress would surely revive the dormant
Israeli peace movement.</TE>
<TE>   The plan forwarded by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah and adopted by
the Arab League provides an excellent basis for multi-party talks
designed to create a permanent peace based on total Arab recognition
of Israel, provided the occupation ends.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, the Bush administration can proceed on the basis
of its own stated positions--including support for an independent
Palestinian state--which, if translated into proactive policies,
would constitute a decisive intervention on behalf of peace.</TE>
<TE>   What Bush needs to do is embrace his own vision, base U.S. policy
on this vision and create a practical plan to bring it quickly into
effect.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the extremists, such a policy would enjoy powerful support
from a majority of Americans, Israelis and Palestinians, as well as
other Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   It would offer the only real chance in the foreseeable future to
end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</TE>

<HD>Damming the Money Stream of the Water Profiteers</HD>
<DH>This resource isn't 'theirs.' It belongs to all of us.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE MILLER</AU>
<BD>Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) wrote the 1992 Central
Valley Project Improvement Act. He represents portions of Contra
Costa and Solano counties in Congress.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Californians who recently learned a very expensive lesson about
futures trading from Enron Corp. may soon get a second dose of market
manipulation, this time courtesy of the federal government.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of watching out for the water needs--and pocketbooks--of
taxpayers, the Department of the Interior may soon sign long-term
water contracts that provide multimillion-dollar windfalls to
agricultural corporations at the expense of cities and consumers.</LD>
<LD>   A hundred years ago, Congress made a bargain with farmers in the
dry West: Taxpayers would subsidize dams, canals and water to promote
settlement and irrigate family farms. In return, farmers would have
to repay only a fraction of the true cost of the investment. The
subsidies were locked into long-term contracts that the Interior
Department signed with water districts promising to deliver millions
of acre-feet.</LD>
<TE>   Yet for decades, some reclamation beneficiaries in California's
Central Valley have been farming the taxpayers as much as the land.</TE>
<TE>   Huge companies maneuvered to capture the multibillion-dollar
subsidy intended for family farmers, leading Congress to close the
loopholes and reduce the subsidies that encourage overuse of water
resources.</TE>
<TE>   Now the original water contracts are expiring, and Interior must
negotiate new contracts under much tighter terms dictated by a
historic 1992 water reform law. Given the growing demand for water
throughout the state, some of these giant farm operations have a new
scheme for enriching themselves at public expense: Instead of using
subsidized water for growing crops, they want to sell some of their
government-provided water back to the government--or to water-short
cities or farms--for huge profits.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett Raley, who is in charge of the federal water program at
the Interior Department, approves. "We believe in the free market,"
Raley says. "It's their water." Well, actually, it isn't "their"
water.</TE>
<TE>   The water originates in the mountains and the rivers of this great
state. It belongs not to any particular contractor or farmer but to
all the people of California, who paid for its development, storage
and delivery with costly subsidies. The Interior Department's
customers enjoy the use of the water only because of their contracts
with the government, and those contracts now need to be renegotiated.</TE>
<TE>   The government signed contracts to provide subsidized water for
food and fiber production, not to award a public resource to a
particular group that could convert it into an annuity for personal
profit. If there is a market in California for $1,000 an
acre-foot--and there is--why would any responsible federal official
sign a 25-year contract to sell water to farming concerns that will
resell it for a profit of 800% or 1,000%?</TE>
<TE>   If the water market is that healthy, why shouldn't the taxpayers,
who built and subsidized the projects in the first place, get to sell
the water for a large profit?</TE>
<TE>   If the contractor's intent in signing a new contract is merely to
market a portion of the water, then, learning from the Enron example,
we should not be concentrating public resources in the hands of a few
private individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Yet farming interests, many with long-standing ties to the Bush
administration, are pressuring federal officials to sign new
contracts that deliver them control of vast amounts of water.</TE>
<TE>   Water is already an overcommitted resource in California, with
competing interests divided among cities, agriculture, industry and
the environment. Global warming has raised concerns of diminished
Sierra snowpacks and runoffs in the future, which would reduce our
ability to fill our reservoirs.</TE>
<TE>   Surely this is not the time for responsible government officials
to commit water to one group of contractors and force the rest of the
state to cut deals that enrich private interests from the sale of
public resources.</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't it make sense for Raley and his co-workers at the Interior
Department to use great caution in deciding how much of the public's
subsidized water to include in those new contracts, instead of
promising vast volumes that irrigators will turn around and
resell--perhaps even to the government--at a huge profit?</TE>
<TE>   It's not their water, Mr. Raley, unless you give it away.</TE>

<HD>A Policy Scarier Than the Movie</HD>
<DH>In seeking to attack Iraq, the president is pushing a
minority report.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York. E-mail: pinkerto@ix.netcom.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Did you hear about the government's new plan to launch anticipatory
strikes against evildoers? No, not President Bush's policy, announced
June 1, of "preemptive action when necessary to defend our liberty
and to defend our lives." That's old news.</LD>
<LD>   Now it's time to look ahead, to "Minority Report," the new Steven
Spielberg movie that offers a window into a dystopian future when
government's power is taken to new extremes. If the film scares you,
remember, it isn't "only a movie"--it's real life too.</LD>
<LD>   "Minority Report," set in 2054, imagines that the government has
set up a Department of Precrime using the clairvoyance of three
mutant "precogs" to see criminality before it happens.</LD>
<TE>   But sometimes the visions of the precogs differ, in which case a
minority report is filed alongside the majority report. And so the
plot thickens.</TE>
<TE>   The film gets its eerie resonance from the rush of reality, from
what's happening in the here and now. Already, Uncle Sam is using
spooky techniques of profiling and data-mining to gain clues about
things to come. In the words of FBI Director Robert Mueller: "What we
need to do better is be predictive....We have to develop the
capability to anticipate attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Bush believes that future attacks will come from the "axis of
evil"--North Korea, Iran and Iraq--that he singled out for stigma in
his State of the Union address.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a bug in the "Bush Doctrine." Put bluntly, the
president's "pre-knowledge" about these nations puts him in the
distinct minority.</TE>
<TE>   For openers, North Korea. South Korea--as well as every other
Asian state--believes that North Korea is more likely to starve its
own citizens than attack its neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   As for Iran, just Monday the 15-member European Union decided to
open formal trade relations with Tehran despite strong objections
from Washington. The Europeans have long done business with Iran, but
their decision underscores their rejection of Bush's Iran- isolating
policy.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Washington has, in effect, filed two Iranian minority
reports. First, the U.S. is in the lonely position of declaring a
trade embargo that the rest of the world ignores. Second, at the same
time, bizarrely enough, the Bush administration has ended up on the
same side as Iran in its reluctance to ratify the United Nations
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against
Women. And so it's the U.S.--plus Iran--against the 169 countries
that have ratified this equal-rights treaty.</TE>
<TE>   But of course, in the Bush view, the big enchilada of evil is
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   And it takes no special powers to divine the commander in chief's
intentions: "I made up my mind that Hussein needs to go," he said
April 4.</TE>
<TE>   Leading Democrats agree that a U.S.-imposed "regime change" in
Iraq is a matter of when, not if.</TE>
<TE>   But here again, in its preoccupation with Baghdad, the U.S. is in
the world minority, destined to attack alone (although perhaps a
couple of other countries will provide token support). To be sure,
anti-Iraq hawks insist that many countries secretly support American
preemption.</TE>
<TE>   But consider: According to this scenario, countries would be lying
when they said they opposed Bush administration military action. But
if a country is willing to lie to the world publicly about its true
policy, how do we know that in fact that same country isn't lying to
the U.S. privately?</TE>
<TE>   The answer, of course, is to move from one-on-one preemption to
planetary persuasion. That is, if Bush has a good case against Iraq,
let him take it to the world; let him turn his present-day minority
into a future anti-Saddam Hussein majority.</TE>
<TE>   If he insists on acting alone, however, and if other countries see
an Iraq attack as merely the arbitrary use of Pentagon power, then
one need not be a precog to see what will happen next. If the U.S. as
global leader lets loose a new doctrine of preemption, then other
countries will feel emboldened to identify "pre-aggression" all
around them, launching unilateral attacks of their own whenever it
suits them.</TE>
<TE>   That's a forecast based on history, not technology. In the age of
loose nukes, the idea of Washington green-lighting a return to
earlier lawless eras, those of lone-wolf attacks across sovereign
borders, is scarier than anything in the movies.</TE>

<HD>We on the Gay Right Find Diplomacy Can Work Wonders</HD>
<DH>When mistaken for a man, I gently correct.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I used to be bothered and embarrassed when strangers mistook me for a
man, especially when it happened in public restrooms. I felt left out
by what Foucaultians and other leftist intellectuals like to call
"gender norms." I didn't fit, and to me the fault lay with--to borrow
another radical's pet phrase--the heterosexist hegemony, the
insidiousness of which had made me into a pariah among my own sex and
a virtual Medusa in the eyes of the opposite sex. And all this
because I had a boy's wardrobe, short hair, masculine features and a
deep voice. Go figure.</LD>
<LD>   If the world couldn't see me through my disguise, I thought, it
was the world, not I, who was going to have to change.</LD>
<LD>   And that, in a nutshell, is what leftist gay politics is all
about. Making the world change to suit the outcast. Not an ignoble
cause on the face of it. Everyone deserves respect, after all, as
well as a certain degree of recognition. This is no less than the
founding principle of our Bill of Rights. All libertarian-minded folk
are in harmony with left liberals on this point--even gay
conservatives, whom Village Voice Senior Editor Richard Goldstein has
dubbed "homocons."</LD>
<TE>   Web pundit Andrew Sullivan and I, who are respectively Goldstein's
homocon boogie man and the Wicked Witch of the West, have been
invited to debate Goldstein next week at Manhattan's New School
University in a panel discussion titled "The Great Gay Political
Debate." At the heart of this debate is no less than the future of
gay politics. The issue? How do we go about getting what we want: by
rebellion or diplomacy, protest or pragmatism? Certainly the answer
is not by simply fighting each other.</TE>
<TE>   Because when it comes down to it, we homocons want the same things
the liberals want, that is, fundamental equality and multicultural
inclusiveness. We homocons are pursuing goals that are just as noble
as those of gay liberals; we simply pursue them in a different way.
They want society to come to them, or better yet to succumb to them;
we want society to meet us halfway. They see themselves as
guerrillas; we, by contrast, see ourselves as ambassadors of sorts.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called gay right is not monolithic, but I suspect Sullivan
and others share my belief that politics is deeply personal, that
somewhere between the odd individual (us) and the tyrannical majority
(them) lies an acceptable peace and that somewhere between the
stultifying closet and the topless traipse down Fifth Avenue is
something called being yourself with impunity.</TE>
<TE>   Change happens in democratic societies because people bend,
because people accommodate one another slowly with an arsenal of
goodwill and sound argument, not because they confront one another
with a rhetorical blunderbuss in one hand and the sword of
righteousness in the other.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps this sounds facile, a little too Disney for the real,
savage "power structure" we live in. But I embrace this simple policy
not because it sounds good, or because I am desperate to be accepted
by the straight world, or because I lack the courage to undermine or
overthrow the enemy--but because it's what works.</TE>
<TE>   When people still mistake me for a man I gently correct them, with
a joke if possible. I win my small battles in the restroom instead of
the courtroom because I know that juries are made up of people who
use public toilets. I prefer to persuade the world one person at a
time.</TE>
<TE>   I prefer to think of this as humanist libertarianism rather than
conservative politics, but my fellow pundits on the gay left prefer
to see it as a capitulation to or collusion with a world they cannot
forgive for rejecting them.</TE>

<LD>Marion "Suge" Knight, no dope he, knows that the more offensive he
is, the more CDs he'll sell. So the ex-con who fancies himself the
baddest rap music impresario of all is probably delighted by the
reaction to the billboard he put up last week over the offices of his
Tha Row Records (formerly Death Row Records)  at a Wilshire Boulevard
intersection. For every adult infuriated by the sign's offensive
picture and language, Knight must figure he'll amuse and titillate at
least that many kids and young adults--his customers.</LD>
<LD>   But for Knight's neighbors, and their young children, the
billboard is just one more assault on the quality of life in Los
Angeles and one more illustration of the impotence or unwillingness
of local leaders to address the issues that drive people nuts.</LD>
<LD>   The lighted billboard, at Wilshire and San Vicente boulevards, is
a cartoonish drawing of a black man sitting on a toilet with his
pants down around his ankles. Beneath the toilet is a phrase
containing an obscenity.</LD>
<TE>   The neighbors are furious. They can choose not to buy Tha Row's
albums to avoid hearing the endless stream of obscenities on them,
but they can't avoid seeing this billboard every time they leave
home. They want the city, meaning their councilman, Jack Weiss, to do
something. We have to wonder why he doesn't seem to be getting any
help from African American politicians, who surely would attack this
offensive depiction were it posted by Disney or any other large
corporation.</TE>
<TE>   We'd like to blame the billboard companies for this visual
garbage. After all, Eller Media's name is on the steel frame that
Knight's sign hangs on. Eller is one of a handful of outdoor
advertisers whose huge billboards junk up Los Angeles with ads for
hamburgers, movies and strip clubs. But Eller claims Tha Row simply
commandeered Eller's billboard over the record company's offices,
erected its own advertisement and barred Eller staff from the
premises. Moreover, Eller claims that it and the other sign companies
have adopted standards--don't laugh now--governing the content of the
ads they will accept. Tha Row's ad, Eller says, wouldn't meet its
standards.</TE>
<TE>   Knight probably will pull down his billboard when it loses its
shock value. Weiss and his council colleagues are still waiting for a
billboard ordinance passed in February to take effect, still
negotiating with the billboard industry over the ordinance's scope
and cost. This sorry episode should finally prod them to take control
over the city's ugly forest of billboards.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Weiss has asked the city attorney what action the
city can legally take. Finding an answer will be tough, given laws
protecting, in this case, a very loose definition of artistic
expression. But City Atty.  Rocky Delgadillo and L.A. County District
Atty. Steve Cooley should try to figure out whether state obscenity
and local zoning ordinances can't work to remove this affront.</TE>

<LD>Lay-deeees and gentlemen, Jesse Ventura has just tossed himself out
of the Minnesota governor's ring. But please, please, don't throw
your chairs. The Body has not left the building. The large maverick
politician, who successfully tapped the militant center in a 1998
race, has until July 16 to change his mind and seek another term as
Minnesota's chief executive.</LD>
<LD>   It's been an interesting, refreshing and even instructive show,
watching the former pro wrestler, former Navy SEAL, former suburban
mayor and current showman do his populist thing in the land that gave
arid Los Angeles a basketball team named for lakes. That's the
entertainment part of modern American politics in an age when quick
sound bites pass for policy positions.</LD>
<LD>   Remember no-nonsense Jesse's ads with his plastic action figure
fighting for average voters? How many blow-dried, perfectly dressed,
well-rehearsed politicians would dare?</LD>
<TE>   So the fiscal conservative/social liberal celebrity won with 37%
of the vote in his three-way race. Polls now show him at 43%
approval. But 49% disapprove. And he once had more than  70%
approval. That was before this year's state deficit and before 12 of
Ventura's vetoes were overturned--a record--by  elected officials who
aren't media magnets but who put in the wonky effort to assemble a
workable budget.</TE>
<TE>   And that was before fresh allegations that Ventura's son and the
son's pals trashed the governor's mansion in all-night booze parties.</TE>
<TE>   A desire for family privacy was the governor's major stated reason
for throwing in the towel. Going on statewide radio to express your
burning desire for privacy makes as much sense in Ventura's world as
it does for scantily clad Hollywood starlets to complain about being
sex objects. Watch a cable channel near you for this governor who
says he seeks privacy.</TE>
<TE>   Saying what you think for the cameras is one thing. Consistently
getting things done outside the spotlight and inside the tedious
world of democratic government is something else. It's no photo op
for folks in pink boas.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura's real contribution to politics may be his candor, his
pointing out and playing on a powerful, simmering voter
dissatisfaction with America's canned, brand-name politics. That's
the historical venting role of the third and fourth parties that
flare up at times. Political parties No. 1 and No. 2 ignore this old
lesson at their renewed peril.</TE>

<LD>As Palestinian suicide bombers continue to explode their deadly nail
bombs in crowds of Israeli civilians and Israel moves in fury to take
back parts of the West Bank, President Bush has hesitated, putting
his widely anticipated proposal of a new peace process on hold. But
Bush must return firmly to his call for the creation of an interim
Palestinian state. Left to their own devices, Israelis and
Palestinians will remain trapped in a worsening cycle of violence.
Only focused American diplomatic initiatives and influence have a
chance of creating peace.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush plan, as outlined in news reports, offers a way forward.
It would create an interim Palestinian state as early as September
with provisional boundaries that encompass 40% to 50% of West Bank
and Gaza Strip territories. It is supposed to be approved at an
international peace conference--as long as the Palestinians can show
they have made progress in stopping terrorism and in reshaping their
own security forces, a project on which CIA Director George J. Tenet
is working.</LD>
<LD>   Any interim agreement would be based on the Oslo accords, the
land-for-peace framework that both sides agreed to in 1993. The
toughest issues, such as the Palestinian insistence on East Jerusalem
as a capital, would be put off, to be settled within three years.</LD>
<TE>   Neither Israeli nor Palestinian officials are enthusiastic about
an interim state. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is peddling the
illusion that a fence can protect Israelis. He sees any form of
statehood as the road to full Palestinian sovereignty, whereas Arab
leaders see any interim step as a dangerous diversion from
establishing a fully legitimate, independent state. The suspicion on
both sides is so high that only U.S. intervention can break the
impasse.</TE>
<TE>   One reason the violence has spiraled is because the Bush
administration initially backed away from the Clinton
administration's intensive efforts over several years to reach a
settlement. What looked to the incoming president like a rickety
stalemate, however, was a peaceful nirvana compared with today.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's reluctant endorsement of a peace proposal shows that he is
heeding moderate Arab allies, particularly Jordan's King Abdullah and
Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, who fear that their own countries
are becoming dangerously radicalized.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has realized that the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict jeopardizes the larger war on terrorism. However reluctant
he may have been to commit his prestige to ending the conflict, Bush
must not let suicide bombers exercise veto power over the peace
process.</TE>

<TE>   The positive assessment by Gen. Sunderajan Padmanabhan was the

Musharraf, promised last month to halt the incursions.</TE>

stranding passengers across the continent just as the busy summer

<TE>   Apart from a full-day walkout in France, controllers observed less

<HD>Bush Seeks Extra $300 Million to Help Fight AIDS</HD>
<DH>Health: Funds would go to curb mother-to-child HIV
transmission in the Caribbean and Africa.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush pledged Wednesday to seek an additional
$300 million to help nations in Africa and the Caribbean protect
infants from the spread of HIV, which experts say infects 2,000
newborns every day.</LD>
<LD>   "The global devastation of HIV/AIDS staggers the imagination and
shocks the conscience," Bush said in a brief Rose Garden appearance.</LD>
<LD>   Bush made his commitment as activists and many lawmakers on
Capitol Hill are calling for greater spending to combat the worldwide
spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. After the president's
announcement, some criticized his proposal as insufficient.</LD>
<TE>   "The fact is that the U.S. has ample resources to help fight
global AIDS. Yet, sadly, the president still seems unprepared to show
real leadership," said Paul Zeitz, executive director of the Global
AIDS Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's announcement preceded two high-profile annual gatherings
that will focus attention on the international fight against AIDS:
the Group of 8 meeting of the world's leading industrialized nations
next week in Canada, where a major emphasis will be on financial
assistance to Africa; and the XIV International AIDS Conference next
month in Barcelona, Spain.</TE>
<TE>   The $300 million that Bush intends to seek from Congress in fiscal
2004 would come on top of the current $200 million that the United
States is spending annually for the Mother and Child HIV Prevention
Initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Worldwide, acquired immune deficiency syndrome has killed more
than 20 million people and, Bush said, is "poised to kill at least 40
million more."</TE>
<TE>   Experts believe that one of the best ways to fight AIDS is to
prevent women from passing the human immunodeficiency virus to their
offspring during pregnancy, birth or breast-feeding.</TE>
<TE>   A key component of that strategy is to administer a dose of
nevirapine to the mother during labor, followed by a single dose to
the baby within 36 hours of birth. That treatment has decreased
mother-to-child transmission of the virus by as much as 50%.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said the increased funding for the program would allow a
total of 1 million women to be treated annually.</TE>
<TE>   The African countries that would be targeted by the expanded
program are Botswana, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique,
Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.
In the Caribbean, the aid would go to Guyana and Haiti.</TE>
<TE>   More countries could be added, the White House said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's program also would seek to improve local health care
delivery systems for women and infants, in part by training new
medical personnel.</TE>
<TE>   The emphasis on bolstering health care infrastructure won praise
from Mark Isaac, director of public policy for the Elizabeth Glaser
Pediatric AIDS Foundation, based in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   "This truly demonstrates leadership on the part of the president,"
he said. "This is of a size and scope that is considerable and is
comprehensive in nature. And it's going to save lives around the
world."</TE>
<TE>   Those criticizing Bush's announcement included Sen. Barbara Boxer
(D-Calif.), who termed the program "simply inadequate."</TE>
<TE>   That view was echoed by Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), who is
working with Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) to double the current $1
billion a year the U.S. spends to fight AIDS outside its borders.</TE>
<TE>   Isaac said his foundation also supports further spending
increases. "We don't pretend what Bush has proposed is enough," he
said. "But it's a steppingstone to a wider, comprehensive response."</TE>

<HD>Scuttled in a Sea of Mystery</HD>
<DH>Modern explorers think they have found one of Columbus'
ships off Panama. The deeper question is who has the rights to it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PLAYA DAMAS, Panama</DL>
<LD>Warren White and his son were swimming just off the beach when they
saw it.</LD>
<LD>   About 16 feet below them, a mass of coral and rock reared up from
the sandy bottom. On top, in plain view, sat two coral-encrusted
cannons.</LD>
<LD>   "Look at those guns," White thought. "Those things are ancient."</LD>
<TE>   So ancient, in fact, that White and a handful of scholars have
come to believe that the wreck is one of Christopher Columbus' ships,
the Vizcaina, abandoned in 1503 during his last voyage.</TE>
<TE>   The indications are intriguing. The location seems to match a
description of the scene of the Vizcaina's scuttling. The cannons are
from the right period. So is a piece of pottery.</TE>
<TE>   If true, it would be the first time anyone has found one of the
nine ships Columbus lost during his four expeditions to the New
World, controversial passages that opened a new continent to
exploration and exploitation.</TE>
<TE>   Despite years of research, scholars still aren't sure what
Columbus' ships looked like, what they carried or how they managed
their long voyages. Everything that is known about them comes from
written accounts or bureaucratic records sorely lacking in details.</TE>
<TE>   That's why White's discovery may be so important. Whether or not
it is the Vizcaina--and there is skepticism--the wreck is almost
certainly one of the oldest found in this hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a big gap in knowledge," said John de Bry, director of
the Center for Historical Archeology, a Florida-based nonprofit group
that specializes in ships of the Spanish colonial era. "We know more
about the construction of Roman ships than the ships of exploration."</TE>
<TE>   That also explains why so much controversy now surrounds the
wreck, and the people exploring it.</TE>
<TE>   A private group backed by U.S. investors who call themselves
"treasure hunters" is excavating the find. While promising to respect
the wreck's historical worth, the group is clear in its intention to
make money off it, either through film rights or the selling of
artifacts.</TE>
<TE>   Marine archeologists, however, say the group already has badly
bungled the recovery, carelessly yanking up artifacts, botching
preservation and perhaps destroying evidence that could help solve
the mystery of the ship's identity.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it will turn out to be a ship that can be identified with
early explorers and conquistadors," said Donald Keith, an underwater
archeologist who has spent years trying to find Columbus' wrecks.
"Whatever it is, it's important--and we can learn a lot from it, but
only if we do it right.</TE>
<TE>   "None of these people know what they're doing, and they're
shooting themselves in the foot."</TE>
<TE>   The controversy places White's discovery squarely in the middle of
one of the biggest legal questions of the modern era: the ownership
of treasures held by the sea.</TE>
<TE>   There are thousands upon thousands of wrecked ships on the world's
sea bottom, ranging from ancient Greek vessels to the Titanic. As
undersea technology has improved, more and more of them have been
opened to exploration. Just last month, shipwreck hunter Robert
Ballard claimed to have found John F. Kennedy's World War II patrol
boat in the South Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   That means more wrecks have also been exploited for plunder. The
problem has grown so serious in recent years that the United Nations
launched a drive to better protect shipwrecks. Last year, the U.N.
General Assembly gave preliminary approval to the archeological
underwater convention, the first of its kind.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the controversy over the wreck found in Panama is
similar to the one that has attached itself to Columbus: the nature
of discovery.</TE>
<TE>   What counts as a discovery? What rights does a discoverer have?
Who else shares in them? And what happens to the people or things
discovered?</TE>
<TE>   "The storms continue to pursue Columbus' ships," said Rafael
Ruiloba, director of Panama's National Cultural Institute.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   By 1502, Columbus was on his last legs. He was 51. He was
suffering from gout. He had failed to find riches or a new route from
Europe to the Indian Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   And so he decided to make one more voyage to the Americas from
Cadiz, Spain, in four vessels: the Gallega, the Vizcaina, the
Capitana and the Santiago. The trip would prove a disaster.</TE>
<TE>   He lost one ship, the Gallega, in the Belen River on Panama's
Caribbean coast as he fled a band of natives angry over his crew's
pillaging of local gold and the imprisonment of their leader and his
family.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus headed south, but the Vizcaina was leaking badly, the
victim of sea worms that had destroyed its hull. Columbus decided to
abandon the Vizcaina. Later, he was marooned in Jamaica and had to
abandon his last two ships as well.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus wrote that he scuttled the Vizcaina in Portobelo, the
Spanish colony near Playa Damas through which all the gold taken from
the Inca empire in Peru would one day pass.</TE>
<TE>   The ship disappeared, literally and figuratively, into obscurity.
Five hundred years later, the mystery of its whereabouts would become
White's obsession.</TE>
<TE>   White, a hobby diver and amateur historian, comes from a family of
salvagers. His great-uncle, for one, worked for an insurance company,
pulling wrecks off reefs in the Florida Keys.</TE>
<TE>   By 1995, the native Floridian had retired from his job as a
policeman, moved to Panama and begun nurturing a dream of discovering
the Vizcaina.</TE>
<TE>   Given the ambiguous geography in early records, White thought that
the ship might have actually been abandoned near modern-day Nombre de
Dios, a town near Portobelo that boasted a more convenient harbor to
flee from in case of danger.</TE>
<TE>   The quest for the Vizcaina became grist for late-night
conversations with friends.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd clink our glasses and say, 'Nombre de Dios,' " said White,
whose white hair and portly belly make him resemble a kindly
grandfather more than a treasure diver.</TE>
<TE>   At first, White found nothing. Then he noticed a cove near Nombre
de Dios called Playa Damas, about 14 miles east of Portobelo. It was
similar to the description of the place where the boat was scuttled,
on a reef behind two small islands.</TE>
<TE>   In May 1998, White and his son were exploring the cove when White
decided to make one last pass in search of lobster for dinner.
Instead, he saw the shipwreck. Although White recognized the
characteristic straight lines and bulk of an undersea wreck, the
cove's isolation had apparently kept the wreck secret for hundreds of
years.</TE>
<TE>   He contacted the Panamanian government but got no response.</TE>
<TE>   "They said they weren't interested in an old Spanish wreck," White
said.</TE>
<TE>   The wreck seemed destined to be abandoned a second time.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Marine Investigations of the Isthmus came into the
picture.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Last October, White bumped into Nilda Vasquez outside the sailboat
he lives on near Portobelo.</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez had run a diving tour business in the area for years and
worked as a volunteer for the local office of the cultural institute.</TE>
<TE>   White's story interested her. She, too, had Vizcaina fever, having
looked for the wreck intensively during 1992, the 500th anniversary
of Columbus' arrival in the New World.</TE>
<TE>   She immediately thought that Marine Investigations, which had
hired her son as its local representative, might be able to fund the
exploration.</TE>
<TE>   The group, backed by U.S. investors, was very interested in
finding treasure off Panama's coast. It had signed a deal to do so
with the cultural institute in May 2000.</TE>
<TE>   If the group found treasure, the Panamanian government would get
35% of the proceeds. The government could also opt to buy anything
the group found, provided that it paid fair market value.</TE>
<TE>   But the group's investors suddenly realized that a Columbus
shipwreck would be a bonanza.</TE>
<TE>   The investors said, " 'So what if it's a Columbus ship?' I said,
'If it is, we've got the richest ship in the world,' " said Isaac
Nunn, who represents the investors.</TE>
<TE>   Nunn, who called the investors "treasure hunters," declined to
identify them or say how many were involved. He would say only they
were a "wealthy group" able to put up as much as $2 million for the
excavation, including site security and preservation tanks to hold
any artifacts.</TE>
<TE>   He portrayed the exploration as good for the Panamanian
government. The investors put up the money, he said, while the
government reaped the benefit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good deal," Nunn said.</TE>
<TE>   That's not how many Panamanians saw it, however. News of the
discovery and the deal behind it caused an uproar once it became
public in December.</TE>
<TE>   The local press questioned whether Vasquez had any undue influence
in obtaining the contract for Marine Investigations. She denied
having any.</TE>
<TE>   There were also questions about the terms of the deal. How to
determine the worth of a cannon from one of Columbus' ships? And
where would the state get the money to buy back the artifacts?</TE>
<TE>   Later that month, Ruiloba's government cultural office declared
the site a cultural patrimony. Nothing of historical value would
leave.</TE>
<TE>   But that declaration hasn't dissuaded the company from believing
that it still can force the government to pay the group for the
artifacts it wants to keep.</TE>
<TE>   Nunn said the investors are confident they can work out a deal on
any disputed items. And he dismissed concerns that historical
artifacts would be sold off. He said the group was focused on making
money from film rights.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't rule out, however, that the group might sell off surplus
artifacts--for instance, if 10,000 gold coins are found, some will go
to a museum and the rest will be sold.</TE>
<TE>   White, who is a partner in the group, also said that extra items
could be sold off.</TE>
<TE>   White, Vasquez and Nunn all said they were doing everything
possible to excavate the site in an archeologically sound way, noting
that they had built preservation tanks for the artifacts and were
working with the cultural institute.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Playa Damas is a beautiful, isolated place. Waves scud against the
beach, surrounded by palms, sea grape trees and a few homes.</TE>
<TE>   The wreck, which lies about 100 feet offshore, has yielded
evidence that it could be Columbus' ship.</TE>
<TE>   First, the ship had a large number of early 16th century cannons,
some of them loaded, as if on the defensive. White believes that they
might have been stripped from the Gallega. Second, the anchors
appeared to be resting amidships, as if they had been placed there to
weigh down the vessel to scuttle it.</TE>
<TE>   Rigging chains also indicated that the ship was square-rigged, as
it is believed the Vizcaina was. Also, stone cannonballs and a bronze
canister that served as a loading charge were used in the 16th
century.</TE>
<TE>   The strongest piece of evidence may be a small shard of pottery
that appears to date the wreck to at least the first half of the
1500s.</TE>
<TE>   "I am convinced," Ruiloba said. He said he had already been
offered money for a cannon, which he turned down.</TE>
<TE>   Others are more skeptical. Keith, a leading expert in the field,
has visited the site and seen some of the artifacts.</TE>
<TE>   He said he's doubtful that the ship is the Vizcaina, although he
can't rule it out without further investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The most damning evidence is a neck from a recovered ceramic
vessel, shaped in a way that didn't appear until toward the middle of
the 16th century.</TE>
<TE>   Keith said the excavation operation was poorly planned and
executed. A detailed site plan wasn't drawn up. Artifacts were
prematurely pulled from the sea floor. Preservation tanks were
inadequate, leading to the possibility that some artifacts might
decay.</TE>
<TE>   "Extravagant claims require extravagant evidence," Keith said. "If
you want this to be a particular ship, you have to prove it. They
have absolutely nothing, not one piece of evidence, that says this is
the Vizcaina."</TE>
<TE>   White, however, has no doubt that he has found the object of his
long obsession.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes that most of the artifacts will find their way to a
museum, and that his find will be the latest discovery attached to a
ship whose history of discovery stretches back 500 years.</TE>
<TE>   "To be able to put your hands on a ship of exploration. Think of
that," he said. "These ships are the reason we're here."</TE>

<HD>An Ambassador Who Puts Afghanistan Before Business</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Solar energy pioneer Ishaq Shahryar gave up U.S.
citizenship to represent homeland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When Ishaq Shahryar was a young man and the Afghanistan of his memory
flowed with milk and honey, he clambered with his friends among the
towering Buddhas of Bamian and danced in the sunshine on the cliffs
where they stood.</LD>
<LD>   The Buddhas are gone, toppled as surely as the life the youngsters
knew. And Shahryar, who escaped the calamities that were to befall
his country by gaining a scholarship to UC Berkeley at 18 and earning
a series of scientific degrees there and at UC Santa Barbara,
parlayed his expertise in solar technology into a luxurious life for
himself and his family in Pacific Palisades.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the man known for his pioneering role in the
development of the photovoltaic cell presented his credentials to
President Bush as the first Afghan ambassador to the United States in
23 years. It is Shahryar's bid to resurrect, if not the Buddhas of
Bamian destroyed by the Taliban last year, at least the promise of
the Afghanistan of his youth.</LD>
<TE>   "When I left in 1956 it was a beautiful country moving toward
modernity," Shahryar said over tea at Washington's Four Seasons
hotel, where he is living while the Afghan Embassy and ambassador's
residence are being renovated. "When I went back three months ago, it
was totally devastated, destroyed, it was unimaginable. The first two
days I cried."</TE>
<TE>   As the new government of Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan's transitional
president, struggles to get on its feet, Shahryar is expected to be a
critical part of its bid to draw private investment to the plundered
country. In the belief that he can help do so, he is giving up his
U.S. citizenship, selling his businesses, moving his wife and two
children from the Southern California they love to Washington, and
jumping with both feet into the steamy world of Afghan politics.</TE>
<TE>   "Two million Afghans gave up their lives while I was here making
my life," Shahryar said. "Certainly I can give up my businesses."</TE>
<TE>   In California, Shahryar embraced the life he made. He lives in an
ocean-side house that he longed to outfit with the solar panels he
designed--but said he couldn't because the neighbors object.</TE>
<TE>   The Ferris wheel at the Santa Monica pier operates on a
photovoltaic system designed by Solar Utility Inc., one of the
companies Shahryar founded. The same system provides power for the
parking structure at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. Solar-powered
emergency call boxes dotting local freeways were designed by
Shahryar. So were solar-powered lighting systems used in some bus
shelters and billboards.</TE>
<TE>   Even while building a fortune, Shahryar said, the plight of
Afghanistan has never been far from his mind. In 1979, after the
Soviet takeover of his homeland, he arranged for 60 relatives to flee
the country for new lives in and around Los Angeles. And after the
Taliban seized power six years ago and imposed a strict Islamic
government, he advised Afghanistan's exiled monarch, Mohammad Zaher
Shah, and worked with Karzai on economic development proposals.</TE>
<TE>   In his new role, Shahryar sees himself using his business acumen
to improve the prospects of his native country. He has hired former
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) to teach him the ways of
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Convinced that international investment will not flow until
Afghanistan is safer, he said he will spearhead efforts to expand the
peacekeeping force now operating in Kabul, the capital, into more
lawless regions.</TE>

<HD>Bomber Slips by Police; 7 Israelis Killed</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The suicide blast in Jerusalem is the second in
two days and comes after Sharon implements his new anti-terror
strategy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK and MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>JERUSALEM -- A suicide bomber eluded heavy security and blew himself
up next to a busy bus stop here during the evening rush hour
Wednesday, killing seven Israelis and underscoring the frustration
Israel faces in its efforts to thwart terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The second suicide bombing in two days took place even as the
Israeli government was implementing a new strategy that calls for
reoccupying parts of the West Bank as a deterrent against further
attacks. Israel retaliated for the latest attack by firing on targets
in the Gaza Strip from helicopter gunships.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses and the Israeli army reported early today that Israeli
troops had moved into Beitunia, a suburb of the West Bank city of
Ramallah. The army said it also entered the West Bank town of
Bethlehem and a refugee camp there, Dahaisha, and declared a curfew
for both.</LD>
<TE>   With the spiraling violence once again frustrating diplomacy,
President Bush shelved plans for a major speech in which he had been
expected to call for the creation of an interim Palestinian state.
Administration officials said Bush had not changed his opinion, but
believed the timing was not right given the latest attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to get people to focus on peace today when there's
still suffering from the consequences of terrorism as we speak," said
White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   The White House was clearly angered by yet another deadly attack,
which will only make selling the Bush plan harder in the Middle East
and at home.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrorists put everybody at hostage," Fleischer said. "The
terrorists are vetoing the peace process that would benefit the
Palestinian people the most."</TE>
<TE>   Making the tragedy even more frustrating was the fact that the
latest bombing took place at one of the most heavily guarded
junctions in Jerusalem--in a neighborhood called French Hill--in full
view of at least four police officers, who were unable to stop it.
Still burying the dead from the bombing the day before, the city had
been girded for attack, with authorities and wary residents well
aware that a suicide bomber was on the prowl.</TE>
<TE>   The police and bystanders saw the bomber jump out of a car across
the street and sprint to the bus stop, but they weren't quick enough
to catch him before he detonated the explosive.</TE>
<TE>   Keren Boyko, 13, who was being treated for shock Wednesday night
at a Jerusalem hospital, said she doesn't take buses anymore.
However, she and her mother happened to be driving by the bus stop on
their way home from a tennis game. The blast popped open the trunk of
their car and sent a severed hand flying across the windshield.</TE>
<TE>   "I was screaming that we have to go home, but my mother stopped
the car to help and when she got out she almost stepped on the hand,"
cried Boyko. "I'm so scared. I don't go on buses.''</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody has the feeling anymore that it can't happen to them,"
said her mother, Ilana Boyko, nodding.</TE>
<TE>   The latest victims reportedly include a 2-year-old girl and a
young boy, according to Israeli radio.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, which is affiliated with Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, claimed
responsibility for the bombing in a statement to news organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority condemned the attack. Associated Press
reported this morning that it had obtained an advance copy of a
speech Arafat plans to deliver later today calling on his people to
halt suicide attacks, saying the attacks are allowing Israel to
reoccupy Palestinian-controlled lands.</TE>
<TE>   French Hill is a tidy bedroom community of apartments and
townhouses that were built by Israel on lands captured from Jordan
during the 1967 Middle East War and is a similar neighborhood to
Gilo, south of Jerusalem, where a suicide bomber killed 19 other
people Tuesday morning on a bus. It was unclear, however, whether the
bombers had targeted those neighborhoods or were simply seeking
crowded places where they could inflict the maximum bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   Israel launched military operations Wednesday in both the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip, firing rockets from helicopter gunships into
Gaza and raiding several West Bank towns. Two Israeli soldiers, one
of them an officer, and at least one Palestinian were killed in a gun
battle in the West Bank town of Kalkilya, the Israeli army reported.
It said four more soldiers were injured.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Wednesday morning, before the latest bombing, the Israeli
government released a statement saying it was adopting a new strategy
in which it will seize swaths of Palestinian territory and hold them
until the terrorism stops. It appears that the first examples of the
new approach are in Kalkilya and Jenin, two West Bank hotbeds of
Islamic militancy.</TE>
<TE>   In Jenin, witnesses said the Israeli army moved mobile homes on
flatbed trucks and other equipment into an area near a refugee camp
by the city as though preparing for a lengthy stay.</TE>
<TE>   In other retaliatory measures Wednesday, Israeli helicopter
gunships struck at what Palestinians said were small metalworks
factories in the southern Gaza town of Khan Yunis, as well as in Gaza
City and the Jabaliya refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians reported that four people were injured when
helicopters fired two missiles at the Jabaliya target. One person
reportedly was injured in the Khan Yunis attack, where Palestinian
witnesses said four rockets hit a metalworks, destroying the
structure. A foundry in Gaza City was damaged by a rocket,
Palestinians said, but no injuries were reported.</TE>
<TE>   An army spokeswoman said soldiers in Kalkilya chased a pair of
militants into a building, where a fierce gun battle erupted between
the Palestinians and the troops.</TE>
<TE>   "The terrorists threw grenades at our soldiers and then opened
fire on them," the army spokeswoman said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. In addition to the Israeli troops killed and injured in
the gunfight, at least one Palestinian militant was shot, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The town's residents were under military curfew Wednesday night,
and Palestinians were unable to confirm the reports.</TE>
<TE>   Troops also entered the West Bank cities of Nablus and Hebron and
the village of Dura late Tuesday and early Wednesday on what the army
said were "pinpoint" operations to look for wanted militants. Troops
made arrests in each area, then pulled out, both the army and
Palestinians said.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, the army reported that a Palestinian had been shot
dead when he tried to enter the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba,
near Hebron, with a gun.</TE>
<TE>   In another development Wednesday, several dozen prominent
Palestinians signed an advertisement that ran in the Arabic daily Al
Quds calling for an end to suicide bombings. The advertisement was
placed by Sari Nusseibeh, a Palestinian official in charge of
Jerusalem, and Hanan Ashrawi, a legislator.</TE>
<TE>   "Stop sending our young people to carry out such attacks," the
advertisement demanded of militant groups who dispatch the bombers.
"We see no results in such attacks, but a deepening of the hatred
between both peoples and a deepening of the gap between us."</TE>
<TE>   The advertisement, which called on Palestinians to add their
signatures, was significant because suicide bombers have attained
near- mythic status in their society, depicted as heroes willing to
die for the cause of a Palestinian nation.</TE>
<TE>   Demick reported from Jerusalem and Curtius from Ramallah. Times
staff writer Robin Wright in Washington and special correspondent
Maher Abukhater in Ramallah contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Faulty Torpedo Sank Kursk, Russia Agrees</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Officials rule out a foreign attack or WWII mine
as cause of August 2000 accident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Nearly two years after the Kursk nuclear submarine sank in the
Barents Sea, a government commission has established that a faulty
torpedo, and not a foreign spy submarine or a World War II mine,
brought down the pride of the Russian navy.</LD>
<LD>   Industry, Science and Technology Minister Ilya I. Klebanov, head
of the commission investigating the August 2000 accident,
acknowledged Wednesday that a torpedo on board the Kursk accidentally
blew up. That explosion triggered a gigantic conflagration of other
torpedoes on board, which mangled the bow of the sub, causing it to
sink rapidly. All 118 aboard died.</LD>
<LD>   Klebanov said the commission would announce its complete findings
this month. "We have ruled out the collision version. We have also
ruled out the World War II mine version. There is only one version
left," Klebanov said.</LD>
<TE>   Just days after the navy lifted a 5-ton bow fragment from the
floor of the Barents Sea, he said the commission had recommended that
the navy not investigate further.</TE>
<TE>   The Kursk disaster was the first test of President Vladimir V.
Putin's leadership, and he was severely criticized for only belatedly
cutting short a summer break to fly to the scene that August.</TE>
<TE>   The storm of criticism helped shape Putin's presidency--he has
never repeated the error, and his popularity is high.</TE>
<TE>   The Kursk also exposed the navy's reflexive secrecy as officials
hedged or lied about the disaster in the days after the sub sank.</TE>
<TE>   Criticizing the two-year delay in a finding, Adm. Eduard Baltin,
former commander of the Black Sea Fleet, said it was clear from the
outset that a faulty torpedo was to blame.</TE>
<TE>   He said, however, that it still isn't clear what made the torpedo
blow up.</TE>
<TE>   "Submarine accidents such as this are much harder to investigate
than any aircraft accident," he said. "Torpedoes do not explode by
themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Some crewmen survived the initial blast, and 23 of them gathered
in the stern section of the vessel. At least two of them left notes,
but Russian officials say they could not have survived more than
about eight hours.</TE>
<TE>   After meeting relatives of the victims in the weeks after the
sinking, Putin pledged to raise the submarine and give the crew a
proper burial.</TE>
<TE>   The salvage operation cost $130 million. Experts had identified
115 of the crew members by late March.</TE>
<TE>   In the public shock wave that followed the Kursk's sinking, naval
officials insisted that a foreign submarine lurking in the Barents
Sea during Russian naval exercises was the most probable cause.</TE>
<TE>   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has always rejected
Russia's claim that a Western submarine could have hit the Kursk and
sunk it.</TE>
<TE>   In February, after last fall's successful operation to raise the
bulk of the Kursk, officials announced that the military was
abandoning the type of torpedoes used on the sub.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian naval chief, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, acknowledged in
February that the navy had placed unfounded trust in the torpedoes,
which are propelled by volatile hydrogen peroxide.</TE>

<HD>Karzai's Cabinet to Include Tajiks, Warlords</HD>
<DH>Government: Delegates reluctantly OK the president's
choices, but his reliance on old power brokers comes with certain
political risk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Afghan leader Hamid Karzai adopted a risky political strategy
Wednesday, deciding to include several warlords in his inner circle
and retain several key ethnic Tajiks in top government posts.</LD>
<LD>   Karzai was inaugurated as the nation's transitional president
later Wednesday as a nine-day loya jirga, or grand council, drew to a
close.</LD>
<LD>   The Cabinet was approved by a show of hands among the more than
1,500 delegates, but many seemed more resigned than genuinely pleased
with Karzai's choices.</LD>
<TE>   "We are satisfied but not very much," said Mohammed Hakim, an
ethnic Pushtun from the eastern region around the city of Gardez.
"The nation has not been given the right to select the Cabinet,
particularly the key ministries."</TE>
<TE>   The Pushtuns, who make up the largest of the nation's many ethnic
groups, have felt shortchanged in the power structure Karzai has put
in place since he became interim prime minister six months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Although Karzai is a Pushtun, his initial government was dominated
by ethnic Tajiks from the Northern Alliance, the army that helped
defeat the Taliban regime last fall. Karzai could not afford to
alienate them, because they still control significant parts of the
country.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Karzai retained Mohammed Qassim Fahim, a former
Northern Alliance commander, as defense minister and Abdullah, a
Northern Alliance spokesman, who goes by one name, as foreign
minister.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai also brought Fahim into his inner circle as one of three
vice presidents. The other two also are prominent commanders: Haji
Abdul Qadir, the Pushtun governor of Nangarhar province, and Karim
Khalili, an ethnic Hazara commander.</TE>
<TE>   Notably missing from the group was Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, an
Uzbek commander from northern Afghanistan. People close to the
warlord said he had been invited to be a vice president but had
declined because he did not want to move to Kabul, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   The risk for Karzai is that once inside the tent, the
warlords--rather than turning away from regional concerns and working
for the new government--will use their influence to hoard jobs for
their friends and perpetuate a system that relies on guns and money
to exercise power.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not a good idea to bring commanders into these positions,
because the idea that they will come to Kabul and lose power outside
is not the case," said Hedayat Amin Arsala, the outgoing finance
minister.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to downplay any impulse to count the number of slots
that went to each ethnic group, Karzai exhorted delegates to think of
every one as an Afghan, rather than a member of an ethnic group.</TE>
<TE>   "We are all connected to each other, we all belong to Afghanistan;
we are proud of it," he said. "Our feelings for the nation's
development are equal."</TE>
<TE>   Karzai did elevate a Pushtun to the Interior Ministry, naming Taj
Mohamad Wardak, who was a resident of the Los Angeles area for 15
years before returning to Afghanistan this year. He is viewed as
experienced, but some at the loya jirga expressed fears that Wardak,
who earlier this year gave his age as 80, would not be able to
control the many political pressures he will face in the job.</TE>
<TE>   With the end of the loya jirga, the delegates will scatter to
towns and villages across Afghanistan, taking home with them their
impressions and frustrations over the country's first experiment with
democracy in more than 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   By the most generous of readings, the conference left many
delegates disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   Although they might have had unrealistic expectations coming in,
given the difficulties of having such a large group take a hands-on
role in choosing a Cabinet, they appeared to be leaving with a sense
of having been cheated of their main job of designing the new
government.</TE>
<TE>   They had little say in the Cabinet's composition and left without
having agreed on the shape of a national assembly, a crucial body for
those who want to ensure that the executive branch's power can be
kept in check.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the delegates were not even able to resolve the
composition of the group to make the decision about whether to create
a parliament with legislative powers or a national shura, or council,
that would have a more advisory role.</TE>
<TE>   Most worrisome to many was the legitimizing of several of the
warlords who had caused havoc in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "It's OK if [the Cabinet] is decided in the palace, but the
discussions that are going on are with the warlords and the normal
people have no access to them," said Abdul Salam Rahimi, a member of
the committee that set up the loya jirga.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a strong parliament; I don't know why Karzai avoids
that," said Zalmal, a delegate from the northern city of
Mazar-i-Sharif who, like many Afghans, goes by one name.</TE>
<TE>   "We are here to ensure the future of the nation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the focus Wednesday was on the Cabinet because it will
shape the policies and set the tone of the nascent government.
Karzai's government will be judged as much on whether the ethnically
diverse Afghans perceive it as fair as on its achievements. The
inclusion of warlords is particularly problematic in terms of his
credibility as a new kind of leader.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives the impression to the people that the warlords are
running things," said Arsala, the outgoing finance minister.</TE>
<TE>   Arsala is being replaced by Ashref Ghani, a close friend of the
new president. Ghani has been one of Karzai's most visible advocates
in recent months and is one of the few appointees with expertise in
his field: He is a former official with the World Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai went out of his way to justify his choices, attempting to
distinguish between warlords and moujahedeen, holy fighters who
struggled to free Afghanistan from Russian dominance.</TE>
<TE>   "When we say warlordism, there should be a difference between
moujahed and warlord," Karzai told the delegates. "The moujahed gave
his blood for his nation. The whole nation should respect the
moujahed."</TE>
<TE>   Distinctions between the two blurred in the early 1990s, with many
moujahedeen joining the bloody and chaotic fight for control of the
country that ruined the lives of tens of thousands of Afghans.</TE>
<TE>   Also appointed to Karzai's Cabinet was one woman, Dr. Suhaila
Seddiqi, who will head the Public Health Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   A number of other ministers have yet to be named, but Karzai is
expected to complete the process by Saturday.</TE>

<LD>JERUSALEM -- The Israeli army planted mobile homes and water tanks in
the West Bank city of Jenin on Wednesday, the first sign of the
government's potentially far-reaching plan to capture and keep
Palestinian territory in response to acts of terror.</LD>
<LD>   Other than the Jenin maneuvers, however, it remained wholly
unclear how the new policy will play out.</LD>
<LD>   Announced dramatically in the middle of the night, the shift could
send thousands of Israeli troops back into West Bank cities in roles
not seen in nearly a decade. Or steps could be taken more gradually,
raising minimal international protest but assuaging an Israeli public
demanding revenge and safety.</LD>
<TE>   The government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, responding to a bus
bombing Tuesday that was the deadliest Palestinian attack in
Jerusalem in six years, announced it would seize swaths of
Palestinian-controlled land after each new suicide bombing--and would
hold the territory "until terror stops."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's suicide bombing, which prompted Sharon's new policy, was
followed by another Wednesday; the two bombers killed 26 people in 36
hours.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to get into every town, every place where terrorists are
being prepared to be suicide bombers," Communications Minister Reuven
Rivlin said Wednesday night. "We will be, at every moment, in the
cities when and where we want."</TE>
<TE>   Taken to its fullest extent, Sharon's announcement raises the
specter of a large-scale, open-ended Israeli takeover of the West
Bank. Such a move would represent another nail in the coffin of the
landmark and now moribund 1993 Oslo peace accords, which launched the
hand-over of land to Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Reoccupation would also represent another step in dismantling the
already battered Palestinian Authority headed by Yasser Arafat and
established by the Oslo agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Rivlin said a throwback to a pre-Oslo state of affairs was in fact
desirable. When Israeli troops patrolled the streets of Palestinian
cities, or controlled most aspects of Palestinian life, intelligence
was better and terror attacks could be kept at a minimum, Rivlin
argued.</TE>
<TE>   But deploying Israeli troops on a large scale also exposes them to
greater harm. Although Palestinian gunmen have only rarely confronted
Israeli tanks and armor head-on, they would be faced with a tempting
abundance of targets.</TE>
<TE>   And many Israelis have little stomach for permanent reoccupation,
because it would eventually imply providing services for more than 3
million Palestinians, a costly endeavor.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not our intent to move in and reoccupy permanently," said
another government spokesman, Daniel Seaman. "This is deterrent and
strategic.... It is punitive. We want them to understand the
consequences of reoccupation. They have to understand they will lose
everything they have achieved."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said Wednesday that
he opposes retaking Palestinian-controlled territories on a permanent
basis, but he said the army will stay in some areas for "a week, two
weeks or three."</TE>
<TE>   The Oslo peace process gave Palestinians full or partial autonomy
over large portions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which were
captured by Israel during the 1967 Middle East War. But the land is
in chunks that are chopped up by scores of Jewish settlements and
Israeli-controlled roads connecting them. The Palestinians had hoped
to eventually build a sovereign state on less truncated territory.</TE>
<TE>   In most of the last 21 months of conflict, Israel has insisted it
had no intention of reoccupying Palestinian land. A five-week
offensive launched in late March after a suicide bombing killed 29
Israelis sent troops into almost every Palestinian city, but the army
always said the action was temporary. In the weeks since, troops have
staged regular raids in Palestinian towns but have always withdrawn
fairly quickly.</TE>
<TE>   If the army now takes up permanent positions inside Palestinian
towns, another threshold will have been crossed in the conflict--a
step taken that was unimaginable two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In reality though, the lines designating Palestinian control have
already been blurred.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army has made it clear it would enter
Palestinian-ruled areas at will in the pursuit of potential suicide
bombers, militants and other enemies. The army chief of staff, Lt.
Gen. Shaul Mofaz, said he no longer recognized so-called Area A, land
under full Palestinian authority as established by the Oslo accords.
Many West Bank cities and towns remain surrounded by troops or barbed
wire. On any given day, most Palestinians have to cross Israeli
military roadblocks to travel from one town to the next, where work
or school may await. Palestinians were already complaining that their
land had been reoccupied.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials said Israel's announcement continued what
they maintain has been Sharon's master plan all along: to seize and
subjugate the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Several said "all resistance"
is now justified.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels like the occupation is already back," Jamal Shati, a
Palestinian legislator, said from Jenin, ticking off the buildings
that troops were moving into Wednesday, in addition to the trailers.</TE>
<TE>   Added Palestinian Labor Minister Ghassan Khatib: "Sharon intends
to institute a functional division of the West Bank, with Israel in
charge of security all over it and the Palestinians in charge of
Palestinian civilians all over it."</TE>
<TE>   By announcing the new policy, Sharon may also be attempting to
appease an increasingly vociferous right wing that dominates his
government and is urging drastic measures, including the expulsion
not only of Arafat but of all of the Palestinian leadership.</TE>
<TE>   There is a fair amount of frustration over the seemingly futile
battle to stop terrorism. Despite the five-week West Bank offensive,
in which thousands of Palestinians were arrested, and the daily,
shorter raids--as well as intense police surveillance in Jerusalem
and other cities--attacks on Israelis inside their nation's pre-1967
borders continue.</TE>
<TE>   Israel began in recent days to build a wall between itself and
portions of the West Bank to stop attacks. Now Sharon threatens to
capture Palestinian land with the same goal in mind. His right-wing
ministers were delighted and embraced the decision; members of his
government from the more moderate Labor Party, however, expressed
serious reservations.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only will this decision fail to prevent terrorism, it will in
fact step up terrorism," said Haim Ramon, a Labor legislator who is
not a member of Sharon's Cabinet. "The Israeli government's new
policy will lead in the end to recapturing all the territory ...
turning the clock back by 30 years."</TE>

<HD>Hope Flickering for Palestinian Peace-Seekers</HD>
<DH>Society: Anger fills hearts of moderates who used to build
bridges with their Israeli neighbors. Support for the use of violence
against the occupation grows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>The months of violent confrontations in the Mideast have left many
moderate Palestinians, key to any renewal of a meaningful peace
process, embittered, politically weakened and less willing to
compromise.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinians who have met with Israelis for years in grass-roots
peace efforts say they cannot do so now, after Israel's West Bank
offensive, and with the government's declaration Wednesday that it
will recapture Palestinian-held lands and keep them indefinitely.</LD>
<LD>   "I am too angry now, and my heart is too full," said Fadwa abu
Laban, 36, a coordinator for Palestinian women's issues in Bethlehem
who has taken part in dialogue sessions with Israelis for more than a
decade. "I cannot think about contacting people on the other side."</LD>
<TE>   Even those who remain open to meetings with Israelis say it is
hard now to express such views in public. Recent polls show
Palestinians increasingly supporting violence over talks as the way
to end the Israeli occupation and achieve political goals.</TE>
<TE>   "For a time, people like me could sell our views of a peaceful
resolution," said Manuel Hassassian, a Bethlehem University political
scientist who has met frequently with Israeli officials over the
years. "But how can you keep talking about peace when everyone around
you is in a mood for war?"</TE>
<TE>   Israel launched the massive sweep through the West Bank in March
after a series of deadly Palestinian attacks on Israelis. The
offensive formally ended last month when the army withdrew from
Bethlehem, one of six Palestinian cities it had reoccupied. But
tensions remain high, with almost daily Israeli incursions into
Palestinian areas to hunt for militants.</TE>
<TE>   And on Wednesday, the day after a suicide bomber in Jerusalem
killed 19 people besides himself, the Israeli government announced
that it will seize Palestinian territory and stay there "as long as
terror continues."</TE>
<TE>   For 21 months, since the beginning of the Palestinian uprising,
Israelis and Palestinians have fought each other in an
all-but-declared war. Palestinian suicide bombers blow themselves up
in malls, markets and buses, killing and wounding Israeli civilians.
Israel responds with raids into West Bank communities, and
Palestinian civilians are injured and killed.</TE>
<TE>   But the toll from the mounting violence now seems likely to reach
beyond each society's grief over its latest victims and shock at the
scope of the destruction. What is at risk, many say, is the hope of
reaching a real peace for the foreseeable future, as moderates on
both sides lose faith.</TE>
<TE>   Many Palestinians who believed most strongly in the land-for-peace
deals at the heart of the defunct Oslo accords are now the most
bitter at their failure. They are disillusioned that the years of
negotiations produced neither peace nor an end to the occupation. And
they are angry over Israel's reentry into Palestinian-held areas.</TE>
<TE>   Some express a sense of almost personal betrayal.</TE>
<TE>   What "has been destroyed in this [Israeli] campaign is people like
me, the Palestinian peace camp," Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian Cabinet
minister and senior peace negotiator, said. "You can rebuild a school
or a water or sewage network. But how do you rebuild hope in the
minds of the people?"</TE>
<TE>   A former political science professor who is a member of the
Palestinian parliament, Erekat said he is now so associated with the
failure of the Oslo talks that "people want me to go home."</TE>
<TE>   He predicted that if the Palestinians were to hold elections now,
he would get far fewer votes than the 58% he won in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "People like me, we're the liberal middle class. Who believes us
any more?" Erekat said. Eight years ago, Erekat said, he persuaded
his daughter, then 12, to join Seeds of Peace, the program to help
children from conflict-ridden regions learn to live together. Now, he
sometimes wonders, to what end?</TE>
<TE>   The majority of the West Bank remains under Israeli control, as it
has since 1967. Under the Oslo process, Israel transferred authority
over the big cities and nearby villages to the Palestinians but kept
most of the land, including roads, water sources, Jewish settlements
and military bases. After years of incremental progress, Erekat
asked, "Am I going to find out that all I've done is reorganize the
Israeli occupation?"</TE>
<TE>   The months of renewed fighting have radicalized Palestinian
society, with polls showing declining support for the peace process.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, many more Palestinians now say they approve of the
use of violence against Israelis, even civilians. In a poll published
this month, 68% of those surveyed said they supported suicide
bombings against Israeli civilians, up from about 26% three years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority has abandoned the position that negotiations are the
most effective means" to end the occupation and achieve Palestinian
statehood, political analyst Khalil Shikaki said.</TE>
<TE>   The human bonds built up slowly, painfully, over many years are
fraying.</TE>
<TE>   A Palestinian association of nongovernmental organizations, for
instance, recently called on its 92 members to halt all joint
projects with Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   For those still willing to pursue such contacts, the logistical
challenges alone are enormous. New roadblocks, checkpoints and
unpredictable violence mean that Palestinians often cannot meet with
Israelis even when they want to.</TE>
<TE>   Other constraints are societal.</TE>
<TE>   "Some activists want to continue their work," said Akram Attallah,
who coordinates joint projects in the West Bank for a Norwegian
nongovernmental agency. "But on the Palestinian side, people define
you as a traitor now if you're working with Israelis."</TE>
<TE>   The hostility is so great, Attallah said, that even his own
children, influenced by the atmosphere at school, shocked their
parents recently by cheering when they heard of an attack inside
Israel. "We have had some debates about this in the family," he said.
"We don't want them to go this way."</TE>
<TE>   In the Dahaisha refugee camp on the southern outskirts of
Bethlehem, Fadwa and Saleh abu Laban have met frequently with
left-wing Israelis since 1991, when Saleh served as an advisor to the
Palestinian delegation at the Madrid peace conference.</TE>
<TE>   The Abu Labans have marched with Israelis in peace rallies, met
them in dialogue groups and hosted them in their home, a cinder-block
structure on one of the camp's narrow alleys. They came to think of a
few as friends, people who shared their vision of a peaceful Middle
East and of two states, Israel and Palestine, side by side.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in the wake of the Israeli offensive, including a
near-constant curfew in Bethlehem and recent incursions into the camp
itself, the Abu Labans say they feel angry and betrayed, not least by
their contacts on the Israeli left.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't do anything for us, to try to stop this situation,"
Fadwa said. "We don't make these meetings [with Israelis] just for
the social relations. We don't need the politics. We do it because we
think it helps us reach peace. But what did it do?"</TE>
<TE>   Saleh, 48, who served time in prison for an attack on Israeli
soldiers when he was 15, underwent a dramatic evolution as he reached
adulthood, becoming an outspoken advocate for a negotiated solution
to the conflict. But recent months have hardened his views.</TE>
<TE>   Today, he and his wife say they still believe in the
land-for-peace formula enshrined in the Oslo accords and will
continue to work with Israelis who share those goals. But, like many
Palestinians, Saleh these days also strongly defends what he calls
the Palestinian right to resist the Israeli occupation, by violence
if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a fundamental right under international law," he says,
cradling his 2-year-old son. "It shouldn't be looked at as a weird
idea to resist the occupation."</TE>
<TE>   The Abu Labans and other Palestinians also say they are
disillusioned at how the Oslo process worked, and at the prevailing
view, in Israel and the United States, that the Palestinians refused
an extraordinary offer at Camp David in July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Jerusalem was not solved, the refugee issue was not solved, the
settlements were not solved," Saleh said. "It did not give
Palestinians control of any borders.... The water underground would
not belong to the Palestinians, and the sky above would not. What
kind of state is that?"</TE>
<TE>   Across the sprawling camp, Mohammed Lahham, another former
prisoner and longtime peace advocate, was similarly despondent.</TE>
<TE>   Not long ago, during the Oslo process, peace seemed within reach,
said Lahham, head of popular committees for all West Bank refugee
camps. He worked hard to build a concept of peace in the camps,
teaching young Palestinians in particular about the longing for peace
that also exists in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   But now, he said, with radicalism on the rise, he expects more
attacks by Palestinians and more incursions by Israel. "We cannot
talk about peace in the near future," he said. "No one will listen."</TE>
<TE>   But even as most Palestinians take a step back from contacts with
Israelis, a few continue to reach out.</TE>
<TE>   Samia Khoury, 67, a longtime community volunteer from the
Jerusalem village of Beit Hanina, was overcome by tear gas fired by
Israeli soldiers recently as she and other Palestinians demonstrated
with Israeli activists at a checkpoint near her home.</TE>
<TE>   A board member of the Palestinian Christian group Sabeel, which
promotes nonviolent resistance to the occupation, Khoury said such
joint efforts are difficult now but have become even more essential.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all angry, we're all hurt now," she said. "But Israelis and
Palestinians, we're both victims of this occupation and we should not
be quiet. It is our voices, the peace voices, that should be heard."</TE>
<TE>   Khoury said she will continue to work with Israeli organizations
and to participate in the tiny demonstrations at the checkpoint.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, she said, Israelis and Palestinians "are destined to
live side by side. The Israelis are not going to transfer us
anywhere, and we're not going to throw them into the sea. The sooner
we resolve this, the more lives will be spared."</TE>
<TE>   Trounson was recently on assignment in Israel and the West Bank.

<HD>Role of U.S. to Grow in Hunt</HD>
<DH>Philippines: Training will increase and troops are to
engage in joint anti-rebel patrols, officials say. Mission still is
to end next month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has agreed to intensify U.S. military
operations in the Philippines by permitting American forces to join
in the hunt for Muslim guerrillas, but it has declined a request by
top generals to keep troops there beyond the end of July, defense
officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Americans are still constrained by a clause in the Philippine
Constitution that forbids foreign troops to engage in combat except
in self-defense. But they are at risk of coming under fire as they
patrol for members of the separatist group Abu Sayyaf, said defense
officials who asked not to be identified.</LD>
<LD>   The Green Berets will also begin instructing Philippine troops in
smaller groups than at the battalion level, permitting more intense
training than has been provided since the six-month exercise began in
February.</LD>
<TE>   Other details of the changes in the counter-terrorism training
mission on Basilan island are still being worked out in consultation
with members of Congress and the Philippine government.</TE>
<TE>   The change in ground rules was designed in part to satisfy
Philippine government and army officials who wanted the U.S. forces
to take a more direct role in the effort to track down Abu Sayyaf
rebels. President Bush approved the plan after a White House briefing
Tuesday, in keeping with the emerging administration policy of
preemptively striking potential terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Although the U.S. commander in the Pacific, Adm. Thomas Fargo, and
American commanders in the Philippines recommended an expanded
mission, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had said as recently as
last month that he wasn't yet convinced of the need. But Rumsfeld
recommended the changes after Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D.
Wolfowitz visited U.S. troops on the ground and filed his own report,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "The I's aren't all dotted and the Ts aren't all crossed yet, but
there is an agreement," a senior defense official said, also speaking
on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The change in policy will increase the American military presence
in the Philippines by no more than 60 troops, the Pentagon said.
There are nearly 1,000 U.S. troops in the region, including more than
600 Special Forces soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Although the advisory mission of the Special Forces troops will
end in July, other security assistance will probably continue, one
Pentagon official said. Details of that assistance remain murky.</TE>
<TE>   Long before Sept. 11, the Pentagon maintained close ties and
conducted training missions with the Philippine military. That
included training and equipping a light-reaction company of 80 to 100
Philippine soldiers, modeled after the U.S. Delta Force, to go after
the Abu Sayyaf. The U.S. had agreed before the current advisory
mission to train two more companies, and the Pentagon is asking
Congress to fund the program.</TE>
<TE>   The mission takes place in a war zone, including regions the
Philippine government does not control. Basilan island is home to up
to 100 Abu Sayyaf guerrillas, who have been linked to Osama bin
Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Marines exchanged fire with guerrillas on Basilan for the
first time Monday. There were no U.S. casualties, and a search of the
jungle area afterward found no evidence of rebel casualties.</TE>

<HD>Hungary Prime Minister Admits and Defends His Former Spy
Life</HD>
<DH>Europe: Medgyessy acknowledges that he worked for the
Communist secret service--but only against the Soviets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY and PALMA MELIS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BUDAPEST, Hungary</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Peter Medgyessy admitted Wednesday that he was a
counter-espionage officer for the former Communist secret service but
portrayed his work as aimed against Soviet intelligence in defense of
Hungarian interests.</LD>
<LD>   "I helped prevent foreign spies from getting their hands on
Hungarian secrets and ensured they should not be able to block our
joining the IMF [International Monetary Fund]," Medgyessy told
parliament Wednesday. "I would like to emphasize that a spy-catcher
is not an agent, not an informant. Counterintelligence and
intelligence are ancient professions and serve to protect the
country."</LD>
<LD>   An ex-Communist and former banker, Medgyessy, 59, said his
counterintelligence work from 1977 to 1982 was part of his job in the
Finance Ministry's international department.</LD>
<TE>   During that period, Medgyessy was part of a team that secretly
negotiated Hungary's joining the IMF in 1982, seen at the time as a
bold anti-Soviet step. Moscow had blocked Hungary when it tried to
join the Western-dominated body in the early 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Medgyessy also said in parliament Wednesday that keeping
Communist-era records secret has made it possible for them to be used
selectively for "political blackmail." To eliminate this problem, he
said, he will submit an emergency bill to release classified secret
service data about politicians.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would allow the publication of the names of all
police informers involved in domestic surveillance activities, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The prime minister's explanations and support for opening up
secret police files appeared to deflect efforts by some politicians
within his ruling coalition to force his resignation.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition of the Hungarian Socialist Party and the Alliance of
Free Democrats holds 198 seats in the 386-seat parliament, which
means Medgyessy's hold on office depends on maintaining firm support
within those two parties.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty-four hours ago, the majority of the Free Democrats had not
voted confidence, but today they did," said Gabor Kuncze, the party's
leader. "The Wednesday morning speech of the prime minister cleared
his past.... Based on the knowledge we have at this time, we consider
the matter closed. There is no coalition crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Opposition Still Objects</TE>
<TE>   But Zoltan Pokorni, leader in parliament of the main opposition
FiDeSz-Hungarian Civic Party, said Medgyessy "cannot be Hungary's
prime minister.... The Hungarian Socialist Party and the Alliance of
Free Democrats are trying to save that which cannot be saved."</TE>
<TE>   Magyar Nemzet, the newspaper that on Tuesday revealed Medgyessy's
counter-espionage role, published a new allegation Wednesday that he
had also spied on colleagues at the Finance Ministry--a charge the
prime minister immediately denied.</TE>
<TE>   Through a spokesman, Medgyessy said that a document published to
back up the domestic spying charge is a forgery and that he will sue
the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   The allegedly forged document includes a signature in Medgyessy's
name and states, "We examined the probability of who might become
involved in possible counterrevolutionary activity and who might be
potential leaders of such activities." It says that at the Finance
Ministry and National Savings Bank, 28 people were categorized as
"dangerous," 20 as "must be watched" and eight as "must be
dismissed."</TE>
<TE>   Were the charge to prove true despite the prime minister's swift
denial, it could be more damaging than the revelation that Medgyessy
engaged in counter-espionage work, for domestic informers were
intensely disliked.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in the middle of a very dirty political game, and the
present government should not tolerate it," Kuncze said. The proposed
changes to laws on secret service records would "prevent any further
misuse of these by politically motivated parties," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on television Wednesday evening, Socialist Party chief
Laszlo Kovacs charged that the allegations had been raised to divert
public attention from corruption investigations launched by the new
government.</TE>
<TE>   Kovacs said that when the Free Democrats were wavering on whether
to support Medgyessy, he warned them "not to have illusions."</TE>
<TE>   "If Medgyessy resigned, the opposition would attack the next prime
minister too," Kovacs said. "I say about myself that there is nothing
in my past for which I could be accused, but if the opposition forges
something against me, as they did today with Medgyessy, and they
repeat it eight or 10 times, perhaps that would get on my nerves
too."</TE>
<TE>   Security Work a Taboo</TE>
<TE>   Many anti-Communist Hungarians view a history of any kind of
security work for the Communist government as unacceptable, partly
because it is seen as having involved collaboration with the Soviet
Union, which brutally crushed a 1956 democratic revolution here.</TE>
<TE>   Medgyessy worked in Hungary's former Communist government during
its waning years in the 1980s as finance minister and deputy prime
minister. He was finance minister again from 1996 to 1998 under a
government led by the Socialists, who picked him as their candidate
for prime minister in April parliamentary elections even though he
has never joined the party.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout much of the former Soviet bloc, there have been
repeated controversies in the past decade about how to best deal with
current-day politicians who have a record of cooperation with secret
service agencies. Several countries have screening laws. Details and
punishments vary, but their essence is to make it difficult for at
least some categories of former secret service employees to hold
office.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Demands Immunity for Its Peacekeepers</HD>
<DH>Justice: Washington tells the U.N. it will not participate
in missions unless Americans are protected from trials at new
international court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Continuing its campaign against the new International Criminal Court,
the United States declared Wednesday that it would no longer
participate in U.N. peacekeeping missions unless the Security Council
granted the troops permanent immunity from prosecution by the
tribunal.</LD>
<LD>   Such assurances are highly unlikely, given the strong support for
the court by even staunch U.S. allies--and given their concern that a
blanket exemption for peacekeepers could fatally undermine the
tribunal's authority.</LD>
<LD>   The United States is virtually alone on the council in its
opposition to the court, which has been ratified by 67 U.N. member
states--including all the countries of the European Union--and comes
into effect July 1.</LD>
<TE>   But political and financial backing from Washington is generally
deemed essential for the success of U.N. peacekeeping operations, and
several council members privately expressed dismay at the U.S. move.</TE>
<TE>   "This go-it-alone attitude is bad for the U.S. reputation here,"
said one European diplomat, who asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   Two Resolutions Offered</TE>
<TE>   Only about 700 U.S. citizens--none of them combat troops--are
serving in peacekeeping missions under direct U.N. control. But
thousands of U.S. troops are deployed in American-led but
U.N.-endorsed peacekeeping operations, and Washington is seeking
exemptions from international prosecutions for these and similar
deployments in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the whole spectrum of United Nations peacekeeping
operations will have to be reviewed if we are unsuccessful at getting
the protections we demand," Richard S. Williamson, a U.S. diplomat
here, told reporters Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In two draft resolutions presented to the council Wednesday, the
United States outlined the specific legal guarantees it seeks before
committing military or civilian personnel to U.N.-authorized
peacekeeping operations.</TE>
<TE>   Participants in all U.N.-backed missions would enjoy "immunity
from arrest, detention and prosecution with respect to all acts
arising out of the operation, and this immunity shall continue after
termination of their participation in the operation," states the text
of one of the resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   Of greater immediate consequence for the council, the second
proposed U.S. resolution would append similar guarantees to the
renewal of the U.N. mandate for the peacekeeping force in Bosnia-
Herzegovina, which is due to be approved here this week. The
resolution extending the Bosnian mission would apply both to a U.N.
police training program there and to the NATO-led troops--including
2,500 Americans--who are charged with enforcing the Dayton peace
accords.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration fears that the court could be used for
politically motivated prosecutions of U.S. troops and diplomats
abroad. The proposed U.S. amendment would prohibit the "surrender or
transfer" of any current or former member of the U.N.-backed forces
in Bosnia to any "international tribunal, for any purpose."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, U.S. Ambassador John D. Negroponte offered a similar
amendment to a council motion extending the U.N.-backed peacekeeping
mission in East Timor. But the U.S. proposal was withdrawn after it
failed to win support from any of the other 14 council members. Nine
votes are needed to pass a council resolution.</TE>
<TE>   No U.S. troops are deployed in East Timor, and Negroponte said the
United States would have pursued the matter more forcefully if
American forces were involved.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make clear that when we participate in peacekeeping
missions, we intend to seek some kind of exception to the
International Criminal Court's jurisdiction," Negroponte said later.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Widely Criticized</TE>
<TE>   The International Criminal Court is empowered to prosecute war
crimes, acts of genocide and other crimes against humanity committed
after July 1, but only if the country where the accused is a citizen
or resident is judged unwilling or unable to bring the case before a
domestic court.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the Bush administration was roundly criticized by
allies here when it annulled the Clinton administration's signature
on the treaty creating the court. No other U.N. member state has
publicly repudiated the treaty. China and Singapore are the only
other non-signatories on the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   "We've invited input from others, but the bottom line is that the
United States will not endanger U.S. citizens by putting them in the
reach of an ICC treaty that we have not agreed to," Williamson said
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Congress, meanwhile, is close to adopting legislation that would
require prior exemptions from International Criminal Court
prosecution before the Defense Department sends troops on
peacekeeping missions abroad.</TE>
<TE>   The American Servicemembers' Protection Act adopted by the Senate
two weeks ago would also ban all U.S. "cooperation" with the
International Criminal Court, including providing evidence or
witnesses in war crimes prosecutions, and cut off military aid to all
court signatories except for North Atlantic Treaty Organization
nations, Taiwan and other unspecified "major non-NATO allies."</TE>
<TE>   But unlike the House, which passed an almost identical bill, the
Senate gave the president the power to waive the act's provisions and
commit troops to peacekeeping missions without guaranteed protection
from the new court.</TE>

<HD>Suicide Attacks Put Brakes on Bush's Plan</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: The U.S. is reviewing its idea of an interim
Palestinian state in light of the violence and the initial Mideast
reaction to the concept.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush's proposal to jump-start the deadlocked
Middle East peace process was put on hold Wednesday, as the White
House acknowledged that the plan is becoming a victim of the new
spate of suicide bombings.</LD>
<LD>   The president had been expected to call for creation of an interim
Palestinian state in a midweek speech. But two deadly suicide
bombings in Israel in less than two days, as well as the initial
reaction from Middle East leaders to Bush's idea, have sparked
further scrutiny of the concept and its key details by the
administration, according to U.S. officials.</LD>
<LD>   Bush met Wednesday with his top national security team for further
discussions on the plan, the officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's obvious that the immediate aftermath [of the suicide
bombings] is not the right time" to unveil the peace plan, White
House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said. "The president wants to
give a speech at a time when it will have the maximum impact to bring
the maximum prospects for peace to the region, and the president will
make that determination about what that time is."</TE>
<TE>   Bush could still give the speech within the next few days,
possibly Monday, administration sources said. But there is a
possibility that he will wait until after a summit in Canada next
week of the Group of 8 major industrialized nations, U.S. officials
said. Waiting until after the G-8 would give Bush a chance to discuss
his plan privately with key allies at the meeting--and perhaps gain
their support for it.</TE>
<TE>   The major factor determining the speech's timing might be what
happens in the region in the next few days. Israel has asked for at
least a temporary end to the violence before the United States makes
any move, according to U.S. and Middle East officials.</TE>
<TE>   The latest attacks have had "a big effect" on Bush, said a
well-placed U.S. official who requested anonymity. "In the wake of
the bombings, he's coming out more forcefully on Israel's behalf."</TE>
<TE>   The language from the White House on Wednesday reflected Bush's
deep anger and frustration with the Palestinian Authority and its
failure to rein in extremists, particularly among its own factions,
officials added.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the time to be doing anything that could possibly be
interpreted as a reward for the Palestinians' behavior, because they
continue to fail at their basic assignment to curtail the violence,"
said the well-placed source.</TE>
<TE>   The White House had been calling on Israel to curtail the military
crackdown it launched in Palestinian areas of the West Bank this
year. But on Wednesday, following Tuesday's bombing of a bus in
Jerusalem that killed the attacker and 19 other people, the
administration expressed its understanding of Israel's retaliatory
policy that included seizing additional Palestinian territory.</TE>
<TE>   "The president understands Israel's right to self-defense,
particularly in the wake of an attack of this severity," Fleischer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the administration was drawing up details for a peace
plan that called for creating an interim Palestinian state as a
preliminary step to a permanent one.</TE>
<TE>   The latest draft of the proposal calls for creating a state with
"provisional" borders. It could be declared this year or early next
year, depending on how quickly Palestinians moved to improve security
in the region and adopt political reforms, administration officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Discussing the change in phrasing and other details of the plan, a
State Department official said: "To call it an interim state lends
the air of officialdom and seems to bless the usual suspects who are
likely to be put in positions of authority."</TE>
<TE>   The timing for creation of the new state would be
"performance-driven," said an administration official who requested
anonymity. Once declared, the state would then engage in negotiations
with Israel on the thorny issues of final borders, control of
Jerusalem and the return of Palestinian refugees.</TE>
<TE>   The administration hopes that political reforms will open up a
Palestinian system that has been dominated by Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat and bring new faces into government who are
more willing to take the tough decisions needed to make a final peace
with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   A major issue Bush discussed Wednesday with his national security
team was whether to propose a timeline for a final settlement,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian mediator Nabil Shaath, who met with National Security
Council and State Department officials this week, proposed one year
of negotiations and one year of implementation.</TE>
<TE>   Israel wants no deadlines and a step-by-step approach that does
not begin until its security is guaranteed.</TE>
<TE>   The White House is also still working on the issue of final
borders--and how to deal with the demand by Palestinians and their
supporters in the Arab world that the eventual state include all land
Israel occupied during the 1967 Middle East War and still holds, with
only slight modifications. In the current political climate, that
would almost certainly be rejected by the more conservative elements
in Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's Cabinet and Likud Party.</TE>
<TE>   Shaath indicated Wednesday that the Palestinians might reject a
proposal that does not hold out the prospect of an eventual state
that extends the current territory under control of the Palestinian
Authority--roughly 40% of the West Bank and two-thirds of the Gaza
Strip--to all of the land conquered in the 1967 war.</TE>

<LD>Re "Farmers Oppose Call to Idle Land," June 17: When Imperial
Irrigation District board member Bruce Kuhn described U.S. Sen.
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) as a "bureaucratic gasbag, pig-eyed sack
of crap," I discounted his comments as an unnecessary and crude
diatribe. Then I saw Kuhn's picture--standing in one of his alfalfa
fields--on an inside page. Taking in his arms-folded-over-his-chest
posture and his ample belly protruding over his belt, I concluded
that his ill-advised comments about Feinstein might have more
fittingly been directed at himself.</LD>
<LD>   But the incident might help us focus on the problem that Feinstein
alluded to: a water shortage in California that will make today's
energy shortages seem insignificant. The senator's recommendation
that a part of the Imperial County farmers' water be sold to San
Diego County's residents addresses only a tiny part of the problem.
We need to tackle this monumental problem--the absolute necessity for
life-giving water in California. Tempus fugit.</LD>

<LD>Re "U.S. Weighs Risk of Smallpox, and Risk of Smallpox Vaccine," June
16: There is no perfect vaccine. If one compares the effects of
smallpox (15% to 40% death rate) with the risk of the vaccine (an
estimated one or two deaths per million of those vaccinated) there is
hardly a question about choice. Smallpox is not pleasant. The virus
spreads to all organs and there is considerable suffering on the part
of the patient.</LD>
<LD>   Eradication of the disease (1977) resulted from a World Health
Organization program to vaccinate all susceptible individuals,
thereby breaking the chain of transmission. I recall being vaccinated
as a child and every time I traveled overseas. It was a routine and
required vaccination, eliminating the potential for contracting a
very serious disease, and there was little discussion about potential
side effects.</LD>
<LD>   We immunize against measles, polio, chicken pox and other
diseases. Occasionally there are side effects. The virulence of these
diseases pales beside that of smallpox. If we are willing to
vaccinate after a potential bioterrorism attack, why not now?
Prevention is easier than trying to stop the spread of the disease in
a population.</LD>

<LD>Re "While We Were Sleeping," editorial, June 17: My family has been
in the U.S. for four or more generations. My heritage is entirely
Northern European. I am a 46-year-old female--almost an adult when
Title IX was passed in the early '70s. I have no soccer-playing
children. But I have been a World Cup soccer fan for nearly 30 years.
When I was 18, my best friend and I toured Europe by train. We were
in various parts of Germany during the last week of the World Cup and
watched the games with the Germans in various pubs. We got to
Munich--site of the final game--one week after the Germans defeated
the Dutch for the World Cup title. The Germans were still partying. I
love a good beer and a good time. This was a great event.</LD>
<LD>   In the early 1980s, I played a couple of years in a women's soccer
league. And every four years, I watch as many games as I can--doesn't
matter who's playing. The games are usually very exciting, because
anything can happen at any time. What ultimately attracts me is that
all the world is united over the same fun event.</LD>
<TE>   I can't believe I'm unique. So when you generalize about
"nonimmigrant Laker and Dodger fans" and "the Americans originally
from Honduras, Argentina, El Salvador, Iran, Pakistan--and yes,
Mexico," please remember this tall, blond, middle-aged, nonimmigrant
soccer fan. The World Cup has that kind of power, and every four
years a few more people like me realize that.</TE>

<TE>   I am a big soccer fan. I have been thrilled by the progress made
by the U.S. team and wish it well. Mexico and Mexicans showed class
by their gracious and nonbitter acceptance of the game's outcome. I
saw some man-in-the-street interviews with people in Mexico, and they
were also mature and gracious about the game. They congratulated the
American team and wished it well against Germany.</TE>

<TE>   Thank you for your editorial on the U.S. team's win and advancing
to the quarterfinals. As a U.S. citizen of Mexican descent and an
ardent soccer fan, I agonized over who would end up the victor
between Mexico and the U.S. I'd hoped that the game would go into
overtime and then kicks from the penalty spot, but then again, I was
very happy for the U.S. and sad for my Mexico. It is a feeling very
difficult to describe.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, I would have to take issue with your statement that
the U.S. "prowess is testament to the American Youth Soccer
Organization and other leagues." Why? Although AYSO has been around
since the late 1970s, it is the "other leagues," specifically the
U.S. Youth Soccer Assn., which outnumbers AYSO, that field more
competitive club teams and have produced many quality players, as
opposed to the recreationally oriented AYSO.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the members of the U.S. team got their start in club
soccer and, yes, I must agree, some with AYSO. But credit needs to be
given where credit is due: to the U.S. Youth Soccer Assn.'s club
soccer system--urban and suburban, ethnic and not--that has produced
and will continue to produce many of the members of the U.S. teams,
male or female.</TE>

<TE>   Day after day you publish 20 inches of copy on the front page on
sports. On June 18 it was soccer. The continuous tabloidization of
The Times is most depressing, especially as you minimize the coverage
of the Enron scandal, our economic problems, environmental disasters
and the Bush administration's complicity in the failure to discover
the 9/11 attacks, etc.</TE>
<TE>   Our society is already obsessed with sports; the average U.S. male
can name more NFL quarterbacks than he can name members of the U.S.
Senate. You are making a major contribution to the dumbing down of
our populace.</TE>

<LD>Re "District's Bathroom Brouhaha," June 18: As a parent of three
children attending LAUSD schools, I am appalled! Private bathrooms
for school board members? So they don't get lobbied or spoken to by
the public (their constituents) on their way to the restroom down the
hall ... so they can "have a moment" or because such things are de
rigueur in Los Angeles? What hogwash!</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the board would like to try the restrooms that most Los
Angeles Unified School District teachers and administrators use. Or
for that matter, "take a moment" in the bathrooms at many of the high
schools in the district. If, according to Anne Valenzuela Smith, the
district's executive administrator for business issues, the members
need "personal space," how does the board suppose a teacher with 38
students feels?</LD>
<LD>   When will the board realize what its real priorities should be?
How many textbooks would one bathroom buy? I don't dispute that board
members should have comfortable and efficient work spaces; I only
wonder why our teachers and students don't deserve the same.</LD>

<TE>   As a 24-year veteran of the LAUSD, your article sickened me.
However, I will not be able to regurgitate today in private, as our
esteemed leaders would be able to do in their private bathrooms. I
will be fortunate to find an empty, fully stocked bathroom with no
waiting line at my year-round elementary school, where we have only
six toilets for a faculty and staff of over 100 to use in a 20-minute
break. These six toilets are also used by a large contingent of
parents as well as the staff of the LA's BEST after-school program
and LAUSD site construction workers.</TE>
<TE>   The article also states that a plan is under consideration to buy
or build more parking space for the new district headquarters.
Appalling, when one realizes that my school has no parking lot and
everyone must park up to two blocks away, subjecting our cars to
vandalism and ticketing due to restricted parking. Another example of
the haves and have-nots in the LAUSD.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, the board is taking care of its own elite before
taking care of the basic needs of its underlings. It is deplorable
and unconscionable for it to allocate moneys for private bathrooms
and parking garages when we are working under a severe budget crisis.</TE>

<LD>Re "Relief in Sight for Sleep- Deprived Medical Residents," June 13:
I am a second-year resident physician at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center
in Torrance. Over the past two years, I have learned time and time
again that long hours are bad medicine. I've made patient-care
mistakes after being up for 24-plus hours; I've fallen asleep while
talking with my patients; I've fallen asleep at stoplights while
driving home after long shifts.</LD>
<LD>   All doctors take an oath upon graduation from medical school to
"first, do no harm," but then we are thrust into a residency system
that often pushes us beyond our human limits, and harm is the result.
Harm to our patients' lives and harm in our own lives (car crashes,
pregnancy complications, needle sticks, depression). Resident
physicians are extremely dedicated individuals, but we are also human
beings. Something has to give way when the limits of human capacity
are exceeded (i.e., working for 36 hours straight every third night,
and 80-plus hours a week for 48-plus weeks of the year). Resident
well-being goes first, and the quality of patient care follows.</LD>
<LD>   Organized medicine has failed to monitor itself on this issue for
too long. It is time for legislation that will protect the health of
both patients and medical residents. It is time for legislation that
will enforce reasonable and safe resident physician work hours.</LD>

<HD>Ahmanson Study Gets Preliminary Approval</HD>
<DH>Development: Ventura County committee finds no serious
problems in the environmental analysis. Opponents will keep up the
pressure.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Washington Mutual Bank, developer of the Ahmanson Ranch housing
project, scored an early victory Wednesday when Ventura County
officials gave preliminary approval to an environmental study of the
3,050-home subdivision, the first of several steps before the
contentious issue returns to the Board of Supervisors for a final
vote.</LD>
<LD>   The county Environmental Report Review Committee unanimously
agreed there are no serious problems so far with the environmental
analysis.</LD>
<LD>   The study must be approved before the subdivision, on the eastern
edge of the county near Calabasas, can be built.</LD>
<TE>   Committee members directed the planning staff to begin responding
to 5,000 pages of comments received during the study's public review
period.</TE>
<TE>   When that is complete, the matter will return to the review
committee for a vote on the report's technical adequacy.</TE>
<TE>   Several other public hearings are expected in coming months as the
environmental document works its way to the Planning Commission and,
finally, the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, high-profile opponents are stepping up a
behind-the-scenes campaign to defeat the project.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood actor-director Rob Reiner lobbied Supervisor John Flynn
last week at the politician's Oxnard office.</TE>
<TE>   Reiner is chairman of Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch, a coalition of
celebrities, environmentalists, politicians and homeowners who oppose
the project.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn said the Friday meeting lasted about 20 minutes and that
Reiner outlined his reasons for opposing the project.</TE>
<TE>   Reiner also expressed his belief that Washington Mutual will
eventually bow to mounting pressure, abandon the project and sell the
chaparral-covered acreage for parkland, the supervisor said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Flynn said he was not pressed about how he would vote on
the project, he offered his opinion to Reiner anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "I explained that I voted for this project in 1992 and it would be
very difficult to change that position," said Flynn, who is seen as a
swing vote on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Reiner confirmed the meeting but said he won't
discuss whether the activist has had private sessions with other
supervisors who will be voting on the project, possibly by year's
end.</TE>
<TE>   "It is quite clear that the other side has hired teams of
lobbyists throughout the region," said spokesman Chad Griffin. "Rob
and other coalition members are doing what they can to make their
case."</TE>
<TE>   The project was approved by the Ventura County Board of
Supervisors 10 years ago, but construction was delayed by years of
litigation and the discoveries in 1999 of a rare flower and frog in
the rolling hills.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County ordered a follow-up environmental study. Released
in February, the report concluded the project would harm the
red-legged frog and the San Fernando spineflower but that safeguards
could reduce those effects to acceptable levels.</TE>
<TE>   The hearings being held now are to determine if the supplemental
environmental study should be approved. Although Wednesday's decision
was a setback for opponents, they vowed to keep the pressure on.</TE>
<TE>   "We are many months away from getting [the issue] before the Board
of Supervisors," Griffin said. "Our camp will move aggressively to
convince the Board of Supervisors and Ahmanson Ranch that it's not in
their interest to do this project."</TE>
<TE>   Ahmanson Ranch officials have said the 2,800-acre ranch property
is not for sale and that they intend to break ground next year.</TE>

<HD>Pair Urging L.A. Voice on Airport Board</HD>
<DH>Aviation: City Council members Greuel and LaBonge seek
their colleagues' backing for a representative on the Burbank panel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>City Councilwoman Wendy Greuel says it's only fair that Los Angeles
residents contending with airplane noise from Burbank Airport get a
representative on the airport's governing board.</LD>
<LD>   With that in mind, Greuel and Councilman Tom LaBonge have
introduced a motion before the Los Angeles City Council seeking
support to pursue the proposal before the nine-member
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority.</LD>
<LD>   "The residents of the city of Los Angeles have a lot to say about
what happens in the airport," Greuel said. "[They] talk a lot about
the flight patterns coming over their neighborhoods."</LD>
<TE>   The issue has come up before but has not gone far. In 1987, a Los
Angeles council committee opposed joining the Airport Authority based
on a recommendation from the city's chief legislative analyst, who
said that if the city joined the panel it could be held responsible
for the authority's debts or losses.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said the proposal is worthwhile despite past failures. She
said she has heard from numerous San Fernando Valley residents
frustrated by the noise of jets taking off over their neighborhoods.
If Los Angeles residents in neighborhoods such as North Hollywood,
Studio City and Sherman Oaks have to endure that type of daily
disruption, Greuel said, they should also have a hand in shaping the
airport's operations.</TE>
<TE>   And just being able to speak up at an authority meeting is not
enough, she said. "Of course, there's an open, public process, but
decisions are made by the authority. This is about having a say at
the table."</TE>
<TE>   The Airport Authority is made up of nine commissioners--three each
from Burbank, Pasadena and Glendale. The airport serves about 4.5
million travelers annually.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the authority's members say they are undecided on
whether Los Angeles should be represented on the panel but are
willing to listen to Greuel and LaBonge.</TE>
<TE>   Some members said they might be hesitant to change anything
because of the possibility the Valley may secede from Los Angeles,
changing the area's political makeup.</TE>
<TE>   "When the temperature comes down and the issues of seceding from
Los Angeles are in the history books, then I think we're probably in
a better place to begin this dialogue," said Chris Holden, a Pasadena
councilman and authority president.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Meseck, an authority commissioner from Glendale, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we're at a point where we can even discuss that.
It's related to the Valley and Valleyhood issues," he said. "They
need to resolve that first; then probably we're in a different
position."</TE>
<TE>   John Crowley, an airport commissioner from Pasadena, said he
wondered why Los Angeles would now want to be a member, considering
that years ago the city decided against it.</TE>
<TE>   "The city of Los Angeles people should be telling us why they feel
their voice should be heard now, when they had the opportunity before
and rejected it," Crowley said.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Lombardo, a Burbank commissioner, said he can't predict
how a Los Angeles resident might affect the authority's decisions
because Greuel and LaBonge have yet to clarify why they want a Los
Angeles resident to join the authority.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a whole lot of detail in what they requested,"
Lombardo said.</TE>

<HD>Audrey Skirball-Kenis, 87; Diverse Philanthropist, Patron
of the Theater</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Audrey Skirball-Kenis, a self-effacing daughter of privilege who
loved horse racing and steered millions of philanthropic dollars to
causes from the study of Jewish culture to the encouragement of new
playwrights, died early Wednesday. She was 87 and died of natural
causes, a spokeswoman for the family said.</LD>
<LD>   Born Audrey Marx and raised in New York as the daughter of a
banker, Skirball-Kenis moved to Southern California in the 1940s.
After two brief marriages and divorces, she wed developer, film
producer and philanthropist Jack Skirball, a union that lasted 38
years until his death in 1985.</LD>
<LD>   Together they developed plans for his grandest philanthropic
project, the construction of the Skirball Cultural Center above
Brentwood, which opened in 1996.</LD>
<TE>   "She had a verve and an imagination that were astounding," said
Uri D. Herscher, founding president and chief executive of the
center, who first met Skirball-Kenis in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   When Skirball-Kenis dropped by the center to visit, "she would
stop at every desk and have a conversation." Herscher said.</TE>
<TE>   When other philanthropists visit, he added, "that doesn't often
happen."</TE>
<TE>   The Skirball Center was in many ways her husband's project, funded
in large part through the New York-based foundation he created to
channel philanthropic efforts.</TE>
<TE>   But Herscher noted that its Jewish American emphasis very much
reflected her view of the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Audrey was a very proud American and a very proud person born of
the Jewish tradition, and she always felt that there was a remarkable
fit between the two, between democratic values and Jewish values," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   When the 1994 Northridge earthquake cut off power and telephone
connection to the Skirball-Kenis condominium in Century City,
Herscher recalled, Audrey, then 79, scared up a propane camp stove
and made pancakes.</TE>
<TE>   On a Caribbean cruise in 1996, the weather turned rough, the
swells grew, and "everyone on the ship was ill but Audrey," Herscher
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only did she not become ill or frightened, she tended to the
other five of us, and finished [reading] two novels."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 15 years, Herscher said, the Skirball Foundation's
gifts to the cultural center have totaled $60 million to $70 million.</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, she married Charles Kenis, an importer of French cognac
and wines.</TE>
<TE>   Together they operated the 3+U Stable Co., which included more
than two dozen horses. The couple frequently appeared at the Santa
Anita, Hollywood Park and Del Mar racetracks.</TE>
<TE>   Among Skirball-Kenis' other charitable involvements: the New York
University Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, the Los
Angeles Music Center and the Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew
Studies in England.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, as a trustee of the Skirball Foundation, she helped
direct more than $20 million to the A.S.K. Theater Projects, a
nonprofit organization created in 1989 to promote the creation and
production of new theatrical works. Among the many playwrights and
productions aided by Skirball-Kenis' largess were Tony Kushner's
"Angels in America" (winner of a 1993 Pulitzer Prize) and Suzan-Lori
Parks' "Topdog/Underdog" (winner of the 2002 Pulitzer).</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Davidson, artistic director/producer of the Center Theatre
Group (which operates the Ahmanson Theatre and Mark Taper Forum)
credited Skirball-Kenis for giving both generously and
efficiently--sending funds not only to individuals but to
institutions that could make room for new work.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the best kind of generosity. It was an endorsement of what
you were dreaming and imagining," Davidson said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles-based playwright David Rambo recalled that he was
still a moonlighting real estate agent when A.S.K. Theater Projects
began supporting his work in 1996. Since then, the organization has
played a role in six of his plays, through sponsored readings,
playwrights' retreats and other measures. The most recent work, still
in progress, is a commission for the Geffen Playhouse in Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   "Of all the things to do with money, to develop playwrights is
wonderfully mad," Rambo said. "It made the difference in my career.
It really did."</TE>
<TE>   Skirball-Kenis never worked in the theater, she told a Times
reporter in 1997, but from an early age she realized that "I was very
good at sitting in the back."</TE>
<TE>   She also sat on the board of the Los Angeles Opera. "She's been
part of this company since we began" in the 1980s, recalled Elizabeth
Kennedy, the opera's director of administration. "She was one of our
first million-dollar donors."</TE>
<TE>   Kym Eisner, executive director of A.S.K. Theater Projects,
described Skirball-Kenis as "elegantly bold, and she always spoke her
mind, in a gracious way. And she was absolutely beautiful. Gray hair,
blue eyes. She was probably about 5 feet tall, and thin.</TE>
<TE>   "She picked out flowers for the living room [the day before her
death]. They went to the market and picked flowers. Cream roses.
Yellow calla lilies and some stargazers lilies, and she arranged them
beautifully."</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Skirball Foundation gave $3 million in 1995 to see
the Geffen Playhouse through its fledgling years, remembered
producing director Gil Cates, "In all the shows that we've done here,
she never volunteered her opinion. But if I asked her, boy, she told
me. She liked unpretentious theater, theater that made you laugh or
cry, theater that she understood." Now, Cates said, "the theater is
going to miss her. I don't mean the Geffen, I mean the theater."</TE>
<TE>   Skirball-Kenis is survived by her husband; daughters, Sally and
Aggie, both of Southern California; and stepchildren, Stephen of
London and Andrea of Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Services will be held at 2 p.m. Sunday at Hillside Memorial Park
Chapel.</TE>

<HD>Home Depot in Capistrano? Council Leans Toward Asking
City's Voters</HD>
<DH>Election: Officials will decide July 2 whether to put the
disputed issue on the November ballot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>City Councilman Wyatt T. Hart faces a quandary and wants some
advice--yours, if you live in San Juan Capistrano.</LD>
<LD>   His financially pressed city would get a $9-million payday if it
sells Home Depot 13 acres on the southern edge of town. But to many,
the real estate deal would be another blow to its historic old-town
charm.</LD>
<LD>   Hart and his colleagues were close Tuesday night to placing the
issue on the November ballot and letting the voters sort things out.
The council will decide July 2 whether to let voters choose Home
Depot's fate.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not that we're weak, but everybody needs help now and then,"
Hart said.</TE>
<TE>   "An initiative would give us the help and the guidance we're
looking for."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman David M. Swerdlin said it would be appropriate to ask
residents: "Should we put a Home Depot in an area that is basically
out of sight and out of mind and derive a fairly sizable tax base
from that? Or do we look at Home Depot as something more suited to a
city than a small town?"</TE>
<TE>   In April, the council voted to begin negotiations to sell the land
on Stonehill Drive to the giant home improvement company. But there
was plenty of opposition.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,800 people signed a petition against the sale, saying it
would destroy the character of the town, which is built around its
200-year-old mission and 150-year-old adobes.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents worry that a "big box store" would bring road-clogging
traffic, pollute the air and block ocean breezes from a mobile-home
park for senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Heath, among the 400 who live at the Capistrano Valley Mobile
Estates, has been fighting for 15 years to keep Home Depot out of his
backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Heath's "No Home Depot" committee gathered the 1,800 signatures to
oppose the sale, but he never expected there might be a citywide
referendum.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we were stymied," he said. "It didn't seem like we were
getting anywhere. But maybe the little drops of water have finally
made a big puddle."</TE>
<TE>   City officials say the $9 million from the sale and the sales-tax
bonanza to follow would be a windfall.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have hotels like Dana Point and all these other
communities have," Hart said. "So we need the income. One police
officer costs $134,000 a year. We need more parks, there's water
issues, traffic problems, and we need to buy more open space."</TE>
<TE>   Hart said he would like the referendum written so the money is
earmarked for specific needs, such as buying open land to help
preserve the town's rustic feel, and easing any traffic problems
created by Home Depot.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hart favors the project, he's not sure the voters do.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here to serve the public," he said. "If the public says they
don't want it, it ain't going in. There's other things we could do
with that land. We could sell it for something else. But I'm sure we
would lose a lot of money."</TE>
<TE>   If the council calls for an election, Heath and other members of
his group say they will attempt to introduce voters to an alternative
to Home Depot--a 600-space RV and boat parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   "The city will get a lot of money from an RV park--maybe not as
much up front as with Home Depot," Heath said. "But the RV park
doesn't bring in the Big T, and that's traffic. And this way, the
city will still own the land."</TE>

<HD>New Panel on Priestly Abuse Is Planned</HD>
<DH>Church: Board will have more lay members, more power,
direct reporting access to Mahony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles plans to unveil a newly
revamped clergy misconduct review board today with more lay members,
authority to review every allegation of priestly sex abuse in the
region and direct reporting access to Cardinal Roger M. Mahony.</LD>
<LD>   The revamped board, which will be headed by former Los Angeles
County Superior Court Presiding Judge Richard P. Byrne, will replace
a more informal group whose responsibilities were not as clearly
spelled out.</LD>
<LD>   In the past, members essentially advised the vicar of clergy on
whatever cases he chose to bring them, and recommendations were not
always implemented quickly, according to board member Nanette de
Fuentes, a psychologist and sex-abuse survivor who helped found the
original board in 1994.</LD>
<TE>   But she said the old board had also successfully pushed the
archdiocese to make several tough changes, such as more quickly
removing priests under investigation from active duty and informing
parishes that their priests had been removed for sexual misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   The new Clergy Misconduct Oversight Board, among other things,
will conduct an annual review of archdiocesan sexual misconduct
policies, review all complaints and verify that the archdiocese has
reported them to civil authorities. The board will also make
recommendations to Mahony on such issues as outreach to victims,
whether a priest should be removed from ministry and whether a parish
should be notified of the alleged misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   The new board represents one of several changes Mahony has made in
the last several months to strengthen policies against priestly sex
abuse in the region. Today's announcement comes just days after the
nation's Roman Catholic bishops approved a sweeping national policy
to permanently oust from public ministry all priests and deacons
found to have sexually abused minors.</TE>
<TE>   "I truly believe this is a reaffirmation of many years of
professionalism and commitment of the archdiocese ... to effectively
and compassionately deal with the problem of clergy sexual abuse," De
Fuentes said.</TE>
<TE>   She said she was initially "a little skeptical" about whether the
new board would represent any substantive improvement. But two days
of meetings on the board's new duties and Mahony's assurances of a
more central role in archdiocesan policymaking have convinced her
that the panel will become a "cutting edge" model for other cities,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 50 priests in the three-county archdiocese are under
investigation by authorities for alleged abuse of minors. Although
Mahony is regarded as one of the nation's leading proponents of tough
reform, he has also come under fire for his handling of some
misconduct cases.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal had, for instance, transferred Father Michael Stephen
Baker from parish to parish even after the priest confessed his
sexual misconduct of minors to archdiocesan authorities in 1986.
Baker was finally asked to retire in 2000 after a $1.3-million
settlement was made.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how such a case could fall through the review board's
cracks, Byrne replied, "I'm not really sure." But De Fuentes said she
was upset after reading of the Baker case in The Times and met with
Mahony to find out if it had been reported to the board. (Cases come
to the board without the names of priests, parishes or victims, she
said.)</TE>
<TE>   According to De Fuentes, Mahony told her the Baker case first
surfaced before the board was formed and had subsequently been taken
to the board, but not in great detail.</TE>
<TE>   De Fuentes, who could not remember the board's recommendation on
the case, said Mahony's explanations assured her that such handling
of cases "would not happen now."</TE>
<TE>   "I do not feel there was any malicious intent," she said. "I
really feel [the lack of board involvement] had to do with it being
an old case."</TE>
<TE>   The national policy adopted by the nation's bishops in Dallas last
week requires all dioceses to establish lay-dominated review boards
to assist dioceses in evaluating allegations and assessing an accused
perpetrator's fitness for ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Some Catholic reform groups have argued that the only way such
boards can act truly independently of church authorities is for
members to be appointed by lay pastoral councils rather than bishops
and to have binding, not advisory, authority. But no diocese has yet
created such a board--including in Los Angeles, where Mahony has
appointed all members to serve in a strictly advisory capacity.</TE>
<TE>   "The bishops are not letting go of any control, which means the
same people who made the mistakes that created this crisis are still
the ones making the decisions alone. So we haven't really progressed
very much," said Linda Pieczynski, spokeswoman for Call to Action, a
Catholic reform group.</TE>
<TE>   Byrne, who helped develop the new board's duties in consultation
with Mahony and his representatives, disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Cardinal Mahony is the CEO, is the fellow in charge," Byrne said.
"He's the one who's going to have to make the tough decisions and
take ultimate responsibility. He can't give that [authority] to some
lay board such as ours."</TE>
<TE>   In April, Byrne helped direct an archdiocesan attorney on which
court official to call to arrange an extraordinary late-night court
hearing seeking to prevent The Times from publishing e-mails by
Mahony and others. But Byrne said he is unbiased and "can be
completely independent" as board chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the previous board, all members of the new panel will be
publicly identified, as a step toward making archdiocesan policies
more transparent.</TE>
<TE>   The new board will have 13 rather than nine members, nearly all of
them laypeople. They will include one or two priests, a nun, an abuse
victim, parents of abuse victims and mental-health professionals.</TE>
<TE>   One new member, Sister Diane Donoghue of Esperanza Community
Housing Corp., said she hoped the new board would "live by the
Catholic social and economic justice teachings of accountability,
transparency and challenging abusive power." She also said she would
bring the values of her Sisters of Social Service to champion "those
without voices."</TE>

<LD>A judge refused a request by South Gate police unions to temporarily
block the city's implementation of several controversial measures,
including the appointment of a new police chief.</LD>
<LD>   But Judge Dzintra I. Janavs agreed to hold a full hearing on the
matter on July 3.</LD>
<LD>   City officials say the measures will enhance public safety. Among
other things, all officers would be required to wear uniforms. The
council also approved a measure allowing voters to decide whether
Spanish-language proficiency should be a requirement to be police
chief. The unions claim they are retaliatory measures for the unions'
support of a voter recall drive.</LD>

<HD>Jack Buck, 77; Sportscaster Was St. Louis Legend</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack Buck, one of the country's most popular sportscasters and a
beloved institution in St. Louis and throughout much of the Midwest
during a broadcasting career spanning five decades, died Tuesday
night in a St. Louis hospital. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   Afflicted with Parkinson's disease and diabetes, Buck underwent
lung cancer surgery last December. He returned to Barnes-Jewish
Hospital in St. Louis on Jan. 3 to have an intestinal blockage
removed and never left the hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Joe Buck, a broadcaster for FOX and the St. Louis Cardinals'
broadcaster, said his father was in and out of a coma several times
over the last few weeks. On May 16, Buck had another operation to
treat a series of recurring infections, including pneumonia, and was
placed on dialysis.</LD>
<TE>   He died peacefully with his family at his bedside.</TE>
<TE>   The gravelly voiced Buck began calling Cardinal baseball games on
radio in 1954, teaming first with the legendary Harry Caray. Buck
became the lead Cardinal broadcaster in 1970, and spent much of the
last three decades on radio teamed with former Cardinal third-baseman
Mike Shannon.</TE>
<TE>   Buck--who also broadcast Super Bowls and World Series for CBS, ABC
and NBC--may be best known nationally for announcing "Monday Night
Football" for CBS radio with Hank Stram.</TE>
<TE>   Although he broadcast every sport, including basketball, hockey
and bowling, baseball was his favorite. And he always seemed to say a
lot with few words.</TE>
<TE>   When the Cardinals' Mark McGwire tied Roger Maris' record with his
61st home run to set a single-season record in 1998, Buck said,
"Pardon me for a moment while I stand and applaud."</TE>
<TE>   Another famous Buck call came in Game 5 of the 1985 National
League championship series, when Cardinal shortstop Ozzie Smith
homered off L.A. Dodger pitcher Tom Niedenfuer.</TE>
<TE>   "Go crazy, folks. Go crazy!" he told his St. Louis audience.</TE>
<TE>   One of his most famous calls came at the end of Game 1 of the 1988
World Series, when the Dodgers' Kirk Gibson, believed to be too
injured to play, hit a game-winning home run against the Oakland A's
at Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe what I just saw!" he said to much of the country
on CBS radio.</TE>
<TE>   Buck was inducted into the baseball Hall of Fame's broadcasters'
wing in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Of Buck, longtime Dodger announcer Vin Scully said Wednesday, "I
was privileged to know [him] for nearly 50 years and we had a
wonderful relationship. He was a gifted sportscaster of any and all
sports, and I admired his overall ability.</TE>
<TE>   "But I also admired his sense of humor, which was marvelous."</TE>
<TE>   John Francis "Jack" Buck was born Aug. 21, 1924, in Holyoke, Mass.
His father, Earle, was an accountant for the Erie Railroad, based in
Hoboken, N.J., and came home only on weekends. When the railroad
headquarters moved to Cleveland, Earle Buck moved there too while
young Jack remained in Holyoke.</TE>
<TE>   In his autobiography, "That's a Winner," named after his signature
cal after a win by the baseball Cardinals, Buck said his father once
sent him $5 so he could go to a Boston Red Sox game at Fenway Park.
But his mother took $3 of it to pay bills.</TE>
<TE>   "When I look back on my career and my life," Buck wrote, "I think
of my father. He died in 1939 at age 49. I frequently say he never
would have believed what followed. Our family never had an
automobile. When I bought a Plymouth in 1950, I was the first one in
our family to ever own a car."</TE>
<TE>   Buck left home as a teenager to work as a deckhand on the iron ore
boats of the Great Lakes and was drafted into the Army at 19 during
the height of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   He served in Europe and was wounded from shrapnel in Remagen,
Germany. He was awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star.</TE>
<TE>   Buck returned from the war and went to Ohio State. He launched his
broadcasting career at the school's radio station. He was hired by
the Cardinals in 1954. Also up for the job was Chick Hearn, who was
working in Peoria, Ill., at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "Jack won out," Hearn, the Los Angeles Lakers' longtime
broadcaster, said Wednesday. "We'd have a laugh about that over the
years. We'd say the way things worked out we both did OK after that."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, Buck broadcast Cardinals' baseball, AFL games on ABC
and, later, the NFL on CBS.</TE>
<TE>   He was one of the CBS broadcasters of the famous "Ice Bowl Game,"
Green Bay's 21-17 home victory over Dallas in the NFL title game on a
day when the temperature was 13 below zero.</TE>
<TE>   He would call 17 Super Bowls for CBS radio with Stram from 1978 to
1996 as well as "Monday Night Football" through most of that time.</TE>
<TE>   Besides announcing Cardinal games, Buck was also the sports
director at the Cardinals' powerful flagship radio station, KMOX-AM,
heard throughout the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Dierdorf, a Hall of Fame offensive lineman for the football
St. Louis Cardinals, as well as NBC's Bob Costas and many other
broadcasters, were among Buck's disciples.</TE>
<TE>   Dierdorf began working at KMOX as a talk-show host while he was
still playing. At Buck's urging, Dierdorf retired from football in
1983 and became the Cardinals' football commentator the next season.
Buck was the play-by-play announcer.</TE>
<TE>   "Working with Jack was like going to broadcasting school at
Harvard every day," Dierdorf said from his home in St. Louis. "He was
always offering suggestions."</TE>
<TE>   "I owe my broadcasting career to Jack Buck," Dierdorf said.</TE>
<TE>   Dierdorf served as master of ceremonies at Busch Stadium in St.
Louis on Wednesday night as the Cardinals honored their longtime
broadcaster before their game with the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   There will be another public service, with Buck's casket there for
public viewing, before today's game against the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   For the rest of the season, the Cardinals will wear a black
armband with Buck's initials, JFB, on the right sleeve of their
uniforms. Buck's initials will remain cut into the grassy area behind
the wall in center field.</TE>
<TE>   Buck, who had six children with his first wife, Alyce, and two
with wife Carole, is survived by his second wife; sons Jack Jr., Dan
and Joe; and daughters Beverly, Christine, Bonnie, Betsy and Julie.</TE>

<HD>Chain-Reaction Crash of 2 MTA Buses, Tour Bus Injures
Dozens</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An MTA bus crashed into another MTA bus, which slammed into a bus
full of French tourists in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday evening,
sending 27 to hospitals and dozens more home with aches.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said they were amazed that none of the 85 or so
passengers was seriously hurt or killed in the accident at 7:10 p.m.
at Temple and Spring streets.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone was knocked down," said Juan Sanchez, 30, a gardener who
was headed home to South Los Angeles on the No. 28 bus from his job
in Eagle Rock. "Everyone screamed. All the mothers were grabbing for
their children."</LD>
<TE>   Sanchez, who hurt his knee and hand but did not go to a hospital,
said almost everyone on his bus suffered some type of injury. Several
people were treated for possible neck and spine injuries, but none
were critical, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The accident compounded what was already a traffic nightmare
downtown. Police already had closed streets around 1st and Hill
streets to investigate an unattended briefcase. It turned out to be
harmless.</TE>
<TE>   But it meant that Tracy Andrews' bus, the No. 2, which normally
travels up Broadway, made a detour to go west on Temple Street.
Andrews, 40, and other passengers said their bus ran a yellow light.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, "I was looking at another bus coming right at our
back door."</TE>
<TE>   That bus, the No. 28, which had been turning right on Temple from
Spring, crashed into the right flank of her bus, throwing passengers
from their seats. Andrews' bus then plowed into a white luxury bus
carrying about 25 French tourists east on Temple to a Mexican
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Moments after the crash, Andrews said, someone screamed that the
bus was going to blow up and they should all get off.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people in the front were bleeding," she said. Andrews,
who was headed to West Hollywood with a friend, said she had to
scramble over broken glass on floors slick with blood.</TE>
<TE>   Her friend went to a hospital, but Andrews said she thought she
was OK.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the French tourists, meanwhile, seemed unfazed. Some even
whipped out cameras to record the American policemen who descended
upon the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Jullien Daniel, 69, of Grenoble, France, said no one in his party
was injured but many were hungry, and he was pleased when a
replacement tour bus showed up to take them to their restaurant.</TE>

<HD>Olympian to Run for City Council</HD>
<DH>Politics: Paul Gonzalez, a gold medalist in 1984, hopes to
unseat Nick Pacheco. He'll likely face long odds, especially if
Villaraigosa enters race.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Olympic boxer Paul Gonzalez, who became a hometown hero when he won a
gold medal at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, announced Wednesday that
he is challenging City Councilman Nick Pacheco for the 14th District
seat.</LD>
<LD>   "It's time for a change," said Gonzalez, who was the first Mexican
American to win an Olympic gold medal. "I'm running because the 14th
District needs to be represented and I believe I'm the man that can
do the job for them."</LD>
<LD>   Observers of Eastside politics said Gonzalez faces an uphill
battle against the incumbent in the April election, especially if
former state Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa enters the race.</LD>
<TE>   Frank Villalobos, a Boyle Heights activist and president of Barrio
Planners, an architectural firm, said Gonzalez is widely viewed as a
hero on the Eastside.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul Gonzalez not only represents our community as an athlete,
but I think that there's a real recognition that he came from the
projects and here's one of the people that went good out of the
projects," Villalobos said. "But in terms of politics, I don't think
people are necessarily looking at him."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, most political speculation is focused on whether
Villaraigosa will seek the office. The former mayoral candidate who
was defeated by Mayor James K. Hahn last year declined to comment
Wednesday on his intentions, but in recent weeks has told political
supporters that he is considering a run for Pacheco's seat.</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa said Wednesday that he considers Gonzalez a friend
and understands why he's running.</TE>
<TE>   "The 14th Council District is a great district that deserves good
representation," Villaraigosa said. "There's a great deal of concern
about the quality of representation in that district."</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco responded by saying that his work for the district speaks
for itself.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a strong record. We feel that we can beat anybody," he
said. "The real question for Antonio if he runs: Is he committed to
the district or is this just a steppingstone?"</TE>
<TE>   Two others have also announced that they are running for Pacheco's
seat--Alvin Parra, who works for Supervisor Gloria Molina, and
William M. Morrison.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Gonzalez says he is running to serve his community, to
which he remained committed after he gained fame and glory during the
1984 Games.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez, 37, is a motivational speaker and teaches boxing at
Hollenbeck Youth Center, where he trained for the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales filed papers to run for the 14th District seat in 1999,
but failed to gather enough petition signatures to be placed on the
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez said that in that attempt, he filed too late and had not
assembled a large team to back his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   This year, he filed papers in January. The election is in April
2003.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez has received endorsements from high-profile supporters,
including Sheriff Lee Baca and former Los Angeles Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, a number of athletes, including boxer Evander
Holyfield and gold-medal diver Pat McCormick, have endorsed Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Despite what look like long odds, Gonzalez said he is looking
forward to the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's going to be a fight. I'm ready for a fight. I'm a
fighter," he said. "Not only am I a fighter, but I'm a champion. I'm
a winner."</TE>

<HD>Courage in Face of Crime Honored</HD>
<DH>Society: Three who risked their safety to intervene and
help victims are thanked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Duane Miller was lounging in front of his television set one warm
evening last August when he heard the screams.</LD>
<LD>   He darted outside his Hawthorne home and saw a man assaulting a
young woman in a nearby driveway.</LD>
<LD>   " 'Help! He's trying to rape me!' the victim pleaded," said Deputy
Dist. Atty. Alyson Messenger, as she gave a play-by-play of the
incident during a ceremony Wednesday honoring Miller, 36, and two
other Los Angeles-area residents for courageous acts that put
criminals behind bars.</LD>
<TE>   "Duane did not hesitate," Messenger continued. "He yelled that he
was calling the police.... It was enough to distract the man, just
for a moment, which was all our victim needed to slip away from him."</TE>
<TE>   Sixty or so members of the Rotary Club of Westchester, which
sponsored the "D.A.'s Courageous Citizens" ceremony at a hotel near
Los Angeles International Airport, hung on the prosecutor's words
like children at story time.</TE>
<TE>   They laughed and cheered as another prosecutor described how
Olivia Nims, 45, of Inglewood chased down a hit-and-run driver who
had injured an 8-year-old pedestrian.</TE>
<TE>   "Even as the woman swung and fought and scratched our honoree,
Olivia managed to drag her all the way back to the scene of the
crime," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Linda Rosborough.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't the first time Nims had gone out of her way to help a
stranger, Rosborough said.</TE>
<TE>   Six years ago, Nims was shot by gang members who did not want her
to testify about a murder she had witnessed.</TE>
<TE>   Nims eventually testified. The mother of four has long scars
across her chest and belly that remind her of the sacrifice she made.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what made her intervene in these situations, she replied:
"Somebody might have to help me or one of my kids one day."</TE>
<TE>   Salvador Cortez, a custodian in the Pasadena Unified School
District, held his 2-year-old daughter, Lexus, in his arms as a
prosecutor commended him for two acts of bravery.</TE>
<TE>   As Cortez, 37, and his family were driving home from a school
event in October, he saw a man snatch an elderly woman's purse. With
the help of two passersby, Cortez wrestled the thief to the ground
and returned the purse to the victim.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Cortez helped Pasadena police arrest a man he saw
running from the scene of a shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Cortez discreetly followed the gunman on his bicycle long enough
to see his face, and later helped prosecutors convict the shooter,
who was eventually sentenced to 39 years in prison for three
attempted murders.</TE>
<TE>   Although prosecutors held up Miller, Nims and Cortez as heroes,
they also cautioned that citizens should first call police if they
witness a crime.</TE>
<TE>   "These people are very courageous, more courageous than the rest
of us in society, probably, in the face of such great danger," Chief
Deputy Dist. Atty. Curt Livesay said after the luncheon. "But we'd
much rather have live witnesses than seriously injured or dead
heroes."</TE>
<TE>   Miller agreed that he put himself in danger when he confronted the
would-be rapist. "But my first instinct was to help" the victim, he
said.</TE>

<HD>Driver Arrested in Fatal Crash</HD>
<DH>Santa Clarita: Racing is suspected in collision that kills
man and critically injures his wife.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Canyon Country man may have been street racing when he crashed into
an oncoming car, killing the driver and critically injuring a
passenger, authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   David Fresquez, 27, of Canyon Country, was killed and his wife,
Karyn, remained hospitalized Wednesday in critical condition.</LD>
<LD>   Joe Chaidez, 23, was being held in lieu of $250,000 bail on
charges of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence.</LD>
<TE>   Chaidez was arrested shortly after the Tuesday night crash on
Soledad Canyon Road in Santa Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County sheriff's traffic investigators were
interviewing witnesses to determine if the fatal crash was a result
of drag racing or road rage, or if another vehicle was involved.</TE>
<TE>   There was no evidence that drugs or alcohol contributed to the
crash, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "In a collision of this magnitude, those are things we have to
consider," Sheriff's Deputy Tony Arnold said. "It appears, based on
some evidence and witness statements, that [Chaidez] was traveling
above the speed limit."</TE>
<TE>   The posted speed on Soledad Canyon is 50 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Chaidez was driving a 2001 Acura east on Soledad Canyon Road near
Deep Creek Drive about 9 p.m. when he lost control and crossed the
center divider, Arnold said.</TE>
<TE>   The Acura became airborne and slammed upside-down into a 1985
Chevrolet Camaro, which caught fire. A sheriff's deputy extinguished
the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Fresquez was pronounced dead at the scene. He and his wife were
wearing seat belts, according to sheriff's deputies.</TE>
<TE>   Chaidez was treated at the hospital for minor injuries and
released to sheriff's deputies. It was unknown whether he was wearing
a seat belt at the time of the crash.</TE>

<HD>Navy Target of El Toro Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Litigation: The suit challenges the environmental studies
that led to the decision to sell the former base.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Supporters of an airport at the closed El Toro Marine base sued the
Navy on Wednesday, asking a federal judge in Washington to block
plans to sell the property for parkland and park-compatible
development.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed by three pro-airport groups, challenges the
Navy's environmental studies, which formed the basis for its decision
in April to sell the property under zoning approved by Orange County
voters in March. The Navy analyzed a commercial airport and two plans
for a commercial development at El Toro--neither of which could be
built with the new zoning, the suit said.</LD>
<LD>   "The purpose of [the National Environmental Policy Act] is for
public agencies to disclose the environmental impacts of a proposed
project," said attorney Barbara Lichman with the Airport Working
Group of Orange County, which filed the suit. "Since no one knows
what will be developed at El Toro, the existing [review] cannot serve
that purpose."</LD>
<TE>   A separate suit filed earlier by airport backers in state court
challenges the constitutionality of Measure W, which replaced airport
zoning at the base with parkland and limited development.</TE>
<TE>   That suit was transferred to Los Angeles County and a hearing is
scheduled next month before Judge Philip Hickox.</TE>
<TE>   Airport opponents said the latest lawsuit is a delaying tactic
that won't resurrect airport plans or stop the Navy from selling the
property.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it exceedingly ironic that these petitioners are trying to
take money out of the federal government's hands at a time when the
military could use it," said attorney Richard Jacobs, who represents
the anti-airport El Toro Reuse Planning Authority. "We're down to the
hard-core airport supporters flailing around at the last minute."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County supervisors, who favored the airport on votes of 3
to 2, changed course after Measure W. On a separate 3-to-2 vote, the
board approved annexing the 4,700-acre base to the city of Irvine.
Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad provided the swing vote and has threatened
to rescind it if Irvine doesn't comply with its promise to provide
money from the development of El Toro for parks in north Orange
County. Coad has said she wants funding guarantees by Tuesday or she
will vote against annexation.</TE>
<TE>   Lichman accused the Navy and Irvine of trying to sneak a
development project into the heart of Orange County without an
environmental review. Besides analyzing what is built at the former
base, the Navy also must consider the cumulative effects of other
developments nearby, she said, including a plan to build 12,500 homes
in areas north and west of the base.</TE>
<TE>   Other groups joining the lawsuit were Citizens for Jobs and the
Economy, a political committee; and the Orange County Regional
Airport Authority, a coalition of cities backing the airport.</TE>

<HD>Archdiocese Gives Files on Priests to Grand Jury</HD>
<DH>Probe: The attorney for the child-molestation suspects
seeks a hearing to bar the material from prosecutors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has handed over the
personnel files of three priests under criminal investigation for
alleged sexual abuse of minors. But prosecutors won't see what is in
those files any time soon.</LD>
<LD>   An attorney for the three priests filed a motion seeking a court
hearing on whether the archdiocese's releasing of the files violated
the priests' privacy. Until that hearing next month, the files will
remain in the office of the county grand jury, which had subpoenaed
them at the request of the district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley turned to the grand
jury for subpoenas last Thursday to obtain the personnel files after
the priests' lawyer, Donald Steier, protested the disclosure.</LD>
<TE>   Archdiocese officials insisted that they always have favored the
handing over of the files to prosecutors. "It is now an issue between
the district attorney's office and Don Steier," said Michael
Hennigan, attorney for the archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office declined to comment Wednesday on
the battle for the records, citing rules governing grand jury
secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley has gradually pressured Cardinal Roger M. Mahony to turn
over information and records related to priests accused of abusive
behavior toward minors. Cooley at one point accused the cardinal of
delaying investigations by failing to turn over to police
investigators vital information on abuse.</TE>
<TE>   That pressure culminated last Thursday when Bill Hodgman, head
deputy in charge of the sex crimes unit, successfully sought the
subpoenas from the grand jury for documents related to Father Michael
Stephen Baker and Father Michael Wempe, both retired, and Father
David Granadino.</TE>
<TE>   Steier's motion to quash the disclosure of the documents is set
for early July before Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Dan T. Oki,
sources said. Because that hearing involves grand jury subpoenas, it
will be behind closed doors, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Court officials declined to provide any details about the
proceedings because of grand jury secrecy rules.</TE>
<TE>   Steier contends that state and federal privacy laws protect his
clients from the revealing of the files' contents, which include
psychological evaluations.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony transferred Baker to several parishes after the priest told
him in 1986 that he had molested young boys.</TE>
<TE>   He later approved a secret $1.3-million settlement with two men
who had allegedly been abused by Baker in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal has said that he erred when he transferred Wempe, who
is accused of molesting children, to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
about 14 years ago without telling hospital officials.</TE>
<TE>   Wempe was among eight priests whom Mahony forced to retire earlier
this year after the archdiocese adopted a "zero tolerance" policy for
abusers following a lawsuit settlement</TE>
<TE>   All three priests named in the subpoenas are under investigation
by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. Prosecutors are expected to
seek subpoenas for personnel records of some of the 34 priests under
investigation by Los Angeles police, sources said.</TE>

<LD>After a decade of planning, Laguna Beach abruptly killed an
$8.6-million project aimed at relieving a bottleneck in an
underground flood channel that sends a river of sand and silt racing
through downtown during heavy rains.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council's decision Tuesday night to abandon the ambitious
public works project came after officials said they could not resolve
how much contaminated soil existed around the channel, how much it
would cost to remove it and who would pay for the cleanup.</LD>
<LD>   The project was strongly opposed by environmentalists, who were
troubled by public health risks, and by merchants, who feared the
construction effort would increase traffic and chase away customers
during the 1 1/2 to two years of work.</LD>
<TE>   The decision leaves the community of 25,000 exposed to major
floods that have wreaked havoc on the downtown area. By rejecting the
project, the city also forfeits the bulk of the funding and staff
that the Orange County Flood Control District and Army Corps of
Engineers had agreed to supply.</TE>
<TE>   "I had more questions last night about the project than I did a
year ago, so I had the wind taken out of my sail," said Councilman
Paul Freeman, who had been one of its most ardent supporters. "I
still support doing something. It's just that enough concerns, enough
uncertainties, were raised that I couldn't vote to keep this
particular project going."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Cheryl Kinsman, the only dissenter, said even though
the project wasn't perfect, it would have gone a long way toward
preventing storm water from streaming along narrow streets, swamping
the business district and beaches, and threatening lives.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want that to happen," Kinsman said, noting how the city
will have to pay for an alternative project. "This is a huge missed
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   By virtue of its topography, Laguna Beach is a catch basin for
urban runoff and flood waters from inland cities.</TE>
<TE>   The existing flood channel backs up at drains near Beach Street,
where S-curves pinch capacity from 1 million gallons a minute to
360,000 gallons a minute. In 1997, El Nino rains closed businesses
and damaged the boardwalk and beach. They also destroyed nearby Aliso
Pier.</TE>
<TE>   To relieve the pressure points, the county flood district and Army
Corps of Engineers planned to build a concrete box, 14 feet wide and
10 feet tall, under Broadway. It would run about 450 yards through
the intersection with Pacific Coast Highway and out through the
middle of Main Beach.</TE>
<TE>   In a unanimous vote in November, the City Council granted final
approval for the plan, even though it learned at the last minute that
MTBE and other chemicals had pooled in the soil and groundwater
beneath the construction site.</TE>
<TE>   The Surfrider Foundation, Clean Water Now Coalition and the South
Orange County Watershed Conservancy have mounted a fierce campaign
against the project, writing letters to city leaders and conducting
their own research and analysis.</TE>
<TE>   During Tuesday's hearing, group representatives said the city
needs to better assess the public health risks. They also said the
new channel would actually create a path for contaminants to pollute
their beaches and that the wider outfall drain planned for Main Beach
would actually worsen the erosion there.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the community as a whole was concerned about what would
be the horrendous impacts of the construction," said Rick Wilson,
chairman of the local Surfrider chapter. "We are pleased. I think we
definitely made a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Council members who voted against the project concurred. They
noted that some of the merchants who complained so loudly about flood
damage now complained more about their businesses being hurt by
construction.</TE>
<TE>   "I think as we got better acquainted with the project, it appeared
to many of us on the council that it was tragically flawed," Mayor
Wayne Baglin said Wednesday. "You look around the room and you
wonder, does anybody want this?"</TE>
<TE>   The council plans to begin discussing options in six months.</TE>
<TE>   County flood district officials said they were disappointed but
respect the community's wishes.</TE>
<TE>   The Corps of Engineers said the funding might still be available
if Laguna revisits the project soon. Otherwise it would be available
to other cities.</TE>

<HD>Slain Girl's Prints in RV, Expert Says</HD>
<DH>Trial: Vehicle belongs to David Westerfield, accused of
killing Danielle van Dam.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A Police Department fingerprint expert testified Wednesday that he
was "absolutely certain" that two fingerprints near the bed in David
Westerfield's recreational vehicle were those of Danielle van Dam,
the 7-year-old girl abducted from her home and murdered.</LD>
<LD>   In sometimes gruesome detail, the expert, Jeffrey Graham Jr.,
explained how the fingerprints had been matched with prints taken
from the mummified hands of the nude, decomposing corpse found Feb.
27, three weeks after Danielle disappeared from her bedroom in the
upscale Sabre Springs area.</LD>
<LD>   After several days of testimony about the sexually permissive
lifestyle that Danielle's parents purportedly led, the trial is
focusing on detailed descriptions of forensic evidence gathered at
the Van Dam and Westerfield homes and from the body, which was found
in a rural area of San Diego County.</LD>
<TE>   The grim nature of the testimony led Danielle's mother, Brenda, to
flee the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   A police evidence technician testified that strands of black hair
had been found under one of Danielle's armpits and clutched in one
fist. Westerfield has black hair.</TE>
<TE>   Questions about whose hair it might have been were deferred until
prosecutors call DNA experts. When the case shifts to DNA, the
prosecution will be handled by Deputy Dist. Atty. George "Woody"
Clarke, a DNA expert who assisted Los Angeles prosecutors in the O.J.
Simpson murder case.</TE>
<TE>   Because the child's body was left nude and uncovered, it
decomposed quickly and was attacked by animals, technicians
testified. That made getting fingerprints from the hands very
difficult, Graham said.</TE>
<TE>   "They were extremely mummified, dried up, wrinkled up, shriveled,"
Graham said. "It really makes it a lot harder."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Steven Feldman has not disputed that the
fingerprints in the recreational vehicle might have been Danielle's.
But he has asserted that they were left there when Danielle, her
mother and one of her brothers went to the Westerfield home to sell
Girl Scout cookies.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda van Dam has testified that her daughter went nowhere near
the recreational vehicle during the visit to the home.</TE>
<TE>   Graham testified that he could not tell when the fingerprints had
been left in the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield, 50, a self-employed design engineer, could face the
death penalty if convicted of kidnapping and murder.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors assert that he harbored sexual fantasies about small
girls and may have spied on the Van Dam backyard with binoculars.</TE>

<HD>Crews Gaining on Gorman Blaze</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cooler temperatures, higher humidity and calmer air gave firefighters
the upper hand Wednesday against a 1,500-acre wildfire in the Angeles
National Forest near Gorman, about 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   That was good news for Southern California businesses and
residents, who were asked by state power managers late Tuesday to cut
back their electricity use because two of California's major
transmission lines near the fire had automatically shut down.</LD>
<LD>   Power available to consumers returned to normal and the towers
were back online by Wednesday afternoon, said Lorie O'Donley,
spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator. "We seem
to be doing fine now and we're not as concerned," she said. The
agency manages electricity flow for the state.</LD>
<TE>   Elsewhere in California, seven other wildfires had burned at least
36,120 acres by late Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Bluecut fire, 50 miles east of Los Angeles in the San
Bernardino National Forest, was 40% contained after charring 7,000
acres. In eastern San Diego County, the Mt. Laguna fire burned 750
acres and destroyed at least three structures. The 400-acre Banning
fire, which includes a portion of the Morongo Indian Reservation, was
expected to be fully contained by this morning.</TE>
<TE>   Other fires were being fought near Yosemite National Park, on
Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara County, near Lake Isabella
in Kern County and at Patterson Pass in eastern Alameda County.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Gorman fire was only 60% contained Wednesday, fire
officials were optimistic because the blaze had not grown during the
day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very quiet. If it stays like this overnight, we'll have a
real good handle on it," U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Gail Wright
said. Full containment is expected by 6 p.m. Saturday. No residences
were threatened and the cause of the fire was under investigation,
Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an incredibly early and dry season, and the least thing will
start a fire," she said. Brush conditions are so dry in California
that the forest service is asking motorists to stay on paved roads so
hot undercarriages will not ignite leaves or weeds.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was reported about 2:30 p.m. Tuesday. Fanned by 25 mph
winds and aided by heat in the low 90s, flames quickly chewed through
desert scrub and chaparral in steep terrain east of Interstate 5 and
south of California 138. By Wednesday, temperatures had cooled to the
high 80s, the humidity had risen and gusty winds stayed in the 10- to
20-mph range, all helping about 450 fire personnel quell the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   As flames neared two major north-south transmission lines, sensors
shut down the 500-kilovolt wires. State energy officials immediately
asked some large electricity customers to reduce consumption, and
urged all other consumers to cut back to prevent power failures.</TE>

<HD>Wild Horses a Challenge for Adoptive Owners</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are a few things required to adopt a wild horse: money, a
proper corral and enough patience to deal with an animal that may
kick you for petting it.</LD>
<LD>   For those ready to take up the challenge, the U.S. Bureau of Land
Management is offering more than 100 wild horses and burros for
adoption this weekend in Woodland Hills.</LD>
<LD>   "The adoption program is basically our only means of finding these
animals a home in the private sector," said Doran Sanchez, a
spokesman for the bureau. Animals are offered for adoption several
times a month at various locations in the western United States.</LD>
<TE>   About 80 mustangs and 30 burros from Northern California and the
high deserts of Nevada will be brought to Pierce College for the
three-day viewing and adoption, said Mindy Odom, California's
adoption coordinator for the bureau.</TE>
<TE>   But beware of the responsibilities that come with adopting a wild
horse, said Becky Borquez, California's coordinator of the American
Mustang &amp; Burro Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not for everyone," Borquez said. Adopters "really need to
make a commitment to the time and energy and money," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Borquez spent $1,000 in veterinary bills within months of adopting
a bay horse from the bureau in 1986. Still, she said, there's nothing
better than riding her horse on the trails near her Shadow Hills
home.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez said the bureau has been putting wild horses up for
adoption since 1973 to ease overpopulation in areas where wild
animals roam. And for the most part, he said, the Adopt-A-Horse
program has been successful, with 185,000 animals adopted.</TE>
<TE>   Minimum bids are $125 for a mustang, $125 for a jenny, or female
burro, and $25 for a jack, or male burro. Horses usually go for less
than $200, but bids have reached $1,000, Odom said.</TE>
<TE>   "The only time it gets into hot and heavy bidding is when two
people just have to have the same animal," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Adopters must be at least 18 and sign a contract that they have
adequate facilities and financial means to care for the animal.</TE>
<TE>   For one year after the adoption, the bureau will retain the title
to the horse and make visits to be sure the animal is properly cared
for. After one year, adopters may apply for the title or sell the
horse.</TE>
<TE>   The horses and burros may be previewed from noon to 5 p.m. Friday
and 7 to 9 a.m. Saturday at Pierce College, 6201 Winnetka Ave. The
auction will be held from 9 to 10 a.m. Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   After that, the remaining animals will be sold on a first-come,
first-served basis from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and 7 a.m. to 5
p.m. Sunday.</TE>

<HD>It's the Perfect Day to Celebrate Freedom</HD>
<DH>Rites: Thousands gather in L.A. to mark the day news of
emancipation came to slaves in Texas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some brought their children and grandchildren so they too would
remember Juneteenth, the day the Emancipation Proclamation came to
slaves in Galveston, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Mattie Ward said the annual picnic at Leimert Park on Wednesday
was subdued compared to events in her hometown of Shreveport, La.</LD>
<LD>   "We used to call it a boogie-woogie," said the 70-year-old
grandmother, smiling broadly at her 4-year-old grandson, Alexander
Pratt.</LD>
<TE>   This was Ward's first Juneteenth celebration in Los Angeles--just
one of a handful held throughout Southern California this week--and
she was joined by about 2,000 other people who streamed into the
park.</TE>
<TE>   In Shreveport, Ward said, most African Americans stayed home from
work and school on June 19. They celebrated with picnics and dances.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted the kids to see this," said Ward of her grandson and his
friend Sierra Callaway, also 4, who squirmed in a folding chair, her
blond hair bright in the sun.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to remember because our parents remembered," Ward
said.</TE>
<TE>   On June 19, 1865--2 1/2 years after the signing of the
Emancipation Proclamation--the Union Army arrived in Galveston and
informed the slaves there that they were free.</TE>
<TE>   The newly freed celebrated over "red soda water" and watermelon,
about all they had, the organizers said. And since then, June 19 has
been commemorated among African Americans, mostly in the southwest,
as Emancipation Day.</TE>
<TE>   In June 1999, the California Legislature passed Assembly
Concurrent Resolution No. 64, recognizing June 19 as Juneteenth or
Emancipation Day.</TE>
<TE>   A ceremony at the Watts Towers and Arts Center on Wednesday
afternoon to honor African American sculptor and architect John
Outterbridge was punctuated with a reception at which watermelon and
strawberry soda were served.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Leonard of View Park, a Texas native in cowboy boots and
red, white and blue shirt, presided over the Leimert Park
get-together. The 71-year-old grandfather--who has an 8-year-old
daughter--began hosting Juneteenth picnics in his backyard in 1949.
Today, it costs about $5,000 to put on the event, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like a homecoming for a whole lot of people," Leonard
said. "There are a lot of Texans here who recognize Juneteenth like
you would the Fourth of July."</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for us to celebrate and get together," said Virena
Woods of Inglewood, sitting in the shade with her family.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a yellow head wrap and matching dress, the 67-year-old
grandmother said the gathering is much more important than July 4,
because for African Americans, it marks the end of hundreds of years
of bondage.</TE>
<TE>   It's also heartwarming, said the native Texan, to see people of
color gathering on a warm, late spring day to remember their
heritage, and to teach the next generation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's beautiful to see all these brown faces together," she said,
shouting over the blues that wafted from a boombox propped up in a
nearby store windowsill. "Every year I come out. I make it my
business to come out."</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles police detectives want to question a passenger in a sport
utility vehicle that was involved in a fatal head-on collision with a
van carrying developmentally disabled adults.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Joseph Merino, 44, was in the front passenger seat of the
SUV being driven by Bonnie Yvonne Lee, 28, of Van Nuys, Los Angeles
Police Det. Jose Viramontes said at a news conference Wednesday at
the Van Nuys police station.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives appealed to Merino, who disappeared after the accident,
to contact them in connection with the case.</LD>
<TE>   Police believe Merino resides in the San Francisco area, but he
also has lived in San Diego, San Carlos and Honolulu, Viramontes
said. He also urged others who may have witnessed the crash to come
forward.</TE>
<TE>   Lee has been charged with two counts of vehicular manslaughter,
and one count each of driving without a license and child
endangerment. The latter charge was for allegedly driving recklessly
with a 2-year-old child in the back seat.</TE>
<TE>   Lee was driving about 70 mph in the 6800 block of Woodley Avenue
on May 23 when her Ford Explorer swerved into oncoming traffic and
hit the van owned by the Tierra del Sol Foundation, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Tauheedah Brown, 25, a foundation employee, and Robert Hawthorne,
38, a client, died from injuries suffered in the crash. Four other
van passengers were treated at hospitals and released.</TE>

<HD>James Luisi, 73; Emmy-Winning Character Actor</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Luisi, a character actor adept at portraying hard-boiled
detectives and gangsters and remembered for his long-running role as
Lt. Doug Chapman on television's "The Rockford Files," has died.</LD>
<LD>   Luisi, 73, died June 7 in Los Angeles of cancer.</LD>
<LD>   A professional basketball player with the Baltimore Bullets for
two years, Luisi got into acting in the late 1950s after hearing that
a neighborhood friend, Anthony Franciosa, was appearing in a Broadway
show. "I can do that," Luisi said, and promptly enrolled at the
American Academy of Dramatic Arts.</LD>
<TE>   Although probably best known for "The Rockford Files" with James
Garner, Luisi won his top acting award, an Emmy, in 1976 for his
portrayal of George Washington in the NBC special, "First Ladies'
Diaries: Martha Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Luisi also appeared in episodes of many of television's most
popular detective and adventure series, including "Cannon," "Kojak,"
"Hunter," "Wonder Woman," "T.J. Hooker," "Hart to Hart," "The
A-Team," "Knight Rider," "The Fall Guy," "Magnum, P.I." and "L.A.
Law."</TE>
<TE>   For a single season in 1983, he starred in his own series,
"Renegades," as a hip cop who organizes seven tough young gang
leaders, including Patrick Swayze, to help him fight crime.</TE>
<TE>   In his early acting years, Luisi appeared regularly in the soap
operas "Another World" and "Days of Our Lives" and in such Western
series as "Gunsmoke."</TE>
<TE>   The actor began his career on the stage, appearing in Broadway's
"Alfie!," "The Soldiers" and musicals "Sweet Charity," "Do I Hear a
Waltz?" and "Zorba." Off-Broadway, he had leading roles in "The
Crucible," "Detective Story" and "Threepenny Opera."</TE>
<TE>   He continued working in legitimate theater, notably in national
tours and Southern California. Luisi earned the Valley Theater League
Award in 1994 for best director of a new play when he handled "Final
Reunion" for the Valley Theater. Born in East Harlem, N.Y., Luisi
attended St. Francis College on a basketball scholarship. He served
in the Army during the Korean War.</TE>
<TE>   Luisi is survived by his wife of 41 years, the former Georgia
Phillips, and their daughter, Jamie Swartz of Los Angeles; a brother,
Jerry Luisi, of Dallas, and two grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A public memorial is being planned. The family has asked that
memorial donations be sent to the American Cancer Society.</TE>

<HD>Fred Marer, 93; Ceramics Collector, Math Professor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fred Marer, a mathematics professor of modest means who built an
extraordinary collection of contemporary ceramics and donated it to
Scripps College in Claremont, died of pneumonia June 6 at Kaiser
Permanente Hospital in West Los Angeles. He was 93.</LD>
<LD>   Marer made his living as a professor of mathematics for 30 years
at Los Angeles City College, but he fed his soul with avant-garde
ceramics and intense intellectual relationships with the creators of
the works he purchased. His legacy is a holding of more than 1,500
pieces that represent the evolution of a lively art form during the
last half century.</LD>
<LD>   The collection--presented to Scripps in segments over about 25
years--is particularly strong in works from the 1950s and '60s by
major California artists, including Peter Voulkos, John Mason, Ken
Price, Jerry Rothman, Paul Soldner, Michael Frimkess and Henry
Takemoto. Ceramic pioneers Laura Andreson, Shoji Hamada, Otto and
Vivika Heino, Marguerite Wildenhain and Beatrice Wood are also
represented, along with many younger artists.</LD>
<TE>   Soldner, who taught ceramics at Scripps for many years and
organized the college's annual ceramics exhibition, is credited with
persuading Marer to donate his collection to the college. But Marer
offered little resistance.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it should go to a friendly place where it wouldn't get
lost," he told The Times in 1993, when he announced a landmark gift
of the most valuable core of his collection.</TE>
<TE>   "Fred Marer was an extraordinarily generous man who had the vision
to recognize the importance of West Coast ceramics and the new
sculptural direction of art in clay," said Mary MacNaughton, director
of the Ruth Chandler Williamson Gallery at Scripps. "He was eager for
young artists to learn from his collection, and we are happy to make
that possible. Every year, hundreds of ceramic students from all over
Southern California visit the Marer Collection at Scripps."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his large gift of ceramics, Marer donated 200
Japanese prints to Scripps and 146 artworks--mostly European
prints--to Pomona College.</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1908 in New York City, Marer was a high achiever who began
his college education on a scholarship at Fordham University. He
moved to Los Angeles for graduate study at USC, where he earned a
master's degree in mathematics. Hoping to pursue a doctorate, he
found employment as a social worker and briefly worked as a
substitute teacher in the Los Angeles public schools.</TE>
<TE>   He entered a PhD program at UCLA, but couldn't afford to continue.
Instead, he took a job teaching math at Los Angeles City College,
where he served as head of the department.</TE>
<TE>   His abiding love affair with ceramic art began in 1954 with a
visit to a faculty exhibition at the Los Angeles County Art Institute
(now the Otis College of Art and Design). Voulkos, who became the
nation's leading ceramic sculptor, had recently arrived at the
institute and had just begun to attract a cadre of adventurous
students who would transform ceramics from conservative decoration to
an avant-garde art form.</TE>
<TE>   Marer spotted a tiny pot by Voulkos and sent him a note asking if
he could buy it. Voulkos scrawled his reply on the back of the note:
"Sure. Come over any time." When Marer returned, the pot had been
stolen, but he bought two other pieces--and kept going back to the
ceramics studio. Before long, he had a burgeoning collection and the
beginning of lifelong friendships with artists.</TE>
<TE>   Marer often said that his primary contribution to the renowned
ceramics revolution at Otis was coffee. "I would buy 3-pound tins,
always at sales, which the artists would brew in an empty can, hobo
style," he said in a remembrance published by Scripps. But he is
remembered as a catalyst for productive discussions and a passionate
advocate who played a valuable role in the development of ceramics.</TE>
<TE>   "Fred Marer was the switchboard of the ceramic art world," said
historian and dealer Garth Clark, who got his professional start in
Los Angeles and maintains an influential ceramics gallery in New
York. "He was a very generous man who was the point of introduction
in the field. When you came to Los Angeles, you would contact him,
and he would put you in touch with all the artists and curators."</TE>
<TE>   Marer hosted regular dinners for artists and quietly provided
assistance in the form of temporary housing or employment, Clark
said. "He was tremendously friendly and wonderfully warm, but he was
also tough and demanding intellectually. He didn't like small talk;
if you made a loose remark, he would make you defend it. There was a
real rigor to him."</TE>
<TE>   Marer characterized his involvement with ceramics in more casual
terms.</TE>
<TE>   "I bought what I liked, practically always from people I liked,"
he told The Times. Reflecting on his acquisitive passion, he jokingly
put it in financial terms. "When I was a kid, I couldn't even buy a
nickel piece of candy. When I was teaching at LACC, I had to do
something with all that money."</TE>
<TE>   He began buying contemporary ceramics when works of rising stars
could be had for less than $100 apiece, and he quickly developed an
eye for quality.</TE>
<TE>   "But Fred had one rule," Soldner said. "The work had to be
affordable. As a result, some artists who should be in the collection
priced themselves out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Artists represented in his collection were expected to indulge
Marer's intellectual curiosity, Soldner said. "When Fred came to
visit, he would ask a lot of questions. It wasn't all admiration. He
wanted to know philosophical reasons for what we were doing."</TE>
<TE>   Marer said he never bargained with an artist but confessed to
buying a few things that he didn't care for, to avoid hurt feelings.
"Just imagine what would have happened if I were rich," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Marer's associates say he was motivated by a pure love of art. He
rarely sold a piece from his collection--even when it filled his
modest apartment and garage to overflowing. The art became "an
obstacle course," Marer admitted, but he was delighted to see its
proliferation and acceptance. "No longer is ceramic art dominated by
so few," he said toward the end of his life. "It is alive and well
throughout the land."</TE>
<TE>   Marer's first wife, Mary Corren Marer, died in 1976. He is
survived by his second wife, Estelle Maziotta Marer; step-daughter
Esther Lee Alpern of Los Angeles; granddaughter Mary Clark of Los
Angeles; and grandson Eric Clark of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Marer's interment and memorial service will be held at 3 p.m.
Sunday at Mount Sinai Memorial Park, 5950 Forest Lawn Drive.</TE>

<HD>Bill Targets Handling of Mold Claims</HD>
<DH>Politics: Insurers would have to pay for damage caused by a
covered loss, notify clients of hazards. Industry, facing rise in
payouts, says measure may lead to higher rates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON ORTIZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California insurance companies are predicting everything from
sky-high homeowner insurance rates to a slowdown in the housing
market if legislation aimed at protecting policyholders against mold
damage becomes law.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Bill 1763 would mandate that insurers pay for mold damage
caused by a covered loss such as a burst water pipe unless their
policies specifically excluded it.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, by state Sen. Deborah Ortiz (D-Sacramento), would
also require insurers to tell property owners when an incident for
which a claim is filed is likely to spawn mold.</LD>
<TE>   The state Senate passed the bill 21 to 11 last month, sending it
to the Assembly, where it awaits debate in the Insurance Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz said that she wrote the measure after learning that
insurance companies were seeking to limit or exclude mold coverage
from their policies.</TE>
<TE>   State Insurance Commissioner Harry Low told the Senate Insurance
Committee in April that he had received more than 200 such requests
from insurers in 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   All of those requests were granted, said Low's spokeswoman Nanci
Kramer, because the commissioner does not have the authority to
control what insurance companies cover, only how much they charge.</TE>
<TE>   Since the mold exclusions kicked in, the insurers have dropped
homeowners' rates 1% to 7%, depending on the policy and the carrier,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz accused insurers of acting rashly in limiting their
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "They triggered this legislation by rushing to the commissioner,"
Ortiz said.</TE>
<TE>   No federal or state laws or regulations define unsafe levels of
mold exposure or how to remove mold. Another Ortiz bill, last year's
SB 732, ordered the state Department of Health Services to study mold
and set health standards by July 1, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Although Gov. Gray Davis signed the bill into law, he did not
include money in his 2002-03 budget proposal to pay for it, and
funding remains uncertain as legislators craft a budget compromise.</TE>
<TE>   The insurance lobby started making overtures to the Assembly last
week for a compromise: The insurers would pay for a state mold study
if Ortiz would rewrite or pull back SB 1763.</TE>
<TE>   "We're willing to pay our fair share," said Dan Dunmoyer of the
Personal Insurance Federation of California, an insurance industry
trade group. "We want to figure out the science of mold. People have
been living with it for a couple of millennia, so we can wait for a
few months before we jump off the cliff."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz said that such offers won't persuade her to reconsider the
current legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Until a few years ago, insurance carriers didn't think much about
mold and treated it like smoke damage after a fire. If water from a
burst pipe produced mold, insurers repaired the plumbing and cleaned
up the secondary damage. A soaked carpet would be dried out or
replaced without much dispute. Sheetrock on a waterlogged wall would
be stripped and repaired.</TE>
<TE>   But that was before a series of high-profile cases got national
attention and threw a scare into the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a Texas woman won a $32-million judgment from Farmers
Insurance Group to pay for mold damage to her 22-room mansion. Last
summer a federal jury in California awarded $17.5 million in punitive
damages to a homeowner whose insurer had declined coverage for mold
damage. The trial judge reduced the award to $3 million, and the case
is on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainer Ed McMahon filed a $20-million lawsuit in April
against American Equity Insurance Co. alleging that improperly
treated toxic mold in his Beverly Hills house sickened him and his
wife and killed their dog.</TE>
<TE>   Industry lobbyists are calling mold cases "the new asbestos," not
because of any proven comparable health risks, but because they fuel
public hysteria and feed a burgeoning industry of lawyers and
environmental-cleanup specialists eager to capitalize on fear.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer Attorneys of California and other advocacy groups say
insurers are the ones panicking. They see SB 1763 as a "common sense"
bill that does little more than maintain the status quo.</TE>
<TE>   "Insurance companies already have a duty to investigate claims and
keep policyholders informed of the status of their claims," said Amy
Bach of the nonprofit United Policyholders. "SB 1763 is a rational
response to an overreaction by insurers to the cost of cleaning up
mold damage."</TE>
<TE>   Both opponents and supporters of the bill agree on two things:
Mold is everywhere, and some people are sensitive to it.</TE>
<TE>   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that mold is
common outdoors and indoors. It can grow on moist building materials,
including wood, tile, paint, wallpaper, drywall and carpet. Like hay
fever-producing plant pollen, mold has been linked to some
respiratory illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have not conclusively proved whether toxic molds such
as the infamous Stachybotrys chartarum cause memory loss or internal
bleeding, two symptoms highlighted in national media stories on the
subject.</TE>
<TE>   The Insurance Information Network of California released survey
results this month showing that water-damage payments are on the
rise.</TE>
<TE>   California insurers paid an average of $4,730 per water-damage
claim in 2001, up more than $1,000 per claim from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   "That's because of mold," said Peter Moraga of the nonprofit
Insurance Information Network of California. "You can see how the
costs of mold remediation skyrocketed."</TE>
<TE>   In Texas, which has the highest homeowner premiums in the country,
State Farm stopped underwriting property insurance in September after
reporting a $500-million loss for the first eight months of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The company said much of that loss came from the growing mold-loss
claims in the state, though a State Farm spokesman acknowledged that
the exact cost is difficult to calculate because fungus cleanup has
traditionally been broadly listed as a water-damage repair.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't even start tracking mold-loss claims separately until
recently, because it was never a big issue," said Keith Androff, a
Texas spokesman for State Farm.</TE>
<TE>   The company has yet to resume writing new Texas policies, but
since March existing customers have been able to pay 50% higher
premiums to include mold coverage on their homeowner policies.</TE>
<TE>   In California, State Farm withdrew from writing new homeowner
policies May 1, citing uncertainty in the financial stability of the
state's property insurance market.</TE>
<TE>   Now, insurers predict that if SB 1763 becomes law, other companies
will follow suit or may raise premiums to offset expensive mold
remediation costs and to fight lawsuits over what they say is vague
language in the bill requiring companies to notify policyholders of
possible mold hazards.</TE>
<TE>   And, they warn, the damage could spill over into the state's home
construction and real estate industries if insurance becomes harder
to find and afford in a market with fewer companies competing for
business.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not delivering a threat here," said Jerry Davies, spokesman
for the Personal Insurance Federation of California. "But more
insurers could decide to pull out of the state. Look at what happened
to Texas. Do we want that to happen in California too? And you know,
you can't have a mortgage without homeowner's insurance."</TE>
<TE>   The objections don't surprise Ortiz. She expects the insurance
lobby to ratchet up pressure on the Assembly as it debates her bill
in coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "They will say they're losing money. They're going to make the
case that it harms their industry," Ortiz said. "I'm not convinced.
Many fear the potential cost, but our insurance law was never
designed to ensure these companies make a fat profit. We expect our
homeowner's policies to cover losses like this, and they need to do
that instead of running away from it."</TE>
<TE>   The Assembly Insurance Committee is scheduled to discuss SB 1763
on June 26.</TE>

<HD>Soccer Mom Told Star That Fun Comes First</HD>
<DH>World Cup: U.S. prodigy Landon Donovan still does plenty of
winning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORA ZAMICHOW</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Donna Kenney-Cash does not consider herself the Ultimate Soccer Mom.</LD>
<LD>   OK, so her son is Landon Donovan, the 20-year-old touted as
America's first soccer prodigy and the player who scored a decisive
goal in the World Cup, catapulting the U.S. team to the quarterfinals
on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, she has watched practically every game her son has played
since he walked onto the field at age 5. (He scored five goals that
first day.) Sure, she drove a minivan, gave out orange slices and
juice boxes at hundreds of Saturday games.</LD>
<TE>   She has even chided a few referees, yelling, "Oh, c'mon!" And when
Landon scored, she would punch the air and scream, "Good job!"</TE>
<TE>   But here's proof she is America's Uber-Soccer Mom: She doesn't
think Lanny should play unless he has fun. And she would have
preferred he attend college rather than turn pro at 16.</TE>
<TE>   Kenney-Cash, 48, a teacher for learning-disabled children at a
Fontana elementary school, felt she didn't fit in with other soccer
moms. She encouraged her son to play the violin and focus on school.</TE>
<TE>   When Landon was 2, his parents got divorced. While some teammates
sported pricey shoes, her boy wore $11 Payless sneakers. (Landon
hates her mentioning this because he thinks it sounds like whining.)</TE>
<TE>   It's not easy being the mother of a soccer virtuoso. She can't get
used to people asking her son--the boy who loves guacamole and crab
legs--for his autograph. Recently, Donovan's team, the San Jose
Earthquakes, had a Donovan night and gave out replicas of his jersey.</TE>
<TE>   If that weren't enough, Kenney-Cash is in Seoul this week to watch
Lanny play for the World Cup. The Americans arrived with humble
hopes: They just wanted to reach the second round of the quadrennial
championship. Then the improbable happened. The U.S. team, which has
never won a World Cup match beyond the first round, squashed Mexico
with a 2-0 victory Monday--and one of those goals was courtesy of
Donovan.</TE>
<TE>   When the Americans face Germany on Friday--4:30 a.m. PST--
Kenney-Cash is ready to cheer her son and his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of surreal; you think this isn't really happening," she
said. "Only 3 1/2 years ago, he was playing high school soccer; this
has a dream-like quality."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, soccer wasn't Kenney-Cash's idea. She initially preferred
baseball. But when Landon was in preschool, his teachers suggested
soccer for the hyperactive boy, saying it would help burn energy.</TE>
<TE>   After games, she would ask whether he enjoyed himself, not whether
he won. Then she would ask whether he believed he played his best.
The game score was the last thing they discussed. Early on, it became
embarrassing that her son scored so many more goals than any other
child.</TE>
<TE>   "I was aiming for a more well-rounded individual than some of the
other soccer moms were," Kenney-Cash said. "I thought of soccer as a
learning experience."</TE>
<TE>   When Landon was in the third grade, she refused to allow him to
play in a tournament after he misbehaved at school. Other parents
were furious, telling her she was wrong to punish the entire team.
Several dads told her she wasn't "putting soccer first enough."</TE>
<TE>   Landon's abilities never earned him any slack at home. Landon, his
twin sister, Tristan, and their older brother, Josh, started doing
their own laundry at age 5. They rotated such chores as vacuuming,
washing dishes and mowing the lawn. Watching TV was forbidden from 8
a.m. to 5 p.m., and the kids couldn't play on Saturdays until their
rooms were clean. Landon, his mother said, became fastidious; his
room was often cleaner than hers.</TE>
<TE>   Kenney-Cash believes her son, who was running at eight months, is
a natural athlete. He aced baseball and basketball, she said, but
soccer was his sport because players "are always moving, and that fit
his personality of go-go-go."</TE>
<TE>   She believed soccer was his ticket to a college scholarship. He
was a straight-A student. At 15 and 16, he was a star on America's
Under-17 team. Then teams from Germany and England began courting in
the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   She was completely thrown when Donovan pitched a new idea: He
would play for one of Germany's top professional teams. At first,
Kenney-Cash refused to give her permission. He begged every day.</TE>
<TE>   After a year, she caved. She allowed her 16-year-old son to play
for Bayer Leverkusen, a premier German club team. She cried for two
days. The contract ended his chance for a college scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he was way too young," said Kenney-Cash. "But years
from now, I didn't want him saying, 'You destroyed my chances.' "</TE>
<TE>   At her insistence, his contract with Germany included a signing
bonus that would cover his college tuition if a soccer career didn't
work out. It also included air fare home. She sent him packages of
Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal and bottles of ranch dressing.</TE>
<TE>   America's star youth player spent most of his playing time on the
bench. He was lonely and homesick. If he had one or two days off, he
flew home to surprise his family, even for a handful of hours.</TE>
<TE>   For the last two years, Donovan, on loan from Germany, has played
Major League Soccer with the San Jose Earthquakes. In soccer circles,
he's credited with leading the previously undistinguished team to a
championship.</TE>
<TE>   This week, Donovan is again in the spotlight. And his mother is on
the sidelines. Not to bug him, but to egg him on. Kenney-Cash said
she doesn't get nervous before games. She just paces. "I don't care
if they win or lose," she said. "I just care about Landon."</TE>
<TE>   With the stakes so high, she worries about an on-field injury or
an attack by a terrorist or an irate fan. Like other soccer moms, she
has pregame rituals. She always washes her hair, and she wears
certain jewelry, mostly gifts from Landon: three necklaces (including
one with a gold soccer ball), two bracelets and four rings.</TE>
<TE>   For the World Cup, she brought along three of Landon's jerseys,
the ones she believes brought him the most luck, including the No. 13
he wore in the 2000 Olympics. It doesn't matter that Kenney-Cash, who
stands 4-foot-11, swims in her son's jersey.</TE>
<TE>   When she speaks about the upcoming game, she cannot help but sound
like the Ultimate Soccer Mom.</TE>
<TE>   "We already had our cake, and if we get anything else, it's
icing," she said. "We've already done remarkably well; win or lose, I
just feel like a winner."</TE>

<LD>Beverly Cheeseboro noticed that a horse crossing in South Pasadena
was labeled a "bridal" path. The spelling was later corrected but why
so soon? This is the month for weddings.</LD>
<LD>   And while we're at it: Clint McCarty saw a sign in a building
thanking visitors for their "patients," but the notice was
appropriate, in a way, since it was in a Fountain Valley hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Reverse snob appeal: I mentioned the Amsterdam eatery with a sign
that bragged about "lousy food and warm beer." Well, Byron Myhre of
Palos Verdes Estates found a modest grill in Salt Lake City (see
photo).</LD>
<TE>   Still on the restaurant beat ... : Lance and Becky Larsen of
Irvine spotted a restroom sign on Catalina Island that makes sense
when you realize it's for the Buffalo Nickel Restaurant (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Such a deal: I'm nervous about ordering products online
anyway--and even more so since Bob Lewicki of Blue Jay sent me the
bill he received (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   School daze: After examining the date on her parking stub at
Pasadena City College (see accompanying), Sarah Hall of South
Pasadena wrote: "I guess it's no wonder that some students feel that
school never ends."</TE>
<TE>   Anti-secessionist tunes: Karen G. phoned in her nomination of the
Four Seasons' "Let's Hang On (to What We Got)"--though I'm not sure I
could bear to hear that song one more time. Just repeating the title
was bad enough.</TE>
<TE>   Ooh L.A. L.A.: David Daniel of Encino recalled that James Taylor's
"JT" album included the song, "Honey Don't Leave L.A." OK, it was
about a lover departing for a place even more romantic than the
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The lyric goes: "Honey, don't leave L.A./That Riviera is so far
away/Begging you s'il vous plait/They don't know nothing down in St.
Tropez." But substitute "Reseda" for Riviera and "Sun Valley" for St.
Tropez and I think we have a hit.</TE>
<TE>   I hate uninvited guests, too! The police log of the Los Alamitos
News-Enterprise reported that a woman "refused to leave church
because the devil was in her house."</TE>
<TE>   It won't even demand a lawyer: The newspaper's police log also
carried an item about some youths who "left a dummy on the side of
the street, which police detained and brought to the station."
They'll never make it talk.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The restroom signs say "Monguys" and "Mongals" at
B.D.'s Mongolian Barbeque in Irvine.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Council to Consider Support for Living-Wage Policy</HD>
<DH>Labor: The plan would call for contractors to pay at least
$9 an hour, but some say an ordinance is needed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shying away from an ordinance, the Oxnard City Council has instead
agreed to consider adoption of a so-called living-wage policy that
would simply demand government contractors pay their workers at least
$9 an hour.</LD>
<LD>   The council voiced support Tuesday for a sweeping policy that
would be phased in over four years and include city employees at a
projected cost of $1.7 million. Health insurance benefits would not
be included.</LD>
<LD>   Living-wage advocates applauded the city's support to increase the
pay of low-wage workers. But advocates said they preferred an
ordinance that would require government contractors to pay their
employees more money before doing business with the city.</LD>
<TE>   "The living wage has won the day, but ... we will have to be
constantly vigilant for attempts to weaken it," said Maricela
Morales, spokeswoman for the Coalition for a Living Wage.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Manuel Lopez and Mayor Pro-Tem John Zaragoza said they also
favor a law over a policy.</TE>
<TE>   "The concern I have is, will [a policy] have any teeth?" Zaragoza
said. "How can we force contractors to do what the policy says?"</TE>
<TE>   Zaragoza said he will recommend the policy be approved with the
condition that a city-paid compliance officer and a volunteer
oversight committee be assigned as policy watchdogs. He said it makes
economic sense to increase the pay of the working poor.</TE>
<TE>   "The cost of sending kids to school, medical care, car insurance,
is tremendously high," Zaragoza said. "Ultimately, if people can't
afford these costs, we pay for them through social taxes and income
taxes."</TE>
<TE>   The council is expected to approve the new policy plan at its
meeting Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   During the first year of the policy, about 200 city employees and
four contract employees would be affected by the wage hikes,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next three years, another 100 city employees and 70 to 80
contract workers would see their wages increased.</TE>
<TE>   The intent of living-wage laws is to reduce poverty by mandating
pay for government workers and contractors that is higher than the
state's minimum wage. Such laws have been the source of debate, with
opponents saying they only serve to raise the cost of government
services.</TE>
<TE>   A split Ventura County Board of Supervisors approved a living-wage
law last year. That ordinance requires county contractors to pay
employees at least $8 an hour, plus health benefits, or $10 an hour
without benefits. The mandate only applies to contracts worth more
than $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   But in March the Ventura City Council voted 5 to 2 to reject a
similar law, saying the cost to the city would have ranged from
$400,000 to $800,000.</TE>
<TE>   Morales said a living wage is essential in Oxnard, where there are
8,700 households whose income is less than $20,000 a year, and 11,436
residents collect public assistance from the county.</TE>

<HD>Jack E. Cunningham, 80; Former Manhattan Beach Mayor,
Activist</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack E. Cunningham, 80, former mayor of Manhattan Beach, died
Saturday at Torrance Hospital of heart failure.</LD>
<LD>   Cunningham, who served on numerous planning commissions in the
South Bay city, was elected to the Manhattan Beach City Council in
1994 and later chosen by his colleagues as mayor. A popular promoter
of new businesses, he often pitched in to help--literally--as when he
learned to toss pizza dough for the grand opening of Tony Maroni's
Gourmet Pizza in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Active in many civic organizations, he helped found the South Bay
Youth Volleyball Club and worked with the Lions Club and the Culver
City YMCA.</LD>
<TE>   A lieutenant in the Coast Guard during World War II, Cunningham
later graduated from Loyola University and worked there as publicity
director, spending weekends and summers as a Los Angeles County
lifeguard. Later, he built a career in administration with Douglas
Aircraft and other aerospace companies, and also worked with printing
and graphics companies.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham was active in the Catholic Church throughout his life,
and organized a long-running Hollywood Bowl prayer service called
Mary's Hour while at Loyola. He later served as a eucharistic
minister at American Martyrs Church in Manhattan Beach and was a
member of the Knights of Columbus.</TE>

<LD>Rodney Hilton, 85, a British historian who wrote influential works on
the rise of capitalism and medieval peasant revolts, died June 7 at
his home in Birmingham, England. The cause of death was not
disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Among Hilton's best-known works are "Bond Men Made Free," a survey
of peasant unrest over several centuries, and "The English Peasantry
in the Later Middle Ages."</LD>
<LD>   He also edited and contributed to "The Transition from Feudalism
to Capitalism." It was written by a group of Marxist historians in
which Hilton was a leading figure. Their discussion led to the
influential journal of social history called Past and Present, now in
its 50th year.</LD>
<TE>   Hilton was born in Manchester, England, and joined the Communist
Party as a student at Oxford. He quit the party in 1956, but
continued to analyze medieval history from a Marxist perspective. He
taught medieval social history at the University of Birmingham from
1963 to 1982.</TE>
<TE>   He was known for encouraging students, many of whom went on to
produce work that bore his influence and who would later be called
members of the "Birmingham school."</TE>

<HD>John A. Murphy, 72; Brewing Chief Unveiled 'It's Miller
Time'</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John A. Murphy, 72, former president of Miller Brewing Co. who
introduced Miller Lite and adopted the blue-collar slogan "It's
Miller time," died Sunday in Glen Head, N.Y., of complications after
surgery for an aneurysm.</LD>
<LD>   Murphy joined Philip Morris, parent company of the country's
second-largest brewer, in 1962 as assistant general counsel. He was
named Miller president in 1971 and was credited with building the
Milwaukee company into a world-class brewer.</LD>
<LD>   With Miller Lite, he helped pioneer sales of beer with fewer
calories to increase the beverage's appeal to a younger, active
market. Former Miller President Warren Dunn called Murphy "the father
of Miller Lite." An affable, outgoing Irish American, Murphy also
liked the slogan "It's Miller time" and made it a familiar phrase
nationwide.</LD>
<TE>   Murphy served as Miller Brewing chairman of the board, then was
named president of Philip Morris in 1984. He became vice chairman of
the parent company in 1991, and retired the next year. South African
Breweries is now in the process of acquiring Miller from Philip
Morris.</TE>

<LD>The parents of a 7-year-old who police claim was molested by a city
recreation leader at an after-school care facility have filed a
$2.5-million claim against Newport Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Trenton Veches was arrested in April after a co-worker reported
seeing him sucking a child's toes. Authorities allege that Veches did
the same to dozens of children, sometimes photographing his actions.</LD>
<LD>   The claim alleges Newport Beach officials didn't check his
background thoroughly enough. Officials have said their checks before
he was hired found no arrests or record of inappropriate behavior.</LD>

operated by Vintage in Fillmore, Santa Paula and Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   In each incident, petroleum or petroleum residue reached the Santa
Clara or Ventura rivers, Deputy Dist. Atty. Laurel McWaters said.
Most of the spills were the result of corroded pipelines, she said.</LD>

<HD>Ex-Coach Convicted on 4 Sex Counts</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A former basketball coach at Ribet Academy in Los Angeles was
convicted Wednesday on four counts of having sex with a Glendale girl
who played on his high school team.</LD>
<LD>   A Superior Court jury in Pasadena found Paul Calvin Clark III, 34,
not guilty on eight counts and it deadlocked on four counts.</LD>
<LD>   Clark faces up to seven years in state prison for unlawful sexual
intercourse with a minor under age 16, penetration with a foreign
object and two counts of oral copulation. Sentencing is expected
later this summer.</LD>
<TE>   After deliberating since Monday, jurors told Los Angeles County
Superior Court Judge Michelle R. Rosenblatt they could not reach a
unanimous verdict on four counts: one each for penetration and oral
copulation and two for unlawful intercourse. So Rosenblatt declared a
mistrial on those charges only.</TE>
<TE>   The victim testified during the three-day trial that she willingly
had sex with Clark seven times last year. She was 15 then and playing
on his basketball team at Ribet Academy, a private school in the
Glassell Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Clark did not testify. His attorney argued during the trial that
two women who coached at Ribet resented Clark and coerced the girl to
lie about the relationship.</TE>
<TE>   After the verdict Wednesday, one juror said he and other jurors
agreed Clark and the girl had some sort of sexual relationship.</TE>
<TE>   But they could not fully match her testimony to statements she had
made before the trial to investigators, during a preliminary hearing
and during questioning by the other Ribet coaches, which the two
women videotaped.</TE>
<TE>   The girl "changed her story under various influences," said the
juror, who would not give his name. "We didn't know where the
influence took over versus where the facts took over."</TE>
<TE>   The girl's parents said Wednesday that they were disappointed the
jury did not find Clark guilty on all 16 counts.</TE>
<TE>   Clark had been charged on 17 counts, but the judge dismissed one
count after the girl testified.</TE>
<TE>   The verdict, the girl's father said, was "not complete. He doesn't
deserve that. He deserves more than that."</TE>
<TE>   Given the jury's mixed verdict, Clark's attorney, Robert M.
Bernstein, said he will petition for a new trial for his client on
the four convictions.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Andrea Austin said the her office will consider asking
for a new trial on the four counts on which the jury could not reach
a unanimous verdict.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Fresno City Council officially has opposed the local air
district's idea of moving the San Joaquin Valley into the
worst-polluter category for smog.</LD>
<LD>   The change in category could buy more time to achieve healthy air
and help the city avoid federal sanctions, which could cost millions.</LD>
<LD>   The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District was to
consider the matter at its meeting today. The district proposed
moving from "severe" noncompliance with a federal ozone standard to
"extreme" noncompliance. The only district in California in the
extreme category is the Los Angeles-area South Coast Air District.</LD>

<LD>Paradise Unified School District board meetings no longer will open
with a prayer after teachers and parents convinced trustees that the
Christian-based prayers made some people uncomfortable.</LD>
<LD>   Trustees also voted to not replace the prayers with a "generic"
prayer or moment of silence.</LD>
<LD>   A district teacher brought the issue to the board in October. But
trustees did not fully respond to the request until May, when
Teachers Assn. of Paradise President Tamara Connors wrote a letter on
behalf of several teachers who wanted the practice stopped or changed
to a non-denominational message.</LD>

<HD>Seabees on Philippine Mission Come Home to Port Hueneme</HD>
<DH>Military: Many had been deployed to Basilan Island, the
focal point of a U.S. effort to destroy a terrorist organization.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After months of clearing jungle and building airfields in support of
American Special Forces in the Philippines, members of the U.S. Navy
Seabees returned to a hero's welcome in Port Hueneme Wednesday
afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Busloads of Seabees were met by families and loved ones as they
rolled into a parking lot of Naval Base Ventura County. Leis were
draped around their necks, children latched onto their legs and wives
leaped into their arms.</LD>
<LD>   The 4th Naval Mobile Construction Battalion has been deployed
since December with many of its members sent to Basilan Island in the
Philippines since April.</LD>
<TE>   The remote island of rubber and coconut trees has been the focal
point of America's effort to help the Philippine military crush the
Abu Sayyaf terrorist organization, notorious kidnappers said to have
ties with Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda organization. The group
has taken Americans hostage, beheading one man from Corona.</TE>
<TE>   Two American missionaries were held captive for a year until
Philippine military units raided an Abu Sayyaf encampment earlier
this month. One missionary and a Filipino nurse were killed in the
attack. The other missionary was wounded, but survived.</TE>
<TE>   Amid this turmoil, the Seabees built bridges, dug wells, cleared
and paved an old 1941 airstrip and repaired almost 40 kilometers of
damaged roads.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions were so primitive that when Seabees needed gravel,
villagers would start breaking big rocks into smaller and smaller
rocks. When local women were hired to wash Seabee clothes, some used
a nearby river. Conventional telephones didn't work well, so the unit
was provided with satellite phones to call home.</TE>
<TE>   "We in the West are used to a certain level of infrastructure that
doesn't exist over there," said Lt. Cmdr. Rick Burgess, executive
officer of the roughly 600-member battalion.</TE>
<TE>   But their engineering and construction efforts were appreciated by
the local population.</TE>
<TE>   "We left behind a permanent reminder of what the U.S. military was
all about," said Petty Officer 1st Class Manuel Pulido, 37, of
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Villagers, mostly Muslim and Christian, rallied outside their camp
in support of the Navy mission.</TE>
<TE>   "They had signs that said 'We stand shoulder to shoulder with
you,' " said Petty Officer 2nd Class Frank Kaminski, 28, of Junction
City, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   Petty Officer 2nd Class Devron Felder, 24, said the infrastructure
work helped villagers realize there was an alternative to groups such
as Abu Sayyaf.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, the Seabees bulldozed 600 trees hiding a World War
II-era airstrip. They graded and extended it to 3,100 feet, allowing
its use by American and Philippine military forces.</TE>
<TE>   A 32-kilometer stretch of road, once so muddy and full of holes
that cars could bump along at barely 10 or 15 mph, was repaired.</TE>
<TE>   "They can now drive 55 mph," said Petty Officer 2nd Class Lyle
Jincks, 22, of Newport, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   But despite their focus on engineering projects, the unit was
keenly aware of the increased security threats against Americans in
the region. U.S. Marines helped provide security, but the Seabees
also carried weapons and trained constantly.</TE>
<TE>   "We build and we fight," Burgess said.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the Port Hueneme group left Basilan Island, its
former camp was fired on by unknown attackers, but there were no
casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Back home, wives read about the bloody raid on the Abu Sayyaf camp
and worried about their husbands.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept in contact with him by phone and letters," said Lisa
Pulido, wife of Manuel Pulido. "I cut out all the articles in the
paper about what was happening in the Philippines."</TE>
<TE>   Dana Lane nervously watched the news each night to see if anything
had happened to her husband Dillard.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so glad he's back," she said. "I haven't seen him since Dec.
4."</TE>
<TE>   The Port Hueneme unit soon will be replaced by Seabees from
Gulfport, Miss.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the elite fighting units waging war on terrorism, the
Seabees, who also have worked in Afghanistan, are often overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   "If we accomplish our mission, that's success," Burgess said. "Our
guys don't get in there to get the glory. They are there to work and
that's what they do."</TE>

<HD>Secession Election Challenged</HD>
<DH>Lawsuit: Attorney for city's largest union attempts to
block fall vote on Valley issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A top lawyer for Los Angeles' largest municipal union on Wednesday
served formal notice that he will file a lawsuit today aimed at
stopping the November election on San Fernando Valley secession.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Hunt, general counsel for the Service Employees
International Union's Local 347, served the notice on Valley
secession leaders, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and
the Local Agency Formation Commission, the panel that put the breakup
measure on the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   In his complaint, which he is bringing as an individual, Hunt
challenges LAFCO's finding that the creation of a Valley city would
not have a significant effect on the environment. The suit will ask
the Los Angeles Superior Court to prohibit the Board of Supervisors
from scheduling the election.</LD>
<TE>   Hunt contends that LAFCO violated the California Environmental
Quality Act by not studying in detail whether a Valley city would
have to construct more municipal buildings, hire more employees or
take other actions that would have an effect on the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Brain, president of the secession group Valley VOTE, said
Hunt's suit "lacks merit and the courts will see through this
political smoke screen."</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts, meanwhile, said that the courts generally are
reluctant to halt elections because of such legal challenges. Hunt's
complaint does not target the Hollywood secession measure, which is
also on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   SEIU officials are among the leading opponents of secession, but
they have said that the union would not go to court to try to block a
Valley cityhood vote. On Wednesday, they distanced themselves from
the suit, saying that Hunt was acting on his own. Representatives of
Mayor James K. Hahn, who is leading the anti-secession drive, also
said his office had nothing to do with the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Katz, who is chairman of the pro-secession campaign, said
that Hunt was too close to both city and union interests to be acting
independently.</TE>
<TE>   "Though Robert Hunt will file the lawsuit as an individual, it's
hard to overlook the fact that he's associated with a major municipal
employee union--the same union which is one of Mayor Hahn's strongest
supporters," Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   Fredric Woocher, an attorney who specializes in election law, said
it would be difficult to persuade a judge to stop an
election--especially based on complaints about an environmental
impact report.</TE>
<TE>   "Courts generally err on the side of letting people vote," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Oil Firm to Pay $120,000 for 10 Spills</HD>
<DH>Environment: Vintage Petroleum agrees to the penalties
without admitting wrongdoing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vintage Petroleum Inc. has agreed to pay more than $120,000 in
penalties stemming from 10 oil spills in Ventura County in the last
three years, the district attorney's office said.</LD>
<LD>   The spills, totaling about 3,100 gallons, occurred at wells
operated by Vintage in Ventura, Santa Paula and Fillmore. In each
incident, petroleum or petroleum residue reached the Ventura or Santa
Clara rivers, Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Laurel McWaters said
this week. Most of the spills were the result of corroded pipelines,
she said.</LD>
<LD>   Without admitting wrongdoing, Oklahoma-based Vintage agreed to a
final judgment, McWaters said.</LD>
<TE>   The settlement requires the company to pay $45,000 each into the
county Fish and Wildlife Propagation Fund and the state Fish and
Wildlife Preservation Fund, which support projects to protect local
habitats.</TE>
<TE>   Vintage will also pay $17,486 to the state Department of Fish and
Game for costs to investigate the 10 spills and $13,500 to repair
damage to natural resources caused by the spills, McWaters said.</TE>
<TE>   The company's Ventura County operation has a history of oil
spills, she said, including a similar case for multiple spills in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   "The hope is that this will help deter future oil spills,"
McWaters said. "They need to invest some money in their oil fields to
update their equipment so that these types of spills don't occur."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the company was ordered to pay $6 million in
damages to workers and their families for a 1994 oil field accident
that claimed three lives. That judgment stemmed from a civil case
filed by the victims' families, who alleged that the company's
negligence led to the accident.</TE>

<HD>Space Shuttle Touches Down at Edwards</HD>
<DH>NASA: Waved off from Florida by poor weather, Endeavour
lands at backup site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Facing possible bad weather in Florida, the space shuttle Endeavour
instead touched down safely Wednesday at Edwards Air Force Base in
the Mojave Desert.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not the place we intended to land, but this is a great
day here, and we brought back a good vehicle," Endeavour Cmdr. Ken
Cockrell said about landing at Edwards, the primary alternate landing
spot for space shuttles. "Everything is going well and we'll now go
through the effort of getting Endeavour back to Florida."</LD>
<LD>   The California landing means NASA will have to spend about
$900,000 to strap the shuttle to the back of a modified Boeing 747
jet and fly it to Florida for its next launch, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Endeavour, making its 18th flight, was scheduled to land Monday at
Florida's Kennedy Space Center, but light rain and the possibility of
thunderstorms delayed the attempt, said Doug Peterson, a spokesman
for Johnson Space Center in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Mission managers in Houston scrubbed two opportunities to land at
Kennedy early Wednesday, deciding it would be safer to land at
Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't want to take the chance because flying through rain
in the space shuttle is like flying through rocks," said Alan Brown,
spokesman for NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   The shuttle touched down at 10:58 a.m. Its return was heralded by
twin sonic booms that rattled Greater Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The landing was the 49th at Edwards since 1981. Space shuttles
primarily land at Kennedy Space Center.</TE>
<TE>   The shuttle departed June 5 from Florida to replace three crew
members on the International Space Station. Astronauts conducted
three spacewalks, one of them to replace the "wrist" on the 58-foot
robot arm being used to construct the space station.</TE>
<TE>   Two returning astronauts, Carl Walz and Daniel Burschv, set a
single-mission U.S. record with their 196th day in orbit Wednesday,
and another astronaut, Franklin Chang-Diaz, tied an American record
by making his seventh flight into space.</TE>

<HD>Bush Helps Simon on Oil Issue</HD>
<DH>Politics: GOP candidate gets a hearing on coastal drilling
cutbacks. The White House also steps into his campaign to oust a top
strategist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN and MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Moving on two fronts to bolster California's Republican
candidate for governor, the Bush administration on Wednesday gave
Bill Simon Jr. a national stage to assert leadership on the issue of
offshore oil drilling even as it forced the ouster of a top Simon
campaign aide.</LD>
<LD>   The administration, which has been criticized for its close ties
to the oil industry, also tried to raise doubts about Gov. Gray
Davis' commitment to protecting the coastline from drilling--picking
up a theme that Simon has been promoting for the past two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   With Simon dropping in at the White House, aides to President Bush
gave him a letter from Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton in which she
said that Davis had played a role in approving 193 offshore oil
wells. Davis aides said the governor had no legal discretion to block
the drilling.</LD>
<TE>   Simon then emerged from that session to tell reporters he had won
administration support to open talks on getting rid of oil rigs along
the California coast.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line really is that the Bush administration is willing
to sit down and talk about these issues," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   The White House's actions were welcomed by some GOP strategists,
who saw them as an indication of new-found engagement and interest in
California, where Bush has scrambled to find a toehold since losing
the state in a landslide in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "It reflects the reality that a lot of Republicans really do think
Simon can win and that opportunity wasn't being maximized," said one
GOP strategist in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   But aides to Davis dismissed the White House visit as a political
stunt. In response, they noted that Simon has invested in companies
that drill offshore and that the Bush administration has extensive
ties to the energy and oil industries. "I'm not so sure that
Californians want an oil-and-gas man like Bill Simon and an
oil-and-gas administration negotiating on offshore drilling in
California," said Davis reelection campaign spokesman Roger Salazar.</TE>
<TE>   "The most unfortunate part is that you have in the Department of
Interior an agency that seems more interested in scoring political
points for Bill Simon than it does in dealing with this issue
directly."</TE>
<TE>   Shake-Up of</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento Staff</TE>
<TE>   As Simon made the rounds Wednesday in Washington, a
behind-the-scenes shakeup was quietly taking place back at his
campaign headquarters in Sacramento. As with the Washington tour,
that move was orchestrated by the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Rogers, the strategist in charge of the campaign's day-to-day
operations, was ousted in favor of John Peschong, a veteran
California Republican Party operative and close ally of Gerald
Parsky, the Westside businessman who acts as Bush's chief political
emissary in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Sal Russo, Simon's top strategist and Rogers' partner in a
Sacramento consulting firm, described the move as a long-planned
change and denied any tensions with the White House, or between
factions within the Simon campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing everyone's united on is how important it is to
win," Russo said.</TE>
<TE>   But others, including some working for the GOP nominee, said the
move was forced on the Simon camp; one likened it to "a coup d'etat
from Washington."</TE>
<TE>   White House political operatives, including chief strategist Karl
Rove, have been privately critical of the Simon campaign, echoing
widespread concerns in GOP circles--shared, most critically, by some
of the party's biggest financial supporters.</TE>
<TE>   They complain that Simon has moved too slowly to build support
beyond his conservative base and is too passive in exploiting Davis'
perceived weaknesses. They also criticized Simon for failing to
respond immediately when Davis launched a multimillion-dollar ad
blitz two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Simon began airing his first TV spots earlier this week, but those
ads are airing exclusively on Spanish-language television.</TE>
<TE>   Doubts About Progress</TE>
<TE>   of the Campaign</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a lot of confidence in the White House with the
campaign," said one Republican strategist, who has discussed the race
with White House officials and described their concerns about "money,
message and the messenger."</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who helped Simon raise millions of dollars at a pair of
events in April, has agreed to return to California in August to help
raise more money.</TE>
<TE>   "But first their confidence level in the campaign has to be
higher," said the strategist, who described the shakeup as part of a
"carrot-stick approach."</TE>
<TE>   After his visit to the White House, Simon said, "I expect them to
pull out all the stops."</TE>
<TE>   The backdrop of the oil-drilling dispute is a federal court fight
over the 36 leases off the coast of Ventura, Santa Barbara and San
Luis Obispo counties.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is the role of California officials in reviewing new
oil-drilling plans in federal waters, which are at least three miles
from the shoreline.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis administration argues that federal law gives California
the right to make sure new drilling plans, or even the extension of
offshore oil leases, conform with state laws protecting air and water
quality, sea life and scenic views.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. District Court judge last June agreed, effectively blocking
new oil-drilling plans until they pass muster with the California
Coastal Commission. The Bush administration has appealed the decision
to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has called on the Bush administration to drop the appeal,
but Simon has not. Instead, Simon criticized Davis on Wednesday for
taking the issue to court in the first place and suggested the
conflict should be resolved in negotiations out of court.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the way Davis handles lots of situations, it's
often through an adversarial context as opposed to a collaborative
context," Simon said. "It's kind of his way or no other way."</TE>
<TE>   In October, the Bush administration floated a settlement proposal
to Barry Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Goode said federal officials were willing to buy back 13 of the 36
leases, if the state would drop its lawsuit and allow oil companies
to develop the remaining leases by various methods of slant drilling.</TE>
<TE>   But Goode said the governor's office dismissed the offer, because
Davis is unwilling to budge from his position opposing offshore
drilling in any new areas.</TE>
<TE>   Some Issues</TE>
<TE>   'Not Negotiable'</TE>
<TE>   "It was clear they were angling to allow some continued offshore
drilling," Goode said. "There are some things we will not negotiate.
We would not talk about how many unacceptable things we would
accept."</TE>
<TE>   These companies filed a breach of contract suit earlier this year
against the federal government over the delays and ever-changing
rules that have thwarted their ability to produce oil from the 36
tracts.</TE>
<TE>   One of those companies, Nuevo Energy Co., urged federal officials
last year to buy back these leases so the oil companies could recoup
their investments.</TE>
<TE>   California Resources Secretary Mary Nichols said the Bush
administration needs to negotiate with the oil companies that own the
offshore leases.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Bush administration has not embraced that idea, a few
weeks ago it cobbled together a similar deal promising $235 million
to buy back oil leases off the coast of Florida and in the
Everglades. The deal was criticized by some Democrats as an effort to
boost the November reelection chances of the president's brother Jeb,
the state's Republican governor.</TE>
<TE>   In her letter to Simon, Norton made a point of singling out Davis
for his role in approving 193 oil wells offshore, including 13 since
he took office as governor in 1999. The earlier cases stem from his
post on a state commission that oversees drilling permits.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis aides said that he--or in some cases his appointees--had
no choice but to approve those permits.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Hamilton, national conservation director for the Sierra
Club, said Davis "has been consistently against drilling offshore."</TE>
<TE>   "I think Bill Simon is the one who's the Johnny-come-lately here,"
he said. "But frankly, we're happy to have him on board."</TE>

<HD>Supervisors Considering End to County Police Force</HD>
<DH>Labor: Knabe and Antonovich see option after being ordered
to pay $60 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after a judge ordered Los Angeles County to pay a record sum of
$60 million in back wages to its in-house police force, county
supervisors said they might disband that department if their appeal
fails.</LD>
<LD>   County officials were still reeling Wednesday from the judgment,
which would pay the 500-plus officers from the Office of Public
Safety wages comparable to those of sheriff's deputies. On June 7, a
jury unanimously ruled that the county, in its compensation
practices, had discriminated racially against a predominantly
minority police force. The ruling benefits all the officers,
including white officers.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by Superior Court Judge Victor Chavez could cost the
county about $100 million in back wages and upgraded pensions, plus
an additional $140 million over the next 25 years in increased
salaries for public safety officers.</LD>
<TE>   While emphasizing that dissolving the police force was not being
advocated yet, supervisors Don Knabe and Mike Antonovich said that
would be a logical option if an appeal failed.</TE>
<TE>   "In the face of $100 million, disbanding is an option we have to
look at," Knabe said. "It has to be something that would be under
consideration: to eliminate them. I just consider this award just
outrageous. It's unbelievable to me that someone can rule against us
like this."</TE>
<TE>   Knabe said he was "not confident about an appeal. I was confident
we'd never be stuck with this kind of a bill in the first place."</TE>
<TE>   Antonovich said sheriff's deputies might have to take over patrols
at county facilities. And while some public safety officers might be
able to transfer to the Sheriff's Department, many might not qualify,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The sad part is that many people in the Office of Public Safety
could end up losing their position because of the action of their
union," which sued for the wage package, Antonovich said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the officers reacted angrily to talk of disbanding
the police force.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite frankly, this is really irresponsible and another public
policy decision being made, not on public safety or what's best for
the citizens, but just a knee-jerk reaction to being told they're not
getting their way," said attorney Patricia Bellasalma. "If they did
that, it would be just to get rid of officers they do not want to
pay. It would be another instance of showing their preference for a
majority Caucasian Sheriff's Department."</TE>
<TE>   She said the Sheriff's Department and county officials have long
portrayed Office of Public Safety officers as bumbling and as
security guards rather than police, to justify low pay.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, plaintiffs argued that sheriff's deputies and
Los Angeles police officers often perform duties like those of
security guards.</TE>
<TE>   The jobs public safety officers do "are dangerous," said the
plaintiffs' attorney, Jack O'Donnell. "Officers have been killed over
the years, and their families have gotten nothing."</TE>
<TE>   County officials have denied that race had anything to do with the
compensation for county police officers.</TE>
<TE>   Entry-level Office of Public Safety officers receive about
$30,000; deputies begin at $42,000. County police do not receive
safety retirement, a pension generally given to law enforcement
officers and firefighters. County lifeguards get safety retirement.</TE>

<KH>SURROUNDINGS / PERSHING SQUARE</KH>
<HD>In the Heart of Downtown, a Tranquil Oasis</HD>
<DH>The city's oldest park, with a faux pond and waterfall,
bold colors and cubist lines, draws an eclectic mix of people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Los Angeles can be summed up in a glance--if all its grandeur and
despair and history can be distilled into a single urban block--that
place might be Pershing Square.</LD>
<LD>   The city's oldest public park, founded before George Washington
took office, now sits bounded by office towers. It's had eight names
and nearly as many looks. The last restyling, nine years ago, gave
the park bold colors, cubist lines and a purple carillon that stands
128 feet high, topped by a large pink globe. It is the striking
centerpiece of a square with an equally unusual melange of people.</LD>
<LD>   They drift in from the posh hotels and law offices on Bunker Hill.
They pour off the crowded sidewalks of Broadway and the jewelry
district. They travel south from Chinatown, west from Little Tokyo.</LD>
<TE>   Lyndell Brady spends much of each day at Pershing Square. He
arrives on foot from a skid row mission. "This is my spot," the
50-year-old homeless man said from a shaded bench at the park's south
end. "I come here for my serenity ... my peace. I don't have anybody
bother me. I read the sports--it's great."</TE>
<TE>   Brady has a gray-flecked beard, quick eyes and hard-luck stories
that come off with little trace of self-pity. A back injury and a
crack cocaine habit cost him nearly everything. He inhabits hard
streets filled with injustice. While he was showering one morning,
someone stole his billfold. "There wasn't anything in it but my ID,"
Brady said, "but now I've got to go through the trouble of getting a
new ID."</TE>
<TE>   Pershing Square represents a choice he makes each morning. He
could spend his time at one of skid row's filthy corners, such as 5th
and Crocker streets, smoking crack or shooting heroin. But, he said,
"I've been there ... and it's not where I want to go. I come here
just to get away from what I call the 'rat race' down there."</TE>
<TE>   He avoids it by joining dozens of other homeless men--and a few
homeless women--who hang out at the park. Brady's chosen bench is
more than 100 feet long, a gallery of the destitute. Some sit and
talk, others sleep, cushioning their heads with bundles of clothes.
Most stare mutely at the scene around Pershing Square's central
fountain, a faux pond studded with cobblestones and freshened with a
thin waterfall.</TE>
<TE>   Tourists and families go by, pointing their cameras. Men
crisscross the courtyard in business suits. Dennis Dibos, a Motorola
executive visiting from Washington, D.C., moved more slowly than most
on a recent morning. A cigar wedged between his fingers, he strolled
past the fountain, seemingly lost in thought.</TE>
<TE>   Dibos was due to address a specially convened board involved in
setting technological standards among military-defense systems. It
took him a moment to clear those complexities from his mind when
asked to assess Pershing Square. He looked around as if seeing it for
the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, the architecture's beautiful," he said. "It's a nice place
to sit and smoke a cigar. It's kind of what I expected of downtown
L.A."</TE>
<TE>   The scene is a visual bombardment. Noon summer concerts draw
crowds that spill across the manicured main lawn, with people
clustering under bright market umbrellas and lining up like birds on
long walls and benches. During winter, an ice rink is set up for
skating. The ragged skyline extends the park's abstract design.</TE>
<TE>   Looming over the park from Olive Street on the west is the
majestic brick facade of the Biltmore Hotel. Taller brick towers
front the square from 6th Street on the south and Hill Street on the
east. Their rusted fire escapes hang far above the park's scattered
palms and gardens.</TE>
<TE>   Escalators beneath the carillon carry travelers to and from
Pershing Square's subterranean garage. At one corner of the park, a
Metro Rail station feeds the flow of sidewalk traffic. You can come
up from the train, cross the street and enter a monument area
containing a cannon from the warship Constitution, which fought the
British in 1812 and was known as "Old Iron Sides."</TE>
<TE>   Statues stand above the sleeping homeless. Ludwig van Beethoven is
here, placed in honor of William Andrews Clark Jr., founder of the
Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. The Philharmonic Auditorium stood
at Pershing Square for 75 years before it closed in 1964. Its long
list of entertainers and lecturers includes Mark Twain and Booker T.
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Other figures commemorate the dead of the Spanish-American War in
1898 and the veterans of World War I. A plaque placed in 1955 by the
"Woodmen of the World of Omaha, Neb.," whoever they were, honors
Pershing himself--Gen. John Joseph Pershing, a captain during the
Spanish-American War who became the commander of U.S. forces as World
War I raged across Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Pershing's marker rests on the rectangular base of a six-foot,
rust-colored sphere, one of several huge orbs of art that lie around
the square like oversized marbles. Law clerk Michael Peffer sat
beneath another of those spheres near the fountain, having lunch.
Having kicked off his wingtips, he faced the sun and affably greeted
a custodian passing on a motorized cart.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to get out of the office," Peffer said, amused by the
park's weirdness. "You've got Chester the molester over there,"
picking through the trash bin, he said jokingly. Peffer said he used
to think the art work was "pretty cool" until he got used to it.
"Now, I see people taking pictures, and I say, 'What are you taking
pictures for?' "</TE>
<TE>   Part of the answer may be that Pershing Square is so strikingly
L.A. Aldous Huxley must have concluded that. He moved here and
published a futuristic novel, "Ape and Essence," shortly after World
War II. It explored the aftermath of an atomic war. Mutant survivors
gathered in Pershing Square to warm themselves by burning library
books.</TE>
<TE>   Writer Carey McWilliams also found the square strangely
compelling. He recalled stepping outside one morning and hearing the
news boys crying the day's headlines. "An awful trunk murder had just
been committed; the district attorney had just been indicted for
bribery ... a University of Southern California football star had
just been caught robbing a bank ... and ... there was news about
another prophet, fresh from the desert, who had predicted the doom of
the city," McWilliams wrote in 1946.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, McWilliams said, he stopped to watch "a typical
Pershing Square divertissement: an aged and frowsy blond, skirt held
high above her knees, cheered by a crowd of grimacing and leering old
goats, was singing a gospel hymn as she danced gaily around the
fountain. Then it suddenly occurred to me that, in all the world,
there neither was nor would ever be another place like this City of
Angels. Here the American people were erupting, like lava from a
volcano; here, indeed, was the place for me--a ringside seat at the
circus."</TE>
<TE>   The passage is now etched on a wall behind the fountain, where
former chef Calmeze Barcus, now homeless, harbors his dreams of
opening a restaurant. "This is a place," he said, "[where] you can
come and get hold of your thoughts."</TE>
<TE>   Barcus sat ringside while Tim Joseph, a poet from Hollywood,
unlocked his bike and prepared for a spin on the nearby streets.
Joseph said he stops at Pershing Square whenever he is downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always an extreme mix of people," he said, a foot propped
on the pedal. "I think it has good energy. The energy just kind of
brings you here."</TE>

<HD>Arco to Pay $45.8 Million to Settle Tank Upgrade Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SCHOCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California officials on Wednesday announced a $45.8-million
settlement in a case against Atlantic Richfield Co. The oil company
was accused of failing to make required safety improvements in
underground tank systems at 59 service stations throughout the state.</LD>
<LD>   Arco, now owned by BP, has agreed to pay the state $25 million in
costs and penalties and said it has carried out an additional $20.8
million in upgrades not required by law. Those improvements mean that
all 1,178 Arco service stations statewide now exceed state
underground tank regulations, a BP spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Even on the day settlement papers were filed in San Francisco
Superior Court, key parties disagreed on some aspects of the case.</LD>
<TE>   The office of Gov. Gray Davis hailed the settlement amount as a
national record for a case of its kind. The oil company, however,
characterized it as a $25-million settlement, saying it had already
spent the additional money on the station upgrades.</TE>
<TE>   State officials said that, as part of the settlement, the oil
company still must demonstrate that it has spent the money on the
improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the stations are in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura
counties, including Malibu, Anaheim, Garden Grove, Simi Valley,
Culver City, Bellflower and Buena Park.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the settlement, state officials said that some of the 59
sites have been or are still contaminated with the gasoline additive
MTBE or other chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   California Environmental Protection Agency spokesman Bill Rukeyser
could not say late Wednesday afternoon how many of the sites are
still being investigated for contamination.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing in the settlement, however, "closes the book" on Arco's
potential liability if leakage is found to have occurred from delays
in tank improvements at the 59 sites, state officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "The complaint was about failure to upgrade. We didn't have to
prove leaks, and the settlement does not let anyone off the hook if
there are leaks" still not found, Rukeyser said in an e-mail response
to questions.</TE>
<TE>   "There is contamination at many of the sites, as there is at a
high percentage of stations in the state," said Will Brieger, a
deputy attorney general who worked on the Arco case for two years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not alleging that these violations caused that
contamination specifically."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the service stations with chemical leaks already have been
cleaned up and some will be cleaned up in the future, Brieger said.</TE>
<TE>   Ground water contamination occurred at some sites, he added. State
officials could not give a specific count Wednesday, but Brieger
said, "Their potential liability for those problems has not been
resolved."</TE>
<TE>   The state in 1987 gave gasoline stations 10 years to comply with
tougher standards meant to prevent corrosion and spills and to detect
leaks from underground tanks. The state claimed that Arco failed to
perform required upgrade work at 59 stations by the deadline and
continued selling gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   BP spokeswoman Cheryl Burnett said the company has been working
with the state for two years on the issue. She disputed several
points stated in a news release from the governor's office, saying it
misrepresented Arco's actions.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no evidence that because of this issue there's been any
contamination. The state's been by our side on this," she said,
adding, "It's been a long two years. We want to move ahead with it."</TE>

<LD>The parents of a 7-year-old boy who police say was molested by a city
recreation leader have filed a $2.5-million claim against Newport
Beach, saying the city should have done more to check the man's
background.</LD>
<LD>   The parents said at a news conference that the city should have
done more than a criminal check before hiring Trenton Veches to
supervise the city's after-school community recreation youth
programs.</LD>
<LD>   Veches was arrested in April after a co-worker reported seeing him
crouched in front of a boy, sucking one of the child's toes.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities have alleged that Veches sucked the toes of dozens of
children, sometimes photographing his actions.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach officials did not return several calls seeking
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Officials previously said that they conducted a background check
on Veches before he was hired and found no arrests or record of
inappropriate behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "The city needs to use any available tool to find out about a
person, especially if they are dealing with kids," said Abdul
Alkayali, the boy's father, who consented to be identified.</TE>

<LD>A popular youth program will continue for another two months, Ventura
County officials announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The El Rio Police Activities League was set to close July 1
because of budget cuts, affecting the 500 young people who belong to
the group.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor John Flynn and Sheriff Bob Brooks said they have agreed
to share the cost of paying Deputy Claudia Duffner, who runs the El
Rio program, through Aug 31.</LD>
<TE>   Flynn's share of the $15,000 will come from private foundation
funds his office has raised through the years, and Brooks will cover
the other half from the department's budget.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn said he and other program supporters will spend the next two
months continuing to raise private donations and searching for grants
to keep the program alive.</TE>
<TE>   The league organizes supervised sports leagues, dances and other
activities for youths, and is the only group offering after-school
programs in a $3-million community gym that opened last year.</TE>

<LD>The City Council has adopted the city's 2002-03 budget after making a
change aimed at providing more money for the arts.</LD>
<LD>   At its meeting this week, the City Council, at the urging of Mayor
Ray Di Guilio, took $100,000 from the council's contingency fund and
redirected $75,000 to augment grants and fellowships for Ventura
artists.</LD>
<LD>   The remaining $25,000 will go to the Ventura County Museum of
History and Art.</LD>
<TE>   Council members also considered raising water rates by about 9%
and sewage rates by about 12%. The new rates would take effect July
29 if adopted at the council's next meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The council discussed raising other city fees but did not take
action.</TE>
<TE>   Increased fees would provide about $400,000 for the council's
discretionary budget.</TE>
<TE>   The fee increases will be discussed July 22.</TE>

clear the tracks and was struck, according to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Romero suffered blunt trauma to his pelvic area and legs,
authorities said, and was admitted to Community Memorial Hospital in
Ventura.</TE>

<HD>EPA May Tighten O.C.'s Sewage-Dumping Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal officials proposed Wednesday adding strict conditions to a
permit that allows Orange County to dump partially treated sewage
into the ocean. The change, which would require the district to put
bleach in all waste water, would take effect in August.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposal by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
water quality would be monitored from the beach to three miles
offshore, and from the water surface to the ocean floor. The county
agency's current permit requires monitoring only 10 feet deep and
three miles out for pollution caused by the 243 million gallons of
sewage that the district pumps into the ocean every day.</LD>
<LD>   The changes would provide "more stringent protections," said Robyn
Stuber, an environmental scientist for the EPA. She noted that the
EPA can modify a permit at any time.</LD>
<TE>   The state Water Board, which regulates the sanitation district,
will meet July 19 to consider the permit changes. The sanitation
district can appeal the decision, but such action is unlikely,
officials said Wednesday. If the changes are adopted, the district
will start using chlorine bleach Aug. 12 to disinfect its waste
water.</TE>
<TE>   "We welcome these modifications," said Robert P. Ghirelli,
director of technical services for the sanitation district. "We
wanted to take the extra step."</TE>
<TE>   The district has had the permit since 1998, but laws passed since
then set a higher purity standard for waste water pumped into the
ocean. A waiver that expires next year allows the agency to discharge
water that is more polluted than the national standard. The district
has said it has not yet decided whether to seek renewal of the
waiver. Several Orange County cities are opposed to an extension,
among them Huntington Beach, which has suffered frequent shoreline
closures because of high bacterial counts in the water.</TE>
<TE>   Though adding bleach to waste water will cost the sanitation
district more than $8 million a year, that is still cheaper than
building facilities that would provide secondary sewage treatment and
would bring the district more in line with the national standard.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental activist Doug Korthof said the chlorine remedy aims
to divert attention from the district's decision on whether to apply
for renewal of its waiver and helps it skirt responsibility for a
sewage plume off Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   A problem with chlorination is that it can cause toxic hydrocarbon
mixes and also does not kill viruses, "which can stay viable for much
longer than bacteria," he said. "And some bacteria encapsulated in
grease and oil has remained live for 20 years off Santa Monica."</TE>

<LD>   A Clark County judge reduced bail for a former California high
school teacher charged with kidnapping a 15-year-old student and
having sex with him in Las Vegas.</LD>
<TE>   "Perhaps $280,000 is excessive," Clark County District Judge
Joseph Bonaventure said before reducing bail to $74,000 for Tanya
Joan Hadden, 33.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Clark County Public Defender Jordan Savage said outside
court that it was not clear whether Hadden could post bail. Hadden

kidnapping, six counts of statutory sexual seduction and 12 counts of
sexual conduct between a teacher and a student.</TE>

<LD>   Three Union Pacific freight trains collided near North Platte,
injuring four crew members and igniting a fire that shut down a
Nebraska highway.</LD>
<TE>   The fire may have been caused by diesel fuel from the train
engines, railroad spokesman Mark Davis said. The fire was doused two
hours after the 4:30 a.m. accident, and no hazardous material was
involved.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the six crew members suffered minor injuries, Davis said.
The trains were hauling a total of 275 cars.</TE>

<HD>Vote Broadens Use of 'Soft Money' by State Parties</HD>
<DH>Politics: U.S. election commission narrows definition of
'solicit,' among other moves. Critics argue new law is effectively
weakened.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FINEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Federal Election Commission on Wednesday adopted a series of
amendments that critics, including two of the six election
commissioners, said would significantly weaken the ban on "soft
money"--the unlimited contributions to national political
parties--that was the centerpiece of this year's landmark
campaign-finance reform act.</LD>
<LD>   In a marathon session to approve regulations that will implement
the law, the commission's three Republicans and a single Democrat
went beyond even the FEC's legal staff in further narrowing key
definitions in a voluminous set of draft rules that the act's four
congressional sponsors already had contended would water down their
law.</LD>
<LD>   As an example, just before the commission recessed for the night,
its members voted 4 to 1, with one abstention, to narrow the
definition of the word "solicit" so that it means only "directly
ask." Under this definition, recommendations or suggestions for a
contribution, as well as an array of other approaches, would not be
covered by the ban.</LD>
<TE>   "This definition has the potential for great mischief," Lawrence
Norton, the FEC's general counsel, told the commissioners before they
voted.</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting, Don Simon, general counsel for the
public-interest group Common Cause, said: "This is a definition that
defies common sense and allows parties and federal officials to
continue to solicit soft money as long as they are careful not to use
the word 'ask.' "</TE>
<TE>   Hours before, the commission did cede to the four sponsors on one
basic provision of the law. They rejected a Republican-sponsored
amendment that reform advocates said would have continued to permit
the political-attack advertising that has drawn much of the
reformers' criticism and consumed the bulk of the soft-money
contributions, often in the hundreds of millions of dollars, raised
by the parties from corporations, labor unions and other special
interests in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   So contentious and prolonged was Wednesday's debate that the
commission did not adjourn until close to midnight, as it attempted
to address additional amendments and all other provisions in the 318
pages of final draft regulations. The members will resume their
deliberations this morning.</TE>
<TE>   But throughout Wednesday's debate, the commission, which not only
is making the rules but will later interpret and enforce them, did
take on some of the most controversial provisions, which the law's
authors opposed. And the session underscored the deep political and
philosophical divisions between the legislators who wrote the
bipartisan campaign reform act and the regulators who must frame it
in law.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the commission met, President Bush joined fellow
Republicans at the Washington Convention Center a few blocks away,
taking advantage of current regulations--which expire Nov. 6, the day
after election day--to raise more than $30 million for the party's
congressional and senatorial campaign committees.</TE>
<TE>   On the eve of the FEC session, the law's chief sponsors--Sens.
John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.) and Reps.
Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) and Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.)--warned
the commission that they would be watching closely, and that the
bill's ban on soft money would be "fundamentally undermined" by
watered-down definitions.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to such criticisms, Commissioner Bradley A. Smith, a
Republican who wrote extensively against campaign-finance reform
before he was appointed to the FEC, opened the meeting Wednesday by
lashing out at what he called "the paranoia and the hysteria" that
the soft-money rulemaking has engendered among the law's sponsors and
the "self-styled reformers" who support them.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of their agenda is to abolish" the FEC, Smith said. "They
have a vested interest in denigrating everything we do."</TE>
<TE>   On the Democratic side, long-serving Commissioner Scott E. Thomas
countered that "the battle" over the rulemaking is "whether we will
somehow undo the statute [the lawmakers] had worked to pass."</TE>
<TE>   And several times during Wednesday's debate, Thomas warned that
some of the amendments were doing just that--opening loopholes for
future evasion of the soft-money ban.</TE>
<TE>   Smith sponsored several of those amendments, which broadened the
ways in which and local political parties, committees and candidates
can use unregulated soft money for election activities that may
affect federal candidates and elections as well.</TE>
<TE>   The reform act was meant to ban all soft money in the federal
election system and even regulate it at the level when it could
affect "federal election activity."</TE>
<TE>   In seeking to narrow the definitions of that federal activity,
Smith, his Republican colleagues and Democrat Karl J. Sandstrom, who
cast the tie-breaking vote on several of those amendments, argued
that broad definitions of such activities as voter registration
drives would have a chilling effect on grass-roots politics and would
violate basic principles of federalism.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not going to allow more soft money into the system,"
Smith said of his amendment. "Congress knew there would still be soft
money in the system."</TE>
<TE>   Arguing against another amendment sponsored by Sandstrom that
would, in effect, permit state and local candidates or committees to
use soft money to compile voters' lists, Commissioner Thomas argued,
"As a matter of policy, I think we're going in the wrong direction."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to head off, before it's too late, some of these easy
vehicles for evasion of the legislation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want us to start going down that slippery slope," Thomas
added.</TE>
<TE>   But on the key issue of narrowly defining the rules governing
attack ads, Smith backed off an amendment that would have created
broad exemptions to the ban on any advertisement or communication
that "promotes, supports, attacks or opposes" a candidate for federal
office.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's final draft rules put off a decision on whether
to further define the phrase.</TE>
<TE>   The law's sponsors had asked the FEC not to specify a definition.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's Republican chairman, David M. Mason, promised to
hold additional public hearings in the future if the FEC does further
define that phrase. He added: "There are no nefarious intentions nor
secret plans on the part of any of the commissioners--there's no plan
afoot here to hide the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Republican Michael E. Toner, who was appointed to the FEC recently
by President Bush after serving as chief counsel to his presidential
campaign, concluded: "We have done exactly what the [law's] sponsors
have urged us to do."</TE>
<TE>   On balance, Paul Sanford, a former FEC attorney and director of
FEC Watch, a reform-minded group that is monitoring the commission,
said, "I think we're going to end up with a lot narrower a statute
than what its sponsors thought it should be.</TE>
<TE>   "We will have less soft money in the system than we have now, but
there will be more than the sponsors of the statute wanted."</TE>
<TE>   During the afternoon recess, Thomas observed: "I would say the
high-water mark for the McCain-Feingold legislation was about 10:05
this morning, before we started the discussion."</TE>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The crash of a Marine Corps plane into a mountainside in Pakistan
that killed seven Marines was caused by flight crew error, but might
have been prevented if the plane had been equipped with night-vision
equipment, a Marine investigation concluded Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The KC-130 Hercules transport and refueling aircraft crashed Jan.
9 while attempting a night landing at Shamsi, Pakistan, when the air
crew "lost awareness of their position" and did not realize the plane
was too low to clear a mountain range that rings the military
airfield there, according to the report.</LD>
<LD>   The crash remains the deadliest accident during the U.S. war on
terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   The plane, flown by Marines from Miramar Marine Corps Air Station
in San Diego, did not have the night-vision equipment the Marine
Corps has since ordered installed in many of its KC-130 planes.</TE>
<TE>   The equipment might have allowed the pilot, co-pilot, navigator
and flight engineer to realize the plane was headed toward the
mountain while banking left on its approach to the airfield,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It may have helped," said Col. Randolph Alles, commanding officer
of Marine Aircraft Group 11. "We just don't know."</TE>
<TE>   In Redding, the mother of the pilot, Capt. Matthew W. Bancroft,
said the report adds to the family's grief but does not diminish
their pride in his military service.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been preparing for this, but it still hurts," Beverly
Bancroft said. "You think you're just starting to heal, then it
starts all over again. The people who knew Matthew and flew with him
knew what a good pilot he was.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever the circumstances, they all died in the service of their
country," she said.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the crash, the Marine Corps had night-vision
equipment on nine of its KC-130s, eight of which are part of reserve
squadrons in New York and Texas. The planes sent to support combat
operations in Afghanistan did not have the equipment.</TE>
<TE>   But Alles and other officers noted that other KC-130s previously
had landed at the same airfield at night without problems.</TE>
<TE>   The crew was experienced and rested and had flown before into
Shamsi, near the Afghanistan border.</TE>
<TE>   The night was moonless but clear.</TE>
<TE>   Although asserting there is no connection to the crash, the Marine
Corps this year began training crew members in the use of
night-vision goggles and retrofitting KC-130 planes so that their
display terminals can accommodate the goggles. The retrofit requires
that cockpit display lights be modified, so they do not appear
blurred to crew members wearing goggles.</TE>
<TE>   The KC-130s have been packhorses to support the Marine Corps
thrust into Afghanistan, ferrying fuel, supplies and troops to Camp
Rhino--a former Taliban facility seized by the Marines--and to the
war-torn airfield at Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   "There was obviously a mistake made there in a high-demand
environment," Alles said. "It happens in aviation."</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, Bancroft asked for permission to land at
the main runway at Shamsi. But because of noise concerns from a
neighboring Pakistani village, a Marine Corps air traffic controller
told Bancroft instead to use a second runway with a different
approach.</TE>
<TE>   Alles said guidelines call for planes operating in such conditions
to climb to 7,000 feet, then maneuver for a long, straight approach.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Bancroft banked left and tried for what pilots call a
"short" landing.</TE>
<TE>   The plane struck the mountain at an altitude of 3,800 feet--200
feet short of the altitude needed to clear the ridge.</TE>
<TE>   Officials speculated that the crew may have been cutting corners
because they were behind schedule and had two other stops.</TE>

<HD>Crusader Project Not Dead Yet</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Maneuvering to save jobs and technologies threatened by
a planned cancellation of the Crusader howitzer, the Senate struck a
compromise Wednesday that allows the Army to wrap up a study of its
artillery needs before the Pentagon kills the $11-billion project.</LD>
<LD>   The White House dropped a threat to veto any bill that overrode
the Pentagon's bid to scrap the weapon without further delay so long
as it could shift funds to other programs once the Crusader is
canceled.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters of the Crusader, being developed by United Defense
Industries Inc., hope that while the Army is finishing its study,
probably by September, there will be time to work out a plan to save
many of its technologies and jobs, and apply them to the lighter,
more mobile systems the Pentagon wants.</LD>
<TE>   Doug Coffey, a United Defense spokesman, praised the Senate action
as finally giving the big, 155-millimeter gun "the kind of detailed
analysis it deserves."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a recognition that the decision to cancel was hasty," he
said. The Senate approved the Crusader compromise as it worked
through a $393-billion defense authorization bill for next fiscal
year that starts Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The Crusader has been in development since 1994 at a cost so far
of $2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   It was to be ready for the field by 2008, but Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld last month abruptly announced the 40-ton cannon
was too big.</TE>
<TE>   That set the stage for a potential showdown over the
administration's ability to kill a weapon that had strong support
among defense hawks and lawmakers from Oklahoma and Minnesota, where
many of the jobs related to it were based.</TE>
<TE>   But with this vote, as well as with a defense budget bill moving
through the House Appropriations Committee, both sides may duck the
fight.</TE>

<HD>White House Evacuated When Small Plane Enters Airspace</HD>
<DH>Security: The Cessna pilot apparently got lost and failed
to contact air controllers soon enough, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The White House was briefly evacuated and military jets scrambled
Wednesday night after a small plane flew through restricted airspace
near the executive mansion.</LD>
<LD>   The Cessna aircraft landed in Richmond, Va., about 100 miles from
Washington, and law enforcement officials said it appeared to be
simply a case of a pilot who got lost.</LD>
<LD>   The plane came within four miles of the White House, Secret
Service agent Brian Marr said. Authorities said the plane belatedly
made contact with air traffic controllers at nearby Reagan National
Airport.</LD>
<TE>   President Bush had returned to the executive mansion 20 minutes
earlier from a Republican fund-raiser when some staff members and
reporters were ordered to leave the building shortly after 8 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Bush remained in the White House throughout the incident but was
protected by unspecified security procedures, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   A man in a dark suit hurried through the White House press area
saying, "Get out, get out, everybody out. Secret Service says
everyone has to leave the building."</TE>
<TE>   Not all White House staff members left.</TE>
<TE>   The incident occurred only hours after staff members at the
Federal Reserve, including Chairman Alan Greenspan, were evacuated
from that building on nearby Constitution Avenue after a suspicious
package was found in a garbage bin. Police cordoned off several
blocks, delaying traffic during the afternoon rush hour. The package
turned out to be harmless.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities were interviewing the Cessna pilot, who had flown from
a small airport in Massachusetts and had not made required radio
contact as he approached Washington, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The plane approached from the northeast above the capital at
10,500 feet, well below the minimum 18,000 feet required for the
restricted space, federal aviation officials said. The restriction
applies to a 15-mile radius around Reagan National Airport just
outside of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Two F-16 military jets were immediately sent out, and they
followed the plane until it reached Richmond.</TE>
<TE>   The White House evacuation lasted about 15 minutes, ending as soon
as the plane changed direction, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy flew out of Gardner, Mass., airspace," said Petty Officer
Beverly Allen of the North American Aerospace Defense Command. "We
escorted the guy to Richmond Airport, where authorities apprehended
him."</TE>
<TE>   Gardner is a city of about 21,000 in central Massachusetts about
50 miles west of Boston. The plane was headed for Raleigh, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   "This just looks like a pilot that had no clue he was entering
restrictive airspace," said Marr, the Secret Service agent.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday night's evacuation of the White House was the first
since Sept. 11, when the building was thought to be a target of one
of the hijacked jetliners used in the attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Four commercial airliners and a medical helicopter have crossed
into prohibited airspace protecting the White House since Sept. 11,
Federal Aviation Administration officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots have flown through the prohibited airspace protecting the
White House at least 94 times over the past decade.</TE>

<HD>A Relentless Fire Chars Evacuees' Hopes, Psyches</HD>
<DH>Colorado: Self-sufficient residents, now living out of
their cars in a parking lot, feel powerless.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WOODLAND PARK, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Most of the weary stragglers squatting on this high school parking
lot are at their wits' end, beaten down by the tyranny of a wildfire.</LD>
<LD>   Some already know their homes are burned to the foundations,
others merely fear it. They're living out of their Chevys, they're
grubby, their children cranky, and still the fire comes.</LD>
<LD>   The ferocious Hayman fire has for 11 days shoved families out of
their houses. By Wednesday, more than 8,900 people from Colorado's
heavily forested midsection were on the move. Some ended up at this
barren lot in front of Woodland Park High School.</LD>
<TE>   "What's it like? I can't begin to put it in words, the heartache
and the pain of sitting here every day and looking at that ridge and
that smoke and not knowing if it's your house or your neighbor's
house that's burning," said Debra Butler. She has been camped here
for nine days with her husband, their two children and two massive
dogs they refuse to put in a kennel.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure we can keep doing this," Butler said, gazing fondly
at the two panting dogs occupying the front seat of the family car.</TE>
<TE>   Even this temporary refuge is not safe. The town, seven miles from
the fire's edge, is under an evacuation warning. The Hayman fire has
burned 136,000 acres and is still erupting, driven by hot, dry winds.</TE>
<TE>   The squatters have gathered here for more than a week, creating a
makeshift community of tents, campers, recreational vehicles and cars
packed to the roof with family treasures.</TE>
<TE>   Extended families huddled their vehicles together, neighbors found
each other and ordered their camps so they have the same next-door
neighbor here.</TE>
<TE>   Adults sit in lawn chairs, sharing coffee and stories. Children
frisk on the blacktop as if it were their new frontyard. Boys with
sticks in their hands build forts under pickups. A little girl
wearing a surgical mask steers a pink bike with training wheels. She
rides up to a stranger and flips up the mask. "It stinks!" she
declares, and waves a pudgy arm at the curtain of thick smoke that
has descended on this bustling mountain town.</TE>
<TE>   The parking lot is filled with proud, self-sufficient mountain
folk who can't manage to accept the Red Cross' hospitality, available
at the school across the street.</TE>
<TE>   Of the thousands displaced, the Red Cross reports fewer than a
hundred are spending the night in its shelters. The evacuees have
dispersed to the homes of friends, family or small hotels on the
fringes of the burn area.</TE>
<TE>   The Butlers fled their mountaintop home June 11, directed here by
sheriff's deputies. They soon found Sherri Humphrey and her family.
Neighbors. The families arranged their assortment of tents, trucks
and campers together and have relied on each other since.</TE>
<TE>   Coping with bored children, increasingly unhealthful air and the
general uncertainty has worn Humphrey's nerves raw. She cries easily
and apologizes profusely.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had it," she said, sitting on a concrete parking barrier and
sighing. As she watched her two young children, she said quietly that
she knew she didn't have the luxury of crumbling.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at me, I'm camping in a high school parking lot. You never
think your life will be like this, you see disasters on television
and never think it could be you. Wow."</TE>
<TE>   The parking lot denizens watch the movement of clouds, closely
monitoring the weather. Each wind shift can mean a subdivision comes
under threat. In particular, they keep an eye on a young aspen
sapling staked in a grassy median. Its shimmering leaves tell the
wind's direction, and thus, the fire's path.</TE>
<TE>   "This poor little tree," Humphrey said, petting its trunk. "We
look at it and it brings us hope. But if it bends the wrong way,
we're gone. It's so bad, always running away from your home."</TE>
<TE>   Across the parking lot, Joe Elliott is elbow-deep into the side of
his trailer, replacing a hot water sensor. His family has been here
eight days. The worst part for them, he says, is all the people.</TE>
<TE>   "We're used to being up in the mountains by ourselves," he said,
picking up a screwdriver and gesturing. "It's tough to get used to
the people."</TE>
<TE>   Without friends or family to impose upon, Stephanie Willett-Shaw
has relocated to an inexpensive motel with her cat, Sparky, and a
twin bed full of possessions.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time she's run from fire.</TE>
<TE>   After she lost everything in an apartment fire in San Francisco,
Willett-Shaw moved to Colorado to start anew. She bought a hilltop
home on 5 acres with a view of the mountains and the valley below.
She planted a garden with strawberries, lilacs and herbs, and started
looking for a job as an office manager at a law office.</TE>
<TE>   Within four weeks of moving to Colorado, three fires erupted
within 10 miles of her house on Night Hawk Hill near Sedalia, south
of Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Hayman fire roared in.</TE>
<TE>   "There were big chunks of charcoal falling out of the sky. The sun
was a weird copper red all day, it was the creepiest thing I've ever
seen," she said. By nightfall on June 9, everyone in her area was
ordered to leave.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Willett-Shaw stayed with a friend of a friend. For
nearly a week she's been languishing in a $47-a-night Super 8 hotel
room in Castle Rock, surrounded by boxes of artwork (her own oil
paintings), clothes, important papers, pillows, blankets and food.</TE>
<TE>   Her run of hard luck stopped at no luck at all. The fire's will
had broken hers.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe I'm in this situation. It doesn't seem real,"
said Willett-Shaw, who is 59 and single. "I was thrilled to make a
new start, to be brave and adventurous and come out here and start a
life. Now it seems that my life is in shambles despite every effort
to pull it together. I hardly know anybody here, I have no job, no
home, no family. I can't describe it. This is truly a nightmare."</TE>
<TE>   Like many evacuees, Willett-Shaw is bored. At dawn, she's often at
the nearby Wal-Mart trolling the aisles, just for something to do.
The rest of the day she watches TV, naps, worries about the future.</TE>
<TE>   At night, she sleeps in her clothes in case she has to make a fast
exit. "I left a high-paying job in San Francisco, bought a car that
could handle the Colorado winters and spent $4,000 having my stuff
moved out here," she said. "Now, here I am sitting in a tiny hotel
room with my cat.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, I want to get out of here and not just out of this
hotel. I want out of Colorado. I feel I'm absolutely stuck. I still
own the house, but who would want to buy it? They'd have to be
insane.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the fire will reach my house. But it has reached my
psyche."</TE>
<TE>   Times researcher Lianne Hart contributed to this story.</TE>

<HD>Forest Service Worker Indicted in Wildfire</HD>
<DH>Probe: Grand jury says the 18-year employee deliberately
sparked the Hayman fire that is ravaging Colorado.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>A federal grand jury indicted a U.S. Forest Service employee
Wednesday on suspicion of "maliciously" setting the blaze that
sparked the largest wildfire in Colorado history.</LD>
<LD>   "These counts reflect the government's contention that the Hayman
fire was deliberately set," said U.S. Atty. John W. Suthers. "Beyond
that, we cannot and will not go into specifics regarding the
defendant's intent or motive."</LD>
<LD>   Terry Lynn Barton, 38, was charged with setting fire to timber in
a national forest, damaging federal property, injuring a firefighter
and using fire to commit a felony.</LD>
<TE>   The fire began June 8 in the Pike National Forest. Authorities say
Barton, who was patrolling the forest for violators of the state's
open-fire ban, confessed that she set fire to a letter from her
estranged husband. The small blaze in a fire ring quickly set nearby
grass and brush alight, she allegedly told authorities, and she was
unable to extinguish the flames. Barton was arrested Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say they don't believe her story. Some investigators
speculate that Barton--an 18-year Forest Service employee who has two
teenage daughters--may have deliberately set the fire so she could
single-handedly put it out and become a hero.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted of all the charges, Barton could face 65 years in
prison and $1 million in fines.</TE>
<TE>   She is scheduled for a bond hearing today.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, President Bush on Wednesday declared the fire-ravaged
parts of Colorado as federal disaster areas, paving the way for
low-interest loans and temporary housing.</TE>
<TE>   The Hayman fire grew again Wednesday, spreading to 136,000 acres
after a day of hot, dry winds. The Missionary Ridge fire near
Durango, in southwest Colorado, also expanded, to 53,800 acres.
Residents in 18 subdivisions were evacuated.</TE>

<HD>Two Al Qaeda Messages Were Intercepted Sept. 10</HD>
<DH>Intelligence: Missives indicated imminent attack, but
official says they were too vague.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER, JANET HOOK and ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>One day before Sept. 11, U.S. intelligence officials intercepted two
messages from Al Qaeda operatives indicating that ''tomorrow is zero
day'' and ''the match begins tomorrow,'' but the communications were
not translated until after the attacks on the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon, Bush administration officials confirmed Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The communications, apparently phone calls in Arabic between Al
Qaeda operatives, were vacuumed up by the enormously powerful
electronic listening posts operated by the National Security Agency,
the ultra-secret intelligence-gathering apparatus that is supposed to
be the nation's ears around the globe.</LD>
<LD>   But they were not translated until Sept. 12, officials said,
prompting a new round of questions on Capitol Hill about whether the
U.S. intelligence community missed another warning sign.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, reflecting the continued state of heightened alert
since the terrorist attacks, the capital was rattled Wednesday by
separate incidents that resulted in brief evacuations of the Federal
Reserve and the White House.</TE>
<TE>   One Bush administration official defended the NSA, saying the
information could not possibly have prevented the deadly terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   ''Obviously, it would have been nice to have it three or four days
before'' Sept. 11, said the official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. But, he added, ''there was no specificity there. It was
just a time frame. It didn't tell you where.''</TE>
<TE>   The official also said that in the weeks and months before Sept.
11, the U.S. intelligence community already had a wealth of
information that Al Qaeda was planning something, which had led to a
heightened state of alert worldwide. But, he said, all indications
were that the attack would be overseas, and the vague threat probably
would not have resulted in a dramatic increase in domestic security.</TE>
<TE>   ''If we had gotten it earlier,'' the official said of the
intercepts, ''we would have locked down everything
overseas--embassies and military installations--because that's where
the threats were coming from.''</TE>
<TE>   James Bamford, an expert on the NSA and author of a current
best-seller about the agency, said that if the intercepted
communications were between top Al Qaeda leaders, ''I could see where
it would be a problem if it took several days to translate that. If
it was a lower-level Al Qaeda person on the fifth rung or something,
then that's far more forgivable.''</TE>
<TE>   The existence of the intercepts, which were first reported by CNN,
came up during hearings Tuesday and Wednesday before the joint House
and Senate intelligence committees investigating the events of Sept.
11, and whether the terrorist attacks could have been averted.</TE>
<TE>   The NSA's director, Air Force Lt. Gen. Michael V. Hayden, was
questioned at length about the two intercepts during the closed-door
hearings. He was also asked about whether communications problems
among intelligence agencies, a shortage of language specialists and
the NSA's delays in translating and analyzing intercepted
communications helped make the nation vulnerable to terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   ''There was considerable concern that this wasn't translated until
two days later,'' said a congressional aide, who said the joint
intelligence committees learned of the intercepts at least a week
ago. The aide, who asked not to be identified, said that the two
Sept. 10 intercepts hinting at action the following day are believed
to have originated in Afghanistan. It was not clear, the aide said,
whose conversations were intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   But several U.S. intelligence officials insisted that the language
in the messages did not indicate an attack on U.S. targets.</TE>
<TE>   ''It could have been a plan to attack the Northern Alliance,''
said one intelligence official. "It could have been a plan to go
after something in Africa, Asia, China or nothing at all. So what
would you have someone do about something as generic as that?''</TE>
<TE>   The intelligence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that ''far more ominous'' messages have been intercepted ''on
scores of occasions'' both before and since Sept. 11 and ''nothing
has happened."</TE>
<TE>   ''It doesn't mean you ignore it,'' he said. ''But something like
this is not actionable intelligence you can do something about.''</TE>
<TE>   Interpreting cryptic, and often coded, communications from
terrorist groups and sympathizers around the world presents a vast
challenge to intelligence authorities. The NSA's dozen or so major
listening posts receive about 2 million pieces of communications each
hour.</TE>
<TE>   For much of 2001, in fact, the NSA and the CIA had been receiving
a crescendo of intercepted ''chatter'' and threats indicating an
imminent attack. U.S. officials closed embassies around the world
last summer and fall, and tightened security at military bases and
other facilities in the Persian Gulf and the Far East.</TE>
<TE>   ''This was an example that something was up,'' the official said
of the Sept. 10 calls. ''But it doesn't tell you where it was, what
it was or how we could stop it.''</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said last fall that Osama bin Laden had telephoned
his wife and his mother in Damascus, Syria, on Sept. 10. He
reportedly urged his wife to return to Afghanistan, and told his
mother she would not hear from him for a long time.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence intercepts immediately after Sept. 11 showed that Bin
Laden's associates had taken responsibility for the attacks,
officials said last fall. They also said communications after the
attacks indicated a second and possibly third wave of attacks might
be imminent.</TE>
<TE>   The intelligence committee hearings lasted until late Wednesday
afternoon as members peppered Hayden, as well as CIA Director George
J. Tenet and FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III., with questions.
Rep. Ray LaHood (R-Ill), a member of the committee, said that the
committee had decided to postpone two days of public hearings next
week.</TE>
<TE>   ''We're not ready,'' LaHood said. ''We want to make sure when we
go public that the right people are there and we're prepared so that
we don't look like we're flying by the seat of our pants.''</TE>
<TE>   A Senate aide, however, said the panel's leaders would meet today
to decide whether to postpone or cancel next week's hearings.</TE>

<HD>Police Criticized for Few Results on Missing Girl</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Utah officials release more details on the
suspect in Elizabeth A. Smart's abduction but give no indication they
are closer to an arrest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>With no apparent progress in solving the kidnapping of 14-year-old
Elizabeth A. Smart, police here are now finding themselves on the
defensive.</LD>
<LD>   Even as Police Chief Rick Dinse was telling reporters Wednesday
that he remained confident that a suspect would be found, a local
radio talk show host was baiting listeners to call in and criticize
the two-week investigation as "shabby."</LD>
<LD>   The criticism wasn't lost on the police.</LD>
<TE>   "We're taking some hits, and all we can do is shake our heads,"
said Sgt. Fred Louis, a spokesman for the Salt Lake City Police
Department. "We're a proud department, a professional department."</TE>
<TE>   But other than offering a more detailed description of the
suspect, elicited from Elizabeth's 9-year-old sister, authorities
have offered no other indication they are on track to arrest a
suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Police say that Mary Katherine Smart feigned sleep and witnessed
her sister's abduction from their shared bedroom while other family
members were asleep.</TE>
<TE>   "We have pretty thoroughly allowed her to recall the information,"
Dinse said Wednesday. "She hasn't wavered a bit. Mary Katherine has
been a great witness."</TE>
<TE>   A joint police-FBI task force of more than 100 investigators is
culling through more than 8,000 tips. Of the 1,300 most promising
ones, about 400 have yet to be pursued, Dinse said.</TE>
<TE>   An "A" list of suspects--persons convicted of sex offenses--has
been exhausted, Louis said, and investigators are refocusing their
efforts on persons who live or work in the upscale, hilltop
neighborhood where the Smart family lives. Investigators are also
looking to those who know the family for possible leads.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of our leads have taken us two or three steps" toward a
suspect, Louis said. "We're looking at some people closer and closer,
dissecting them. We have eliminated some suspects, and we're starting
to narrow our search."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's press briefing was contentious, with reporters
expressing annoyance that previously released information about the
case has proven inaccurate. On Tuesday, for instance, police updated
their description of the suspect, who initially was described as a
white man, about 5-foot-8, with dark hair, wearing a light jacket and
a light baseball hat.</TE>
<TE>   Based on four interviews with Mary Katherine, police now say they
are looking for a white man in his 30s, with dark hair on his arms
and back of his hands, wearing tan pants, a light polo shirt, and a
flat, tan golfing hat.</TE>
<TE>   Consistently, he has been described as soft-spoken and nice but
carrying a handgun.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the earlier description was quickly gathered from
information the 9-year-old gave her parents. It was released within
hours of the abduction, without benefit of police first interviewing
the girl.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, it also was reported that the abductor threatened the
younger girl if she didn't remain quiet, leading her to not tell her
parents for about two hours that her older sister had been kidnapped.
Police now say Mary Katherine pretended to be asleep and heard the
abductor demand that Elizabeth remain quiet.</TE>
<TE>   As the man and Elizabeth walked down a hallway, Mary Katherine
sneaked another look--and fearful he was still in the house, remained
quiet for two hours, police now say.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives are not disclosing what other evidence or information
they've obtained in the investigation, but Dinse hinted that
investigators have more to go on than just the physical description.</TE>
<TE>   "We aren't telling you everything we know about the investigation,
and we aren't going to until we're further along," Dinse said.</TE>
<TE>   Louis said there is no composite sketch of the abductor because
the 9-year-old was unable to sufficiently describe his facial
features. He also said police have declined offers from more than 100
psychics to help in the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Dinse said some of the tips have been useless--including one from
Michigan in which a person claimed to have spotted the suspect. For
all the frustration among authorities and the community over the
apparent lack of progress, other law enforcement experts say they are
not surprised the investigation seems to be moving slowly.</TE>
<TE>   "This case may never be cleared, through no fault of the police,"
said D.P. Van Blaricom, a former chief of police for Bellevue, Wash.,
who now testifies at trials dealing with police malpractice. "I've
had people disappear who we never found."</TE>
<TE>   As they have throughout the last two weeks, Elizabeth's parents
Wednesday remained upbeat, even through tears.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I've spoken to you," Ed Smart told reporters, "I feel
in my heart she is alive and waiting to be found. My wife and I feel
very strongly she is alive. We pray all the time, and we feel the
prayers of others."</TE>
<TE>   Said Lois Smart, addressing her daughter directly: "Elizabeth, I
think of you every minute of the day."</TE>

<HD>'Motherly Love' Cited in Sons' Deaths</HD>
<DH>Courts: Friends say Carol Carr, who faces two counts of
murder, shot the adults to end their suffering from Huntington's
disease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GRIFFIN, Ga.</DL>
<LD>"I believe y'all are looking for me," were the first words out of
Carol Carr's mouth.</LD>
<LD>   She was waiting on a couch in the nursing home lobby when the
police came. She had just shot her sons, first Andy, 41, then Randy,
42.</LD>
<LD>   Carr had reached the end of her rope, plagued for years by a demon
of an illness, Huntington's disease, and couldn't stand the sight of
her boys wasting away in soiled sheets, unable to talk, move or even
swallow.</LD>
<TE>   Now she faces two counts of murder.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Carr will be led into a courtroom in this small Georgia
town, with its rusty old bridges and blooming magnolia trees, for
what many here said was the ultimate act of motherly love.</TE>
<TE>   "She decided to go to jail for the rest of her life rather than
watch her boys suffer like that," friend Debbie Henry said. "That was
her sacrifice."</TE>
<TE>   Not far away, Carr's surviving son sits in his living room with a
blank look on his face.</TE>
<TE>   He's got the disease too. So might his 12-year-old daughter.
There's a 50% chance.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been cursed," said Jimmy Carr, 38.</TE>
<TE>   The Carrs' story brings attention to a bleak, degenerative
condition that stalks families from generation to generation,
attacking brain cells until sufferers are reduced to thin piles in
bed.</TE>
<TE>   More than 25,000 Americans have Huntington's disease. And there's
no prevention or cure.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the cruelest diseases out there," said Frances
Saldana of Fountain Valley, whose three children have the disease.
"It attacks your dignity and respect. And when people see someone
yelling or jerking around or drooling, they don't feel sympathy for
them, like a cancer or leukemia patient. They just want to get away.</TE>
<TE>   "Her spirit must have broken," Saldana said of Carr.</TE>
<TE>   The 63-year-old Carr is in jail and has not spoken with reporters
since her arrest.</TE>
<TE>   She was born in Atlanta, the daughter of a factory worker. When
she was 20 years old, she married into a Huntington's family. Hoyt
Carr was a mattress maker, with meaty hands and a big chest. His
mother was in a mental hospital. At first, no one knew what was wrong
with her. They thought she was going senile because of her memory
loss, mood swings and diminished coordination.</TE>
<TE>   Hoyt's mother died in 1965, and later doctors made the connection
that she had Huntington's disease. By that point, Carol had given
birth to three boys.</TE>
<TE>   Hoyt's brother was the next to go. He shot himself in 1977 when he
started to come down with symptoms and couldn't work.</TE>
<TE>   Then Hoyt started to slip. The disease hit him when he was 45, the
typical age for onset of the disease, although it can come much
earlier. His moods grew dark and he would yell over nothing. Then he
forgot things. Then he started twitching.</TE>
<TE>   "It was horrible," said Carol's sister-in-law Janelle Scott. "To
watch a strong, handsome man turn into what he was, it ruined Carol."</TE>
<TE>   Hoyt died in 1995. Carol spent 15 years watching his condition
deteriorate. But the suffering would continue.</TE>
<TE>   That same year, Randy and Andy started to get the shakes. Because
it is hereditary, half the children of Huntington's sufferers get the
disease.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't long till they were all, all, all messed up," Jimmy
said.</TE>
<TE>   (Sometimes, the words get stuck. Jimmy's in the first stage of the
disease.)</TE>
<TE>   First Randy was sent to a nursing home. Two years later, Andy
joined him.</TE>
<TE>   The guilt began to tighten around Carol's heart. "Carol would sit
there and cry and cry and tell us she should have never brought
children into this world," Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, her friends don't think she went to the SunBridge nursing
home in Griffin the night of June 8 intending to kill.</TE>
<TE>   Carol always carried a gun, a little gray .25-caliber automatic.
She kept it in her purse and said it was for protection for all the
driving she did, sometimes late at night. That night, Carol had come
with a carton of chocolate milk. It was Andy's favorite.</TE>
<TE>   But when she walked into his room, she found Andy writhing in bed,
pulling at his catheter, his cheeks soaked with tears.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when she just lost it," said Henry, who said Carol
recounted the episode to her.</TE>
<TE>   According to police, Carol shot both sons in the head--they shared
a room--and then walked into the lobby and waited for the officers to
show up.</TE>
<TE>   Today, she plans to ask for bond; her lawyer said she's not a
danger to anyone. "She didn't kill those boys," said attorney Virgil
Brown. "The disease did. They were dead years ago."</TE>
<TE>   There's no assisted-suicide law in Georgia. But Brown said there
are lesser charges, such as involuntary manslaughter, that the grand
jury could indict her on when it convenes in August.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Brown has received countless offers of help for woman with
the nightmare of a life.</TE>
<TE>   One Georgia talk show host even volunteered to sign the jail bond
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Times researcher John Beckham contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Fla. Woman Who Burned Teen Daughter Sentenced</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A Florida woman who poured gasoline on her teenage daughter and set
her on fire in a fit of jealousy over a man was sentenced to 50 years
in prison, court officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Scott Silverman sentenced Maria Tarrago
to the maximum penalty allowed by law.</LD>
<LD>   "To describe your actions as depraved, despicable, heinous or
cruel would simply be an understatement," Silverman told her.</LD>
<TE>   Tarrago, 41, could have been sentenced to as little as six years
in prison. She was convicted in March of attempted second-degree
murder, aggravated child abuse and evidence tampering.</TE>
<TE>   She acknowledged pouring gasoline on her then-15-year-old
daughter, who caught fire as Tarrago flicked a cigarette lighter. But
she told the judge she only meant to frighten the girl and that the
fire was an accident.</TE>
<TE>   Her daughter, now 18, was burned over 23% of her body and badly
disfigured on her face, ears, arms and upper body.</TE>
<TE>   She testified that her mother became enraged when she returned
home from school on Dec. 6, 1999, with the mother's boyfriend. "I
will teach you a lesson you will never forget," Tarrago said, and set
her on fire, the daughter testified.</TE>
<TE>   Tarrago was originally charged with attempted first-degree murder.
Under that charge, the act is considered premeditated and is
punishable by life in prison. Jurors convicted her of attempted
second-degree murder, finding that she acted impulsively.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Budget Adds $1.50 to Cigarettes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- City leaders struck a $42.3-billion budget deal Wednesday
night designed to close a $5-billion shortfall in the wake of an
economic recession and the World Trade Center attack.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiators for the City Council and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg
agreed on a package to raise $400 million in new revenues by
increasing the cigarette tax, fees on cell phones and fines for
parking tickets.</LD>
<LD>   Another group of provisions that would have included a commuter
tax and an absentee-landlord tax, which had been advanced by the
council but opposed by Bloomberg, was not part of the deal, according
to city officials.</LD>
<TE>   The tentative pact, which still requires approval of the full City
Council, concludes months of often tense negotiations between the
Bloomberg administration and council to find ways to bridge the
budget gap, which was exacerbated by the Sept. 11 terrorist attack.
Council approval is expected later this week.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the tremendous challenges we faced this year we were able
to fulfill our responsibility to this city by passing a budget that
is fair, compassionate and does more with less," Bloomberg said.</TE>
<TE>   City Council Speaker Gifford Miller called the deal "the first
step in a long road toward restoring fiscal stability in this city."</TE>
<TE>   The resolution of budget negotiations comes after the city missed
two deadlines this month to pass a spending plan.</TE>
<TE>   The budget relies heavily on borrowing and cuts to programs and
city agencies, including the police and fire departments.</TE>
<TE>   The plan minimizes cuts to cultural institutions.</TE>
<TE>   It also calls for glass and plastic recycling to be rescinded for

<HD>House Panel Endorses Guns in Cockpits for Airline Pilots</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Test program wins approval after pressure from
fliers. It faces key opposition in the Senate, however.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Heeding arguments from pilots that they should be the "last line of
defense" against airplane hijackings, a key House committee on
Wednesday approved a test program allowing them to carry guns in the
cockpit.</LD>
<LD>   Although a number of aviation security measures have been enacted
since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Bush administration had
decided against letting pilots arm themselves.</LD>
<LD>   But pilot unions responded with intense lobbying on Capitol Hill,
and on Wednesday the House Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee's aviation subcommittee approved a measure to create the
two-year trial program in which up to 2% of airline pilots--an
estimated 1,400--would be trained and deputized as "federal flight
deck officers" with authority to carry arms in the cockpit. Flight
attendants would receive self-defense training under the bill.</LD>
<TE>   The subcommittee's approval makes it likely that the full House
will pass the measure. But it faces an uncertain fate in the Senate,
where the chairman of the Transportation Committee, Sen. Ernest F.
Hollings (D-S.C.), adamantly opposes the arming of pilots.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has not taken a position on the proposed
program, and the bill's backers are hoping that the White House can
be persuaded to back it.</TE>
<TE>   In a decision announced last month, the Department of
Transportation rejected requests to let all pilots carry guns.</TE>
<TE>   The agency contended that pilots should concentrate on flying the
plane and leave the job of fending off hijackers to federal air
marshals. One of the security-related laws enacted since Sept. 11 has
significantly increased the number of marshals assigned to flights.</TE>
<TE>   But pilots inundated Congress with e-mails, letters and phone
calls, arguing that guns in the cockpit were a necessary part of
heightened aviation security. Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.) even
received e-mails sent by pilots while flying, pressing their case.</TE>
<TE>   "Of all the people who look at aviation security, there's no one
that has more experience than a pilot," said Rep. John L. Mica
(R-Fla.), the subcommittee chairman. "Each day they see and they know
the weaknesses of the system, and they are asking to arm and defend
themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans are leading the charge against the administration's
decision.</TE>
<TE>   But a number of key Democrats have joined them, saying that guns
in the cockpit might be necessary because of the time it will take to
put other security measures into effect.</TE>
<TE>   "Until we reach a point where we have a high level of confidence
in our passenger screening system, I believe that [pilots have] got a
very strong case to make," DeFazio said.</TE>
<TE>   Pilot unions applauded the panel's action. Duane Woerth, a
Northwest Airlines captain and president of the Air Line Pilots
Assn., said the legislation was necessary "in light of the fact that
our aviation security system is evolving."</TE>
<TE>   But Patricia Friend, international president of the 50,000-member
Assn. of Flight Attendants, complained that the legislation has "14
pages on cockpit defense, and a page and a couple of sentences on
cabin defense." She said the bill failed to specify what kind of
self-defense training flight attendants should receive.</TE>
<TE>   Details of the test program, such as the type of firearms that
could be used and where they would be stored, would be left to the
Transportation Security Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots would have to undergo background checks, and those who have
served in law enforcement or the military would receive preference to
participate in the program.</TE>
<TE>   Under the measure, airlines would have no say about their pilots
carrying guns. The measure would shield airlines and pilots from
liability for any damages from pilots' using guns in response to a
threat.</TE>
<TE>   A number of airlines have lobbied against firearms in cockpits.</TE>
<TE>   But on Wednesday, American Airlines spokesman John Hotard said,
"We're going to do whatever the federal government instructs us to
do."</TE>
<TE>   United Airlines, which has ordered 1,300 nonlethal Taser guns, is
seeking the administration's approval to arm its pilots with the
electric weapons.</TE>
<TE>   After a rash of hijackings in the 1960s, pilots were permitted to
carry guns if their airline agreed. The program was in effect until
July, when the Federal Aviation Administration rescinded it. While
the program was in force, only a small number of pilots armed
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The number of air marshals assigned to planes is classified. But
in advocating the test program, Mica said it is known that there are
not enough marshals to put one on every plane.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, our aviation system is in a vulnerable stage of
transition and will be for some time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The subcommittee approved the measure on a voice vote.</TE>
<TE>   Those opposing it included Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas),
who said, "If a hijacking occurs, pilots must concentrate on
maintaining control and landing the plane safely as soon as possible
and not on confronting terrorists with weapons."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Ellen O. Tauscher (D-Alamo) asked, if arming pilots is such a
good idea, "why wouldn't this [panel] insist that every cockpit and
all passengers be protected equally?"</TE>
<TE>   "These security measures should benefit everyone, not just those
passengers who are on board an airplane with a pilot who happens to
be volunteering to carry a weapon that day," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tauscher favors arming pilots with nonlethal weapons.</TE>

<HD>Dust May Be the Stuff of Planets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- A sun-like star just out of infancy has winked at
astronomers, indicating its eclipse by cosmic dust and rocks, the
stuff of which planets like Earth could possibly form, scientists
reported Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The star, located in the constellation Monoceros, is 2,400
light-years from Earth. It disappeared from view for regular periods
of about 48 days over the past six years, astronomers said. Its
disappearance suggested an eclipse, but not a typical one caused by
an intervening planet, star or moon.</LD>
<LD>   Astronomers said only a collection of smaller objects, such as
dust and rocks, could cause the long eclipses they saw.</LD>
<TE>   Known as KH 15D, the star is about 3 million years old--young by
stellar standards, and a prime age for monitoring by astronomers
investigating our solar system's past by exploring analogous regions
of the universe visible today.</TE>
<TE>   "We've monitored thousands of these stars over the years, and this
is the only one that behaves this way," said astronomer William
Herbst of Wesleyan University, in Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   "Essentially the star winks at us," Herbst said at a meeting on
extrasolar planets at the Carnegie Institution in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The dust that caused the "wink" is different from the fine
interstellar dust that is distributed throughout the cosmos, Herbst
said. Its particles are bigger, indicating that it is clumping into a
proto-planetary disk--from which planets can form.</TE>
<TE>   "Is there a mass in here that is somehow sculpting the obscuring
clouds so that it's producing these rings of material which then
circle around the star and alternately block the object? We think
that's very possible," Herbst said.</TE>
<TE>   There could be two blobs circling the star, or just one, but there
is no confirmation yet of what could be causing this kind of disk to
form, said Herbst's colleague Catrina Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   At 3 million years old, KH 15D is much younger than the star at
the center of our solar system--the sun, which is about 4.5 billion
years old. It is generally established that the solar system's
planets formed when the sun was a few million years old.</TE>
<TE>   The disk in Monoceros is forming quite close to KH 15D, closer
than Mercury is to the sun.</TE>
<TE>   "The star is ... like the sun was when it was 3 million years old,
so the processes that are going on in this inner disk region, where
terrestrial planets would be forming ... could be analogous to what
was going on with the formation of Earth," Herbst said.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery was made with a relatively small, 24-inch telescope,
so it could well be the subject of scrutiny with larger instruments.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this gives us a whole new window into how planets form,
and it's one that a lot of astronomers will be trying to exploit with
their telescopes in the next few years," said NASA astronomer Steve
Maran.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this object might turn out to be something of a Rosetta
Stone for deciphering some of the mysteries of planet formation,"
said Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SPOKANE, Wash.</DL>
<LD>A man was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of building a homemade
biological weapon with a lethal toxin from the castor plant, the FBI
said.</LD>
<LD>   FBI agent Norm Brown said there was no known connection between
the man, Kenneth Olsen, and terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   Olsen, 47, was allegedly making ricin, a deadly extract of castor
beans. Traces of ricin have been found by U.S. troops in Afghanistan
at suspected Al Qaeda biological weapon sites, Brown said.</LD>
<TE>   The Spokane County Sheriff's Office began investigating Olsen last
August and the FBI later became involved, Brown said. There was no
sign of a bomb in the man's house.</TE>

<HD>Airport Security Agency Criticized for Office Costs</HD>
<DH>Bureaucracy: Democrats call the $400,000-plus space a waste
for taxpayers, but a spokesman says that's the price of safety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The new federal agency in charge of airport security spent more than
$418,000 renovating the offices of its top leaders, in what
Democratic lawmakers charged Wednesday is an example of government
waste creeping into homeland defense.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the House
Appropriations Committee, called on President Bush to rein in the
$6-billion Transportation Security Administration, which is rapidly
becoming the largest federal law enforcement agency.</LD>
<LD>   In Washington, public spats over office funding usually signal
deeper problems. On the eve of the Appropriations Committee hearing
Wednesday, Obey said TSA's security blueprint was ''chaotic,
incredibly expensive and bureaucratically top-heavy.'' The
Appropriations Committee sets agency funding levels.</LD>
<TE>   Transportation Department spokesman Chet Lunner rejected the
Democrats' contention that taxpayer money was wasted on the
renovation.</TE>
<TE>   ''This sounds purely political,'' Lunner said. Some of the costs
involved shielding the offices to handle sensitive security matters,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   John Scofield, spokesman for Republicans on the Appropriations
Committee, declined to comment on the office reconstruction. However,
he said, GOP lawmakers are worried about the agency's overall
spending.</TE>
<TE>   ''To be quite honest, there is a bipartisan concern on the fiscal
management,'' Scofield said. ''They are spending at a level that
we're not comfortable with. We don't view this as a political issue,
but as stewardship of taxpayer resources.''</TE>
<TE>   Lunner said the 3,100-square-foot suite houses TSA chief John W.
Magaw, his deputy and nine others. The space is on the 10th floor of
the Transportation Department building, where Secretary Norman Y.
Mineta also has offices. Many other senior TSA staffers have
temporary offices in a federal building across the street.</TE>
<TE>   The General Services Administration, which oversees federal
buildings, has some guidelines for how much an executive can spend on
refurbishing a personal office, but none for such an extensive
project that involves work space for 11 people, said a spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Obey is not known as a critic of government spending, said David
Williams, a spokesman for the watchdog group Citizens Against
Government Waste. ''My first reaction is you have to consider the
source,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, more than $418,000 for new offices sounds ''ridiculous,''
Williams added. ''How do you improve security by having cushy
offices?''</TE>
<TE>   A breakdown of the costs, released by Democratic lawmakers, showed
the major expenses were $235,260 for construction, $109,490 for audio
equipment, $41,879 for phones and communications and $22,481 for
security equipment. The security equipment included $826 to replace
the front-door lock.</TE>
<TE>   ''If you walk into it, it's not that different from the rest of
the building,'' said Lunner, the Transportation spokesman. ''They had
higher requirements. They needed solid walls, not movable partitions.
It's not that exciting a place.''</TE>
<TE>   But David Sirota, a spokesman for the Democrats on the
Appropriations Committee, said committee staffers who inspected the
facilities concluded that the agency had gone overboard. ''It
underscores the point that this agency is horribly mismanaged,'' he
said. ''It's not a partisan thing.''</TE>

<HD>Deportation Hearing Closed</HD>
<DH>Law: A public bond proceeding for Muslim student in Arizona
would compromise FBI's anti-terror efforts, judge rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Phoenix ruled Wednesday that a bond hearing for an
outspoken Islamic student facing deportation will be held in closed
session to safeguard the FBI's methods of investigating terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Acting on an unprecedented request by attorneys for the INS,
Immigration Judge Scott M. Jefferies agreed that a normally routine
hearing for Zakaria Soubra, 26, will be held behind closed doors
Monday. The judge also granted the INS' request that all parties to
the case be prohibited from disclosing any information discussed or
presented at the hearing in Florence, Ariz., just outside Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   While several closed proceedings have been held in other
terrorism-related cases since the attacks in New York and at the
Pentagon on Sept. 11, court officials said Wednesday's order
represented the first time a deportation hearing has been closed--and
all details of the case sealed--under a federal court regulation
unveiled last month by U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft.</LD>
<TE>   In court papers, INS attorneys said disclosure of the contents of
sealed affidavits from federal investigators would "compromise United
States interest in enforcing federal immigration law and the ongoing
investigation of terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Soubra, an outspoken Lebanese national, has been held in INS
custody since May 23 for allegedly violating his immigration status
as a college student by falling below the minimum number of credits
required in a semester.</TE>
<TE>   He also is one of the eight alleged Middle Eastern extremists
named in the "Phoenix memo" written by Phoenix-based FBI agent
Kenneth Williams in July 2001 warning that Islamic extremists were
enrolling in U.S. flight schools.</TE>
<TE>   In the sealed affidavits presented to Jeffries, both Williams and
Andrew G. Arena, chief of the FBI's International Terrorism
Operations Section, requested that Soubra's hearings in the
deportation case be closed.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have not alleged any links between Soubra and the
September skyjackers. But records and interviews show that FBI agents
have been interested for more than a year in Soubra's attendance at
Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz., as well as
his membership in Al Muhajiroun, a hard-line anti-American group
based in London that some intelligence agents suspect of links to
Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   It was partly the concern about Al Muhajiroun and Soubra's
connections to flight schools that prompted Williams' memo.</TE>
<TE>   Soubra has acknowledged causing controversy in Arizona. He
organized a street demonstration protesting Russia's war in Chechnya;
arranged a critical discussion of the U.S.' presence in Yemen, and
was asked to leave a local mosque after scolding members for
accepting the authority of the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   But in an interview last fall with The Times, Soubra condemned the
Sept. 11 attacks as a violation of Islamic law because they targeted
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the government is doing everything it can to keep this
guy locked up," said Soubra's attorney, Eric Bjotvedt. "Yet they are
not charging him as a terrorist. They are only saying he fell out of
status."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bjotvedt: "He feels he has been wrongly detained and become a
scapegoat, all because he fit some profile."</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the INS did not return calls for comment about the
ruling.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- With higher postage rates set to take effect in two
weeks, the Postal Service on Wednesday urged Americans to plan ahead
and buy stamps now.</LD>
<LD>   New rates boosting first-class mail by 3 cents to 37 cents take
effect June 30.</LD>
<LD>   The post office says billions of 37-cent stamps have been shipped
to its offices across the country.</LD>
<TE>   Five different nondenominated stamps good for the 37-cent rate
went on sale June 7. They are a U.S. flag stamp and a set of four
antique toy stamps, depicting a mail wagon, steam locomotive, taxicab
and fire engine.</TE>
<TE>   The agency also has a 3-cent "makeup rate" stamp featuring a star
highlighted in red, white and blue. The stamps also can be purchased
online at www.usps.comshop or by calling toll free (800) STAMP-24.</TE>
<TE>   Also issued June 7 were the 23-cent Carlsbad Caverns National Park
stamped postal card and a 37-cent stamped envelope with a red, white
and blue ribbon star in the center.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The nation's top immigration official said Wednesday he
is willing to consider the economic impact on the travel industry of
an administration proposal to limit how long foreigners can visit the
United States.</LD>
<LD>   James W. Ziglar, commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, agreed in a House committee hearing to meet
with industry members to address their concerns, as long as Bush
administration officials approve and the law allows it.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration wants to eliminate the automatic six-month
stay currently granted to international tourists. Instead, it wants
inspectors to grant tourists only as much time as needed to complete
their trip, up to six months.</LD>
<TE>   Since the attacks, the INS has sought ways to better track foreign
visitors. Fifteen of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers entered the United
States legally on travel visas. Three were admitted with business
visas and the 19th entered on a student visa. Ziglar said most of the
hijackers still were legally in the country when the attacks
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would not only help the nation fight terrorism, but
also would cut down on people overstaying their visas, Ziglar said.
He said the rule would make it more difficult for people to stay
undetected in the United States for long periods of time.</TE>
<TE>   "Individuals who seek to do harm to our country are more likely to
expose themselves if they fail to play by the rules," Ziglar said.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents of the proposal, including the president's brother,
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, said the proposal will hurt the tourism
businesses. Bush said the proposal could affect his state's tourism,
which benefited from more than $5.5 billion in spending by foreign
visitors last year.</TE>

<HD>Police Arrest Four on Freeway After Brea Bank Robbery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four men were arrested Wednesday morning after a bank robbery in a
Brea shopping complex.</LD>
<LD>   Two men wearing nylon masks came into Quaker City Bank in the 200
block of State College Boulevard at 10:38 a.m. and demanded money
from two tellers, police said. The robbers jumped onto the counter,
struck a male teller and forced a female teller to the floor, Lt.
Martin Needham said.</LD>
<LD>   The robbers displayed no weapons, and no one was seriously
injured, he said. Officials did not disclose how much was stolen.</LD>
<TE>   An undercover police officer spotted the two driving a 1990 Honda
in a nearby parking lot, where they met two other men. The four left
together in a 1997 white Ford Thunderbird, leaving the Honda behind,
Needham said.</TE>
<TE>   The officer followed the car south on the Orange Freeway, he said.
Several police vehicles, as well as a helicopter, joined the pursuit,
following for about four miles before stopping the car near the
interchange to the Riverside Freeway, Needham said. The four men were
arrested. The car had been reported stolen.</TE>
<TE>   Booked on suspicion of bank robbery were Jamal Thompson, 24, of
Hawthorne; and Damon Lee Roberson, 29; Darnell Alexander, 22; and
Marco Davis, 19, all from Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Smoking Goes From Bad to Worse, New Research Finds</HD>
<DH>Health: It's a deadlier carcinogen and causes more types of
the disease than scientists believed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tobacco smoke is a much deadlier carcinogen and triggers a broader
variety of cancers than researchers had previously believed,
according to the most comprehensive study of smoking ever undertaken.</LD>
<LD>   The new study also provides the first definitive evidence that
secondhand smoke causes lung cancer, increasing the risk to those
people exposed by about 20%. The new study firmly links smoking to
stomach, liver, cervical and kidney cancer, as well as to myeloid
leukemia. Such links were suspected, but not proved.</LD>
<LD>   "We are still learning just how damaging cigarette smoking is,"
Dr. Jonathan Samet of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health told
a London news conference Wednesday. "Only now are we beginning to see
the full picture of what happens when a generation begins to smoke at
an early age ... the full picture is more disturbing than what we saw
when we only had the smaller pieces."</LD>
<TE>   Samet chaired an international panel of 29 experts convened by the
United Nations' International Agency for Research on Cancer to
conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of smoking research since
1986. The team examined more than 3,000 studies involving millions of
smokers. Their report will be published later this year, but parts of
it are scheduled to be posted on the agency's Web
site--www.iarc.fr--today.</TE>
<TE>   "When we put all that information together, the picture becomes
much clearer," said Dr. Patricia A. Buffler of UC Berkeley, a member
of the research group. "This confirms many things that people were
concerned about."</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 1.2 billion people worldwide smoke, and their
prognosis is grim, according to the study. At least half of them will
be killed prematurely by smoking-related diseases, including cancer,
heart disease and emphysema. Half of those deaths will occur in
middle age, with an average loss of 20 to 25 years of life
expectancy.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to finding new links, researchers concluded that the
risks for some tumors previously linked to smoking was higher than
suspected.</TE>
<TE>   For tumors of the bladder and kidney, for example, researchers had
previously thought smokers had three to four times the normal risk.
The new data indicate the actual risk is five to six times normal,
IARC director Dr. Paul Kleihuis said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the cancers are associated with other factors as well.
Cervical cancer is associated with the human papilloma virus, stomach
cancer with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, and liver cancer with
hepatitis viruses. But in each of those cases, Buffler said, smoking
doubles the risk.</TE>
<TE>   The study, which Buffler said was the most comprehensive ever
undertaken, found no evidence, however, that smoking increases the
risk of prostate, breast or endometrial cancers. That is probably
because these tumors are triggered primarily by hormones rather than
by exposure to chemicals in the environment, said Sir Richard Doll of
Oxford University, a member of the panel.</TE>
<TE>   The team also looked at more than 50 studies focused on exposure
to secondhand smoke and concluded that such exposure is linked to
lung cancer, but no others. "It is a very strong association,"
Buffler said. There are more than 4,000 chemicals in cigarette smoke
and new studies have shown that they can be measured in the body
fluids and urine of nonsmokers.</TE>
<TE>   "It is now well established that they are being breathed in by
nonsmokers, absorbed, and are having an impact on genetic material,"
Buffler said.</TE>
<TE>   Some national agencies, including the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and the National Cancer Institute, had concluded
that secondhand smoke causes cancer, but this is the first time an
international group like the U.N. has reached the same conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   The study also pointed to some disturbing trends, such as the
marked increase in the number of women smoking and the growing
incidence of smoking in developing countries.</TE>

<HD>People May Interfere With Whales' Songs</HD>
<DH>Science: Researchers find that the animals may become
confused by sound pollution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY SINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Researchers have identified the source of a deep rumbling in the
ocean as the song of the male fin whale, raising concerns that its
mating calls are being disrupted by sound pollution from sonar and
commercial shipping.</LD>
<LD>   The whales sing in a very low frequency that can travel long
distances across the ocean. Because man-made sounds, like sonar,
occur in a similar range, scientists speculate that the whales' "love
songs" are being drowned out, according to a new study of fin whales
published today in the journal Nature.</LD>
<LD>   Christopher Clark, director of the bioacoustics research program
at Cornell University and co-author of the study, said whales once
could talk to neighbors 100 miles away, but now might only find
friends and mates within five to 10 miles. For a fin whale in a noisy
part of the ocean, its "world would suddenly get smaller," Clark
said, adding that the animals' shrinking sphere of communications
could limit their breeding encounters.</LD>
<TE>   Designated an endangered species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, fin whales are dispersed over the world's oceans. Their
present population is estimated to be about 40,000 in the Northern
Hemisphere and up to 15,000 to 20,000 in the Southern Hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   Because the whales are so spread out, scientists were unable to
pinpoint them as the source of the booming ocean songs. Using a
technique that is similar to one the U.S. Navy uses to track
submarines, researchers were able to attribute the song, one of the
loudest in the sea.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists used an array of 16 underwater microphones to pinpoint
the source of the sounds, which they matched to locations of the
whales. The acoustic tracking technique "is like being in a crowded
room with your eyes closed," Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists also had to get close enough to the whales to collect a
sample of skin cells, which they then tested to determine the sex of
the animal.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the sometimes high-pitched songs of the humpback whale, fin
whale songs are in a low frequency range that is undetectable to the
human ear.</TE>
<TE>   Clark said whales from the same area sing the same song,
which lasts 10 to 15 minutes and has a very stylized structure. More
distant whales have a different "dialect," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The direct impact of the man-made noise pollution on whale
breeding is still uncertain. There is evidence that some sonar sounds
can deafen or daze whales.</TE>
<TE>   "One hundred years ago, the ocean was 100 times quieter," Clark
said. "Some of these animals can live that long and remember when the
ocean was a much quieter place."</TE>

<LD>With so many baseball uniforms turning into a standard mix of gray
and blue it's getting tougher to tell teams apart.</LD>
<LD>   And when Shawn Green and Carlos Delgado stand next to each other,
you could dress one in a hockey sweater and they'd still look like
teammates.</LD>
<LD>   There they were, next to the batting cage at Dodger Stadium. The
rest of the Dodgers were practicing, all the other Blue Jays were
stretching down the first-base line.</LD>
<TE>   One trade, 2,100 miles, an international border and separate
leagues haven't been enough to drive Green and Delgado apart. This
week's interleague games between the Dodgers and Toronto Blue Jays
just happened to bring them together on the same field again.</TE>
<TE>   "When you play on different teams, you still are pulling for your
friends," Green said. "When you play against him--even here--I'm
pulling for him to do well. I want to win the games, and that's it."</TE>
<TE>   Green is from Tustin, Delgado from the town of Aguadilla in
northwest Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got, I wouldn't say similar backgrounds, but the way we
were brought up," Delgado said. "I come from a good family, he comes
from a good family.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very family-oriented. It's one of those things that's hard
to explain. We hit it off. Year in and year out you seem to be at the
same place at the same time and you get to know each other pretty
good."</TE>
<TE>   Their friendship was forged on the way through the Toronto
organization, with stops in Dunedin, Fla., Knoxville, Tenn., and
Syracuse, N.Y. It didn't end when Green was traded to the Dodgers for
Raul Mondesi in November 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "They were tight," Blue Jay catcher Darrin Fletcher said. "They
came up together in the minor leagues, they were a big part of the
club too. They were kind of our dynamic duo. They did a lot together.
They were both single at the time and had plenty of time on their
hands to hang out. They're still close, even today."</TE>
<TE>   They talk at least once a week. Green is married now; Delgado was
in the wedding.</TE>
<TE>   They both played in Class A in 1992. The next year they were in
double A, then they moved up to triple A in '94.</TE>
<TE>   Green hit the majors full-time in 1995, and Delgado came up for
good in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "We were together for eight years," Green said. "We have, I think,
in some ways real similar personalities, in other ways real
different. He's a lot more assertive. I'm kind of a more passive
person. I think that kind of mixes well. We always got along. He
laughs at my dumb jokes. We have fun.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, he's always been kind of like a big brother. He's taught
me a lot about hitting and just about handling myself in different
situations. That's the kind of thing that always came real easy for
him."</TE>
<TE>   Analyzing pitchers also came easier for Delgado than Green.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a better memory than him," Delgado said.</TE>
<TE>   They went over pitchers and their patterns from at-bat to at-bat
and game to game.</TE>
<TE>   "The next time I'd see the same guy I'd say, 'Well, this guy did
this last time,' " Delgado said. "It got to the point where I had to
remember for both of us.</TE>
<TE>   "But he was pretty good. Next thing you know, the more times you
face guys, you pick up a few things here and there. It gives you a
little bit of an advantage."</TE>
<TE>   They challenged each other, including a friendly home run
competition in batting practice in which the loser bought sushi.</TE>
<TE>   For some time it appeared that Green needed Delgado. As Green
said: "He's helped me build my confidence. He always believed in me
and what I can do, and that kind of rubbed off."</TE>
<TE>   In Green's first year in Los Angeles he hit a career-low .269 and
his power production dropped from 42 home runs and 123 RBIs in 1999
to 24 homers and 99 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it was the adjustment to the National League and the return
to Southern California. The Dodgers promoted Green and he was
outspoken about his desire to be a role model for the Jewish
community. Maybe it was all too much.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it was tough to learn how to say no to people and how to
be assertive," Green said. "The one difficult thing was learning how
to separate being at home and playing at home. Toronto was kind of
like my baseball world, where my home is my home, and all of a sudden
everything is combined. That was difficult to adjust to. Now I'm used
to it."</TE>
<TE>   If he finally learned how to handle stardom, then he had to come
to grips with how to deal with standing alone in the batting order.
With Gary Sheffield batting behind him last year, he saw enough good
pitches to hit a Dodger-record 49 home runs and drive in 125 runs.</TE>
<TE>   But after Sheffield was traded to Atlanta in the off-season, Green
got off to a slow start.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of April, he was hitting .237 with only three home runs
and 17 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   He was sitting on a .230 average and had not homered in a month
May 21 when he hit two out against Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   His 18 homers since that date (including four in one game on May
23) are the most in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, he is fine just by himself now. Can he imagine himself
reunited with Delgado?</TE>
<TE>   "The odds are probably slim, but it would be nice to play together
again," Green said. "You never know, though."</TE>
<TE>   With Eric Karros returning to form and an already bloated payroll,
it wouldn't be easy for the Dodgers to bring Delgado in to play first
base.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, on the other hand, would be a great destination for
Delgado and his big, left-handed bat.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Blue Jays are struggling in the American League East,
they haven't started an auction yet.</TE>
<TE>   If they do decide to bail out, with two years and $36 million left
on Delgado's contract, not to mention his trade value, he would be a
logical place to start.</TE>
<TE>   Talkative on every other subject, Delgado won't talk about this
topic, including whether or not he would waive his no-trade clause to
go to the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not here to speculate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   We'd like to see him play.</TE>
<TE>   He sure could help the Angels, and you've got to think that if he
and Green were both in Southern California, Green would be better off
too.</TE>

<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Memo to Phil Anschutz: Run and grab your checkbook, there's a
financial coup to be made out of Italy's miserable exit from the
World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   Make the check out to an unhappy, misguided and apparently
vindictive man named Luciano Gaucci. You can find him at Perugia, the
Serie A club that has been linked to U.S. World Cup and former Galaxy
striker Clint Mathis.</LD>
<LD>   Gaucci is the team's president, and he has just made a blunder
that will haunt him for a long, long time.</LD>
<TE>   Overreacting to Italy's 2-1 overtime loss to South Korea on
Tuesday night, he has fired South Korean hero Ahn Jung-Hwan, who
scored the winning goal that put his country in the quarterfinals and
sent Italy home.</TE>
<TE>   Worse yet, Gaucci has voiced some ugly comments that smack of
racism.</TE>
<TE>   According to Agence France-Presse, Gaucci told the private Italian
radio station La 7 that he would not renew Ahn's contract with
Perugia. Fair enough, that's his option. But listen to his reasons:</TE>
<TE>   "I am not extending his contract, he does not merit it," Gaucci
said. "When he arrived he was like a little lost goat who didn't even
have the money to buy a sandwich. He became rich without doing
anything exceptional and then, at the World Cup, he denigrated
Italian football.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have to pay three billion lire [$1.53 million] to extend
his contract. But I won't. Ahn will never play for Perugia again.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you think I would do? That I would keep a player who
ruined Italian football? He should have shown his talents when he was
with us. He'll just have to go back to Korea and earn 100,000 lire
[about $48] a month."</TE>
<TE>   No he won't. Ahn, 26, the first Korean to play in Serie A, would
be a huge hit if he joined the Galaxy. He could help it on the field
and, even more important, in the stands. South Korea's success in the
World Cup has galvanized Los Angeles' burgeoning Korean population.</TE>
<TE>   These are fans who have been largely indifferent to the Galaxy but
who would become faithful followers were Ahn wearing Los Angeles
colors. It's a perfect fit. All it will take is a check.</TE>
<TE>   It might be that you will have to contact Ahn's original K-League
club, the Busan I-cons, but certainly the folks there would be happy
to see Ahn leave Perugia and the bitter Gaucci behind and join a club
like the Galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   And while you're at it, Phil, drop a note to Mathis. Tell him you
will not be willing to trade him from the New York/New Jersey
Metro-Stars to Perugia. If he wants to go elsewhere, fine, but the
Italian club is no place for up-and-coming players with talent.</TE>
<TE>   Not while it has a president as bitter and sour as Gaucci.</TE>

<HD>Pitching Is Starting Point for Angel Skid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Strong starting pitching fueled the Angels' post-April ascent,
helping the then-struggling club make a surprising turnaround.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels believe the rotation hasn't reached its zenith, though
another member stalled Wednesday night as they dropped their fourth
in a row, 6-2, to the St. Louis Cardinals in an interleague game at
Busch Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   A somber crowd of 35,432 mourned the death of Jack Buck, the
Cardinals' Hall of Fame broadcaster, during a pre-game, on-field
ceremony, and St. Louis trailed in the first inning after David
Eckstein's leadoff double and Garret Anderson's run-scoring single.</LD>
<TE>   Things turned quickly for the Angels, and a starter was at the
center of the trouble again.</TE>
<TE>   This time it was Aaron Sele (6-4), who was ineffective in 5 1/3
innings on a night the Angels needed a solid outing after Kevin
Appier worked only two-plus innings Tuesday. Sele gave up eight
hits--including three home runs--and six runs as the Angels matched
their second-longest skid of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels (39-29) are three games behind the first-place Seattle
Mariners in the American League West, and only one game ahead of the
charging Oakland Athletics.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said it doesn't take a genius to
figure out what's going wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "You can point your finger at what's happened to us: We're not
getting the consistent starts that we had been for six weeks," said
Scioscia, whose starters are 0-3 with a 15.34 earned-run average in
their last four outings.</TE>
<TE>   "Every team is going to go through this. Where we had one good
start after another, and the guys were all just feeding off of that,
right now we're trying to break the cycle of tough start after tough
start.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, if you look at what's happening in the last week, it
really has come down to our starting pitching hasn't gone deep
enough, and pitched effectively enough, to give us an opportunity to
win ballgames. This last week has been tough, but there's nobody
losing confidence in this club.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nobody that doesn't feel this club is a
championship-caliber club, and we'll eventually get there."</TE>
<TE>   Placido Polanco had a big night, providing the Cardinals with an
unexpected source of power.</TE>
<TE>   The diminutive utilityman (listed at 5 feet 10, 168 pounds) had
his first career two-home run game, equaling a career high with four
runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco, who entered the game with one homer, gave the Cardinals a
6-1 lead with a three-run blast to left field in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Morris (10-4) knew what to do with the support.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinal ace went right at the Angels, taking command over
seven strong innings for the National League Central Division's
first-place club, which has won five straight to improve to 40-29 and
goes for a three-game sweep today. Morris gave up seven hits and two
runs, displaying the type of performance the Angels now need from one
of their veteran starters.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Spiezio played well in place of All-Star third baseman Troy
Glaus--benched because of a 12-for-90 slump--going three for four
with his fourth home run.</TE>
<TE>   He needed a triple for the cycle and played well on defense.</TE>
<TE>   However, offense isn't the Angels' pressing concern.</TE>
<TE>   "Starters set the tone," said Sele, who has given up 15 hits and
10 earned runs in his last 11 1/3 innings. "Obviously, a game like
today, you try to keep it close for as long as you can while you're
out there.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look over at what Matt did tonight, he held us down. He
just kept pitching his game. That's what you need to do as a starting
pitcher, and I didn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   The solution for the Angels is simple, albeit difficult to
achieve, pitching coach Bud Black said.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a starter to step up and pitch a good game," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "A good game is a shutout, one run or two runs, and to pitch deep
into the game. That's what we need."</TE>

<HD>Team Pursuing Alfonseca</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>The Angels, seeking bullpen help, are pursuing a deal to acquire
Chicago Cub closer Antonio Alfonseca, a baseball source said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The recent shaky performance of setup man Al Levine has prompted
General Manager Bill Stoneman to discuss trade proposals with many
clubs, hoping to bolster that area before the July 31 non-waiver
trading deadline.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Angels are considering several relievers, Alfonseca's
name has emerged atop their list because they believe he could best
fill the role in front of All-Star closer Troy Percival, and the
struggling Cubs are willing to move him to cut payroll. Alfonseca is
owed the remainder of his $3.55-million salary and can become a free
agent after the season.</LD>
<TE>   The 6-foot-5, 250-pound right-hander--acquired May 27 from the
Florida Marlins in a six-player deal--is 1-1 with 10 saves and a 2.25
earned-run average in 28 games.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonseca, who has 24 strikeouts in 32 innings, has limited
opponents to a .220 batting average--.169 against right-handed
batters. He was 4-4 with a 3.06 ERA and 28 saves last season, and led
the major leagues with 45 saves in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia played 15 seasons in the majors, so he knows
the benefit of an occasional day off.</TE>
<TE>   After watching Troy Glaus struggle for about a month, Scioscia
decided to give him a break, benching the All-Star third baseman in
the St. Louis Cardinals' 6-2 victory at Busch Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "Troy's been pressing a little bit; we want him to take a step
back," Scioscia said. "Hopefully, he'll be able to relax a little
bit, and he'll get right back out there [today]."</TE>
<TE>   Glaus missed his fourth game of the season, and first because of
performance reasons, having sat out twice while serving a suspension
for fighting in spring training and once because of a problem with
his contact lenses.</TE>
<TE>   His current problem is a 12-for-90 slump. After batting .306 in
April and .280 in May, Glaus is hitting .119 (seven for 59) in 16
games this month.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus' average has dropped to .246. He leads the club with 52 runs
batted in and is second with 13 home runs.</TE>
<TE>   "There are probably eight, nine, 10 balls that he's hit right on
the screws, but he doesn't have much to show for it," Scioscia said.
"We've got a long stretch of games left here [on an 11-day, 11-game
trip]. In Texas, we've got five games in four days, so there's a lot
of baseball to be played."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

report to Class-A Rancho Cucamonga this week.</TE>

<HD>He's Ready for Round 2</HD>
<DH>Boxing: With distractions few and far between, Morales
keeps his mind on Saturday's rematch with Barrera.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>There were days, Erik Morales acknowledges with a sly grin, that he
grew weary of training at the solitary Mexican mountaintop Otomi
complex, a bare-bones, back-to-the-roots operation that has served as
his camp for nearly five years.</LD>
<LD>   And really, who could blame him?</LD>
<LD>   The mind-numbing roadwork through the woods would wear him down.
His thoughts would begin to drift as he pounded out too-many-to-count
push-ups and sit-ups. The hours of hitting speed bags and focus pads
would take their toll.</LD>
<TE>   Oh sure, the spartan El Centro Ceremonial Otomi, about a
three-hour drive from Mexico City, afforded Morales a chance to
concentrate on the task at hand--preparing for his fight Saturday
night at the MGM Grand Garden Arena against hated rival Marco Antonio
Barrera--and not worry about distractions. Especially because there's
no electricity or telephones on the land that once was sacred ground
to the Aztecs but for decades has served as a training center for
elite Mexican athletes.</TE>
<TE>   But isn't there a saying about all work and no play making Juanito
a dull boy?</TE>
<TE>   Morales needed a respite, lest he burn himself out preparing for
the rematch of 2000's fight of the year.</TE>
<TE>   So when the mood would strike him, he'd break camp by jumping into
a car, snake down the winding mountain road for about 45 minutes and
pull into the nearest village that had the requisite electricity and
accompanying phone line. His hands often still wrapped in tape,
Morales would break out his ever-present laptop computer, log on to
the Internet and surf cyberspace for hours on end, updating the
boxing Web site he oversees while shooting off e-mails to check in
with the musical act he recently signed.</TE>
<TE>   The reigning World Boxing Council featherweight champion, who
seemingly entered the world with one strike against him when he was
born in a room above a sweaty gym in Tijuana's red-light district, is
more than meets the eye.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, he uses his hard-knock life experience of growing up in one
of Tijuana's seedier neighborhoods as an excuse for cursing like a
sailor--he used offensive language to question Barrera's sexuality
while horrifying the more well-heeled of Mexican society. But Morales
as the Mexican Mike Tyson? Hardly.</TE>
<TE>   The darker-skinned Morales, who was once called a "dumb Indian" by
the more pale and Mexico City-raised Barrera, has a polished
corporate side to him as well as being La Zona Norte's favorite son.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been through a lot of bad things in my life but the key is
not allowing them to get me down," said Morales, a high school
dropout who went to trade school to learn how to repair refrigerators
and is now a married father of three. "You can't let negative things
affect you and by being involved with positive people and positive
things like music, it only makes you a better person."</TE>
<TE>   It's no surprise then that the person Morales became was a boxer.</TE>
<TE>   The gym he was born above belonged to his father. And with Jose
Morales a flyweight contender in the 1970s, the line between home and
work became blurred, so a career using his fists was inevitable. Jose
is now his son's manager and shares training duties with Fernando
Fernandez and Al Stankie after Floyd Mayweather Sr. was released
early in camp.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Morales began boxing when he was 5, eventually won 11
amateur titles and earned the nickname of El Terrible for his
devastating knockout power and the ferocious manner in which he
dispatched his opponents.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing more fierce than his punch was his pride in being
from Mexico's border region. Morales, 25, has Frontera (Border)
stitched into the waistband of his boxing trunks and, when he's
training in a gym where there's electricity, he'll pump up the stereo
to feel the beat of the banda/ranchera musical artist he promotes,
Nicko Flores.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about respect," Morales said, "earning it and keeping it."</TE>
<TE>   But while he won his first major title as a super bantamweight
with an 11th-round technical knockout of Daniel Zaragoza on Sept. 6,
1997, and is 41-0 with 31 knockouts, including victories over seven
world champions, Morales has been dogged of late.</TE>
<TE>   Whispers that he has not been the same since eking out a hotly
contested split decision against Barrera on Feb. 19, 2000 have
haunted Morales.</TE>
<TE>   In his two most recent fights--against Guty Espadas for his WBC
126-pound title on Feb. 17, 2001 and versus Injin Chi last July
28--Morales looked sluggish and was taken the distance by both
fighters. Though Morales won both fights by unanimous decision, many
questioned his efforts in the ring as well as the judges' scorecards.</TE>
<TE>   "I fought two tough guys and I took a lot of punishment, that's
all," he said. "I thought I handled them well."</TE>
<TE>   The media on both sides of the border have hinted that he has been
given "gift wins" as the "can't-miss prospect" fighting under the
powerful Top Rank banner.</TE>
<TE>   And while Top Rank President Bob Arum dismisses such talk, he
acknowledges that a content Morales let his weight balloon to 160
pounds before the Espadas fight.</TE>
<TE>   There has been no such satisfaction this time, however, as Morales
said Monday he was within two pounds of making 126 by Friday's
weigh-in.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if Morales fights the way he should fight and not the way
Barrera wants him to fight," Arum said, "that Morales will end up
knocking out Barrera the same way [Lennox] Lewis knocked out [Mike]
Tyson" in the heavyweight title fight June 8.</TE>

Brazil  vs. England
Tonight, 11:30 PDT, at Shizuoka, Japan
TV: ESPN, Ch. 34. Delayed: Ch. 46, noon
How they got here: Brazil finished first in Group B and defeated
Belgium, 2-0, in the second round. England, second in Group F, scored
three times in the first half to defeat Denmark, 3-0, in the second
round
Brazil update: If you prefer the shorthand, here is the essence of
the team Brazil has sent to the 2002 quarterfinals: Three Rs and no
D. The attacking talents of Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho have
compensated for a very suspect defense. Ronaldo has scored in all
four of Brazil's games and shares the tournament lead for most
goals--five--with Germany's Miroslav Klose. Ronaldo has nine World
Cup goals in 11 matches, second in Brazilian history to Pele's 12
England update: England has not given up a goal since its opening 1-1
tie with Sweden. England has yet to lose when Rio Ferdinand and Sol
Campbell have been paired in the central defense, as they have every
game in Japan. In those 14 games, England is 9-0-5, giving up only
nine goals and more than one in a game once. Forward Michael Owen and
midfielder Paul Scholes sat out practice Tuesday while resting groin
and ankle injuries, respectively, but are both expected to play
Outlook: Brazil and England haven't met in a World Cup since 1970,
the year Pele won his final championship. At a stage of the
tournament where defense usually provides the difference, England
could have its revenge at last</TE>

<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>In England, they still talk about The Save as if it happened
yesterday. Sad truth is, it has been 32 years since Gordon Banks went
from one post to the other to deny Pele's header, in an eventual 1-0
loss to Brazil, in Mexico, in 1970, and it's really about time the
English moved on and talked about something else they did right
against Brazil in a World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   New fodder could be coming Friday in Shizuoka, Japan.</LD>
<LD>   There, England and Brazil will meet in a World Cup match for the
first time since 1970 in the one 2002 quarterfinal that actually
seems like a World Cup quarterfinal. No out-of-nowhere interloper
crashed this bracket. It's the country that invented soccer against
the country that elevated the game to perhaps its highest levels.</LD>
<TE>   Not unexpectedly, both camps are amped.</TE>
<TE>   "My cash is on Brazil to win the tournament, but now I honestly
believe England will beat them," Manchester United Coach Alex
Ferguson said to the English tabloid The Sun.</TE>
<TE>   The Brazilians, meanwhile, make offhand references to the World
Cup championship standings--Brazil 4, England 1--and seem amused by
the media furor about English players David Beckham and Michael Owen.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not concerned about players such as David Beckham and Michael
Owen, as there are better players in our squad," Ronaldinho said.</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeeper Marcos agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "We know about Beckham and that he has a good right foot," he
said. "But we have players who are better."</TE>
<TE>   In a World Cup where tradition has been shredded, this match
offers two old-guard teams that have arrived in the quarterfinals
with their reputations reasonably intact.</TE>
<TE>   With Ronaldo fit again and Rivaldo pressing him for the tournament
scoring lead, Brazil has shown it can still play the beautiful soccer
for which is it renowned. England, meanwhile, has been typically
resilient in resolve and dogged in defense--recording three
consecutive shutouts, including a 3-0 rout of Denmark in the second
round.</TE>
<TE>   This is the kind of matchup the World Cup used to be about.
Nothing against South Korea, Senegal and Turkey, but this one, at
last, is something for the purists.</TE>

<LD>Woody Paige of the Denver Post commenting on Tiger Woods winning the
U.S. Open: "What don't you already know about Tiger? He killed a bear
when he was only 3. Or maybe he shot a 63 when he was only 3.</LD>
<LD>   "He came to earth from another galaxy. He changed his name from
Apollo, the sun god.</LD>
<LD>   "He can play Mozart's 'Symphony No. 40 in G Minor' with a 5-iron
and a comb."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Woods: Bernie Lincicome in the Rocky Mountain News: "If
[Woods] wins in Scotland [British Open], the PGA Championship in
August in Chaska, Minn., will be a combination of the running of the
bulls in Pamplona, the Pillsbury Bake-Off, and a reunion of The
Beatles, and I'm talking about all four of them."</TE>

<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the record for most minutes played in an
NBA Finals game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A case for Bonds: Gary Shelton of the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times,
commenting that Barry Bonds deserves to be ranked with the game's
all-time great hitters:</TE>
<TE>   "The magic of Bonds is that he cannot only take you deep, he can
take you back. Watching him approach the plate--watching has always
been the easy part with Bonds--and you find yourself wondering if
anyone has been more frightening for a pitcher, if anyone has been
more dominant with a bat in his hands.</TE>
<TE>   "Mays? DiMaggio? Cobb?</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nervous time: Steve Hummer in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on
Sergio Garcia's performance in the U.S. Open:</TE>
<TE>   "Setting up for a shot, he looks like a man trying to play a
trumpet solo on a live snake."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Garcia: Comedy writer Alex Kaseberg in the San Francisco
Chronicle:</TE>
<TE>   "[Garcia] was in the middle of his waggle Sunday and didn't even
notice the 49-minute rain delay."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Select class: Bill Walton commenting on Shaquille O'Neal:</TE>
<TE>   "There's really no challengers but that's not Shaq's fault.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been saying for the last five years that Shaq is one of the
five best centers in history."</TE>
<TE>   The others, according to Walton, are Wilt Chamberlain, Bill
Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Hakeem Olajuwon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yawn: Norman Chad on America Online:</TE>
<TE>   "The World Cup matches remind me of watching Arizona Cardinal-New
York Giant contests. Most of the game is played around midfield and
nobody scores until Jake Plummer throws an interception."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No big deal: "How anticlimactic was the Lakers' victory?" asks Jim
Armstrong of the Denver Post. "There were more rioters on the streets
of L.A. after the Oscars ceremony."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Kevin Johnson of the Phoenix Suns, 62 minutes
against Chicago on June 13, 1993, three overtimes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Tony Kornheiser in the Washington Post:</TE>
<TE>   "Some folks may complain about World Cup soccer being on TV so
early because of the 13-hour time difference in Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "Not me. I'm always up at 5 a.m. because Lenny Shapiro's dog won't
shut up."</TE>

<LD>   What: "Beyond the Glory"</LD>
<LD>   Where: Fox Sports Net, Sunday, 8 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   The Chipper Jones story, as told in the next episode of "Beyond
the Glory," is more interesting than one might think. It's a story of
how a self-absorbed superstar matures and becomes a concerned family
man.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, drafted by the Atlanta Braves as a shortstop, was the No. 1
overall pick in 1990. He was the National League's most valuable
player in 1999 and is a five-time All-Star.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' baseball prowess is well-covered. But what is more
interesting is how Jones has handled a sometimes troubled personal
life. He became a tarnished golden boy when an extramarital affair
led to the birth of a son out of wedlock in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, divorced from his first wife in 1999, has since remarried
and had a second son. But he has taken responsibility for his first
son and sees him regularly.</TE>
<TE>   He says of his former lifestyle: "I was cocky and arrogant and
living the good life in the big leagues....There were many a times
when I needed to be knocked down a peg."</TE>
<TE>   It was a tough two-hour phone call with his mother that influenced
Jones to change his ways.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never said things like that to anyone else," Lynne Jones
says.</TE>
<TE>   "I was extremely disappointed in his moral character and I told
him that I was. I thought he had more respect for women than that. I
thought I'd taught him more respect for women than that."</TE>

Clemson.</LD>
<LD>   Landon Powell and Steve Thomas added solo homers for the Gamecocks

the winner advancing to Saturday's championship game.</LD>

innings and struck out a career-high eight.</LD>
<TE>   The Gamecocks outhit the Tigers, 15-9, and Clemson (54-16) left 12
men on, leaving the bases loaded three times. If Clemson had won, it
would have ended South Carolina's season.</TE>
<TE>   The intensity of the state rivalry was clear before the first
inning was over. Both benches received warnings after pitches sailed
over the heads of Clemson's Khalil Greene and South Carolina leadoff
batter Drew Meyer.</TE>

<HD>Media Outlets Claim FIFA, Referee Cheated</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Thieves" and "Shame!" screamed newspaper headlines Wednesday as much
of the Italian media blamed soccer's ruling body FIFA and "killer
refereeing" for the national team's elimination from the World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   FIFA used Ecuadorean referee Byron Moreno to fix the Azzurri's 2-1
defeat against South Korea on Tuesday, some of the country's top
soccer commentators suggested.</LD>
<LD>   "Thieves--the killer referee hounds the Azzurri out of the World
Cup," the Rome daily Corriere dello Sport said in its front page.</LD>
<TE>   "Shame! The scandalous Ecuadorean referee--Italy is out of the
World Cup," said the country's top-selling sports daily, La Gazzetta
dello Sport.</TE>
<TE>   Even the usually moderate Corriere della Sera, the country's most
respected newspaper, described the World Cup as "dirty" in its
front-page headline and editorial.</TE>
<TE>   "Italy has been thrown out of a dirty World Cup, where referees
and linesmen are used as hitmen," leading soccer commentator Giorgio
Tosatti wrote in Corriere della Sera.</TE>
<TE>   "Italy doesn't count anymore in those circles where results are
decided and billionaire deals are struck," said an editorial in La
Gazzetta dello Sport, which also listed other dubious decisions in
Italy's previous World Cup games.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A national holiday if England gets to the World Cup final? Let's
first get past Brazil in the quarterfinals and then we'll see, says
Prime Minister Tony Blair.</LD>
<LD>   Former sports minister Tony Banks urged Blair on Wednesday to
delare a public holiday on Monday, July 1, the day after the World
Cup final, if England gets that far.</LD>
<LD>   Banks, a Labor Party parliamentarian, said it would allow fans to
celebrate or drown their sorrows without having to worry about
getting up for work.</LD>
<TE>   Blair treated Banks' request with caution during prime minister's
question time in the House of Commons.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to thank you for your very interesting submission,
which I will consider carefully," he said. "Let us just get over the
hurdle of beating Brazil on Friday, all right?"</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Buckingham Palace announced that Prince Andrew was
flying to Japan to support England in its clash with Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   The prince, who is president of England's Football Assn., was not
originally scheduled to be at the match.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to be there because England are doing so well," a
Buckingham Palace spokesman said, on customary condition of
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew will travel on a scheduled flight to Tokyo today.</TE>

<HD>11th Win Easier for Ishii</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: He goes a strong 62/3 innings and even knocks in
two in 5-2 victory over Blue Jays. Green hits 21st homer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Never mind the fretting over the mysteries of Kazuhisa Ishii's ups
and downs.</LD>
<LD>   For one night at least, the Dodger left-hander kept Manager Jim
Tracy easy in his seat.</LD>
<LD>   Blessed with a five-run lead after the first inning Wednesday,
Ishii followed up his ugly last start with 6 2/3 smooth innings in a
5-2 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays in front of 31,429 at Dodger
Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   After 14 major league starts, Ishii's record is a stunning 11-2.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't all come easily, not with him pitching in and out of
jams all the time.</TE>
<TE>   This one did.</TE>
<TE>   "I think things went a little smoother," Ishii said through an
interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   On a night when his wife, Ayako Kisa, and their 6-month-old child
Kanta attended their first Dodger game, Ishii gave up two runs and
four hits while striking out nine and walking four. (The nine
strikeouts were his most since he struck out 10 in his Dodger debut.)</TE>
<TE>   And while Shawn Green chalked up another home run--his 21st--along
with three more RBIs--giving him 56--Green drove in only one more run
than Ishii, who collected his first two major league RBIs with a
bases-loaded single to left in the first inning.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you a good hitter?" someone asked.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii needed no interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   "So-so," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The game ended with Eric Gagne picking up his major league-leading
24th save by retiring the side in order in the ninth, and the Dodgers
closed to one game behind Arizona in the National League West.</TE>
<TE>   It was a game that quickly swung the Dodgers' way.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto starter Justin Miller--a rookie from Torrance who played
in the 1992 Little League World series before going on to Torrance
High and L.A. Harbor College--had a crowd of 150 in the stands to
watch him.</TE>
<TE>   But Miller (4-4) lasted only 27 pitches and didn't get out of the
first.</TE>
<TE>   The third batter he faced was Green--and with two men already on,
Green connected with Miller's first pitch for a 440-foot home run to
right-center.</TE>
<TE>   Now famous for hitting homers in spurts, Green has five in the
last five games, 21 on the season and 18 since May 21.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a good streak. I just keep going out and trying to hit
it hard," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii found a rhythm that had been missing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my timing in my other starts, maybe I was a little fast,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also experimented by going to the stretch early in the game,
just "to get more smooth," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the first four innings Ishii gave up only two hits and one
run--a second-inning homer by rookie Joe Lawrence, Lawrence's first
in the major leagues.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't give up another run until the fifth, on Dave Berg's RBI
double.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii was coming off a poor performance Friday against the Angels
when he lasted only three innings, giving up six runs.</TE>
<TE>   That and other roller coaster rides have left pitching coach Jim
Colborn searching for key points in Ishii's delivery to try to help
him become more consistent.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of moving parts," Colborn said. "You might describe
[his delivery] as violent. It isn't exactly simple."</TE>
<TE>   Other theories have abounded, from whether Ishii's routine between
starts in the U.S.--so different from the structured,
practice-intensive Japanese methods--isn't working for him, to
whether major league scouting is catching up to him after his
dramatic start.</TE>
<TE>   Colborn doesn't put much stock in the training-methods theory.</TE>
<TE>   And scouting? Colborn scoffs: "I've seen him pitch every game, and
I don't know what his tendencies are."</TE>
<TE>   It's not that anybody can quibble with Ishii's record--only the
anxiety his methods sometimes induce.</TE>
<TE>   There was little of that Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the word tonight is steady. That's something unlike what
we've seen the last four or five games," Tracy said.</TE>

<HD>Struggling Beltre Gets a Short Break</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With Adrian Beltre mired in a two-for-24 slump over his last seven
games, Dodger Manager Jim Tracy took the third baseman out of the
lineup Wednesday in hopes a day off might help.</LD>
<LD>   "There was a similar situation a while back with Shawn Green,"
Tracy said. "I felt it was a necessary step, and I feel it's now time
for me to step in and give him a day where he can get away from it.
We've tried all the other avenues already."</LD>
<LD>   Tracy said Beltre, who came into the game in the eighth inning as
a defensive replacement, "presumably" will be back in the lineup
today. Dave Hansen replaced him at third Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Beltre, batting .241, hasn't been speaking to the media and
declined interview requests.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him, 'I'm going to give you a day off,' and he said, 'I
just had one Monday,' " Tracy said. "The player will always fight you
on that.... As of right now, I would put him back out there
tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers lowered the flags to half-staff and held a moment of
silence for Hall of Fame broadcaster Jack Buck, recalling Buck's
famous call of Kirk Gibson's home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger broadcaster Vin Scully called Buck "a gruff-voiced guy with
a big heart," and Dodger coach Jack Clark, a former Cardinal,
remembered the St. Louis broadcaster as a close friend</TE>
<TE>   "He was always there for you," Clark said. "He wanted to see you
do good and he wanted to see the Cardinals do good. If you were a
Cardinal, you were part of Jack Buck's family.... He was class all
the way around.</TE>
<TE>   "He made me feel like a son. It's really sad."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After skipping a start to relieve biceps tendinitis, left-hander
Omar Daal will start Saturday against Boston, Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   Daal said he had only "regular soreness" the day after throwing in
the bullpen Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii will make his first community appearance
since joining the Dodgers this season Friday at the Ardmore
Recreation Center in Seoul International Park at 3250 Marino Street.</TE>
<TE>   Registration for the clinic for boys and girls ages 6-14 begins at
10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Vice President Tom Lasorda and coach Manny Mota also will
participate.</TE>

<HD>Taking Away Their Best Shots</HD>
<DH>World Cup: Germany's Kahn and U.S.'s Friedel are widely
considered tournament's best goalkeepers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Goalkeepers live in a world of their own, a circumscribed universe
bounded by white lines and filled with long periods of calm
interspersed with moments of sheer terror.</LD>
<LD>   It is where most of the drama takes place on a soccer field, where
flying elbows and flying feet intensify the action and where games
inevitably are won or lost.</LD>
<LD>   To inhabit that world takes a special kind of player, and the
United States and Germany, who face each other in an intriguing
quarterfinal on Friday night, have two of the best in the business.</LD>
<TE>   Oliver Kahn is Germany's keeper and captain, a man generally
acknowledged to be the finest in the world at his craft. Brad Friedel
is the American goalkeeper who will be staring at Kahn from the
opposite end of the field in Ulsan, South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Friedel has been the rock upon which the American team's World Cup
challenge has been built, a last line of defense that, so far at
least, has been bent but not broken. It has been Friedel's saves, as
much as anything, that has gotten the U.S. to this point.</TE>
<TE>   Kahn, 33, plays for Bayern Munich in Germany. Friedel, 31, plays
for Blackburn Rovers in England. During this World Cup, they have
been rated as the top two keepers in the tournament, although the
order depends on whom is rating them.</TE>
<TE>   Good as Friedel has been, and he has been excellent, he still
regards Kahn as the best in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "I rate him very highly," Friedel said. "He's a goalkeeper who has
played at the highest level for I don't know how many years now. You
don't play at those levels by being ordinary.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a solid goalkeeper. He's the captain as well, so he's got to
be a leader on the field. He's got to be well-respected by people who
play against him and people who play with him.</TE>
<TE>   "He tends not to say too many controversial things in the papers.
I've seen one or two, but nothing that big. I think he's just a guy
who goes out and does his job."</TE>
<TE>   Friedel is a student of goalkeeping and Kahn is one he studies
closely.</TE>
<TE>   "You always have to learn," he said. "The day you stop learning is
the day you should probably hang up the boots. If you're not willing
to accept that you have things to work on, or if you want to close
your eyes to other people's performance, then I think you run into
problems."</TE>
<TE>   Friedel, who first honed his craft at UCLA under goalkeeper coach
Tim Harris, is not particular about whom he learns from, saying that
he keeps track of keepers at every level.</TE>
<TE>   "I watch them a lot," he said. "Sometimes you can learn as much
from watching a goalkeeper in the third division as you can from
watching a World Cup game. There are little things. Club football is
much different from international football."</TE>
<TE>   Kahn is the man American players see as the main obstacle standing
between them and a place in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   "We have great goalies, but Kahn is definitely one of the best in
the world," said midfielder Earnie Stewart. "To say that he has
weakness, no, no. I've looked at him in this World Cup again and he's
solid. He's rock solid."</TE>
<TE>   Forward Brian McBride realizes that all too well.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a good goalie," McBride said. "The only way you beat a good
goalie is with good shots."</TE>
<TE>   The man known in Germany as "King Kahn" or "the Teutonic Titan"
has unquestioned support from Rudi Voeller, Germany's coach and
Kahn's former teammate on the national team.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a world-class keeper and is in world-class form," Voeller
said. "Because of our forward-oriented game, opponents always have
the chance to occasionally sneak one or two shots in and he has to
make many saves of that nature."</TE>
<TE>   Kahn is renowned for his ability to maintain his nerve when going
one on one with opposing forwards.</TE>
<TE>   He also is superb on set pieces such as free kicks and corner
kicks, with a safe pair of hands that have frequently saved his club
and country from defeat.</TE>
<TE>   The same can be said of Friedel.</TE>
<TE>   The game very well could come down to penalty kicks and the focus
then would be on the two keepers.</TE>
<TE>   Friedel is unlikely to buckle under the pressure. In fact, he said
it doesn't exist in that situation.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no pressure on a goalkeeper on a penalty kick," he said.
"We are not supposed to save it. That's why whenever you do, it's a
big thing. The bigger the event, the more pressure gets heaped on the
player [who is taking the kick]."</TE>

<HD>British Open Figures to Be Hard</HD>

<LD>So now the Tiger Woods bandwagon packs up and heads to Scotland,
where the third stage of the Tour de Slam takes place at stuffy,
straight-laced and hard-as-a-rock Muirfield.</LD>
<LD>   Woods probably is going to play only once before the July 18-21
British Open--the Western Open at Cog Hill near Chicago, two weeks
before--and that should give him plenty of time to figure out how to
do battle with Muirfield and come out on top again.</LD>
<LD>   The early line on Muirfield is that the weather conditions have
been near perfect, which means the Royal and Ancient is going to get
the kind of setup it dearly wants: high rough, hard fairways with
some run to them and even harder greens.</LD>
<TE>   In other words, just the way Muirfield is supposed to play.</TE>
<TE>   If the fairways are hard, then balls are going to run like crazy
and that means they could wind up in the rough or in one of the 148
bunkers. Then if you mix in some wind, it's easy to see that keeping
the ball in play is going to be the biggest task for Woods, and for
everyone else, for that matter.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time the British Open has been played at
Muirfield since 1992, when Nick Faldo won his second title there and
his third Open Championship in all. Little has changed in the 10
years, although the par-three fourth has been lengthened 33 yards to
213 yards and the par-three 13th is 32 yards longer and now plays 191
yards.</TE>
<TE>   The course measures 7,034 yards with a par of 71.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the players will find the usual perception of Muirfield
that is fair," said Peter Dawson, secretary of the Royal and Ancient.</TE>
<TE>   But is it going to be fairer for Woods? All you really need to
know is that it was Jack Nicklaus' favorite course and, with the same
kind of length, domination and focus, Woods is more like Nicklaus in
his prime than anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Trevino on Tiger</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the player who stopped Nicklaus at Muirfield in 1972,
after Nicklaus won the Masters and the U.S. Open, doesn't think
anyone can stop Woods. Lee Trevino says Woods can adjust to anything.</TE>
<TE>   And don't tell Trevino that Woods isn't a shotmaker.</TE>
<TE>   "Evidently they haven't been watching Tiger hook it around trees
and come out of rough and hit high shots and low shots and chip shots
and bunker shots. What, are you kidding me? He's the best shotmaker
out there. Name me a player who can hit more shots than Tiger Woods
right now. Not a shotmaker? Not his strength? Tiger can hit any
shot."</TE>
<TE>   Muirfield can be handled, Trevino said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any course is difficult for Tiger, as strong as he
is. The one thing that people keep forgetting is how dedicated he is.
When you have the most talent and you're the strongest and you're the
most dedicated, it doesn't surprise me what he's done.</TE>
<TE>   "He hits the ball so high, like Nicklaus, it doesn't matter if the
greens are soft or hard. The wind does blow a bit, but I don't think
it will hurt you because the course isn't right on top of the water.</TE>
<TE>   "If they catch a hard, dry course with a tremendous amount of
rough, it's very dangerous. But the way [Tiger] hits a two-iron, I
mean, he can roll it 300 yards. He may not hit any woods there."</TE>
<TE>   Trevino, who beat Nicklaus by one shot in the 1972 Open at
Muirfield, says he never was intimidated by Nicklaus and instead
established him as his target.</TE>
<TE>   "Tiger is setting the bar now. Can you reach it? First, you have
to jump up and touch it. I could touch it when Jack set it. A lot of
these guys can't touch that bar Tiger is setting right now."</TE>
<TE>   History Lesson</TE>
<TE>   We know that Nicklaus is the last person to win the Masters and
the U.S. Open in the same year, but it's interesting that when he did
it in 1972, he three-putted the final hole at Pebble Beach and won by
three shots.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, of course, three-putted the final hole at Bethpage Black
and won by three shots. And while Muirfield is next for Woods, it was
also next for Nicklaus 30 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Open Closed</TE>
<TE>   No one can be any more pleased than Woods that the U.S. Open is
over. Actually, there were plenty of winners and losers all over the
Black Course at Bethpage State Park, so let's check the final
statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Winner: Woods, obviously. He missed a day of practice the week
before the tournament and stayed in bed all day in Orlando, Fla. But
once he got on the course it was a different story. He led or was
tied for the lead the last 67 holes and if that's not domination,
nothing is. At 26, he's now four years ahead of Nicklaus' pace of
winning an eighth major.</TE>
<TE>   Loser: Sergio Garcia. Subtitled: How to go from hero to chump in
two days. Consider how the yells from the crowd changed from "Go,
Sergio!" to 'Hit the damn ball!" If his incessant waggling while he
has an iron in his hands wasn't irritating enough, then the obscene
gesture he made to the crowd, his club-tossing and ball-slamming and
his childish complaint that Woods gets all the breaks get the nod.
Paired with Woods for the final round, he was a nonfactor and got
steamrollered.</TE>
<TE>   Winner: NBC. With an 8.9 national Nielsen rating Sunday, the Open
was watched by a record 55 million over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Loser: NBC. Tampering with the start time of the last group to
influence ratings, preferring it to be set at 3:30 p.m. EDT despite a
strong likelihood of thunderstorms (which delayed play 49 minutes),
the network nearly caused its highest-rated Open not to be completed
on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Winner: The U.S. Golf Assn. It scored a huge hit playing at a
public course and accepted big-time public relations bouquets.</TE>
<TE>   Loser: The USGA. Incredibly, it almost went for a 4 p.m.
last-group tee time. Bowing down to broadcast partner NBC and
agreeing to a 3:30 p.m. time was a double bogey and nearly a
disqualification. NBC has lost the NFL, the NBA and Major League
Baseball, so you don't have to roll over. Who's running this Open? It
would have been nice to ask executive director David Fay, but he was
in the NBC tower at the 18th hole.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Faldo, Scott Hoch, Nick Price, Jay Haas. Face it, there
are trees at Bethpage Black that aren't as old as this foursome.
Score one for the AARP Squad. Hoch (46) and Faldo (44) tied for
fifth, Price (45) tied for eighth and Haas (48) tied for 12th.</TE>
<TE>   Winner: John Daly. Not only did he make the cut, Daly came back
from an 84 with a 74 on Sunday, while playing his round in three
hours flat. Next week, you can see Daly paired with Craig Breedlove
at the Bonneville Salt Flats.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: The par-four 15th, the 459-yard killer to an elevated
green fronted by bunkers, was the toughest hole at the Open, playing
to a 4.6 average. The 499-yard 12th and the 492-yard 10th--the
longest par fours in Open history--were the second and third toughest
holes.</TE>
<TE>   Loser: Anybody who believes Tiger would actually sleep in his car
to play Bethpage Black, as he said he would. Tiger does not sleep in
cars, he sells them.</TE>
<TE>   Cover Up</TE>
<TE>   News item: Sports Illustrated puts U.S. soccer player Landon
Donovan, not Woods, on its cover this week.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: This is no surprise. The magazine did something similar
after Woods won the 2000 British Open at St. Andrews (a victory that
meant he had won all four major titles, by the way), but William
"Refrigerator" Perry was on the cover to tease a where-are-they-now
story.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: If Tiger wins at Muirfield, he's a cinch for the
cover, unless, of course, there's a big T-ball game that week.</TE>
<TE>   Numbers Game</TE>
<TE>   They must have plenty of time on their hands at Nike Golf, because
somebody figured that Woods had walked 282 miles in his swooshed
shoes while playing in his 22 professional majors.</TE>
<TE>   X Marks the Spot</TE>
<TE>   Miller Barber, 71, shot a first-round 67 at the BellSouth Senior
Classic, to better his age by four shots.</TE>
<TE>   Ciphering</TE>
<TE>   Remember James Mason, the teaching pro from Dillard, Ga., who was
a Monday qualifier and won a senior tour event a couple of weeks ago?
Mason, a homespun type, says he didn't really have a favorite subject
in college.</TE>
<TE>   Said Mason: "I majored in trying to get a diploma when I was at
Auburn. I ended up getting 50 hours in accounting, so I can add and
subtract a little bit now."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan Sighting</TE>
<TE>   And if you're wondering what Michael Jordan is up to, wonder no
more. He's heading for the golf course to play in next month's
American Century Celebrity Championship at Edgewood Tahoe Golf
Course.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, Jason Kidd, John Elway, Mario Lemieux, Chris Webber, Jerry
Rice, Marshall Faulk, Warren Sapp and five-time winner Rick Rhoden
are all scheduled to play in the tournament, July 19-21.</TE>
<TE>   Birdies, Bogeys, Pars</TE>
<TE>   Orange County businesses will hold a tournament Monday at Pelican
Hill. The event benefits senior citizen services. Details: (949)
498-0400.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis Strange, Ray Floyd, Mark O'Meara, Sam Torrance and Faldo
have accepted special invitations to play in the UBS Warburg Cup at
Sea Island, Ga. The 40-and-up event features two 12-player teams from
the United States and the rest of the world in a Ryder Cup type
format. The event will be played Nov. 15-17, with Arnold Palmer and
Gary Player the captains.</TE>

<HD>Rungo's Direction Turned Arlington Into Champion</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Southern Section baseball playoff pairings were released in
mid-May, unseeded Riverside Arlington was considered, at best, a dark
horse.</LD>
<LD>   Not that Coach Gary Rungo and his players didn't feel more like
thoroughbreds.</LD>
<LD>   "The kids used [the perceived snub] as motivation," said Rungo,
whose team won the Ivy League by four games. "They got fired up about
it."</LD>
<TE>   Arlington recorded four shutouts in the playoffs, including a 1-0
victory over Santa Margarita in the championship game, to win the
Division III title. The Lions (25-6) won their five playoff games by
a combined score of 11-3.</TE>
<TE>   Arlington prevailed because of Rungo's guidance and the leadership
of junior pitchers Joe Reyes and Zack Zinicola, who combined for
three complete games in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Rungo, The Times' baseball coach of the year, also credited his
assistants, infield coach John Costa, outfield coach John Wilbur and
pitching coach Robert Lunetta.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt we deserved to win every game we played because of the way
we practiced," he said. "I was upset the season was over because I
wasn't going to be around these guys anymore."</TE>

<HD>El Dorado's Wong Knows the Value of a Late-Season Charge</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When it came to coaching high school softball in Southern California
this year, Melissa Wong's results were a little better than most.</LD>
<LD>   A second-year coach at Placentia El Dorado, Wong has been selected
The Times' softball coach of the year primarily because of her
late-season push that helped the Golden Hawks win the Southern
Section Division II championship, their first since 1977.</LD>
<LD>   El Dorado tied for second with two other teams in the Empire
League. However, Wong did what coaches are supposed to do--get her
team to peak at the right time, with sophomore pitcher Amanda Watkins
and gritty senior third baseman Kristi Durant leading the way during
the playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   El Dorado (21-9) took the title in the section's toughest
division, winning the last three games against then-ranked teams: 2-1
over No. 2 Santa Ana Foothill in 11 innings, 3-0 over No. 7 Whittier
California and 2-1 over No. 9 La Palma Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   By beating Kennedy, the Golden Hawks avenged two shutout losses to
their league champion.</TE>
<TE>   And they did it without a player earning all-region honors. Team
of the year? Absolutely. Coach of the year? Definitely.</TE>

<HD>Nothing Stopped Turner</HD>

<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The flesh-colored wrapping around her right elbow was hardly
noticeable. She never mentioned it after victories or after her final
defeat.</LD>
<LD>   Michelle Turner, a La Palma Kennedy senior, never used her injured
elbow as an excuse for not being able to throw her full repertoire of
pitches. But allowing only three runs over the final 135 innings of
the season hardly demanded any excuses.</LD>
<LD>   Turner, The Times' softball player of the year, is as classy as
she is dominant.</LD>
<TE>   Turner finished with a 23-5 record, an 0.19 earned-run average,
259 strikeouts, 12 walks--and only three wild pitches--in 221
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Loara Coach Scott Weber, whose team faced Kennedy twice in
each of the last four years, said Turner was tougher than ever even
though she had fewer strikeouts this season.</TE>
<TE>   "She wasn't even the same player as last year," Weber said. "You
could see her determination ... the approach that, 'I'll throw my
best stuff and if you can hit it, good luck.' She was much more
dominating this year than last year."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, when Turner was selected the Orange County player of
the year, she was 18-3, had an 0.12 ERA and opponents batted .110
against her in 172 innings.</TE>
<TE>   This season, opponents again batted .110 in 53 more innings.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she pitched the last few games on heart alone," said
Santa Ana Mater Dei Coach Doug Myers, whose team was shut out by
Turner in the Southern Section Division II quarterfinals. "She was
limited on some of the pitches she could throw.</TE>
<TE>   "She has a terrific riseball that she used only sparingly because
of her elbow injury," he said. "It shows the true champion she is,
that she was able to get by with another dimension of her game."</TE>
<TE>   Turner's 2-0 victory over Mater Dei was her 14th consecutive
shutout--her 21st of the season.</TE>
<TE>   In her next game, Turner's streak of consecutive scoreless innings
ended at 121--three short of the section record--when she allowed a
run in the 16th inning against Riverside Poly.</TE>
<TE>   Like the section record-holder, Moreno Valley Valley View's Keira
Goerl, Turner will attend UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she's just beginning to reach her potential," Myers said.
"And when she gets to UCLA, she'll really realize that."</TE>
<TE>   The season ended for Turner in the division's championship game.
She gave up two runs--one of them earned--in a 2-1 loss to Placentia
El Dorado, a team she had shut out twice during Empire League play.</TE>
<TE>   As gracious as she had been in earlier playoff victories, Turner
was equally gracious in defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "They just played a little harder than we did," she said, making
no excuses.</TE>

<LD>   When asked about the highlight of a season in which he made major

<TE>   When it comes to coaches' lists of the finest players in Southern
California, Young is almost always at the top. The Times' baseball
player of the year batted .542 with 17 home runs and 56 runs batted
in as a junior for the Southern Section Division I champions.</TE>
<TE>   "He hit curveballs, fastballs and pitches up, down and around,"
said Lakewood Coach Spud O'Neil, whose team had the task this season
of facing Young three times--all losses. "He's probably the best
player I've seen in my career in 31 years. If they drafted juniors,
he would be the No. 1 choice."</TE>
<TE>   Young was at his best in the playoffs, when he pitched and hit
Camarillo to the title. He had a game-winning home run in the eighth
inning of a 3-2 second-round victory over Rialto Eisenhower, then
pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings of relief to seal a 2-1 quarterfinal
victory over Palos Verdes Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   In the semifinal, Young gave up four hits in 6 1/3 innings and hit
a mammoth home run as Camarillo pounded Long Beach Poly, 7-3. His
two-run double keyed the Scorpions' 8-1 victory over Lakewood in the
title game.</TE>
<TE>   Young's pitching was nearly as impressive as his hitting. He
finished 5-1 with three saves, a 1.67 earned-run average and 51
strikeouts in 46 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see anything else he could do on the high school level,"
O'Neil said. "He needs to get to the next level."</TE>
<TE>   One remaining achievement would be the section's season home run
record of 20. Young seemed on pace to shatter the record when he had
14 by late April, but he didn't see many pitches in the strike zone
the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't hitting the ball like I was capable," Young said earlier
this week by phone from Joplin, Mo., where he is trying out for the
Junior National Team. "I was hitting line drives."</TE>
<TE>   Young said his goals for next season are to get in better shape
and win another section title.</TE>
<TE>   "Setting the home run record is not a big deal," Young said. "It
will come if the season is going all right."</TE>

<LD>For those who don't think there's enough action on Breeders' Cup Day,
proposition wagers are about to become a reality on racing's biggest
day.</LD>
<LD>   Starting with this year's Breeders' Cup, which will be run for the
first time at Arlington Park on Oct. 26, fans will be able to make
head-to-head bets on whether one horse will beat another in a
specific race.</LD>
<LD>   Other prop wagers that could be offered include a Europe vs.
America on the day's three turf races--the Mile, the Turf and the
Filly and Mare Turf. Players would be asked to select whether an
American or European-based horse would win a specific race, and a
jockey prop on which rider would win the most races on the card.</LD>
<TE>   Returning to Hollywood Park, the most interesting race on today's
card might be the sixth, a 1 1/16-mile contest for maidens.</TE>
<TE>   Second in the Alydar on May 23 behind eventual Belmont Stakes
also-ran Like A Hero, World Light will be in with non-winners today
as he tries for the third time to win his first race.</TE>
<TE>   The 3-year-old son of Broad Brush has been second in both of his
races, but he is not a slam dunk today.</TE>
<TE>   His opponents include Gravitate, who was a sharp second to Rock
Cod Johnny going seven furlongs and looks ready to go long for
trainer Bob Baffert, and Battler Bob, a $425,000 yearling purchase
who has been second in all five of his races for trainer Neil
Drysdale.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Pleasantly Perfect will add blinkers as he seeks
his second win for trainer Richard Mandella in Hollywood Park's
seventh, a $51,000 allowance at 1 1/16 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: David Flores. He had the highest win percentage (24) of
any jockey in the top five at Hollywood Park at the start of this
week.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Richard Destasio. The New York-based trainer is three
for 56 this year.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Avian and Belongstospeed in
the fifth, Gravitate and World Light in the seventh, singling
Pleasantly Perfect in the seventh and using Bin Rejoicing, Half Moon
and My Kimberlee Anne in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/110. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $16.40/$644.60. Total money bet: $706.</TE>

<HD>Schilling's Bid for 13th Win Is Foiled</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Batista hit a two-run homer and Gary Matthews Jr. had a two-run
triple as the Baltimore Orioles spoiled Curt Schilling's bid for his
13th victory with a 6-1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on
Wednesday night at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling (12-3) has lost consecutive decisions for the first time
in 31 regular-season starts since last July 8.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling, who made his major league debut with Baltimore in 1988
and spent most of three seasons with the Orioles, gave up six runs
and seven hits. He also threw a wild pitch that was crucial to
Baltimore's three-run sixth inning.</LD>
<TE>   He struck out 10--his eighth double-digit game this season and the
71st of his career--and increased his major league-leading season
total to 160.</TE>
<TE>   But he was defeated for the second time since his career-best
nine-game winning streak was ended in a 6-3 loss to Detroit last
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 8, Tampa Bay 0--Jason Schmidt struck out 11 batters
in his first career shutout as the Giants defeated the Devil Rays at
San Francisco without retaliating for the pitch thrown behind Barry
Bonds a night earlier.</TE>
<TE>   In his 164th career start, Schmidt (3-2) gave up five hits for his
first shutout and his seventh career complete game. Among active
pitchers, only Jason Bere (185 starts) has been waiting longer for
his first shutout.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 3, Boston 2--Rookie Julius Matos doubled in the go-ahead
run with one out in the seventh inning and Red Sox starter Frank
Castillo was ejected a few moments later as the Padres won at San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo appeared to bump third base umpire Bill Welke before he
was restrained by teammates. Castillo (5-7) apparently was angry
about being called for a balk just before giving up Matos' double,
which gave San Diego a 2-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   New York Yankees 20, Colorado 10--Robin Ventura and John Vander
Wal each drove in four runs at Denver as the Yankees kept up their
hitting barrage at Coors Field.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura, Jason Giambi and Alfonso Soriano homered for the Yankees.
New York now has 30 runs, 35 hits and six homers in two days at
Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 3, Pittsburgh 2--John Mabry's single in the 10th inning at
Pittsburgh drove in the Athletics' first run since Miguel Tejada's
two-run homer in the first, and Oakland's interleague record improved
to 10-1.</TE>
<TE>   New York Mets 4, Minnesota 2--Al Leiter pitched into the eighth
inning and surprisingly had two hits for the Mets at New York.
Leiter, one of the worst-hitting pitchers, went two for three with a
key double to raise his career average to .095 and scored a run.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 7, Chicago Cubs 4--Cub reliever Jeff Fassero threw a wild
pitch with the bases loaded at Chicago to let in the go-ahead run for
the Rangers, who won for the first time in extra innings.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Sosa hit his 26th homer for Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 4, Detroit 1--Chipper Jones had two doubles and an RBI,
breaking out of a 1-for-13 skid, and Julio Franco and Gary Sheffield
hit consecutive homers in the eighth to lead the Braves at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 4, Chicago White Sox 3--Pinch-hitter Jason Michaels'
RBI single in the ninth inning led the Phillies to a comeback victory
over the White Sox at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 6, Kansas City 3--At Montreal, Tomo Ohka won his fourth
consecutive decision as the Expos tied a season high with their sixth
consecutive victory.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Former Reds make the difference in helping
Mariners to 2-0 victory at Cincinnati.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>Junior got outplayed by the guy who replaced him. Bret Boone did a
number on the rest of his family too.</LD>
<LD>   And once Freddy Garcia got rolling, the Cincinnati Reds had no
chance.</LD>
<LD>   Boone and Mike Cameron hit homers, and the Seattle Mariners rode
another impressive start by Garcia to a 2-0 victory Wednesday night
that nudged the teams in opposite directions.</LD>
<TE>   The Mariners stretched their lead to three games in the American
League West, while the Reds fell two games behind St. Louis in the
National League Central--their biggest deficit since April 22.</TE>
<TE>   "You just have to live through it and keep pushing," Red Manager
Bob Boone said. "We faced a guy who was awful tough tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia (10-4) gave up three hits in eight innings and retired the
last 12 batters he faced, winning his sixth consecutive start. He
also had a single and a double.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia easily handled a lineup that had Ken Griffey Jr. back for
the second consecutive game. Griffey was hit by a pitch in the first
inning, grounded out and struck out before getting a single.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron led off the second with a homer against Elmer Dessens
(4-3), ending a 0-for-12 slump. He replaced Griffey in center field
in Seattle after their February 2000 trade.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt like old times," Cameron said. "It felt good to do that.
I did what you're supposed to do if you get a pitch to hit, and the
ball carries well in this park."</TE>
<TE>   Boone led off the fourth with his ninth homer. The second baseman
also made the pivotal play in the first inning, diving onto the
outfield grass to snag Sean Casey's grounder and then throwing him
out from his knees with two runners aboard.</TE>
<TE>   "I did it for a lot of years in Cincinnati," said Boone, who won a
Gold Glove and set a major league fielding record for second basemen
with the Reds. "I'm very happy with that side of it. The frustrations
I've had have been at the plate."</TE>
<TE>   Boone is hitting .232, but has been sensational in the field.</TE>

<LD>There is a sameness about the card tonight that begins a new week at
Los Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   There are no races for Arabians or thoroughbreds and nothing
around a turn. All eight contests are for quarter horses at either
300 or 350 yards, but there is the spice of a pick-six carryover of
$21,026.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the most interesting race is the third, a 300-yard dash
for 2-year-old maidens.</LD>
<TE>   The field of seven features three first-time starters from solid
barns, including Secretary For Life, a chestnut daughter of Apollo.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by the Vessels Stallion Farm and trained by Danny Cardoza,
who won with eight of his first 22 starters at the meet, Secretary
For Life worked in 12.50 seconds from the gate at Los Alamitos
earlier in the month. She will leave from Post 5 and be ridden by Joe
Badilla Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Especialy Red Hot. 2. Rock N Fastball. 3. Willie
Awesome. 4. Amys Dash. 5. Oh Whata Beduino. 6. Takin The Fast Lane.
7. Talking Tactics. 8. Hugo Rules.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use She Is Classic, Especialy Red Hot and Miss Absolut in
the first, single Rock N Fastball in the second, use Willie Awesome,
Secretary For Life and Sharin The Cash in the third and Amys Dash,
Indigo Dash and Breaking Up in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Cathedral adds Lasix in the fifth after a

<HD>Castillo Runs Hitting Streak to 33</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Sixth-inning dribbler does trick to tie him with
Hornsby in Florida's 2-1 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>With two hits, a run batted in and a run scored, Luis Castillo beat
the Cleveland Indians and tied Rogers Hornsby.</LD>
<LD>   "Who?" Castillo said.</LD>
<LD>   Even though his grasp on baseball history is shaky, he's creating
some himself. Castillo matched Hornsby's 80-year record for the
longest hitting streak by a second baseman, going two for four to
make it 33 games in a row Wednesday night as the Florida Marlins
defeated Cleveland, 2-1.</LD>
<TE>   Castillo had a hand in both Florida runs. He was 0 for 2 before
beating out a dribbler to the pitcher in the sixth inning, and he
scored the tying run on Cliff Floyd's single.</TE>
<TE>   His one-out single to right in the seventh drove in Preston
Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   "Luis took care of his hit," Florida Manager Jeff Torborg said. "I
was thinking about the game. Then Luis took care of that too."</TE>
<TE>   Castillo tied four players at 33 games in a row--Hornsby of St.
Louis in 1922, Heinie Manush of Washington in 1933, Hal Chase of the
New York Yankees in 1907 and George Davis of the New York Giants in
1893.</TE>
<TE>   Only 15 players have had a longer streak, including only four
since 1949.</TE>
<TE>   "Tomorrow is a new day," Castillo said. "Four more at-bats. I
start over."</TE>
<TE>   The speedy leadoff hitter extended the streak when he topped a 1-0
pitch that pitcher Danys Baez fielded on the second hop between the
mound and plate. Baez's hurried throw sailed over first baseman Jim
Thome, and Castillo continued to second.</TE>
<TE>   Official scorer Ron Jernick immediately credited Castillo with a
hit and charged Baez with an error for allowing the runner to
advance. TV replays confirmed the call, showing that Castillo reached
first as the throw sailed past.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think his feet hit the ground," teammate Derrek Lee said.
"He wanted it bad."</TE>
<TE>   Castillo raised his average to .401 during the streak and .338
this season.</TE>
<TE>   The game drew only 9,428, which is below Florida's season average
of 11,220.</TE>

<HD>Neilson Elected to Hall of Fame</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Coach of eight teams, including 28-game stint with
Kings, is picked in the builders' category.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roger Neilson never has cared much for convention. Through coaching
stints with eight teams, including a 28-game tenure with the Kings in
the 1983-84 season, he rode his bicycle nearly everywhere, wore
shorts year-round and rummaged through bargain bins for the $5 ties
he reluctantly knotted around his neck on game days.</LD>
<LD>   But his election Wednesday to the Hockey Hall of Fame, the most
significant rite for a hockey player or administrator, had a profound
effect on hockey's favorite free spirit.</LD>
<LD>   Still fighting multiple myeloma--cancer of the bone marrow--and
survivor of two cancer surgeries in the last three years, Neilson
said he was humbled to have been elected in the builders' category.</LD>
<TE>   "To all of a sudden get this, it's just kind of an extra thing on
top," said Neilson, who turned 68 last weekend. "It seems like it's
amazing.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I relate it to the off-ice [medical] battles. All I
know is I'm really happy and proud about it today."</TE>
<TE>   Elected in the players' category were two-time Norris
trophy-winning defenseman Rod Langway, who had a distinguished career
in Montreal and Washington; forward Bernie Federko, who scored 1,130
points in 1,000 games, mostly with St. Louis, and left wing Clark
Gillies, a member of four Stanley Cup championship teams with the New
York Islanders.</TE>
<TE>   Neilson's selection, however, touched the strongest emotional
chord.</TE>
<TE>   After coaching 1,000 games--including two this season after the
Ottawa Senators briefly promoted him from his assistant coach
position--he seems to know everyone in the game. Many of his friends
had gathered in Toronto on Wednesday to "roast" him at a dinner whose
proceeds are earmarked for two cancer charities. King General Manager
Dave Taylor, who played for Neilson in Los Angeles, counted himself
among the estimated 1,000 people at the event.</TE>
<TE>   "Roger's very well respected," Taylor said. "He's been on the
cutting edge of coaching for a long time. He was one of the first
guys to heavily use videotape to analyze games, and he used tape to
scout teams too.</TE>
<TE>   "He's also been a mentor for a lot of guys. He's run a coaching
clinic in Ontario for 15 years, and he gets established coaches
there, not just up-and-coming coaches."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor recalled seeing Neilson ride his bike to the Forum in
Inglewood, where Neilson--usually accompanied by his dog--would spend
hours reviewing tapes and plotting strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "He was always working tremendously hard at the job," Taylor said.
"He would go home after a game and watch the game over twice, and
then break things down a third time. That was before the technology
we have now."</TE>
<TE>   The four were selected by an 18-member committee of hockey
executives, former players, writers and broadcasters. They will be
inducted into the Hall, in Toronto, on Nov. 4. Also honored were
Kevin Paul Dupont of the Boston Globe and Gilles Tremblay of Montreal
for contributions to print and broadcast journalism, respectively.</TE>

<LD>Martina Navratilova's short-lived return to singles is over, but not
before she showed she can still compete with players nearly half her
age.</LD>
<LD>   The 45-year-old Navratilova lost, 2-6, 6-2, 6-2, to third-seeded
Daniela Hantuchova--a player 26 years younger--at the Eastbourne
grasscourt championships in England on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, playing her first tour singles match in eight years,
Navratilova beat Tatiana Panova, 6-1, 4-6, 6-2, becoming the oldest
woman to win a WTA match.</LD>
<TE>   "I've always taken it one year at a time and I don't know if I'm
even playing next year," Navratilova said after her loss. "But I have
no plans to play singles again.... It was fun and I think that I
showed I had a good time out there and I played some good tennis."</TE>
<TE>   In other matches, top-seeded Jelena Dokic of Yugoslavia lost, 6-4,
1-6, 6-2, to Daja Bedanova of the Czech Republic, and fifth-seeded
American Meghann Shaughnessy defeated Italian Rita Grande, 6-4, 6-2.</TE>

<HD>Rusch Labors but Leads Brewers, 8-1</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Glendon Rusch pitched six shutout innings and the Milwaukee Brewers
defeated the Houston Astros for the third consecutive time, 8-1,
Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Young hit Tim Redding's first pitch 420 feet for his first
home run this season, Jose Hernandez led off the sixth with his 13th
and Richie Sexson led off the seventh with his 18th, a 425-foot shot.</LD>
<LD>   Redding (3-4) gave up only two other hits in six innings. He
walked two and struck out six.</LD>
<TE>   Young had a run-scoring triple in the seventh, his second this
season, to put the Brewers ahead, 4-0.</TE>
<TE>   Rusch (4-5) labored through his six innings, giving up five hits
and walking four but repeatedly getting out of jams. He threw 71 of
his 116 pitches in the first three innings, when he walked three and
stranded six.</TE>
<TE>   After a 1-2-3 fourth, Brian Hunter led off the fifth with a double
but was trapped off the bag when Craig Biggio flied out weakly to
first on a failed hit and run.</TE>
<TE>   The Astros put runners at first and third with one out in the
sixth, but Gregg Zaun fouled out and Julio Lugo looked at strike
three.</TE>
<TE>   The Brewers scored four times against Scott Linebrink in the
eighth, including Robert Machado's two-run double.</TE>

<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>That's what they tell you, sure. It says "Seoul" on the hotel
stationery, "Seoul" on the plane ticket, "Seoul" on the press kit.
But if you believe that, the next thing they'll try to do is sell you
a ticket for a World Cup quarterfinal between Turkey and Senegal.</LD>
<LD>   Where was the connection to the outer space black hole on the
flight from Tokyo to, ahem, "Seoul"?</LD>
<LD>   (I apparently missed it while engrossed in a travel brochure about
Suwon, capital of the Korean "toilet culture." Suwon, according to
the promotional literature, boasts the most beautiful public restroom
in all of Korea, the result of the city's famous "Campaign to
Beautify our Toilet" of 1997, featuring "the grandest toilet with
beautiful pictures on the wall, well supplied with current newspapers
and magazines, music playing constantly and the scent of flowers in
the air." A little slice of heaven, that Suwon toilet.)</LD>
<TE>   Where were we again?</TE>
<TE>   That is the question, isn't it?</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, I found myself in a discussion, at least that's how I
remember it, among German and American sportswriters debating a World
Cup quarterfinal matchup between Germany and the United States. I'm
not kidding. The Americans seemed pretty convinced the Americans had
no chance. The German scribe, on the other hand, was very impressed
with U.S. striker Clint Mathis ("I'd rather have him than Klose") and
U.S. Coach Bruce Arena ("He could coach in Europe") and had serious
misgivings about the quality of this German team ("The worst German
World Cup team ever").</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday, I found myself in a news conference, at least to the
best of my recollection, during which a writer asked Arena if he had
seen South Korea's upset of Italy the night before and did he have a
preference for an opponent in the next round, Spain or South Korea?</TE>
<TE>   Arena blinked and paused and smiled and said, "So you're asking
the coach from the United States, 'Who do you prefer to play in the
semifinals of the World Cup?' "</TE>
<TE>   To quote the famed American striker of tennis balls, John McEnroe,
who is very lucky his sport never adopted the red-card concept: You
cannot be serious.</TE>
<TE>   We have been whisked to some uncharted Fourth Dimension of
Football, a parallel soccer universe where up is down, right is left,
France, Argentina, Italy and Portugal are all at home and Senegal,
Turkey, South Korea and the United States are on the doorstep of the
World Cup final four.</TE>
<TE>   According to the official schedule, the U.S. is to play Germany in
one quarterfinal in Ulsan. In Germany, they actually believe this is
going to happen. Germans are taking it seriously.</TE>
<TE>   The German newspaper Bild reports that Germany has a 75% chance of
beating the U.S. in the quarterfinal. Really. This gives the U.S. an
exponentially improved chance of reaching the semifinals, compared to
the 0% it had four days ago.</TE>
<TE>   German assistant coach Michael Skibbe disputes those numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "We can consider us to be in the semifinal," Skibbe says.</TE>
<TE>   And Germany's coach, Rudi Voeller, points out that while it may be
true the "U.S. players are strong in attack ... they have a number of
gaps in defense."</TE>
<TE>   That sounds more like the World Cup we know. Arrogant Germans.
Inadequate Americans. Germany 2, USA 0 in the first round of the 1998
World Cup, with the sequel serving up more of the same Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Or will it?</TE>
<TE>   If this really is the World Cup, and South Korea really did
eliminate Italy on a header over Paolo Maldini, and Senegal really
did shoot down France and Sweden, and Turkey really did overcome
45,011 Japanese in Miyagi, then anything is possible ... even, as
ridiculous as it sounds, the U.S. over Germany with a spot in the
semifinals at stake.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans have a few assets going for them, the most important
being that no one outside the team bus actually expects them to win.
Arena, quite shrewdly, plays up the no-hope angle, reminding writers
from both countries that the Germans are bigger and stronger and
looked quite imposing in a 4-2 exhibition victory over the U.S. in
Rostock in late March. "They're supposed to beat us, right?" Arena
says.</TE>
<TE>   Portugal thought the same thing. So did Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   In a tournament where reputation means nothing, the old image of
Americans scratching their heads over the soccer ball and wondering
why they can't pick it up and run plays right into the Americans'
hands.</TE>
<TE>   In a tournament where reputation means nothing, Germany is living
off laurels four, eight, 12, 16, 20 years old. Saudi Arabia didn't
know better and came in scared against the Germans. The Saudis gave
up eight goals. Paraguay's Cesare Maldini, the old Italian weaned on
the fearsome German machines of yore, decided to coach against the
name instead of the reality. Maldini had Paraguay try to play for
penalties--and nearly wound up boring the tournament into the Japan
Sea before Oliver Neuville, thankfully, scored a lone goal.</TE>
<TE>   This is not a great German team, as even the Germans concede. It
lost in the first round of the 2000 European championships. It
struggled to qualify for Korea/Japan 2002. Franz Beckenbauer, who won
World Cups for Germany as a player and coach, says the current German
squad has one world-class player, goalkeeper Oliver Kahn, and a bunch
of "average-to-good" field players who get by on teamwork and
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Miroslav Klose shares the tournament scoring lead with
Brazil's Ronaldo with five goals, although please note the asterisk
attached: *Three goals came against totally discombobulated Saudi
Arabia--and Klose didn't manage much of anything in the must-win
match against Paraguay.</TE>
<TE>   Not creative enough to break down defenses through its midfield,
Germany relies on launching crosses over the top and waiting for the
defense to make a mistake. The U.S. will have to crowd the box, as it
did against Mexico, and probably will need to play three center backs
with two wingers tracking back to help defend, which is how the
Americans shut down Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Germany's back line isn't going to lose many headers, but it is
susceptible to speed. DaMarcus Beasley did not play in Rostock, but
he could figure prominently in Ulsan.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. defender Tony Sanneh, who plays for the German club FC
Nuremberg, says Germany's players "don't have a lot of respect for
us. I think that stems from the [last] World Cup. Germany hasn't been
strong in the last couple years, but their whole thing is, 'Well,
we're a tournament team.'</TE>
<TE>   "And they always have been a tournament team. With the exception
of the last Euro [championships], they've always done great. It's
almost like a sure bet they always get to the semifinals."</TE>
<TE>   And it would seem that way again Friday.</TE>
<TE>   But that's based on knowledge gained from another place and
another time. It is different here, where there is no such thing as a
sure thing, where a Turkey-South Korea final is not yet out of the
question, where the city of Suwon welcomes everyone to come see the
most beautiful toilet in all the land.</TE>

<TE>   YOU SEE, McCarron and I have some history. It's been about a year
since I wrote a column advising bettors to avoid wagering on any
horse ridden by McCarron in the Hollywood Gold Cup. McCarron had lost
the race 18 consecutive times and was my lock of the year to make it
No. 19 on Chris McCarron Bobblehead Day.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron rode Futural in the Gold Cup, crossed the finish line
first, and because something was obviously wrong, the stewards put
their heads together and dropped McCarron's horse to third because
there's no way he could have won the race without doing something
against the rules.</TE>
<TE>   So when McCarron saw me coming Wednesday I expected him to hop on
the nearest horse and take off running. I wasn't worried, though, the
way his horses have been running lately, I knew I'd catch him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I JOKE, of course, because McCarron--like few other athletes in
this town--can take it. He not only can take it, but invites it.</TE>
<TE>   After his retirement announcement, he e-mailed to say: "Just to
fill you in, the REAL reason I retired is because I couldn't take the
pressure leading up to the Gold Cup on July 14th knowing you would be
writing how I cannot win it. I figured I better get out while I can."</TE>
<TE>   I'm still waiting for that first tongue-in-cheek e-mail from Kevin
Brown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "CHRIS is a true champion," said Daryl Dorf, a.k.a. actor Tim
Conway, who in character is probably a few inches taller than
McCarron, and like myself someone who can probably count on one hand
the number of times he's won money on McCarron. "There's going to be
a big hole in the jocks' room when he's done."</TE>
<TE>   They don't make top-flight performers as generous with their time
and articulate as McCarron anymore. And he's had so much to overcome
too, playing hockey as a youngster, and let that be a lesson to all
you kids if you don't want your growth stunted--stay away from
hockey.</TE>
<TE>   Now everybody likes McCarron, and it's almost sickening. There
already have been tons of glowing articles about him, so I say no
need for another one here.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1985 Los Angeles Magazine article, writer Al Stump quoted
actor Cary Grant as saying, "I'd hesitate to lay money against
[McCarron], even if they put him on a lame jackass." I like that
quote because it shows you how old McCarron is. Ask Kobe Bryant if he
knows who Cary Grant is. Ask him if he considers McCarron one of
L.A.'s all-time great athletes.</TE>
<TE>   During the playoffs, Bryant was asked if he thought horses were
athletes, and he said they were, but he wasn't so sure about the guys
who ride around in circles on their backs.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron cut Bryant's comments out of the paper. "I highlighted
what he said, blew it up twice and hung it in the jocks' room--low,
of course, so they could all see it," McCarron said. "I challenge
Kobe to come down here and get on our Equicizer (simulating a horse
ride). Alex Solis would still be pumping 13 minutes later, but I defy
Kobe to last two. We'll see who is an athlete."</TE>
<TE>   Then maybe they can go outside and play one-on-one--best of three.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THEY TELL me McCarron has won 7,137 races in his career. I wish I
had been there for one. They tell me McCarron's horses have earned
more than $264 million with him on their backs, and I'm glad someone
made some money.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough business," he said, and I know, I bet on him to win
Wednesday. "But if I go home after racing five times and tell the
wife I lost four races, I'm a happy camper. Winning 20% of the races
you ride is a good day."</TE>
<TE>   He rode two horses Wednesday and lost them both, but then I guess
no one remembers how many times Babe Ruth struck out. Just once,
though, I'd like to see him point to the finish line like he knows
where it is.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't give me much time. He's riding in a jockey challenge
in Texas on Friday night, and probably will ride five times Saturday
at Hollywood Park, and five more Sunday, finishing his career on Came
Home.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got a good chance to win," jockey Kent Desormeaux said. "If
he takes off that jockey cap, the glare from that bald spot on the
back of his head should blind riders and horses behind him."</TE>
<TE>   Now if I can only get everyone to agree to give him a head start
in his last race.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AS A participant in the seventh annual Rod Carew Children's Cancer
Golf Classic on July 8 at Coto de Caza Country Club, I caution anyone
who would like to join the tournament (www.pcrf-kids.com/carew/) that
Sergio Garcia-like annoying antics will not be tolerated. Anyone
coming with a waggle will win two tickets to a Sparks' game and be
forced to go and sit next to Jack Haley.</TE>
<TE>   My only concern now is Haley might end up in my foursome.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Mike R.:</TE>
<TE>   "Just to have you know, I went to the Dodger game last night,
booed Ra-uuuuuul Mondesi, wrote in Steve Sax for 2B because Mark
Grudzielanek is no better and stuffed the All-Star ballot box with 50
votes for Shawn Green."</TE>
<TE>   I was hoping you might've voted for Chad Kreuter, so he'd get one.</TE>

<HD>Stroke of Tragedy</HD>
<DH>Consequences were fatal when swim portion of the Ironman
Utah triathlon was held despite strong winds, waves</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Winds howling at 50 mph were ravaging the shallow lake, generating
waves so intense in size and frequency that it was nearly impossible
to resist panic.</LD>
<LD>   Swimmers can't panic. It wastes energy, changes breathing
patterns, diverts attention.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't see any boats, I didn't see any buoys and I would
estimate the waves were 6-8 feet," Rachel Rudich said of conditions
at the inaugural Ironman Utah triathlon June 8. "I realized this was
survival mode. The drift, the waves, the current--I don't know all
that was going on out there, but it was nothing like anything I had
experienced before. It was like wild surf from all directions that
never stopped."</LD>
<TE>   Rudich couldn't spot land because of the waves' height. She was
taking breaths quickly as water constantly smacked her face. Swimmers
she'd encounter would immediately disappear on the other side of the
flurry of waves. One man peered into her eyes and confided, "I'm just
trying to stay close to you because I'm scared to death."</TE>
<TE>   By the time officials canceled the swimming portion of the event
and cleared Utah Lake of the 1,536 participants, John Boland, 55, of
Redondo Beach was dead and many others were grateful to be alive.</TE>
<TE>   Right away, the notorious winds that transform Utah Lake near
Provo into what locals call "Killer Lake" were whipping chaos across
the waters.</TE>
<TE>   Gusts were so strong that nearly every six-foot-tall buoy,
anchored by two cinder blocks, had skidded wildly and
indistinguishably far from designated positions.</TE>
<TE>   The hundreds positioned at the starting point were confused by a
lack of instructions. The uncertainty was so great that as many as
half of the entrants began racing before a starting blast was fired.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so dusty on the platform where we were supposed to enter
the water that I had to put my swim goggles on to see," said Rudich,
a 45-year-old from Claremont attempting her fifth Ironman. "The start
was a mess. They were trying to get people in the water, but you
could barely hear the PA system because the wind was just so noisy. I
was standing on the platform, where it was very crowded, then all of
a sudden I heard the gun go off and someone yell, 'Go!' "</TE>
<TE>   The triathletes immediately confronted the stiffest winds
possible, headwinds from the northwest. And minutes into the
scheduled 2.4-mile race, the athletes were thrashing aimlessly, as
far as a quarter-mile south of their assigned--and unmarked--path.</TE>
<TE>   "The waves were coming so suddenly at me that every time I came up
to breathe, I had a mouth full of water," said Gilbert Mancilla, 31,
of Phoenix. "It wasn't long into the race, only about 500 meters,
before I was telling myself, 'This is too much for me.' "</TE>
<TE>   Rudich, trying to remain calm, decided early in the race to switch
from freestyle swimming to breaststroke.</TE>
<TE>   Driving his 26-foot open-bow boat as an event volunteer assigned
to place the course markers, Utah state senator and 30-year Provo
resident Curt Bramble said he made earlier attempts to warn Ironman
officials of the high winds' typical effects on the lake.</TE>
<TE>   "At 6 a.m., I asked an official if he was aware that the severe
winds had been forecast," Bramble said. "He basically dismissed me. I
was told specifically, 'You have no idea about this. These are
world-class athletes who are used to six- to eight-foot ocean
swells.' "</TE>
<TE>   Said swim captain Rob Durrans: "Those of us who knew the lake knew
that race should have never been started, but I had no one to express
that to. I was out on the course in a boat with no radio when all the
officials were at the starting line. When it started, I had no
contact with any of them."</TE>
<TE>   Minutes after the 6:53 a.m. start, Bramble worked to get a better
look at the developing chaos as waves broke across his boat's bow.</TE>
<TE>   He saw Mancilla yelling to be saved. He heard others screaming in
frustration for accurate directions. He scanned the lake and saw no
other boats positioned to assist.</TE>
<TE>   "What I was trying to tell the officials is that there is a lot of
difference in the amplitude of swells in a deep ocean to those on a
seven-foot-deep lake," Bramble said. "The number of waves is
compressed on the lake. This is what I was talking about."</TE>
<TE>   Bramble's inspection of the commotion made his pulse race. He
barked words neither of his three passengers--his 19-year-old
daughter, Mindy; a race official and an Ironman photographer--could
hear because of the screaming winds:</TE>
<TE>   "All hell has broken loose."</TE>
<TE>   Mancilla, a strong bicyclist and runner who said he learned to
swim last summer so he could compete in triathlons, was desperate to
see Bramble. Mancilla was so fatigued his soaking body had to be
tugged aboard.</TE>
<TE>   Bramble returned to the helm and quickly looked to his left.</TE>
<TE>   He saw a body floating face down in the water.</TE>
<TE>   "I pulled the boat close to him, thinking at first that he was
either relaxing or had just gone unconscious," Bramble said. "Because
of the rough waters, there was no way I could grab him by the
wetsuit, though. The body drifted under my boat."</TE>
<TE>   Bramble jumped in the lake and grabbed Boland's lifeless body.</TE>
<TE>   Mindy Bramble, who is CPR-trained, tried to revive Boland by
pumping his chest and instructing Mancilla when to breathe.</TE>
<TE>   "It was shocking," Mancilla said. "I was like, 'My God.' I was on
the verge of tears."</TE>
<TE>   Maria Hopp, a triathlon participant and a doctor from Littleton,
Colo., hopped onto the boat to assist. Curt Bramble used a radio to
inform officials on the shore, "I have an unconscious swimmer with no
pulse," as his powerful boat broke waves at top speed en route back
to the harbor.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to get right back to the race after I left Boland with the
paramedics," Bramble said. "The boat was moving at 50, 55 mph. There
were some kayakers and surfboarders out there trying to help, but
they were struggling. There was really nothing they could do in those
waves."</TE>
<TE>   At shore, Rudich waited anxiously for the other 21 members of her
Inland Inferno triathlon team.</TE>
<TE>   "Being back on land was almost more terrifying," Rudich said.
"There were rumors of several drownings. The paramedics' sirens were
blaring. People were lying on the ground in exhaustion, and many
others were very emotional."</TE>
<TE>   Bramble made three trips to pick up swimmers he described as
"distressed," loading 30 people on his boat the first time, 34 the
second and 42 on the third.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know what getting 42 people on my 26-foot boat looked
like?" Bramble asked. "How about a Haitian refugee camp?"</TE>
<TE>   During the second trip, Bramble said the race official on his boat
told him the swimming portion of the triathlon had been canceled.
Officials had settled on a duathlon consisting of a 70-mile bicycle
race and 13.1-mile run.</TE>
<TE>   Bramble headed to Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo to
visit with Boland's daughter, Jennifer James, and his girlfriend,
Valerie Contreras.</TE>
<TE>   A preliminary autopsy by Utah County medical examiners ruled that
Boland, a retired computer programmer, drowned. A final autopsy
report is expected before the end of June.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad was always up for an adventure," James said. "He never
took the easy way out. He tried hang gliding, but he grew bored. He
tried triathlons and loved them. He always thought it was a better
challenge, and challenges made him happy. He was an inspiration."</TE>
<TE>   James and Contreras have scheduled a public memorial for Boland at
11 a.m. July 13 at Polliwog Park in Manhattan Beach.</TE>
<TE>   They refused to discuss whether they plan to take legal action
against Ironman Utah organizers, Ironman North America.</TE>
<TE>   Ironman North America President Graham Fraser refused to comment
for this story, spokeswoman Priscilla Fraiegari said. Fraser wrote on
the group's Web site that Ironman North America will permanently
retire Boland's race number (1596) and plans to establish a John
Boland Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Lew Friedland, president of World Triathlon Corp., posted a letter
on the Ironman Utah site. His first sentence was, "The last week has
been the saddest and most difficult week in the history of the
Ironman Triathlon."</TE>
<TE>   James defended her father against "a few callous claims on that
Ironman site's chat." She was particularly irked by one comment, that
"this was not a race for the weak."</TE>
<TE>   Boland, among 74 Ironman Utah entrants who were 55 or older, had
finished three 100-mile Western States runs in Northern California,
according to James.</TE>
<TE>   The Ironman Utah was his seventh Ironman event. He finished the
prestigious 1996 Ironman Triathlon in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   "He understood the accomplishment was in finishing," James said.</TE>
<TE>   After the 2001 Ironman Malaysia, Boland posted his diary on the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   In one passage regarding the swimming portion of the event, he
wrote, "It's the best-marked course I've ever seen [once the sun came
up], and I still managed to weave around and get disoriented. I felt
that I was doing OK, but the water was choppy and I had my usual
sucky swim--1:57 according to the official time. I was so happy to
get out of the water."</TE>
<TE>   Said James: "He was a strong swimmer. It was his weakest of the
three events, and he would knock himself about it in a joking way.
But he trained as a swimmer so much. He did ocean training. He took
it very seriously and he worked very hard on it. I mean, he finished
the Ironman Hawaii."</TE>
<TE>   James described Boland as a "wonderful, supportive" father.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a dancer, and I understand how difficult it can be for a
parent whose child is pursuing a career in the arts, but he went in
the backyard and built me a dance studio," James said. "He had many
friends."</TE>
<TE>   Contreras said the Utah triathlon was Boland's first Ironman since
Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   "He was nervous the night before, but excited and much more
relieved in the morning," Contreras said. "He told me, 'I'm so happy
the day is finally here.' Then I became nervous."</TE>
<TE>   Bramble said he is not advising Boland's family to sue Ironman
North America.</TE>
<TE>   He said the organization needs to reevaluate how it addresses race
conditions and answer several questions.</TE>
<TE>   "What was the driving force to start the race--lost entry fees [of
$375], disappointed sponsors?" Bramble asked. "What motivated them to
take these risks? Did they not have a weather report?</TE>
<TE>   "It is untenable to me that they did not have a viable plan in
place for dealing with the winds. They did not just 'blow up,' as
I've heard them say. My question is, did they have a plan? I think
the answer is no. There was no viable procedural manual in place,
nothing safety-wise for the swimmers to rely upon."</TE>
<TE>   Bramble said his daughter, Mindy, couldn't sleep for three days
after administering to Boland.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing we all need to do is come to grips with the idea
that someone has died," Rudich said. "This is difficult to process
for us. Triathletes know there are inherent risks and dangers to what
we do. We won't stop competing. But I'm certain the people who were
in Utah will be wary about swimming in the open water for a long
while."</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Dennis Harris, the Utah Sheriff's spokesman, said his
department is investigating details of Boland's death and detectives
could conclude their findings in three to four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Boland's death was the second drowning at Utah Lake this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Utah Lake's waves are quite dangerous when the wind is blowing,"
Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   "Really, it's like any other lake, though. You have to do your
best to be careful and you must have the appropriate safety equipment
for the activity you are doing on the lake."</TE>

<KH>WORLD CUP QUARTERFINALS UNITED STATES VS. GERMANY</KH>
<HD>Hitting the Big Time</HD>
<DH>Looking for another upset, Americans say their speed will
be equalizer against Germany's size</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Could Shaq come to the rescue? Is Kobe available? Would Phil Jackson
accept a collect call from Bruce Arena?</LD>
<LD>   It's reality time for the U.S. World Cup team, which plays
three-time world champion Germany on Friday night in the
quarterfinals of international soccer's showcase event.</LD>
<LD>   Taking on Germany is an intimidating prospect in the best of
times, and Arena would like some help.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not going to be able to match up physically with the
Germans around the field," he said Wednesday. "That's impossible.
We'd have to go back to the U.S. and get the Lakers to come here and
play for us.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have that kind of size. That's a big team. They're
probably as big as any team in the tournament, and we're not going to
get any taller or any thicker overnight, we know that.</TE>
<TE>   "So we're going to have to make up for it with a little bit of
quickness and some brains."</TE>
<TE>   That's what Friday's game in the South Korean city of Ulsan will
come down to: American speed and execution versus German brawn and
know-how. On the surface, it's no match, but if this World Cup has
been characterized by anything, it's that surface impressions are
merely an illusion.</TE>
<TE>   Ask the players from Argentina, France, Italy and Portugal if they
thought they would be watching on TV from home right now. Upsets have
become almost commonplace and one more would not be that shocking.</TE>
<TE>   Is there a chance the Americans could win? Certainly.</TE>
<TE>   "They pull on their pants and their socks the same way we do,"
midfielder Earnie Stewart said Wednesday. "They're big, and when they
get corner kicks they come up with their air force and it does make
it a little more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "But on the other hand, big players are usually a little slower,
so it works both ways. You've got to look at the negatives and
positives and try to mix it."</TE>
<TE>   Forward Brian McBride, who has scored against Portugal and Mexico
in this tournament, said the challenge facing the U.S. is formidable.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to be an easy task, we know that," he said
Wednesday. "We have to come prepared.</TE>
<TE>   "They're big, physical guys. We definitely have to make sure that
we have possession of the ball. Probably the biggest factor is going
to be making sure that they don't have time and space to serve balls.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a great team. They got here by playing good soccer, so I
don't think we're going to take any part of their game lightly."</TE>
<TE>   The battle probably will be won and lost in midfield, which should
be quite crowded because both teams favor a 3-5-2 formation.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is expected to field a starting lineup very similar to
the one that defeated Mexico, with two possible exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Lewis probably will lose his place in left midfield because
his main strength--the ability to cross the ball into the box--is
negated by the prowess of German goalkeeper Oliver Kahn and the
height and aerial strength of the German defensive trio of Christoph
Metzelder, Carsten Ramelow and Thomas Linke.</TE>
<TE>   That means DaMarcus Beasley will regain his spot. His speed and
dribbling ability are viewed as something that could unlock the
German defense, provided the diminutive Beasley is nimble enough to
avoid the crunching, lunging, scything tackles that will be aimed his
way.</TE>
<TE>   The other change probably will be made up front, where Clint
Mathis is expected to replace Josh Wolff.</TE>
<TE>   Mathis scored twice in a 4-2 loss to Germany in Rostock, Germany,
in March and has the incentive of once again wanting to catch the eye
of German club teams.</TE>
<TE>   The belief in the American camp is that Germany is vulnerable to
speed.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope so," Stewart said. "Pretty much they're big players, and
you hope, as a small player, to get around them."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. played Germany in the first round of the 1998 World Cup
in France and lost, 2-0, in Paris. The story of that game was the way
the Germans outmuscled the Americans, and the same could be true this
time.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is especially acute for the U.S. back line of Tony
Sanneh, Eddie Pope and, most likely, Gregg Berhalter, although Carlos
Llamosa is a possible starter. The chosen three somehow will have to
contain a German team that has only one starter under 6 feet, winger
Bernd Schneider, who is 5-10.</TE>
<TE>   Germany Coach Rudi Voeller has a quartet of powerful strikers to
turn loose against the U.S., with tournament co-leading scorer
Miroslav Klose and the 6-5 Carsten Jancker his most likely starters.
Voeller also can call Marco Bode and Oliver Bierhoff off the bench if
the first two fail.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Germans field Klose and Jancker, they're a handful in
front of the goal," Arena said. "Jancker is probably three or four
inches taller than Klose and a dangerous guy.</TE>
<TE>   "Klose has been outstanding. He's not as big, but his timing and
technique in front of the goal are excellent and that's a concern to
our defenders."</TE>
<TE>   Said McBride: "They play a brand of soccer that, when they're on,
they do what they did to the Saudis [an 8-0 victory in their first
game]. We've just got to make sure that we put them off their game."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart concurred.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a good team," he said. "They always say they're lucky,
but that's not luck anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Sanneh, who plays in Germany for FC Nuremberg, said the task
confronting the U.S. is not impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "I think to beat the Germans there are two ways you can do it," he
said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "One, you can keep the ball away from them, but they're physical
and they're going to get into you. If you start beating them, they're
going to foul you.</TE>
<TE>   "Or you have to be able to match up with them well physically. You
can't back down from them and you can't give them time. They used to
be faster and stronger than everybody, but now I think if you
pressure them you can put them in tight spots. They're not as good as
Mexico with the ball. They're not going to be able to pass it under
real pressure."</TE>
<TE>   All the same, Arena's idea still seems best. Just call the Lakers.</TE>

United States  vs. Germany
Friday, 4:30 a.m. PDT, at Ulsan, South Korea
TV: ESPN, Ch. 34. Delayed: Ch. 46, 2:30 p.m.; Ch. 7, Saturday, 10:30
a.m
How they got here: The U.S. finished second in Group D, then defeated
Mexico, 2-0, in the second round; Germany won Group E, then defeated
Paraguay, 1-0, in the second round
U.S. update: Coach Bruce Arena is worried about the Germans' size and
power. "We have to be good in a lot of areas to neutralize their
physical prowess," he said, noting that the Germans don't face the
same concern. "I don't think the German team is spending a whole lot
of time worrying about who we're putting on the field," he said. The
U.S. will be without three injured players, defenders Jeff Agoos and
Steve Cherundolo and forward Joe-Max Moore
Germany update: Coach Rudi Voeller has praised the Americans'
progress through the tournament. His assistant, Michael Skibbe, has
been less fearful of predicting victory. "I and the team are
convinced we are going to beat the U.S.," Skibbe said. "You have to
respect your opponent, but you also have to have confidence in
yourself." Germany is at full strength
Outlook: The countries have played each other six times, with Germany
holding a 4-2 edge and having outscored the U.S., 13-10. The only
American victories were in 1999, when they won, 3-0, in a friendly in
Jacksonville, Fla., and 2-0 in the FIFA Confederations Cup in Mexico
City. This time, however, Germany should win by two goals</TE>

<HD>Germany's Klose Wants a Goal for Walter</HD>

<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The co-leading goal scorer of the 2002 World Cup, Germany striker
Miroslav Klose, has an added incentive to do well against the United
States on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Klose said Wednesday that should he score against the U.S. he
would dedicate the goal to Fritz Walter, the captain of Germany's
1954 World Cup-winning team, who died Monday at his home in
Alsenborn, Germany, at age 81.</LD>
<LD>   Walter once played for Klose's current German Bundesliga club,
Kaiserslautern, leading it to two titles in the 1950s.</LD>
<TE>   "He was always happy when I scored a goal for Kaiserslautern,"
Klose said at Germany's base camp at Seogwipo on the island of Jeju,
South Korea. "He used to send me postcards and bottles of wine.</TE>
<TE>   "He followed my career and we talked a few times. He will never be
forgotten in our family. He will always be in my heart."</TE>
<TE>   Klose has scored five goals in the World Cup, all on headers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The German players will wear black armbands during Friday's
quarterfinal in memory of Walter. U.S. Coach Bruce Arena said the
loss of the national team's former captain could inspire Germany's
players.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the gentleman was a great figure in German soccer and
I think that's a great move of respect by the German team to
recognize him," he said. "Maybe it will make it more difficult for
us."</TE>
