<DH>THE BACKBONE OF THE WORLD: A Portrait of a Vanishing Way of
Life Along the Continental Divide By Frank Clifford Broadway: 276
pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICK BASS</AU>
<BD>Rick Bass is the author of 16 books of fiction and
nonfiction, including the forthcoming story collection "The Hermit's
Story."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I believe it's an unacknowledged phenomenon that landscape shapes
character, landscape shapes the individual, landscape shapes culture,
landscape shapes all, and I wonder often if, as we lose so many of
our various unique American landscapes, we are not also somehow
losing sections and segments of our spirit, our identity. I fear
increasingly that by the time we as a society make this connection,
it will be too late; we'll have lost those places and the collective
contribution they make to our culture and, somewhere, in that
vanishing, we will have become as tame and unimaginative and
disconnected as any other "developed" nation.</LD>
<TE>   As an editor and reporter with the Los Angeles Times for 20 years,
Frank Clifford has had occasion to cross paths with a number of such
places. In "The Backbone of the World: A Portrait of a Vanishing Way
of Life Along the Continental Divide," Clifford--the son of a gold
miner--states that it's his goal to capture and chronicle the tales
of the disappearing, "the ones who shot their own meat, who made a
living on horseback, who were still trying to adjust to the twentieth
century on the verge of the twenty-first." His vision and historical
awareness are admirable, for to rural residents of the West, it
sometimes seems that such individuals are still as common as pie. So
much are they a part of the West's culture and community that it's
almost inconceivable that their lives are, or will one day be, the
stuff of documentary, the mortar of history--much less, occasionally,
the stones, the essence, of history itself.</TE>
<TE>   For the individual in the West has never been very large and grows
tinier still. This is not so much the result of the onslaught of big
government and its regulations, many of which, truth be told, help
preserve these hanging-on cultures and the resources to which their
fates are wedded; think of the salmon fishermen reliant upon the
Endangered Species Act to protect their resource, the independent
loggers dependent upon a 30% tariff on Canadian lumber imports, the
rancher grazing his or her stock on federal lands at a fraction the
cost per animal unit that the so-called "free market" would bear.
Rather, it is big business, not government, that these last
shoot-your-own-meaters should most be fearing.</TE>
<TE>   Clifford has been motivated by the ambition to preserve vanishing
stories, if not the landscape that gave birth to such stories, and
that shaped such individuals. Starting at the southern end of the
United States, in Hachita, N.M., he sets out along the spine of the
Continental Divide, which divides the watersheds of the Atlantic and
Pacific oceans. To document the stories Clifford was looking for, he
knew it was past time. The population of Texas is now 85% urban. Less
than 5% of employment in the Rocky Mountain states is still in
farming, ranching and mining. "Wyoming might have a cowboy on its
license plate," writes Clifford, "but [by 1995] barely 3 percent of
its population made a living raising sheep and cows."</TE>
<TE>   The reporting found in "The Backbone of the World" is substantial
and of the most wonderful kind, with the numbers, dates and
statistics woven carefully into the stories. And the breadth of the
book--profiles of a variety of land-use practitioners from south to
north along the Continental Divide and the proposed Continental
Divide Trail--is considerable. Throughout the book, Clifford listens,
rather than talks, though occasionally his own perceptions and
reminiscences of landscape appear, particularly near the end of the
book, as if drawn out or even resurrected by both the experience and
the writing.</TE>
<TE>   Each essay has much to recommend it, though I find "The Bootheel"
particularly interesting in that it chronicles an area and history
that are largely underreported--the "bootheel" of New Mexico that
juts down into Mexico, with all of the attendant border disputes.
Here Clifford spends time with a family in Hidalgo County, where the
value of drugs seized will soon exceed the assessed valuation of all
personal property. The Bootheel's curious white history is due in
large part to U.S.-exiled Mormons who tried to settle in Chihuahua
but who were driven back into the U.S. by the Mexican government and
settled finally in this strange no man's land of shifting disputed
borders and very little water, and it's here that the proposed
Continental Divide Trail begins. There are some ranchers, Clifford
discovers, who would prefer cocaine and marijuana smugglers to
Lycra-clad recreationists.</TE>
<TE>   In another essay, "The Badger," Clifford spends time with members
of the Blackfoot tribe in northern Montana, where he attends an
annual summer powwow. Here he listens to tribal linguists "reacquaint
the Blackfeet with the language their grandparents spoke. It seems to
be a language grounded intensely in a specific, physical world--a
world of landscape," Clifford writes.</TE>
<TE>   In the last chapter, "Oh, Canada," Clifford writes: "Up here, the
Continental Divide becomes the great wall of the imagination, crowned
by crumbling domes and turrets as it zigzags its way north and
disappears into the clouds." Here, Clifford rides with pack horses
"along the roof of the Divide" with a local rancher and hunting
guide, Canadian Mike Judd, whom environmentalists call "a cowboy
Cassandra, a prophet of ecological ruin, ignored in his own country."
Judd's testimony helped protect a small part of the United States'
northern Rockies from oil and gas drilling in one of the most
spectacular landscapes this country has to offer; across the border,
there's even less protection than in the U.S. "Eventually, Canada's
inaction on the environment is bound to have repercussions," writes
Clifford.</TE>
<TE>   "'It'll affect you guys in the lower forty-eight,' Mike says to
me. 'Our wildlife is your wildlife. They don't stop at the border. A
lot of them--the bears and the wolves, mainly--come from up here. If
we stop growing them, you'll stop seeing them.'"</TE>
<TE>   In my opinion, it's stories like Judd's that capture this
time--the turn of the century--as accurately as any and that make
Clifford's book valuable in the moment, as well as into the future,
as history and documentary. All around the West, thoughtful rural
residents who once relied directly upon the land for their
livelihood--or who even still do, against the tide--are daring,
finally, to speak up in the quiet little rural communities where
there existed a 100-year shell of silence.</TE>
<TE>   Brave ranchers and loggers are finally putting their history
together--in a nutshell, 20 years of good times followed by 80 years
of betrayal, paucity and despair--and are using one of the last
things the West still has in plenty, imagination, to fashion
alliances with old perceived enemies, each side daring courageously
to listen to the other. It's not a movement yet--such conversations,
such courage, are still the exception. In the rural West, the burden
of such a cultural myth--cowboy good-environmentalist bad--seems
sometimes as dense as the reefs of old limestone that cap the Divide
itself. And yes, an old West is dying. The big businesses that
continue to work the public lands will see to that.</TE>
<TE>   Mining companies, for instance, purchasing public wild lands for
less than $5 an acre, under the archaic Mining Act of 1872 passed
before women and minorities could vote, despoil the mountains and
priceless water resources beneath these mountains, lacing the
aquifers with toxic metals before declaring bankruptcy, once the ore
is played out. They move on to another state, re-form as a new
company with the same players and attack another mountain.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the proposed Rock Creek mine in Montana's
Cabinet-Yaak ecosystem, Sterling Mining Co. plans to tunnel beneath
one of the nation's first 10 "flagship" wildernesses that Congress
ever protected. What deadly irony that the real jobs in the new West
are increasingly those of reclaiming Superfund sites--not that they
can be exploited again but so that they can be "merely" inhabited.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of this, as long as there is imagination, there can be
hope. Despair runs deep in both camps in "The Backbone of the
World"--so deep that it seems the divide that exists between them can
no longer be sustained and that surely, any century now, solutions
will be dreamed and forged. Clifford's book captures the tenor and
angst of the time, and the voices are reported and presented fairly,
even in their desperation. Our desperation.</TE>

<HD></HD>
<DH>POEMS TO READ A New Favorite Poem Anthology Edited by
Robert Pinsky  and Maggie Dietz W.W. Norton: 416 pp., $27.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL MUSKE-DUKES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Pinsky's tenure as U.S. poet laureate gave us an expanded
vision of the job. In the spirit of his predecessors Joseph Brodsky
and Robert Hass, (the former managed to slip volumes of poetry next
to Gideon Bibles in motel rooms and the latter raised consciousness
nationwide on literacy and the environment) Pinsky connected with a
(seemingly) poetry-indifferent public. His "Favorite Poem Project"
has proved that not only is the American public familiar with poetry,
but almost every one of us has a favorite poem held close to the
heart.</LD>
<LD>   Pinsky believes that poems are learned and best expressed in one's
own voice, that the body is the instrument by which the poem lives in
the world. His interest lies in enacting what is on the page--not in
yet another manifestation of "performance." How gratifying to know
that, in a dying literary culture, great poems are alive within our
memories, in our blood and bones. As a student of mine said, "Learn a
poem by heart and it is yours forever."</LD>
<TE>   Pinsky's first anthology in this tradition, "Americans' Favorite
Poems" (2000) featured poems printed with headers or comments by
readers who had found something in the poems to muse upon. Now we
have "Poems to Read," in which Pinsky and co-editor Maggie Dietz take
a more active role in the conversation. Here they've selected some of
the poems themselves, often adding their own thoughts and thereby
contextualizing the poems.</TE>
<TE>   This is a fresh take on the ever new pleasure of reading poems and
the alchemical process through which the poems speak to us as they
are spoken. Pinsky and Dietz's anthology is illuminating, energetic
and very American.</TE>

<TE>   MUSIC OF A DISTANT DRUM</TE>
<TE>   Classical Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Hebrew Poems</TE>
<TE>   Edited by Bernard Lewis</TE>
<TE>   Princeton University Press:</TE>
<TE>   224 pp., $19.95</TE>
<TE>   This anthology is a selection of poems representing the forms and
styles of Middle Eastern poetry from the 7th to the 18th century in
the four leading literary traditions of the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   In the introduction, editor Bernard Lewis (who speaks all four of
the languages of the poems) recounts an astonishing incident he
witnessed that provides insight into the role of the poet in Middle
Eastern culture. At a lunch given by the late King Hussein of Jordan
for tribal chiefs in a tent in the desert, the tribe's poet was
called upon to recite an ode (qasida) in praise of the king. The ode
was very long, written in literary Arabic, and the king sat with the
others, cross-legged on the floor, listening.</TE>
<TE>   When the poet finally paused, the king began to rise and offer
thanks. But the poet hadn't finished and cried out in colloquial
Arabic the equivalent of, "Hold it, OK? I'm not done yet." The king
obediently sat down again and allowed the poet to go on. As Lewis
asks, "Where else in the world would a poet feel free to address a
head of state in this way?" Where else would a poet be given such
estimable authority--except in (as these poems bear out) a culture
steeped in respect and love for poetry?</TE>
<TE>   These poems are revelatory: straightforward and yet filled with
longing and desire. A quote from an anonymous Persian poem:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I used to shun my companion</TE>
<TE>   if his religion was not like mine;</TE>
<TE>   But now my heart accepts every form ....</TE>
<TE>   Love alone is my religion, and whichever way</TE>
<TE>   its horses turn, that is my faith and creed.</TE>

<TE>   INVENTIONS OF FAREWELL</TE>
<TE>   A Book of Elegies</TE>
<TE>   Edited by Sandra M. Gilbert</TE>
<TE>   W.W. Norton: 478 pp., $25.95</TE>
<TE>   Poet and critic Sandra M. Gilbert's anthology of poetic responses
to loss, "Inventions of Farewell," is a moving selection of elegies
that chime against each other and seem to speak to one another in
their grief and tenderness. A quick moment from Countee Cullen's "A
Brown Girl Dead":</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With two white roses on her breasts,</TE>
<TE>   White candles at head and feet,</TE>
<TE>   Dark Madonna of the grave she rests;</TE>
<TE>   Lord Death has found her sweet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   These haunting poems span the centuries from the Middle Ages to
the present. The universality yet originality of Gilbert's selections
are remarkable. The individual, often deeply personal, expressions of
grief become an unforgettable chorus.</TE>

<DH>THE HAUNTING OF L. A Novel By Howard Norman Farrar, Straus
&amp; Giroux:  326 pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN LEVI</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Levi is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A large number of plane crashes, train wrecks and general acts of
destructive criminality punctuates Howard Norman's latest novel, "The
Haunting of L." But the central crime of the book is set on Sept. 11.
On that date, Peter Duvett, photographer's assistant, stumbles off an
airplane into the trading outpost of Churchill in Manitoba, Canada
and sleeps with his new employer's wife on her wedding night.</LD>
<LD>   That the novel opens exactly 75 years before the terrorist attacks
on the World Trade Center may be mere coincidence. But in Norman's
frozen Canada of 1926, manipulation is the weapon of choice and
coincidence is anything but mere. Time itself--as the inhabitants of
Churchill's sister city, that Peyton Place of the north, Twin Peaks,
Wash., once discovered--may be fluid.</LD>
<TE>   Things are certainly not what they seem. Duvett, a young,
dissatisfied Ishmael of photography, has quit a steady job in the
relatively bustling town of Halifax, Nova Scotia, to answer a
newspaper ad placed by Vienna Linn. After many years of traipsing
through the Old and New Worlds, Vienna has set himself up in
Churchill, a town of one hotel, one church, several hundred native
Canadian Indians and an airplane, to photograph the Eskimos recently
baptized by the eager Rev. Painter. Because Painter pays by the
photo, Vienna works around the clock and is in as desperate need of a
darkroom assistant as he is of ready cash.</TE>
<TE>   It is little surprise that a man of Vienna's talents--like many of
Churchill's non-Eskimo inhabitants--is concealing a dirty secret that
explains his presence in the wilderness. Years before, he made a
Faustian pact with a rich London businessman named Radin Heur (Norman
is a baroque baptist himself). Heur pays Vienna spectacularly well to
add to his collection of photographs of spectacular tragedy--train
derailments, car collisions and their aftermaths--that occasionally
require the photographer to manipulate events so that some accidents
are not so accidental. A botched train wreck and an inability to
repay his advance have sent Vienna on the run from the evil Heur to
Churchill and a darkened pantry closet where he can restock his
coffers by developing the portraits of newly saved Eskimos.</TE>
<TE>   But it is the developments outside the darkroom that most entangle
young Duvett. Vienna's new wife, the exquisite redhead Kala Murie,
draws Duvett not only into her adulterous arms but into her own
passionate obsession for a very special branch of photography: spirit
photography.</TE>
<TE>   Across Canada, and now exclusively to the good people of
Churchill, Murie delivers lectures on the subject to both the
skeptical and the desperate. She is a disciple of Miss Georgiana
Houghton, whose 1882 book, "The Unclad Spirit," describes the spirit
photograph as an ordinary picture of a wedding, family reunion or
baptism, into which an "uninvited guest," usually a dead friend or
relation, insinuates himself in shadowy relief. "No one actually sees
or speaks to this person," recounts Duvett, "the person isn't even
vaguely recalled. Yet when the official photograph of the event is
developed, there he is, or there she is--the uninvited guest."</TE>
<TE>   Are spirit photographs real or are they fraudulent? Clearly,
photography and verisimilitude are easily confused and just as
clearly, photography preys upon the wishes of the hopeful.</TE>
<TE>   Duvett, whose proudest talent is an ability to write captions,
understands that despite the apparent clarity of the photograph, it
still needs a little help to focus the understanding of the observer.
His proudest caption explains the shadowy smudges on Vienna's most
daring photograph: "Esquimaux Souls Risen From Aeroplane Wreck." It
leaves unspoken, however, the reasons why Vienna happened to have his
tripod and camera at the dawn take-off and, more significantly, why
his beloved Murie happened to be a passenger on that plane. And yet,
the silence of these mysteries is not the pause following the organ
sting of an early radio melodrama or a slow-mo David Lynch climax
before the commercial.</TE>
<TE>   It allows the reader's mind to rise through time up to the present
day to wonder whether Norman's yarn is a cautionary tale, a
commentary on the skepticism of the millions of people who fail to
accept the evidence of images and the veracity of captions, who
wonder how accidental the presence of any photographer may be. If so,
it is a parable writ with a delicate hand.</TE>
<TE>   Duvett tells his story with the unadorned voice of the heroes of
Norman's other excellent Canadian tales, "The Bird Artist" and "The
Museum Guard." It is a voice of simplicity but assurance that knows
that the caption below the photo is only the hook and that the real
drama of the tale will appear through the skills of a master
developer. There are some mysteries that may never be solved.</TE>

<DH>SELECTED ESSAYS By John Berger Edited by Geoff Dyer
Pantheon: 588 pp., $35 *  THE SHAPE OF A POCKET By John Berger
Pantheon: 266 pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSIE LINFIELD</AU>
<BD>Susie Linfield is a contributing writer to Book Review
and teaches in the Cultural Reporting and Criticism program at New
York University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here is an irony: In 1972 John Berger, one of England's most
influential art critics, created a show for the BBC called "Ways of
Seeing." It was a phenomenal success. Meant as a corrective to the
genteel great-man theory of art history (think Kenneth Clark's
"Civilisation"), the show introduced the then-radical but now widely
accepted idea that our very vision of the world, and our modes of
making art, are expressions not just of personality but of power,
class and history.</LD>
<LD>   Not surprisingly, the show and its accompanying book spawned two
generations of highly politicized art critics. And here is where the
irony enters. For the contemporary criticism--didactic, petulant and
often entirely incomprehensible--that Berger's show and books have
fostered is the antithesis of his own lucid style and passionately
humane substance. Indeed, the difference between Berger and his
postmodern children is like that between the Paris Commune and Pol
Pot's Cambodia. Something was lost in translation.</LD>
<TE>   Berger, 75, has had a remarkably prolific career. In addition to
his many works of art criticism, he is also a painter, poet,
dramatist and screenwriter (most notably of "Jonah Who Will Be 25 in
the Year 2000"). He's a successful fiction writer too: His 1972 novel
"G" won the Booker Prize. (A lifelong Marxist, Berger gave half his
prize money to a British branch of the Black Panthers.) Born and
raised in London, he has lived for decades as a "voluntary exile" in
a tiny peasant village in the French Alps.</TE>
<TE>   The book jacket of "Selected Essays" suggests something of
Berger's trajectory. On the front is a large photograph of the author
as a young man: handsome, certainly, with a strikingly direct gaze
but appearing somewhat startled, as if he is not exactly at home in
the world. On the back is an equally large photo of Berger today:
still handsome, certainly, but weathered, with a wrinkled forehead,
deep bags under his eyes, furrowed brows and a head of tousled white
hair. He is squinting, with an expression that implies a wound beyond
bewilderment--as if he can't quite believe, much less comprehend,
what he is seeing but that he must. Berger doesn't look like a man
who's lived an easy life. But he looks as though he's lived an
intensely engaged one.</TE>
<TE>   In Berger's essays, one thing naturally leads to another; as with
George Orwell (who was, fittingly, one of Berger's first editors),
the connections are wonderfully surprising and almost never forced.
Meaning unfolds from within. A consideration of 18th century
caricatures inspires an analysis of the culture of celebrity, which
Berger rightly sees as the antithesis of democracy; a revisit to the
Grunewald Altarpiece makes him ponder the left's defeats in 1968 and
the ways in which experience alters perception.</TE>
<TE>   Thinking about commodities, he begins thinking about food, which
leads to a class analysis of dinner. He's interested in the
differences between film, painting and literature. He refers often to
sexual passion (he seems to have loved deeply if not, of course,
without difficulty). He writes about apes, stones and beds. His ideas
about photography, along with those of Roland Barthes and Susan
Sontag, revolutionized our critical understanding of that medium.
Recently, he has been corresponding with Subcomandante Marcos, the
Mexican revolutionary (some of these pieces are included in "The
Shape of a Pocket"). The wide range of Berger's interests and the
unabashed curiosity with which he pursues them suggest what a free
and fearless person might be like.</TE>
<TE>   For the last quarter-century, art criticism has been obsessed with
"the gaze"--the ways in which the artist's regard of his subject
supposedly reproduces inequalities of race, class or sex. Vision
itself--which is always partial and imperfect (unless you are
God)--has been indicted as an agent of oppression. In contrast,
Berger likes to look. Indeed, he is fascinated, and moved, by the
activity of looking, which he considers a key to our humanity. For
Berger, seeing the world is the beginning of understanding it,
engaging it and changing it.</TE>
<TE>   And more: His work reminds us that vision is a requisite of love.
Here, from "Selected Essays," is his description of a nude by Frans
Hals: "He painted her breasts as if they were entire faces.... One of
her knees is painted as if it revealed as much about her reactions as
her chin. The result is disconcerting because ... most nudes are as
innocent of experience as aims unachieved. And disconcerting ...
because of the painter's total concentration on painting her--her,
nobody else and no fantasy of her."</TE>
<TE>   For Berger, a painting is a process rather than a thing. Every
painting tells a story: of the artist's moving toward and grappling
with his subject. (And this is true irrespective of the work's
content and of whether it is representational or abstract.) A
painting of an apple does not show us an apple but an apple in the
act of being seen. And no painting is ever finished, for we viewers
remake the work of art when we approach it; the story continues. In
Berger's world, looking at art may be restorative, but it is never
passive; the viewer is a participant, not a sponge. Berger's work,
more than that of any contemporary, reminds us that dialectics is a
philosophy of motion, of fluidity, of connection and change; it
breathes and lives so that we can too.</TE>
<TE>   Though art is determined in part by historic circumstances, it is
also "a potential model of freedom," Berger insists. Ideology can
never explain "the energy flowing through the current. And it is with
this energy that the spectator identifies." (A radical work of art
doesn't tell us what to think; it nurtures our capacity to do so.) He
views all dogmas--of left and right--as attempts to suffocate the
spontaneity of lived reality. And realism is Berger's prime value. Of
Gustave Courbet he observes, with admiration, "One does not just feel
that every scene he painted looked like that but that it was known
like that."</TE>
<TE>   But this realism, it must quickly be added, has no connection to
naturalism, mimicry or literalism. In art, it can encompass the
expressionism of Van Gogh and the abstraction of Rothko as easily as
the crystalline representation of Vermeer. In literature, it would
welcome the turbulent lyricism of William Faulkner, James Agee and
James Joyce.</TE>
<TE>   Such realism is not a style but a stance: a way of understanding
one's existence as intimately enmeshed with what Berger calls "the
production of the world." It is based on respect for the
things--including the histories, individual and collective--that we
make. This is the realism, I would argue, of Orwell, who believed
that all lies, regardless of context or intent, are
counterrevolutionary; of Martin Buber, who understood love not as a
private emotion but as a mutual relation; of Primo Levi, who
discovered beauty, and an ethic, in the periodic table; of Hannah
Arendt, who preferred limited man-made rights to infinite "natural"
ones.</TE>
<TE>   Realism is an embrace of the world as it is and as it could be; it
can encompass hopes but not illusions, tragedy (which reveals us to
ourselves) but not sentimentality (whose aim, always, is to
obfuscate). It is creative. It is an exploration and an invitation.
It is not heroic, but it requires alertness. It values reason while
honoring mystery. It seeks truth not because the truth is happy but
because it is the only path to knowledge. Realism is the basis of all
principled politics and all good art. Its starting point is the
absolute acceptance--without self-pity, resentment or grandiosity--of
mortality. It presents the possibility of courage. The opposite of
realism is not imagination but evasion and bad faith.</TE>
<TE>   We live in a time of fuzzy thinking: Attitude substitutes for
politics, newness is conflated with modernity, precision itself is
suspect and mistaken, oddly, for constraint. Berger's work
reestablishes crucial distinctions: between skepticism and cynicism,
flexibility and moral relativism, conviction and rigidity, humility
and despair.</TE>
<TE>   He is very angry about the ways in which we defile one another and
the world: He is one of those rare people who hears the screams. But
he hears the music too. Tenderness, and an unflagging interest in the
experience of being human, infuse his work. He once described Goya as
honest "in the full sense of the word meaning facing the facts and
preserving one's ideals." What is true for the artist is true for the
critic too.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `The Shape of a Pocket'</TE>
<TE>   More and more people go to museums to look at paintings and do not
come away disappointed. What fascinates them? To answer: Art, or the
history of art, or art appreciation, misses, I believe, the
essential.</TE>
<TE>   In art museums we come upon the visible of other periods and it
offers us company. We feel less alone in face of what we ourselves
see each day appearing and disappearing. So much continues to look
the same: teeth, hands, the sun, women's legs, fish ... in the realm
of the visible all epochs coexist and are fraternal, whether
separated by centuries or millennia. And when the painted image is
not a copy but the result of a dialogue, the painted thing speaks if
we listen.</TE>

<DH>THE DILIGENT A Voyage Through the Worlds of the Slave Trade
By Robert Harms Basic Books: 466 pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN BLACKBURN</AU>
<BD>Robin Blackburn teaches history at the New School
University in New York and is the author of "The Making of New World
Slavery."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Atlantic trade in slaves and slave produce in the 18th century is
sometimes wrongly associated with the state-organized world of
colonial mercantilism rather than with the birth of free trade. The
Spanish trade in silver did furnish the basis for a well-organized
colonial system. In the early days, royal monopolies played some role
in the slave traffic but, before long, "interlopers" proved better
able to supply the planters with the captive labor force they craved
and Europe with the sugar, tobacco and coffee of the plantations.</LD>
<LD>   The Diligent was a vessel engaged for slave-trading purposes by
two French interlopers, the Billy brothers of Vannes. As an
independent venture, it illustrates the waning ability of the
chartered slave-trading companies to engross the traffic. The Billy
brothers were grain merchants who aimed to break into a profitable
traffic, one that had already been sanctioned by royal authorities
and, on the grounds that it would foster conversion, even by the
church.</LD>
<TE>   Robert Harms' account of the voyage is based on the journal of a
French mariner, Robert Durand, who took part as first lieutenant
aboard the Diligent's first voyage in 1731-32. There are scores of
firsthand narratives of slave trading voyages, and Durand's is not
particularly vivid. Yet, in the hands of Harms, the laconic entries,
the evocative drawings and the records of a court case brought
against the captain by the ship's owners furnish a compelling and
illuminating narrative.</TE>
<TE>   Harms supplies a context to the voyage and supplements journal
entries that carry the story forward and help to explain the workings
of the largest and most sustained forced migration in history. The
result is an indispensable work of history. Yale University had asked
Harms to assess the authenticity of Durand's manuscript. Not only was
it genuine but it also concerned a major branch of the slave traffic
and many of the issues that it poses. The author's ability to bring
out the significance of the story stems, however, from his impressive
command of the trade's Atlantic history and skill at opening up the
narrative.</TE>
<TE>   None of those directly concerned in this expedition recorded any
qualm or doubt. Yet, as Harms explains, the status of slaves in
France had recently been tested by Pauline Villeneuve, a young woman
who had been taken as a slave servant from the French West Indies by
her mistress, then left in a convent in Nantes. Before her mistress
could reclaim her, Villeneuve requested acceptance in the order. The
nuns and abbot helped her to win the subsequent court case, arguing
that though slavery was legal in the colonies, it was incompatible
with the free air of France. Freedom suits set limits to the system
but didn't give pause to the planters or slave traders.</TE>
<TE>   The Diligent arrived on the West African coast at a time when King
Agaja of the kingdom of Dahomey was establishing control of the major
slave trading outlets at Whydah and Jakin. The European forts there
offered scant protection, so the traders are shown as supplicants,
dependent on the favor of intermediaries and monarchs.</TE>
<TE>   Agaja had an English slave, Bullfinche Lambe, whom he had acquired
as a captive from another ruler and refused to ransom. Agaja is
sometimes seen as an opponent of the slave trade because the effect
of his military moves was to interrupt the traffic from Whydah,
source of more than half of all the captives carried from West
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   From Harms' account, it seems that Agaja was attempting to cut out
mercantile middlemen and had framed the plan of establishing sugar
plantations in Dahomey. He sent Lambe with a letter to the English
king proposing that the Royal Africa Co. join him in setting up
plantations and marketing their produce in Europe. The British
authorities declined but sought to remain on good terms with the
increasingly powerful monarch.</TE>
<TE>   The power behind the throne of Whydah, we learn, was an African
commander known as Captain Assou, who successfully imposed a peace
agreement on the European forts and traders based in this coastal
state. According to this agreement, the Europeans were bound to
remain at peace with one another on the African coast at all times.
The African rulers were also loath to award special privileges to
particular nations or companies. John Konny, the African ruler of
Fort Friederichsburg, wished his territory to be a "free port where
all nations could trade." The activities of Assou and Agaja showed
that free commerce, especially a commerce in captives, required good
order and mutual trust. Once they fell out, the trade suffered.</TE>
<TE>   Harms' account shows Africans not simply as victims but also as
protagonists of the drama. But the responsibility for what befell the
captives once they left Africa lies with the Europeans. At the book's
outset, Harms made clear that the impulse to trade slaves was rooted
in Europe's consuming passion for exotic plantation goods. Thus Harms
supplies a vignette of adventurer John Law's famous attempt to
reorganize French finances on the basis of a colonial monopoly. The
failure of Law's system was one more proof that pure monopoly did not
work. Around this time Legendre, a financier, coined the term
"laissez faire" in pleading with authorities to relax the colonial
system.</TE>
<TE>   The Diligent with difficulty purchased 256 slaves and lost nine in
the course of the "middle passage"--slave deaths were usually much
higher. But because of high prices paid on the African coast and low
prices received in Martinique at a time of commercial depression, the
voyage did not make money for its backers. Harms mentions another
voyage involving Durand that made a profit despite eventual loss of
the vessel. Slave traffic was highly competitive. To be sure of a
profit, a merchant needed to spread his investment over many voyages,
a circumstance favoring the larger traders.</TE>
<TE>   Harms has no difficulty establishing the atrocious conditions
facing the captives, and Durand sparely records a signal act of
resistance on board the Diligent leading to a bloody and ceremonial
execution. Harms also mentions several shipboard uprisings that might
have been known to Durand, all of which were suppressed with great
ferocity. He cautiously speculates about the captives' fears and
hopes but there is little to go on. And because of the matter-of-fact
nature of Durand's journal, little is known of the inner life even of
the protagonist.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the book successfully transports us to another epoch with
assumptions we find, by turns, strange and familiar as the ancient
institution of human bondage is refashioned to serve modern-seeming
entrepreneurs responding to modern-seeming consumers. Harms is not
the first to convey the cruelty of the slave traffic, but his vivid
re-creation of this period is a remarkable achievement. By all means,
read Barry Unsworth's well-researched novel "Sacred Hunger" or Hugh
Thomas' compendious history "The Slave Trade." But for a sense of
what the trade involved and how it was made possible, Harms' story is
unrivaled.</TE>

<TE>   The air was dank and stifling hot because the refashioned cargo
bay of the Diligent had not been built with ventilation in mind.
After the women had all been loaded, the men were loaded onto the
front part of the slave deck and shackled together two by two. The
slave irons carried by the Diligent, which had been manufactured in
Nantes, consisted of two U-shaped bars of iron held together by an
iron rod that was passed through openings on the ends and locked into
place. The slave iron bound the left ankle of one captive to the
right ankle of another, making it difficult for either of them to
walk unless they moved in perfect harmony. As their eyes grew
accustomed to the semidarkness, they began to look around for
comrades from the warehouse who had gone out before them.</TE>

<HD>Dreaming of India</HD>
<DH>VIDEO Stories By Meera Nair Pantheon: 196 pp., $21.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARINA BUDHOS</AU>
<BD>Marina Budhos is the author of two novels, "House of
Waiting" and "The Professor of Light," and a nonfiction book, "Remix:
Conversations with Immigrant Teenagers." She has been a Fulbright
scholar to India.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Video," a group of 10 stories by a new Indian writer, Meera Nair,
had a little sizzle of celebrity a while back: The title story won
the first PEN/Amazon.com short-story contest for unpublished writers
in 2000 but was subsequently disqualified because another of her
stories had been published in the Threepenny Review. The matter was
deemed a "good-faith misunderstanding" by the contest sponsors, but
somehow that tiny moment of Internet scandal, at the height of the
dot-com boom, fixed the work in my mind as new, edgy and
cinematic--perhaps the next exciting direction that Indian fiction
would take.</LD>
<LD>   In her first collection, Nair has chosen to make use of the simple
folk-tale form to take a sly look at modern India with all its
juxtapositions. These are miniatures, in which videos and porn jostle
traditional extended families; in which political events are seen
through the eyes of ordinary villagers and where Valentine's Day,
which traditionalists paint as Western and corrupting of Indian
marriage values, provokes a storm of emotion in an irascible elderly
man.</LD>
<TE>   This literary mixture is promising and is what we've come to
expect in Indian fiction, ever since Salman Rushdie's "Midnight's
Children" gave us a new grammar for India's simultaneous
post-colonial, postmodern existence. Nair's techniques remind me of
Shahzia Sikander, a young Pakistan-born artist who interposes
contemporary pop images on fine miniature paintings.</TE>
<TE>   There are real pleasures to this collection. The writing is juicy;
the details lovely, luscious bits of description that waft pungently
from the Subcontinent with true Indian-style density: a man who has a
superhuman nose and can smell "the tight whirls of sharp, bright
coriander wrapped into the pungent flare of pepper surrounded by the
expanding corona of garlic"; a Goan fisherman who becomes legendary
for crafting beautiful figures out of sand and who inspires in the
local women "womb-tickling churnings" until the men grow jealous and
rumors grow "ugly green wings and talons and flew around the village
faster."</TE>
<TE>   There are also touching moments when one realizes the jostling
reality that Nair depicts: Dilip Alva of "The Curry Leaf Tree" grows
up as the son of a cook, living in a "dim universe" of "perfect disks
filled with red chilli powder, yellow turmeric, coriander leaves"; he
grows up to become a software engineer and lands in America, where
he's so changed his station in life that he can marry a contemptuous,
fair-skinned woman from India who had never learned how to cook
because she always had servants. These dizzying social
trajectories--so much the story of Indians today--are slyly and
beautifully captured.</TE>
<TE>   But for all the commotion and disruption in these characters'
lives, the stories have a curiously controlled, static feel; we're
too aware of their design as we move down their tightly prescribed
grooves. Too often I could feel the inexorable gears moving toward a
logical end. Only the title story gave me that jolt of surprise, when
a porn video leads to an interesting power shift in a traditional
marriage and the wife mysteriously retreats to--of all places--an
outhouse. Here Nair brilliantly exposes the underside to all this
peculiar modernization: Naseer, the husband, feels as if "[h]is life
was in shambles; there were objects collapsing inside him, shivering
apart like a dilapidated house struck by a cannonball, and they were
watching TV."</TE>
<TE>   In many of the other stories, however, the hand of the author is
less inventive. In "My Grandfather Dreams of Fences," the instant we
learn the story is about an upper-caste landowner who is protesting
the loss of a foot of land to a low-caste farmhand, we know where
this is going: The proud, old world grandfather will lose his
territory and live out his days among his rotting coconut trees that
no one will pick.</TE>
<TE>   The stories that are pinned to actual events are the weakest, for
there's little organic meshing of the two parts. "A Warm Welcome to
the President, Insh'Allah!" is based on the imagined response of a
Bangladeshi village that President Clinton was supposed to visit on a
south Asia trip: No surprise, they get all worked up, and he doesn't
show. The villagers' shenanigans and squabbles don't really add up to
anything more than what we've read in the news.</TE>
<TE>   These stories with their hodgepodge blend of folklore and
contemporary scenarios suggest explosive change and tumult, and yet
they are constructed with a prescribed, fateful order. Imaginative
premises become tidy conceits that are too tightly bound and
inevitable in their unfurling. Nair shows obvious gifts as a new
writer. I just wish she would trust her eruptive talent, take a risk
and toss aside the tight miniature and let her characters fly into
the cosmos and land where they might.</TE>

<HD>A Day at the Races</HD>
<DH>HORSE OF A DIFFERENT COLOR A Tale of Breeding Geniuses,
Dominant Females, and the Fastest Derby Winner Since Secretariat By
Jim Squires PublicAffairs: 302 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN CONLEY</AU>
<BD>Kevin Conley is the author of "Stud: Adventures in
Breeding." He is a staff writer at the New Yorker.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In last year's Kentucky Derby, Monarchos, a beautiful gray colt,
passed eight horses on the turn and won the Super Bowl of horse
racing by four lengths and change, nearly breaking Secretariat's
Derby record in the process. The track was fast that day--winners in
races earlier that afternoon had set three track records--a condition
that supposedly suited the favorite, Point Given, who finished an
inexplicably listless fifth. In the months that followed, Point Given
recovered, recording emphatic wins in the Preakness, the Belmont and
three more million-dollar races after that. But often in interviews
following those wins, his trainer, Bob Baffert, appeared to be less
elated by the victories than haunted by the one great loss. "Nobody
ever asks you," Baffert said, "if you won the Preakness."</LD>
<TE>   Jim Squires, a former editor of the Chicago Tribune, bred
Monarchos--that is, he shelled out $14,000 to buy Regal Band, a
9-year-old mare (the author admits that he'd "always been attracted
to older females"), and he chose the bargain sire he wanted to breed
her to: Maria's Mon, whose services at stud cost $7,500 at the time.
Squires watched the act of conception at a farm 10 miles from his own
Lexington, Ky., spread, and 11 months later, on a mild February
night, he foaled the future Derby winner. Three years after that, he
was standing in the valet parking line at Gulfstream Park moments
after Monarchos won the Florida Derby, an important Kentucky Derby
prep race, when the former governor of Kentucky, Brereton C. Jones,
offered him $600,000 for the mare and the foal with which she was
then pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't you dare sell him that mare for that," Jones' wife said to
Squires' wife. "She's worth a million and he knows it."</TE>
<TE>   Squires proudly chronicles his trek from bargain breeding to
clubhouse banter with big-money Bluegrass insiders with partisan
malevolence and in parental detail. Before Squires' book, a tell-all
was the last thing you'd expect to get from the breeder of a Derby
winner. As a rule, Kentucky "hardboots," the bluebloods of the
breeding business, barely speak to the press. But Squires' memoir
offers the best of both worlds: His book is brimming with the sort of
juicy bits of gossip and recreational character assassination that
come naturally to the off-duty newspaperman and, at the same time,
it's full of salty bits of breeding wisdom, crisp rundowns of the
Machiavellian financial maneuvering in the blood-stock business and
canny explanations of the Kentucky frame of mind from a bluegrass
insider.</TE>
<TE>   He's particularly good on the bitterness that the many Kentucky
horsemen felt in 2000, when Fusao Sekiguchi, the Japanese owner of
Fusaichi Pegasus, arrived in the winner's circle at Churchill Downs
in "gangster pinstripes" with a "bevy of fancy geishas" and had to
"accept the magnificent Kentucky Derby winner's trophy through an
interpreter."</TE>
<TE>   The book is a romp and, like Monarchos, it picks up steam as it
nears the finish line. Even though you know the outcome from the
title, you can't stop rushing ahead to see how it turns out. Along
the way, Squires can exaggerate his outsider status--about half the
people in the horse world came into it just the way he did, with a
big wad of cash (his came from a hefty severance package from the
Tribune.) But you soon come to see it his way; if he overplays his
own blue-collar, man-of-the-earth qualities, it's only because he's
identifying so strongly with his knock-around horses. And he's at his
best when he tweaks the famous, as when he reports insults he
overheard about Monarchos' trainer, John Ward. One unnamed source
said that Ward couldn't train a vine to go up a wall. Another said
that Ward couldn't train his own hair to lie down.</TE>
<TE>   But Squires has made a couple of decisions that tend to drive the
reader batty. He narrates the book in the third person ("Finally, it
dawned on him why he had been so completely seduced by the photos of
women and horses. Of course, why not? He was 55 years old and had
spent every dime he'd ever made on one or the other.") and he's prone
to a smug brand of folksiness. Throughout the book, he refers to his
wife as the "dominant female" and himself, in supposed self-mockery,
as the "breeding genius." When they fly south for the Florida Derby,
he self-deprecatingly dubs the couple the "Kenturkeys." He also
overindulges in long-outdated men's club-style jollity. Here is
Squires on his encounter with the female horse trader who bought the
young Monarchos from him: "Besides having a wonderful eye for the
horse, Murray Smith owns the world's most impressive pair of blue
jeans, which she frequently wears on shopping trips and into which
she had been poured that March day. The jeans have a way of
dominating any barn, sale pavilion or pasture in which they appear."</TE>
<TE>   Such an attitude is not hard to find in horse country, where it
might even be considered charming or chivalrous with the right accent
and the right bourbon. And while most Kenturkeys who share the
author's sensibility would probably not go to press with it, it is
authentic.</TE>
<TE>   Readers have to set their own tolerance levels. Horse lovers tend
to be a forgiving lot if someone has the goods. And last year, on the
first Saturday of May, Squires and the rest of the Monarchos crowd
had the goods. Derby winners speak the Thoroughbred gospel for at
least a year, and Squires' book is full of insider observations. He
is one of the few people on Earth who could write firsthand of the
moment that every horse owner hopes to experience--the birth of a
Derby horse:</TE>
<TE>   "[W]hen Regal Band extended her front legs to raise herself, her
newborn was somehow in a position to do the same. As she rose, so did
the foal; the mother in the slowly leveraged way of a practiced
horse, the baby in one quick jump. Snap! Pop! There it was on its
feet, trembling from one end to the other, in a perfect four-square
brace.</TE>
<TE>   "'Well, I'll be damned,' said the owner. 'I've been foaling horses
for fifteen years and I never saw a baby get up with his mother
before in my life.'</TE>
<TE>   "Sigita [the farm manager] smiled. 'Athlete,' she said, lifting
the tail end for a gender check."</TE>

<DH>EXCELSIOR! The Amazing Life of Stan Lee By Stan Lee and
George Mair Fireside Books:  255 pp., $14 paper * COMIC WARS How Two
Tycoons Battled Over the Marvel Comics Empire--And Both Lost By Dan
Raviv Broadway Books: 320 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC FLORES</AU>
<BD>Marc Flores is the author of the forthcoming "Tales to
Astonish: Two Men, Fifty Superheros and the Transformation of
American Pop Culture."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanley Martin Lieber was a nonconformist who dreamed of writing the
Great American Novel but settled for comic books that paid the rent
and were signed "Stan Lee." Although many of his peers simplified
their language and themes for young readers, Lee, a voracious reader
of H.G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, Mark Twain, Shakespeare and the
Bible, turned his comic book stories into modern-day equivalents of
English morality plays, Greek tragedies and simple melodramas.</LD>
<LD>   With epic simplicity and an innate sense of justice, Lee
maintained the conventions of the superhero genre--bad guys receiving
their comeuppance in a mere 22 pages, heroes wearing gym shorts over
their pants--but Lee's world was a little more complex. Victories
were pyrrhic, characters died and the next tragedy was always on its
way.</LD>
<LD>   With Spider-Man, arguably the most inspired comic creation since
Superman, Lee turned the concept of the superhero inside out.
Spider-Man was neurotic, skeptical and constantly struggling with his
own insecurities (whether he enjoyed his powers too much, whether he
really was the menace described in newspaper editorials). He lost
more battles than he won and occasionally, tragically, failed to save
the lives of those closest to him.</LD>
<TE>   It was a formula--Spidey trading insults and punches with such
middle-aged super villains as the Vulture, Dr. Octopus, the Green
Goblin and Electro--that was phenomenally successful and its history
is colorfully laid out in Lee and George Mair's "Excelsior! The
Amazing Life of Stan Lee," "Excelsior!" being his column's trademark
signoff. Mixing anecdote with description, the authors tells us how
Lee helped introduce Marvel Comic's most enduring properties. They
shares stories of Lee's early days at the comic book giant; his stint
in the military during World War II; the death of his infant
daughter, Jan; and his battles with censors. It is a life as full of
grit, determination and triumph as the adventures of his most
illustrious creation, which hits the big screen this week.</TE>
<TE>   Superman and Batman have had their day, and now it's Spider-Man's
turn. With the promotional push well underway--soundtrack music
included in videos on MTV, commercials airing regularly, the
web-covered character's face on boxes for breakfast cereals--longtime
fans and filmgoers will finally have a chance to see director Sam
Raimi's extraordinary computer-generated graphic footage of the
web-slinging, high-marketed hero.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, Spider-Man had proved to be Marvel's most
film-friendly property. Shortly after opening its doors in 1939,
Marvel Comics began a quick roller coaster ride in the capricious
world of comic book publishing. After enjoying quick success with
heroes like Captain America and Human Torch and with stories tied to
World War II, the company found itself on the brink in the 1950s,
when interest in superheroes waned and a congressional subcommittee
sought to censor the sensationalized multi-paneled comic book world.
The company survived by publishing everything from westerns to
romance and sci-fi monster comics. Sales were modest and Marvel
survived by publishing reprints of old material, in titles
distributed by chief rival DC Comics.</TE>
<TE>   Such a hardscrabble life was not entirely alien to Lee.
Particularly moving, however, are his descriptions in "Excelsior!" of
his parents' attempts to keep the family afloat during the Great
Depression. "They must have loved each other when they were married,
but my earliest recollections were of the two of them arguing,
quarreling incessantly," Lee writes. "Almost always it was over
money, or the lack of it. I realized at an early age how the specter
of poverty, the never-ending worry about not having enough money to
buy groceries or to pay the rent, could cast a cloud over a marriage.
I'll always regret the fact that, by the time I was earning enough
money to make things easier for them, it was too late."</TE>
<TE>   In 1961, however, Marvel publisher Martin Goodman asked his
cousin-in-law, Marvel editor Lee, to create a knockoff of DC's
best-selling Justice League of America, a consortium that united DC's
top-selling characters. Lee and Marvel artist Jack Kirby created the
Fantastic Four and began a historic collaboration that resulted in
the creation of what Lee called "the Marvel Universe." By 1966,
Hollywood came calling.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1970s, Lee brokered film and television deals and, by
1978, CBS television aired a live-action series based on Spider-Man
and pilots for series about Dr. Strange and Captain America. During
the 1980s, ABC aired the Spider-Woman cartoon and NBC offered yet
another Fantastic Four animated series. The 1990s saw Marvel option
more of its 4,700 characters to film and television producers and, in
1991, new owner Ronald Perelman (who purchased the company from New
World) take Marvel public. Under Perelman, Marvel comics expanded
into animation (Marvel Studios' critically acclaimed incarnations of
Spider-Man and the X-Men), licensing (best-selling video games), toys
(through Toy Biz, which ultimately came to control the company),
comic book publishing and the Marvel.com Web site, which offers
"Dotcomics" for download.</TE>
<TE>   "Excelsior!" also describes how the plain-spoken charismatic
writer--in tandem with the late artist Kirby--created the world's
most recognizable heroes, including the X-Men, the Incredible Hulk
and the Silver Surfer, and moved superheroes into film, television
and the corporate boardroom. Lee doesn't describe his legendary
battles with Kirby, nor does he offer more than passing references to
Marvel's most recent descent into bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   For this story, turn to Dan Raviv's "Comic Wars: How Two Tycoons
Battled Over the Marvel Comics Empire--and Both Lost." Raviv, a CBS
correspondent and author of "Every Spy a Prince," recounts how
Perelman led the company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy (laying off
hundreds in the process) during the 1990s, then battled Carl Icahn in
court until businessmen Ike Perlmutter and Avi Arad of Toy Biz took
control. Raviv's descriptions of expletive-scattered boardroom
tirades, the obligatory Perelman divorce drama, interviews with
insiders and all the courtroom documents might make for a movie of
its own, but they unfortunately add up to a long-winded retread of
"Barbarians at the Gate."</TE>
<TE>   Raviv offers top-notch reporting and skillful and engaging
writing, but they are not enough to relieve the venom and vitriol
that take us far from the otherworldliness of the comic books that
may have provided an ironic backdrop for these corporate skirmishes.
Where is Spider-Man when we need him most?</TE>
<TE>   All the more reason to enjoy the triumph of "Excelsior!" as Lee
takes readers back to the time when Marvel Comics were half as
expensive, their audience was twice as large, every month brought up
to five incredible Stan Lee stories in various comic series and the
world was a better place for it.</TE>

<DH>MASTER OF THE SENATE By Robert A. Caro Alfred A. Knopf:
1,172 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS GOULD</AU>
<BD>Lewis Gould is the author of numerous books, including
"1968: The Election That Changed America," "Lady Bird Johnson: Our
Environmental First Lady" and "The Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt."
He is currently working on a history of the Republican Party.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How many 20th century American presidents deserve to have four big
volumes written about their lives and times? Robert A. Caro decided
during the mid-1970s that Lyndon Johnson did, and "Master of the
Senate" is the third installment in his massive exploration of the
Texas president's quest for power.</LD>
<LD>   When Caro started his project a generation ago, Johnson's central
place in the nation's history seemed assured. Champion of civil
rights, architect of the Great Society and the president who
escalated the war in Vietnam, Johnson appeared to embody all that was
good and bad about American politics in modern times.</LD>
<LD>   A funny thing happened to LBJ on the way to transcendent
historical importance. Time passed. The Cold War ended, the nation
turned rightward and the tumult of the Vietnam War gave way to other
conflicts, first with Iraq and now with international terrorism. The
Johnson image, once so vibrant and controversial, became fuzzy and
then indistinct.</LD>
<TE>   For Americans born after the mid-1950s, Johnson is remembered, if
at all, for a Stetson, a drawl, an unpopular war and a nation in
turmoil in grainy black-and-white television images. Scholars might,
as they did in the 1990s, reassess Johnson in a more positive way.
But for the nation at large he became, as most presidents do, a relic
of a vanishing era.</TE>
<TE>   For Caro, however, Johnson has remained the pivot on which the
nation's history turned in the century just passed. After winning a
Pulitzer Prize in 1975 for his biography, "The Power Broker: Robert
Moses and the Fall of New York," Caro embarked on a multivolume study
of Johnson under the overall title "The Years of Lyndon Johnson." The
first volume, "The Path to Power," appeared in 1982 and depicted
Johnson's life to 1941 as a ruthless quest for political clout. The
second, "Means of Ascent," came out in 1990, and its recounting of
Johnson's 1948 race for the Senate against Gov. Coke Stevenson of
Texas became controversial for both its laudatory picture of the
racist, reactionary Stevenson and its corrosive portrait of the
ambitious Johnson. Now Caro gets Johnson to the Senate and, in more
than 1,000 pages looks at the years from 1949 to 1960, when Johnson
first wielded national power as Democratic majority leader.</TE>
<TE>   For much of "Master of the Senate," Caro follows the path of
criticism and denunciation that characterized the first two volumes.
When Senate Majority Leader Johnson takes up the Civil Rights Act of
1957 and sees it enacted into law, Caro recognizes that Johnson's
ambition also was tempered with some compassion for African
Americans. The enactment of the law is seen as a redemptive episode
for the ruthless Johnson, who, almost in spite of himself, finally
does the right thing for the first time in his life. This concession
is grudging and limited, but it spurs Caro to some of the best
writing in the three volumes.</TE>
<TE>   Even Caro's marginally greater sympathy, however, for his subject
does not raise Johnson's legislative career to the epic level
implicit in this encyclopedic treatment. In the political context of
the mid-1950s, with Dwight D. Eisenhower in the White House and
Democrats narrowly in control of Congress, the passage of major
legislation could not occur. Much of what Johnson was doing was
inside baseball, of interest now only to specialists who find the era
of Joe McCarthy and the Bricker Amendment still fascinating.</TE>
<TE>   To surmount this problem, Caro writes three books in one volume.
All rest on the notion that the obstructive role of the United States
Senate shaped the sweep of American history as a prelude to the
emergence of Johnson as a senator in 1949. In Caro's view, presidents
such as Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt become almost bit players as
the Senate came to dominate the national stage.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of potted narratives that occupy the first 105 pages
of the book, Caro writes a condensed history of the upper house
starting in the mid-1830s. The short treatments of the Civil War and
Reconstruction, the Spanish-American War and the League of Nations as
episodes in Senate history take the story far from Johnson without
adding anything new to these subjects.</TE>
<TE>   The ensuing 600 pages of the book that cover Johnson from 1949
through 1956 reflect the negative view of Johnson that Caro has long
espoused. Johnson was, Caro has said, "unencumbered by even the
slightest excess weight of ideology, of philosophy, of principles, of
beliefs." The same man appears in these pages as he betrays friends
and causes for personal advancement and power.</TE>
<TE>   Recycling anecdotes and insights from the first two volumes, Caro
spends much time on Johnson's infidelities, fascination with his
sexual prowess and callous behavior toward his staff. Even Lady Bird
Johnson is swept up in Caro's animus against her husband. In several
chapters that mix misogny and prurience, she is depicted as an abused
spouse, too tolerant of her husband's infidelities and heedless of
the emotional needs of her two daughters. For Caro, there was no
mystery in the Johnsons' union, only pathology. But that stern
verdict leaves unexplained how the Lady Bird Johnson of
history--intelligent, dignified and a champion of the
environment--found in her marriage the inspiration for her productive
public career.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to delving into Johnson's private affairs, Caro
examines such episodes as the rejection of the nomination of Leland
Olds for the Federal Power Commission, the political demise of Sen.
Joseph R. McCarthy in 1954 and the parliamentary struggle over the
Bricker Amendment to limit the power of presidents in foreign policy.
These long-forgotten events will have little resonance for
contemporary readers.</TE>
<TE>   Caro spends much time on Johnson's mentor, Sen. Richard Russell of
Georgia. Though Russell was a dedicated and wily segregationist, Caro
treats him with a sympathy and insight that he rarely extends to
Johnson. Russell Baker once called Johnson "a character out of a
Russian novel," but he is simply a sinner in the hands of an angry
biographer.</TE>
<TE>   Caro's obsession with Johnson tends to be selective. Notably
absent from much of Caro's discussion of the Senate and Johnson in
these years are key foreign policy issues. Caro simply does not look
at the position Johnson took when the French role in Indochina
collapsed in 1954 and a clamor arose for American intervention.
Russell and Johnson made it clear that the Democrats would not
support such an initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower also had reservations about the prospect of a land war
in Asia after the Americans saw the French withdraw. Out of these
developments came the creation of North and South Vietnam and the
American presence in the region that Johnson inherited as president a
decade later.</TE>
<TE>   Caro is also silent about the substance of the Suez crisis of 1956
and Johnson's pro-Israel stance at that time. One of the most
interesting revelations regarding Johnson during the last two decades
has been about his efforts in the 1930s and 1940s on behalf of Jews
seeking to escape the Nazis. Working with Jewish leaders in the
Austin area, Johnson went well beyond other American politicians in
his efforts to enable Jews to enter the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Scholars have been exploring the leads in this area first
developed by Louis Gomolak, a graduate student at the University of
Texas, in his 1989 dissertation. Caro does not examine this subject
in analyzing Johnson's compassion, his views on world affairs or the
historical roots of his presidential policies toward Israel during
the 1960s. On balance, Caro's intense focus on Johnson's personal
flaws dominates his narrative, minimizing issues that made the Texas
lawmaker important during the Senate years and that have had a
lasting influence into the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   The climax of the book comes with Caro's 300-page treatment of the
Civil Rights Act of 1957. Here Caro has to overcome his self-created
problem in explaining why Johnson became a champion of civil rights
at this time. In his first volume, he deferred any discussion of
Johnson's work for African Americans as the Texas director of the
National Youth Administration until a future volume. That created a
misleading picture of Johnson's ideological commitments as a young
man.</TE>
<TE>   Now 20 years later in Johnson's life and 20 years after his first
volume appeared, Caro evaluates Johnson's racial record in the
National Youth Administration. He concedes that Johnson's compassion
was genuine, a point that received almost no attention in the earlier
volumes. Caro deals with that lapse by saying that Johnson's concern
for the disadvantaged always yielded to the expedient demands of his
larger ambition for the White House. This harsh judgment ignores
Johnson's capacity to identify with the aspirations of Latinos and
African Americans for real equality, an ability that eluded
Eisenhower, Kennedy for much of his presidency and Richard Nixon.</TE>
<TE>   By 1956, however, Johnson's ambition and compassion for once ran
together. Following his disastrous race for the Democratic
presidential nomination that year, Johnson realized that he could not
get his party's nod for the presidency if he were perceived as just a
Southern politician. So he looked to civil rights to refurbish his
image and advance his candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   Once he began to convince himself that civil rights needed to be
pursued, Caro contends, Johnson became an ever-greater convert to the
cause. This reading of Johnson is likely to provoke some probing
dissent because Caro's account of the senator's civil rights record
is relentlessly slanted against him before this dramatic change of
heart. The possibility that Johnson ever did anything from a decent
motive, such as his concern for Jews in Germany, is so foreign to
Caro that he cannot imbue his subject with any sense of human
sympathy or genuine concern.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, once Johnson sets himself in motion in 1957 to
achieve civil rights legislation for the first time in 82 years,
Caro's tale becomes compelling. The general account will not be new
to specialists. Both Republicans and northern Democrats by 1957
wanted to do something for civil rights, and a bill written by the
Eisenhower White House became the vehicle for congressional action.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of Caro's lengthy story (which could have been pared
down without great loss to his main point), he makes his readers
understand why the Civil Rights Act of 1957, for all its flaws,
marked a genuine turning point for both Johnson and for the United
States. At that point, Caro's protracted narrative runs out of gas,
and he appends two perfunctory chapters on the rest of Johnson's
Senate career. Readers interested in the relationship between Kennedy
and Johnson, the decision to take the vice presidency and the
campaign of 1960 will have to wait for the next phase of Caro's
biography.</TE>
<TE>   That task--writing a fourth volume on the Johnson presidency--will
test Caro's abilities as a historian rather than as a detailed
biographer. His larger assignment will be to draw back from his
meticulous dissection of Johnson as an unpleasant individual and to
see him against the backdrop of American history.</TE>
<TE>   A thousand more pages on the vice presidency and the presidency
like those in "Master of the Senate" will not explain why Johnson
dominated the American consciousness in the mid-1960s and yet receded
so quickly in subsequent decades.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson did not just pursue power for its own sake. He imbibed the
doctrines of American liberalism and upon gaining the White House
sought to implement the programs of the activist national government
that Theodore Roosevelt, Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt had
advocated. Johnson achieved much, including Medicare, the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but eliminating
poverty and coping with the racial inequities of society proved
intractable tasks. With his domestic policy repudiated and memories
of the lost war in Vietnam hounding his record, Johnson's presidency
was always ripe for a quick historical fade-out.</TE>
<TE>   Caro believed that a biography of Johnson would reveal how power
functions in American society, and he has pursued his quarry with a
determination worthy of Johnson himself. But Caro did not allow for
an irony that Johnson might have appreciated: By fulfilling the
agenda of the New Deal and stretching the doctrine of containment in
Vietnam to a tragic point, Johnson ensured that his own historical
moment would be short.</TE>
<TE>   A lone wolf journalist, Caro has remained aloof from the currents
of interpretation about Johnson and the shifts that have occurred in
the president's reputation. As a result, Caro's old-fashioned,
multivolume biography seems not just excessive but irrelevant for
understanding where Johnson stands in the very different America of
George W. Bush and the 21st century.</TE>

<DH>DEATH AND NIGHTINGALES  By Eugene McCabe  Bloomsbury: 230
pp., $23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SALTER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I cannot be the only reader who, reading the rich, rolling, wild
language of the Scottish and Irish, feels that she has a head like a
lottery cage, full of wooden balls with letters on them, cheeks
stuffed chipmunk-like with unfamiliar words but no time (and probably
no place) to look them up. The words rush along too quickly to step
out of the flow. You might well lose your place. As with a visit to
England, their books leave us with strange accents. Their words
convey the melancholy weight of a bloody history; issues of
birthright and inheritance and land and cows and progress fill Eugene
McCabe's novel "Death and Nightingales." Beth's mother married when
she was three months pregnant with Beth (by another man). The man she
married was angry and violent. Beth's mother died from the kick of a
prize bull, leaving "the poor wee morsel" at the mercy of a man who
raised her as his servant.</LD>
<TE>   Beth would not inherit. Her stepfather's gold was locked in the
cellar. It would be so easy to poison him. She falls in love with a
handsome liar named Liam Ward. He makes the plan. But she finds that
he plans to double-cross her when a deaf man reports that he has seen
Liam digging Beth's grave. Then all is fury and revenge with Parnell
in the background inciting cynicism and hope, for a future without
bawling cows and raping fathers and young people desperate to escape
the thicket of authority and shame that has been woven around them.</TE>

<TE>   THE MELANCHOLY OF ANATOMY</TE>
<TE>   Stories</TE>
<TE>   By Shelley Jackson</TE>
<TE>   Anchor Books: 180 pp., $12 paper</TE>
<TE>   I've been waiting for the next Rikki Ducornet, and here she comes,
whistling around the corner as if writing stories was just a question
of stringing words together on a good thick thread. But where
Ducornet has an ornate, Byzantine, highfalutin, sometimes medieval
shimmer to her prose, Shelley Jackson is mistress of bawd; more
cockney, more Chaucer, more gobbledygook. These stories, for example,
are built around the humors: choleric, melancholic, phlegmatic and
sanguinary. They are called "Egg," "Sperm," "Cancer," "Nerve,"
"Blood," "Milk" and "Fat," to name a few. The egg grows and grows
till it takes over the house of the woman who let it slip out; George
works at a nerve supply company; a girl befriends a hair, who brings
friends; an ugly girl gets all the love she needs because she can
control her phlegm. Do not look for metaphor. It will kill you. Just
read the words and make the pictures in your mind that Jackson is
trying to paint.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, it's a subversive book: Every form of authoritarian
language, from medical reports to legal jargon, is ridiculed and
scrambled in these stories. "Sleep is falling. The crumbs run in
drifts down the street, collect in the gutters. Sleep falls every day
at noon here, with soothing regularity. Sometimes it melts on the way
down, and falls as golden rain, or in cold weather, as golden sleet,
but mostly our siesta is warm and dry. The occasional sleepstorm is
cozy and harmless: a war waged with croutons and dinner rolls."</TE>

<TE>   SWIMMING AT SUPPERTIME</TE>
<TE>   Seasons of Delight on the Wrong Side of Buzzards Bay</TE>
<TE>   By Carol Wasserman</TE>
<TE>   Crown: 186 pp., $22</TE>
<TE>   Here is old-fashioned modern poverty, New England style. Carol
Wasserman lives year-round in one of those communities on the East
Coast that is flooded with tourists and renters and summer people in
July and August. The caricature traditionally drawn is of picturesque
but cranky townspeople who cannot wait for the season to end and to
stay triumphantly while everyone else trudges back to work and
wealth.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman's essays in "Swimming at Suppertime" have a bit of that,
the "swamp Yankees," but it slowly dawns that she is really and truly
poor: dump-picking, food-stamping, will-they-take-my-house-away poor.
She is also elderly, and she lives alone. Not for a comma does she
indulge in self-pity: "There have been perhaps four hundred thousand
human generations. And only four or five in which a woman like
yourself could survive alone. Could expect to be left undisturbed, in
silence and solitude, to sleep without fear in her dark house,
waiting for dawn and a decent electrician."</TE>
<TE>   The great love of her life, whom she had only seven years with,
has died, and she dares not leave the house, or the town in which she
grew up, in case he should come back looking for her. She gets work
in a greenhouse or other places. She marvels at white peaches and the
angel who lives in the ATM machine when she receives the first card
of her life. "I have heard it said," she writes, "that there is no
shame in being poor but that it is damned inconvenient."</TE>

<DH>EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED By Jonathan Safran Foer Houghton
Mifflin: 276 pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK ROZZO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jonathan Safran Foer, the 25-year-old author of this remarkable first
novel, was the editor of an anthology of writings devoted to the
American artist Joseph Cornell. The temptation to compare the
brimming, tidbit-strewn and delightful "Everything Is Illuminated"
with one of Cornell's curio-filled boxes is impossible to resist:
They both demand and deserve to be considered repeatedly and from
varying angles; they provoke laughter as easily as they elicit
curiosity; they teem with the unpredictable afterlife of artifacts;
and they unabashedly show off their seams--the paper and glue, the
narrative shifts and intermingling of voices--to the world.</LD>
<LD>   Yet "Everything Is Illuminated" is more than an oddball objet.
It's probably the first convincing report from Generation Y (for lack
of a better label) on the legacy of the Holocaust. It's a powerful
document, telling the story of Jonathan Safran Foer (the
protagonist's name is the same as the author's) and his idealistic
search, during the summer before senior year in college, for
Trachimbrod, the vanished Ukrainian shtetl where his grandfather
somehow escaped the Nazis.</LD>
<LD>   Entwined with this search, in alternating chapters, is Jonathan's
work-in-progress, a precociously surreal novel about Trachimbrod from
1791 to the day the bombs came down in 1941.</LD>
<TE>   The story of Jonathan's sojourn to the Ukraine is told in the
voice of his America-obsessed, Ukrainian Gentile translator and
Sancho Panza, Alex, a fellow who, by his own account, is "always
elsewhere with friends, and disseminating so much currency," usually
in "famous nightclubs." Alex points out that "Lamborghini Countaches
are excellent, and so are cappuccinos," and that "many girls want to
be carnal with me in many good arrangements, notwithstanding the
Inebriated Kangaroo, the Gorky Tickle, and the Unyielding Zookeeper."
In Alex's estimation, the American Jonathan, whom he dubs "the hero,"
is one "ingenious Jew."</TE>
<TE>   As for Jonathan, his tales of Trachimbrod's petty, venal and
sexed-up eccentrics are, in some ways, as hilariously tortured as
Alex's thesaurus-fueled malapropisms. (Think "Fiddler on the Roof"
meets Mel Brooks meets Breughel meets McSweeney's.)</TE>
<TE>   It's as if Foer is lampooning the very idea of experimental
fiction while executing the most appealing version of it in recent
memory. As Foer goes about reminding us of the importance of
remembering, he continually undermines this lesson with outrageous
anachronisms and by showing that the past often looks suspiciously
like the present.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan's search for the fate of his grandfather is equally
fraught with ambivalence; it exposes Jonathan's naivete, but it also,
in a stunning twist, reveals the proximity of Alex's doddering
grandfather to Jonathan's own tragic family history.</TE>
<TE>   With its multiple narrators, spiraling layers of jokes and
breakneck shifts between hilarity and horror, with its Nabokovian
aura of mischief-making, with its sidelong glances at post-Iron
Curtain capitalism and contemporary anti-Semitism, with its
wonderfully unlikely cross-cultural friendship between Jonathan and
Alex and with its daringness to show that irony, in the right hands,
still has the power to enlighten, "Everything Is Illuminated" is a
veritable box of treasures.</TE>

<TE>   MY LIFE IN HEAVY METAL</TE>
<TE>   By Steve Almond</TE>
<TE>   Grove Press: 206 pp., $23</TE>
<TE>   In this slim debut collection of stories, Steve Almond chronicles
the lives of men and women--teenagers, twentysomethings and
thirtysomethings--as they veer between boring office jobs and stints
as expatriates, using their sexual curiosity like antennae probing an
alien landscape. Almond, likewise, has acute sensors when it comes to
the sociological and sexual intersections of modern life. In the
title story, a guy moves to El Paso after college to take a newspaper
job that, much to his girlfriend's dismay, requires him to report
on--and become somewhat obsessed with--the endless series of hair
bands--Skid Row, Motley Crue, Guns N' Roses--that come through town.</TE>
<TE>   In "Geek Player, Love Slayer," a 33-year-old woman gets the hots
for the improbably sexy office computer tech and poses the ponderable
question, "How did Computer Guy become the Lifeguard of the decade?"
And in "The Pass," a narrator examines why pickup lines have become
so passe: "the pass is what semioticians would call a lapsed
signifier."</TE>
<TE>   Almond's eye for modern types is impeccably, almost academically,
sharp, and yet these stories, slight as they sometimes are, never
come across as schoolwork. They're too funny, and, like the jilted
sex buddy of "The Body in Extremis," a story that echoes Mary
Gaitskill and Matthew Klam, they're determinedly "softhearted and
hopeful."</TE>

<DH>How Reading Taught a Young Chinese Boy How to Dream</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SHEFF</AU>
<BD>David Sheff is the author of "China Dawn: The Story of
a Technology and Business Revolution."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edward Tian has been called China's Bill Gates, its Steve Jobs. One
Chinese journal went so far as to call him "Bill Gates and Steve Jobs
rolled into one." As co-founder of AsiaInfo, he helped build that
nation's Internet. Then in 2000, he left AsiaInfo for a
government-funded start-up called China Netcom. Its mission: to
create a broad-band network that would connect China, from its
teeming metropolises to its most remote villages, to the global
Internet via the fastest network on the planet.</LD>
<LD>   "With our technology, enlightenment can flow through the taps like
water," Tian says. "When it does, it will enlighten our whole
nation."</LD>
<LD>   Tian's given name is Suning, an uncommon Chinese name that means
"Remember Leningrad." His parents met in Leningrad in 1954 at the
Forestry Technology Academy. Returning to China in 1960, they were
assigned to work as researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
They married in Beijing in 1961; Tian was born two years later. He
was sent to live with his grandparents in Shenyang because his
parents had been assigned to a research institute in the far-off Gobi
Desert.</LD>
<TE>   Mao Tse-tung's Cultural Revolution began in 1966 when Tian was 4.
As foreign-educated intellectuals, his parents were denounced as
"cow's demon and snake spirit" and were sent to concentration camps.
Tian remained with his grandparents, but their home was taken over by
Mao's Red Guard. When the Guard forced Tian's grandfather to
surrender his beloved collection of world literature to a bonfire in
the frontyard, Tian tried to rip a book out of a soldier's hands.
"These are my grandfather's!" Tian shrieked, but the guard knocked
him to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   There was no word from his parents and almost no food. Tian says
that it was the dark age of his life and the dark age of modern
China, characterized for him by a single emotion: hunger. "All I
remember is hunger," he says. "Hunger for food. Hunger for
information."</TE>
<TE>   Approved writings--Mao's works and volumes of Marxist
propaganda--were the only books allowed during the Cultural
Revolution. As Tian had witnessed, other books--"poisonous
weeds"--were burned. As a result, he says that he had never been told
any stories and had "nothing to give me a dream." He says, "Without
stories, I never learned to dream. I did not dream."</TE>
<TE>   When he turned 11, Tian became gravely ill. His parents, informed
that their son was dying, were allowed to travel to Shenyang, where
they took turns sitting by Tian's bed in the hospital. One afternoon,
his father pulled a book out from where it had been hidden under his
coat and he began to read. The book was an old Chinese translation of
Jules Verne's "L'Ile Mysterieuse" (The Mysterious Island), originally
published in three parts. His father had the first, "Shipwrecked in
the Air."</TE>
<TE>   "'Are we rising again?'</TE>
<TE>   "'No. On the contrary.'</TE>
<TE>   "'Are we descending?'</TE>
<TE>   "'Worse than that, Captain. We are falling!'"</TE>
<TE>   It was the first story Tian had ever heard.</TE>
<TE>   His father read the adventure of the escape from a Confederate
prison in Richmond, Va., by five soldiers who had been fighting for
the North in the American Civil War. They dramatically escaped in a
hot-air balloon, but the balloon crash-landed on an island, where the
men struggled to find food and shelter. The heroic soldiers
miraculously survived.</TE>
<TE>   So did Tian, who grew stronger as he vicariously lived life on the
island, where the men, revitalized, prepared a feast of kangaroo soup
and suckling pig. In the middle of the meal, one of the men let out a
"cry and an oath." When his friends asked what was wrong, the man
replied, "I have just broken a tooth!" He drew from his lips "the
object which had cost him a grinder" and discovered that it was not a
pebble, as they expected. It was a leaden bullet.</TE>
<TE>   His father closed the book. There was no more to read.</TE>
<TE>   Tian was aghast. Who else was on the island? And for 10 years, he
didn't know whether these men lived or died. But he recalls, "I lay
in the hospital bed and I dreamed. For the first time in my life. I
dreamed of many possibilities. Before I had nothing to imagine, but
my imagination had been ignited."</TE>
<TE>   All of China began to dream again, too, when the Cultural
Revolution ended with the death of Mao on Sept. 9, 1976. The
ascension of Deng Xiaoping was celebrated in the streets with drums
and gongs. Deng "opened our eyes to the outside world," Tian says.
"It was like seeing for the first time after living your life in
darkness."</TE>
<TE>   Tian had been a mediocre student, uninspired by the Mao-centric
propaganda disguised as curriculum. However, he took to his studies
with passion and seriousness and won a place at Liaoning University.
The first week on campus, he went to the university's reopened and
replenished library.</TE>
<TE>   "I searched for the second and third parts of 'The Mysterious
Island,'" he recalls. When he found them, he retreated to a corner
table in the library and devoured them. Ten years of wondering what
happened to the castaways was sated in a mere 10 hours. When he
emerged from the library near midnight, he was exhausted and his hair
stuck up like a mad scientist's. But he felt exhilarated.</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, Tian graduated from the university and was accepted at
the prestigious Chinese Academy of Science in Beijing. China's
"opening-up period" was continuing at a thrilling pace, and Deng
encouraged China's best students to go abroad to continue their
education. At 25, Tian left China and arrived at the University of
Texas in Lubbock, where he answered an advertisement for housing and
moved in with an elderly Texan who had never met anyone Chinese.
Because it was difficult for the man to pronounce "Suning," he began
calling his boarder "Ed." Later Ed asked to be called by the more
dignified "Edward."</TE>
<TE>   Tian was extremely lonely in Texas when, one evening, he wandered
into a dark basement on campus and found the deserted computer lab.
He had never used a computer, but he sat down in front of a Macintosh
and pushed a button. He would never forget what he saw: the
Macintosh's opening icon, a smiling face. "Without that smiling face,
I may have shut off the computer and never come back," he says. "The
smiling face welcomed me into a new world."</TE>
<TE>   In spring of 1989, while he worked on his doctorate, Tian became
preoccupied with events in China that were broadcast each evening on
the news. Most nights the lead report was about an astonishing
pro-democracy demonstration that had been growing in Tiananmen Square
in the heart of Beijing. An open demonstration by hundreds of
thousands, soon a million students! But on June 3, the government
sent soldiers and tanks into the square. On the morning of the 4th,
the unthinkable happened: They fired on the students. Hundreds,
perhaps thousands, were killed.</TE>
<TE>   The Tiananmen Square massacre so enraged most Chinese students who
had been studying in America that they resolved to forsake China
forever. Not Tian. He was determined to return. "I thought and
thought after that," he says. "How could I help the people of our
country? It became the central purpose in my life."</TE>
<TE>   Drawn by his experience with the Apple Macintosh's smiling face,
Tian read a biography of the company co-founder, Jobs. He was riveted
to an idea espoused by Jobs: that an entrepreneur, working outside
the structures of established corporations or governments and
inspired by a dream, had enormous power to change society. He also
pondered Jobs' idea that computers are not just computing devices but
tools with the inherent ability to change lives.</TE>
<TE>   A friend convinced Tian to attend a 1992 speech by vice
presidential candidate Sen. Al Gore, during which Gore explained that
an "information superhighway" could transform a nation. How? By
elevating communication and knowledge--exactly what China needed.
"Information! Access! That's what we never had!" Tian says.
"Information threatens the status quo. We hungered for information
when we grew up. The Internet could give Chinese children access. It
could connect them. They could visit any library in the world. They
could talk to others, talk among themselves."</TE>
<TE>   The famous dissident Wei Jingsheng, after emerging from nearly 15
years of solitary confinement in a Chinese jail, once said: "People
long for change, but they despair of it, so they go into business."
Tian, who earned his doctorate in 1992, turned to business but not
because he despaired of change. The opposite: China was stuck in the
past, while the rest of the world raced toward a new, as yet
undefined, future. The overthrow of China's system might seem like
the only answer, but Russia's post-Communist decline showed that it
wasn't enough. Besides, the Tiananmen Square massacre proved that
protests were futile in China.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw another way to change China and I thought that it might be
effective," says Tian. "It was a radical idea, but I became devoted
to it."</TE>
<TE>   When his father read him Verne, Tian learned to dream. Now he
became obsessed with a "big dream, a transforming dream." It was a
dream for China and a direction for his life. In 1993, he returned to
China and built the country's first Internet that was accessible to
ordinary people. His next start-up constructed the world's fastest
and longest (twice as long as the Great Wall) high bandwidth network.
Today, Tian helps run one of the nation's most influential and
largest companies with the power to bring state-of-the-world access
to information and communication to hundreds of millions of Chinese.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese government occasionally attempts to censor and
otherwise control the Internet, but information is flowing through
the taps, if not yet like water. Thirty-five million people are
logged on to the Internet in China. Though it is a tiny fraction of
the nation's 1.3 billion people, the number is doubling every nine
months. The Chinese have what they never had: access to information,
a voice and what once was a mysterious island itself has finally
connected to the rest of the world.</TE>

<HD>Four Questions for Robert A. Caro</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SALTER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: How has your relationship to Lyndon Johnson changed over
the years?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: I don't think it has changed. In the first two volumes,
Johnson was concerned with power. In "Master of the Senate," he earns
the power, but he's the same man. Lord Acton once said, "Power
corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely." The older I get, the
less sure I am about that. Power, whatever else it does, always
reveals a character. When you are able to do whatever you want, the
rest of us see who you are.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson always had compassion for and a desire to help poor
people. Once he had the power, he set out to pass a bill with the
same savage determination he brought to everything else he wanted.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What do you feel is the singular achievement of "Master of the
Senate"?</TE>
<TE>   A: This book examines something seldom written about: legislative
power. When we talk in America about political power, we usually mean
presidential power. I wanted to show what raw legislative power looks
like. And Johnson is the man to do it. He found power where no one
else had ever found it, and he used it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Can you describe a fine day of research?</TE>
<TE>   A: My favorite day was when Bill Bradley took me onto the Senate
floor. I sat next to the dais in the well where Johnson had stood,
looking out at all this burnished mahogany, this majestic scene. A
clerk called for a roll call, and the senators filled up the arcs. It
was like a painter had done the background and then added the
figures. That day was when I knew I'd be able to finish this book.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: In 1999, Kurt Vonnegut asked if you were disappointed with
America. How do you feel about that now?</TE>
<TE>   A: I am disappointed. Someone said that the moral arc of the
universe is law, but it bends toward justice. It is just bending so
slowly. Two of the rising figures in the book--Martin Luther King Jr.
and LBJ--make titanic efforts to improve the lives of black
Americans. We've come a long way but not far enough.</TE>

<HD>Still With the Band</HD>
<DH>Though not one to live in the past, Robbie Robertson
remains proud enough of the Band's legacy to have taken a hand in the
DVD release of 'The Last Waltz.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"I didn't feel old in years; my soul just felt old because of all we
had gone through," Robbie Robertson says as he watches a DVD of "The
Last Waltz," Martin Scorsese's superb documentary of the Band's
farewell concert a quarter-century ago at Winterland in San
Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   "We wanted to keep recording but quit the grind of the road, which
was wearing us down. The plan was for everyone to take time off for
some personal projects and then come back refreshed. I didn't realize
we were all going to fly off and that no one would remember where the
nest was or how to fly back."</LD>
<LD>   It's late afternoon in Robertson's office at DreamWorks Records in
Beverly Hills, and it sounds like a tinge of sadness in his voice as
he looks back at the demise of the Band.</LD>
<TE>   But maybe I'm just projecting. The rock world has certainly missed
the Band.</TE>
<TE>   On nights when the group was in "the zone" on stage, as Robertson
would say, it was hard not to feel this was the best rock 'n' roll
band in the world--the Beatles, Rolling Stones or you-name-it
notwithstanding.</TE>
<TE>   In guitarist Robertson, bassist-singer Rick Danko, drummer-singer
Levon Helm, pianist-singer Richard Manuel and keyboard whiz Garth
Hudson, the Band was blessed with five master musicians, three superb
singers and a storehouse of songs (mostly by Robertson) about family,
community and tradition that were so finely crafted they felt as if
they had been carefully handed down for generations.</TE>
<TE>   The blend of country, blues, gospel and folk seemed as pure as
rich Delta soil. The Band's first two albums--1968's "Music From Big
Pink" and 1969's "The Band"--are classics of American pop culture.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson isn't big on looking back, but he is proud of the Band's
legacy and the way it was captured in "The Last Waltz." That's why he
spent six months upgrading the sound for various "Last Waltz"
projects, including film's current re-release and the DVD, which is
due in stores May 7. The DVD includes two commentary tracks and other
features. The boxed set, from Warner Bros./Rhino, supplements the 30
tracks from the original soundtrack album with 24 other performances
from the concert and rehearsals.</TE>
<TE>   In the restored film, which will be shown on VH1 on May 11, the
Band is joined by some of the most respected musical figures of the
era, including Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison and
Eric Clapton. Scorsese focuses closely on the interaction between the
musicians, offering an intimacy and power that have been rarely
captured on film. Above all, it's an eloquent toast to the glories of
American rock 'n' roll, especially those '60s musicians who turned
the raw energy of the rock pioneers into an art form.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember sitting around back then with Joni [Mitchell], Bob
[Dylan] and Neil [Young] and we would talk about Hank Williams and
Billie Holiday the way people now talk about the people on stage with
us in San Francisco--and I wanted the film to be as presentable as
possible," Robertson says, as on the TV monitor the Band goes into
the playful "Up on Cripple Creek," one of its most popular numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted the sound and picture to be as [sharp] as possible so
younger generations could see where some of the sounds they hear
today came from. I didn't want people to look at it and say it's kind
of faded now, it's not up to par with what we are used to hearing
these days."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson's office in DreamWorks' single-story brick building next
door to the Beverly Hills post office is a combination of rock
history and state-of-the-art music workshop.</TE>
<TE>   Two walls are lined with vintage guitars, including an acoustic
model dating to the early 1900s and an electric instrument with dual
guitar/mandolin necks that Robertson played on "The Weight" during
the "Last Waltz" concert.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the space is devoted to the present, including stacks
of discs of works in progress at the label and sophisticated keyboard
equipment that enables him to sketch out musical ideas. He's a
quietly confident man and a natural storyteller who has been in on
some of rock's historic moments and shares them with an enticing
sense of detail. At 58, he still has the rugged good looks that made
Hollywood race after him with acting offers following "The Last
Waltz." He did star in 1980's "Carny" but has mostly devoted his time
to music.</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks co-founder David Geffen and label executive Mo Ostin
created a position for Robertson in 1998 with a rare mandate that
includes artistic and executive responsibilities. Ostin, then at
Warner Bros., helped finance the filming of "The Last Waltz."</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing started so informally," Robertson recalls over
the sound of the Band from the TV. "We were just going to do a show
with a couple of friends, but then it grew and someone thought it'd
be a good idea to document it. The original plan was just to have a
couple of people walk around with video cameras, but as time went on
we realized we might ought to think about something a little more
substantial."</TE>
<TE>   It was soon obvious they needed a real filmmaker, and luck was on
the Band's side in landing someone of Scorsese's skills.</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese, who grew up on '50s rock 'n' roll and edited the
"Woodstock" documentary film, wanted to direct his own rock film, and
he saw "The Last Waltz" as a cultural event. Before the shooting, he
sat down with the Band and came up with a thick script that gave
specific camera angles for every lyric and chord change in the songs.</TE>
<TE>   Although Winterland was just another drab rock ballroom, the
staging made it look like a European opera house. The musicians
played against a backdrop of "La Traviata" borrowed from the San
Francisco Opera. Huge chandeliers hung from the ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   "That was Boris Leven's idea," Robertson says suddenly, eyeing the
chandeliers and referring to the production designer, whose credits
ranged from "Giant" to "West Side Story."</TE>
<TE>   "He came to us one day and said he had gotten these chandeliers
from 'Gone With the Wind' and thought they would look fabulous, but I
go, 'Chandeliers? I don't think that's going to go over with Neil or
Bob or the rest of the musicians. These people don't do chandeliers,
Boris.'"</TE>
<TE>   Ronnie Hawkins, the first of the guests to join the Band on stage
during the concert, brought the five musicians together in Toronto
around 1960. The Arkansas native was a minor rockabilly figure in the
U.S., but he found a large, enthusiastic audience in Toronto for his
supercharged live show. Drummer Helm had come from Arkansas with
Hawkins, but the other members of the Band were Canadian.</TE>
<TE>   As Hawkins and the Band go through an energetic version of the old
Bo Diddley hit "Who Do You Love?" on the TV, it's easy to picture
what it must have been like in the early '60s when they barnstormed
the South, playing honky-tonks and college halls.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson joined Hawkins' band, the Hawks, when he was in his
mid-teens, so he forsook a lot of schooling, which is surprising
considering that he is one of rock's most articulate and culturally
minded figures.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so excited to be in that world that I didn't think much
about schooling until we played all these universities when I was 18,
19," Robertson says, when asked about the point. "I didn't
necessarily want to trade places with them, but I was interested in
how they were feeding their mind. So I used to read everything I
could get my hands on--to the point it really annoyed Ronnie Hawkins.
He was a street guy. He thought all that intellectual stuff was just
poisoning your mind."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson chuckles at the thought.</TE>
<TE>   It's not until later in the film that Dylan, the other dominant
influence in the Band's career, pops up. The crowd's response was
joyous, but Robertson recalls the era's hostility from Dylan's old
folk crowd, who felt betrayed when the Band added blistering rock 'n'
roll to his old acoustic, folk approach.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't realize when we went to work with Bob that they were
going to boo us and throw stuff at us all over the world," Robertson
says. "After we did that [1966] tour, people were telling Bob,
'You've got to get rid of these guys. They are ruining your career.'
But Bob didn't budge."</TE>
<TE>   The follow-up tour was scrapped, however, after Dylan had a
motorcycle accident in 1966. The Band moved to the Woodstock area in
upstate New York, where Dylan was living, and they would gather most
days to work on material in the basement of the house that became
known as Big Pink.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember typewriters on tables upstairs in the living room and
Bob would write like 30 verses, then take a guitar or piano and
figure out the melody," Robertson says. "Then, someone else would be
typing something and when the page was full, we would go downstairs
and experiment. It was a wonderful time because it was just for us.
Little did we know it would become this big bootleg thing."</TE>
<TE>   "The Basement Tapes," as the music from those days became known,
was the most celebrated bootleg of the rock era. The music, a
marvelous blend of American roots styles, was so fresh that many
critics named it the best album of the year when it was formally
released by Columbia Records in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   That spirit carried over into the Band's own recordings. "Music
From Big Pink" even included songs from "The Basement Tapes." The
more formal "The Band" was the group's creative peak. From "Across
the Great Divide" through "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down," the
songs represented a clearer and more conscious vision--a salute to
the American history and culture that inspired and fascinated
Robertson.</TE>
<TE>   "The reaction to 'Music From Big Pink' gave everybody a confidence
to just knock down all the boundaries," Robertson says.</TE>
<TE>   The thing that strikes you most while watching the Band, Dylan and
the other "Last Waltz" musicians perform "I Shall Be Released" at the
end of the film is how young everyone looks. That's not the way they
seemed at the concert itself.</TE>
<TE>   I was in the audience at Winterland, and there was the sense that
the group had come to the end of the road--and that others on stage,
including Dylan and Clapton, who were all in their 30s, may have been
nearing the end too.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson still looks robust enough to be on stage. It's hard to
imagine that he doesn't feel some regret that the Band couldn't have
kept it together--but again I'm projecting.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson isn't interested in playing "what if?," partially
because the Band's post-"Last Waltz" history has its share of
darkness. The group--minus Robertson--hit the road again in 1983, but
the shows had little impact. Manuel, who long battled alcoholism,
hanged himself in a Florida motel bathroom in 1986. Danko, who also
had substance abuse problems at various points in his career, died in
his sleep at his home near Woodstock in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In his 1993 autobiography, "This Wheel's on Fire," Helm complained
that Robertson tried to control the group and eventually forced it to
break up. Robertson declines to reflect on his relationship with the
Band members, other than to praise them for their musical gifts.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers paint "The Last Waltz" as the end of an era, a time
when artistic impulses were more valued than the novelty flash that
surrounds so many hit acts today. You can feel the Band's influence
on lots of critical favorites, including just about everyone who's
played on the Americana radio format. But the mainstream pop airwaves
have little connection to the music of the Band or the other stars
who stroll through "The Last Waltz."</TE>
<TE>   "The big difference to me is these people in this movie and at
that time were like the voice of that generation," he says when asked
about the difference between the music scenes then and now. "The
music wasn't just background. It played a pivotal part in everyday
life. They wore these records out. Today, the music [on the radio]
isn't the voice of a generation. It's entertainment. It's hard to
find complete artists. I find it to be more to be individual cuts
than full albums.</TE>
<TE>   "But that doesn't mean there aren't things worth finding and
supporting now. A lot of my friends think everything today is
[worthless], but I don't. I really appreciate a lot of it, and I'm
enjoying this process at DreamWorks, working with a bunch of young
artists I want to help groom."</TE>

in the guise of Tobey Maguire. Sam Raimi directs as Peter Parker's
alter ego squares off against the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe).
Kirsten Dunst, above right with Maguire, co-stars.</LD>
<LD>   Also: Woody Allen's "Hollywood Ending" is about a washed-up

<TE>   Two philosophers become fools for love as a feisty princess
schemes to seduce their young student in "Triumph of Love." Pierre
Marivaux's 18th century comedy is turned into a musical romp by
translator James Magruder, composer Jeffrey Stock and lyricist Susan
Birkenhead. Directed by Jules Aaron, the International City Theatre
production features Teri Ralston, Misty Cotton and other Broadway
stage and screen veterans. Opens Friday at the Center Theater in Long
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Music</TE>
<TE>   Always near the cutting edge, the California EAR Unit titles its
latest LACMA program "Brownout." On Wednesday night, it offers
electrifying innovations from the Art Noise scene, including Mark
Trayle's new work for radio-controlled chamber ensemble and Nick
Chase's "Opus" for double turntable and amplified performers. In
addition, performance artist Laetitia Sonami will present a world
premiere; composers Anna Rubin, Karen Tanaka and Barney Childs also
are represented.</TE>
<TE>   Art</TE>
<TE>   "Zero to Infinity: Arte Povera, 1962-1972,'' a much-anticipated
historic survey opening today at MOCA at the Geffen Contemporary in
downtown L.A., focuses on the Italian sculpture of the late 1960s and
'70s that embraced humble materials, found objects and the
commonplace. Adopting a non-hierarchical attitude toward traditional
and mundane materials, the artists initiated a metaphysical and
iconoclastic aesthetic concerned with real life. Above: "Piero
Gilardi, model for L'uomo vogue" (1968).</TE>
<TE>   Dance</TE>
<TE>   Flamenco dancer and choreographer Laila del Monte does double duty
on Saturday at the Alex Theatre in Glendale. In the afternoon, she
and her guitarist husband, Adam del Monte, present an "All Flamenco"
family program. At night, her company joins Middle Eastern artists
for the premiere of "Azahar," evoking a time when Moors ruled Spain
and Christian, Jewish and Islamic influences created a rich culture.
Guest artists include flamenco vocalist Antonio de Jerez, woodwind
virtuoso Pedro Eustache and dancer Kristy "Lailah" Ibarra-Armas</TE>
<TE>   Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to Paul McCartney, below left, it might be just as
appropriate to quote the rival Stones--"This could be the last
time"--as paraphrase his old band--"Why don't we do it on the road?"
Nostalgia is certainly part of the brew the ex-Beatle is serving on
his U.S. tour, as is the thought that he might not pass this way
again. But from all reports, the singer's bond with his audience
yields some powerful moments. At L.A.'s Staples Center on Saturday
and Anaheim's Arrowhead Pond next Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Video</TE>
<TE>   Will Smith became one of the few African American performers to
receive an Academy Award nomination for best actor as Muhammad Ali in

<HD>What the Riots Sparked</HD>
<DH>The ideas born in those turbulent days continue to inform
L.A.'s creative activity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The jury said not guilty. The sky filled with smoke, the looters hit
the streets, and neither justice nor peace seemed immediately
available. So Noni Olabisi sketched. Lula Washington danced. Seth
Kaufman collected charred wood and screws.</LD>
<LD>   And now, 10 years after the riots of 1992, it's clear that plenty
of other Angelenos were doing likewise. A generation of paintings,
murals, songs, books and plays was born amid the anxiety and violence
of spring 1992, and many were weaned on the philanthropic programs
that followed. With the exception of Anna Deavere Smith's one-woman
show "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992," most of those works have faded
from public memory. But behind them stands a group of artists whose
creative lives were reshaped, in sometimes startling ways, by the
riots.</LD>
<LD>   "Basically, every project that I do is very much shaped and marked
by the events of that month," theater and opera director Peter
Sellars says. "It's one of the reasons I live in Los Angeles. This is
the city that went up in flames. And those fires are not
extinguished."</LD>
<TE>   The artists, performers, writers and directors in this story
amount to a small sampling of the city's creative work force, some
prominent, some largely unknown. But together, their experiences
offer not only a novel perspective on those harrowing days, but a
lesson in the limits and possibilities of making art about civic
trauma.</TE>
<TE>   From the first hours of destruction on April 29, 1992, people
began making things.</TE>
<TE>   In South-Central Los Angeles, Noni Olabisi, a full-time hair
stylist and fledgling muralist was at her day job cutting hair. She
had already missed two design-submission deadlines for a mural that
was to go up nearby, her first public commission.</TE>
<TE>   When the Simi Valley jury came back with not-guilty verdicts for
the policemen accused of brutality against Rodney King, "I was
looking at my co-workers' faces," Olabisi recalls. "And one said, 'Do
you know what that means, Noni? It means open season on black
people.'"</TE>
<TE>   Now she had a subject whose resonance was nearly deafening in her
mostly African American neighborhood. She set to work on a design.</TE>
<TE>   In a studio on West Adams, meanwhile, Lula Washington's dance
troupe couldn't keep still. Within a week, the choreographer says,
she had her dancers collaborating on a new piece. "We just couldn't
hold back the feelings and emotions. It was sort of an obsession of
everyone when we'd come to rehearsal," Washington recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Actor Edward James Olmos couldn't sit still, either. On the day
after the verdicts, he challenged looters to join him in cleaning up.
The next morning, a Friday, he drove up to the African Methodist
Episcopal church on Adams near Western and pulled out a broom.</TE>
<TE>   "I swept the parking lot," Olmos recalls. "Then I walked down the
street and kept on sweeping. It was ludicrous, to be honest with
you--one person in the middle of the street with a broom."</TE>
<TE>   But then an old woman joined him, and a television news truck came
by, then a truck full of teenagers arrived, and so on. For three
days. At the peak, Olmos estimates, he had tens of thousands of
people with him--an act of street theater that became a central image
in the city's tentative recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Seth Kaufman headed for the ruins. The then 33-year-old assemblage
artist spent months combing through burnt-out buildings, scavenging
artifacts no looter would look at twice, recasting them as abstract
art.</TE>
<TE>   Poster artist Robbie Conal abandoned his usual low-tech caricature
style and used digital photo manipulation to make an image of a
flaming nightstick. "I was just so upset," Conal says, "that I didn't
think drawings or ugly paintings of ugly white guys would be enough."</TE>
<TE>   So the responses went, from discipline to discipline, some
projects arising overnight, some gestating for years. The rapper Ice
Cube, who was writing angry lyrics about Los Angeles police well
before the jury came back in Simi Valley, added riot-related material
to his album "The Predator" in time for its late 1992 release. The
Long Beach punk-ska band Sublime came up with "April 29, 1992
(Miami)," a song released in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, on the fifth anniversary of the riots, Showtime aired
"Riot," a fictional view of the unrest seen through black, Anglo,
Asian and Latino characters. Producers Harry Winer and Judith Polone
recruited writers and directors from different ethnic backgrounds,
then wove the results together with a cast including Mario and Melvin
Van Peebles, Luke Perry and Cicely Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, the movie industry had already weighed in by the time
the verdicts were read. "Boyz N the Hood" and "Grand Canyon" had been
released in the second half of 1991, after the March 3 beating of
Rodney King and the March 4 airing of the video, but months before
the riots.</TE>
<TE>   Independent film producer Stephanie Allain, who oversaw "Boyz" as
an executive for Columbia Pictures, says that since the riots, "the
dramas that were about life in the inner city aren't getting made
anymore. It's really hard to get money for movies that are about
social reality."</TE>
<TE>   It might seem hard, too, to wrestle a children's story from the
riots, but writer Eve Bunting collaborated with illustrator David
Diaz to produce "Smoky Night," a book about anger and tolerance that
won the 1995 Caldecott Medal, the country's most coveted award for
children's picture books.</TE>
<TE>   Novelists Bebe Moore Campbell and Paula L. Wood also incorporated
riot stories and multicultural tensions into new books. Poet and
essayist Wanda Coleman took the reins as guest editor of High
Performance magazine and stayed up three days straight to lead a
corps of volunteers through assembly of a 90-page issue on the
verdict and riots. It hit the streets before May was over.</TE>
<TE>   The Cornerstone Theater Company, whose mission is to enlist
overlooked communities in the theater-making process, had just opened
up shop in L.A. Less than a week before it was scheduled to hold its
first auditions here, the riots broke out--"a grim confirmation that
we had chosen the right city," co-founder Bill Rauch says.
"Everything we've done in Los Angeles was framed by the riots, and
everything continues to be."</TE>
<TE>   At major arts institutions around Los Angeles, "everybody was
totally petrified" in the weeks after the verdict, and administrators
were soon scrambling to do big things quickly, recalls Adolfo Nodal,
then the general manager of the city's Cultural Affairs Department.
By early 1993, Nodal's department would distribute nearly $500,000 in
one-time grants, most of them in increments of less than $3,000.</TE>
<TE>   Other institutions created or expanded education and community
outreach programs. Gordon Davidson's Center Theatre Group
commissioned Anna Deavere Smith, whose one-woman, multiple-character
documentary play premiered to widespread acclaim at the Mark Taper
Forum the following year (see accompanying essay).</TE>
<TE>   Also "Which Way, L.A.?" was born. In June 1992, public radio
station KCRW-FM (89.9) asked broadcast journalist Warren Olney to be
the host of a round-table conversation. The program evolved into a
permanent fixture of civic life, frequently serving as the kitchen
table for the region's ongoing cultural conversation.</TE>
<TE>   On the whole, "I don't want to say the rebellion was a good thing,
but in a sense it helped us," Nodal says.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Antar Mason, artistic director of the Venice-based Hittite
Empire, an African American performance ensemble, casts a more
jaundiced eye on those days.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, there was all this discretionary money," Mason
recalls. "Everybody wanted to do some kind of token appeasement. Was
it nice to have so many people interested in what we were doing? Yes,
it was. Did I know that it was going to be fleeting? From Day 1, I
knew it was going to be fleeting."</TE>
<TE>   As the riots began, says artist Willie Robert Middlebrook, "I
didn't know anything about it. I had a studio in San Pedro, and I was
photographing that day, and for some reason I didn't listen to the
radio and didn't listen to the TV. As I'm leaving San Pedro at about
6 p.m., I see the smoke rising over downtown."</TE>
<TE>   Drawing closer to his home in Compton, Middlebrook saw buildings
aflame, looters on the hoof, cars accelerating on the wrong side of
the road--"Total anarchy. It was like waking up in the middle of 'The
Twilight Zone.'"</TE>
<TE>   For Middlebrook, who was already wrestling with social issues in
his art, the riots were a stomp on the accelerator pedal. Invited to
create a riots-related work for a California African American Museum
show, Middlebrook seized on the idea of identity: how we see
ourselves, how other people see us, and the consequences when those
images differ. Soon he had a work dominated by 16 black-and-white
self-portraits.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a big black guy," explains Middlebrook, 44. "When I walk into
a room, for some reason, heads turn. So I figured the perfect person
for it was me."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Museum of Art later acquired the work,
titled "In His 'Own' image." Then last year the piece took on yet
another life, when LACMA invited Middlebrook to expand it for an
interactive children's exhibit. The resulting 40-foot-longwork is on
display in the museum's Boone Children's Gallery through Sept. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll always remember that feeling when I drove into Compton,"
Middlebrook says. "Before that point, I had never been lost in
America. And that's in my work from time to time. It recurs, because
there's no way to get rid of that feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Stage director Sellars too had already set his career on a
sociopolitical tack. Known for his daring adaptations and enthusiasm
for multicultural ventures, Sellars was assembling a program for the
Los Angeles Festival as the police trial advanced.</TE>
<TE>   Sellars viewed the riots as "a very precise statement, drawing a
map in flames." For him, he adds, interpreting that map is "the
assignment for a lifetime of work, and I take that very seriously."</TE>
<TE>   With virtually every production, his commitment to confronting
racial politics emerges in a new permutation--sometimes inspiring
critical raves, sometimes walkouts. He shifted programming of the
L.A. Festival (which has since folded) to address racial politics.
Directing a 1994 production of "The Merchant of Venice" that began at
Chicago's Goodman Theater, Sellars updated the setting to Venice,
Calif., cast African Americans as Jews, Latinos as Venetians, Asians
as the Bel-Air-dwelling privileged class. Directing a 1998
collaboration with Cornerstone, he moved the setting of Jean Genet's
"The Screens" from North Africa to East Los Angeles, replacing French
colonial authorities with National Guardsmen.</TE>
<TE>   In these ventures, says Sellars, the idea is to challenge
audiences to look beyond their immediate social landscape. He adapted
"The Merchant of Venice" the way he did, he says, because the play
"is about racism as an economic condition. And it's also a play in
which there's a major trial, and the wrong verdict is reached. The
people who reach the verdict are smugly confident that they won't
have to change their attitudes or their lifestyles. And Shakespeare
begs to differ."</TE>
<TE>   Commercial artist David G. Brown came at the riots from a vastly
different starting point--or rather, the riots came at him.</TE>
<TE>   He had been designing movies posters and packaging for various
clients, with no particular social agenda. But when the verdict was
read and the chaos grew, Brown holed up in his Mid-Wilshire home and
watched on television as looters overran his grocery store and dry
cleaner. Then his mind wandered back to the daydreams he had as a
child about drawing his own comic book series.</TE>
<TE>   "My concept was to do this superhero, the L.A. Phoenix, who rose
from the ashes of the riots to show young people there was a better
way too solve conflicts," Brown says. When his application for a
$2,370 city Cultural Affairs Department grant was approved and the
Phoenix project took wing, "it was like an epiphany: This is what I
should be doing now."</TE>
<TE>   Before he fell from view, the Phoenix soared through a 16-page
first edition for schools and libraries, scolding looters and calming
cops as he went. He was sighted on CNN. He starred in an
anti-graffiti, anti-gangs, anti-drugs comic-book trilogy, and he
brought his creator into contact with a new community of activists
and educators.</TE>
<TE>   Brown joined that community. He still does commercial work but has
also developed a "Tales From the Kids" comic-book workshop that
guides children in designing their own stories and seeing them
through to publication. Such projects, which typically rely on
government grants and private sponsors, now make up the lion's share
of his income.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the inception of a whole new career for me," said Brown,
47. "If the riots didn't happen, my focus would be getting to a
corporate art director position."</TE>
<TE>   Like Brown, Olabisi hasn't quite escaped her day job. But she has
augmented it in a big way. Just outside the door of her hair salon at
West 54th Street and Western Avenue stands the work that came of her
spring 1992 sketches, a project that launched her as a muralist.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly painted in black, white and red, the wall shows African
warriors, a lynching, and a smoldering cityscape behind a man in a
T-shirt that reads "No Justice, No Peace." The work's title is
"Freedom Won't Wait."</TE>
<TE>   Olabisi, now 47, completed it in 1993, with backing from the
Venice-based Social &amp; Public Art Resource Center. Much of the imagery
is troubling, but that, says Olabisi, is the point. It passed a
neighborhood vetting process, and when center officials are asked to
name a mural that deals with the riots, hers is the first answer.</TE>
<TE>   Olabisi has worked steadily as a public artist since 1993, both
alone and in concert with collaborators. Her works include a Rosa
Parks poster for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and her
largest and most controversial mural so far, "To Protect and Serve"
(1996), an admiring visual history of the Black Panthers movement
painted on the side of a barber shop at 11th Avenue and Jefferson
Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   The more she works as a muralist, Olabisi says, the more broadly
she looks at subject matter. "I know that people are used to me doing
black, black, black work," she says. But lately, she's more attracted
to the idea that "it's not really about the color thing. It's about
the spirit."</TE>
<TE>   While artists like Brown and Olabisi found their careers
accelerating in new directions after the riots, others found dead
ends and detours.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Antar Mason and the Hittite Nation put together a pair of
performance pieces addressing the April 29 police verdicts and their
aftermath, and soon had bookings at prominent venues in Los Angeles
and New York. But since that brief burst of attention, Mason says,
he's found that his Venice-based company has to go on the road to
stay busy, taking residencies in such cities as Austin, Texas, and
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   During the last decade, Mason says, "I've created seven new pieces
about Los Angeles, but no one here in Los Angeles has seen the work."</TE>
<TE>   At Lula Washington's studio, where the choreographer and her
dancers spent all those hours on their feet while the city smoldered,
the troupe came up with "Check This Out." The 40-minute piece starts
with a chant of "no justice, no peace" against projected street
scenes of burning, looting, police and rioters. The score by Bob Dale
evolves from radio static to percussive bursts, then sound bites from
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles). The dancers move through
emotional, sometimes violent gestures, and recite recollections of
those harrowing days.</TE>
<TE>   After a handful of performances in Los Angeles to mixed reviews,
Washington and her company took a condensed version of the piece to a
booking conference in 1993. Several presenters, Washington says, told
her they were looking for riots-related work. When the company
presented the excerpt, everything changed.</TE>
<TE>   "It alienated everybody, basically," Washington says. The company
landed no bookings, she recalls, and had to scramble elsewhere to
fill in the gap.</TE>
<TE>   "People felt we were angry and we were hostile, even though the
piece had an upbeat, optimistic ending," Washington says. Though the
work has prompted standing ovations at some performances and was
chosen for staging under the banner of Sellars' L.A. Festival, she
says she has come to realize that it's "so raw and in-your-face that
it frightens people."</TE>
<TE>   She handles it gingerly now, as one would a loaded weapon, and
when a presenter requests it, "I let them know that it's hard for
some people to digest." The reality, she says, is that sometimes
"they say they want this, but they really want something that's
safer."</TE>
<TE>   For Kaufman, the assemblage artist who spent those months sifting
through the ashes, a far more rewarding creative experience seemed to
be taking shape. His sooty, scavenged abstractions quickly won him an
invitation to mount a one-man art show and organize a group show
about the riots elsewhere. He was also hired by Absolut vodka.
Kaufman led a multicultural artists' collaboration that went up in
lights over Sunset Boulevard. "Have Hope Help Heal," it said.</TE>
<TE>   The one-man show, "Dwelling in Rebellion/A Year to the Day," at
the Zero One Gallery on Melrose Avenue, led to about two dozen sales,
at prices from $200 to $3,000. A batch of melted liquor bottles in a
burnt box, titled "Toast of the Town," went to a collector in
Colorado. Another work of burned wood and screws, titled "Sniper
Number One," landed in the joint collection of the Laguna Art Museum
and the Orange County Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   He was in demand as never before, yet "my life, my sense of
security, had been stripped from me. It deeply affected my sense of
mortality. I had never seen my society completely disintegrate," says
Kaufman, now 44. "I did nothing for an entire year but address my
experience of the riots."</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman took himself out of the riot-artifact business in 1993. "I
didn't want to become 'The Riot Guy.' I exorcised what I needed to
get out of me, and it was time to move along," Kaufman says. "I came
out of that year broke."</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman still works in assemblage, selling through a dealer in San
Francisco, and his bio shows a healthy list of exhibitions, sales and
events in recent years. But he looks back at his post-riots work with
deep ambivalence.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very tumultuous and painful journey," he says. "I came
under attack in many cases, in fact, because I was a white guy
talking about issues that had largely affected inner-city groups. But
the fact is that we were all terrified as we drove around the city,
and we all saw the buildings on fire."</TE>
<TE>   In the face of such stories, says Mark Greenfield, director of
Watts Towers Arts Center since 1993, it may help to remember that
"art doesn't have to be permanent. Maybe, sometimes, it's a matter of
putting a bandage over the wound, and letting the wound heal."</TE>
<TE>   Greenfield, who has done painting and assemblage, remembers being
recruited to join a 1995 gallery exhibition of African American and
Korean American artists. Meeting on weekends to plan, paint and relax
over lunch, Greenfield and Korean American artist Kyongho Shin Ko
made a painted particle-board picture puzzle of a Latino man selling
oranges and flowers by a freeway onramp. The work was titled "Just
Five Bucks."</TE>
<TE>   Its enduring value? Hard to calculate. But a decade later, the
relationship between the collaborators is intact. Out of it came an
invitation for Greenfield to sit on the board of the Korean American
Museum.</TE>
<TE>   As for the artwork itself, Greenfield says, "I could not tell you
where it is now. But I'd much rather have the friendship."</TE>

<HD>The Determined and the Furious</HD>
<DH>With a solid plan and a do-it-yourself ethic, six L.A.
newcomers launch the Furious Theatre Company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The story so far for the Furious Theatre Company brings to mind a
soul music classic by Otis Redding: 2,000 miles they roamed, to make
a loading dock their home.</LD>
<LD>   But unlike the lonely, bereft fellow bewailing a life gone wrong
in Redding's "[Sittin' on] The Dock of the Bay," the six young,
unheralded proprietors of the fledgling Furious troupe have been so
awash in good luck leading up to this weekend's debut that they find
it almost stunning.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly everything has gone right over the past few months for
these transplanted Middle Americans, ages 25 to 28, who came to L.A.
to make their way as actors and directors.</LD>
<TE>   The Furious partners found a very un-theater-like venue they could
use rent-free--the vast, empty shipping and receiving area of a
former plastic-container factory in Pasadena. They have curtained off
a 99-seat performance space from the rest of the echoing,
high-ceilinged expanse, and were set to open Friday with the U.S.
professional premiere of "Saturday Night at the Palace."</TE>
<TE>   The 1982 drama is by Paul Slabolepszy, a leading South African
playwright whose work seldom has been seen in America. It concerns
two young, white men who arrive after midnight at a burger joint
manned by a Zulu named September. One of the whites, a would-be
professional soccer player, is seething with frustration and
resentment over his lot in life. A blowup is preordained, but the
surprise is in the shocking way it plays out.</TE>
<TE>   Athol Fugard, South Africa's most celebrated dramatist, regards
Slabolepszy as "one of the most mature and significant talents in the
contemporary South African theater scene....His plays deal very
directly with the issues that the modern country is facing." Fugard,
responding by e-mail while immersed in rehearsals for the Mark Taper
Forum's May 23 opening of his new play, "Sorrows and Rejoicings,"
said he considers "Saturday Night at the Palace" to be Slabolepszy's
most powerful play.</TE>
<TE>   The Furious founders say they raised $45,000 before they had sold
their first ticket. They started with $15,000 of their own money, and
an additional $25,000 came in corporate grants--a rarity for a
theater with no track record. The kitty is big enough, and the
rent-free expenses are low enough, they say, to see the nonprofit
theater through two seasons of three plays each, regardless of
box-office returns. The creative goal, says one founder, Sara
Hennessy, is to do plays that "go beyond what is comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Furious theater, says Damaso Rodriguez, the company's managing
director, will be defined by a sense of rawness and high energy, an
attempt to make audiences feel a play's impact rather than
intellectualize what they see. "We'll tell a story really intensely,
and you'll go along for the ride."</TE>
<TE>   The Furious founders have no illusions about the odds, so their
planning has been meticulous. Keep expenses low. Raise money. Be
committed. Be united. Do it yourself.</TE>
<TE>   Their sojourn in Los Angeles did not begin with any special
promise. The six arrived with unprepossessing academic credentials:
bachelor's degrees in theater from Texas A&amp;M, Illinois State and
Southwest Missouri State. Rodriguez and Hennessy married before their
senior year at A&amp;M. After graduating in 1996, they headed to Chicago
because they had contacts there and knew they could quickly land
roles in small, professional theaters. Furious Theatre's first,
informal incarnation was born in the Windy City.</TE>
<TE>   It produced an original drama called "Ramblers," which the Chicago
Tribune called "one of those shows that restores your faith in the
regenerative powers of low-budget theater ... a veritable feast of
raw talent."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles had been the goal all along, so at the end of 1998 the
initial Furious foursome--Rodriguez and Hennessy and another couple,
Shawn Lee Martin and Vonessa Martin--packed their belongings and all
the props and set pieces for "Ramblers" into a 22-foot Ryder truck
and drove 2,000 miles west.</TE>
<TE>   Joining them in L.A. were Eric Pargac, another Texas A&amp;M graduate,
and Brad Price, who grew up with Shawn Martin in Bonne Terre, a
Missouri town of 4,000. They rented a small Hollywood theater in 1999
and put on a six-week run of "Ramblers." It received scant attention
and lost several thousand dollars. At least, Rodriguez says, they
learned how not to do it.</TE>
<TE>   For a year, the six pursued careers separately, but remained close
socially and continued to deepen their bonds on camping trips--the
outdoor life was part of L.A.'s attraction, they say. What's more,
four of them wound up working for the same Internet company.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez and Hennessy took unpaid internships at A Noise Within,
the classical theater company in Glendale. There they found a mentor
in Art Manke, A Noise Within's co-founder and resident director.
Rodriguez extended his apprenticeship with Manke beyond the
internship by serving as his assistant director and dramaturge for
productions of "Hay Fever" by Noel Coward and Shakespeare's
"Pericles."</TE>
<TE>   Manke has been impressed by Rodriguez's commitment and work
ethic--and by the detailed, carefully reasoned approach the Furious
founders have taken in mapping the launch. "So many theater companies
are started by actors who have far more enthusiasm and artistic
temperament than patience for putting together the foundation of a
business," Manke said. "Damaso has a balance, a maturity beyond his
years in being really business-savvy."</TE>
<TE>   Last June, the six Furious founders convened for a weekend of
brainstorming in a rented Palm Springs condo. The agenda: to lay the
conceptual groundwork for a theater company that would last. They
covered the sliding-glass living room doors and a kitchen wall with
poster board. Then, with markers, they filled the walls with their
dreams and goals, and the do's and don'ts of turning their ambitions
into realities.</TE>
<TE>   In the ensuing months, they accomplished much of what they had
scrawled. They found a rent-free home--thanks to an agreement with
the Armory Center for the Arts, which holds a lease on the city-owned
former factory known as the Armory Northwest. Several other
grass-roots arts organizations are quartered in the building,
including an Armory-run art gallery, a folk-dance company and the
Conservatory of Puppetry Arts.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Ward, Armory executive director, says other performing
groups wanted to move into the warehouse. But he was struck by "the
sheer energy, the sheer ambition" of the Furious leaders--along with
a mild-mannered politeness that Ward says belies their hard-edged
name. "They demonstrated that they meant what they said they were
going to do."</TE>
<TE>   The Furious founders kept their remodeling expenses low--about
$10,000--by bargain hunting and doing the work themselves. The
Pasadena Playhouse contributed used theater seats. Hennessy, armed
with experience from a college course in costume-making, and with a
sewing machine bought at a garage sale, stitched remnants into the
15-foot-long black velour curtains that serve as walls cordoning off
the performing space from the rest of the warehouse.</TE>
<TE>   She spilled blood doing it, skewering her left index finger just
as the job was nearly done. An X-ray of the broken-off needle point
that lodged in Hennessy's finger will be part of the lobby decor, the
Furious founders say--proof that blood and tears, as well as sweat,
went into the making of their theater.</TE>
<TE>   The company has set a lineup of plays it thinks will brand Furious
Theatre as something distinctive on the L.A. scene.</TE>
<TE>   After "Saturday Night at the Palace" will be another U.S.
premiere: "Noise," by British playwright Alex Jones. It depicts a
confrontation between a young couple who are expecting a baby and
trying to get ahead in life, and the slacker in the apartment next
door who blasts them with techno music. The season ends in September
with the company's first attempt at a classic: J.M. Synge's "The
Playboy of the Western World."</TE>
<TE>   Manke sees adventure--and risk--in the Furious programming
approach. "Starting with a premiere of an unknown work--that's really
hard for an audience who doesn't know anything about the company or
the play. It's a big hurdle, a big challenge. But on the other hand,
it's very exciting."</TE>
<TE>   With marriages and long-standing friendships as their glue, the
Furious founders think they have the staying power to make their
venture work.</TE>
<TE>   Leaning against the ladder she was using to hang the stage lights,
Vonessa Martin recalled a recent debate over group finances that got
a bit heated.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone can be snappy, but it washes away--like with a brother
and sister," she said. "We have become unconditional."</TE>

<HD>The Spirit Moves Them to Entertain</HD>
<DH>A few producers see potential in films that have Christian
themes but don't preach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDRE CHAUTARD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frustrated with Hollywood, which has shied away from making films
with spiritual themes or religious characters, a handful of
independent producers are striking out on their own to make
Christian-themed films that seek to entertain more than preach.</LD>
<LD>   "There are a lot of people within the religious community that are
just hungering for a high-quality film with a spiritual message,"
says Bob Beltz, a Presbyterian minister from Littleton, Colo., and
co-producer of "Joshua," which will be released next month. Based on
the novel of the same name (which sold 10 million copies), "Joshua"
is a G-rated, modern-day parable about a mysterious stranger's effect
on the lives of the residents of a small Midwest town.</LD>
<LD>   Mitch Davis directed the recently opened "The Other Side of
Heaven" (2001), based on Elder John Groberg's memoirs of his
adventures as a Mormon missionary on the South Pacific island nation
of Tonga in the 1950s. "It was never our intent to make a movie for
Mormons," Davis says. "It was always our intent to make a movie for
the world and for a general audience. We're not trying to proselytize
with this movie at all, but we're not trying to hide what it's about,
either."</LD>
<TE>   The hope of these filmmakers and independent producers is that
films such as "Joshua" and "The Other Side of Heaven" can build on a
grass-roots support within the Christian community and cross over to
a more mainstream audience, unlike past independent releases such as
"The Omega Code" and "Left Behind: The Movie."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to evangelical moviegoers, those films were financially
successful--"Omega Code" grossed $12.6 million and "Left Behind" sold
2.5 million copies on video, followed by $4.2 million at the box
office--but were lacking in production values and were poorly
reviewed in the nonreligious press.</TE>
<TE>   Those films, "Joshua" director Jon Purdy says, were "kind of
fear-based. They're post-apocalyptic." He says "Joshua" is more
hopeful. "It's attempting to portray faith in a positive way. And I
think there's a big question in there as to whether or not hope sells
versus fear."</TE>
<TE>   "The Other Side of Heaven" has already grossed $2 million since
December from a regional release in Utah, Idaho and Texas--states
with large Mormon communities--despite never having played on more
than 50 screens at once.</TE>
<TE>   That encouraged Excel Entertainment to give the film a national
release April 12 on several hundred screens. The film, though panned
by major critics, cracked the top 20 and has so far grossed $3.5
million. Artisan Entertainment, which is distributing "Joshua," also
wanted to build word-of-mouth with an unorthodox release pattern.
Before moving into larger metropolitan areas like Los Angeles, where
advertising costs are much higher, it is releasing the film first in
areas where religious-themed films have done well.</TE>
<TE>   "Joshua" opened April 19 on 220 screens in 11 states, mostly in
the South and Southwest. The film will widen to another 50 cities on
Friday and will reach New York and Los Angeles on May 24. "Joshua" is
reaching out to mainstream moviegoers with the usual television and
newspaper ads, as well as targeting churchgoers with mailings, Web
sites and screenings for religious press and leaders. A soundtrack
with Christian artists such as Jaci Velasquez, Pete Orta and Point of
Grace was put together, and best-selling Christian singer-songwriter
Michael W. Smith was brought in to score his first film.</TE>
<TE>   Other independently funded, spiritually themed films have found it
a challenge to entice nonreligious moviegoers. The boxing drama
"Carman: The Champion," from early last year, grossed only $1.8
million and the wholesome extreme-sports film "Extreme Days" managed
only $700,000 last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Megiddo: The Omega Code 2" (2001), which carried a significantly
higher budget--$22 million--than the first, finished with a
disappointing $6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Excel's first release, "God's Army" (2000), a drama about Mormon
missionaries in Los Angeles, grossed a profitable $2.6 million, but
its director Richard Dutcher's darker follow-up, "Brigham City"
(2001), made only $800,000.</TE>
<TE>   One encouragement, ironically, has been the success earlier this
year of a major studio picture: Warner Bros.' $40-million-grossing "A
Walk to Remember," which featured a devout main character and was
marketed, in part, to Christian audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, as much as Davis admired that film, "they didn't ever dare in
the entire film to say what [the producer of 'A Walk to Remember']
called 'the J-word' and they never dared show anyone praying, because
they were afraid to," Davis says.</TE>
<TE>   Budgeted at $8.5 million, "Joshua" is based on the first in a
series of novels by the Rev. Joe Girzone. Beltz, minister,
co-producer and an author himself, first read the book in 1985 and
optioned the movie rights when they became available two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The film was shot in 23 days near Chicago and briefly in Rome.
Director Purdy, who has written scripts exploring religion but
doesn't describe himself as religious, was brought in.</TE>
<TE>   "Having someone like me on board probably helped prevent the movie
from going in the direction of its worst tendencies and helped create
a movie that functions on a dramatic level, that still makes the
statements that they wanted to make," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Casting the role of Joshua, a woodcarver who starts rebuilding the
town's storm-ravaged Baptist church and draws the ire of a Roman
Catholic priest (F. Murray Abraham), was crucial.</TE>
<TE>   "Playing Jesus or someone who might be Jesus is not the sort of
thing that a lot of actors want to do," Purdy says. Deciding to cast
someone who looked different from the iconic image of Jesus, the
filmmakers turned to actor-director Tony Goldwyn, best known for his
villainous roles in films such as "Ghost," "The Pelican Brief" and
"Kiss the Girls."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the book, in which Joshua is more of a leader and outright
preacher whose identity is apparent early on, Goldwyn in the film
"portrays this character just as a person who is admirable and
someone you like--someone that does good works but doesn't force it
on anyone," Purdy says.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the book's rants against the Catholic bureaucracy and calls
for reform were mostly left out of the film. "A real effort was made
to dramatize the message and not sermonize it," Purdy says.</TE>
<TE>   "The Other Side of Heaven's" path to the screen started when
director Davis read Groberg's 1994 book, "In the Eye of the Storm,"
and was enthralled with the portrait of Polynesian life seen through
the eyes of a callow young man from Idaho. Davis purchased the movie
rights and wrote the screenplay, drawing on the memoirs and the saved
correspondence between Groberg, now 68, and his family and future
wife, Jean, played in the film by Anne Hathaway ("The Princess
Diaries").</TE>
<TE>   Davis, a former studio executive who was a missionary in Argentina
in the late 1970s, had long wanted to make a film about the
missionary experience. "We live in a world where most guys 19 to 21
years of age are hanging out at frat parties with a six-pack and
coeds, and while my buddies were doing that I was in this foreign
land trying to learn a foreign language, coming of age in a really
quick way and in a very profound way," he says. "The Other Side of
Heaven" was budgeted at $7 million and filmed in New Zealand and the
Cook Islands over 10 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Gorham, who plays Groberg, is a non-practicing
Protestant who knew little about the Mormon faith before he was cast.
He says he learned that the young missionaries are "not a bunch of
crazy zealots out trying to ruin cultures. They're young kids and
they're idealists and they believe in what they're doing."</TE>
<TE>   But the film is more a coming-of-age story than a religious tract.
"It's an adventure and a love story that happens to be about a guy
who is a missionary," Davis says.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mormon Church itself isn't really discussed that often in the
movie," says Gorham, who was a cast member on the TV series "Popular"
and will be in the new Showtime sci-fi series "Odyssey 5" this
summer. "I wasn't interested in doing a church film--something that
would be shown at all the temples, you know?"</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Davis says, there has been no official support from the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which historically has
chosen to stay away from commercial ventures.</TE>
<TE>   The companies behind "Joshua" and "The Other Side of Heaven" are
banking on families looking for morally uplifting entertainment.
Epiphany Films is already developing a sequel to "Joshua" based on
another book in the series, "Joshua in the Holy Land," "a story
that's obviously extremely relevant today," Beltz says. A prequel
with a younger Joshua is also being discussed.</TE>
<TE>   Later this year, Artisan will release the Christian-themed "Jonah:
A VeggieTales Movie," the first theatrical film of the popular
animated direct-to-video series.</TE>
<TE>   Excel is developing director Dutcher's next project, "The
Prophet," based on the life of Mormon Church founder Joseph Smith Jr.
Parent company Crusader Entertainment is also producing
family-oriented dramas with less of an overt spiritual component,
including "Swimming Upstream," with Geoffrey Rush and Judy Davis,
about a champion Australian swimmer overcoming a troubled family
life, and "Children on Their Birthdays," based on a Truman Capote
short story about kids during the Depression, with Christopher
McDonald and Sheryl Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, for one, thinks it's high time for a return to making films
like "Places in the Heart," "Chariots of Fire" and "Lilies of the
Field," "movies that all have a sort of religious element to it
without ever making me feel like, 'Oh wow, they want to make me one
of them.'"</TE>
<TE>   "How ironic it is that we live in a culture or a society where
it's perfectly acceptable to make a movie that helps you get inside
the head of a cannibal, and it's kind of hip and politically correct
to make that movie, but to make a movie where you try to get inside
of the head of someone who believes in God is taboo."</TE>

<HD>Insights From a Perpetual Outsider</HD>
<DH>The creator of 'Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992' examines the
riots' echoes.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Summer 1992.</LD>
<LD>   Gordon Davidson, artistic director of the Mark Taper Forum, took
me out to breakfast in New York City after seeing my play "Fires in
the Mirror," about riots in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, in August 1991.
Those riots were the consequence of a buildup of tensions between
blacks and Jews, sparked by the death of a young black boy, Gavin
Cato, and the murder of a young Hasidic scholar, Yankel Rosenbaum.</LD>
<LD>   Some would call the death of Cato a murder; others would call it
an accident. Some would call it a reckless accident. Most people
would consent that Rosenbaum was murdered. Some people would call
what happened in Crown Heights a riot, others would say it was an
occupied territory. There were Jews who called the events a pogrom.</LD>
<TE>   How do you even begin to have a conversation when the terms
themselves are a cause for dispute? And so they should be. After all,
history is made by the way the stories are told, and particularly by
whoever has the power to put the words in print, or some other form
of dissemination. Being a student of language, I was intrigued to
come to Los Angeles, and to work with Davidson and his theater to
create a play about the riots in LA.</TE>
<TE>   "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992" was to be based on interviews, of
which I would perform excerpts in a one-woman show. I was already
aware that I could not start an interview by using the word "riot." I
would ask first to see how the interviewee labeled the "events." It
was variously called, at the time, a "riot," "a "rebellion," an
"uprising," a "revolution." In political circles, where language
tends to be most calculated, it was called the "events of April 29."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after my arrival, two Korean American graduate students at
UCLA contacted me. My heart raced when the conversation began. "We
heard what you are doing, and we are afraid you're going to get it
wrong." Here we go again, I thought to myself.</TE>
<TE>   I have cast myself as an outsider in my artistic life. Labeling my
life's work "On the Road: A Search for American Character," it is my
goal to try to tell stories from multiple points of view, which
involves going out of my "place" to get a point of view other than my
own. It is a passion that I have, born out of my own position as a
girl growing up in segregation. I see the dangers of being relegated
to a "place." For me, the disaster of "placement" is an intellectual
and spiritual disaster. Clearly there are other disasters--being put
in your place can trap you in a social class, wind you up
incarcerated by the blinders of poverty, or wealth for that matter.</TE>
<TE>   I am used to being seen as the outsider who has no business
telling a story that is not my own. But that morning, as I held my
breath in my hotel room with my phone tight to my ear, the sentence
did not end as I expected: "We are afraid you're going to get it
wrong, so we want to help you." These students subsequently took me
around L.A., showing me "their city," sharing with me "their story,"
and introducing me to people who never would have talked to me on
their own. They translated stories; they sat with me across from
interviewees, urging the stories out.</TE>
<TE>   In a fractious society such as ours, who can speak for whom? Who
can author the story? How in the world will we ever author the story
that is big enough to include all of us, or are we only to be a
string of little stories, are we left to be a niche culture? The fact
is, we have to find partners to take us and move us around a variety
of stories.</TE>
<TE>   While in Los Angeles, I came to believe that some of us--not all
of us, but some of us--need to come out of our safe houses of
identity and meet each other in the crossroads of ambiguity. It's not
very safe out in the middle where you dare to cross the line, but it
is creative, it is exciting.</TE>
<TE>   It was Tennessee Williams who gave us the romantic idea of the
"kindness of strangers." In L.A., it was the brilliance of strangers
that I found so compelling.</TE>
<TE>   Twilight Bey is the person for whom "Twilight" is named. He is a
former gang member. I was immediately interested in him because of
the confidence of his stroll. I knew I needed to learn to walk like
that, calmly, no sudden movements, easy, focused and yet light on my
feet. His walk was alert, it was alive, it was awake. It needed to
be. My plan was to walk where I did not belong, to unknown places,
always with the possibility of crossing over a line I did not know
existed. I went from a Beverly Hills real estate agent's office,
decorated down to the tiniest paper clip, to the gang-war torn gym at
Nickerson Gardens. I knew that at any moment I could be crossing a
line that was dangerous to cross. Yet the experience was rich beyond
words.</TE>
<TE>   I interviewed 288 people and performed 46 of those. I have learned
so much by walking in their words over the last 10 years. I know the
real tragedy of the riots, and yet it lives in me as a long poem,
filled with sadness and loss, but nonetheless a long and beautiful
poem, uttered by the residents of your city. The ability of each
interviewee to bring words to what happened was extraordinary.
Everyone was fluent. But does the city remember its fluency now?</TE>
<TE>   Otis Chandler, former publisher of The Times, told me that the
city would forget, that they had said the same thing in the '60s. So
many people said to me in 1992, especially people with
influence--politicians, movie executives:
"We-must-not-let-this-happen-again.
We-must-not-live-in-our-safe-little-worlds-separated-by-the-freeways.
" But, as Chandler warned, they have forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   If the world is to progress, the commitment to do something other
than living in safe little worlds needs to be rehearsed and realized.
This is true whether those little worlds are physical neighborhoods,
races, classes, religions. The riot should not be forgotten. It
should be reviewed. It has valuable information on how to live in the
world, not just in a city. The riot should not be repeated, but in
that brief moment when people were stunned, consciousness was on the
brink of being raised. Yet we are still not awake.</TE>
<TE>   We should not erase the riots from our civic and cultural history.
We should remember it, and wake up to its lessons and move those
lessons into our worldview. We need it at this moment, when a more
alert, wide-awake, aware walk is needed as we move about our lives
and in the world. That should happen not only in schools, but
anywhere that we presume to have influence. When we work in the
world, are we doing so behind a barricade of freeways, classes,
cultures, races, or are we testing the boundaries, taking another
route, crossing over where we don't belong to become more fluent and
to bring more fluency into what we do?</TE>
<TE>   A biologist once said to me that we have no proof that knowledge
will save us, humans, from extinction. We are often satisfied that
life is what we know, about ourselves, our businesses, our families.
But is it possible that our well-being in our cities, in our world,
demands constant exchange, constant movement, constant shifting,
constant transformation.</TE>
<TE>   I ended "Twilight" with the words of Twilight Bey: "In order for
me to be a true human being, I can't forever dwell in darkness, I
can't forever dwell in the idea of just identifying with people like
me and understanding me and mine." There are so many things we can do
to get closer to becoming true human beings. It's not rocket science,
it's not brain surgery, but it should be respected as such.</TE>
<TE>   There are many echoes from the 288 people I interviewed. Last
year, I completed a film version of the play for PBS. I wanted
"Twilight" to be of use for schools after its life on the stage was
over. It occurred to me that people who are about to go to college
now, in the very early years of this century, would have been 8 years
old at the time of the riot. I wanted them to know what happened in
Los Angeles in 1992, and to be able to process it now that they are
old enough to consider what they might like to do in the world.
Perhaps a few among them will dedicate themselves to finding ways to
encourage people to speak, where all conversation has collapsed,
where there are no words, only gunshots.</TE>
<TE>   "Twilight" was screened at USC Law School recently, and I did a
question-and-answer session afterward. At the end, an 18-year-old and
her friend came over to me and thanked me for the film, and said to
me, "I was one of those people who was 8 years old when the riot
happened." It's unrealistic to think that we should celebrate only
the good stories. I could see in this student's eyes that she was
grateful to see this story, a tragic one, unfolded before her.</TE>
<TE>   To have been here in Los Angeles and to have had the privilege of
hearing your story, in the 288 different ways it was told, was a
consciousness-raising experience for me, a profound one. The
contribution of these words to me, a collector of words, was
invaluable. It caused me to think differently not only about my own
art, but about the art of my generation and generations to come. As
an actress, as a writer, is my cause to have the audience look at me,
merely me, or is my cause to have them see something in the world
differently through me?</TE>
<TE>   I would like to change the way we educate artists. I think they
can be critical in this culture and in the world, and that we are a
yet untapped resource. Can we as artists dare to come out of the
safety of our studios, into civic life, to speak in a different
language than politicians and activists? Do we dare ask the public to
trust us to communicate to them about the issues that are serious in
their lives? I have started the Institute on the Arts and Civic
Dialogue to ask that question. The institute ran for three summers at
the end of the 1990s at Harvard, and many artists and some scholars
worked with us, lived with us, dined with us, experimenting with new
ways to connect to audiences and make art about social change.</TE>
<TE>   In this ever-fractious world, artists have a bigger role to play,
as those who not only mirror societies, but those who also bring
things together in a different way. Metaphor is at the root of all
art. Metaphors do just that--they bring together dissimilar entities
and therefore suggest something about each entity. As artists, we are
usually suggesting not so much that one thing is similar to the next,
but that they resound against one another, shedding new light, the
way the sun projects off a white wall.</TE>
<TE>   I had a very special phone call 10 days ago. It was from Twilight,
after whom the play is named. He told me that he felt as though he
was an orphan of the civil rights movement. "Ten years after the
riots, the orphans of the civil rights movement have been betrayed
and lied to again. I expected investment in the community: community
co-ops, community-based businesses and a true investment in the
children. There is a lack of compassion and understanding by those
who control resources. They passed more laws to oppress youth than to
provide resources to build youth up."</TE>
<TE>   When Twilight met me, he had just come from meeting with a group
of youths in a juvenile correctional facility. That morning he had
given them a single word to respond to as a part of an exercise he
does. The response was dramatic. The word elicited tears and a great
deal of passion. I had visions of the room falling apart as he told
me several anecdotes of how the youth responded. The word he had
asked them to respond to was "father."</TE>
<TE>   I think of Twilight as my opposite. We come from entirely
different backgrounds. I am an academic and an artist. He is an
activist and former gang member. He has dark-brown skin, I have light
skin. He is not so tall. I am very tall. And yet sometimes, my
resonance with him makes me think of him more as a twin than as an
opposite. As he talked about the word "father," and how these young
men, many of whom are unfortunately destined to be caught in the
revolving door of the criminal justice system for some time, I
wondered what would happen if Twilight were to come to a class of
mine, in a university, and do his exercise with the educated and, in
most cases, privileged students I teach. How would they respond to
the word "father"?</TE>
<TE>   It would be an education for them and an education for him. What I
am proposing is a back and forth, expanding our realms, looking to
make resonances as a first step toward that world where we save
ourselves from our fractiousness. That's a place where all of us can
start, cross the lines, mix things up, do something to challenge the
idea of what your place is and where you belong.</TE>

<HD>Her Life Caught Up With Her Work</HD>
<DH>A stroke clarified issues painter Katherine Sherwood had
long been exploring.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN EMERLING</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>Katherine Sherwood began painting images of the brain seven years
before suffering her own "brain event," a cerebral hemorrhage in 1997
at the age of 44.</LD>
<LD>   She had also spent years exploring the notion of chance, using
bingo cards in her work as a metaphor for "that moment that can come
into your life and just change you utterly in a second."</LD>
<LD>   A tenured art professor at UC Berkeley, Sherwood even mentored the
department's disabled students, one of whom, a quadriplegic who had
suffered a spinal injury in a diving accident, was her teaching
assistant at the time of her stroke.</LD>
<TE>   Sitting in her home studio, which has been outfitted with a large
low table and a rolling chair to accommodate the fact that she no
longer has use of her right hand and only limited use of her right
leg, she marvels at the degree of synchronicity--or meaningful
coincidences--in her life. "I was dealing with all these things
intellectually," she says. "When I had the stroke, my life caught up
with my art."</TE>
<TE>   Sherwood, who for decades has worn a clump of amulets around her
neck ("they don't work unless they're a gift," she says), was born in
New Orleans. She studied art at UC Davis and the San Francisco Art
Institute, and made installation art in New York's East Village in
the 1980s. In 1989, she headed back to the West Coast when she landed
a teaching job at Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   During her first years here, Sherwood, now 49, began to create a
series of highly researched paintings that combined photolithographs
of medical brain scans and satellite photos. She borrowed apocalyptic
imagery from medieval illuminated manuscripts and talismanic images
of the so-called seals of King Solomon from a 1975 book that
cataloged occult practices in the 17th century.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Sherwood made tenure. With that and a satisfying body of
work finished, the seemingly healthy 44-year-old thought she might
relax awhile. But in May 1997, during a graduate critique, she
collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Sherwood spent six weeks in the hospital and months in bed, able
to get up only a few hours a day. Her husband, painter Jeff Adams,
reorganized their lives and took on sole care of their daughter,
Odette, now 9. It would be half a year before Sherwood the painter
reasserted herself.</TE>
<TE>   "Seven months after I had the stroke, I had to have a cerebral
angiogram," she says. "I was really afraid because one of the side
effects can be that you can have another stroke. Unlike the other
tests I'd done, it didn't show the meat of the brain, it only showed
the arterial system. I got up from the test and there were all these
monitors with these images on them. I thought to myself, they're so
beautiful. They reminded me of Sung dynasty landscape paintings in
China. Right away, I said I need these images."</TE>
<TE>   The beauty of the images was matched by the beauty of the test
results, which showed that she was not in danger of a recurrence.
"The confluence of seeing those images and finding out that I was OK
was very significant."</TE>
<TE>   Although she had insisted she would only resume painting when she
regained the use of her right hand, she went back into the studio and
taught herself to paint with her left hand. Her first task, with the
help of assistants and a reorganized studio, was to "very minimally"
complete the three canvases she had begun before her illness. When
her health insurance ran out, she applied for and received grants,
which paid for more therapy and more assistants to help her in the
studio.</TE>
<TE>   "The act of painting was the best occupational therapy. I was
surprised how much came back in the studio," Sherwood says. She used
the prerogatives of tenure, following her year of sick leave with an
early sabbatical. She reasoned that "I couldn't go back and teach art
without being an artist and making art." During this time, she began
a new body of work that is both an evolution of her earlier work and
a radical departure.</TE>
<TE>   She eliminated the satellite photos and personalized the
neurological imagery, using those angiograms of her brain seen from
the inside out. Gone were literal depictions of chance (the bingo
cards), and tightly scripted compositions.</TE>
<TE>   "I almost never work symmetrically anymore," says Sherwood,
acknowledging her obvious post-stroke asymmetries.</TE>
<TE>   Working much more freely and abstractly than before the stroke,
she has continued to focus on the 17th century talismans, although in
a much less literal way. "I use the seals as a map. I get a direction
that I want to go in and I just follow what feels good." Painting the
seals over the squiggly lines of the angiograms, the physical and the
metaphysical mingle in one visual fabric.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the first new work after the stroke focused on
"Buer," a seal said to cure illness and disease. Like the others,
it's a geometric pattern meant to be used with incantations and
thought to be the magical source of the biblical King Solomon's
riches and power. She also used a seal called "Sallos," which "causes
love between the sexes," a tribute to her husband, whom Sherwood
credits as much as anything with getting her life back on track. The
abstract shapes are set against a yellowish-white background, like
medieval parchment, as if "telescoping in to a certain part of a
manuscript," she says.</TE>
<TE>   One major change in Sherwood's painting is her medium. She gave up
working primarily in oils. "I wanted to detoxify my process as much
as possible after the stroke, so I went from a completely oil process
to a latex and acrylic one. I call it mixed media because I do use
oil in the last layers. That really changed my palette a lot."</TE>
<TE>   She now works with lighter colors that reflect "my exuberance
about painting again," Sherwood says. "Also I tried to use odd
combinations of color, placing very ugly colors--beige and liver
colors--in the mix. They spiced up the surface in ways I couldn't
achieve in using a pastel palette."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to Sherwood about the technical side of her work, you get
the strongest sense of the degree to which this stroke survivor is
better defined as a painter than a patient. Using her left hand,
Sherwood creates the lines of the seal with thick brushes, going over
and over the shapes with different colors. As a flourish, she pours
on the final passes of color.</TE>
<TE>   "I pour the paint very slowly from a distance of just a few
inches," says Sherwood, making a distinction between her technique
and the common references to Jackson Pollock's. In the process, she
discovered that certain colors crack when applied so thickly onto the
surface. She puts a lightly pigmented oil medium over the entire
painting to accentuate the cracking and to give the painting a patina
of age.</TE>
<TE>   Sherwood's most recent work, which will be on view at the Michael
Kohn Gallery from Saturday through June 1, makes use of canvas and
stretcher bars inherited from a friend, painter Wendy Sussman, who
died last year of melanoma. It was Sherwood's way of inviting Sussman
"into my studio to make the work. That was the form my grief took."</TE>
<TE>   In the work for the Kohn Gallery show, she has focused on a seal
called "Gremory," because "it's in the form of a woman. It makes you
beloved by women and that's how Wendy was." She also used "Balam,"
which she says "confers wit, humor and mental ability, because I saw
that as Wendy's wish for all of us."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to using Sussman's canvas, Sherwood also has used a
bit of Sussman's palette. "Wendy was very affectionate toward the
color blue, a medium royal blue which I didn't use before."</TE>
<TE>   In "Sephora," a title taken from Sussman's Hebrew name, Sherwood
mixes a cool palette of different blues, "which was a very awkward
and unknown exercise for me."</TE>
<TE>   Though Sherwood had a long list of exhibitions that preceded her
stroke, the recognition that she has received since--the prestigious
Adaline Kent Award exhibition at the San Francisco Art Institute and
inclusion in the 2000 Whitney Biennial--has been extremely
gratifying. "The biennial was a thrill and I was so delighted that it
came in my life when it did, a couple of years after the stroke. It
was a very affirming situation," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Press attention came along at the same time, including a long
article in the Wall Street Journal that extensively explored the
neurobiological side of her art-making. It hypothesized that the
hemorrhage in the left side of the brain somehow freed her from the
"interpreter," or the portion of the brain that seeks explanation,
releasing a new ease and fluidity into her work.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sherwood appreciates the article, many of her artist
friends disagreed with it because the neuroscientific reasoning gave
her innate creative process short shrift.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, she is very sensitive about the wall text at the entry
to her Adaline Kent Award exhibition, which framed her work in the
context of her stroke, and to critical reactions that did much the
same thing.</TE>
<TE>   "They had wall text when you came in and it announced that I'd had
a stroke, and I felt that a lot of people just projected their own
feelings of sickness and disability onto the paintings," Sherwood
says. "For me, the paintings were completely joyful. They were
celebrating the fact that I was alive. The San Francisco Chronicle
reviewer didn't even describe the paintings, just described the
stroke and compared me to Willem de Kooning. An 84-year-old that has
Alzheimer's is really different from a 44-year-old stroke patient."</TE>
<TE>   Susan Schweik, an English professor at UC Berkeley who is
developing a disabilities studies program there, says this is not an
uncommon way to view the disabled. "There's no doubt Katherine's a
really useful example in how she's physically and creatively handled
her life. These stories, to the extent they've medicalized her, have
reduced her to a certain kind of specimen, rather than seeing her as
an artist involved in many other things."</TE>
<TE>   Next fall, Sherwood will teach a course called "Art, Medicine and
Disability" for Schweik's program. "It will try to locate that
terrain where all three are functioning," Sherwood says. For example,
she will delve back into the lepers and beggars and cripples that
were often the subject of medieval art. "I'm very interested in the
work in Italy that was done before and after the Black Plague. It had
such a conservatizing effect, they reverted to the art that had been
done 500 years before. All of a sudden the figures became much more
iconic, like the life was sucked out of them."</TE>
<TE>   The disability studies program is a good fit at Berkeley, which
has been in the forefront of what's known as the independent living
movement in the U.S.  "At the same time James Meredith was trying to
get into Ole Miss," referring to one of the legends of the civil
rights movement, "Ed Roberts, who used an iron lung, had been
accepted at Berkeley. When they found out about his disability, they
reneged. He and his mother fought it and the university agreed to
admit him and house him in the student hospital."</TE>
<TE>   Out of that grew a city and a university that have mandated
accessible facilities for those with disabilities. Once again,
Sherwood marvels at the synchronicity of her situation. Of all the
places she has lived--New Orleans, San Francisco and New York
City--she says, "can you believe that I became disabled in a place
like Berkeley?"</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Another rush of rock albums, including collections by Sweden's Hives
and Texas' ... And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, highlights
the latest installment of Calendar's guide to keeping up with what's
noteworthy in pop on an album budget of $50 a month.</LD>
<LD>   March</LD>
<LD>   The Hives' "Your New Favourite Band," Poptones import. They're
fresh. They're fun. They're new (to the U.S.). They're Swedish.
They're fab. They're part-Ramones, part-Cheap Trick, part-Beatles
(pre-"Rubber Soul"), part-Rolling Stones (pre-Mick Taylor). They're
cheeky. They're from the same record company strategist (Alan McGee)
who gave us the Jesus and Mary Chain and Oasis. They wear neckties.
They've got cool names (including Howlin' Pelle Almqvist and Chris
Dangerous). They are already big in England. And they're headed our
way (the Roxy on May 27-28). They've got a domestic album ("Vini Vidi
Vicious" on Sire/Burning Heart/Epitaph), but this British import
contains the best of "Vini" plus additional songs and some videos.
Enjoy.</LD>
<TE>   Trail of Dead's "Source Tags &amp; Codes," Interscope. I don't like
phrases like "blown away," but that's how I felt at this Texas
quartet's recent concert at the El Rey Theatre. Purists will demand
you call them by their full name, but I'm just putting Trail of Dead
on my Word program save string because it's shorter. From the same
high-energy, chaos-on-stage-is-good school of rock as the defunct At
the Drive-In, this band combines punk sensibilities with classic rock
craft. "Relative Ways" is a rock anthem worthy of U2. Enjoy.</TE>
<TE>   Norah Jones' "Come Away With Me," Blue Note. It's one thing for a
singer to find the soulful center of a country music classic such as
Hank Williams' "Cold, Cold Heart," which this young Dallas singer
does nicely in this debut package. But the real clincher here is how
she turns John D. Loudermilk's novelty-minded "Turn Me On" into an
expression of sweet seduction and desire. The bonus is that some of
Jones' musical sidekicks crafted classy pop tunes that seem ideal for
her elegant, understated vocal approach.</TE>
<TE>   April</TE>
<TE>   Andrew W.K.'s "I Get Wet," Mercury. Where the Hives woo you with
cleverness, Andrew bars anything arty or subtle from the recording
studio or stage--as you can tell from song titles such as "Party Til
You Puke." This Midwestern singer and songwriter is a throwback to
the rowdy, good-time rock of such forces as KISS, Slade, the early
Beastie Boys and (again) the Ramones. The guy also knows how to
market himself. He's getting press like he was the sixth member of
the Strokes, and that bloody-nose photo on the album cover seems
destined to be a favorite T-shirt image.</TE>
<TE>   Badly Drawn Boy's "About a Boy," ARTISTdirect/XL. From the
gorgeous strings and piano intro to the seductive, "wall of sound"
production touches on the closing "Donna and Blitzen," this is a
knockout--a rare example of a soundtrack holding up outside the film.
For one thing, Damon Gough (a.k.a. Badly Drawn Boy) sings in such a
pleasingly understated style that the tracks would be disarming even
if he weren't also a songwriter in the best modern folk-pop tradition
of Elliott Smith and Ron Sexsmith. In the key songs, Gough yearns for
days to believe in and a love that is unshakable.</TE>
<TE>   Wilco's "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot," Nonesuch. This is likely to be
known for years as the album that the record industry couldn't kill.
After turning the collection in to Reprise last year, the band was
dropped during an executive overhaul at the label. But Nonesuch,
which is also home to such adventurous talents as Emmylou Harris and
Magnetic Fields, came to the rescue. The songs are layered with
stark, foreboding production touches that seem to overshadow the
music itself initially, but the melancholy songs eventually lock in.
In its best moments, "Yankee Hotel" offers a glimpse of the raw
emotional state of disorientation and loss that recalls the
melancholy edge of Neil Young's landmark "Tonight's the Night." A
gem.</TE>

<DH>As California artists plumb new lows, Texans remain true to
the norteno sound.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ricardo Cerda, a burly young Mexican American with a shaved head,
walked into an L.A. recording studio recently and announced he wanted
to be a singer. The kid had moxie but not much else. His voice was so
amateurish it would have quickly gotten him hooted off the stage at
most decent karaoke bars.</LD>
<LD>   Still, Cerda, 17, managed to land a record deal with Sony Discos,
the label that had taken another unpolished homeboy, Lupillo Rivera,
from street to stardom in recent years. Nicknamed "El Gavilan," the
Sparrow Hawk, Cerda released his first album in February. On record,
he remained excruciatingly true to his vocal limitations.</LD>
<LD>   Surprisingly, even to some Sony execs, the album was a hit. Within
days, the label was trumpeting Sparrow Hawk's debut on Billboard's
Hot Latin Tracks chart. Cerda's success spotlights a shocking decline
in the standards for Mexican regional music, which includes the
norteno and banda styles that thrive along the border and have become
so popular in L.A. With dismal voices and sometimes raunchy lyrics,
California's most popular regional acts are trashing the image of a
genre already considered hick music by hip listeners, as corny as
yodeling.</LD>
<TE>   With the exception of established quality acts like Los Tigres del
Norte, California's crass tastes are doing a particular disservice to
the historic norteno style, the accordion-propelled genre with a
respected pedigree, especially in Texas, where the accordion is king.
Music lovers from the Lone Star State are shocked to hear what passes
for norteno music on L.A. airwaves.</TE>
<TE>   Call it the Accordion Curtain--the sharp musical boundary between
the two regions. Someone like Cerda, who records with both banda and
norteno backup, would stand as much of a chance on Texas radio as
Davy Crockett did at the Alamo. Conversely, California audiences
often don't get exposed to Texas norteno artists, such as Michael
Salgado and Intocable, still among the best in the field.</TE>
<TE>   Texas groups are beginning to make inroads here, as evidenced by
the success of Intocable's latest album. These artists are producing
a more refined sound, fusing modern elements while preserving
down-home musicianship worthy of the style that originally inspired
L.A. Chicano stars Los Lobos. World-music fans may recall the
"chicken-skin music" recorded by guitarist Ry Cooder with accordion
ace Flaco Jimenez in the mid-1970s. Today, one of the top accordion
players is young Sunny Sauceda, with the group Vida.</TE>
<TE>   The undisputed legend of the genre is a Texan who is still unknown
to most English-speaking Americans--Ramon Ayala. With his gravelly
voice and tight, accomplished conjunto Los Bravos del Norte (The
Tough Guys of the North), Ayala has set the standard for norteno
music since the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   This month, Ayala released his 100th album, appropriately titled
"El Numero 100," on Freddie Records.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason why artists such as Ramon Ayala have lasted so long
and had such an impact on the industry is not only because the
musicianship is superb, but also the songs are always something
people can relate to," says Freddie Martinez Jr., son of the label's
founder. "He just has an incredible knack for picking solid
material."</TE>
<TE>   Well, that should be welcome news to norteno lovers in L.A. who
have watched the genre deteriorate into crude, profane dissing
matches between rival bands insulting each other with gross lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   How could L.A. music fans, normally demanding of their artists,
fall for such low-brow and off-key efforts as those of Cerda and
others?</TE>
<TE>   "It's not as simple as saying this guy is lame on vocals," says
Adrian Trujillo, director of L.A.'s Moon Studios, where El Gavilan
was discovered, so to speak. "The whole trick is to sound like you
just walked in off the street, took the mike and went at it. You see?
You have to sound like you're not really trying. So people say, 'He
sings terrible, but that could be me.'"</TE>
<TE>   The Cinderfella phenomenon took root on the West Coast thanks
primarily to the slain Chalino Sanchez, another inexperienced singer.
He became a hot commodity in the 1990s with crudely produced songs
about drug-smuggling, known as narcocorridos, which were sold at flea
markets. Sanchez, who was murdered in Sinaloa 10 years ago next
month, was a role model for the younger Rivera and a flock of
imitators.</TE>
<TE>   The unfortunate consequence of their success: Music labels
realized that just about anybody could sell records, sparing them the
expense of searching for real talent and producing quality
recordings. Creatively speaking, the process had sunk to a musical
wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am.</TE>
<TE>   Thankfully, the Ayala tradition of strong songs and skilled
instrumentals is alive and well in Texas, home to some of the top new
norteno bands of the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   On the occasion of Ayala's milestone release, it's fitting to
spotlight a few of the current exponents of a Texas sound that fuses
straight-up norteno with modern Tejano music, the brassy style
popular among young Mexican Americans, such as fans of the late
Selena.</TE>
<TE>   Like Selena before her death, these artists remain relatively
unknown in California. But for anyone who prefers the thrill of an
accomplished accordion or the beauty of clean country harmonies,
these bands are worth a listen.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Salgado, "Sangre de Rey," Sony Discos. This stylish Texan
is known as "El Zurdo de Oro," or the Golden Lefty, for his unusual
left-handed technique of playing the accordion, which he holds
upside-down. His rugged, gravelly vocal emulates Ramon Ayala, who got
his start with the late Cornelia Reyna in another legendary band, Los
Relampagos del Norte.</TE>
<TE>   This album, "Sangre de Rey," which means King's Blood, is a
typical norteno mix of waltzes, corridos and cumbias, plus a
heartbreaker of a mariachi track for variety. Salgado and his
four-piece backup band, which includes his brother Ernie on bajo
sexto guitar and vocal harmony, don't set the bandstand ablaze. But
their cool, tasteful sound goes down as easily as a stroll along the
San Antonio River.</TE>
<TE>   Intocable, "Suenos," EMI Latin. Along with Salgado, this polished
sextet is credited with pioneering the Tejano-norteno fusion that
marked the 1990s. The band's founders, Ricardo Munoz and Rene
Martinez, were born at the right spot for it, in the border town of
Zapata, Texas. It was a point of cultural fusion for the boys, who
started playing together when they were 10 and kept an ear tuned to
Mexican radio. In 1992, they used their savings to make their first
record and were later signed by EMI. From the start, they were driven
by a desire to dress up the genre, doing for norteno what Garth
Brooks did for country.</TE>
<TE>   They've succeeded, perhaps too well, purists might say. This
album, also recorded in San Antonio, seems clearly crafted for a pop
crossover market, with catchy songs and fancy arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   Los Amos de Nuevo Leon, "Complentamente Tuyos," Universal Music
Latino. This group's latest record opens with the shouts of excitable
female fans who happen upon the boys as they arrive at the next tour
stop on a noisy bus. Amid the girls' Spanish chatter, one says in
English: "You guys are bad!" The bilingual dialogue is common in the
Mexican border state of Nuevo Leon and its capital, Monterrey, where
the fusion groups are popular.</TE>
<TE>   The selections dabble broadly in Latin pop, including tunes by
1960s balladeer Leo Dan and the 1990s salsa romantica songwriting ace
Omar Alfanno. This version of Alfanno's "A Puro Dolor," popularized
by Son by Four, may be dispensable. But the album's flashy accordion
is remarkable.</TE>
<TE>   Pesado, "Presente Futuro," WEA Mex. This Monterrey, Mexico, group
is credited with pioneering the romantic trend in norteno music
during the early '90s. Although the group's name means "heavy," a
joking jab at its portly singer and bajo sexto player, the music on
its 13th album remains light pop fare of romance and heartbreak. It's
a popular formula imitated by other new Tejano bands.</TE>
<TE>   Conjunto Primavera, "Ansia de Amar," Fonovisa. Founded in Ojinaga,
Chihuahua, this veteran group has been around for two dozen years and
about as many albums. Here, the players deserve honorable mention on
the strength of their powerful and keenly harmonized vocals alone.
Unlike their unschooled West Coast counterparts, these guys didn't
just walk in off the street singing like this.</TE>

<LD>In Reed Johnson's excellent report on nudity in L.A. theater ("Bare
Truths of Character," April 21), he neglected to mention one of the
more effective and controversial uses of the naked body on the local
stage. I'm referring to Joan Hotchkis' "Elements of Flesh," a solo
performance on aging and sexuality that played at Highways and
throughout the Southland in 1996-97.</LD>
<LD>   The sight of the elegant Hotchkis tastefully posed with bare
buttocks and a coy smile, daring to be sexy at 68 years of age,
flipped people out. The show generated hate mail, newspapers refused
to print the production's ads, and even the beyond-liberal audiences
of Highways called to complain and cancel their memberships. All this
for a funny, insightful, smart, important show that dared posit that
as we age, we need not fear that we'll lose our sexual lives.</LD>

<LD>I found it ironic that Robert Hilburn should write an article on hype
in the music industry ("When You Can Believe the Hype," April 21).
The pop/rock industry has been artistically gutted by profit-driven
hype perpetrated by record companies, radio stations and publications
like yours.</LD>
<LD>   For example, how could you possibly allow an article about Britney
Spears or 'N Sync to appear on anything other than the children's
page? I understand the profit motive; however, what is inexcusable is
the total lack of hype for the very few artists whose talent and
bodies of work deserve it.</LD>
<LD>   A prime case in point is Yes--by all artistic and musical
measuring sticks the greatest rock band of all time. No band can
match the quality and quantity of their compositions, their
instrumental talents, and certainly only a few performers can even
approach the incredible live performances of Yes. And I'm speaking of
what they have done recently. They have been touring brilliantly,
producing new studio music and have released groundbreaking DVDs.</LD>
<TE>   None of this covered by your paper nor other mainstream media.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Wakeman has rejoined Yes, and they are touring this summer.
Yes is, as they always have been, a cutting-edge band. And they have
sold over 40 million records without the hype.</TE>

<LD>Christopher Knight's discussion of the "Mirroring Evil" show at the
Jewish Museum avoids the critic's task ("The Evil That Museums Do,"
April 7). Dismissing a show isn't very helpful to someone who hasn't
seen it. This is the second article this year (the other on healing
and arts) in which he raises good questions only to subvert his
purpose by blowing the argument out of proportion.</LD>
<LD>   Knight may be in a better position to make aesthetic judgments
about the visual life than I am (I teach literature, which may have a
different set of interpretive concerns, although I doubt it). My
experience of "Mirroring" suggests that its audience did grapple with
some important issues. Aside from the fact that I think some of the
works were impressive, and some of the arrangements ingenious, the
show explicitly asks not to be judged in purely conventional artistic
terms.</LD>
<LD>   Whenever one enters the world of figurative language, and
especially when trying to promote a seemingly incongruous
perspective, one risks trivializing one thing or another. Added to
this is the obvious fact that all analogues, "representations" or
even reflections on the Holocaust are precarious. Thus, for example,
I agree that the video material referring to Calvin Klein is
banal--but that made some of the good stuff more effective, in a
surprising way. And surprise is part of this exhibit.</LD>
<TE>   The theory on Holocaust representation or on reflections on
representations is by no means definitive when it comes to figuring
out what is permissible, serious or trivial. While I agree that there
was something self-important about the show, I continue to reflect on
its contents and to discuss it with friends--both those who have seen
it and those who have not. In the case of "Mirroring Evil," Knight
may not appreciate the importance of some of its questions for the
many people who are burdened by Holocaust memory, and still others
who may need to think about the varieties of its dilemmas.</TE>

<LD>Bravo! I applaud Suzanne Muchnic's article "For Black Artists, a New
Champion" (March 31) because it brought much-needed attention to
African American art, a subject The Times has, unfortunately, covered
only sporadically.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Turner's efforts are laudable. He is indeed a "new
champion," but certainly not the first or only champion.</LD>
<LD>   There are many of us who have been endeavoring to focus attention
on the value of African American art and artists for a long time now,
presenting exhibitions in local galleries and museums that similarly
cover the breadth and depth of Turner's initial
presentation--contrary to the article's implication that his is
perhaps unprecedented.</LD>
<TE>   The Heritage, Brockman, Ankrum, M. Hanks and Alitash Kebede Fine
Art Galleries are all venues that have put on fine exhibitions in the
past and present.</TE>
<TE>   In the interest of setting the public record straight, Richard
Mayhew did not, in fact, show his work in Los Angeles for the first
time last year, nor has his market been limited to New York, Detroit
and San Francisco, as stated in the article. Mayhew showed at the
Heritage Gallery in the '70s and had his first one-man show at the
Alitash Kebede Gallery on La Brea in 1994. Indeed, I am the sole
representative of Mayhew's work in Los Angeles and have been showing
it for the past 12 years.</TE>

<TE>   I've been promoting and selling African American art in the Los
Angeles area for 14 years, so when I read Suzanne Muchnic's article I
was surprised and outraged.</TE>
<TE>   The list of statements and assertions by Turner that go
unchallenged by Muchnic is fairly long, but here are a few examples.
The first: Steve Turner is the only hope for African American artists
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The second: Turner's assertion that African American art has had
little visibility in local museums and galleries, and that "there are
a few collectors and few people who sell work by one African American
artist or another, but there isn't the kind of activity that exists
in cities like Detroit or Charlotte, N.C." Huh?</TE>
<TE>   Since 1981 the California African-American Museum has dedicated
itself to putting on numerous exhibitions of African American art and
culture, some of which have been reported by Muchnic in the Los
Angeles Times. The Museum of African American Art has been doing the
same thing since 1975. Both of these fine institutions are in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, since when are Detroit and Charlotte the center of
African American art activity more so than New York, San Francisco,
Chicago and Los Angeles?</TE>
<TE>   Turner and Muchnic are right about one thing though. Barriers
against African Americans still exist. It seems African American art
is a lot more interesting and valuable when someone other than an
African American promotes and sells it.</TE>

<HD>Throwing Dance Into L.A.'s Melting Pot</HD>
<DH>'Spectrum' showcase organizer Deborah Brockus believes in
presenting all styles, from tap to tango.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the photographer tries to capture Deborah Brockus leaping across
the darkened stage of Hollywood's Ivar Theater through a stop-action
strobe light, the metaphor is apt: The tall redhead is a seemingly
endless fount of energy--dancer, choreographer, costume designer,
teacher, founder of Brockus Project Dance Company, master class
organizer and, more recently, concert presenter.</LD>
<LD>   On this occasion Brockus, 40, is rehearsing her new evening-length
work, "Quest," a collaboration with Somei Yoshino Taiko Ensemble, a
one-night performance Brockus will squeeze in before her latest
production, "Spectrum Dance in L.A. #11," bows next Sunday at the
same theater, once home to another type of dance--the striptease.</LD>
<LD>   "Spectrum" was conceived in 1997 as a showcase series to bring
together all genres of dance. Brockus, who was born in Utah and wound
up studying dance and English at UC Irvine, is drawn to ballet,
modern and jazz. She sees Los Angeles as not only a melting pot of
people, but a caldron of dance styles, which is why "Spectrum" shows
include hip-hop, tap, ballroom, Irish, Brazilian, swing, salsa,
folklorico, flamenco, Armenian and tango. Each event averages from 50
to 80 performers in 12 to 16 pieces per evening.</LD>
<TE>   "I love to move and move hard," she says, by way of explaining her
multitasking persona. As for "Spectrum," she says, someone had to do
it.</TE>
<TE>   Her company, which she founded in 1991 after years as a dancer
with Lula Washington Dance Theater and Louise Reichlin and Dancers,
needed more exposure.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a lot of performances, benefits and festivals," she says,
"but one of the stumbling blocks is that performers need to be
stronger--to perform more--and the audience needs to be more
informed. I began 'Spectrum' when I invited a bunch of dancers and
choreographers to present work after I took a look at some of the
local dance series. I figured out what I liked and didn't like. I
vowed not to repeat their mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Among the things Brockus found not to her liking were festivals
that charged performers, bad programming (she limits performance time
to three to 10 minutes), and seeing the same people in show after
show.</TE>
<TE>   "'Spectrum' is free to everyone. My company produces 'Spectrum,'
and we take the risk. Since doing a full concert is very difficult, I
decided to give other people the resources to do shows. I'm
encouraging new work, and there's no audition process. I either know
choreographers' work, or they come recommended and I watch videos.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to have a stylistic balance," she says. "I want all forms
of dance to dance beside each other. Ballet dancers may end up beside
Afro-Haitian dancers who are beside tap, and everybody is seeing each
other's work."</TE>
<TE>   Brockus has made good on her word. Last year she hooked up with
Daisy Kim, a retired classical musician, to co-produce the events,
which, Kim says, barely break even, with tickets from $12 to $20. The
upcoming "Spectrum #11," however, also received the series' first
L.A. County Arts Commission grant. The stipend--$1,500 each for 2002
and 2003, in matching grants--will help Brockus pay for "#11," "#12"
and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Among the dozens of dancers and choreographers appearing in past
"Spectrums" have been Middle Eastern fusion performer Banafsheh
Sayyad, Regina Klenjoski Dance Company, Pat Taylor's JazzAntiqua, the
Ballet Collective and Jamie Nichols' contemporary ensemble Fast Feet.</TE>
<TE>   Nichols won three 2002 Lester Horton Awards, presented by the
Dance Resource Center of Los Angeles, for restaging and reviving her
1998 work "El Trabajo Solo Progresa," for "Spectrum" last year. She
considers Brockus a dance hero.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that's good about 'Spectrum' is that she provides
choreographers, individuals and dance companies an opportunity to
perform in a venue where there's an extremely broad-based audience,"
Nichols says. "That helps those people who ordinarily wouldn't be
going to see a contemporary dance company and might open the doors
for that audience. It's educational and enlightening."</TE>
<TE>   It used to be that Dance Kaleidoscope, Los Angeles' long-running
annual summer showcase, filled the dance presenting gaps. But its
founder, Don Hewitt, retired last year, and Kaleidoscope has been
fading; talks are in progress but it may not happen at all this
summer. That means Brockus is in a position to help keep dance alive
in a town that has been notorious for not nurturing its own.</TE>
<TE>   "Artistically speaking, it's as varied as the artists involved,"
says Renae Williams, grants manager for the L.A. County Arts
Commission. "Some works are gems, some are mediocre, some are being
tried for the first time and might be uneven--but how else would they
know unless they're given the opportunity to show the work? It's a
necessary outlet that definitely serves a purpose."</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody supports each other here; they're in it for the love of
dance," Brockus says. "I'm not consciously trying to fill the gap of
Dance Kaleidoscope, but I think we have something special in L.A. All
of us are smooshed together in this town, and out of all these styles
colliding, there's going to be an L.A. style. I'm already starting to
see it in 'Spectrum.' It's vibrant, it's what's happening in music.
It's the technique of ballet with the depth of modern, the spice and
energy of jazz, and the textures, rhythms and different flavors of
ethnic dance--all blending together."</TE>
<TE>   Brockus admits she has heard that some people think 'Spectrum' is
too commercial. "I don't really care. I think that Alvin Ailey and
David Parsons get similar comments. Hubbard Street Dance Chicago used
to, and none of us knew where Hubbard was trying to go. When you're
creating, you have to deal with what's available at the time."</TE>
<TE>   Brockus is in the midst of expanding 'Spectrum' from two to four
concerts a year (the third and fourth for 2002 are slated for August
and November). Last month, she experimented with a high school
showcase, featuring dancers 12 to 21, and she wants to repeat that
experience. She continues to create dances for her own company, hold
master classes and she will take "Quest" and the five-dancer troupe
to Florida in mid-May.</TE>
<TE>   But there is a lot left on Brockus' to-do list.</TE>
<TE>   "For my own company, I want to tour internationally," she says. "I
would love to have a building where artists are making art, where
people can rehearse. I also would like a theater dedicated to dance.
So many artists in this town need to work. I want to build a strong
dance community in L.A. and profit from it by having great dancers.</TE>
<TE>   "But my first goal is to pay my dancers and get health insurance
so that they can keep dancing. Because dance," she adds, "only really
comes alive when it's on stage. Pieces are born and something happens
on stage that doesn't occur in a studio."</TE>

<DH>Modernist homes are part of the Southland's heritage. So is
the maverick spirit that has led to landmark destruction and feeble
preservation laws.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California has never treated its architectural landmarks
with much respect. Aggressively focused on the future, the region has
always been quick to forget the past. But even by the standards of a
region notorious for its short-term memory, the recent spate of
landmark demolitions is stunning.</LD>
<LD>   In the last year, half a dozen Modernist works have been destroyed
or severely disfigured. Last July, a new owner tore down R.M.
Schindler's 1928 Wolfe House on Catalina Island, a structure that had
figured prominently in the Museum of Contemporary Art's retrospective
on the late Modernist only a few months earlier. A month ago, Richard
Neutra's 1963 Maslon House--one of the architect's last major
works--was demolished in Palm Springs.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, a homeowner ripped out the interior of a 1952 Sullivan
Canyon residence designed by the late Cliff May, considered the
father of the California ranch house. Another homeowner tore off the
facade of a Gregory Ain-designed house at the architect's Mar Vista
development--a historic Modernist community completed in 1949.</LD>
<TE>   And in Palm Springs, the Alpha Beta Food Market (currently a
Ralph's Food 4 Less), designed in 1960 by Modernists Albert Frey,
John Porter Clark and Robson Chambers, is slated for demolition.</TE>
<TE>   Even Los Angeles' most cherished modern landmarks are starting to
look vulnerable. Schindler's 1922 Kings Road House in West
Hollywood--one of the most influential designs of its time--was
recently placed on the World Monuments Fund list of 100 most
endangered sites. Three Frank Lloyd Wright houses in L.A.--the 1920
Barnsdall House, the 1924 Ennis House and the 1924 Freeman
House--stand in various states of decay.</TE>
<TE>   It would seem that if a civilization's maturity is measured, at
least in part, by how it comes to terms with its history, then
Southern California's self-destructive impulses have reached a new
high.</TE>
<TE>   Those impulses, in turn, are facilitated by the almost unchecked
power of the region's homeowners. In Southern California--a
collection of seemingly endlessly expanding real estate
developments--the independent property owner has an almost mythical
status. It is therefore not surprising that cities such as L.A. have
some of the most feeble preservation laws in the country. Of the 88
cities in Los Angeles County, the vast majority have no landmarks
preservation ordinances. In such cases, it is usually left up to a
city's planning department to determine whether a structure has
architectural merit. Usually, that means delaying demolition while
the state completes an environmental impact report. Using the report
as a guide, the planning department can choose whether to preserve
the building.</TE>
<TE>   But planning boards often don't care or know enough to do so. In
the case of the Wolfe House, for example, the current owner, Barry
O'Neil, approached the local Planning Commission last June with a
plan to demolish it, claiming that the previous owner had tried to
restore it but that the process turned out to be too costly. The
commission approved the demolition immediately by a vote of 7-0. In a
perverse acknowledgement of the house's significance, the commission
then signed off on a new design loosely modeled on Schindler's
original, but double the size. A week later, Schindler's masterpiece
was gone forever.</TE>
<TE>   In Palm Springs, the real estate agent who listed the Maslon House
had touted the house as an architectural masterpiece, but once it was
sold, there was nothing to prevent the buyer, Richard Rotenberg, from
tearing it down, which he promptly did. (The former owner could have
attached a preservation easement to the deed, which would have given
an independent landmarks group the power to veto alterations to the
house. Such a tactic is rarely used, however, because it can make a
property more difficult to sell.)</TE>
<TE>   The situation is slightly better in Los Angeles. Even in the case
of a landmarked structure, the city's Cultural Heritage Commission
can halt demolition only for up to 360 days. Typically, during that
time, the city will request a state environmental impact report. It
is then up to the city's planning department to decide whether the
structure merits salvation.</TE>
<TE>   Even with this minimal protection, the outcome is often the same.
In the case of Ain's Mar Vista housing, one owner's actions seemed
particularly ruthless. The development includes three landscaped
streets with 52 L-shaped houses ingeniously laid out to create a
series of communal courts. Several months ago, the majority of the
development's homeowners filed a petition to declare the site a
historic district.</TE>
<TE>   On April 12, the city's Planning Commission began the process of
issuing a temporary prohibition against building permits for the
site. A few days before the prohibition could be enacted, however,
the owner of one of the houses--at 3543 Meier St.--applied for and
received a permit; within days, the front portion of his house had
been demolished.</TE>
<TE>   A similar occurrence took place at May's 1952 Experimental House,
where the city's Cultural Heritage Commission was able to halt a
major renovation only after the original interior had been largely
gutted by the owner.</TE>
<TE>   The Ain house and the May house reveal another key obstacle to
preservationists--the vast number of the city's architectural
masterworks that have yet to be landmarked. According to a recent
report by the Getty Conservation Institute, less than 15% of the city
has been surveyed for historic sites. Even once those sites have been
identified, they must be nominated for landmark status to the
cultural commission. With a full-time staff of two, the commission
often relies on the nonprofit Los Angeles Conservancy to notify it
when a significant architectural work comes under threat.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, New York's Landmarks Commission has a staff of
about 50. What is more, its standards for allowing demolition in New
York City are significantly higher. An owner must prove severe
economic hardship, a rationalization the landmarks commission has
rarely accepted. Nor is there a provision that allows owners to
override the decision of the commission--one of the most powerful in
the country.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the problems run deeper than L.A.'s flimsy regulatory
protections. Ironically, they are a logical byproduct of one of the
city's greatest strengths. For nearly a century, architects such as
Schindler and Neutra flocked here because of the rawness of the
landscape, the relative lack of building codes and restrictions, and
the number of eccentric, maverick clients willing to take a leap into
the unknown. The result was the creation of a wealth of residential
Modernist landmarks unequaled by any other American city.</TE>
<TE>   The same spirit of individualism that made the city a hotbed of
experimentation, however, has also made L.A. a city that seems
oblivious to its own history. What's missing is a strong sense of the
role such structures play in our collective memory. Together, they
are the physical expression of the city's highest ideals, and they
set the standard for our cultural future.</TE>
<TE>   Some already see this.. A growing number of architectural patrons
are investing in the city's historic Modernist homes. Seven years
ago, when movie producer Joel Silver completed a painstaking
restoration of Wright's 1923 Storer house in the Hollywood Hills,
many considered it an extravagance. Since then, such projects have
almost become a trend, at least among those who can afford them.</TE>
<TE>   In Pasadena, the producer David Zander is in the process of
restoring Wright's 1923 Millard House, for example, and fashion
designer Tom Ford recently restored a 1955 Neutra house in Bel-Air.</TE>
<TE>   But ultimately, such patrons are part of a relatively tiny
cultural elite. The majority of homeowners are less enlightened--and
have less money with which to indulge their architectural fantasies.
As such, the implementation of stronger preservation ordinances is
only one of a series of steps needed to prevent such architectural
travesties from reoccurring. More cities will need to provide the
kind of tax and other incentives that would relieve some of the
financial pain associated with rehabilitating historic properties
Cultural institutions like the Getty will have to continue investing
expertise and money when such structures are endangered. And Los
Angeles, in particular, will have to provide its Cultural Heritage
Commission with the staff and resources to monitor and protect the
city's landmarks. Most important of all, cities need to carefully
identify all of those structures that have real historic and
aesthetic value.</TE>
<TE>   The intent, after all, is not to impose the tastes of government
bureaucrats on each and every homeowner. Nor is it to enact laws that
prevent contemporary architects from experimenting with new forms and
structures. It is to save a small but invaluable aspect of the city's
cultural fabric. If, instead, we continue to rely on the public
spiritedness of the average homebuyer, that legacy is clearly doomed.</TE>

<DH>An oral portrait of Stephen Sondheim, on the eve of the
mammoth 'Sondheim Celebration.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK PACHECO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Stephen Sondheim's "Sunday in the Park With George," the
protagonist based on artist Georges Seurat sings, "They have never
understood, and no reason that they should...." Indeed, the
innovative pointillist painter, who died at 31 in 1891, was
controversial and little understood by the art establishment during
his brief but productive life. On the other hand, Sondheim--who, with
librettist-director James Lapine, created the character with whom he
is most closely identified--is widely acknowledged to be the greatest
living theater lyricist-composer. But that understanding continues to
evolve with revivals of his dense, richly textured and challenging
productions, the majority of which neither succeeded commercially on
Broadway nor, for that matter, received unqualified critical praise.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning May 10 and running through the summer, Washington's
Kennedy Center offers an unprecedented look at the composer's canon
in its "Sondheim Celebration," which includes six full revivals in
repertory--"Sweeney Todd," "Company," "Sunday in the Park With
George," "Merrily We Roll Along," "Passion" and "A Little Night
Music"; a "junior" version of "Into the Woods," performed by
schoolchildren; concerts by Barbara Cook and Mandy Patinkin; and
assorted other programs.</LD>
<TE>   Adding to the feeling that everything is coming up Sondheim is the
Broadway opening this week of a revival of "Into the Woods," starring
Vanessa Williams, which played the Ahmanson Theatre earlier this
year. And the Lincoln Center Festival this summer will include the
New National Theatre Tokyo's acclaimed production of "Pacific
Overtures." The Japanese-language revival will then travel to the
Kennedy Center.</TE>
<TE>   "When it came to picking who would direct these productions [in
repertory], the one thing that Stephen said at the beginning was,
'Let's really think about fresh ideas, let's look in all directions
and not go with the usual suspects,'" says Eric Schaeffer, who with
Michael Kaiser, president of the Kennedy Center, is organizing the
festival, and who will be directing "Passion" and "A Little Night
Music." His fellow directors include Christopher Ashley ("Merrily We
Roll Along," "Sweeney Todd"), Mark Brokaw ("A Little Night Music")
and Sean Mathias ("Company"). "From the get-go, [Sondheim] wanted no
remounts."</TE>
<TE>   The roster was in part a result of economic considerations but
mostly reflected the passions of the people involved. "We were
sitting around in his living room in Manhattan, and Michael really
wanted 'Sunday in the Park,' Steve wanted 'Sweeney,' and I wanted
'Passion' and 'A Little Night Music,'" he says. "Merrily We Roll
Along" and "Company" did not require elaborate sets and had not been
revived recently in the United States. One of the last on the list to
be cut was "Anyone Can Whistle," the odd, short-lived 1964 musical
starring Angela Lansbury as an evil mayor. "I think Stephen was a
little disappointed. I think, once again, he thought he'd get another
shot at making the show better."</TE>
<TE>   The chance to get it better is irresistible to any artist but most
especially to Sondheim, who, according to his many collaborators,
often tinkers with even his most successful works, such as "Company,"
"A Little Night Music" and "Sweeney Todd," as well as such problem
children as "Merrily We Roll Along" and "Passion." He will get
another crack at "Assassins" when that work, written with John
Weidman about John Wilkes Booth and others, is revived next season at
New York's Roundabout (it was canceled in the wake of Sept. 11). He
will also get another shot at "Gold!," which, under the title of
"Wise Guys," had an unsuccessful workshop, directed by Sam Mendes,
three years ago. The show, about the pursuit of the American dream by
a pair of rascally brothers, premieres next year at Chicago's Goodman
Theatre, reuniting Sondheim with collaborator Harold Prince after two
decades.</TE>
<TE>   At 72, Sondheim shows no signs of slowing down, acceding to a plea
that in "Sunday in the Park" is directed at George: "Show us more to
see." On the occasion of the "Sondheim Celebration," a host of
collaborators were asked to recall him, and thereby create an oral
collage of Stephen Sondheim, the man and the artist.</TE>
<TE>   "Sweeney Todd"</TE>
<TE>   (May 10-June 30)</TE>
<TE>   Revenge, murder and cannibalism figure in this hilariously macabre
1979 musical melodrama, written by Hugh Wheeler and directed by
Harold Prince. "Sweeney Todd" won eight Tony Awards, including best
musical. Also honored were Len Cariou, in the title role as a wrongly
accused and exiled barber who returns to 19th century London to exact
vengeance for the rape of his wife, and Angela Lansbury as Mrs.
Lovett, his merry accomplice who runs a pie shop and has the clever
idea of turning their victims into meat pies. Critics hailed the
Brechtian social conscience and Broadway showmanship, and the musical
is one of Sondheim's most fully realized and durable hits. For the
festival, Ashley ("The Rocky Horror Show") directs, and Brian Stokes
Mitchell ("Ragtime," "Kiss Me, Kate") and Christine Baranski (TV's
"Cybill") star.</TE>
<TE>   THE SONDHEIM PERSONA</TE>
<TE>   Cariou: Well, he was supremely confident. Anybody who would take
on that material is either supremely confident or out of his mind.
When I heard they were doing this and what it was about, I thought,
"These two guys have lost it, they've gone over the edge." Then I
read Hugh Wheeler's script and thought, "I guess I'm going over the
edge with them."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell: I'd heard that he was really smart, very precise; he
knows what he wants; he knows what he's doing.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley: At the very first meeting with the directors, he put
everybody at ease right away. He said, "Look, I want to be led by you
guys. I want to hear what your responses are to these texts and these
impulses and I want to support that."</TE>
<TE>   Lansbury: The thing I love about Stephen is his absolute wonder
and amazement by a performance, and I always remember him coming
backstage. "Where do you find this person? How do you do this? How do
you place yourself? How do you become that person?" With wonder and
interest he said it. He's so appreciative of the work that actors and
singers do that so contributes to his work.</TE>
<TE>   BEHIND THE MUSIC</TE>
<TE>   Cariou: When we started, I reread the text and there wasn't any
lyrics yet and it was a very dangerous time. I thought, these guys
are really pushing the envelope. I was excited about that. If it
worked, it would be a truly revolutionary piece. When we first heard
the music and how romantic it was, it made great sense. As we worked
on the piece, I was just truly, truly confident it was a masterpiece.</TE>
<TE>   Baranski: This material is stupefyingly difficult and complicated,
and they were the first people doing it. He always goes for the most
challenging; I don't think Steve can do anything else. He can't
confine himself to what is expected. It wouldn't occupy his attention
for 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   STAYING POWER</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell: It has great humor, a social conscience. It seems like
it was one of those rare shows where all the right people come
together at just the right time. I don't think this show will ever
feel old-fashioned; Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein feel
old after a while. It's the most operatic form of musical theater
that I can think of.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley: There is all this talk of the style of "Sweeney Todd": Is
it an opera? Is it a musical? Is it a play with music--what category
does it fall into? What he was working toward in the show is that it
hopefully sets its own rules: not an opera, not a musical. It's its
own genre.</TE>
<TE>   SONDHEIM AS A TEACHER</TE>
<TE>   Ashley: The first read-through day of "Sweeney Todd," he had only
five things to say; many others would have 745,000. He's so selective
about what he wants to put into the process, and he has a blinding
clarity on these matters. He said, "'Sweeney Todd' is better
overacted than underacted." If you ask him, he'll say, "Here's my
opinion but I want you to do what you want to do."</TE>
<TE>   Lansbury: Stephen has always in my career been like a teacher to
me. And he's an extraordinary teacher--not only to seasoned
performers but to young ones. "Try this, try that, don't lose that
word, don't lose that lyric." All of us who've had the benefit of
those teachings have prospered in our careers. If it hadn't been for
those early days, I never would have had the ability to do what I've
done.</TE>
<TE>   Baranski: It takes you awhile to realize how accessible he is as a
person but mostly as a collaborator. He's specific and open to
questions, so grateful, so wanting to support the performers.</TE>
<TE>   Cariou: I remember thinking: Wouldn't it be nice if we heard
sooner from Stephen? But usually he was up to his ears in rewrites.
He was not around a lot, so the interpretation was pretty much done
on our own, with the music director or Hal [Prince]. It was always
something that Stephen would say to you or somebody that would ring a
bell in your head. If you ever asked Stephen about something, or if
he felt you were far off the mark, he could give you chapter and
verse.</TE>
<TE>   THE HERE AND NOW</TE>
<TE>   Lansbury: How has he changed? He's mellowed enormously. He's
become quite benign and charming--he always was, but when he was
young, he was uncomfortable. He was self-conscious. Now he likes to
laugh and to reminisce, and one doesn't have a sense of him as
uncomfortable. He loves gossip, loves hearing about everything in
detail, and then you don't hear from him for six months. But for that
moment, he's yours, and he's lovely. He's an old sock, he has that
sort of warmth and familiarity.</TE>
<TE>   "Company"</TE>
<TE>   (May 17-June 29)</TE>
<TE>   A series of vignettes of married life, this 1970 show established
the collaboration between Sondheim and director Prince as one that
would daringly push the boundaries of the musical-theater form.
Confirmed bachelor Robert (Bobby Bubby) struggles with emotional
commitment, seeing little encouragement in the bickering married
couples who are his friends and who are always thrusting single girls
at him. The sophisticated and urbane musical, with book by George
Furth, explores a vein Sondheim would continue to tap for the next 30
years: the endless yearning for intimacy, the impossibility of
surrender and the wonder of true love. The show won eight Tonys,
including best musical and two for Sondheim (his first). British
director Mathias leads an ensemble headed by Lynn Redgrave as Joanne,
the boozy broad originated by Elaine Stritch, and John Barrowman as
Robert.</TE>
<TE>   THE SHOW'S ORIGINS</TE>
<TE>   Prince: Steve came to me with a play, which his friend George
Furth had written for Sada Thompson. I told him that I couldn't see
Sada running around, changing wigs and costumes, but that I could see
it as a musical about marriage, that I could see these characters
singing but not out of the situations, more out of observation. Steve
gleaned that immediately because he knew that his songs couldn't
sever the tension of George's very taut writing; he couldn't weaken
the tensile strength of each encounter between the characters. And
Steve said, "How about a score in which everything is observed or
commented on by other characters? Or if the characters, after they
finish their scene, sing of their feelings?"</TE>
<TE>   THE SHOW</TE>
<TE>   Stritch: I knew it was mold-breaking, I didn't fully understand it
but I understood it enough. It made emotional sense to me.</TE>
<TE>   SONDHEIM'S INSECURITY</TE>
<TE>   Prince: It's common to anyone who is hugely talented to be very
ruthless with his material because he knows he's got something to
replace it with. If you don't like a song and you have a good reason,
he's not operating from "Ohmigod, how will I replace it?" It doesn't
mean that he doesn't worry himself to death. But deep down, he has
the knowledge that he can come up with something good. When I say to
him--and this goes back forever--about his work, "Is that a good
song?" he'll say, "What do you not like about it?" But every once in
a while he'll say, "Yes, it is." And I say, "Boy, it must be," and
I'll get it.</TE>
<TE>   Stritch: People ask composers, "How do you start?" Steve has said
to me, "I go home and sit down at the piano and try to convince
myself that I'm talented." I told him, "Look if you have any trouble
the next time, would you call me? If my word means anything to you, I
think I can convince you that you are talented."</TE>
<TE>   SELF-CONFIDENCE</TE>
<TE>   Stritch: When I first started to do my current show ["Elaine
Stritch: At Liberty"], I said to him, "I'm so sick of theater, when
am I going to stop getting afraid?" He said, "Don't worried about it,
Elaine; terror works for you." And it does for him too. He doesn't
think he's as talented as we think he is, and I want him to get to
that point before he checks out.</TE>
<TE>   "Sunday in the Park</TE>
<TE>   With George"</TE>
<TE>   (May 31-June 28)</TE>
<TE>   The 1984 Pulitzer Prize-winning musical studied the crises of
creativity over nearly a century and two continents, the first act
dealing with Seurat and the creation of his masterpiece "Sunday
Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte." It marked the first
collaboration between Sondheim and director-librettist Lapine. Some
have suggested that the musical was the composer's response to the
critical lambasting of his previous musical, "Merrily We Roll Along."
Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters starred in the original
production, which, much to the dismay of Sondheim enthusiasts, lost
the best musical Tony to "La Cage aux Folles." "Sondheim Celebration"
artistic director Eric Schaeffer ("Putting It Together") directs Raul
Esparza ("Cabaret") and Melissa Errico ("My Fair Lady") in the
Kennedy Center production.</TE>
<TE>   CHARACTER IDENTIFICATION</TE>
<TE>   Schaeffer: I think he identifies with George; he realizes the
frustration of no one understanding, of trying to do something new,
trying to break a mold and people don't embrace it because you failed
as an artist, or the audience failed to open its eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Esparza: He writes about life as complicated as it gets. He
struggles every day to put something unnameable and unwriteable into
these pieces. There's a lyric that's from the writings of Seurat: "I
was trying to get through to something new, something of my own."
George didn't have any other option: "I can only paint my way of
painting, in my own voice."</TE>
<TE>   THE MYSTIQUE</TE>
<TE>   Schaeffer: He's totally aware of how people perceive him to be
unapproachable. At the first meeting of the directors, he said, "I
hope I don't scare any of these people off. They won't ask me
questions if they really have them. I hope they won't find me scary."
It's almost like he beats himself up about it.</TE>
<TE>   "Merrily We Roll Along"</TE>
<TE>   (July 12-August 24)</TE>
<TE>   One of Sondheim's most problematic musicals, this 1981 adaptation
of a George Kaufman-Moss Hart play traced the trajectory of a
friendship backward in time, beginning with its destruction under the
weight of cynical compromise and moral failure, and ending in the
full flush of youthful hope and idealism. The show, with book by
Furth and directed by Prince, scathingly indicted the American dream
and the shallowness of show business. Despite a cast of eager young
unknowns, including Lonny Price as Charley, and a score considered to
be one of Sondheim's best, "Merrily" earned few fans and closed
quickly. In fact, embittered by the critical and disdainful response,
Sondheim threatened to leave the theater altogether and ended his
collaboration with Prince for the next two decades. In Washington,
Esparza, Michael Hayden and Miriam Shor play the ambitious friends
under Ashley's direction.</TE>
<TE>   SONDHEIM, THE MENTOR</TE>
<TE>   Price: I started writing to him when I was 14, and he wrote back.
Later, I sent him a show that I'd written with Jim Walton [co-star of
"Merrily"], and he wrote us back and took a great deal of time. He
was very specific with his criticism and very encouraging. I think
the idea of musical theater continuing as an art form has been a huge
focus of his life. I can tell you of a lot of young composers who got
letters from him. They sent them on Monday, and on Friday, there'd be
a response in the mail.</TE>
<TE>   COLLABORATING</TE>
<TE>   Price: The thing about Steve is that he always treats you with the
utmost respect. If you give him an argument that makes sense, then
he's very for it. Even on "Merrily," which I did when I was in my
20s, he was writing a song for me ["Franklin Shepard Inc."], and he
came in and apologized and said, "What I've given you isn't right
yet, but just try to work with it." He was concerned he'd let me
down.</TE>
<TE>   SONDHEIM AND THE AUDIENCE</TE>
<TE>   Prince: It's one of his best scores. The problem is the structure
and telling the story backward. I don't think you can do a thing
about it. I know Steve feels that if they'd only left us alone until
we opened, it would have been a flawed but valuable musical, and it
would have had a run. I think he's probably right. But we had had a
long decade of being well-received, and we stumbled.</TE>
<TE>   Price: We were all devastated by the response, not just the
critical response, but the attitude of the response. It seemed kind
of nasty, like they were out to get Hal and Steve. There was this
anger at the piece, not just that they didn't like what we'd done,
but they were angry at Hal and Steve. The score got the best of the
reviews, but I think Steve just felt that he'd let us down.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley: "Merrily" has a lot more hurdles and challenges than his
other shows to keep an audience involved, and I think he's aware of
those pitfalls. He realizes there's a difficulty about that piece.
It's not more or less interesting, just more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Price: He very much cares about the audience. He wants them to be
challenged but entertained at the same time. I think younger
composers are less intent on audiences, their vision and their
concept is so important that they forget about the audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Passion"</TE>
<TE>   (July 19-Aug. 23)</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, the groundbreaking Sondheim-Lapine collaboration
continued with the adaptation of an obscure Italian movie set in a
remote military post in Italy. Giorgio, a newly transferred captain,
encounters the ugly, ailing spinster Fosca, the cousin of his
superior officer. Fosca immediately becomes obsessed with the
handsome, literate and kind officer. But he is repelled by her, all
the more so because he has left behind the lovely Clara, his married
mistress.</TE>
<TE>   "Passion," with its dark, unsettling themes of fixation and the
failings of the flesh, had a tempestuous preview period in New York
(audiences hooted openly at Fosca) and the critical reaction was
tepid, although the haunting score was praised, as was Donna Murphy's
performance as the tragic Fosca. With Disney's "Beauty and the Beast"
the only real competition, the show captured the 1994 best musical
Tony. In the revival, directed by Schaeffer, Judy Kuhn and Rebecca
Luker play, respectively, the dark and light poles, Fosca and Clara,
in the life of Giorgio, played by Michael Cerveris.</TE>
<TE>   HAVING FUN</TE>
<TE>   Murphy: I remember one night, after a really difficult audience, I
came offstage and Steve was standing in the stairwell, and he said,
"Are you having fun?" Here was this man I respect as a serious artist
saying, "Are you having any fun?" I said, "I love the work, but I
don't know if I'm having any fun." And he said, "You must have fun;
you must experience the joy in this work because these experiences
are few and far between, and it's a real loss if you waste the
opportunity to find the joy in them." And coming from someone who I
know to work with such intensity, I knew I couldn't take that
lightly. That's stayed with me for a long time.</TE>
<TE>   REHEARSALS</TE>
<TE>   Schaeffer: In rehearsal one day, he was very aware of how his
watching people work makes them tense. He said to me, "Have me in the
room when you're OK about having people on the spot." He's aware that
the actors are not relaxed with him in the room. And it's part of his
being supportive and in contact with me about when to put that extra
pressure on people and where to take it off, and then he'll walk away
and be someplace else.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy: One night, I knew that Sondheim was sending through the
fax a new song for me--"Loving You"--that I would sing in the train
scene. And as it was coming through, page by page, in Stephen's hand,
I was reading it, weeping. He had left this voicemail message: "I've
written this. I don't know if it's any good." And I went and played
it on the piano, and it was devastatingly beautiful. I remember
covering my mouth, shaking my head, tears streaming down my face. I
called him immediately. He said, "Good, Donna; I'm glad you like it."</TE>
<TE>   "A Little Night Music"</TE>
<TE>   (Aug. 2-25)</TE>
<TE>   An unqualified smash in 1973, winner of eight Tonys, including
best musical, "A Little Night Music" stands alongside "A Funny Thing
Happened on the Way to the Forum," "Company" and "Sweeney Todd" as
among the most cherished in the Sondheim canon. Based on an Ingmar
Bergman film, the musical, written by Hugh Wheeler, tells of the
romantic foibles of a group of 19th century Swedes. It centers on the
ravishing actress Desiree Armfeldt and her ex-lover Fredrik, newly
married to a young bride. Prince directed the original, which starred
Glynis Johns and Len Cariou. Those roles will be played by Blair
Brown and John Dossett in the Kennedy production directed by Mark
Brokaw.</TE>
<TE>   "SEND IN THE CLOWNS"</TE>
<TE>   Cariou: That song was originally meant for my character, Fredrik,
not for Desiree Armfeldt, who was played by Glynis Johns. But a month
into rehearsal, our characters had changed, and our relationship took
a different turn. Steve had been unable to write the song for me for
that scene. He kept apologizing to me. So we called him in and Steve
saw how the scenes had changed. He went home and two days
later--literally--he came back, sat down at the piano and played
"Send in the Clowns," the most famous song he's ever written. So now
it was Glynis' song. I was disappointed. But you can't be too
bitterly disappointed because it's such a wonderful moment.</TE>
<TE>   "THE MILLER'S SON"</TE>
<TE>   Prince: You're talking about the class system, about being buried
alive in that kind of society, and you're talking about the dreams
that people have. You see the young girl with all the possibilities
and conviction that she has and it's quite an astonishing thing.
That's what he does, he manages to infuse these songs with layers.
You don't hear all the layers until you've heard the song a third or
fourth time.</TE>
<TE>   SONDHEIM UNDER PRESSURE</TE>
<TE>   Cariou: When we got to Boston, we were about seven-eighths there.
I remember Stephen couldn't sleep. He loves to work in the night,
like some kind of vampire, between midnight and the morning, and of
course, nobody else does that, so he's up all the time. So he
inevitably gets ill because he doesn't sleep. He looks like hell,
like somebody beat him up on the street, just awful. And then he sits
down and plays this beautiful music. I don't get it, but I'll take
this.</TE>
<TE>   Prince: He keeps telling me, "Pressure me, pressure me," and I
will, but that can be debilitating. He's known for working under
pressure, famously.</TE>
<TE>   Schaeffer: He'll say, "That's a fair criticism, a fair critic. I
learned something from that." He always wants to learn.</TE>
<TE>   LOOKING BACK, LOOKING AHEAD</TE>
<TE>   Prince: I think that we have a good time, and it's been 21 years
since we worked together, and everybody's tried to analyze the hell
out of it. We just took a vacation, and it took a lot longer than
either of us would've imagined.</TE>
<TE>   What we have, we got back instantly when we started to work
together on "Gold!" I wondered why he wanted to do it, what was the
pull, and in many, many conversations with him and John Weidman,
another show emerged and they threw away the show they'd been working
on. We have a good time. And one of the things that we both said to
my wife, at some point: We both feel incredibly young again. After
all, we started out working when we were very young, and the give and
take and enthusiasm, the energy that comes from one of us suggesting
something to the other. It's palpable, huge and very nourishing. We
seem like a couple of boys again.</TE>

<LD>The Recording Artists Coalition's fight against the seven-year
contract statute and the music business' losing battle against
downloading may get the headlines. But to thousands of musicians,
there's an urgent issue that could prove the catalyst for organizing
into a cohesive body: health insurance.</LD>
<LD>   That's the belief of Jenny Toomey, an independent musician and
executive director of the Washington-based Future of Music Coalition.</LD>
<LD>   "A few years ago, the National Endowment for the Arts tried to
substantiate how badly artists were living," she says. "They looked
at incomes of nine different categories of artists."</LD>
<TE>   "Dancers were lowest and musicians just above," she continues.
"Median income for musicians was $30,000 a year, and those are people
working two jobs to meet household expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "They're cash-poor and time-poor, so it's not surprising that
they're not easy to organize. But activism teaches that you start
with what people need, and musicians need health insurance."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Toomey--who in addition to being an artist (her
double-CD "Antidote" was released recently) ran the Simple Machines
label for eight years--is spearheading a project to research
musicians' insurance needs.</TE>
<TE>   She's conducting a survey to get the ball rolling. Interested
musicians can participate in the confidential venture via the
coalition's Web site at
www.futureofmusic.org/research/healthsurvey.cfm.</TE>
<TE>   More than 2,500 musicians have already filled out the survey, but
Toomey is hoping many more will, especially those without insurance
coverage. The coalition is also working with a clinical psychologist
researching health issues associated with musicians--such as hearing
loss, substance abuse and the effects of grueling tour schedules.</TE>
<TE>   Toomey acknowledges that insurance is available for many musicians
via two unions, the American Federation of Television &amp; Radio
Artists, with most record companies contracted to pay first-year fees
for all signed artists, and the American Federation of Musicians.</TE>
<TE>   But many other musicians don't qualify for membership in either
union, while others choose not to join.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always told my musician clients when they sign a deal to
go join the musicians' union so they can get insurance," says Michael
Ackerman, a Los Angeles attorney who represents independent and
major-label acts as well as independent record companies. "Few have
joined. I think a lot of them aren't really aware of it or think that
the union isn't for them."</TE>
<TE>   The Future of Music effort is picking up support from various
quarters, including two organizations involved in artists' rights
issues--the Recording Artists Coalition and United Musicians, the
distribution channel for independent releases formed by Aimee Mann,
Michael Penn and manager Michael Hausman.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a universal issue that affects all musicians," RAC President
Don Henley says. "I have every confidence in Jenny and her
organization. We'll be working with her to determine the answers to
these questions. We'll be providing if not all the funding [for the
survey], then a substantial portion of it. It will cost about
$100,000--a bargain."</TE>
<TE>   Says Hausman, "Fortunately, most of the artists I work with have
insurance through AFTRA. If you work enough, you can get that. But
it's frustrating that musicians not getting the right work can't get
those benefits, and it's great that Jenny is trying to sort it out."</TE>
<TE>   FAMILY BUSINESS: Perhaps Anna Waronker was destined to go into the
business end of music. The former singer of That Dog is the daughter
of DreamWorks Records executive and former Warner Bros. Records
President Lenny Waronker, whose father, Si, owned the old Liberty
Records label. But rather than team up with her dad, Anna Waronker
has partnered with her sister-in-law--Go-Go's guitarist Charlotte
Caffey--to start a new label.</TE>
<TE>   Called Five Foot Two Records (for their height), the label will be
distributed by independent Oglio Records and will debut in early
summer with Waronker's first solo album, which features some
Waronker-Chaffey collaborations.</TE>
<TE>   "I've observed the music business from almost every angle," says
Waronker, 29. "And with Charlotte going out with the Go-Go's again in
recent years, we came to the conclusion that we had to be in control
of our own fate."</TE>
<TE>   Waronker and Caffey are related by their marriages to,
respectively, Steve and Jeff McDonald of Redd Kross. "It really is
family," says Caffey, 48. "Anna and I started writing together and it
was so easy it was scary." Caffey says she had been getting bored by
new music she was hearing, but found herself excited by Waronker's
demo recordings, as well as some she heard by Kim Shattuck of the
band the Muffs. She realized this music would not be a comfortable
fit in the major-label world.</TE>
<TE>   Plans include a re-release of Redd Kross' "Neurotica" album, a new
Muffs album and, in 2003, to mark her 50th birthday, Caffey is hoping
to compile a collection of unreleased songs from her 25 years of
songwriting.</TE>
<TE>   And yes, Waronker did go to her father for advice about starting
the label. He was very supportive, but not on the same wavelength.
"He said, 'Well, do you have any hits?'" she says. "I said, 'No.' He
said, 'Do you have $10 million?' 'No.' And then I realized that we
were in different worlds."</TE>
<TE>   BRONCO BUSTER: Football player Trevor Pryce, the all-pro defensive
tackle of the Denver Broncos, is going into the music business--but
trying to avoid being a cliche. Rather than making a glorified vanity
album as a rapper, as many athletes have done, he's launching his
independent Outlook Music Co. label with a May 28 release by
Wilkesboro, N.C.-based band Roman Candle.</TE>
<TE>   The album, "Says Pop," is not hip-hop at all, but
singer-songwriter rock with electronic beats. Pryce is planning to
make a trip-hop-style album, but says his primary interest is to
build a label with a strong, independent base that will serve as his
career after his playing days are through.</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: After last year's "Timeless" tribute to Hank Williams
on Lost Highway won the country album Grammy, MCA Nashville is
planning a tribute to Patsy Cline with a similarly eclectic--though
all female--lineup. Two tracks have been recorded so far: jazz singer
Diana Krall on "Crazy" and longtime Cline acolyte k.d. lang
contributing "Leavin' on Your Mind." The album is due in the fall
....</TE>
<TE>   Michael Penn and Aimee Mann are planning several special
performances of their Acoustic Vaudeville concerts to be recorded for
a live album. The shows will take place most likely in late May in
Hollywood (exact dates and location to be determined), with a select
number of tickets to be sold via the Web site of their United
Musicians company, www.unitedmusicians.com....</TE>
<TE>   L.A. musician-producer the Angel is designing a Web area for
Sony's Screenblast (www.screenblast.com). Called Digital Soundclash
With the Angel, the site will feature music tutorials, remix and
editing tools, and feedback and advice from the Angel on tracks
submitted by users.... Sweden's A Teens, who started as an ABBA cover
act, have now tackled Elvis Presley, with a version of "Can't Help
Falling in Love." It will be the first single from the group's new
album, "Pop Till You Drop," due June 18, and will also be heard on
the soundtrack for the Disney film "Lilo &amp; Stitch." ... Exene
Cervenka's new band, Original Sinners, has finished a debut album,
due June 25 on Offspring singer Dexter Holland's Nitro Records label.
The band features guitarists Sam Soto and Jason Edge, and former
Distillers bassist Kim Chi and drummer Mat Young.</TE>

<HD>Trey Anastasio's Solo Debut Is Pretty Phishy</HD>

<LD>   TREY ANASTASIO</LD>
<LD>   "Trey Anastasio"</LD>
<TE>   Elektra</TE>
<TE>   Phish fans would likely follow band leader Anastasio
anywhere--after all, they went for last year's messy experiments with
his Oysterhead collaboration with Les Claypool and Stewart Copeland.
He takes them to a few new places on this solo debut (due in stores
Tuesday), breaking from his regular band's rock quartet format by
employing a horn section, some Afro-Caribbean rhythms and full
orchestrations in a few places.</TE>
<TE>   With the African percolation of the 11-minute workout "Last Tube,"
he transcends the basic jam formula with a solid groove, although
he's no Paul Simon or David Byrne, let alone Fela Kuti. On another
front, two instrumentals showcase his guitarist and arranger skills;
the lovely "At the Gazebo" is the highlight, milking genteel Southern
brass for an idyllic chamber vibe.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the album is marked throughout by familiar Phish
characteristics: breezy whimsy in words and melodies, unassuming but
not commanding singing, and organic ensemble playing featuring
Anastasio's fluid guitar solos. Such songs as the opening "Alive
Again" merely sound like Phish with horns, while the
tropical-flavored "Cayman Review" could almost pass for a Glenn Frey
frat-party tune. Faring better are "Mr. Completely," mixing punchy
playing and a sunny, psychedelic aura, and the low-key ballads "Flock
of Words" and "Ray Dawn Balloon."</TE>
<TE>   All in all, this should satisfy Phish fans looking for a fix
during the band's current hiatus--if a second set of six full Phish
concert recordings also being released now isn't enough. But the new
tricks aren't likely to make any converts.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Hochman</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   THE PROMISE RING</TE>
<TE>   "Wood/Water"</TE>
<TE>   Anti</TE>
<TE>   Indie rock hasn't always been so warm and fuzzy. But the Promise
Ring is like that, stepping ever further from its emo-core roots and
into something a lot more early Beach Boys than Fugazi. On
"Wood/Water," the Milwaukee rock quintet aims for sophisticated pop
from the dark side, neither about screaming life nor navel-gazing.
The angst here is real and manageable.</TE>
<TE>   Recorded in England with producer Stephen Street (Blur,
Morrissey), the album follows a two-year layoff while
singer-guitarist Davey von Bohlen recovered from a noncancerous brain
tumor. The result is a kind of earnest melancholy, focused mainly on
romance and small human struggles, as Von Bohlen sings, "I'm just
happy you stuck around" in a voice both fragile and intimate.</TE>
<TE>   His raspy, distorted vocals are set against upbeat guitar pop on
"Size of Your Life" and the light and breezy "Wake Up April." There
are occasional flourishes of slide guitar, while "Say Goodbye Good"
brings things to an epic peak with a gospel flavor and spacey effects
that could have been lifted from the Steve Miller Band.</TE>
<TE>   The Promise Ring does blow up with crashing guitars once or twice,
but the overall feel remains muffled and downhearted, with all those
rough edges still sounding like the beating of a broken heart.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Appleford</TE>
<TE>   ***1/2</TE>
<TE>   MARACA</TE>
<TE>   "Tremenda Rumba!"</TE>
<TE>   Ahi-Nama</TE>
<TE>   Cuban music, like Cuba itself, has people divided into often
conflicting camps. There's the traditional Buena Vista contingent.
The progressive timba wing of groups such as Los Van Van. The rootsy
rumba regiment led by Munequitos de Matanzas. And Irakere's vanguard
of Latin jazz.</TE>
<TE>   On his accomplished new album, flutist Orlando Valle, nicknamed
"Maraca," makes a remarkably effective attempt at pulling these
diverse musical forces together. By inviting top musicians from
various genres to join his core band, Otra Vision (Another Vision),
Maraca offers a sweeping portrait of contemporary Cuban dance music,
as colorful and lively (and occasionally busy) as the mural art
commissioned for the cover.</TE>
<TE>   Don't let the title (which translates as "terrific party") mislead
you. This is far from a folkloric album, although Havana's acclaimed
rumba group Yoruba Andabo is featured prominently on a few fiery
tracks. Maraca's music is mostly modern, upbeat and danceable, always
executed with the skilled musicianship you'd expect of this veteran
of the seminal Irakere.</TE>
<TE>   In its desire to please all tastes, this fusion seems overly
commercial at times, as with its catchy but simplistic coros (choral
refrains). Yet in throwing up a big musical tent, Maraca shows how
universally inviting Cuban music can be if everybody just tried to
get along.</TE>
<TE>   --Agustin Gurza</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   *** C-Murder, "Tru Dawgs," D3. Doubling as the New Orleans
rapper's fifth album as well as the first compilation he's
spearheaded, this gritty, 17-cut collection features C-Murder (who's
awaiting trial in Louisiana on second-degree murder charges) and a
host of friends delivering a strong batch of street-based narratives.
Guest Snoop Dogg flows like a gangster godfather on the sublime
"Dogged Her Out," while Mia X mixes partying with sex on the bouncy
"They Wanna Pay for It." C-Murder and his "Dawgs" have plenty of
bite.</TE>
<TE>   --Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   *** Quarashi, "Jinx," Time Bomb/Columbia. Not everything from
Iceland is arty Bjork or airy Sigur Ros. Straight outta Reykjavik
comes a foursome evoking Rage Against the Machine and Cypress Hill.
The ensemble rapping on this U.S. debut is enthusiastically
old-school boasting in the Beastie Boys and Run-DMC style ("I'm not
even from America / But I will bury ya'" goes one line), but they
freshen it with wit and substance (they name-check Euripides!) and
some solid, even sweet singing. And on "Tarfur," they rap in
Icelandic.</TE>
<TE>   --S.H.</TE>
<TE>   *** Fine China, "You Make Me Hate Music," Tooth &amp; Nail. Funny
where 1980s Great Britain shows up these days. Amid melancholic
guitar sweeps and perhaps an overdose of breathiness, this
Phoenix-based foursome constructs improbably blithesome anthems full
of Smiths echoes and delivered at the pace of "Out of Time"-era
R.E.M. Next thing you know, the London Bridge will materialize in the
middle of the desert.</TE>

<LD>   DAVID BERKMAN</LD>
<LD>   "Leaving Home"</LD>
<TE>   Palmetto</TE>
<TE>   The world of jazz does not lack for fine emerging pianists, but
Berkman stands apart from the pack, not only for the intelligence of
his playing, but also for his direction of an unusually effective
sextet. In his third recording for Palmetto, Berkman presides over
elegant, evocative arrangements that are performed with control and
craft. The sheer ingenuity of the reed writing on a track titled
"Creepy," the sustained elegiac mood of "Forever Astor" and the
intricate counterpoint on "Unchained Harmony" are typical of an album
that brings new ideas to every track. As pianist, Berkman doesn't
waste a note, focusing instead on unusual voicings, idiosyncratic
chord structures and a telling, deep-into-the-keys approach. As
bandleader, he has crafted nearly ideal expressive vehicles for tenor
saxophonist Chris Cheek, alto saxophonist Dick Oatts and soprano
saxophonist Sam Newsome. With a first-rate rhythm section of bassist
Ugonna Okegwo and drummer Brian Blade, this ensemble enhances the
impact of already strong compositions.</TE>
<TE>   ***1/2</TE>
<TE>   THE DUTCH JAZZ ORCHESTRA</TE>
<TE>   "Strayhorn and Standards:</TE>
<TE>   You Go to My Head"</TE>
<TE>   Challenge</TE>
<TE>   The full measure of composer Billy Strayhorn's genius has yet to
be taken, but this radiant recording can only deepen one's
appreciation for his gifts. Surveying Strayhorn orchestrations of
standard tunes, the Dutch Jazz Orchestra unfurls one revelatory
reading after another, from the shimmering horns of "Autumn in New
York" to the sumptuous colors of "Where or When" (with Marjorie
Barnes' exquisitely tasteful vocals). Exactly how Strayhorn attained
such ethereal, translucent orchestral effects in "The Man I Love" or
conveyed such profound blues expression in "I Don't Stand a Ghost of
a Chance" will be debated for a long time. Yet perhaps it's
sufficient simply to savor his achievements, as in the extraordinary
sensuality on "You Go to My Head" and the glistening instrumental
details on "I'll Buy That Dream." All of these tunes are
idiomatically performed by the Dutch Jazz Orchestra, which, under the
alert direction of Jerry Van Rooijen, is among the most accomplished
large jazz ensembles.</TE>
<TE>   ***1/2</TE>
<TE>   NAFTULE'S DREAM</TE>
<TE>   "Job"</TE>
<TE>   Tzadik</TE>
<TE>   Naftule's Dream may be the only ensemble on the planet that merges
jazz, blues, klezmer, classical, avant-garde and a hint of heavy
metal--and does so seamlessly. Granted, only the most adventurous
ears will respond to its fearless brand of genre-bending. But brave
listeners will find it difficult to resist the sonic joyride of "Back
in the Sewer," a track that opens as a free-form improvisation and
segues into Old World klezmer before erupting into ferocious,
blues-inspired electric guitar blasts. Or consider the title track, a
haunting lament in which clarinetist Glenn Dickson spins exquisite,
minor-key arabesques that underscore the enduring power of classic
klezmer melody. On "Industrial Bulgar," the band turns vintage, dance
rhythms inside out with surprising tempo shifts; and on two
miniatures by Erik Satie, the musicians find the place where French
lyricism, Eastern European harmony and jazz rhythm converge.</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   ALLEN SAVEDOFF</TE>
<TE>   "Contradiction"</TE>
<TE>   Capstone</TE>
<TE>   Jazz contrabassoonists never have been exactly in high demand, but
that hasn't stopped Savedoff from releasing a thoroughly charming
recording on which he defies the presumed limitations of the
instrument. Bringing a touch of humor to practically every track, he
swings buoyantly on a whimsical merger of Leonard Bernstein's waltz
"I Feel Pretty" and James Brown's famous shout "I Feel Good" to come
up with "I Feel Pretty Good." The idea may sound farfetched, but the
combination of Kim Scharnberg's witty arrangement and Savedoff's
double-reed virtuosity produces a carefree music that can't help but
make the listener smile. Great music-making doesn't always have to be
deadly serious, a point that Savedoff makes with nearly every joyous
phrase he plays.</TE>

<LD>In two weeks, the movers and shakers of the international film world
will gather in the South of France for the Cannes Film Festival.
Although Cannes is the world's biggest, most prestigious
international film event, it is by no means the only one. As this
excerpt from Kenneth Turan's "Sundance to Sarajevo: Film Festivals
and the World They Made" (published this month by the University of
California Press) makes clear, the festival universe is an especially
wide-ranging and surprising one where one size definitely does not
fit all.</LD>
<LD>   No one wants to speak against the Bible, but the sentiment in
Ecclesiastes famously insisting "to every thing there is a season,
and a time to every purpose under heaven" in no way applies to the
universe of film festivals.</LD>
<LD>   Month in, month out, from the Flickfest International Outdoor
Short Film Festival starting in early January in the Bondi Beach area
of Sydney, Australia, through the Autrans Festival of Mountain and
Adventure films ending in mid-December in the high, thin air of
southeast France, there is barely a day on the international calendar
where some film festival is not being celebrated in some exotic city
somewhere in the world.</LD>
<TE>   Haugesund, Norway, Oulu, Finland and Umea, Sweden, have festivals,
as does Trencianske Teplice in the Slovak Republic, India's
Thiruvananathapuram, Iran's Kish Island ("the pearl of the Persian
Gulf"), the Australia beach resort of Noosa and the Italian city of
Udine, which unexpectedly bills itself as "the world's largest
showcase of popular East Asian cinema." There are nearly 60 Jewish
film festivals in existence but only one QT event, in which director
Quentin Tarantino annually takes over the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in
Austin, Texas, and shows favorite films to benefit the Austin Film
Society.</TE>
<TE>   There is even an intentionally stateless movable feast called
Transfest which facilitates "the simple idea of introducing film
festivals which take place somewhere in the world, in another place."
Festivals have become such a growth industry that Missoula, Mont.,
has two and a petite but trendy town like Telluride, Colo., now has
three (MountainFilm Festival and IndieFest 2K in addition to the
regular Telluride event). And, especially in Europe, various
coordinating bodies have grown up to try to create order out of the
impending chaos.</TE>
<TE>   On the largest scale, the European Coordination of Film Festivals,
created to remedy "the disparity of practices and some dangerous
excesses and trends" of the continent's proliferating fests, listed
76 festivals when it began in 1995 and had more than doubled to 154
in 20 countries by 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Even with all these official bodies, no one seems to be exactly
sure how many festivals there are in the world, not even books
created specifically to keep track of them. "The Variety Guide to
Film Festivals" by Steven Gaydos lists more than 400, while three
other books ("International Film Festival Guide" by Shael Stolberg,
"The Film Festival Guide" by Adam Langer and "The Ultimate Film
Festival Survival Guide" by Chris Gore) record over 500 each.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, film festivals are especially a growth area in
the United States. So much so that critic David Thomson, in an arch
list in Movieline magazine titled "100 Questions We Honestly Want to
Ask Hollywood" ("What is Tom Cruise going to do instead of aging?"
"Why do they make the new James Bond films seem as if they were made
in 1962?") found space to wonder, "Can anyone name five cities in
America that do not now have film festivals?"</TE>
<TE>   This proliferation is visible across the board. While New York,
ever the cultural behemoth, hosts an estimated 30 festivals (the
wildest being the New York Underground Film Festival, annually home
to questionable items like "Home Brewer Serial Killer" and "Farley
Mowat Ate My Brother"), North Carolina boasts 13, including something
called the Hi Mom Film Festival in Chapel Hill.</TE>
<TE>   It's one thing for just about every city within cheering distance
of Los Angeles (Palm Beach, Malibu, Idyllwild, Temecula, San Luis
Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Monica, Santa Clarita, the Silver Lake
neighborhood proper and the surfside trio of Newport Beach, Laguna
Beach and Hermosa Beach) to have a festival, it's another to witness
a similar proliferation in the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   Garry Trudeau astutely gave a nod to this fest-mania in his
"Doonesbury" comic strip by having B.D.'s actress wife, Boopsie, the
star of "Chugalug," "Beerblasters" and "Pompom Pam," be the subject
of the Barbara Ann Boopstein Film Festival, sponsored by the Aspen
Ski Patrol and highlighted by, she is pleased to report, "a panel
discussion of my film work! Led by Roger Ebert!"</TE>
<TE>   Even a Boopstein festival doesn't seem out of place when
considering some of the stranger names on the festival circuit,
events so outlandish they sound apocryphal even if they're not. What
is one to make of items with names like the Takoma Tortured Artists
Film Festival in Washington state; Eat My Shorts! Comedy Short Film
Showcase in Montreal, Canada; Eat My Schlock! Home Grown Trash Film
Festival in Brisbane, Australia; Short Attention Span Film and Video
Festival in San Francisco, not to mention another San Francisco
event, the Brainwash Movie Festival, whose top prize is said to be
the "Charles Manson Loose Eyeball" award.</TE>
<TE>   As a Brooklyn boy, I was first exposed to the always serious New
York Film Festival, which began in 1963 and included in its first
five years classics like Roman Polanski's "Knife in the Water," Milos
Foreman's "Loves of a Blonde," Gillo Pontecorvo's "The Battle of
Algiers," Bernardo Bertolucci's "Before the Revolution," and an
explosion of films from Jean-Luc Godard: "Band A Part," "Une Femme
Est Une Femme," "Alphaville" and "Masculine Feminine."</TE>
<TE>   Not that I had the means to actually see all these films; it's the
feeling of festivity and potential I remember from my younger days,
the excitement of the full-page ad announcing the event's selections,
written up in stirring prose, that appeared every year, one time
only, in exactly the same format in the Sunday Arts and Leisure
section of the New York Times. I felt, as I have not always felt
since, the sense of a door opening into a world of culture and
sophistication I had no idea existed, as well as the hope that there
might be a place in there for me.</TE>
<TE>   That feeling was only part of what I experienced in 1971 during my
first trip to a major world cinema event, representing the Washington
Post at the Cannes Film Festival in the exotic (to me, at least)
south of France. Mostly I was exhausted, deluged by more movies more
often than I wanted to handle.</TE>
<TE>   As naive as I was young, I confided these thoughts to the storied
Italian director Luchino Visconti, one of the masters of cinema, who
was doing interviews to promote his "Death In Venice." "Isn't it a
bit overwhelming?" I said to the great man, whose vibrant argyle
socks I still remember. Visconti turned his hawk-like, aristocratic
face, features suitable for a 15th century condotierre, to me in
shock. "It is cinema, cinema, cinema, all the day long," he said,
restating the obvious for my benefit. "I love it."</TE>
<TE>   From that time to this, I have struggled to have Visconti's
enthusiastic attitude toward festivals, but it has not been uniformly
easy. Though they are often held in pleasant, diverting cities, too
many theaters, too many deadlines, too large crowds, too much
relentless hype and too few memorable films can make these events
more of an exasperating ordeal than might be imagined for a working
reporter or critic.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, paradoxically, it was the enormous number of cinematic
celebrations overloading the world circuit that reinvigorated my
interest in film festivals. I was intrigued by how many there were,
how they styled themselves and in what unexpected corners of the
globe they appeared. I began acquiring brochures and pamphlets from
events that caught my interest and soon I had a serious enough
collection, if not for a doctoral thesis, at least for some broad
general observations.</TE>
<TE>   Given that there are so many of them, the key thing these multiple
festivals share is a need to differentiate themselves from each
other.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the boast is straightforward, if a bit narrow, like
Neuchatel's claim to be "the only Swiss film festival devoted to the
bizarre and the imagination," Toronto's Rendezvous with Madness and
its focus on the myth and reality of mental illness, or the
Rencontres Internationales Henri Langlois in Poitiers, France, which
concentrates on film school projects, annually choosing some 60
examples from approximately 3,000 short and medium-length works
nominated by 140 schools.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes a festival's unifying concept is completely unexpected.
The Golden Knight Slavonic Film Festival in the Ukrainian city of
Kiev focuses on Slav brotherhood and Orthodox Christian values.
Copenhagen's Night Film Festival annual sells 40,000 tickets despite
screening all its films between midnight and 6 a.m., while, at the
opposite end of the spectrum, Italy's International Giffoni
Children's Film Festival recruits kids to discuss films with their
directors and stars.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally the fit between subject and locale is so good that
the synergy creates an international institution. Dinard, a town in
France's Brittany, became so identified with its Festival of British
Cinema that it placed a giant replica of the event's trophy, director
Alfred Hitchcock with a bird on each shoulder, on the local
boardwalk. And Cognac's devotion to thrillers and suspense films
means that festival guests are politely fingerprinted in the town
square and served brandy and orange juice cocktails before
screenings.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, both Nantucket ("Where Screenwriters Inherit
the Earth") and Austin ("King of the Screenplay Festivals") have made
names for themselves focusing on the underappreciated writer, with
the Texas festival handing out what it calls "the coveted (and
lethally heavy) Austin Film Festival Typewriter Award." Perhaps the
oddest corner of the festival universe is the one for films that
other events have scoffed at. Roger Ebert uses the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to host an Overlooked Film Festival, and
one of the several festivals at home in Santa Monica is called Dances
With Films, which insists its entries must have no known actors,
producers or directors or, for that matter, no money from any known
company.</TE>
<TE>   Besides coming up with surprising concepts, festivals can also set
themselves apart by the nature of the prize they give competitors. No
two festivals hand out the same award, though after taking account of
things like the Golden Raven (Brussels), the Golden Frog (Torun,
Poland), the Golden Calf (Utrecht), the Golden Olive (Kalamata,
Greece), the Golden Orange (Antalya, Turkey), the Golden Bayard
(Namur, France), the Golden Boomerang (Noosa), the Golden Alexander
(Thessaloniki) and the Golden Anchor (Haifa), it does seem there is
no object, either natural or man-made, that has not been gilded for
presentation.</TE>
<TE>   As to why so many festivals are flowering here and now, the
reasons are several fold, starting with the desire of the
municipalities that host them to get their name before a wide public
and attract visitors both during and after the celebration in
question.</TE>
<TE>   The key cause of festival proliferation, however, is a
symbiotically linked trio of factors. Newly active independent and
foreign-language filmmakers hunger for appreciative audiences, a need
that dovetails nicely with audience members hungry for alternatives
to the standard Hollywood fare that dominates film screens not only
in this country but worldwide. And small distributors as well as
national film industries locked into an unequal battle with the
American juggernaut see these hungers as a not-to-be-missed
opportunity to both earn money and promote their goods to the fullest
extent.</TE>
<TE>   For while movie fans have not lost their taste for the artistic
and non-commercial, theaters are not always willing to risk showing
those films.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course there are too many festivals," Pierre Henry Deleau,
former head of Cannes' Directors Fortnight told Daily Variety.
"People are going to them because theaters aren't doing their jobs to
show films from the rest of the world."</TE>
<TE>   Festivals have become, in effect, what Piers Handling, head of the
powerful Toronto Film Festival, has called "an alternative
distribution network. A lot of work only gets shown now at festivals.
A lot of foreign-language film that would get distribution ten years
ago doesn't get seen anymore."</TE>
<TE>   France has been especially assiduous in using festivals around the
world to get its cinema seen, and it's impossible to imagine the
current critical rage for Iranian films without the intense exposure
these works have gotten at Cannes, New York and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The festivals I've enjoyed most not only show films, they serve as
picture windows onto a wider, more diverse world and cinema's place
in it. Sometimes, as with Sarajevo and Havana, film is a vehicle for
trying to understand the international political community's most
vexing dilemmas. Sometimes, as with Burkina Faso' s FESPACO and
Pordenone's Giornate del Cinema Muto, it's a chance to examine the
very nature of the cinematic experience. For different reasons and at
different times, each of these festivals has made me feel the sense
of excitement that lit up Luchino Visconti's face all those many
years.</TE>

<HD>'Little People Floundering' From Executive Life Losses</HD>
<DH>While the legal process drags on, many policyholders must
contend with sharply reduced annuity payments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 10 years after the failure of California's Executive Life
Insurance Co., many of its policyholders, some of them elderly and
disabled, are struggling to get by on monthly annuity payments that
are 30% to 50% less than what they had been promised by the once
highly rated insurer.</LD>
<LD>   The 1991 insolvency, then the nation's largest insurance failure,
served as a catalyst for stricter controls on insurance company
investments. But the regulations came too late for Executive Life's
thousands of policyholders, some of whom lost homes or were forced
out of retirement because of the loss of income when policy values
were slashed.</LD>
<LD>   Policyholders blame those losses on the terms of the 1992 sale of
Executive Life's "junk" bond portfolio to a French investor group for
$3.25 billion. They contend that the portfolio was worth much more
because the junk, or high-yield, bond market was rapidly recovering.</LD>
<TE>   The deal "left all the little people floundering," said Dru Ann
Jacobsen, whose 74-year-old mother lost her home after her annuity
payments were cut to $1,800 a month from the $3,000 she had been
guaranteed for life.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say the investor group was a front for French bank
Credit Lyonnais, which circumvented state and federal laws to buy the
bonds. In what has been called "the deal of the century," authorities
say the bank and its partners made a profit of at least $2billion
after the value of the junk bond portfolio rose.</TE>
<TE>   The Executive Life deal triggered a wave of litigation, with no
quick end in sight. Discovery began months ago in a suit by the state
insurance commissioner, but no trial date has been set.</TE>
<TE>   In a hearing last week on the merits of a state attorney general's
suit seeking $6 billion in damages, U.S. District Judge A. Howard
Matz gave the impression he was inclined to agree with arguments that
the insurance commissioner has exclusive standing to represent
policyholders in such actions.</TE>
<TE>   Also last week, a U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel cited
the insurance commissioner's standing and ruled out one of two suits
policyholders had filed in the case.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit has yet to rule on a second policyholders' suit
that names the French investors and former Insurance Commissioner
John Garamendi, who seized Executive Life and oversaw the sale of its
assets. In that suit, policyholders argue that the California
insurance commissioner's office cannot be trusted to represent their
interests because of Garamendi's alleged bungling of the Executive
Life sale.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the successor to Executive Life could face criminal
prosecution. Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles recommended a year
ago that Credit Lyonnais be prosecuted in the deal. That decision is
pending at the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   The Executive Life debacle has become a morass of insurance and
banking laws and complex international investment deals. Lost in all
the legal battles is the fact that thousands of policyholders are out
billions of dollars. A central point of dispute is whether their
losses are the result of the crash of the junk bond market or the
terms of the assets sale.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Credit Lyonnais blame the policyholders' losses on
Executive Life's investment in risky junk bonds, which plummeted in
value in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Garamendi shares that view. He said he struck the best deal he
could in the sale of the company's assets. Half of Executive Life's
junk bonds were in default, and the bond sale proceeds infused the
successor insurance company with badly needed cash, said Garamendi,
who is running for insurance commissioner again after a failed 1994
bid for governor and a stint in the private sector.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the junk of the junk bonds," he said. "This was the
trash. To say the market had recovered is one thing--even though it
had not recovered at the time. But to say these bonds would follow
the market is fallacious."</TE>
<TE>   Garamendi said he pursued the sale to what he believed was a group
of French investors to minimize the risk of additional losses. The
Insurance Department, he said, did not have the expertise or the cash
necessary to hold the bonds and sell them over time in the hopes of
realizing a better return.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a whole lot of foolishness to believe the Insurance
Department should have kept those junk bonds," Garamendi said.</TE>
<TE>   But that is exactly what policyholders believe.</TE>
<TE>   "Had they not sold to the French, had they backed off and put it
out to bid again, the policyholders would have gotten 100% on their
dollars," said Tom Schaefer, a San Diego lawyer who represents
policyholders. "In a recovered bond market, there would be no reason
to restructure the policies downward."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Allegations Point at Credit Lyonnais</TE>
<TE>   Policyholders were so sure the sale was a bad deal that a group of
them went to court at the time to try to stop it. Then, six years
after the sale, a whistle-blower's disclosure reopened the
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   The whistle-blower alleged that the French investor group was a
front for Credit Lyonnais, which was then controlled by the French
government.</TE>
<TE>   That brought the scrutiny of state and federal prosecutors.
California law prohibits foreign governments from owning insurance
companies, and federal law at the time banned banks from being in the
insurance business.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles investigated and
recommended last April that Credit Lyonnais be charged with fraud and
conspiracy. Justice Department officials have met with lawyers for
the French bank, who contend that Credit Lyonnais should not face
prosecution for its efforts to rescue an insurance company that made
questionable investments.</TE>
<TE>   Of 333,000 policies in effect at the time Executive Life was sold,
5,600 were structured settlement annuities that still are held by
disabled victims of accidents and malpractice and for whom the
monthly payments are a primary source of income, said Maureen Marr,
an advocate for the group.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Dixon, Jacobsen's mother, is one of them. She followed her
lawyer's advice and converted a $2.5-million settlement for injuries
from a car collision into the annuity that was supposed to pay her
$3,000 a month. She did not believe she was making a risky
investment.</TE>
<TE>   "The lawyers elected to put it into this 'Triple A Executive
Life,'" Jacobsen said. "They said, 'This is the safest thing we can
put it in.... It's rated high, excellent, A-No. 1."</TE>
<TE>   But after Executive Life was sold, Dixon's monthly payments were
slashed to $1,800.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Injury Settlement Was Chance to Keep House</TE>
<TE>   She said the loss compounded the hardship she had endured since
the 1979 accident in which her van was struck head-on by a drunk
driver. She was driving home with daughter Darian, then 19, after a
trip to buy tap shoes for a class they had hoped to take together.</TE>
<TE>   Both women were badly injured. Dixon's hips and pelvis were
shattered, and her right leg was so badly crushed it had to be
amputated at the hip. Doctors wanted to take her left leg as well.</TE>
<TE>   "I just couldn't face that," Dixon said. "At least it's there. I
just can't put any weight on it. So I'm in a wheelchair."</TE>
<TE>   Her marriage broke up in the wake of the accident, and her
finances were a shambles.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement of an injury lawsuit provided Dixon with the hope
that she could remain in the Malibu ranch home she had lived in for
30 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a mansion on the beach," she said. "But it was a
beautiful house with a beautiful view."</TE>
<TE>   For a while, Dixon managed. But after her annuity payments were
cut by $1,200 a month, the bills mounted. Dixon refinanced her home
several times, rolling her debt into the mortgage. Then it became
difficult for her to make the mortgage payments.</TE>
<TE>   "We just kept refinancing and refinancing and hoping we could pull
it off," Jacobsen said. "But finally it got too much. It was taking
the whole [annuity] payment. She didn't have anything left for
anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon sold her house almost two years ago and moved into a
two-bedroom mobile home near Jacobsen and her family.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobsen has helped care for her mother since the accident,
lifting her in and out of the wheelchair countless times, a loving
but back-breaking task. If the annuity were paid in full, Jacobsen
said, the family would buy a van with a chair lift and hire an aide
to help care for Dixon.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that she's getting older, she needs more help, and we can't
do it," Jacobsen said. "I don't think they expected her to live this
long."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to structured-settlement policyholders such as Dixon,
the Executive Life debacle resulted in losses to holders of life
insurance policies and guaranteed investment contracts, investments
similar to certificates of deposit.</TE>
<TE>   Although state insurance guaranty funds made up part of the
losses, coverage in California was capped at $100,000 per annuity and
$300,000 per life insurance policy, said Gary Fontana, a San
Francisco lawyer who was hired by the insurance commissioner's office
to handle its suit.</TE>
<TE>   The structured-settlement policyholders "tended to have the bigger
policies," said Marr, the group's advocate. "And the bigger your

<TE>   Thousands Lost Money Needed for Medical Care</TE>
<TE>   Vince and Sue Watson believe that their severely disabled
daughter, Katie, 21, has lost more than $1million in annuity
payments, not including interest.</TE>
<TE>   The Watsons hope the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reinstates
the second policyholders' suit, viewing it as their best chance to
recover their losses, which would pay for their daughter's stay in a
full-care facility should she outlive them.</TE>
<TE>   "Our case has been so fragmented over so many years that a lot of
people don't realize that over $4.6 billion was lost by people like
Katie, who are sick or crippled," Vince Watson said. "There are
thousands of people who lost money that was needed for medical care,
for financing their retirement, or that they had invested to secure
their families' future."</TE>
<TE>   Katie Watson's disabilities stem from lapses in her hospital care
when, at 21 months old, she was admitted with a mild case of
pneumonia.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened at the hospital was a tragedy of errors--the wrong
medicine, oxygen ordered but not given, blood gases not monitored, a
whole series of things," Vince Watson said.</TE>
<TE>   The ordeal left Katie Watson severely brain damaged, unable to
walk or feed herself and in need of full-time, round-the-clock care.</TE>
<TE>   The Watsons sued the hospital and used their settlement for the
down payment on a home they had built with special lifts, wheelchair
ramps and other amenities for their daughter's care.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement of a separate suit on Katie Watson's behalf was
intended to fully cover the cost of her care for life and was
invested in an Executive Life annuity. The monthly payments were to
increase 5% each year to keep up with inflation.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the payments, which were $13,000 a month, were cut to
$5,000. Fearing they could not make the mortgage payments and pay for
their daughter's care, the Watsons, both of whom work, immediately
put the home on the market.</TE>
<TE>   But in a depressed market, they found no buyers for the unique
home. The bank foreclosed, and the Watsons, who have six other
children, moved out.</TE>
<TE>   Katie Watson's monthly payments, with the 5% increases, have grown
to $10,000 today, still far short of what had been promised.</TE>
<TE>   "If anything happened to Susie and I, there's still not enough
money coming in on a monthly basis to get Katie in a full-care
facility," Vince Watson said. "We're still kind of holding our breath
about whether ... if anything happened, Katie would be taken care
of."</TE>

<HD>Water Is Creating Stir as Business Investment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jean-Marie Messier, Vivendi Universal's chief executive, reversed
himself last week and told shareholders that the company would retain
its 63% ownership of Vivendi Environnement, one of the largest water
service companies in the world.</LD>
<LD>   That could be a smart move. Water is shaping up as a very
attractive business as worldwide needs for water and for treatment
and purification are bringing forth a new global industry.</LD>
<LD>   French political objections reportedly dissuaded Messier, who had
intended to reduce his company's stake in Vivendi's water subsidiary.
But he also might have noticed that big investors and major companies
are rushing to invest in water.</LD>
<TE>   Recognition is dawning among international experts, businesspeople
and investors that water availability is becoming a major question in
many areas. In the Middle East, water is an underlying factor in
tensions among Syria, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., Virginia, Maryland, Georgia and Florida are among
neighboring states quarreling over water rights. Disputes between
Mexico and California over Colorado River water could block a
water-supply deal for San Diego. Congress is proposing legislation on
resource planning and quality standards for water. The drought-ridden
Northeastern states are examining water management programs that
California pioneered in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   The Environmental Protection Agency and municipal utility groups
agree that more than $500billion of investment in U.S. water and
sewer infrastructure will be needed in the next 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   The rising concerns add up to a global business with $300 billion
in annual revenue that is growing 10% a year. It's an industry
dominated thus far by two French companies and a German company. The
French firms are Vivendi Environnement--which owns U.S. Filter of
Palm Desert--and Suez, the old canal company that merged decades ago
with Lyonnaise des Eaux. Germany's RWE, an energy and water
conglomerate, is buying American Water Works Co., a large Voorhees,
N.J.-based water utility.</TE>
<TE>   General Electric Co., which bought a water treatment company in
February, looks upon the water business as a "global growth
platform," says Debra Coy, water industry analyst at Schwab Capital
Markets in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But water is too critical, too governed by politics, ancient
rights and passions to be an easy business.</TE>
<TE>   For example, investors in the Delta Wetlands Project, who have a
plan to store water on islands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta,
have been working for 15 years to get permits and the process still
is complete, says Fiona Hutton, a water expert and consultant to
Delta Wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   The delay flies in the face of California's need for additional
water storage as insurance against drought years, because the state
loses rights to 16% of its current annual take from the Colorado
River to neighboring Nevada, Arizona and Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The main driver of business at present is the need for cities to
repair and modernize their water systems, after years of postponed
maintenance, to comply with water quality regulations. U.S. Filter,
the U.S. operation of Vivendi Environnement, has just won a 20-year
contract worth $1billion to manage the water supply of Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis finds it economical to outsource water management
because U.S. Filter can upgrade and operate water treatment
facilities efficiently and keep up with changing environmental
regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a business that requires long-term contracts so that private
companies can recover costs of investments," explains Andrew Seidel,
president of U.S. Filter.</TE>
<TE>   If very large expenditures are necessary to completely replace an
aged water system, the city would raise the necessary funds at low
interest by selling tax-exempt municipal bonds.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Filter is negotiating with Stockton for a waste-water
management and recycling contract. Suez has just received contract
extensions for work on the water systems of Burbank and Hoboken, N.J.
And RWE is in the process of paying $7.2 billion for American Water
Works, which owns water supply companies in 22 states.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Early Start Gives European Firms an Edge</TE>
<TE>   European companies dominate the global water industry because they
started earlier with a different pattern from the U.S. system, which
made water supply a task for municipal governments.</TE>
<TE>   In 1853, Generale des Eaux, an irrigation company that now is
Vivendi Environnement, obtained a contract to manage water for the
city of Paris. Later, the company managed water for Venice, Italy;
Istanbul, Turkey; and Oporto, Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Vivendi paid $6billion to acquire U.S. Filter, a firm
that Coachella Valley entrepreneur Richard Heckmann had built by
consolidating pump and filtration firms and water-service companies.</TE>
<TE>   The industry remains fragmented, but the next few years will see
more mergers of equipment firms and service companies, such as Pall
Corp. of East Hills, N.Y., and San Jose-based California Water
Service Group, says analyst Coy of Schwab Capital.</TE>
<TE>   Water availability is becoming a pressing issue. California
requires proof of water availability before a housing project can
break ground. And electronics plants must assure themselves of
supplies of very pure water and waste-water treatment facilities to
handle their effluent.</TE>
<TE>   Also, California and the Western states are used to cycles of
drought every seven years or so. Now the Northeast, in its second
year of scant rainfall, is thinking about drought cycles too. Such
cycles create a demand for water storage.</TE>
<TE>   It was a drought period a decade ago that got California thinking
about more storage and developing markets for water transfer. The
result is that the Metropolitan Water District, which serves most of
Southern California, increased storage at sites such as Diamond
Valley Lake Reservoir in Riverside County. It also began work on a
pricing system for transferring surplus water from farms to urban and
industrial areas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Water Storage Seen as Business Opportunity</TE>
<TE>   To Los Angeles businessman Danny Villanueva, the situation is
ideal for investment in storage facilities, which can collect water
in wet years to be released in dry years. Villanueva, head of Bastion
Capital, a venture capital firm that has had success in backing
Spanish-language radio and television, is examining sites for storage
facilities in many areas of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Villanueva aims to invest $10million to $30million of his family's
money in water storage in the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a long-term business, not like electricity where you can
throw up a power plant, but a permanent business and a vital need,"
Villanueva says.</TE>
<TE>   Water also can be a very slow and frustrating business, because
the substance is critical and regulation is pervasive. Santa
Monica-based Cadiz Inc. and the MWD have been trying for many years
to reach agreement and get approvals for a water storage facility in
the Mojave Desert.</TE>
<TE>   Michael George, president of Point Richmond, Calif.-based Western
Water Co., has been trying for four years to get a permit to transfer
agricultural water, which his company controls, to the city of San
Diego. But different state water resources authorities have yet to
agree on terms and permits for the deal, George says.</TE>
<TE>   He says the permitting process is moving somewhat faster in
Colorado, where Western Water bought ranchland with water rights and
is applying to transfer water to the city of Denver. .</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is that increasing value and long-term business
growth are perhaps more certain in water than in the entertainment
industry that Vivendi Universal's Messier seems to prefer.</TE>

<LD>I can't believe that I just purchased a $15,000 high-definition
television screen that is about to become a dinosaur due to a new
digital connection standard ["HDTV Device Gains Support," April 17].
I feel like such a fool to think that all HDTV technical issues had
been addressed.</LD>
<LD>   I seriously doubt that I will be junking my equipment to support a
new standard driven by copyright paranoia. I guess I will miss out on
all of that "new" entertainment.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I see the consumer electronics industry has bowed to pressure from
the major movie studios to implement a digital system in all HDTVs or
digital televisions to not only limit the recording of programming
off the air but to add a pay-per-quality feature for programs
provided in high definition.</TE>
<TE>   I am one of those "early adopters" who bought an RCA HD set-top
box about two years ago. I have been an enthusiastic supporter of
HDTV and tried to convince others how fantastic HD looks. I was
looking forward to HD DVDs, VCRs and affordable large flat-screen
displays based on DLP technology.</TE>
<TE>   But if the industry goes ahead with this ill-thought-out scheme to
put these odious restrictions on HDTV, I will not buy any more
equipment and I will tell others not to either.</TE>
<TE>   May this scheme go the way of the ill-fated Divx DVD, which was
also a stupid idea based on greed.</TE>

<HD>Nurse Pay Rewards Lack of Commitment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a registered nurse for 20 years, I have seen the cycles of extra
money as well as lack of staffing [Hospitals Seek Cures for Nurses
Shortage," April 21].</LD>
<LD>   During all this one thing is consistent: Business administration
is never willing to pay their own nurses what they pay for traveling,
or registry nurses.</LD>
<LD>   That tells me that the business decision makers are not seeing the
clear picture: Obviously there do exist nurses willing to make the
extra money. Why commit to something if you can get paid twice as
much for the same work, plus better benefits?</LD>
<TE>   I'm sure the hospital was paying more for the traveling nurse than
its own nurse featured in your article. That tells me that even
though she has a lot of respect for what she does for a living, her
employers do not.</TE>
<TE>   That to me is the main problem with the nursing shortage, and
until that changes, it will never go away.</TE>
<TE>   Deirdre Apablasa, R.N.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A major factor in what has become a shift in focus for running
hospitals is that it has become a corporation's money-making
enterprise. The corporate entities emphasize earnings and stock
performance foremost, and attention to quality care and employee
satisfaction are mere footnotes.</TE>
<TE>   The corporations gladly cash in on the expensive health-care
industry, yet balk when employees, those who make their success
possible, ask for fairness and equity.</TE>
<TE>   It is because of this that the nursing shortage is, at least,
aggravated, because the profession is reduced to a very unattractive
state for those who would otherwise consider joining the field.</TE>

future and the future of the many less numerous, less crowded and,
presumably, happier generations to follow.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: You've written before about how important it is to protect
your Social Security number to prevent identity theft. But it seems
like every form I fill out these days asks for my number. When do I
have to reveal my number, and when can I keep it to myself?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: If taxes or credit decisions are involved, you'll usually
need to divulge your Social Security number. That means it can be
required by employers, banks and brokerages, as well as certain
government agencies, such as tax, welfare and motor vehicles
departments.</LD>
<LD>   You'll also have to give out your number if you're applying for
credit, asking for a copy of your credit report or opting out of
credit solicitations via the credit bureaus' (888) 5 OPT OUT number.</LD>
<TE>   In most other cases, you should refuse to divulge it. Just leave
that part of the form blank. If you're challenged, ask whether the
business or agency will accept another form of identification. Be
polite, but firm, and appeal to a supervisor if you get an
uncooperative "that's our policy" response from a front-line worker.</TE>
<TE>   Social Security numbers were never intended to be a catch-all
personal identification number for the business world, and yet that
is what they have become.</TE>
<TE>   Given the growth of identity theft, consumers need to start
fighting back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   File Electronically If You Want Expedited Refund</TE>
<TE>   Q: When I have to pay taxes, federal and state tax authorities
usually cash my check within a week. This year I was owed refunds and
it took more than seven weeks for the checks to arrive. My return was
professionally prepared, is very straightforward and could have been
easily scrutinized. Given this, the amount of delay seems excessive.
Why does it take so long to get a refund?</TE>
<TE>   A: It doesn't--if you file electronically and have your refund
deposited directly into your bank account. Taxpayers this year were
getting refunds within two weeks using those methods.</TE>
<TE>   Because you (or your preparer) insist on filing a paper return,
your tax information has to be manually entered in IRS computers by
agency staff. Given that millions of returns arrived the same day
yours did, it's not surprising that it took the IRS, and your state
agency, a few weeks to complete the transaction.</TE>
<TE>   When you file your return electronically, your information
bypasses the old-fashioned manual-entry process. And when you request
direct deposit, you cut several more days off the process, because
the tax agency doesn't have to print and mail you a check.</TE>
<TE>   If you're in a hurry next year, consider these options to speed
the processing of your return--and maybe save your government a
little money.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pay-on-Death Accounts Can Be Good Solution</TE>
<TE>   Q: Thank you for your column and the many exhortations to get
estate plans in order, as well as the occasional kind slap on the
cheek when people propose risky or useless acts. I have been the
indirect recipient of such slaps, and I thank you! In particular,
kudos for your recent column about "pay-on-death" arrangements for
bank accounts. Until your column, I had not heard of this method to
avoid probate.</TE>
<TE>   A: Glad to be of service. Probate is the court process that
typically follows a death, and it can be expensive and lengthy in
certain states, including California and New York.</TE>
<TE>   That's why people in these states look for ways to avoid it by
using pay-on-death accounts, joint tenancy and living trusts. You can
find a good discussion of these devices in "Plan Your Estate," by
Denis Clifford and Cora Jordan (Nolo Press, 2001).</TE>
<TE>   If your assets are few and your financial system is simple, using
pay-on-death accounts can be a good solution. You simply designate
someone to receive the money in the account. The beneficiary presents
your death certificate to the bank or brokerage, and the assets are
transferred without going through probate.</TE>
<TE>   If your estate is big enough to incur estate taxes, however, you'd
be smart to have your plans reviewed by a qualified estate-planning
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by the mail this column gets, too many people try to save
a few bucks by not hiring an attorney, a strategy that often results
in hassles and unnecessary costs for their heirs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not Everyone Attempts to Avoid Dodging Taxes</TE>
<TE>   Q: You recently responded to someone asking about the arguments
tax protesters use to justify not paying their share. I have another
perspective to add.</TE>
<TE>   I teach adults at night, and once or twice a year I ask the
question, "How do you feel about paying taxes?"</TE>
<TE>   The reply is usually negative. Last year, I had several foreign
students. Their reply was eye-opening. They said, "I like to pay
taxes in America. You get to see the results. Roads are fixed. Police
officers and firefighters come to your house when called. Your
children get books in school, etc. You pay taxes in my country and
watch the potholes get bigger every year."</TE>
<TE>   A: Your students have an excellent point: Our tax system isn't
perfect by any means, but the public services we get in return are
among the best in the world.</TE>

<HD>IRS Revises Rules for Mandatory Distributions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Retirees with substantial tax-sheltered nest eggs--and a desire to
keep that savings sheltered for as long as possible--will find good
news in the Internal Revenue Service's newly revamped rules for
mandatory distributions.</LD>
<LD>   These are the rules that tell individuals the minimum amount they
must withdraw from retirement savings each year.</LD>
<LD>   Many retirees want that number to be as low as possible, so they
can limit their current income taxes and allow their savings to last
longer. The recent IRS rule change does just that.</LD>
<TE>   But the mandatory distribution rules remain highly complicated,
and retirees must to be careful not to run afoul of IRS regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a look at the latest rule change and at the IRS'
clarification of another aspect of distribution requirements:</TE>
<TE>   Question: What are mandatory distribution rules?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: All types of retirement plans for which savers get an
upfront tax deduction--IRAs, 401(k), 403(b) and 457 plans--require
that individuals start taking money out of these accounts when the
account holder hits age 70 1/2. The same applies to tax-deferred
annuities.</TE>
<TE>   The idea behind this requirement is simple: The government has
waited a long time to tax this money, but it won't wait forever.
Mandatory distribution rules, which specify the minimum retirees must
take out of tax-favored plans each year, mean to ensure that
individuals pay tax on their retirement savings before they die.</TE>
<TE>   Retirees can take more from savings than the rules specify; they
just can't take less.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS first revamped its mandatory distribution rules in 2001,
greatly simplifying them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why were the rules changed again?</TE>
<TE>   A: First, last summer's federal tax reform act required the IRS to
use more current life expectancy tables than the decade-old figures
the agency had been using. By updating the life expectancy tables
this year to reflect that people are living longer, the IRS is giving
seniors more time to take money out of retirement plans.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the agency was flooded with questions about its 2001
revision of the rules, and realized that although the regulations
were less complex, they still were confusing enough to require
clarification on some issues.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What do the latest changes mean in practical terms?</TE>
<TE>   A: The lifespan change to the standard distribution table--called
the uniform lifetime table--raises the divisor that retirees use to
figure out how much they need to take from savings each year.</TE>
<TE>   For example, with the previous formula, a 70-year-old with
$500,000 saved would have had to take $19,084 out of his retirement
accounts last year. With the new table, that retiree's required
distribution in 2002 drops to $18,248.</TE>
<TE>   That allows the retiree to save $251 in current-year
taxes--assuming he pays roughly 30% of his income in tax. It also
allows him to leave an extra $836 in tax-deferred savings for another
year.</TE>
<TE>   Because the new formula allows similar reductions in the amounts
that must be withdrawn in future years, experts believe the change
will help ensure that more retirees won't run out of savings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Does everyone use the uniform lifetime table?</TE>
<TE>   A: Most people do. But married couples with large age
disparities--a difference exceeding 10 years--may instead choose to
calculate a different distribution formula that's based on their
joint life expectancies. That would allow them to pull money out of
retirement savings even more slowly.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What else did the IRS change in its latest revamp?</TE>
<TE>   A: There was one significant clarification about how the mandatory
distribution rules affect retirement account beneficiaries after the
original account holder's death.</TE>
<TE>   In the IRS' 2001 simplification of the mandatory distribution
regulations, the agency said that designated beneficiaries could be
determined by Dec. 31 of the year following the death, said Steven
Silverberg, a New York-based tax attorney.</TE>
<TE>   That led some to believe that heirs could change beneficiaries
posthumously. But that wasn't what the IRS intended. The agency was
simply giving heirs the ability to remove "tainted" beneficiaries
from the distribution formula, when several people or entities were
named to get shares of the account, Silverberg said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why is that important?</TE>
<TE>   A: Distribution rules require that all beneficiaries of a
retirement account adhere to the distribution formula applied to the
beneficiary who has the shortest allowed distribution schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Tainted beneficiaries--that is, a beneficiary that is not a person
but an entity such as a charity or trust--have no lifespan over which
to stretch account distributions. So the IRS requires tainted
beneficiaries to withdraw all account assets within five years of the
original owner's death.</TE>
<TE>   The ability to remove a tainted beneficiary allows the remaining
beneficiaries to take account distributions over the oldest
beneficiary's estimated lifespan, which helps those who don't need
the money right away and who don't look forward to paying a big
income tax bill.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: How is a tainted beneficiary removed?</TE>
<TE>   A: An estate would use other assets to buy out that entity's
interest in the retirement account. For instance, if a $100,000 IRA
was left equally to a child and a charity, the child would be able to
take $50,000 of other assets and give it to the charity to have that
charity removed as a beneficiary.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What if the named beneficiary is a living trust?</TE>
<TE>   A: Then the person's heirs are stuck with the five-year formula,
Silverberg said.</TE>
<TE>   That makes it all the more important for anyone with a retirement
account to fill out beneficiary paperwork and make sure they name
beneficiaries and backup beneficiaries.</TE>

<HD>After the Bust, It's Time for Payback</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once an economic and stock market boom goes bust, the search for the
guilty begins.</LD>
<LD>   In the U.S., that search has been underway in earnest for more
than a year. It is now in the retribution phase: Those held
responsible for the boom/bust cycle--or those viewed as having
profited unfairly from it--are getting the bill for the financial and
psychological pain they are accused of visiting on the population at
large.</LD>
<LD>   Retribution was the order du jour in a broad cross-section of
venues last week:</LD>
<TE>   * At Bank of America Corp.'s annual meeting, shareholders
surprised management by approving a measure to seek limits on
severance-pay packages for top executives.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution requests that the company's board allow a
shareholder vote on any severance agreement worth more than twice an
executive's annual salary and bonus. The proposal, put up for a vote
at BofA's annual meeting by union pension funds, stemmed from the
$30-million severance package given to former BofA President David
Coulter when he resigned in 1998 at the age of 51.</TE>
<TE>   In the boom years, a proposal like this was sure to fail on a
major company's proxy ballot. Institutional shareholders almost never
said "no" to management. But post-Enron Corp., the mood has clearly
changed.</TE>
<TE>   "Shareholders Poke Holes in Bank of America's Golden Parachutes,"
the Teamsters union gloated in a news release.</TE>
<TE>   * The New York state attorney general's investigation of Wall
Street analysts' conduct became a full-fledged pile-on, as the North
American Securities Administrators Assn., the National Assn. of
Securities Dealers, and, finally, the Securities and Exchange
Commission joined the fray.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said it opened a "formal inquiry" to look at analysts'
stock recommendations and whether they have been tainted by conflicts
of interest within brokerages--for example, by the need to drum up
fee-rich investment banking business.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC's move was viewed as inevitable in the wake of the
evidence New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer turned up after a 10-month
probe of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s Internet-analyst department.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's now-famous report, released April 8, accused Merrill
analysts of routinely recommending to investors in 2000 and 2001
Internet stocks that they secretly viewed as sure losers.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC, which is supposed to be the nation's principal watchdog
over securities markets, was forced to acknowledge that Spitzer's
revelations--including private Merrill e-mails between
analysts--"reinforced the commission's conclusion that further
inquiry is warranted" into analysts' conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill, which has denied wrongdoing, nonetheless took a stab at
apologizing Friday. At the firm's annual meeting, Chairman David
Komansky said the "e-mails that have come to light are very
distressing and disappointing to us."</TE>
<TE>   Merrill's shareholders seem more than mildly disappointed: The
stock slumped 13% last week to its lowest level since October.
Brokerage shares in general were sharply lower on fears that the
industry as a whole will face severe retribution if outright fraud in
stock touting is shown to have been common among analysts as the
late-1990s bull market roared, then died.</TE>
<TE>   * A key symbol of the U.S. economy's might in the 1990s--the
dollar--came under attack in global currency markets, adding to Wall
Street's already heavy load of worries.</TE>
<TE>   By Friday the dollar had slumped to a 3 1/2-month low against the
euro and to a seven-week low against the Japanese yen.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the dollar's surge over the last decade, last week's
give-back doesn't look like much. It took 90.2 U.S. cents to buy one
euro on Friday, still far less than the $1.17 the European currency
was worth when introduced in January 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, a dollar still buys more yen today than it did a few
years ago. One dollar was worth 128.1 yen as of Friday, compared with
102 yen in late 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The important questions are what is behind the dollar's sudden
weakness and whether the slide is the start of a long-term trend.</TE>
<TE>   If the dollar sell-off reflects concern on the part of foreign
investors that the relative appeal of U.S. assets is dimming, then
the buck's decline may signal a sort of global retribution against
the American economy and its markets.</TE>
<TE>   A currency, after all, often is a good barometer of what's right,
or wrong, with the economy it represents. The dollar's surge in the
late 1990s was in large part a function of the fundamental strengths
of the U.S. economy, especially compared with the alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, America's traditional role as a safe haven became even
more important from 1994 to 1999 as Mexico, Brazil, Russia and most
East Asian countries were forced to devalue their currencies,
depressing their economies.</TE>
<TE>   A strong dollar meant that U.S. consumers paid less for foreign
goods, while foreigners paid more for U.S. goods. A robust currency
also allowed the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep interest rates subdued
and made American assets of all kinds--businesses, stocks, bonds,
etc.--instantly more appealing for foreign investors because of the
currency's appreciation potential.</TE>
<TE>   Consider this example: If a Japanese investor paid the equivalent
of 102 yen for a U.S. asset in late 1999, that asset today would be
worth 128 to the Japanese investor if its value in U.S. dollars
simply stayed the same.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder foreigners have been willing to continue to finance the
U.S. economy, as shown by the record U.S. trade gap. The current
account, the broadest measure of the nation's trade balance, was in
deficit by a massive $417 billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   Economists have long warned about America's dependence on foreign
capital, but in the 1990s global investors increasingly had few good
alternatives to U.S. assets. America won at the expense of others,
particularly those countries that suffered devaluations.</TE>
<TE>   If that favorable perception of U.S. assets changes, and foreign
capital investment here withers, the implications could be serious. A
weaker dollar might be welcomed by U.S. exporters because it would
make their goods cheaper overseas, but it also would make imports
more expensive, potentially fueling inflation and higher interest
rates.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, U.S. interest rates (such as on Treasury securities)
might have to rise to hold on to foreign capital.</TE>
<TE>   These warnings have been recited like a broken record for the last
two decades. Yet the day of reckoning never came. And if the dollar
suddenly strengthens in the next few weeks, the warnings about
foreign-capital dependence will again fall by the wayside.</TE>
<TE>   There is a powerful argument that U.S. assets still are the best
alternative for global investors, given the economic despair in
Japan, the perennial uncertainty about the future of an aging Europe
and the risks inherent in many smaller markets.</TE>
<TE>   But the same doubts and concerns that are dogging American
investors about the true health of the economy and the U.S. financial
system--the anger over executives' rich salaries, the suspicions
about brokerage analysts' objectivity, the lingering excesses of the
technology capital spending boom, and the underlying fear that
corporate accounting has been dishonest--are almost certainly
registering with foreign investors as well.</TE>
<TE>   It may be only a coincidence, but the U.S. stock market, as
measured by the popular indexes that foreign investors watch, is
among the worst-performing of major (and many minor) markets this
year.</TE>
<TE>   The blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index is down 6.3% year to
date, after last week's steep sell-off. The Nasdaq composite index is
down 14.7% year to date.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Germany's main market index is down 3.1% for the
year, the British market is down 1.1%, Canada is off 0.8% and the
Japanese Nikkei-225 index is up 9.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the price of gold is up 11.8% so far this year, to a
two-year high of $311.60 an ounce Friday in New York futures trading.</TE>
<TE>   Numbers like those may just add to foreigners' sense that there
finally may be better places to put money than in U.S. financial
assets.</TE>
<TE>   Of all of the forms of retribution that may await the U.S.
economy, markets and key players of the boom/bust cycle, the threat
of "payback" by foreign investors is among the most frightful.</TE>

<LD>Andersen Bid to Reopen Settlement Talks Fails</LD>
<LD>   A last-ditch effort by accounting firm Arthur Andersen to restart
talks with federal prosecutors on settling its criminal indictment
failed, setting the stage for the trial on an obstruction-of-justice
chargeto start May 6 in Houston.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, a bidding war was developing for various pieces of
Andersen, crippled by the federal charge that it destroyed documents
sought in the investigation of its accounting work for bankrupt Enron
Corp. PricewaterhouseCoopers had entered talks to buy scattered
portions of the firm, according to people familiar with Andersen's
efforts to sell offices and practice groups to rivals. Previously,
PricewaterhouseCoopers had avoided bidding because of its status as
the largest U.S. accounting firm.</LD>
<TE>   And after a conference call with Andersen's senior executives, BDO
Seidman looked to be the front-runner for Andersen's middle market
business practice. Grant Thornton and McGladrey &amp; Pullen also have
talked to Andersen about purchasing the firm's middle market business
practice.</TE>
<TE>   The winner probably will replace Andersen as the nation's
fifth-largest accounting firm.</TE>

<TE>   Gates Takes the Stand in Microsoft Case</TE>
<TE>   The decision to put brilliant but volatile Microsoft Corp.
Chairman Bill Gates on the stand in the Microsoft Corp. antitrust
trial turned out to be not so risky after all.</TE>
<TE>   After three days of testifying in U.S. District Court, experts
said, Gates--the richest man in the world--succeeded in putting a
human face on his company's complex antitrust battle with California
and eight other states.</TE>
<TE>   The antitrust case, which experts say probably will set legal
precedents and affect the technology industry, is scheduled to
conclude sometime next month.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   House OKs Bill for Better Look at Firms' Finances</TE>
<TE>   The Republican-led House, in the strongest congressional response
yet to Enron Corp.'s collapse, passed a bill that would give
investors a fuller and more accurate picture of a company's finances,
especially from outside auditors.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats who control the Senate contended the House bill
doesn't go far enough, setting up an election-year fight that could
hinder chances of far-reaching reforms.</TE>
<TE>   The measure, approved after months of hearings on Enron's descent
into bankruptcy and the role in its fall played by its indicted
auditor, Arthur Andersen, would create a new accounting oversight
board and impose new financial disclosure requirements on publicly
traded companies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Hires Giuliani to Help It Negotiate</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. has hired former New York Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani to help it negotiate with the state attorney general's
office over charges of deception and conflict of interest in
Merrill's stock-research operation.</TE>
<TE>   Observers said tapping Giuliani shows how seriously Merrill takes
the allegations by New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer and the damage
they could do to the No. 1 brokerage.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani, a former U.S. attorney in New York who aggressively
prosecuted insider trading and other securities cases in the 1980s,
opened a private consulting business, Giuliani Partners, after ending
his term as mayor Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani has been offering Merrill advice on how to make
structural changes to enhance its research unit's independence from
its investment-banking operation. He also has been authorized to
assist in negotiations on a broad settlement with Spitzer's office.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, meanwhile, has expanded his investigation of analyst
conduct to include other top Wall Street firms, including Morgan
Stanley, CS First Boston and Goldman Sachs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BofA Shareholders Seek Curb on Severance Pay</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders of Bank of America Corp. approved a resolution asking
the company's board to limit severance pay for executives.</TE>
<TE>   The measure, sponsored by the Teamsters pension plan and opposed
by BofA's management, passed at the banking giant's annual meeting by
a 51% vote--unprecedented for such proposals at large companies,
where shareholders typically accede to management's wishes.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution asks the bank's directors to require a shareholder
vote on any severance agreements worth more than twice an executive's
annual salary and bonus.</TE>
<TE>   The measure is only a request, which the company's board could
reject or modify.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, shareholder activists said the victory marks an
important milestone in their campaign to send a strong message to
corporate America about perceived abuses in corporate governance.</TE>

<TE>   Micron to Buy Much of Hynix for $3.6 Billion</TE>
<TE>   After a long and uncertain courtship, Micron Technology Inc.
agreed to acquire the bulk of South Korea's Hynix Semiconductor Inc.
to create the world's largest maker of memory chips in a deal valued
at $3.6 billion in cash and stock.</TE>
<TE>   The merger, which requires approval from antitrust regulators and
the creditors of financially ailing Hynix, would create a juggernaut
that would control one-third of the $11-billion global market for
computer memory.</TE>
<TE>   It also would further consolidate a troubled industry
characterized in recent years by plunging prices and tepid demand
from personal computer manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   If the Micron deal goes through, the other remaining major memory
makers would be Samsung Electronics Co. and Infineon Technologies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ovitz in Talks to Sell or Merge Talent Firm</TE>
<TE>   Michael Ovitz is negotiating to sell or merge his Hollywood talent
management company with one of a number of entertainment companies,
including the Firm, which specializes in talent management in the
music industry, according to sources close to the talks.</TE>
<TE>   Disappointed that his original vision for a broad-based
entertainment venture never materialized, Ovitz, former president of
Walt Disney Co. and a founding partner of Creative Artists Agency,
has been trying for several months to sell his stake in Artists
Management Group or merge it with another entertainment company.</TE>
<TE>   Though the current negotiations are considered serious, there
remains a strong possibility that Ovitz will not close a deal any
time soon, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Partners at the Firm could not be reached for comment. AMG
declined to comment.</TE>

<TE>   7 Blacks Accuse Del Taco of Racial Discrimination</TE>
<TE>   One current and six former African American employees of Del Taco
Inc. are accusing the nation's second-largest Mexican food chain of
turning a blind eye to repeated race-based harassment from some
Latino workers.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, filed in Los Angeles, alleges that the Laguna
Hills-based company tolerated Latino employees' verbally abusing some
blacks, passing them over for promotions in favor of Latinos and
firing blacks and replacing them with undocumented Latino workers.</TE>
<TE>   Those who complained about their poor treatment lost their jobs,
according to the suit, which seeks unspecified damages including lost
wages, punitive damages and reinstatement.</TE>
<TE>   Closely held Del Taco, which has 395 restaurants in 10 states,
said it had received the lawsuit document but declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Repetitive-Motion Injury Rate Up in Some States</TE>
<TE>   A decade-long decline in the rate of repetitive-motion injuries in
the workplace slowed to a near-standstill in 2000 and the rate even
climbed in some states, including California, according to an
analysis of federal data by the AFL-CIO.</TE>
<TE>   The national labor federation's annual report on workplace
injuries also noted that although job fatalities declined overall,
they increased among Latino workers. The on-the-job fatality rate in
2000 for Latinos was 5.6 per 100,000, the highest in at least five
years.</TE>
<TE>   The report was highly critical of the Bush administration's record
on worker protection, particularly its repeal of a short-lived
ergonomic standard that recently was replaced with voluntary
compliance guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   An administration spokeswoman noted that the trends cited in the
AFL-CIO report predate President Bush's inauguration.</TE>

<HD>Food Firms Hope You Can Never Have Too Much of a Sweeter
Thing</HD>
<DH>Nutrition: More sugar is being added to products, alarming
consumer groups that seek federal consumption guidelines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget dinner. These days most food companies are moving right on to
dessert, pumping up the sugar in many of their new products--even
diet food--in hopes of attracting new customers and boosting sales of
tired brands.</LD>
<LD>   Even frozen french fries are getting a chocolate and cinnamon
sugar makeover.</LD>
<LD>   Sweet sells, judging by the top-selling products of last year.</LD>
<TE>   And they still can be marketed as "healthy," because consumers
coming off the low-fat kick of the 1990s have been trained to look
only at fat and calories and care little about the rising sugar
levels in food.</TE>
<TE>   However, a growing number of doctors and nutritionists warn that
the increasing use of sugar is becoming a major factor in obesity
and, therefore, adult-onset diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   A key national nutrition advisory panel is considering whether to
recommend a new limit on sugar, although some experts said such a
curb won't discourage consumers from eating more sweetened foods.</TE>
<TE>   The average consumer eats 152 pounds of sugar a year, 30 pounds
more than two decades ago, according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   Sugar use in food has been increasing since the mid-1990s, the
USDA said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very indulgent time we live in right now," said Tom
Vierhile, executive editor of Productscan Online, a food product
information service of Marketing Intelligence Service Ltd. "It's kind
of strange to see this trend, when all evidence would suggest that
the last thing we need is more indulgent food."</TE>
<TE>   Although growing consumption of soft drinks containing
high-fructose corn sweeteners accounts for a large part of the
increase in sugar intake, doctors say the emphasis on low-fat food
also played a part.</TE>
<TE>   Food companies "took out the fat, but replaced it with sugar,"
said Sam Andrews, a New Orleans endocrinologist and coauthor of the
diet book "Sugar Busters!" The downing of so much low-fat food during
the 1990s, he said, "has just encouraged us to eat more sugar."</TE>
<TE>   Because many sugary products such as yogurt still are relatively
low in calories and, in some cases, are fortified with vitamins and
minerals, most people consider them healthy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Despite Low-Fat Foods, Most Gained Pounds</TE>
<TE>   But the proof is in the waistband, nutritionists say. Most people
actually gained weight during the low-fat craze of the 1990s. Sixty
percent of the U.S. population is overweight or obese.</TE>
<TE>   Yet neither food companies nor federal health officials have
addressed the spiraling consumption of sweeteners and the role they
are playing in fattening America.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups such as the Center for Science in the Public
Interest have lobbied the government to require food companies to
clearly label the amount of added sugars, such as corn syrup,
dextrose and maltose, in all packaged goods and include a maximum
recommended allowance so consumers can see how much sugar they are
eating.</TE>
<TE>   However, nearly three years after receiving a petition from the
Center for Science in the Public Interest, the Food and Drug
Administration still is considering the request.</TE>
<TE>   Many, including Michael Jacobson, executive director of the
consumer group, blame intense lobbying by the sugar and sweetener
industries for the government's refusal to take as tough a stance on
sugar as it has on fat.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Sugar Assn., the trade group for the sugar industry,
acknowledged that it asked the USDA several years ago to change the
proposed wording of its dietary guidelines on sugar. The wording now
urges consumers to use "moderation" rather than "limit" their sugar
intake.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no evidence that sugar in moderation has any ill
effects," said Sugar Assn. President Richard Keelor. "It's our job to
make sure they look at the preponderance of science, and that's the
law."</TE>
<TE>   To help make its case, the industry has on occasion sponsored
health research, Keelor said.</TE>
<TE>   And it is a fierce opponent of anyone who criticizes sugar.
Critics have in some cases been threatened with legal action for
making what the organization says are "misleading" statements.</TE>
<TE>   New York University nutritionist Marion Nestle, author of "Food
Politics," was sent a letter by the Sugar Assn. after making some
remarks critical of sugar during her recent book tour.</TE>
<TE>   "[The USDA] is up against a very powerful industry that chooses
the kinds of studies that [the agency] looks at and gives its own
interpretation of sugar on health," Nestle said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, she said, it's important that people, especially
kids, limit sugar intake. And that, she said, is getting harder as
people get used to sweeter and sweeter foods.</TE>
<TE>   In the May issue of Consumer Reports magazine, she noted, the
highest-rated peanut butters were picked as much for their sweet
taste as for their peanut flavor. Unsweetened peanut butter was
described as "bitter."</TE>
<TE>   "That's not the word I would use. "I would describe it as
peanutty," she said. "As people get used to sweet tastes, [products]
have to be sweeter and sweeter."</TE>
<TE>   Nestle said sugar encourages people to eat bigger portions,
creating bigger demand.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An Inexpensive Way to Revamp Products</TE>
<TE>   Because sugar is such a cheap ingredient, it's also an easy way
for food companies to court new customers and update existing
products.</TE>
<TE>   Birds Eye recently rolled out Sqeezle Sauz--applesauce in a tube
with sweet strawberry flavor. Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies
recently got a layer of rich cream in the middle to become Chips Ahoy
Cremewich.</TE>
<TE>   And more decadent desserts and bakery items are being marketed in
snack sizes so consumers can pop them on the go.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just dessert that's getting sweeter. Even foods most
consumers think of as healthy or dietetic are coming out in sweeter
versions.</TE>
<TE>   Four ounces of General Mills Inc.'s Yoplait Whips, a new yogurt
mousse, contains 21 grams of sugar, 50% more than in the company's
6-ounce Dannon Light yogurt.</TE>
<TE>   Food experts said sweet is selling better these days partly
because consumers are feeling more time-strapped and stressed and
want a sugary treat as a reward.</TE>
<TE>   The more indulgent the product, the more appealing it sounds,
especially to women, said Amy Lazenby, a brand manager at Nestle
USA's Power Bar division.</TE>
<TE>   Power Bar, an energy bar designed for athletes, late last year
rolled out Pria, a vitamin-enhanced, chocolate-coated soy cookie in
flavors such as Creme Caramel Crisp and Strawberry Shortcake.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, sugary snacks like these are replacing meals as
more people grab food on the go, eating yogurt in a tube in the car
or pulling into a gas station between appointments to grab an energy
bar.</TE>
<TE>   And because parents are pressed for time, kids are getting more
convenience foods that often are more sugary than meals prepared at
home, experts said. One example is milk and cereal breakfast bars,
one of General Mills' best-selling new product lines last year.</TE>
<TE>   Snack or meal-replacement bars like these have been edging their
way into American diets faster than any other food. Sales have risen
12% in the last year, according to data from Information Resources
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Of the more than 1,400 snack products introduced to the market
last year, snack bars were among the top sellers. And energy bars
aside, the bulk of the top sellers as tracked by Information
Resources were sweet products.</TE>
<TE>   Food marketers say that's what consumers are demanding.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't had to pull any products because they're too sweet,"
said John Carroll, managing director of potatoes and snacks for Heinz
North America.</TE>
<TE>   Heinz is rolling out chocolate and cinnamon-sugar frozen French
fries, part of it's Funky Fries line, in May.</TE>
<TE>   Like many of the items launched in grocery stores last year, these
products are geared to kids and teenagers, who now represent about a
quarter of the population and snack an average of two or more times a
day.</TE>
<TE>   One of the best-selling products for this group was ConAgra Foods
Inc.'s new Jolly Rancher refrigerated gelatin cups--regular gelatin
packed with more intense sweet and sour flavors.</TE>
<TE>   The product's success is prompting ConAgra to roll out other
portable dessert products, such as Hershey chocolate pudding packaged
in a tube and chocolate-covered caramel popcorn that it is testing in
some markets.</TE>
<TE>   "We just can't make enough of [the popcorn]," said Tim McMahon,
senior vice president of marketing for ConAgra Foods. "It's that
popular."</TE>
<TE>   Other types of staple foods--from meat to nuts--are getting sweet
glazes. Honey has become a favorite flavor of food companies, McMahon
said, because people think of it as "natural," so therefore better
for you.</TE>
<TE>   And natural products such as nuts are getting new, sweeter flavors
such as apple cinnamon and pecan pie.</TE>
<TE>   Is this extra dose of sugar such a bad thing, especially if more
people eat nuts and vitamin-laced snack bars instead of less
nutritious snacks such as Twinkies?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not, some say. But many nutritionists and doctors seem to
agree that most Americans need to reduce their sugar intake.</TE>
<TE>   They just don't agree on why and how much of these sweeteners is
too much.</TE>
<TE>   Some say sugar is a carbohydrate like any other, and if eaten in
excess it can cause obesity and tooth decay. But others believe that,
because sweeteners more readily convert to blood sugar than other
types of carbohydrates, they carry other health risks as well.</TE>
<TE>   Some, like Dr. Ronald Krauss, head of UC Berkeley's department of
nutritional sciences and a member of the National Academy of Sciences
food and nutrition board, believe there is ample evidence that
consumption of a certain amount of sugar is linked to increased blood
triglyceride levels, which can put people at increased risk for heart
disease and Type 2 diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   "Excess sugar consumption in people with a history of heart
disease should be discouraged," Krauss said.</TE>
<TE>   No one, including Krauss, is willing to call sugar addictive. But,
he said, "I think there is a sugar attraction, a clear link between
sugar and the desire to get more."</TE>
<TE>   Sugar, in all its forms, nutritionists said, has been an effective
tool for cereal makers to attract children and to get them eating
more of their products.</TE>
<TE>   But soft drink consumption is of the greatest concern, and is fast
becoming a major factor in obesity in children, said Dr. Benjamin
Caballero of Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health.</TE>
<TE>   Caballero said the biggest risk he sees from sugar is that it is
edging out other nutrients in our diets, noting that soft drinks have
reduced consumption of calcium-rich milk.</TE>
<TE>   More of the ever-increasing calories in food are coming from
additional sugar.</TE>
<TE>   Krauss believes that more research needs to be done on sugar's
effects on health.</TE>
<TE>   "The science is not where I want it to be," Krauss said. "It's so
hard to get ... proof that any dietary practice is the magic bullet
in disease."</TE>
<TE>   Krauss said the National Academy of Sciences food and nutrition
board will release a report this summer that could recommend an upper
limit on sugar. He declined to discuss the contents of the report
further.</TE>
<TE>   But many say it's unlikely that regulators will urge consumers to
rein in their sugar habits on this advice.</TE>
<TE>   And with sweet indulgence selling so well, food companies aren't
expected to reduce the sugar in their products or offer low-sugar
versions, as they did low-fat versions in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Few Firms Acknowledge Increasing Sugar Levels</TE>
<TE>   Most food companies refuse to acknowledge that their product lines
are getting sweeter.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Kraft Foods Inc. say sweet "is not a strategy." Kraft
spokeswoman Claire Regan said it's only coincidence that many of its
new products are sugary.</TE>
<TE>   General Mills declined to discuss the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Yet new product reformulations and sweeter versions of existing
products are being launched all the time to boost sales.</TE>
<TE>   The first visible example of this happened at the end of the
low-fat craze.</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to boost waning sales of its low-fat Snackwell's
cookies in 1998, Nabisco increased the sugar content, said Vierhile
of Productscan.</TE>
<TE>   Although most Americans seem to have caught on that gulping
low-fat cookies won't keep them from putting on weight, nutrition--if
encased in a sweet package--is still a big sell. Case in point: Body
Smarts, a new line of candy and snack bars that contain large amounts
of sugar as well as 30% of the recommended daily allowance for
calcium and all of the allowance for vitamin C.</TE>
<TE>   Although a small but growing number of low-carbohydrate dieters
are watching sugar, few other Americans seem to care, nutritionists
say.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, a recent study conducted by market research firm NPD
Group Inc. said most people don't care if they gain weight, despite
the health implications.</TE>
<TE>   But at least one anti-sugar activist is fighting fire with fire.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Appleton, author of "Lick the Sugar Habit," plans to help
peddle a new gum called Sugar Fighter via an infomercial. She claims
the gum will make sugar taste like cardboard for 45 minutes after it
has been chewed.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you how many sugar-holics there are out there that
need help," Appleton said.</TE>

<LD>Ten years have passed since Los Angeles erupted in reaction to the
verdicts in the Rodney King police brutality trial. Almost anyone old
enough to remember those five chaotic days in the spring of 1992 has
a tale to tell--of anger, of fear, of awakening, of transformation.
Here, 32 people interviewed by Times staffers talk about what they'll
never forget.</LD>
<LD>   'It was just very scary'</LD>
<LD>   Rian Williams, 24, is the education services coordinator at A
Place Called Home, a South-Central community center that mentors
youth through the arts. She grew up in South-Central and was a
ninth-grader at John Adams Middle School at the time of the riots.</LD>
<TE>   When the verdict was released, we were across the street from
school, in front of the YMCA. There was a group of us outside
playing, and one of the girls' mother came by and said, "You all need
to go in the house and watch TV." When I got home, the TV was on, and
I saw the fires and stuff. It was really scary. It hadn't gotten to
our immediate community yet.</TE>
<TE>   Time passed, and we stood on the porch and you could see the thick
smoke and the orange and the grayish colors from all the fires. It
happened so quickly. It was like a chain reaction.</TE>
<TE>   The scariest thing I remember is walking and seeing the [trucks]
coasting down Central Avenue--a lot of them. They had the National
Guard with the helmets, the fatigues, the guns and everything. It was
the scariest thing to see them marching around stone-faced.</TE>
<TE>   On San Pedro and Adams, there was a shopping center, and there
were people breaking into stores and setting fires. It was just very
scary. I remember going with my friends and one of my uncles to one
of the shopping centers, and [someone] said, "Get down, I'm going to
shoot the lock off." They went in the store--it was a flower
shop--and took baskets and things. We just stared. We were just
tagging along, but I was thinking "My grandma's gonna kill me."</TE>
<TE>   People were taking clothes, radios, everything. But I knew it
wasn't going to change the verdicts to grab a TV. It wouldn't justify
anything for me. I just remember being very numb and watching
everything. There was so much chaos. It's hard not to think about it
because I still work here and live here. You still see a lot of the
remains, places that have not been rebuilt, empty lots with rubbish
piled up. It's a joke. You hear officials talking about community
development. Hello! We could use a bookstore, a library, a few
schools, a day-care center, a medical facility.</TE>
<TE>   It changed the way that I saw people. Being 14, you're really
naive still. To see what anger and frustration and oppression can
bring about, that gave me a greater awareness of where I wanted to be
in my life. I wanted to make circumstances in my life that were
positive, where I wouldn't feel that type of frustration. Back then,
I understood why people did the things they did. But now, I don't
feel an oppressed, frustrated people should be justified in behaving
that way.</TE>
<TE>   'And then the bricks flying'</TE>
<TE>   Tony Wafford, 45, is the community advisory board chair for the
HIV Prevention Trials Network in Los Angeles. In 1992, he was a
publicist and lived in Whittier.</TE>
<TE>   I went over to the barbershop around noon. It's at Florence and
Hobart. It was business as usual. People talking. Socializing. There
was talk about the verdict. I didn't really feel too much. I knew,
"That's the way it goes." The older people came in there who really
believed in truth and justice and the American way and suffered
through Jim Crow. The reality hit them.</TE>
<TE>   Then all of a sudden, we were watching all hell breaking loose. We
literally saw it. We saw the police cars going east on Florence and
then the bricks flying. Then the police cars headed back west. My
friend Lawrence and myself went down there, and I'll never forget
there was a Hispanic couple in a Volvo and the crowd thought they
were white. People started throwing bricks and attacking them. I told
Lawrence, who is light-skinned, that he better get a Kufi [African
hat] so people will know he's black. We go back to the barbershop and
see the Denny thing on TV. So we go back, and there's Reginald on his
side. Bleeding like a dog.</TE>
<TE>   'Everything just escalates'</TE>
<TE>   Margie Hernandez, 45, a consultant for nonprofit organizations,
lives in Whittier. She was at work at Warner Bros. in Burbank when
the verdicts were announced and protests soon began. She and her
co-workers were told to go home.</TE>
<TE>   Back then I had a particular interest in the Rodney King trial
because a co-worker and her husband, a retired LAPD sergeant, were
close friends with Larry Powell, one of the officers on trial. When
the verdict was announced my co-worker friend was happy because the
police officers were acquitted. She was ecstatic!</TE>
<TE>   I just remember thinking, 'Oh, my God, what's going to happen?' I
thought back to the Watts riots of '65 when I was 8 years old, living
in Azusa and seeing that on television and praying for that to never
happen again.</TE>
<TE>   When we were told to leave work and go straight home, well, at
that moment I thought: "This is going to be worse than 1965,"
especially with instantaneous news. Everybody knew what was
happening; and in a way, that's good because you are aware of what's
going on. But, in a way, that also fuels events and everything just
escalates so much quicker.</TE>
<TE>   It took me four hours to get home in what otherwise would have
been a 40-minute drive. And that really made the fear real and made
me believe there is a clear and present danger in this city. And you
don't know what you are going home to.</TE>
<TE>   The riots really forced me to understand we are one people of many
communities and we all need to be treated with respect no matter what
the circumstances. I think if we do that in all areas--business,
politics, relationships--then we will have peace in our communities,
our families, our workplace. We learned that everyone has a voice and
everyone's voice needs to be heard. When you try to stifle a voice,
you may not hear it, but later on it will be a shout. And that's
exactly what happened on April 29, 1992--a shout.</TE>
<TE>   'She didn't care about our lives'</TE>
<TE>   Cliseria Pineda's hands look dry and worn from more than two
decades of work as a single-needle-machine operator in the downtown
garment district. The day the riots began, she was working at a
factory on 12th and San Julian, where the Mexican immigrant, now 42,
sewed for a contractor making clothes for Forever 21.</TE>
<TE>   All the other factories were shut down because people were burning
them. But my factory boss wouldn't shut down. I could smell smoke. I
could hear sirens and firetrucks. I was really afraid. I saw people
running around and grabbing stuff out of buildings. I called my
family and told them not to go out. We tried to talk to the owner and
tell her to shut down, but she refused. I worked a full day.</TE>
<TE>   I realized that, to this owner, I was nothing. She didn't care
about our lives, she just cared about the work.</TE>
<TE>   'I don't feel I could judge anyone'</TE>
<TE>   Carol Sauvion, now 54, was living in Hollywood when the Rodney
King verdict was delivered, less than three months after her husband
unexpectedly died. The widow was left to manage a growing
arts-and-crafts store, Freehand, on West 3rd Street near the Beverly
Center, and her 7-year-old son, Noah.</TE>
<TE>   My son was in that phase of Inspector Gadget at the time. He had
asked for a trench coat for his birthday. He was wearing his trench
coat. When he found out about the riots, we went home and he put on
an army helmet, and he had this Daisy BB gun. He took the gun, and he
went and stood on our front porch. He knew there was a riot.</TE>
<TE>   Later, we were made aware that some children were having trauma
about it. He had already had a trauma because his father passed away
of a heart attack in front of his eyes. He was still dealing with
that. I remember saying to him later on that children were having
nightmares about it. I asked, 'Noah, are you all right about it? Was
it hard for you? Are you afraid? [He said,] 'No, Mom. I was working
the whole time.' He had a sense that he was protecting us somehow. He
felt more in control and less fearful because of that.</TE>
<TE>   I don't feel that I could judge anyone for what they did that day.
I think that I felt the anger that other people felt and the
injustice that other people felt that day.</TE>
<TE>   'We formed a human chain'</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Miles, 51, is a contractor who owns Interfaith 3, a firm
that remodels houses in South Los Angeles. For years he has worked as
a security guard at First AME Church in South-Central L.A., where the
Rev. Cecil "Chip" Murray is pastor.</TE>
<TE>   I was 15 years old in the Los Angeles riots of '65. The night the
'92 riot started, I knew something was terribly wrong. I went to the
church to be around Pastor Chip Murray, learn from him. I knew he'd
say things, and people would listen.</TE>
<TE>   There were already dozens of people in the church; it was still
daylight. Two blocks from there, on Adams Boulevard, a crowd was
about to destroy a liquor store. We went down and saw a line of riot
police. They were nervous. We wanted to keep the police from killing
people. My mission was to protect Chip Murray. My job was to get him
in and out of there safely.</TE>
<TE>   We formed a human chain in front of the police. We didn't want
them to start shooting. Standing in front of people trying to prevent
a riot is insanity. From a distance, someone threw a brick and hit me
in the head. It took the skin off most of my forehead. I remember
saying, "I can't see." They dragged me back to the church and
bandaged me up. Someone said they saw the guy who threw the brick. He
was aiming at the police.</TE>
<TE>   By the time I got back outside, they were setting fires. The
liquor store, an apartment building, a furniture store about 500
yards from the church. The Fire Department wasn't there yet. I
remember a lot of smoke, a lot of sirens, the smell of things
burning. The moon didn't shine. It was eerie.</TE>
<TE>   I tried to talk to four or five guys. They were so enraged. I told
them, "We don't want to relive '65. We can't tear down our own
community." I remember what it was like in '65. We couldn't get food
or basic services.</TE>
<TE>   But it was too late to stop them, stop what everybody was going to
have to experience and the conditions that would follow. I felt
tremendously disappointed and filled with anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, my feelings shifted from disappointment to wanting to
help the people who had survived.</TE>
<TE>   When I see that kind of rage, on news reports, I can feel the
danger again. I watch news about the Middle East, and I know what
that feels like.</TE>
<TE>   'It was just a madness'</TE>
<TE>   Navraj Singh, 53, owner of India's Oven restaurants in Los Angeles
and West L.A., had a restaurant on Pico Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue
that was burned down during the riots. He was returning from a visit
to India and was on a plane from London to Los Angeles when the
captain told the passengers the city was under siege.</TE>
<TE>   Little did I know that when the captain told us what was
happening, my restaurant was burning. It was shocking to know there
were riots in Los Angeles. I didn't think the area we were in was
ripe for destruction. When we landed, we were told that there was a
curfew in the city, and we could not go home.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning I went to the site, and there was nothing left. I
felt terrible. I was devastated. But it was not the end of the world,
you know. I had a very talented, dedicated staff, and I had told them
we would pick up the threads from here. I bought another business and
moved there a month later.</TE>
<TE>   I was not angry at the people who did this, because I knew that
their anger was not directed at me. It was just a madness that was
going on in the city, and we became part of the madness. I'm a very
peaceful man, and I thought, whatever God has done, it's going to be
better for me, and by the grace of God, I'm doing fantastically.</TE>
<TE>   We live in the best country in the world. You can be whatever you
want to be. Those people who are unsatisfied have to go out and see
what is outside this country and realize what we have here. It's like
heaven on earth.</TE>
<TE>   'This is about feeling desperate'</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Angela Oh, 47, was socially active 10 years ago
but catapulted to prominence after the riots. She still practices law
and lectures on race relations to corporations, nonprofits and
students. On the day after the verdicts came down, she drove to the
office of John Lim, then-president of the Korean-American Bar Assn.</TE>
<TE>   On 8th Street, I saw all of these people, and they weren't African
Americans. They were mostly Latinos. Young people. Old people. Men.
Women. Pregnant women. Running out of the local grocery store with
stuff, and this wasn't electronics and televisions. It was sort of
poignant. Because the stuff that people had in their arms were things
like dishwashing soap and diapers and cereal and dish racks. I mean,
these were the working poor. These were not people looking to get
high-end merchandise into their homes. I remember seeing a pregnant
woman, with a child in tow, carrying cereal. And then I saw young men
picking up bricks and just heaving them at glass-paned windows, and
I'm thinking to myself, this is really not about the justice system.
This is about people feeling desperate in general.</TE>
<TE>   The fact of this verdict is really just the last piece that people
could take. It was different from '65, where the racial injustice was
so apparent. Here, it was the economic injustice and desperation. I
mean, you didn't see just black against white. It was a multiracial,
multicultural, intergenerational mess that occurred. The system broke
down.</TE>
<TE>   One thing that we do understand now in 2002 is that when the
demographics begin to shift in such a dramatic way, it has other
implications for institutions, for policy, for how people are going
to conduct themselves in a community.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the tensions may rise, but opportunities to learn also rise.
What is the missing factor? Trust. And so who is responsible for
developing that kind of trust in the community? All of us.</TE>
<TE>   'Somebody hit me in the face'</TE>
<TE>   Julia Sandidge, 43, was a TV news reporter in Minneapolis when the
riots broke out. While covering the story there, she was struck in
the face and kicked in the head. It was two months before she could
walk, a year before she could return to work. Sandidge, who is
married to Times reporter Duane Noriyuki and lives in Crestline,
Calif., is pursuing a teaching career.</TE>
<TE>   We had just seen the riot coverage in Los Angeles [and] were told
something similar could happen in Minneapolis because of this angry
tension between cops and the black communities.</TE>
<TE>   My initial reaction was that the lead of the story would be that
the cops were sitting in their cars and not doing anything to stop
the violence. But the next thing I knew, a group of kids had swarmed
my colleague [photographer Rod Wermager] and started kicking him.</TE>
<TE>   I just ran in screaming, "Stop it." I'm not sure what I thought I
was going to do, but I ran into the middle of the fighting. Somebody
hit me in the face. I thought I had gotten hit with a brick.</TE>
<TE>   I never was able to report objectively after that. I could never
separate myself from the victims that I covered. Ultimately, I think
it was the reason I had to leave TV news.</TE>
<TE>   I don't think I've ever fully recovered from that head injury, and
that affects different parts of my life. I'm not as ambitious as I
was. I'll never have the confidence I had before that. I can never
separate myself from the suffering I see in other people the way I
could before that day. And I think that's a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   'A white girl! Get them!'</TE>
<TE>   Lydia Ramos, 32, is a first-year English and journalism teacher at
Banning High School in Los Angeles. The Long Beach resident worked as
an NBC news producer in New York and L.A. before returning to her
former high school to teach. In 1992 she had just graduated from USC
and was a reporter for the Wave, a community newspaper in
South-Central.</TE>
<TE>   April 29, 1992--that's a day I'll never forget. My assignment was
to cover the happenings outside the First AME Church. But I wanted to
have a camera with me, so I went home to Long Beach to pick it up. My
mother was home. She knew I was going back into the fray. She gave me
a hug like it was the last time she was ever going to see me.</TE>
<TE>   By the time I arrived at the church, there were hundreds of people
outside, upset because they could not get in. They started shouting,
"No justice! No peace! No justice! No peace!" They marched in the
streets. I went along. And then the people started shouting, "Let's
take this to Beverly Hills! Let's take this to Westwood! That's where
we need to be!"</TE>
<TE>   Then something clicked. These guys in a truck jumped onto parked
cars and started bashing in cars. Others tried to loot a liquor store
and a furniture store. At that moment it was either fight or flight.
The outside rally became a riot. I'm seeing people run past me. I
talk to them. They tell me, "This is not why I came. I'm not a part
of this."</TE>
<TE>   I ran back to the church. I knew it was dangerous out there, and I
didn't want to walk to my car alone. I saw a black couple going in
the direction I was headed and asked, "Do you mind if I walk part
ways with you to my car?" "No problem," the guy said.</TE>
<TE>   A tall man stops us and asks, "Is she with you? Watch out for her,
protect her because when you round this corner they're going to get
her."</TE>
<TE>   We joined arms and introduced ourselves. "I'm Lydia Ramos. Hi, my
name is Janice. My name is Greg." As we rounded the corner people
started yelling, "White girl! White girl! Get them! They've got a
white girl! Get them!"</TE>
<TE>   Looters started chasing us. And we're running, running, running.
Then from an alley these two boys, about 14 years old, stop us. One
asks, "Are you coming from the church?" We're about to say yes, but
before we can even say that, he pulls a gun from the back of his
trousers and points it straight to the front of my head. He says, "If
you are not coming from the church, you are going to get filled with
lead."</TE>
<TE>   At that point I could not defend myself. My skin was not black.
That night in that neighborhood I was the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   Greg said, "We're coming from the church, man. We're down. We're
down. Please don't shoot us! Please! Just please let us get back to
our car. We mean no harm. We went to the church service, and now
we're just trying to get back to our car. Please, just calm down."</TE>
<TE>   The kid kept saying I shouldn't be there. He let us go, and we're
running, running, running away from a teenager with a gun pointed to
our backs. We got to Greg's and Janice's car, and I crouched in the
front passenger's seat until we made it to my car. I made it home,
and my mother hugged me like I had never been hugged before.</TE>
<TE>   I was so angry after that experience. I was ashamed about what we
had done to Rodney King, what we had done to the justice system and
what we had done to ourselves. This is my city. This is where I was
born, where my mother was born, where I was raised. I own this city
as much as anybody else. I remember how betrayed I felt. I was
threatened with my life because of the color of my skin.</TE>
<TE>   The riots certainly changed my life and also the focus of my
career. Sometimes you don't know your calling until it comes calling
on you. I came back to the very classroom where I once sat as a
student. I pursued my dream job--to give back to the community--and
here I am, one little part of the solution.</TE>
<TE>   Every day I might be the only adult who is the positive role model
in the lives of 125 kids, the only one who says, "Hello, how are you
doing?"</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to explain what you learn from having a gun put to your
head. But I'm not going to teach my kids the kind of hate I
experienced that night. That's not the way to live in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   'I jumped into the bushes!'</TE>
<TE>   Jervey Tervalon, 43, is the author of the novels "Dead Above
Ground" and "Understand This." He teaches at UCLA's Center for
African American Studies and at Cal State L.A. and is the Remsen Bird
writer-in-residence at Occidental College. He was born in New Orleans
and lives in Altadena.</TE>
<TE>   I decided I was going to go out and walk my dog even though my
wife had told me, "Jervey! People are rioting in the streets! Things
are getting out of hand. Don't walk that dog!" I decided that
nothing's going to happen. We're in Pasadena. So I took my stick, my
cayenne pepper spray and told her, "Not to worry, my dear. I'll be
back shortly."</TE>
<TE>   Then I walk down from our working-class neighborhood toward the
more affluent area near the Rose Bowl. All of a sudden I hear a
gunshot. Then a series of gunshots. Then I get nervous because the
gunshots continue to echo. It's automatic gunfire. And I see trucks
and lowriders driving up to the neighborhood where I'm walking. I
grabbed the dog--about 70 pounds--and jumped into the bushes!
Waiting. They never come. When I work up enough nerve, I started
walking toward the house. I saw a woman outside, working on her car,
and I said in my best inner-city patois, "Fools shootin' up the Rose
Bowl." She said, 'I told them fools not to do that. I told them, say
your prayers and mind your business.'"</TE>
<TE>   'I was in the middle of a shootout'</TE>
<TE>   Ron Salisbury, 69, owns El Cholo, a Mexican restaurant on Western
Avenue. He was at a Dodger game when rioting broke out, and he
decided to check the restaurant, opened in 1927 by his grandparents.</TE>
<TE>   When I got to the restaurant, the rioters weren't in our area, but
it made sense to get everybody out and safely home. We were closed
for seven days after that. I spent my waking hours watching the
restaurant or driving around to see what was going on. A mini-mall
down the street was looted and burned down. I watched people
attacking stores, jumping through windows, loading up their arms,
laughing like it was a big party. Their cars were triple-parked on
the street.</TE>
<TE>   I stopped by a Korean merchant's store to ask the security guard
if he could guard my restaurant. He was carrying a rifle. All of a
sudden he said, "Drop!" A bunch of looters were running toward us. I
was in the middle of a shootout.</TE>
<TE>   For some reason the looters hopped over my restaurant. It was like
a fire that jumps over one spot and starts up somewhere else. Western
between Pico and Olympic was saved.</TE>
<TE>   Every day we took meals to the firefighters. I felt so close to
those guys and the police. They really helped. Then I started to see
how the police were demoralized. I wanted to send a message that I
appreciated them.</TE>
<TE>   When the restaurant finally opened, we held a contest. Buy a
raffle ticket, if you win you can own El Cholo for a day. The police
chief had suggested getting computers for their offices. But I was
driving home one night and saw a squad car pass by. I thought, now
that's sexy. We used the money from the raffle to buy a squad car.</TE>
<TE>   I understand myself better because of the riots. You never know
how you'll react to something like that. I want to experience as much
of life as possible.</TE>
<TE>   'My brother's business burned'</TE>
<TE>   Jong Min Kang, 43, is a business owner and president of the Korean
American Business Assn. He led a volunteer security patrol known as
the Korean Young Adult Team of Los Angeles. Armed and wearing white
headbands, they tried to protect Korean-owned businesses. By the
third day of rioting, the group had 450 members.</TE>
<TE>   Dark sky, dark sky, dark sky from the fires. A lot of people were
crying. So many people stole from stores, no police. Many people who
came to America with very little money and worked hard to start
businesses lost everything in one night. My brother's business
burned. He went back to Korea. I lost my brother, I lost friends.</TE>
<TE>   Many children watched their parents' businesses burn. If you lost
your business or if someone made a fire at your parents' store, a lot
of people remember. They remember for their parents.</TE>
<TE>   'You could feel the electricity'</TE>
<TE>   Nobuko Miyamoto, 62, is a third-generation Japanese American and
founder/artistic director of Great Leap, a multicultural arts
organization in L.A. Miyamoto, whose 28-year-old son is half African
American, recorded a song, "The Chasm," in 1997 that addresses her
experience during the riots:</TE>
<TE>   "Driving my car through the war zone, I stop at a light.</TE>
<TE>   A young black man looks at me,</TE>
<TE>   Fire in his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   He sees in me the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   No time to say,</TE>
<TE>   'Hey, I loved Malcolm,'</TE>
<TE>   Or 'You could be my son.'"</TE>
<TE>   That day there were about six fires around here, and we were ready
to get on the roof because the wind was blowing. A couple days later
me and my friend got in her truck, and she had a camera, and of all
stupid things we drove down to South-Central, to the place where it
started and people were really hostile.</TE>
<TE>   You could feel the electricity in the air. We were stupid to have
a camera. We were shooting because I was preparing to do "A Single
Grain of Sand," my one-person show, which was going to have a lot of
video images in it. There were rows and rows of stores just in ashes,
and people were just looking in a very suspicious manner, and I guess
I was unaware.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they thought I was Korean, but nothing really happened to
us. They just said some nasty words, but I was really saddened by the
whole situation because I felt, "Wait a minute, you don't know who I
am. You don't know what my feelings are. You don't know." But it was
just a general thing. If you were Asian, you must be the enemy, so it
was a very tough experience for me, and that's where I got that line,
"Hey, I loved Malcolm. You could be my son." And I really felt like
that--you don't know who I am. You don't know my life. It sort of
deepened my resolve in a way to build more bridges between
communities.</TE>
<TE>   'People stopped respecting us'</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Det. Federico Sicard, 52, was assigned to the child abuse
unit/juvenile division in 1992. For the past six years he has worked
with the fugitive warrant section. He has been in the department for
21 years.</TE>
<TE>   I was at home watching the news, and I just couldn't believe it.
I'm from Colombia and was pretty much accustomed to that. Every time
the prices in the bus fare went up, the students used to go out and
riot. And if the teachers didn't get paid the proper amount, there
was a riot. I thought that was only in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   But I was seeing what was going on, and I felt sad. It's the city
of Los Angeles, the city that I work for. And then I was seeing it
wasn't the good people of South-Central who were creating all that
chaos. It was all the hoodlums. You saw the destruction and how many
innocent people were getting hurt.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't long after I started watching that I got a call to go
back to the office. We were put on 12-hour watches. We were sent to
South-Central, assisting the Fire Department because they were out
there putting out fires.</TE>
<TE>   We could hear shots being fired, and that's kind of scary because
you don't know where they're coming from. It was dreadful.</TE>
<TE>   I was with a big group of police officers. We felt pretty secure
among ourselves because we knew what we had to do and were trained
well. But the people did take it out on us verbally.</TE>
<TE>   I remember we were on Washington Boulevard and there was one fire
and the firetruck arrived, so we were protecting the truck and the
firemen. All of a sudden, two blocks down, another fire started. They
couldn't do anything. They were still putting out this fire, and
these were big fires. Stores were burning down. We had to go through
those dark alleys, hearing in the background those shots being fired.
That was stressful. It's like soldiers patrolling hostile areas.
You're just sitting there. Anything could happen.</TE>
<TE>   The next few days, it was like being in a storm or a hurricane.
The hurricane destroys everything, and then it's nice and quiet. It
was like that, except that it wasn't nice because there was a lot of
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   I remember a meat market; it smelled like a barbecue from all the
meat that had probably burned. Everybody was walking around. There
had been people looting and stealing, but after two days it went back
to normal. It was more under control.</TE>
<TE>   For me, what happened was just another verdict. I have seen in my
21 years individuals who molested children who got away with it on
technicalities. This wasn't different from that. But things changed
for us a lot. From that point on, people stopped respecting us.</TE>
<TE>   'It's made me more cynical'</TE>
<TE>   Grant Mudford, 58, an Australian-born architectural photographer,
lived and worked at 4th Street and La Brea Avenue at the time of the
riots. As chaos broke out on the street below his studio apartment,
all of his neighbors left, but he stayed.</TE>
<TE>   At about 2 that day, there were carloads of people circling the
building. All the shopkeepers had locked their doors and disappeared.
The people in my building decided to split and wanted me to split
too, but I had too much to lose. I had a life of work there, my
negatives, equipment, everything.</TE>
<TE>   Two friends eventually came by, and I loaded up some stuff into
their truck. The computer store downstairs was picked clean. I've
seen sharks feed in Australia, and it's a frenzy. Even when there's
no food left, they still go through the motions, and that's what was
going on here. It was very surreal to see people behave like wild
animals. They were laughing; it was like Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   At the height of the looting, an SUV pulled up, and a young guy
got out, knelt in kind of a combat position, pulled out a
large-caliber handgun and started shooting. That scared everybody,
but only for about 10 seconds. Then they came back again.</TE>
<TE>   I had a shotgun, and I stood outside on the balconies and made
myself and the gun visible. But I kept thinking, I'm making it
obvious that I'm armed, but what am I going to do about it? I know
enough about guns that you don't idly brandish them, because if there
are other people with guns, they're not going to be too idle about
it. Fortunately, I didn't have to deal with it, but it was really
scary.</TE>
<TE>   During all this I saw at least three or four police cars driving
up and down La Brea with no lights or sirens, and they weren't
turning their heads. Since then I've realized that when the stuff
hits the fan, it's everybody for himself. I guess it's made me a
little more cynical about human nature, and it reduced my confidence
in the capabilities of law enforcement. I don't blame them. I'd do
the same thing, I'm sure.</TE>
<TE>   'People were looking into faces'</TE>
<TE>   Charles Holland, a TV writer and producer, lived with his wife in
Century City in 1992. He was in a pitch meeting in Westwood when
someone mentioned that the television anchors were telling people to
go home. Holland left his meeting and tried to find a route that
wasn't completely jammed.</TE>
<TE>   I was on Olympic, I think, and this car ran a red light and
slammed into me. Now, I played football, so I've been slammed pretty
hard, and this was a good hit. I had double vision. But I looked over
at the driver, and I could see she was a young white woman, and she
took one look at me and I could see horror and fear just spreading
over her face, and she got the hell out of there. So my car was
totaled, and I imagine hers was too.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, my wife worked retail in the Century City mall, and
her boss decided not to close shop. I would go in to baby-sit her
because it was a ghost town at that mall, and she was scared. It
really was weird; it was me and her and another employee in the
store, and that was it.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of things changed immediately. For one thing, my wife had
always had trouble with [my] gun ownership, but she was pretty happy
about it then. And I noticed a lot of my friends were like that. It
was pretty clear that the police were busy, so they weren't going to
be able to get there if you needed them.</TE>
<TE>   And I noticed in the aftermath that there was a change being seen
across race. I had gotten used to the fact that people I would meet
in one context would simply not recognize me in another--walking down
the street, I was just a black man. But for a while that wasn't
happening. People were looking into faces as if they were looking for
something. And there were conversations, dialogues that had never
happened before.</TE>
<TE>   My wife noticed a higher level of civility; she says people often
don't respect her space because she is a black woman. They bump into
her or cross in front of her. But after the riots they were more
polite. I didn't notice that because I'm one of the boogeymen--people
always gave me lots of space. It did have an effect on the way police
treated people. Before that, I often got stopped by police, sometimes
right in front of my own place, and asked to justify myself. But
since then, that literally hasn't happened once.</TE>
<TE>   The conversations stopped, though, and people stopped looking
closer. Now we're back to the more incremental change--race relations
in this country keep getting better, but it's like a snail. Watch him
and it doesn't look like he's going anywhere, but take a nap and he's
crossed the road.</TE>
<TE>   'The bullet was in the baby'</TE>
<TE>   Neonatologist Andy Moosa was on duty at St. Francis Medical Center
in Lynwood on the afternoon of April 30, 1992, as a second day of
violence was exploding in the streets. Moosa, who had been at the
hospital for 26 years, was, and still is, the hospital's medical
director of the neonatal intensive care unit. That afternoon, he got
an emergency call about an extraordinary case: A pregnant woman was
on her way in from Compton. She had been shot through the abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   It was strange because when she was shot, she was going to the
supermarket--where the bullet came from, nobody knew--and she had
this white dress on. And she didn't feel any pain. She said she just
felt a jolt. And the white dress she was wearing--she was quite
pregnant, the baby was almost full term--there was this red spot in
the middle of her white dress just over the abdomen where the uterus
is. Her sister-in-law, who was with her, said: "You know, I think
you've been shot." So she sees this pool of blood coming through
because the bullet had gone in, but it had not exited. It had gone
into the uterus; we had no idea where it was.</TE>
<TE>   When we did an ultrasound, we realized that the bullet was in the
baby. We could tell it was lodged in one of the upper limbs. We
needed to get this baby out. So we were in the delivery room. The
baby looked great, except for the swelling in the right elbow, in the
fleshy part. It didn't even fracture a bone.</TE>
<TE>   By the grace of God, that [bullet] had been lodged in the soft
tissue, in the muscle. The baby was fine--breathing, crying, kicking,
and doing all these things, and it was a very positive thing because,
in all this burning and looting and people getting shot, here was
this new life. We removed the bullet from the soft tissue, stitched
it up again and everything was fine.</TE>
<TE>   There's always going to be a scar. That'll remind that child how
quickly [she] came into the world, in very unusual circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, being a Catholic hospital, [you think that] God is
always looking after us, that things just worked out for this brand
new baby, just coming into this world in a scenario of tremendous
violence.</TE>
<TE>   'We had nothing to do with it'</TE>
<TE>   Greg Stratton was mayor of Simi Valley for 12 years, from 1986 to
1998. As mayor he took pride in his city, home to the Ronald Reagan
Library and repeatedly named the safest city in America. Stratton,
55, is a software engineer who works for Northrop Grumman Corp. in
the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   I was mayor during the time, the troubles. I guess it started when
the trial came. They were attempting to get away from the L.A. media,
and then they thought Ventura. That might be logical, because the
county seat is farther away, but then the county turned right around
and reassigned it back to Simi Valley. So they basically pushed it
right back into the L.A. County media world. Nobody thought much
about what would happen if they were found innocent because everyone
kind of assumed they weren't going to be found innocent.</TE>
<TE>   And then, of course, the whole thing turned to the "evil" Simi
Valley jurors. That was the part that was our frustration, because it
wasn't just a Simi Valley jury, it was a jury from Ventura County. I
think there were two people on the jury from Simi Valley. We had
nothing to do with it other than we hosted the event down at our
courthouse. But that's not the way the press pitched it. And, oh, I
mean I got guys who were on cruise trips who would come back and say,
"You know, I was on a cruise and when I announced where I was from I
was booed."</TE>
<TE>   People were trying to call us all sorts of nasty names and trying
to make this out like it was a racial thing, in a community [where],
frankly, the color of your skin is far less important than whether
you keep your lawn mowed. Keep the crab grass out and your lawn mowed
and we don't care what color you are. And that is really true.</TE>
<TE>   Ten of the jurors came from other communities, including from
Oxnard and Ventura, and you certainly wouldn't say that Oxnard is
some sort of white racist community, you know?</TE>
<TE>   There were a couple of attempts to make some things between us and
South-Central. We had a baseball game between the police from Simi
and a team from South-Central, so there were those kinds of things
going on for maybe four or five years, until it died out because we
couldn't get sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   'I became aware of my race'</TE>
<TE>   A singer and songwriter, Shawn Amos, 34, lives in the Fairfax
district of Los Angeles. He is the son of Wally "Famous" Amos, the
cookie king. He was working at Touchstone Pictures when the riots
happened.</TE>
<TE>   I was the only black guy in my department, and I was at work that
day. I remember clearly that everyone looked at me in one of two
ways: Half were coming up and asking me to explain the reason for
what was going on--as if I had some special insight into the
situation because I was black. The other half were looking at me as
if I was the one who was out there looting the stores. That day, I
became aware of my race in a way I had never been aware of it before.</TE>
<TE>   I grew up, for the most part, in white, middle-class Los Angeles.
I was always accepted by everyone I came in contact with. But a line
was drawn in the sand on the day of the riots. I suddenly realized
how segregated this town really is.</TE>
<TE>   I went to school in Brentwood and Beverly Hills and Hawaii. My dad
was a kind of celebrity--Wally Amos. When you are a celebrity, you
become colorless to a degree. I mean, living that way, I did not
recognize my own blackness. I am still grappling with that. It's
become my cross to bear, to try to define what blackness means to me,
as someone who has had none of the quintessential black experiences.
That is the legacy of the riots for me. I was very privileged for a
long time. And I feel an obligation to pay that back in some way.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe in some way I can be a bridge for others who may not have
had the same benefits I did. I met a gentleman named Ageela
Sherrils--a former gang member. He runs a nonprofit group in Watts
called the Self Determination Institute. He was one of the people
responsible for forging the truce between gangs in Watts literally as
the riots were breaking out. I've asked him to mentor me. Because I
want to learn what's going on, what my place in it is, and how I may
be of service.</TE>
<TE>   'It was all about opportunity'</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Kang, 35, lives in Los Angeles and works as a broker's
assistant downtown. He was at work when the riots broke out.</TE>
<TE>   After the verdict came out, we heard screaming and yelling outside
the office windows. Then they started broadcasting all the violence
and looting going on. Downtown was filled with people passing out
pamphlets; signs were up everywhere that the judgment wasn't right,
that it was a black and white thing. At work, all of us were fearful,
thinking about how we were going to get home. Are we safe? Is my
family safe? Are my kids at school safe? What's going to happen?</TE>
<TE>   Coming back home on the 10 freeway, I got off at Crenshaw; the
minute I got off I saw a black cloud. It was a gas station on fire.
Wow, this is the real thing. A riot.</TE>
<TE>   In front of our house was a small aquarium store. They broke in
and started taking tanks and stands and everything. I took my video
camcorder out and taped the whole thing. The next day, I took it to
the owner and said do what you want with it.</TE>
<TE>   It was all about seeking an opportunity to profit for yourself.
Those people who looted didn't care what the judgment was. They saw
an opportunity for themselves, and they took it. That's the real
frustrating part. All these innocent, small-business owners, they
suffered. And why? If they think it's the wrong judgment, they could
have done something else. They didn't have to do it this way.</TE>
<TE>   'I am not going to die this way'</TE>
<TE>   Sylvia Castillo, 50, is a program officer for the California
Endowment, a nonprofit health foundation. Castillo lived in South
L.A. and was working at the Community Coalition for Substance Abuse
Prevention and Treatment at the time of the riots.</TE>
<TE>   We were waiting for the verdicts to come back. We had been driving
around the neighborhood, counting how many liquor stores were
concentrated in a 17-mile area of South Los Angeles. We were watching
people collect in the streets. We knew that if verdicts were "not
guilty" we would all go to the First AME church, and from there we
would get out in the community and try to engage in constructive
conversation with folks we knew. As organizers, we knew people had
moved beyond despair and hopelessness. Now they were feeling "what
the hell ... "</TE>
<TE>   Karen Bass, the executive director and founder of Community
Coalition, was in her car and I was in mine, following her. We went
down Florence Avenue. It's a pretty warm day. Windows up, air
conditioning on. We get to Florence and Normandie, and it seems like
there's a bit of gridlock. I see a crowd of guys with black pants and
white T-shirts in front of Tom's Liquor store. We were there earlier
in the day, and they were all outside there, drinking--and now
they're still there drinking. I look ahead and see Karen make the
right turn very slowly. Her hands are suddenly off the wheel, kind of
signaling people to stay clear of her car, as they run up to it--guys
mostly. She was signaling them to let her through.</TE>
<TE>   It happened so quickly. She makes the turn, and there are tires
burning on Normandie and a barricade also burning. I'm remembering
this in flashbacks, because what happens next is, I hear thump,
thump, thump and a lot of crashing. And I look into the mirror and my
face is bleeding. And the first thought I have is, "I am not going to
die this way." That was vivid.</TE>
<TE>   What had happened was my passenger-side windows had been broken
out. All the glass was inside my car. There were bricks and 40-ounce
bottles also thrown in my car. A man is trying to get into my car.
His upper half is in my car, and the other half is outside of it. He
yells, "Bitch, you're gonna die."</TE>
<TE>   So I hit the accelerator. I can't see anything in front of me
'cause the front window is totally shattered. I hit the gas, and the
guy goes out the window, but others are thumping against the car. I
drive really, really fast, even though I can't see.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily, I only had superficial cuts and bruises. I was willing to
talk [to the media], but the questions they asked seemed intent on
racializing the story. I am Latina, and they'd ask, "Can you ever
trust African American people again?" This was not a racial issue,
and they were trying to make it one.</TE>
<TE>   My anger forced me to take action. That's when I became director
for Rebuild South L.A. Without Liquor Stores--a whole new area of
work was born from that riot. It was born because residents didn't
want the same old stuff rebuilt, a return to the status quo.</TE>
<TE>   'We were calling the Ritz-Carlton'</TE>
<TE>   John Rechy, 67, has written 13 novels, many of which are set in
Southern California. One critic called Rechy the "steadfast champion
of the disregarded, no matter their gender or station in life." Of
Mexican-Scottish descent, Rechy teaches literature and film courses
for writers in the graduate division of USC.</TE>
<TE>   I suppose there was naivete among people like myself who really
felt that such an injustice couldn't occur. The fear came very, very
quickly, because you remember that televisions were placed now on
reactions around the city. Groups were glued to them, waiting for the
verdict. In the black sections there was this immediate, instant
rage. I remember thinking that for the next hours, days or however
long that mood lasted there would just be white faces and black faces
and it would not matter how sympathetic you were to Rodney King, and
what had been done, how angry you were, you were going to become the
enemy.</TE>
<TE>   I went up the stairs to look at Los Angeles burning, and it was
right here on Vermont. We were going to flee! But of course those
funny moments still anchor things. We were calling up the
Ritz-Carlton to see if they could take us. [Laughter.] These are the
defining moments that one grasps for, because it means that your
reality is still going on. The world is turning over, but, damn, you
are going to go to the Ritz-Carlton.</TE>
<TE>   I think that the outcry among white people, establishment people,
was very significant. It indicated, we realized, that we had been
naive all along, in believing that there would be a just verdict. Of
course, payback came with O.J. Simpson.</TE>
<TE>   For so many white people like myself, there was a disgust, and
also with oneself for thinking that things had been changed so
enormously, and yet here was this gross injustice being thrust on us.
You know, in a strange sort of way, it indicates the kind of
vitality, whether it takes the form negatively, or positively, that
is in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   'We prayed about it'</TE>
<TE>   Jude Tiersma Watson, 48, is an assistant professor of urban
studies at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena. In 1992, she was
a graduate student living in Westlake, a largely Latino immigrant
neighborhood in Los Angeles. She still lives nearby.</TE>
<TE>   I had been living in this Latin neighborhood for three or four
years as part of Inner Change, a Christian lay order that lives and
works among the poor. As the violence spread to our area, we started
getting all these calls from "the outside"--friends telling us we
should leave. But part of Inner Change's philosophy is to live here.
It didn't seem right that we could leave but our neighbors couldn't.
We prayed about it and decided to stay.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't feel personally in danger, although things were out of
control. Someone broke into the corner Swapmeet, a historic building
that housed lots of merchants, and then everyone went in and started
coming out with stuff. After the TV news announced that the Swapmeet
was being looted, people from other areas started driving through to
join in. Some guys in a small white pickup truck came by and threw a
Molotov cocktail into the building. The feeling of the whole day was
like something had been let loose--like the lid blew off the pot.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly it came out that the police were trying to retrieve some of
the things that had been looted from the Swapmeet and [another
shopping center]. They went through apartments and, whatever looked
new, people had to produce a receipt for it or the police would take
it. One 12-year-old boy I knew had a bike that his sister had given
him for his birthday, but there was no receipt, so the police took
it. Another neighbor was eight months pregnant, and the police took
her bed because it looked new. I called it reverse looting. For me,
that was as hard to deal with as being here for the original part.</TE>
<TE>   I worked really hard to get the bike back but never succeeded. I
don't know where all this stuff ended up. I have wondered about what
kind of message it gave to that 12-year-old boy about this country
and about the police.</TE>
<TE>   'We're losing control of the city'</TE>
<TE>   Richard Andrews, 60, works for a risk management consulting
company in Irvine. In 1992, he was director of the state Office of
Emergency Services, under Gov. Pete Wilson. When the riots began, he
had just returned to Sacramento after touring the damage from an
earthquake in Humboldt County.</TE>
<TE>   Through that first evening, there were a series of conference
calls between Gov. Wilson, Mayor Tom Bradley, Sheriff Sherman Block,
LAPD Chief Daryl Gates and, eventually, the adjutant general of the
National Guard. The thing that struck me was that of all the people
involved, the two politicians--Wilson and Bradley--from different
parties, both immediately recognized how serious the situation could
become, whereas the law enforcement people didn't. One of the law
enforcement people described the unrest as a "Mardi Gras atmosphere."
They tended to think they could handle whatever happened and that the
rage would dissipate during the evening.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, the most serious rioting occurred. I got a phone
call from one of Mayor Bradley's senior aides, who said, "We're
afraid we're losing control of the city." I was stunned. I couldn't
comprehend that the situation had gotten that desperate that fast.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Wilson decided to fly down, and I joined him. We landed at
Los Alamitos and then flew by helicopter to the LAPD heliport and
then went by motorcade to the emergency center in City Hall. I
remember the very strange feeling of riding through the empty streets
of downtown Los Angeles with police and Highway Patrol vehicles all
around us and the curtains closed on our vehicle. It was very
surreal.</TE>
<TE>   When we came from Sacramento, we had no idea how long we'd be
here. We stayed four to five weeks. I have a series of pictures from
that time, and I have the same suit of clothes on in every picture.
We were pretty much up 24 hours a day those first three days. You
operate a lot on adrenaline.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Wilson placed me in charge of negotiations between law
enforcement officials and the military. I had experience dealing with
all manner of natural disasters, but no one anticipated anything like
this. No one had experience dealing with U.S. troops on the streets
of an American city. We had troops that had been in Desert Storm. I
had to learn how to sit in a room full of military generals and say,
"The governor wants you to do this and this," and have them take me
seriously. It was the most intense period of my life and probably the
most gratifying because, in a real crisis, we managed to find our way
through it and felt we really did perform in ways that, before that,
I didn't think I was capable of doing.</TE>
<TE>   Once the rioting was over, we had assistance centers set up
throughout the areas affected, and I went to many community meetings.
In natural disasters, everyone in the community pulls together. Here,
it was just the reverse. The community was just fractured--the Korean
community, the African American community, the business community;
they were all polar opposites to each other. It was very clear a lot
of healing was going to have to happen.</TE>
<TE>   'My world was shattered'</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Rabinowitz, 53, founder of the Carole Little apparel
company, had spent more than a decade building his business at the
corner of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Main Street. Nearly
half of his 500 employees lived in the surrounding South-Central
neighborhood, and some of them came, shotguns in hand, to defend the
company headquarters against looters after they set fire to one wing
of the building. The company suffered $10 million in damages, but the
business was not an entire loss. Two years later, Rabinowitz showed
his gratitude by donating the property to the Accelerated School, an
independent charter school.</TE>
<TE>   I walked into the place, and there wasn't a piece of paper that
wasn't overturned, there were no computers left, things were
fire-ravaged. My world was shattered. I was angry, very angry, but a
good thing by a few people turned it around for me. When I saw that
the community had come to the aid of our building, I said, "These are
good people. There's some bad people here, but the town is full of
good people."</TE>
<TE>   The community did something for us, saying, "Thank you for being
here, thank you for being a good employer here." And we wanted to do
something to give back. Because this was really above and beyond,
although they didn't think so.</TE>
<TE>   I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. It taught me that
it's a community full of good people. I don't think violence is the
right thing, but I think it was an explosion of frustrations. There
are good people that are not being attended to.</TE>
<TE>   'It had a beauty to it'</TE>
<TE>   Artist Peter Alexander, 63, is known for his minimalist resin
sculptures and atmospheric landscapes. Alexander, who lived in Malibu
and had a studio in Venice, photographed televised images of the city
in flames that he shot from news helicopters. He used the photos to
paint a series of 18 black-and-white works called "Chopper."</TE>
<TE>   My father was born here, my grandfather was born here, so I'm the
third generation. The only advantage of being here is that you have
experienced this significant transformation of the city from sort of
a sleepy place to what it is today.</TE>
<TE>   So I suppose given that context, I think I perhaps was acutely
aware of changes that were occurring in the city. The city started to
get dark--psychically dark--probably in the late '80s, early '90's,
sometime in there. When it became sort of painful to live here,
that's when you knew it was a city. It got shifted from so-called
paradise to something that hurt. But it didn't lessen its magic, it
made it something that was more real. It put it in that world-class
category of Tokyo and London and New York and Paris and Rome. So when
the riots actually happened it was not a surprise.</TE>
<TE>   The only experience I had specifically around the riots was I
drove on the freeway, when there was sort of that lock-down period in
which nobody was out. It was absolutely incredible, because there was
nobody on the freeway and you could see the smoke looking south into
that part of L.A. The rest of the time I was watching TV, taking
Polaroids off the screen, hour after hour. It was absolutely
mesmerizing. There was no fear even. Maybe because we were seeing it
on TV. It had a beauty to it, that you could only sense because there
was no feeling, there was no smell. All I responded to were these
absolutely incredible images that were so beautiful because of the
fire.</TE>
<TE>   I distinctly remember within the period of a week I did all the
paintings. I just went bam bam bam bam bam. A lot of it was because
of the emotion of what had happened. I was still thinking of beauty.
I wasn't doing it to record like Picasso's "Guernica." My work was
never was about the horror. It made me sad.</TE>
<TE>   The riots made it very clear something was wrong. It was
unequivocal. It was part of the city becoming a city. Part of the
growing up. L.A. had to face that it's not all paradise.</TE>
<TE>   'A lot of people went to Malibu'</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, Jannis Swerman, 48, was the maitre d' at Wolfgang Puck's
Granita Restaurant in Malibu in 1992 and lived in West Hollywood.
Today she is director of communications at Wolfgang Puck Worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   When there was a crisis, we would try to keep the restaurant open,
to provide a service to the community. It ended up being a good thing
that we opened, because a lot of people had fled the city. A lot of
people who had second homes went to Malibu because that's where they
thought they'd be safe. The people there were aware of what was going
on, but not in the same way as people in the city were. A lot of
local people wanted to come for dinner, because they couldn't get out
to go into town. We were actually very busy.</TE>
<TE>   Our biggest challenge was to get our staff to the restaurant. We
had about 70 people working there then, and most of them came to work
on public transportation. A lot of the employees were coming from
places downtown where terrifying thing were happening. We just did
the best we could with a skeleton crew.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the people who came in didn't have a concept of how
difficult it was to keep the restaurant running. That's part of the
theater of a restaurant, to create an environment that makes people
feel they're safe and things are normal. I got calls at Granita from
people who said, "I've been calling Spago and nobody answers. I don't
understand. I need to make reservations." Hello? They didn't seem to
know that the city was shut down. One woman was very upset because we
didn't have creme brulee available. I felt like saying, "Do you know
what it took to even open the doors? There's a bigger picture out
there."</TE>
<TE>   'They felt guilty'</TE>
<TE>   Larry Fondation, 44, is vice president of Teachscape, a company
that trains teachers using the Web. In April 1992, he was a community
organizer in Los Angeles. He lives in Silver Lake.</TE>
<TE>   On the second or third day, I was talking to a priest at one of
the churches where I used to organize. He showed me all of these
boxes that people brought to the church--VCRs, TVs, stereos--with the
addresses of the stores that they had come from. They weren't signed.
But he could recognize some of the handwriting. They felt guilty, he
said, about what they had done.</TE>
<TE>   'The rage had been fomenting'</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Seiling, 34, is assistant box office treasurer for the
Center Theatre Group at the Music Center. He also teaches history at
Cypress Community College in Orange County. At the time of the riots
he lived in Koreatown and was a teaching assistant at USC, working on
a doctorate in American history. His students, studying the American
experience, had been discussing the stagnation of the civil rights
movement and whether another event might again propel civil rights to
the front of the nation's social consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   I had this sense that we were experiencing something that was
going to be talked about in history classes years and years down the
line. [In my class], which was predominantly Caucasian, there was a
sense of, why are these people destroying their own neighborhood?
There was a lack of understanding that the rage had just been
fomenting, fomenting, fomenting. I remember an African American
student saying, "You don't understand. You don't know what it is to
walk across the street and suddenly hear a car door lock click."</TE>
<TE>   About 10 years later, I was teaching at Cypress, at 9:30 a.m.
Sept. 12. I was supposed to talk about colonial foundations in New
England. I said we can talk about colonial foundations or we can talk
about what happened yesterday because that was truly historic. One
young lady said, "I don't have any idea what the hell I'm supposed to
think about what happened yesterday." And I was thinking, that's a
pretty good paraphrase of what people were saying 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Those two events are very much linked in my mind, historical
events that had a real impact on me. When I discuss them in class,
that's the way I discuss them--where were you? Do you remember the
riots? I've always tried to teach the civil rights movement as a
process of building things on the previous generation and what
they've done, and it certainly is a process unfulfilled.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years later, you don't see nearly the reaction we should have
had; that an explosion like that didn't produce substantive change in
race relations. It's sobering and disappointing. I don't have the
sense that [the riots] are going to be talked about like the Rosa
Parks' bus boycott, the Selma march.</TE>
<TE>   I think there's going to be another event that will force us to
change. The riots weren't it. That's my pessimistic view, the one
that says we missed an opportunity to rise above self-interest and
make social change. The optimistic view is that you look to the
students who seem to have a perspective that race shouldn't matter.
If they live their lives that way, there's the real change.</TE>
<TE>   If we don't have that change, we can't keep a lid on it.</TE>
<TE>   'We didn't see one police car'</TE>
<TE>   Frank J. De Santis Jr., 43, is executive director of a nonprofit
affordable housing development corporation. In 1992, he lived in a
hilltop home in Silver Lake, just off of Sunset Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   From my backyard, which has a view overlooking Sunset Boulevard,
we could see Korean liquor store owners on their rooftops with
handguns and rifles, shooting at looters. There was also a market at
the bottom of my street, where the owners circled the store with cars
and had guys out there with shotguns. It was like a wagon train.
Other buildings in the area were burning. But we didn't see one
police car, one firetruck or one ambulance until Sunday. Nothing. Not
even choppers in the air.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday at dusk, everyone on my block got together in the
center of the street and figured out who had what--first-aid kits,
water, food. And you wouldn't believe the number of guns that came
out. We blocked off the Sunset end of our street with old cars and
took turns that night checking IDs on anyone who tried to come
through. It was kinda silly because someone could've come in the back
way, but I think the looters weren't smart enough to figure that out.</TE>
<TE>   My feeling was that this was the end of Los Angeles as a great
city. I had lived on Edgecliffe Drive as a kid, from 1959 to '65 and
later bought the house [and two neighboring properties] from my
parents. I even remember tanks rolling down Sunset during the Watts
riots in 1965. But after this, I said, "That's it." I didn't want to
sell the houses, because that property had been in our family for 30
or 40 years, but I felt like if the city's not going to protect its
residents--if you can't get basic protections like police, fire and
ambulance--what's left? We moved to the Valley and by 1993 had sold
all three houses.</TE>
<TE>   'The human spirit thrives'</TE>
<TE>   Nancy De Los Santos,  a native Chicagoan, is a television and film
writer and producer of the upcoming HBO presentation of "The Bronze
Screen: 100 Years of the Latino Image in American Cinema." De Los
Santos, who worked as documentarian for KCET public television in
1992, lives in Echo Park.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone in Chicago was calling and saying, "You have to leave
immediately, you have to come home." I said, "No I don't want to
leave this place now." I felt the need to be a part of the healing
and not run from L.A. because the city was burning. I flashbacked to
living in Chicago as a young girl when Martin Luther King was
assassinated. We lived on a third floor of a high-rise building, and
we could see the cityscape from our window. In the distance we saw
the fires, other neighborhoods burning and all that came back to me
with the riots.</TE>
<TE>   I think the riots are always going to be there in the back of my
head, but yet, you go, "Wow, it's been 10 years," which always makes
you wonder: What has changed? How have all the communities been
affected? That's what I think about.</TE>
<TE>   A good question to explore is "Was it necessary? Were the protests
necessary? Did people really have to riot? And I say, "It was
absolutely necessary. Everybody needed to protest that decision
because in many ways it was such a slap in the face to all of us that
police could beat Rodney King to near death and then the cops could
be acquitted. Was protest necessary? Absolutely. Did it cross the
line? Yes, because it hurt the neighborhood and entrepreneurs so
badly.</TE>
<TE>   I think what I've learned since then is that the human spirit
thrives no matter what. That's what I see driving through Los
Angeles. But I think we also learned that there's still a lot of
misunderstanding, a lot of hate throughout this city and a lot of
friction. That still exists between the Latino and black communities.</TE>
<TE>   There is a lot of fear between those two communities: fear of
power, fear of loss of power, fear of control, fear of loss of
control, fear of economics, fear of political prestige. It's there.
It's bubbling. I wish that people would have a real discussion about
that because without such a discussion something very hurtful in the
near future could happen.</TE>

<LD>"Mean Soup"</LD>
<LD>   by Betsy Everitt</LD>
<LD>   Horace had a bad day. He forgot the answer to question three.
Zelda gave him a love note, and everyone teased him. Somebody in a
cow costume stepped on his feet. Horace felt so terrible that he
stomped on a flower and growled at his mother. But his mom had a
great solution--to make soup together.</LD>
<TE>   Read the book to find out the cool recipe that "stirs away a bad
day."</TE>

<TE>   "Click, Clack, Moo: Cows That Type"</TE>
<TE>   by Doreen Cronin</TE>
<TE>   Farmer Brown was mad because his cows liked to type. He heard
"Click, clack, moo" all day long. Then the cows said on a piece of
paper, "The barn is very cold at night. We'd like some electric
blankets." Then the cows wrote, "Sorry. We're closed. No milk today."
After that the hens were cold too. "Closed. No milk, no eggs," the
hens said.</TE>
<TE>   I liked this story, especially when the cows said, "Click, clack,
moo."</TE>

<LD>It is not the horror of the riots, but the heartbreak of the verdicts
that I remember most--the physical pain, like a blow to the chest,
that crept down through my stomach, weakened my knees, made my limbs
feel numb and my head dizzy.</LD>
<LD>   Not guilty, not guilty, not guilty, not guilty.... Ten findings of
innocence against four police officers on trial for the beating of
Rodney King. The jury had seen the videotape of a prostrate black man
being clubbed, kicked and stomped by police. But no one did anything
wrong, the jury decreed.</LD>
<LD>   All I could do was collapse at my desk, head pounding, legs
shaking, unable to speak, trying to absorb all the verdict said to
me: You don't count. A black man has no rights. The police can get
away with anything.</LD>
<TE>   At that moment--and just for that moment--I understood what bigots
must feel when they profess to hate all black people because of
something one black person did.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the benefit of hindsight, it is hard to look back on the
verdict and the devastation it unleashed and measure with any
certainty what the 1992 Los Angeles riots said about our city and its
multicultural legacy; what they taught us about human nature and our
own inhumanity.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers tell one story: Fifty-four dead, 2,200 injured, 8,000
arrested, $1 billion in property damaged by arsonists and lost to
looters during five days of rioting that began within hours of the
broadcast of the verdicts on April 29.</TE>
<TE>   But it is through personal recollections--in different voices,
from different perspectives--that we see its imprint on our hearts
and minds.</TE>
<TE>   There is no one answer, and there is no one story.</TE>
<TE>   On a sunny morning in Northridge, from our hilltop park along a
mountain ridge, I could see a smoky haze blanketing the city's
skyline miles away. But there were no fires on our suburban horizon,
no boarded-up windows or gutted buildings or sidewalks heaped with
sodden debris.</TE>
<TE>   The only sign here of the riots, then in their fourth day, was
what I brought to a child's birthday party: the lingering stench of
smoke in my hair from my time spent at work in the inner city.</TE>
<TE>   My daughter and I were at the park for a 3-year-old friend's
birthday party. I'd grown accustomed to us being the only blacks in
this crowd, but on this day I felt like a neon sign. Everyone around
us seemed to be on edge. One woman I barely knew rushed to greet me
with enthusiasm. Others turned awkwardly away, reluctant to meet my
eyes, uncertain what to say.</TE>
<TE>   Around us, knots of guests stood solemnly, murmuring about the
tragedy playing itself out "over the hill," in neighborhoods few of
them had ever actually visited.</TE>
<TE>   I took a seat at a picnic table, near two women I didn't know.
They were so deep in conversation, they didn't even notice me. "It's
such a shame what's happening," said one, shaking her blond ponytail,
eyebrows knitted earnestly. "It almost makes you wish that videotape
had never been made."</TE>
<TE>   It took a moment for her words to register with me: If only that
videotape had never been made.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't wish Rodney King had just been arrested and not
savagely beaten.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't wish that justice had been done in Simi Valley and the
policemen who beat him had been convicted.</TE>
<TE>   She just wished that the beating had not been caught on film, its
ugly reality not shoved down our throats, forcing us to confront what
we'd prefer not to know. We could have avoided this messy,
inconvenient riot if only the police had been allowed to terrorize
King in secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   Hers was a sentiment I could never have uttered, a thought that
would never have occurred to me. I do not have the luxury to presume
that what happened to King had nothing to do with me. Too many black
men I love--brothers, fathers, husbands, friends--have been harassed
at gunpoint, poked with nightsticks, spread-eagled on the streets by
overzealous police. Rodney King, ne'er-do-well though he was, had
become Everyman to me.</TE>
<TE>   And when King tried to quell the riots with his pitiful, plaintive
"Can we all get along?" plea, I wanted to say, yes, we probably can,
but only if some of us agree to bear injustice privately.</TE>
<TE>   At least this time the world was listening. It hadn't been that
way the year before, when the black community was rocked by the
killing of Latasha Harlins and the judicial absolution of Soon Ja Du.</TE>
<TE>   Latasha, 15, was shot to death shortly after the King beating.
There was a videotape in that case too. It showed the black teenager
and the Korean grocer arguing over a $1.79 bottle of juice. Latasha
threw a punch, Du threw a chair, Latasha put the bottle down and
turned to leave. Then, Du pulled a gun from under the counter and
shot the girl in the back of the head. Du claimed Latasha was trying
to steal the juice, but the videotape showed her approaching the
counter with the bottle in her backpack and $2 in her hand.</TE>
<TE>   A jury found Du guilty of manslaughter. But a white judge, who
could have sentenced Du to as much as 16 years in prison, placed her
on probation instead. Her penalty? Four hundred hours of community
service, the same sentence football legend Jim Brown would receive
years later for smashing the window of his wife's car. The Harlins
case hurt. But there was no riot, only rallies and marches and prayer
vigils and private tears shed by mothers like me, who wondered why a
black child's life was worth so little.</TE>
<TE>   The Rodney King beating seemed both tragedy and opportunity. As
the videotape played around the world, we rode a wave of
international outrage, convinced that this time no judge or jury
could deny the horror of what we all had seen.</TE>
<TE>   We were wrong. But, ever in search of the silver lining, some saw
the shocking acquittals as a chance to remedy our justice system's
deficiencies. National polls taken in the days after the trial found
that 86% of whites felt the verdicts were wrong, and more than
one-third of whites now believed the justice system was biased
against blacks.</TE>
<TE>   But the riots shifted our attention. With the first brick thrown,
fire set, beating delivered, we lost the opportunity for a clear-eyed
dialogue on racial inequality. And that's the overlooked tragedy, one
that may never be redeemed.</TE>
<TE>   After all, it is easier to rebuild a grocery store than to restore
a people's hope. Easier to unite to sweep littered streets than to
reconcile conflicting visions and racial animosity. Easier to condemn
the amorality of looting mobs than to recognize the pernicious flaws
of a system that fails to deliver justice- for-all.</TE>
<TE>   If there were chances lost, there were others taken. And there is
another memory I hold on to; when I lose heart, it encourages me.</TE>
<TE>   I recall the ashen faces of my white colleagues as we listened to
the verdicts. They, too, were rendered suddenly speechless--stunned,
ashamed, bewildered by what this judgment said about them and us.
There was not much we knew to say to one another. In those few
moments, a chasm had opened between us, and no one seemed to know how
to get across.</TE>
<TE>   I gathered my things in silence and made my way out of the
newsroom. In the hallway, I encountered a fellow reporter I'd grown
close to through the years. Our eyes met, and the awkwardness melted.
There were no questions, no small talk, no explanations. This white
woman understood.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry, Sandy," she whispered. "I'm so sorry." She opened her
arms and I leaned on her, and we both stood in the hall and cried.</TE>

<LD>Few groups let things go to their head in quite the same way as Las
Floristas: elaborate floral creations, sky-high and weighing in at 30
pounds, are the crowning glory of the annual Las Floristas Headdress
Ball.</LD>
<LD>   The recent gala, which raised $350,000 to support Children's
Charities at Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center in
Downey, was set in the International Ballroom at Merv Griffin's
Beverly Hilton. For the event themed "Midsummer Night's Dream," the
room was transformed into a fantasy Arden Forest.</LD>
<LD>   The 10 elaborate headdresses on parade at the April 19 event were
created by Southern California florists--all Rose Parade float
veterans.</LD>
<TE>   With the ever-escalating costs of fund-raising events, the
resourceful Las Floristas, which has been staging this floral
extravaganza for 64 years, struck a deal with the Muscular Dystrophy
Assn.: It shared florist Chris Matsumoto's lavish floral ballroom
decor with the MDA's benefit on the following night. The guests at
the Las Floristas ball were invited to take home the spring bouquet
table arrangements, but all else stayed in placed the next night.</TE>
<TE>   KNX-AM (1070) radio's Tom Hatten, a past ball host, was enlisted
at zero hour when scheduled emcee Stephanie Edwards had to undergo
eye surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the headdress creations was paraded for the more than 600
guests. Taking the sweepstakes this year was Duarte designer Frank
Garcia's "Mystical Rendezvous" worn by Kathy Wills. Runners up were
"Titania, Queen of the Fairies" worn by Linda Nies and created by
Modesto Busto, Michael Garcia and Eric Railer of Fountain Valley;
"Dreaming of a Faraway Land," worn by Susan Welch and designed by
Barbara Kishiyama, Ernie Olson, Joyce Kirchener and Penny Knight of
Cerritos; and "Orchids in the Moonlight," a pink confection worn by
Maggie Simms and made by Burbank's Clark Jellison and Kelly Burke.</TE>
<TE>   In judging in the guest headdress category (more manageable
creations worn by attendees), a man took home a prize for the first
time: John Greenwood sported his wife's concoction, a tower of ivy
titled "Jack and the Bean Stalk."</TE>
<TE>   Bert Boeckmann, owner of Galpin Ford, served as honorary chairman
of this year's ball. Sandy Wessel and Jade Higgins co-chaired the
event committee, which included Las Floristas president Julie Pejsa.</TE>

<TE>   Venetian Fans</TE>
<TE>   A weekend-long whirl of festivities hosted by the California
Chapter of Save Venice Inc. drew guests--some in elaborate period
costume--from around the world in the cause of preserving some of the
Italian city's monuments. The party circuit got underway April 18
with a cocktail party at Amanda and Nick Stonington's San Marino
home, culminating April 21 with dual garden parties at the homes of
Terry Stanfill and Matthew White. But the highlight of the series was
the Casanova Masked Ball.</TE>
<TE>   The events, organized by Ruth and Hutton Wilkinson, White and
Stanfill, raised more than $150,000 for the restoration of the facade
of the Scuola Giorgio degli Schivoni, a Venice landmark.</TE>
<TE>   "New York was never like this!" said Save Venice board chairman
Randolph Guthrie, as he surveyed the costumed partiers arriving at
the California Club, where they were greeted by a battery of masked
carnival figures flanking the staircase. At the top, Chinese Imperial
courtiers held golden chimes mounted on bird of paradise stems. In
the Grand Lounge a buff, bare-chested live Neptune was enthroned atop
an atoll of seafood.</TE>
<TE>   Following dinner--sea bass risotto, noisettes of lamb and
vegetables prima vera--ballerinas in tutus with gondolas on their
heads pirouetted around a smitten gondolier as a shower of paper rose
petals fell. As the dancers exited, a troupe of African drummers and
dancers burst on the scene to lead the crowd back to the Grand Lounge
for desserts, games and music: The dance orchestra played on until
the last of the nearly 200 guests was swept out with the rose petals
at 2 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Attendees at the event, which was underwritten by Tanqueray,
included Mollie and John Julius Norwich, Alice Newhouse and James
Charbonnet, Bea Guthrie, Deborah David and Norman Kurland, John
Loring, Barbara and Howard Brenner, Marika and Gian Luca Seguso,
Thomas Schumacher, Paolo Costagli, Courtenay Eversole, Pat and
Michael York, Peter Lai, Ellie Nordskog, Kathy and Bob Ray
Offenhauser, Barbara and Bruce Winston, Susan and Norman Barker,
Rachel and Alejandro Ortiz, Dawn Moore, Caroline Firestone, Kacey and

<TE>   Ties to Ireland</TE>
<TE>   Actor Gregory Peck and sportscaster Vin Scully, this year's
American-Ireland Fund honorees, share a common bond in their 50-year
careers. They're both incurable storytellers. "Most of all I want to
be remembered as a good husband, father and grandfather. But as an
actor, I want to be remembered for telling a good story. That's the
most important thing," said Peck in a video prepared by his daughter,
Cecilia. The actor was sidelined with bronchitis for the April 17
dinner at the Regent Beverly Wilshire, which raised more than
$200,000 for philanthropic programs throughout Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   "With actors, what really counts is what kind of men they are--not
the kind of men they portray. Greg is one of the finest men I've ever
known," said Peck's longtime pal Charlton Heston in presenting the
Lifetime Achievement Award.</TE>
<TE>   In accepting the award on Peck's behalf, his wife, Veronique, said
he "has always had ties to Ireland ... including his role in
establishing Ireland's first graduate film studies program at
University College Dublin and his support of numerous arts
organizations there."</TE>
<TE>   Scully, whose gift for Hibernian hyperbole has kept Dodger fans
smiling since 1950, received the fund's Hope and History Award. "He's
not just a sports announcer," said the fund's chief executive
officer, Kingsley Aikins, in conferring the honor. "He's a humorist,
a poet and a storyteller. The son of Irish immigrants, Vin
personifies the American dream."</TE>
<TE>   Clan Scully was out in force, led by Vin's wife, Sandi, and his
second cousin, Mary Freehill, the former lord mayor of Dublin, who
joined Aikins in presenting the award. Other guests included Tony and
Dennis Peck, Annette and Peter O'Malley, Terry and Roland Seidler and
Angie Dickinson. Also there: the high steppers from the O'Connor
School of Irish Dance and tenor Mark Forrest, who made some eyes
moist with his "Danny Boy."</TE>

<TE>   Wellness Gala</TE>
<TE>   More than 300 supporters of the Wellness Community Foothills
turned out for the 10th Annual Angel Gala held at the Millennium
Biltmore Hotel on April 20 to honor this year's Angel Award
recipients for their dedication to programs for cancer patients and
their families. Honored were Richard C. Gilman, president emeritus of
Occidental College; Donald L. Fuchs, a founding board member; and
Ruth C. Williamson, medical director of the Huntington Hospital
Radiation Oncology Center, who serves on the Wellness Community's
professional advisory board. Jane Bird chaired the gala with Marjorie
Rudolph, which raised more than $185,000.</TE>

<TE>   A Shared Cause</TE>
<TE>   Stage and screen actress Nanette Fabray joined with fellow
arthritis sufferers to help raise funds for services provided by the
Orange County branch of the Arthritis Foundation at "Destination
Paradise," a luncheon and fashion show held at the Hilton Hotel in
Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   As she mingled with 200 guests, Fabray, 81, confided that she has
arthritric spurs at the base of her neck that can cause paralyzing
pain.</TE>
<TE>   "I have great admiration for this auxiliary because the women work
so hard to help people with arthritis," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds of about $20,000 from the April 20 event will be used for
programs and services that teach arthritis patients how to manage
their pain and increase mobility.</TE>

<LD>   She had taken her bath. It made her warm and sleepy. It made her
skin smell like marshmallows or maybe vanilla pudding.</LD>
<LD>   She was wearing her pajamas that had pink bunnies jumping all
around. There were 20 bunnies just on the front. She knew this
because she counted them once.</LD>
<TE>   She brushed her teeth for two whole minutes and then stuck out her
tongue and brushed that too.</TE>
<TE>   She climbed onto Mama's lap for her bedtime story. Tonight Mama
read about a boy who didn't want to grow up. His name was Peter Pan,
and he knew how to fly.</TE>
<TE>   Mama closed the book and put it back on the shelf. It was time to
start the game. Lauren wiggled with delight.</TE>
<TE>   "I wonder who's going to be your bed buddy tonight?" Mama asked.
She looked around the room. "What about your beach ball?"</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, Mama," Lauren giggled. "It would roll right off the bed."</TE>
<TE>   "True," Mama said. "Well, what about your dollhouse?"</TE>
<TE>   Lauren giggled again. "It's too big and has sharp corners."</TE>
<TE>   Mama put her finger to her cheek and thought real hard. "I know.
You want Barbie."</TE>
<TE>   This time Lauren laughed out loud. "Not Barbie. Barbie doesn't
like it if her hair gets mussed. You know that!"</TE>
<TE>   "I had forgotten," Mama said. "Well, Raggedy Ann's hair is already
kind of messy. What about her?"</TE>
<TE>   "No," Lauren said. "She likes to stay up all night and talk to
Raggedy Andy."</TE>
<TE>   "My, this is a problem," sighed Mama. "I don't suppose you want
your firetruck or your jigsaw puzzle or your roller blades either."</TE>
<TE>   Lauren made the covers wiggle; she was laughing so hard.</TE>
<TE>   Mama frowned. "I don't know what else to suggest ... maybe your
Slinky?"</TE>
<TE>   Lauren couldn't wait any longer. She sat up in bed and held out
her arms. "Teddy! I want Teddy!"</TE>
<TE>   "Good choice!" Mama said.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren hugged Teddy. His fur was soft against her face and he just
fit the curve of her shoulder. She closed her eyes, knowing Teddy's
button eyes would stay open all night and protect her from anything
scary.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren was glad the bed buddy game ended the same way every night.</TE>
<TE>   She always chose Teddy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mary Louise Downer says her teddy bear is quite old. He has only
one ear but can hear just fine, and his button eyes can see in the
dark as well as ever. This story will be on The Times' Web site at
www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<HD>What's Lurking in the Web's Dark Corners?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We encounter the same people on the freeways and in the supermarkets.
But they don't behave the same.</LD>
<LD>   Pushing a shopping cart, people will make their way past others
saying things like "oops" and "excuse me." Pushing the gas pedal,
however, they're more likely to ... well, no need now to spoil a nice
morning, is there?</LD>
<LD>   There's a lesson here as we confront our national anxieties about
privacy. Many Americans are worried sick about the loss of privacy,
now more than ever. This unease is particularly acute among those
immersed in the Internet age. I'm afraid, however, that we're
confusing things in this discussion. We're mistaking anonymity with
privacy.</LD>
<TE>   Privacy is the right to be left alone. Anonymity is the peculiar
desire to be unknown and unaccountable, removed as it were, when we
intersect with each other. Privacy is a matter of private behavior.
Anonymity, whether achieved with an encasement of automotive sheet
metal or by the use of a spurious e-mail identity, is a public
concern.</TE>
<TE>   Why do you want an anonymous identity on the Web? So you can avoid
answering for what you say or do. Otherwise you wouldn't need this.
Last I looked, some Internet service providers offered subscribers
the chance at five different identities, perfect for all but the most
advanced cases of split personalities.</TE>
<TE>   As our daily experiences on the asphalt highways prove, there is a
little beast in most of us, maybe all of us. In some, it rages hot.
Anonymity, in the car or on the Internet highways, only encourages us
to act on our worst impulses. Anonymous Web users can send death
threats, invite illicit liaisons, masquerade and clutter the world
with blather and slanders. And they insist upon shielding this under
the umbrella of our "right to privacy."</TE>
<TE>   Here and there, a few plot crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Not only are privacy and anonymity different things, they often
conflict. Just look what a mess anonymous people make of public
restrooms, spoiling things for the next person who needs a little
privacy. Your ability to sound your way across the Web anonymously
means that you can harass someone else and intrude on their time
without being answerable. By what sensible measure can this be
defined by a word so noble as "privacy"?</TE>
<TE>   Legitimate announcements and news stories are hijacked from Web
sites and rewritten by anonymous mischief makers. Once in the vapors
of the Web, a stink arose when my byline was circulated over a
fabricated story about the president of the U.S. being a child
molester.</TE>
<TE>   The creative geniuses who have given us the Web still insist that
anonymity is one of its cornerstones. If so, the foundation is wormy.
The longer that Web-heads insist on anonymity, the more the
credibility and usefulness of their creation will be undermined.
Already, one of the first lessons taught in middle-school computer
labs is to regard everything on the Web as you might a puff
adder--apt to bite you at any moment. Is this the best we can expect
from the information revolution?</TE>
<TE>   But without a place to hide, you ask, what would happen to
citizens in countries where freedom of speech is a crime? I'll grant
you the argument. But I still believe that revolutions are started by
the brave, not the timid.</TE>
<TE>   I acknowledge: My own hands are not entirely clean on these
matters. The newspaper business trades on anonymous sources. I've
relied on them myself, though I think they've become too commonplace.
But such sources are not a cornerstone of the paper you hold in your
hand. Anonymous sources are not presented to you without a writer and
an institution putting their reputations on the line. Newspapers
still answer to the laws of libel and to the free-market imperatives
of trust.</TE>
<TE>   None of this is the case with anonymity on the Web. So instead of
worrying ourselves silly about ways to protect these few who are
afraid to stand up for their words and actions, we should be going in
the other direction: making it harder to be anonymous, marginalizing
those who try. We may never humanize the automobile, but we can the
future--by tearing down those barriers that shield us from each other
and tempt us to be our worst.</TE>

<HD>Next Chief's Duty Is to Exorcise Police Department's Demons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is good that Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks has chosen
to move on. Although Parks' downfall was not entirely of his own
making, I hope it is the last gasp of an old LAPD culture that
sparked the 1992 riots.</LD>
<LD>   I am not criticizing the city's current police force, whose
officers look more like the rest of L.A. than the LAPD has in maybe
100 years. I refer to the postwar LAPD built by the late Chief
William Parker and presided over by men he groomed as his
successors--such as Daryl Gates, who was the chief at the time of the
riots.</LD>
<LD>   Like Parker, that old LAPD was imperious, rigid and often bigoted.
And for all his claims to being a reformer, Parks clearly spent too
long--37 years--in the bosom of the old LAPD. How else can one
explain his stubborn resistance to civilian control, his
hypersensitivity to criticism and his slowness in making the changes
the LAPD still needs?</LD>
<TE>   Parks' critics often called him a "black Daryl Gates," but a more
accurate description would be a black Bill Parker.</TE>
<TE>   By laying the blame for the '92 riots on the LAPD, I don't mean to
dismiss other factors that clearly played a role. Economic
inequality, racial prejudice and plain criminality cannot be ignored.</TE>
<TE>   But too many recollections of the riots focus on those big social
factors, which merely fed the conflagration. What sparked the
violence was a series of abysmally bad decisions by LAPD
leadership--starting with the sergeant who should have done more to
control the officers who beat black motorist Rodney King on March 3,
1991.</TE>
<TE>   Slightly more than a year later, when four of those officers were
acquitted by a suburban jury, the LAPD decision-making was no better.
Within an hour of the verdicts angry mobs were taking control of
South-Central Los Angeles as LAPD units retreated to safety. Gates,
meanwhile, was breezily headed to a political fund-raiser.</TE>
<TE>   The scope of the anger on the streets was evident to anyone
watching TV, but by the time Gates and his staff grasped the enormity
of the situation, it was too late.</TE>
<TE>   Like Parker, Gates said and did many arrogant things during his
tenure as chief. But what perhaps cost Gates a lifetime job, and
eventually led voters to impose term limits on future police chiefs,
was the LAPD's failure to maintain order after the verdicts. The
city--indeed, the whole world--realized that the LAPD was a paper
tiger, its tough reputation sustained by old TV shows.</TE>
<TE>   The old LAPD no longer had the public support, much less the moral
authority, to control the streets of a new Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone watching closely saw that sea change coming as far back as
1965. The Watts riots that summer, also sparked by what started as
the routine arrest of a black motorist, were the first warning signs
that the LAPD's militaristic style of policing was becoming outdated.</TE>
<TE>   For the next 25 years, unresolved tensions left by the Watts riots
continued to simmer. They led to smaller riots in Century City in
1967, in East L.A. in 1970, at UCLA in 1971 and on and on. Yet Bill
Parker's successors stubbornly insisted that the LAPD's way was the
only way to keep peace.</TE>
<TE>   A final confrontation was inevitable. It was delayed for a few
years by the election of Tom Bradley, an African American, as mayor
in 1971. An LAPD veteran who left the force before its culture could
infect him, Bradley changed things on the margins. But even Bradley
could achieve only a standoff with the likes of Gates.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, L.A. continued to change. The mostly white,
middle-class and suburban city that had once supported the old LAPD
gave way to a new ethnic and economic mix. And the new L.A. would not
tolerate a police force that acted like an occupying army.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with 10 years of hindsight, it is clear that as awful as they
were, the riots were not really significant in and of themselves.
They were merely the final, bloody act of a very long and difficult
drama that began a generation earlier.</TE>
<TE>   May Bernie Parks be the last casualty of that long struggle. And
may he even find himself a more constructive role to play in the new
Los Angeles. It will be up to his successor to finally exorcise the
ghost of Bill Parker.</TE>

<HD>The U.N. Won't Investigate the Real Tragedy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>YOSSI KLEIN HALEVI</AU>
<BD>Yossi Klein Halevi is the Israel correspondent for the
New Republic and a senior writer for the Jerusalem Report.</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>The United Nations commission formed to investigate the nonexistent
Israeli "massacre" in the West Bank town of Jenin could have been a
means for some desperately needed truth-telling about the Middle East
conflict.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, given its mandate to focus on Israel's self-defense
rather than on the Palestinian terrorism that provoked it, the
commission will only confirm that there is no justice to be had in
the U.N. for the Jewish state.</LD>
<LD>   The commission won't be investigating how the Palestinian
Authority, established and lavishly funded by the international
community, abused its sponsors' trust by turning Jenin and other West
Bank towns into centers for suicide bomb factories.</LD>
<TE>   The commission won't be investigating how Palestinian terrorists
used civilian neighborhoods as shields for their death work and Red
Crescent ambulances to transport explosives belts into Israeli
cities.</TE>
<TE>   The commission won't be investigating the verifiable massacres
that have happened here in Israel's cafes and wedding halls, on its
street corners and buses.</TE>
<TE>   The commission won't be investigating the role played by Yasser
Arafat's official apparatus--his police and militias and intelligence
services--in planning, funding and recruiting for the suicide killer
operations.</TE>
<TE>   The commission won't be investigating how the internationally
recognized leadership of the Palestinian people nurtured a culture of
suicide among its young--for example, Arafat's televised plea to God
to grant him the martyrdom of the suicide bomber who killed 28
Israelis in the Passover massacre, or his wife's public lament that
she had no son to offer as a suicide killer.</TE>
<TE>   The commission won't be investigating the cultural infrastructure
that made terror possible--the Palestinian textbooks that exclude
Israel from the map of the Middle East, the Palestinian media that
proclaim that the Holocaust never happened, the Palestinian mosques
where preachers invoke God's blessing for those who kill civilians.</TE>
<TE>   The commission won't be investigating how donor nations,
especially those of the European Union, allowed the Palestinian
Authority to sustain a terrorist war for the last 19 months,
lavishing funds on a corrupt regime that devotes its budget to
building bomb factories rather than hospitals and schools.</TE>
<TE>   The commission won't be investigating the Arab world's culpability
in creating the Palestinian refugee crisis by rejecting the U.N.'s
own partition plan in 1947 and then maintaining the Middle East
conflict by rejecting President Clinton's peace plan that would have
created a Palestinian state on almost all the territories and part of
Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   The commission won't be investigating why much of the world's
media rushed to proclaim a massacre in Jenin without evidence, and
then appeared disappointed not to find mass graves beneath Jenin's
rubble.</TE>
<TE>   Neither will the commission be investigating itself to expose how
the U.N. has been hijacked by a coalition of international
dictatorships that have singled out Israel, which struggles to
maintain democratic norms under permanent siege, as the world body's
symbol of evil.</TE>
<TE>   It won't be investigating how a country such as Syria, whose
government routinely imprisons opponents and has sponsored the mass
murder of its own citizens, is given a seat on the Security Council,
to say nothing of its seat on the U.N.'s Human Rights Commission.</TE>
<TE>   And it won't be investigating the U.N.'s neglect of desperate
human rights issues such as the occupation of Tibet and of Lebanon
and the mass murder and enslavement of black Sudanese.</TE>
<TE>   Those are all issues that have been obscured by the U.N.'s
obsessive focus on Palestinian statelessness, which the Palestinians
refused to end through negotiation and compromise.</TE>
<TE>   The commission won't be investigating the real tragedy: how the
U.N. squandered the dream of a united humanity animated by justice--a
dream first offered by the prophets of ancient Israel--and instead
joined the unholy coalition of Islamic fundamentalists, far-left
moralizers and far-right neofascists in again targeting the Jewish
people.</TE>

<HD>The 'There' of Yucca Mountain</HD>
<DH>How can people back East justify putting a nuclear waste
dump in the Nevada desert?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF SCHUMACHER</AU>
<BD>Geoff Schumacher is editor and publisher of the Las
Vegas Mercury.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I was in sixth grade, we moved from Las Vegas to a remote
outpost about 80 miles to the north that didn't really have a name
when we arrived but later was dubbed Crystal, Nev., though it's best
known as the site of the Cherry Patch Ranch brothel.</LD>
<LD>   Many people are familiar with small-town life in southern Nevada,
whether it's Mesquite or Pahrump or Boulder City. Those places are
nothing like Crystal. Crystal was--and still is--about as far removed
from civilization as you can get while still having electrical power
and gravel roads.</LD>
<LD>   This was before cell phones, so we didn't have a phone (I think
there was one at the brothel--for emergencies only). Our mailbox was
15 miles away in Lathrop Wells, so we didn't check it every day. We
planted a rickety mobile home on a couple of acres of scrub desert
and ran the swamp cooler constantly to ward off the Mojave heat.</LD>
<TE>   We shared this patch of desert with about 30 or 40 other odd folks
who were attracted to the sparse population and low, low land prices.</TE>
<TE>   We slowly adapted to this lifestyle. My brother and I explored the
east end of the Amargosa Valley on our bikes, ran away from
rattlesnakes, shot baskets on an uneven dirt court, raised chickens
that a neighbor lady ended up turning into dinner. We went to school
25 miles away in Pahrump, which required a car ride of several miles
just to reach the bus stop on the highway.</TE>
<TE>   But what I remember most about our life in Crystal was how quiet
it could be. When you went to sleep at night, it was dead silent,
except for the occasional coyote yipping in the distance. It wasn't
the quiet you experience after midnight in suburban Las Vegas, where
there's always that discernible electrical hum of urban existence and
the inevitable whine of a distant motorcycle. It was pure silence.</TE>
<TE>   I've been unable to experience that quiet ever since. I listen for
it often, but it's elusive. Pahrump and Reno and Las Vegas, where I
have lived for the past 20 years, have seemed incredibly loud to me.</TE>
<TE>   I often think about Crystal in the context of the fight over Yucca
Mountain, where the Department of Energy wants to bury 77,000 tons of
high-level nuclear waste. For one thing, Crystal isn't far from Yucca
Mountain, and the aquifer from which it draws water surely would be
among the first contaminated with deadly radiation if Yucca Mountain
were to spring a leak.</TE>
<TE>   But the main reason Crystal comes to mind is that dump supporters
often refer to Yucca Mountain as being a wasteland only suitable for
a nuclear waste dump. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, in recent
House testimony, described Yucca Mountain as being in "the middle of
nowhere."</TE>
<TE>   I take those comments personally. First of all, there is an
assumption that "the middle of nowhere" is deserving of less
consideration than more populated locales. In fact, a strong case can
be made that "the middle of nowhere" should receive more
consideration, offering a profound experience that can be attained in
a rapidly dwindling number of places in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Second, it assumes that the relatively small number of people who
do live in the area are deserving of less consideration than the
large numbers of people congregating elsewhere. How can such a moral
equation be justified?</TE>
<TE>   It's the same assumption, by the way, that led to thousands of
people in eastern Nevada and southern Utah being exposed to
cancer-causing radiation blown downwind from above-ground nuclear
tests in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there is the assumption that the Nevada desert is an
appropriate place for a waste dump. This is an outdated value
judgment by people back East, a judgment suggesting that if only
Nevada were covered with trees and grass and lakes and rivers it
would be excluded from consideration for the dump.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the desert contains its own wonders and ecological merits
that are no more or less valuable to the world than the lusher
attributes of the East.</TE>
<TE>   There are dozens of ways to see Yucca Mountain as a mistake, a
government boondoggle of massive proportions. But in my own head, I
think about it in the context of those silent nights in Crystal,
where you could always hear yourself think.</TE>

<DH>For generations, our national girth was held in check by
two larger forces: It was easy to spend excess calories and hard to
buy them.</DH>

<BD>Greg Critser is the author of "Fat Land," which will be
published this winter by Houghton Mifflin.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hardly a day passes now without a new study or warning about the
medical consequences of obesity. Unfortunately, such proclamations
will likely have a limited impact on changing the behavior that
causes us to be fat. Why? Because they do not address a prime reason
so many Americans stay fat these days. It is this: Being fat--at
least so far--makes economic sense.</LD>
<LD>   Think about it in terms of classic supply and demand. For
generations, our national girth was held in check by two larger
forces, the high cost of processed foods and food eaten away from
home--at restaurants and, later, fast-food joints--and the high
expenditure of calories on the job. It was easy to spend excess
calories and hard to buy them.</LD>
<LD>   But beginning in the post-war period and accelerating quickly in
the early 1980s, great advances in technology threw those forces out
of whack. As two economists point out in a recent Rand paper,
technological change "raised the cost of physical activity by making
household and market work more sedentary and has lowered the cost of
calories" through gains in agricultural efficiency.</LD>
<TE>   Think of it another way. In the past, we used to get paid for
expending calories; now, we get paid for being sedentary. It's part
of the job description. "Demand" for weight is up. We, as the
"sellers" of our weight, like it that way, and so we resist any
attempt to alter our "market." On the supply side, ubiquitous
"super-size" options provide an economy of scale for overconsumption.
This means that you can talk to us about the benefits of weight loss
until you're blue in the caboose--and we'll still be munching Fritos
all the way to the Barcalounger. After all: It's so cheap to be fat!
Slimming down--that's a pricey and time-consuming thing, and its
benefits are so abstract.</TE>
<TE>   But what if we experienced things differently? What if we felt the
true cost of eating high and living large? (Other than not being able
to wear any clothes from Banana Republic.) Would that help shift us
back to balance? A growing number of folks who deal with the medical
consequences of obesity are proposing ways to do just that.</TE>
<TE>   Here in California, state Sen. Deborah Ortiz (D-Sacramento) has
introduced legislation (SB 1520) that would levy a tax on all
non-diet soft-drink sales, designating the funds for programs that
treat and prevent obesity and tooth decay. The tacit message of such
a tax--both to sellers and consumers--would be similar to the tax on
cigarettes: If you want to play with fire, you've got to pay the full
price. Gauging by the number of attorneys for the beverage industry
who showed up in Sacramento for last week's hearing on the bill--and
the invective they leveled--some part of the message is getting
through.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, even if SB 1520 is passed--a good thing if only for the
health-care revenue it would raise--such a tax will not discourage
most consumers from drinking their daily Big Gulps. Indeed, even as
the legislation looms, fast-food outlets are pushing ever-larger,
ever-cheaper fixes. Controlling the impulse to gulp would require
another kind of cost-obesity consciousness. In essence, we must find
a way to get middle- and working-class folk, many of whom still think
of exercise as something that, according to one recent survey, "may
do as much harm as good," to think about food and exercise the way
their more affluent counterparts do. It may sound elitist, but it is
hard to deny: Old-Money folks--both those who've had it for a long
time and those who want to live long enough to think of themselves as
such--have always known that one price of abundance is restraint.
They also know that the price of leisure is vigilant--and
vigorous--exercise, which is probably why JFK was such a natural
early fitness advocate.</TE>
<TE>   One way to implant such a consciousness, says James O. Hill,
associate director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the
University of Colorado at Denver and one of the reigning deans of
modern obesity studies, would be to give everyone an inexpensive
device known as a step meter, which counts the number of steps its
wearer takes on any given day. (The professor already has distributed
6,000 in his home state). The goal would be 10,000 steps--an amount
equal to the surgeon general's recommendation of 30 minutes of
moderate to vigorous exercise, daily. If anything, such a device--as
I discovered--would remind us just how sedentary we are.</TE>
<TE>   That such cognitive approaches mark a turn back to behaviorism.
That they can work in practice was demonstrated, albeit on a small
scale, by the eminent British obesity scholar John Garrow. In the
late 1970s, Garrow was looking for ways to prevent his slimmed-down
patients from lapsing back into overeating. In a famous experiment,
he equipped one group with elastic waistbands, tied just tight enough
to become uncomfortable if subjects began to gain weight. The other
group went band-free. The results were unequivocal: In the control
group, the predictable weight gain commenced full throttle. In the
group with the waist cords, however, there was no significant weight
gain. And the effect seemed to be a lasting one. Patients were
continually reminded of the cost--in discomfort--of overeating.</TE>
<TE>   The "true-cost-of-fat" equation could also be applied to the
workplace. Hill would have most employers, who require their workers
to be sedentary, begin to pay the full cost of maintaining such a
workforce. "So far, they have gotten off cheap," he says. If people
spend at least half of their waking hours at work, why shouldn't they
get a 15-minute fitness break? And since daily fitness hinges in part
on access to safe sidewalks and walking areas and even parks, why not
require large businesses wishing to expand to file a "healthy
environment impact report," or HEIR, showing how they would provide
such essentials. Think of it as a kind of Occupational Safety and
Health Administration for the office worker.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, where an increasing number of low-wage workers
hold sedentary jobs, a HEIR requirement might go a long way toward
helping to redress age-old class imbalances in access to safe
recreation space. As an investment in public health, it would make
enormous economic sense. More playgrounds, parks, pools and gyms
would be an effective tonic to today's most vexing, if unrecognized,
job hazard: fatness. Let's get stepping!</TE>

<HD>Guatemala's Kids Cry Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Reuters reporter recently asked Guatemalan farmer Luisa Vazquez how
many children she had. "Three dead and four living," she answered.
What killed them? The answer could be seen in the telltale swollen
belly of the toddler clinging to her leg: easily preventable
illnesses brought on by malnutrition.</LD>
<LD>   Vasquez's story is far from unique. Between last September and
February, at least 126 malnourished Guatemalan children have died of
common colds or because they were too weak to swallow. The United
Nations World Food Program says that 60,000 children under 5 in that
Central American nation suffer malnourishment so severe that it
threatens to kill 6,000 of them in the coming months. A widespread
problem in many Latin American countries, chronic malnutrition
hinders children's mental and physical development. In Guatemala, the
level of children under 5 with acute malnutrition--the point where
the spiral toward death begins--has climbed from 2.5% three years ago
to nearly 16% today.</LD>
<TE>   Guatemala stands out in the region for two reasons: the severity
of the hunger and the lack of government response to those afflicted.
These are mostly poor rural families beset by natural disasters like
Hurricane Mitch, which hit in 1998, and serious droughts in the past
two years that have wiped out their meager subsistence crops. Also, a
sudden drop in coffee prices on world markets has caused more than
half a million people to lose their jobs picking coffee in the
highlands.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N.-sponsored World Food Program has appealed to the
international community for food and cash. Almost 9,000 metric tons
of food--about 400 boxcars--is needed to feed the children for six
months. This would cost about $5 million. So far, the only government
response has come from the U.S. aid agency.</TE>
<TE>   Guatemalans in the United States send approximately $584 million
annually to relatives in the homeland. We encourage them to prime the
pump of international donations to the relief effort. And we urge
others to follow suit, so that the children of Guatemala soon get the
food they so desperately need.</TE>

World Food Program may be mailed to P.O. Box 11856, Washington, D.C.

<LD>On certain blocks, young black men, some righteously enraged by
injustice, some merely frenzied, dragged people from cars and beat
them. Men, women and children--Latino, black, white--dragged stereos,
jeans and disposable diapers through stores' broken windows. By the
third day of rioting, the view from a helicopter was of fires
smoldering over 163 square miles--an area the size of three Bostons.
About $1 billion in property was stolen or smashed or went up in
flames.</LD>
<LD>   No one who was here 10 years ago will forget. But more important
now is to remember what the city was like before those days and
nights of anarchy, to consider how it has changed, to imagine what it
might be like 10 years from now.</LD>
<LD>   The inchoate frustration in the hardest-hit neighborhoods followed
years of disrespect and disenfranchisement: by police, corporations
and civic leaders. Too little has been done to improve a police force
that was often rude, if not brutal. Too few jobs have blossomed in
the ashes. But the recovery, while incomplete, has been substantial.</LD>
<TE>   About 85% of the 1,118 damaged or destroyed properties surveyed
afterward by the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety have
been rebuilt. And the rebuilders didn't come from Washington, despite
promises from hordes of elected officials who paraded through the
rubble, prayed at First AME Church and held press conferences.</TE>
<TE>   Rebuild Los Angeles, created by then-Mayor Tom Bradley and
then-Gov. Pete Wilson, helped to fill the void with an economic
recovery targeted at encouraging private investment. RLA channeled
more than $350 million in corporate investments into rebuilding,
developing and expanding businesses. It also supported job training
like the Toyota- Urban League partnership, which in June will
graduate its 1,000th mechanic.</TE>
<TE>   Such slow but significant change is raising the quality of life in
other ways too. Take, for example, the return of supermarkets to the
Crenshaw District and South-Central Los Angeles--32 since the riots.
RLA started a trend continued by private developers. In South-Central
Los Angeles, at Slauson and Western avenues, Chesterfield Square
offers a Home Depot, Starbucks and Subway. A Radio Shack and an
International House of Pancakes are planned.</TE>
<TE>   The chains have rediscovered what the mom-and-pop stores already
knew: There's much money to be made in the central city.</TE>
<TE>   Many Korean Americans, like immigrants before them, had staked
their economic future on small, family-run shops. They were
convenient targets for the rioters; about two out of three businesses
destroyed were Korean-owned, according to the KoreAm Journal. Today,
many Koreans feel worse off. Hundreds of families lost their
livelihoods, their homes and their faith in the American dream.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't acceptable. Ten years from now, everyone in Los Angeles
should have reason to share in the optimism of many Latino and black
families. Buoyed by a rebounding economy, homeownership is up. A
working father can pick up milk without driving miles out of his way,
and his children now have reason to stay in neighborhoods that were
bleak long before the riots.</TE>

<LD>In 1861, Mark Twain wrote that Lake Tahoe, 22 miles long and 12 wide,
was so clear that even at a depth of 80 feet "every little pebble was
distinct, every speckled trout." A dozen years later, geologist John
LeConte lowered a white dinner plate into the water. It was still
visible at a depth of 108 feet.</LD>
<LD>   That was before the forests were clear-cut to provide timber for
the Comstock mines, before grazing livestock polluted streams running
into the lake and before the urbanization of the Tahoe Basin. The
basin population grew fivefold between 1960 and 1980 and is more than
50,000 today.</LD>
<LD>   By the late 1960s, the dinner plate was visible to only 90 feet.
Tahoe was in crisis--a possibly irreversible clouding of the pristine
waters by pollution-caused algae. Then big government stepped in and
a slow success story began.</LD>
<TE>   The latest development is the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark
decision last week to uphold the authority of the California-Nevada
Tahoe Regional Planning Agency to halt home construction in the Tahoe
Basin while it develops a plan to reduce lake pollution. The decision
has no immediate effect because the moratorium occurred years ago and
the lands in question were never built on. But the ruling is
monumental in a broad sense because it upholds the power of state,
federal and local government to restrict land uses to protect the
environment.</TE>
<TE>   The planning agency was created by California, Nevada and Congress
in 1969 after Govs. Ronald Reagan and Paul Laxalt held an urgent
summit at the lake. They agreed that the only solution was creation
of a super- government agency, even though that concept violated
their conservative beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   The lake, at 6,225 feet elevation, and its surrounding ridges and
peaks, rising to 11,000 feet, were abused for 150 years. They will
not heal quickly even with planning and growth-control regulations
that are among the nation's most stringent.</TE>
<TE>   It's been a long struggle against erosion, sewage effluent,
casinos and landowner lawsuits. Federal, state and local governments
have spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying land and developing
erosion control and wetlands restoration projects. Hundreds of
millions more are needed.</TE>
<TE>   The dinner plate was visible to only 64 feet in 1997. But this
year, the figure is up to nearly 74 feet. Does that mean all this
effort is finally paying off? Too early to say. Planners say the lake
is quick to react to negative changes in the watershed--one year's
higher-than-usual runoff, for example--and very slow to respond to
restoration efforts. But it will. And there's no doubt that without
the planning agency, the controls and all the effort of the past 30
years, Lake Tahoe would have deteriorated to well beyond the saving
point.</TE>

<LD>Re "Landowners Dealt a Blow by Justices," April 24: I think it's time
we moved away from absolute property rights in this country.
Landowners should not have unlimited power to pollute Lake Tahoe or
any other natural area. People should not be allowed to buy up
forests and cut them down, destroying natural life forms, just
because they own the land.</LD>
<LD>   Ownership should mean stewardship of the land, holding it and
protecting it for future generations and honoring the land itself and
the nature that sustains us. Just as we take children away from
violent and abusive parents, we should protect the land from abusive
owners.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The 6-3 Supreme Court ruling that upheld such land-use planning
tools as a temporary moratorium on building that does not result in a
"taking" under the meaning of the 5th Amendment to the Constitution
was a welcome and unexpected decision, given this court's previous
rulings.</TE>
<TE>   It must be remembered that owning a piece of property guarantees
some use of the property. Nowhere in the Constitution, however, is
there a guaranteed right to make a killing. Speculative developers
might wish to keep that in mind in the future.</TE>

fliers" program can't come soon enough. For some unfathomable reason,
I have been matched "to a profile of suspicious activity." When I
check in, inaudible bells begin to ring and I am singled out. My
suitcases are searched top to bottom. "We need to get to the suitcase
lining to look for concealed weapons," said the officer unpacking my
things.</LD>

shoe removal. All this when I am the least-possible example of a

children who are all good citizens of California. I have seven
grandchildren, went to Hollywood High and have lived in Southern
California all my life.</LD>
<LD>   I had never flown until two years ago, when I met a retired

<HD>GED in Spanish Is No 'Passport Out of Poverty'</HD>

<LD>Re "Program Helps Migrant Workers Earn a GED," April 24: While I
admire the tenacity and work ethic of the Toxquis in pursing their
dreams for a better life, as a 30-year teacher of adult English as a
second language, I was appalled to read that the GED they earned was
studied for and taken in Spanish. It took them "three to five
months."</LD>
<LD>   What lesson does this tell my non-English-speaking students at
Evans Community Adult School? They come from 80 different countries
to study English. It often takes them more than four years and they
do "get frustrated." But they don't give up. Often they pass the GED
and continue on to get an American high school diploma. But their GED
and the high school classes are all in English.</LD>
<LD>   Your article seems to imply that the GED the Toxquis earned is
equal to the GED achievement of my students. What an insult to my
students! They know that the "passport out of poverty" is fluency in
English and that it does take a long, long time to achieve--and they
do not give up.</LD>

<LD>Re "Faith in the City and in the Future," April 25: Ira Yellin has
already succeeded in building what matters most--a lasting legacy
through the values that he exemplifies. His civic passion was
unmistakably clear in the only meeting I have ever had with him, a
one-hour, one-on-one talk more than several years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Physical structures are temporary, but fundamental human values
are forever. In his quest to create a wonderful heart of the city,
Yellin's humanity represented the wonderful heart that more Angelenos
need to strengthen the city's core. As a positive source of meaning
for many, his value structure will endure.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Parks Hangs Up His Badge," April 23: Now that outgoing Police
Chief Bernard Parks has decided against suing the city, he seems
poised to seek temporary refuge on the L.A. City Council, where he
can rail against Mayor James Hahn and lay the groundwork for a
mayoral run in a post-Valley-secession Los Angeles. With blacks
having a far greater voting bloc in a reconfigured L.A., it seems
Parks is far from retiring from public life.</LD>
<LD>   The true irony will be chief executive Parks explaining to the
press why he, as a new mayor, should have the right to choose who
will be the city's chief law enforcement leader.</LD>
<LD>   Nick Antonicello</LD>
<TE>   Venice</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When he announced that he is resigning as LAPD chief and may run
for City Council, Parks was not really, as reported, "hanging up his
badge." Instead, he is definitely continuing his stubborn battle
against reform and furthering his image as an egocentric political
cynic.</TE>

<TE>   Retiring Chief Parks is decidedly a class act. The powers that be
may name a successor, but to locate a "replacement" will be a
herculean task. Many times we do not truly appreciate what we have
until we lose it.</TE>

<LD>In Earl Ofari Hutchinson's April 24 commentary, "10 Years After the
Riots, We Stick With Our Own," he states, "The Los Angeles City
Council should revive its 'day of dialogue' forums, which brought
together community leaders and residents from throughout the city to
discuss their problems and needs." I am pleased to report there is no
need to "revive" the forums because the Days of Dialogue program has
been very active in Los Angeles, Carson, Inglewood and Pasadena.
Within the last year there have been more than 50 dialogues
surrounding the issues of racism after the terrorist attacks of Sept.
11, race relations, sexual abuse, youth leadership and more.</LD>
<LD>   Recognizing that the 10-year anniversary of the civil unrest is an
important time to reflect on race relations, there will be 13
dialogues throughout Los Angeles in connection with the Open Museum's
exhibit of personal objects and stories, called "Remembering the
Riots." For more information regarding Days of Dialogue, call (213)
439-9640, ext. 27.</LD>

County is home to the largest paid arts internship program in the

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Cardinals Call for Policy to Defrock Abusive Priests," April 25:
So, the Catholic Church feels it can put an end to this scandal by
agreeing to dismiss any priest "who has become notorious and is
guilty of the serial, predatory sexual abuse of minors." And the
church decides who is a serial abuser and who isn't? And the
first-time abuser gets a walk? I don't think so.</LD>
<LD>   The church's first obligation is to protect the community. Its
leaders' first step must be to turn an alleged child abuser over to
the police--the first time. Let a jury decide whether the man is
guilty. If it decides he is not, everyone can apologize. If it
decides he is, then he can go to prison, where he belongs, where he
will no doubt learn the real meaning of abuse.</LD>
<LD>   Defrock? Who cares? In or out of the church is not the issue. The
issue is in or out of prison.</LD>
<TE>   Bart Braverman</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jesus said it's better to be thrown into the sea with a heavy
millstone around your neck than to cause children to sin. Any priest
who molests a child even once is not fit for the clergy. The American
cardinals' refusal to remove "first-time" pedophile priests is a sign
that the problem is either in epidemic proportions or clergy are held
to lower standards than regular citizens.</TE>
<TE>   I suppose nobody would mind if "first-time" pedophile policemen,
Boy Scout leaders, judges, baby-sitters, etc., were given a stern
warning not to do it again. How absurd for criminals and perverts to
hide behind the cloth, and how insane for the church to protect
them.The American cardinals should be arrested as accomplices to
child molestation for knowingly allowing pedophiles to operate within
the ranks of the church and granting all priests a "one time only"
fall from grace. There is nothing that needs to be purged faster than
a false witness. How many lost their faith because a man of God
molested them?</TE>
<TE>   Lionel De Leon</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Notoriety? That's the new standard? After all the protestations of
caring for the victims of priestly abuse, all that our U.S. cardinals
have come up with is that an ordained molester will be dismissed only
when his case becomes "notorious" enough. I guess Cardinal Roger
Mahony's revealing e-mails were right about one thing. It's all about
the PR. With the cardinals' return home, my faith remains unshaken,
but I have never been so ashamed of the leadership of my church.</TE>
<TE>   Tom O'Brien</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Imagine a school district that crafts a child sexual abuse policy
that states that if a teacher abuses or rapes only one student, the
teacher can stay on in good standing but if that teacher abuses or
rapes many students, then the teacher most go. This is precisely what
the church is proposing. The church's policy should not be tolerated
by Catholics. I would go so far as to say that the church itself
would not tolerate such a policy if there were an ample supply of men
in the priesthood. Deviant priests would be expelled quickly.</TE>
<TE>   If the church were to change its stance on celibacy, we would have
an ample supply of men entering the priesthood and we would have a
true "zero-tolerance" sexual abuse policy. For me, that answers Ellen
Goodman's question (Commentary, April 25): "What's celibacy got to do
with it?"</TE>
<TE>   Mary Ellen Barnes</TE>
<TE>   San Pedro</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's no doubt that celibacy frees priests to devote themselves
more to the church family. However, celibacy is not a requirement for
all in the priesthood. Married converts (Anglican, Eastern Rite,
etc.) are accepted in the U.S. priesthood--and these married priests,
performing their priestly duties and living the sacrament of holy
matrimony, are no less holy than their brother priests. The holy in
the church laity are no less holy. Holiness comes from God and exists
in all callings and in service to all God's children.</TE>

<HD>Three Leaders Left in the Lurch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL BOYARSKY</AU>
<BD>Bill Boyarsky, former columnist and city editor at The
Times, is a senior consultant for the Center for Governmental Studies
and teaches political science at USC. He is writing a biography of
former political leader Jesse M. Unruh.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By coincidence, three of Los Angeles' most powerful leaders find
themselves in trouble at the same time, caught in a tide of history
that would challenge even the most skilled politician.</LD>
<LD>   When the L.A. region was a simpler place, Mayor James K. Hahn
might have escaped heavy criticism for his ungainly move against LAPD
Chief Bernard C. Parks. Parks would not have been harassed by
disclosures of police brutality at one of his department's divisions,
because such conduct was seldom reported. And Cardinal Roger M.
Mahony would not have had to deal with both a skeptical press and
parishioners concerned about the cover-up of priestly child
molestation.</LD>
<LD>   That was the L.A. of 40 years ago. The city and its suburbs were
more stable. It was before powerful social, demographic and economic
forces ripped through them, before they were covered by skeptical
journalists with a taste for blood and a medium, television, that has
exceeded the influence of the press lords of an earlier day.</LD>
<TE>   The demands on leadership have become much greater in a place now
divided by many ethnic groups, by extremes in economic class and by
geographical breakaway movements in the San Fernando Valley,
Hollywood and the harbor area. Parks, Hahn and Mahony have responded
to the city's plethora of narrow constituencies in his own way. The
question is whether their leadership styles have met the challenge of
the new L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, on the first night of rioting, Mayor Tom Bradley
led civic powers at a meeting at the First African Methodist
Episcopal Church designed to calm the community. This was the old
L.A. way--the empowered, operating top-down, urging calm.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't work. The words of Bradley, who once had a perfect sense
of L.A.'s changing currents, and of other older black leaders went
unheeded. Soon after the meeting broke up, fires moved up from West
Adams Boulevard toward the church, consuming apartment houses around
it. I watched African American men from the church and Latino men
from the apartments fight the fires with garden hoses, with no police
or firefighters in sight.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles had changed in ways that we are still trying to
comprehend. Fighting a fire was easy. African Americans and Latinos
looting stores was harder to deal with.</TE>
<TE>   In the new divided L.A., a leader can only succeed by having the
intangible attributes of being both a symbol and a communicator. All
that, plus the ability to connect with homeowner groups and other
neighborhood and grass-roots organizations--small but critical links
that hold L.A. together.</TE>
<TE>   We want our leaders from the streets and neighborhoods, not from
City Hall. Compare Parks with one of his most successful
predecessors, Ed Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Parks is all City Hall, a top-down manager who lectures rather
than listens. He expresses himself in the heavy language of the City
Hall bureaucrat, even when he talks to neighborhood groups. From the
beginning of his tenure, he scorned community policing, a popular
program that made residents feel as though they had their own
small-town police department. His words and actions against community
policing made him a symbol of a city government that didn't care.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, on the other hand, was all street, with a brilliant sense
of communication, symbolism and politics. He cultivated his
reputation as a rough law-and-order cop. His fierce and colorful
attacks on politicians and The Times--among cops' least-favorite
institutions--was seen by the police as a symbol of stubborn LAPD
independence.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Davis who created community policing, and he cemented
his ties with neighborhoods even more by organizing police-support
block clubs in every part of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn actually is from the neighborhoods, living in a middle-class
area of San Pedro. But like Parks, he has overdosed on the set ways
of City Hall, talking as though he were a bland department head in
fear of being overruled by the boss. After he moved against Parks,
Hahn exhibited a defensiveness reminiscent of a middle-level
executive worried about getting a poor performance report.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn doesn't seem to realize that he is the boss, with the power
to be more of a boss than any previous mayor. That's because the new
City Charter gives him unprecedented power.</TE>
<TE>   His immediate predecessors--Richard Riordan, Bradley and Sam
Yorty--had less legal power, but much more actual clout because they
understood what it takes to lead L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan defined his mayoralty by a single act of governance and
symbolism--driving to the city's emergency headquarters on the
morning of the 1994 Northridge earthquake, and taking charge. He
communicated to the city that he was the boss, no matter what the
charter said about his power. The image of boss was reinforced by his
campaigns for a new charter and for a new school board.</TE>
<TE>   Yorty was the first of L.A.'s modern media politicians. He was
elected mayor despite the opposition of the great media powers of the
time, the city's newspapers. He brushed aside the newspapers and went
on television, both with advertising and news shows--in the days when
TV actually covered politics.</TE>
<TE>   Yorty became the symbol of the scrappy little guy--especially the
Valley guy--against City Hall, although he occupied the place for
three terms. In a simpler city, he was able to hold the loyalty of a
constituency that was predominantly white and largely centered in the
San Fernando Valley. He withstood the 1965 Watts riots, fueled by
years of anger against the Police Department, and emerged strong
enough to beat Bradley in 1969 by playing the race card long before
the tactic became popular.</TE>
<TE>   For the next four years, Bradley tirelessly worked the same
neighborhoods, building his strength in the West Side, the Valley,
the harbor area, South L.A. and the Eastside, campaigning among
whites, blacks, Latinos, and among every economic class. He was the
first politician to acknowledge the importance of the city's growing
Asian population.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley became the mayor of all the people, for most of his reign
a comforting symbol of unity, a feeling best expressed during the
1984 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony seems to understand the dynamics of leadership here. He can
be as hot-tempered as Davis, as vindictive as Yorty, as impetuous as
Riordan. But when he campaigned against anti-immigrant measures in
1994 on the California ballot, he was, like Bradley, a symbol of
inclusion.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Mahony fumbled his way in dealing with the church's
sexual-abuse scandal, refusing to reveal how many priests had been
dismissed for past offenses. But then he regained his footing.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony invited television and news-radio reporters to his new
cathedral for short one-on-one interviews, where he was pleasant, if
not forthcoming. In the days that followed, he used the media to
transform himself from suspected co-conspirator in a priestly
cover-up to dedicated reformer. That's how he appeared on the
"NewsHour with Jim Lehrer" last week talking about the American
cardinals meeting with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican.</TE>
<TE>   The tide of history has already claimed Parks. Hahn is struggling
offshore, hoping a lifeguard can reach him in time. Only Mahony is
still afloat. He alone of the three understands the politics and
currents of the new L.A.</TE>

<HD>Europe and Israel: Trust Is Eroding</HD>
<DH>Having betrayed its core values once with anti-Jewish
policies, Europe should avoid repeating the error.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABRAHAM COOPER and HAROLD BRACKMAN</AU>
<BD>Rabbi Abraham Cooper is associate dean of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center. Harold Brackman, a historian, is a consultant to
the center.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many Americans have expressed alarm lately about Arab invective
against our policy toward Israel. But criticism and threats from Arab
countries are nothing new. Far more disturbing are the ugly
anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic sentiments emanating in recent weeks
from the European capitals of our allies in the war on terror.
Despite President Bush's challenge that "you're either with us or
against us" in the war on terrorism, the Europeans are on the verge
of declaring their own war, not against Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda,
but against Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the state of
Israel.</LD>
<LD>   The Europeans are afraid of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. They are afraid of their own burgeoning,
internal Arab and Muslim minorities. They are consumed with envy of
Washington's overriding clout in foreign affairs, especially in the
Middle East. And now they are venting their frustrations by using the
European Union to target Israel. The United States will likely be a
far more important arbiter in the bloody dispute over the Holy Land,
but what Europeans do and say will have a profound impact.</LD>
<TE>   The ties between Israel and Europe are deep. Israel has
painstakingly cultivated its economic ties with Europe, particularly,
since the 1993 Oslo peace accords. Today, The EU countries are
Israel's most important trade partner, accounting for about 30% of
Israel's exports and 41% of its imports in 2001. And so far these
economic ties remain strong. The EU's 15 members recently rejected a
resolution passed by the European Parliament recommending stripping
Israel of preferential trade status.</TE>
<TE>   But in the realm of global politics, there is less cause for
optimism. Throughout Europe, Israel is being politically spurned--in
the media, in institutions of higher learning and in the streets. And
the resulting erosion of mutual trust is alarming.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most disturbing, though, is the nature of the anti-Israel
sentiment so pervasive across Europe at the moment: It reveals both
bad judgment and bad faith. Some examples:</TE>
<TE>   In Britain, where the country's chief rabbi recently asserted that
"British Jewry is suffering the worst anti-Semitism since the
Holocaust," anti-Israel sentiments run strong. London's Harrods
department store temporarily removed some Israeli products from its
shelves. British poet and Oxford lecturer Tom Paulin, said that
American-born Jewish settlers in Israel should be shot. A London
Arabic newspaper printed a poem in praise of Palestinian suicide
bombers by Saudi Ambassador Ghazi Algosaibi. Police across England
logged 15 major anti-Semitic incidents during April, including
physical assaults, vandalism, graffiti and hate mail. Perhaps more
disturbing, though, has been the muted reaction from other religious
leaders, some of whom, denying that the Jewish people have a valid
historic link to the Holy Land, have scorned efforts by the
archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, to promote and encourage
Jewish-Palestinian reconciliation.</TE>
<TE>   In Amsterdam, an anti-Israel crowd carrying more pictures of Adolf
Hitler and swastikas than the Dutch have seen since the Nazi
occupation, marched under Stars of David superimposed on swastikas
while chanting "Sieg Heil," "Jews into the sea" and "Al Yahud Kalb"
("Jews are dogs," in Arabic). Meanwhile, as many rushed to accuse
Israel of mass murder in the suicide bomb-making mecca of Jenin, the
Dutch government itself had to resign after intelligence documents
confirmed that a Dutch United Nations peace-keeping battalion in
Srebrenica unwittingly helped separate Muslim men and boys from their
families before the massacre of more than 7,000 of them by Bosnian
Serb forces in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   In Paris, five EU governments condemned the wave of synagogue
bombings across Europe as "racist and xenophobic violence
constitut[ing] a total violation of the principles of liberty,
democracy and human rights." But at almost the same moment, the
French government joined Belgium Sweden, Austria, Spain and Portugal
in voting for a U.N. Human Rights Commission resolution condoning
violent Palestinian "self-defense" while failing to denounce suicide
attacks on Israeli civilians.</TE>
<TE>   In Brussels, the EU capital, diamond merchants informed Israeli
businessmen that the Belgian government is considering a commercial
boycott of Israel. Meanwhile, the humanitarian organization Oxfam
lobbied Belgium's largest supermarket chain to ban Israeli products.
This outburst of anti-Israel moral indignation coincided with a
daytime beating of Brussels' chief rabbi and a warning to Jews not to
wear traditional religious garb in public.</TE>
<TE>   In Berlin, the government announced a temporary embargo on some
military sales to Israel. At around the same time, Jews were warned
not to wear religious garments that could expose them to attacks, and
vandals in the western German town of Herford painted the local
synagogue with the words: "Six million were not enough."</TE>
<TE>   In Copenhagen, the National Union of General Workers, a part of
the government, decided to go ahead with an economic boycott of
Israel. At the same time, the Islamic extremist Hizb-ut-Tahrir party
distributed leaflets in the Danish capital's Israel Square urging
people to "kill the Jews."</TE>
<TE>   In Oslo, the supermarket chain Coop Norge made an unsuccessful
attempt to organize a Scandinavian-wide boycott of Israel products.
The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions called on the government
to boycott Israel, and an anti-Israel member of the Norwegian
Parliament said he regretted that Shimon Peres--but not Yasser
Arafat--would retain his 1994 Nobel Peace Prize.</TE>
<TE>   At Kiev's main synagogue, a skinhead mob beat up Rabbi Moshe Azman
and worshippers and smashed windows. After a second attack on Jews,
this time in southern Ukraine, government officials condemned the
violence, but they insisted it was merely an outburst by young soccer
hooligans unrelated to anti-Semitism or the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   While there are individual voices of support for Israel in
Europe--in Rome, for example, journalist Oriana Fallaci denounced
state-run television stations for their indifference to Israeli
deaths while "they host with much deference the scoundrels with
turban or kaffiyeh who yesterday sang hymns to the slaughter at New
York and today sing hymns to the slaughters at Jerusalem, at Haifa,
at Netanya, at Tel Aviv"--there is real cause for concern.</TE>
<TE>   A half a century ago, European appeasers tried to pacify Hitler at
the expense of Europe's Jewish minority. Jews were the catastrophic
losers, but Europe also lost. It has never recovered its global
preeminence--nor its moral standing.</TE>
<TE>   The current temptation for Europe to advance its political and
economic position in the world by selling out Israel to the Arabs
also has roots in the Holocaust era, when Nazis courted Arab fascists
during World War II. Having betrayed its core values once in a doomed
attempt to reap international benefits from anti-Jewish policies,
Europe will accomplish nothing from repeating the error--except to
further embolden terrorism on its territory and accelerate the
resurrection of the continent's long dormant fascist ghosts.</TE>

<HD>The Triumph of Extremes</HD>
<DH>Legislature could be a nightmare for new governor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHERRY BEBITCH JEFFE</AU>
<BD>Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a contributing editor to Opinion,
is a senior scholar in the School of Policy, Planning and Development
at USC. She is also a political analyst for KCAL-TV.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last month's primaries eroded California's legislative center, but
the governor we elect in November will likely pay the price.</LD>
<LD>   Should GOP challenger Bill Simon pull another stunning upset and
defeat Gov. Gray Davis, he will face a conservative Republican
governor's worst nightmare: a Legislature in which Democrats hold
lop-sided majorities in both houses and in which those majorities are
weighted heavily toward liberals. If Davis wins reelection, he will
face a centrist governor's worst nightmare: a Legislature in which
Democrats hold lop-sided majorities in both houses and in which those
majorities are weighted heavily toward liberals.</LD>
<LD>   There are still six months of campaigning before the general
election ratifies the Legislature's make-up, but we already know the
Republican legislative caucus will be more conservative and the
Democratic caucus more liberal. Sacramento's moderate middle has
taken it on the chin.</LD>
<TE>   The polarization of the Legislature began with the reapportionment
deal that Republican lawmakers cut with the Democrats, who control
the political map-making. It preserved the "status quo" and ensured
mostly "safe" seats for both parties. In exchange for their support,
GOP legislators staunched further attrition of their already anemic
numbers. The deal also headed off potential Democratic House gains
that could tip the balance of power in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Then the ideological dogfight in the party's gubernatorial primary
and March's historically low voter turnout boosted die-hard
conservatives over more moderate candidates running in Republican
primaries for the newly carved seats.</TE>
<TE>   Four GOP lawmakers--Mike Briggs of Fresno, Dick Dickerson of
Redding, Anthony Pescetti of Rancho Cordova and David Kelley of
Idyllwild--voted for the current state budget. In last month's
primaries, two of them lost their bids for higher office. Pescetti
and Kelley chose not to run for reelection. You can bet that the
Republicans who will likely replace these four in the lower house--or
any GOP lawmaker, for that matter--will think long and hard before
making a budget deal with Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the New Majority political action committee,
described by the California Target Book as "wealthy Orange County
donors favoring moderate GOP candidates," lost big. Six of the nine
contenders supported by the PAC were defeated, among them budget
"turncoat" Dickerson. Dickerson lost the state Senate nomination to
Assemblyman Sam Aanestad of Grass Valley, considered a more
"reliable" conservative, in a safe Republican district. Another
PAC-supported moderate, Assemblywoman Charlene Zettel of Poway, lost
the state Senate nomination to Assemblyman Dennis Hollingsworth, who
had the backing of party conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   With no fight for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, the
ideological war intensified in legislative primaries, which pitted
two intraparty factions against each other. The "mod squad" is a
group of centrist, pro-business Assembly Democrats who tend to side
with corporate and agricultural interests in their battles with
unions, consumer and environmental groups. The "mods" have wielded
real clout in Sacramento, sometimes providing Davis with back-up for
his own business-friendly proposals.</TE>
<TE>   The new "progressive coalition" is an alliance of liberal
Democrats concentrated mostly in the state Senate and traditional
Democratic constituencies and contributors--labor unions, teachers,
trial lawyers, environmentalists and consumer groups.</TE>
<TE>   The internecine fragging was ferocious, because the philosophical
bent of the Legislature was at stake. With Democratic majorities
likely entrenched for at least the next decade, "the conflict," as
one activist put it, "has changed from partisanship to ideology."</TE>
<TE>   In the low-turnout Democratic primary, liberals dominated the
electorate, and moderates got their clocks cleaned.</TE>
<TE>   Business interests lined up behind centrist Democrats. Trial
lawyers and unions put their clout behind more liberal candidates.
The Political Pulse newsletter reported, "Democratic candidates
backed by trial-lawyer groups went three for four in defeating
candidates backed by business interests in seats where they
competed."</TE>
<TE>   In the L.A. area, according to a union release, labor backed six
Assembly "candidates with strong pro-worker credentials" running
"against well-funded, big-business-backed candidates." L.A. unions
counted six primary victories in safe Democratic seats.</TE>
<TE>   Former Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, a termed-out leader of the
"mods," saw his handpicked candidate, centrist Andrei Cherny, lose
the primary to replace him in a heavily Democratic district. Two
pro-business committees, JOBS PAC and Californians for Common Sense,
reportedly spent at least $150,000 supporting Cherny against Assembly
staffer Lloyd Levine. But according to California Journal, Cherny's
pro-voucher, pro-tort reform views "brought labor, teachers, and
trial lawyers steaming into the Levine camp."</TE>
<TE>   The wrangle over the ballooning budget deficit offers a preview of
the ideological roadblocks either Davis or Simon will face as
governor. Simon's proposal of a 15% across-the-board budget cut is
totally out of sync with Democratic priorities; it will go nowhere in
the liberal-dominated Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has his own problems. This year, GOP legislators, with
little risk of a voter backlash, could decide to embarrass the
governor and deny Democrats the two-thirds vote necessary to pass the
budget, perhaps until well into the fall. Then there's Davis' prickly
relationship with legislators of his own party; the state's most
powerful lawmaker, state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton,
personifies it.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has pledged to balance the budget without raising taxes. But
to ease the cash crunch, he has to find a way to cut billions in
appropriations without angering fellow Democrats and traditional
party constituencies with significant stakes in government programs.
Burton, who leads the liberal opposition to quite a few of the
governor's proposals, doesn't see balancing the budget without a
multibillion-dollar tax increase.</TE>
<TE>   The dearth of affection between Davis and Burton is legendary.
Their agendas don't mesh; neither do their personalities. The liberal
senator exudes impatience with the governor's cautious centrism, and
Davis appears flummoxed by Burton's flamboyant frankness.</TE>
<TE>   David Doak, Davis' media advisor, obliquely nailed the problem
when he addressed Simon's reticence to grapple with the press corps.
If Simon, Doak asked a reporter, "can't handle questions from
reporters, how will he handle questions from John Burton?" Burton and
Sacramento's re-energized liberal majority have little to lose
opposing either Davis or Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Such legislative independence could be hell for the next governor.</TE>

<KH>THE 1992 RIOTS</KH>
<HD>Reports of L.A.'s Demise Greatly Exaggerated</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOEL KOTKIN</AU>
<BD>Joel Kotkin, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a
senior fellow at the Davenport Institute for Public Policy at
Pepperdine and at the Milken Institute.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A decade ago, it was Los Angeles noir, all the time. As the city
reeled from rioting, most media, business and academic leaders, from
far right to far left, seemed united in the belief that Los Angeles
epitomized what was bad about U.S. cities. Typical were the
pronouncements of Time magazine, which spoke somberly of a "malaise"
that hung over the city like a "Stage II smog layer." A year after
the riots, the magazine asserted that "L.A.'s days of anxiety will
continue. The city will suffer its uneasy dreams of fire so long as
nearly every aspect of local life --schools, police, municipal
government, race relations, the economy--provides tinder." To the
folks at New York's Rockefeller Center, it was a wonder how Angelenos
could "imagine how [their city] might survive."</LD>
<LD>   Well, it's not a stretch to say that Los Angeles, overall, is a
better place today than it was a decade ago. Crime rates, although up
slightly over the past year, are half what they were 10 years ago,
both citywide and in the riot zone. The city's economy is more
diversified. Political power has been extended to a long-marginalized
population. New infrastructure--from the subway to Staples Center,
Walt Disney Concert Hall to the Alameda Corridor rail project--shows
that Southern California retains the will to create a great city.</LD>
<TE>   Why were the "experts'" doom-and-gloom predictions about L.A. so
wrong? In part, it was because their presumptions about the city were
always too facile and almost absurdly overblown. Consider them.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is an evil and unjust city. Whether to critics on the
right or left, Los Angeles was not just a troubled city--it was the
epitome of evil. Oddly, much of this analysis was home-grown.</TE>
<TE>   To L.A. leftist author Mike Davis, the rioters possessed a
"visible moral economy" that offered them "a last call to participate
in the general redistribution of wealth in progress." Such
radical-chic views were embraced by many at local universities and in
some media circles here, then accepted, virtually wholesale, by the
outside world. USC geographer Michael Dear and his wife, Jennifer
Wolch, painted Los Angeles in terms that would make Raymond Chandler
blanch. The "accurate" view of Los Angeles was not that of an
emerging "world crossroad city" but of "a superficial gloss of
striking beauty, glowing light and pastel hues, which together
conspire to conceal a hideous culture of malice, mistrust and
mutiny."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' and Dear's commentaries on L.A. remain part of the
mainstream academic view of the city. Dear heads a well-funded and
widely quoted USC-based think tank on Southern California, while
Davis and other ideologues of deconstructed Los Angeles, despite
their wildly inaccurate predictions of L.A.'s future, continue to be
leading interpreters of the city, especially in the eyes of the
eastern media. Even today, UCLA's Ralph and Goldy Lewis Center for
Regional Policy Studies will "celebrate" the 10th anniversary of what
it reverently refers to as "the uprising."</TE>
<TE>   Without question, the generally negative attitudes have changed to
something more nuanced and less hysterical. Old-time boosterism is
rare, to be sure, but such organizations as the Economic Development
Corp and the L.A. Chamber of Commerce, which seemed confused or even
downright negative about the region's prospects, have become more
assertive in promoting the area's assets.</TE>
<TE>   Recent work by both USC and the Economic Roundtable, once the most
pessimistic of analysts, is similarly more balanced. The Roundtable's
report "South L.A. Rising" identifies continuing weaknesses in the
riot's epicenter but sees reason for hope, too, because many
structures have been rebuilt and grass-roots development efforts are
growing. It calls the area "the seedbed for an economic renaissance."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the most recent explosions of civic angst have taken
place in seemingly placid cities like Cincinnati and, astoundingly,
in Seattle, which, a decade ago, was the preferred destination of
those who wanted out of Los Angeles. Seattle has been plagued by
riots at the World Trade Organization conference, the departure of
its leading corporate citizen, Boeing, and, just last week, a
disturbance sparked by the police shooting of a black motorist.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' economy could never recovery without major federal
assistance. The Los Angeles of 10 years ago was thought to be
addicted to U.S. Defense Department steroids, so when the Cold War
ended and military spending dramatically fell off, many expected the
end of "our golden way of life," to quote one Times columnist. Many
members of the city's business leadership shared this view. Some,
like the chairman of the California Chamber of Commerce, pulled out
of Southern California and moved his operations to Utah--all under
the hot lights of CNN and the rest of the national media. California,
and particularly Los Angeles, were experiencing what Fortune magazine
called "the goodbye wave."</TE>
<TE>   With the city's corporate leadership largely paralyzed by
self-doubt and delusions of "greener pastures" elsewhere, the early
1990s became the era of "defense conversion," which held that Los
Angeles' only hope of economic recovery lay in a federally funded
program to transform bomb and missile makers into producers of
mass-transit trains.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most telling of the time's general gloom was an analysis
done by the county-financed L.A. aerospace task force. In 1992, the
task force predicted that Los Angeles would still be down 185,000
jobs by the end of 2002. The Southern California Assn. of
Governments, meanwhile, predicted unemployment in the region would
remain near double-digit levels well into the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   Help from Washington never came, but, somehow, Los Angeles,
despite a Pharaonic wave of earthquakes, fires and floods, staged a
major recovery by the mid-1990s, driven largely by the expansion of
trade, entertainment and an array of new technology businesses.
Unemployment dropped dramatically, and housing prices began their
long, and still continuing, upswing. The recovery was not evenly
distributed. As in the wake of the Watts unrest in 1965, businesses
tended to move away from the city's center toward the periphery after
the 1992 riots, notably to the Westside and the San Fernando Valley,
as well as farther-out suburbs. Yet, in contrast with other post-riot
situations in major cities, the central core of L.A. did not die. In
Detroit, Washington and other cities, damage caused by riots three
decades ago is often still evident; in L.A. at least 80% of the
destroyed sites have been rebuilt.</TE>
<TE>   Employment in South Los Angeles, which was plummeting before the
riots, has recovered and, despite the recession, is near 1992 levels.
Home prices have spurted up from their mid-'90s lows. Equally
important, by the beginning of the new millennium, other neglected
sections of the city--Hollywood, Echo Park, mid-Wilshire and
downtown--were showing unmistakable, if sometimes uneven, renewed
economic vigor. Even the long-dismissive New York Times effusively
noted that Los Angeles, a city of sprawl, was suddenly "transforming
itself in ways that defy its stereotype" as a vibrant urban place.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, the structure and social character of the L.A.
economy has changed, mostly for the better, in the last 10 years.
Instead of relying on a handful of major corporations, the city's
economy now rests largely on small and medium-sized businesses, a
large portion of which are minority- or immigrant-owned. These
companies form a diverse economy that has withstood the current
recession better than many long-time L.A. competitors, including such
media darlings as New York, San Francisco and Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is a seething cauldron of racial conflict. Even after
the fires died out and reconstruction replaced rioting as the main
activity in most of the city's minority areas, the academic and media
establishment continued to predict a hellish racial future for the
city. The new focus of racial conflict was immigrants. L.A.'s
Latinos, in the famous phrase of UCLA geographer Roger Waldinger,
constituted "a quiescent mass that's ready to explode."</TE>
<TE>   But Latinos and other parts of the city's ethnic mosaic have not
performed according to script. Rather than "explode," Latinos have
become integral to the city's economic, political and cultural life.
Seven of the 10 top surnames of homebuyers in L.A. County are Latino.
In surveys, these new citizens repeatedly poll as the most optimistic
of all Angelenos.</TE>
<TE>   Latinos, Asians and other immigrants, particularly those from the
Middle East, increasingly drive many of L.A.'s industries.
Asian-owned banks predominate among the top L.A.-based financial
institutions. Newcomers from Korea, Iraq, Israel and North Africa
largely control the county's $22-billion fashion industry, which has
grown into the nation's largest. Over the past year, the chairmen of
United Way and its L.A. chapters were both Chinese immigrants, an
indication of how civic leadership has diversified.</TE>
<TE>   Visit the pulse centers of the L.A. economy--from the produce and
jewelry districts downtown to the media centers of Burbank, the
Valley and West L.A.--and a whole new generation of entrepreneurs and
creators are rising from the city's ethnic and racial diversity. In a
generation, the city's economy has gone from white to multiethnic to
what may be called post-ethnic.</TE>
<TE>   Even in city politics, long marred by racial pandering, there are
promising signs. Last year's mayoral race was marked by a Latino
candidate who preached inclusiveness. In contrast, mayoral races in
Philadelphia and New York were heavily racialized. Latinos have made
enormous political strides, winning the City Council presidency as
well the as the city attorney's office. Much of L.A. county's state
and federal legislative leadership is Hispanic. Within a decade,
Latinos have moved from the political margins to the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   Even the one significant race-oriented conflict in L.A., the
controversy over the reappointment of Police Chief Bernard C. Parks,
shows how far we've progressed. Ten years ago, the police chief was
widely hated in the African American community; today, the black
community led the fight to retain the chief, who, although black, is
also an unbending law-and-order figure. In character, the ramrod
stiff Parks could not be more different as a rallying point than the
perennially troubled Rodney G. King, whose beating by LAPD officers
set off the series of events leading to the riots.</TE>
<TE>   None of this suggests that Los Angeles has become paradise on
Earth. Inefficient government downtown and an often unmanageable
geographic spread have nurtured secessionist movements. Education,
housing and transportation still require attention. Yet, 10 years
after an event that would have crippled most cities, the City of
Angels has risen again, not perhaps to its full potential, but enough
to look toward the future with something other than dread.</TE>

<HD>Israel's Jewish Critics Aren't 'Self-Hating'</HD>
<DH>There is no path to Jewish security that does not also lead
us to global security for all peoples.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LERNER</AU>
<BD>Rabbi Michael Lerner is editor of Tikkun and, with
Cornel West and Susannah Heschel, co-chair of The Tikkun Community.
He is author of "Spirit Matters." He is participating in a teach-in
today, April 28, on these issues at 1:30 p.m. at the University
Synagogue at 11960 Sunset Blvd. in West Los Angeles. E-mail:

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Every day, I receive anguished letters, e-mails and phone calls from
members of my congregation and others who have been tagged with the
label "self-hating Jews." Why? Solely because they've raised
questions about Israel's policy toward Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   There is something deeply hurtful about that term and about the
way the Jewish community is treating its dissenters, something
reminiscent of the cultural repressiveness of 1950s McCarthyism and
its labeling of dissidents as "anti-American." Jews in America are
all Jews by choice. Those who wish to leave their religion and
ethnicity behind can easily do so. Increasing numbers, when asked
about their ethnicity or religion, answer, "my parents are Jewish,"
indicating that they no longer feel connected to that identity.</LD>
<TE>   But most Jews don't make that choice. They feel a special
resonance with the history and culture of a people that has
proclaimed a message of love, justice and peace while others pursued
paths of cruelty and domination. They feel a special pride in being
part of a people that has insisted on the possibility of "tikkun," a
Hebrew word expressing a belief that the world can be fundamentally
healed and transformed. They know that the Jews have paid dearly for
that belief, and, though they are angry at the history of
anti-Semitism and convinced that no one should ever have to endure
again what we endured from Christian Europe, they are also proud that
Jewish values kept us from becoming like our oppressors.</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles Times poll in 1988 found that some 50% of Jews
surveyed identified "a commitment to social equality" as the
characteristic most important to their Jewish identity. Only 17%
cited a commitment to Israel. Similar statistics have been reported
many times in the subsequent 14 years by other pollsters. No wonder,
then, that these social-justice oriented American Jews should feel
betrayed by Israeli policies that seem transparently immoral and
self-destructive.</TE>
<TE>   All of us are outraged at the immoral acts of Palestinian
terrorists who blow up Israelis as they sit at a Seder table, or shop
in their stores, or sit in cafes or ride in buses. We know that these
acts cannot be forgiven, no matter how they have been provoked.</TE>
<TE>   But many of us also understand that Israeli treatment of
Palestinians has been immoral and outrageous. Hundreds of thousands
of Palestinians fled their homes in 1948, and recent Israeli
historical research has shown that most of them fled not because they
were responding to the appeal of Arab leaders, but because they were
terrified at the acts of violence by right-wing Israeli terrorists or
because they were actually physically forced from their homes by the
Israeli army. (The slaying of some 250 Palestinian civilians in a
town that had indicated loyalty to Israel, Deir Yassin, was
intentionally aimed at convincing Palestinians that they would not be
safe in a new Israeli state, no matter how much they wished to live
in peace.) Palestinian refugees and their families now number
more than 3 million, and many live in horrifying conditions in refugee
camps under Israeli military rule.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Israel's promises in 1993 at Oslo to end its occupation of
the Palestinian territories by May 4, 1999, the actual path Israel
took was the opposite. After a right-wing Israeli murdered
peace-oriented Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Israel actually
increased the number of West Bank settlers, from around 120,000 in
1993 to some 200,000 by the time Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
met with Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat at Camp David.
And though the Israeli and U.S. media bought the myth that what had
been offered to Palestinians was "the best they could expect," and
that hence their rejection of the offer was proof that they wanted
nothing less than the full destruction of Israel, the actual details
show a quite different story. Not only did Barak offer Arafat less
than had been promised in 1993, but he refused to provide anything at
all in the way of reparations or compensation for the refugees.
Instead, he insisted that Arafat sign a statement saying that the
terms being offered by Barak would end all claims by the Palestinian
people against Israel and would represent a resolution of all
outstanding issues. No Palestinian leader could have signed that
agreement and abandoned the needs of those refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Though it is popularly thought that negotiations ended there, in
fact they continued at Taba until Ariel Sharon's election ended the
process, one which, according to the then-Minister of Justice Yossi
Beilin (writing recently in the New York Times), was very close to
arriving at a full agreement between the two peoples.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon did not want that agreement, because he had always opposed
any deal that would involve abandoning the West Bank settlements,
which he had helped establish in the 1980s--precisely to ensure that
Israel would never abandon the occupied territories. Using the excuse
of responding to the (totally immoral and unacceptable) acts of
terror by some Palestinians, Sharon has recently set out to destroy
the institutions of Palestinian society, and they have done so
brutally, with great harm to many civilians.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder, then, that many Jews would feel deeply upset by Israeli
policies. On the one hand, they can see that the policies are leading
to a frightening upsurge of anti-Semitism. On the other hand, they
can see that the policies are not providing security for Israel, but
instead creating new generations of future terrorists and convincing
the world that Israel has lost its moral compass.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many Jews and non-Jews have been intimidated by the intense
campaign being waged on behalf of Israeli "political correctness."
Organized by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and
by other Jewish institutions, they label those critical of Israel
"self-hating" if they are Jewish or anti-Semitic if not. They
mobilize large amounts of money to defeat candidates deemed
insufficiently pro-Israel. Many rabbis and professionals have told me
recently that they fear for their jobs should they even begin to
articulate their doubts about Israeli policy--much less give explicit
support to calls for an end to the occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, far from being self-hating, Jews are affirming the highest
values of their culture and religion when they conclude that being
pro-Israel today requires pushing Israel to end the occupation and
break the cycle of violence on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Many American Jews understand the need in today's world to abandon
chauvinism and insistence on Jewish "specialness." We need instead to
affirm those parts of Jewish tradition that lead us to be able to
recognize the spirit of God in every human being on the planet, and
to recognize that our security will come not from more armaments for
Israel, but from more love and connection between the Jewish people
and all other peoples. There is no special path to Jewish safety and
security that does not also lead us to global safety and security for
all peoples.</TE>
<TE>   I have great compassion for Jews who can't imagine a world in
which other people can be trusted. The horrors of the Holocaust
continue to reverberate. But if we allow that fear to shape our
current perceptions of possibility, we will self-fulfillingly
recreate the very world of antagonism toward Jews that we feared--and
that would give Adolf Hitler a posthumous victory. The best response
to the hatred of the past is to pursue a path that affirms love,
justice and peace, and rejects the "realists" who insist that our
only security lies in military domination over the Palestinian
people.</TE>
<TE>   It is time for the U.S. to sponsor a multinational force to
physically separate and protect Israel and Palestine from each other,
and to then convene an international conference to impose a final
settlement. The settlement would include an end to the occupation,
evacuation of the settlements, reparations for Palestinian refugees
(and also for Jews who fled Arab lands), recognition of Israel by
surrounding Arab states and an end to all acts of terror and
violence. This is the goal of thousands of American Jews and our
non-Jewish allies--who have recently formed the Tikkun Community--a
progressive pro-Israel organization. Unwilling to be considered
traitors and no longer sure that Jewishness is worth preserving if it
means the Jewishness of Sharon, we have joined together because we
are not willing to allow our culture and religion to lose its
prophetic message of generosity, compassion and open-heartedness.
("Thou shalt love the stranger.") No surprise that we have been
greeted by some Jews with their favorite mantra: You are self-hating
Jews.</TE>

<HD>A Leap of Faith</HD>
<DH>American Catholics, more than they realize, are in a
position to decide what kind of church they want.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK MILES</AU>
<BD>Jack Miles, senior advisor to the president of the J.
Paul Getty Trust, is the author of "God: A Biography," and "Christ: A
Crisis in the Life of God."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I am a born Roman Catholic who became an Episcopalian more than 20
years ago. I made the change in all sincerity, and yet in my heart I
regard myself as a member of both churches at once, or, better, as
"proleptically" (by anticipation) the loyal member of a Christian
church that does not yet exist.</LD>
<LD>   In 1982, on the 20th anniversary of the opening of the Second
Vatican Council, I was one of a number of writers whom Commonweal
asked to say how the council had changed them. My short answer was
that it had made me a Protestant, but that answer concealed as much
as it revealed. I return to that moment now because, as I have
learned from an article by Peter Steinfels in the current Commonweal
magazine, a good few American Catholics find themselves at a similar
turning point today.</LD>
<LD>   Steinfels writes: "Seasoned observers of Catholicism are
straining--and failing--to find a comparable event against which to
measure the current crisis. Polls of Catholics register their massive
loss of confidence in their leaders. Interviews surface raw anger.
Catholics report friends and family members who have started
attending other churches."</LD>
<TE>   I do not propose that all of those troubled Catholics should leap
to become Episcopalians. Most will and should remain Catholics, but
the church, like the Sabbath, was made for man, not man for the
church (Mark 1:27). Just what kind of church American Catholics will
have is, more than they may realize, up to them to decide.</TE>
<TE>   Most Americans have forgotten, but older Catholics remember well
the Catholic sex crisis of 1968. In October of 1962, when Pope John
XXIII convened the Second Vatican Council, millions of Catholics
hoped for a change in the teaching that holds abortion as a crime
equivalent to murder and artificial birth control a crime equivalent
to abortion. According to the latter half of this teaching, a woman
who has sex while using a diaphragm or a man who does so with a
condom commits a sin as grievous as murder.</TE>
<TE>   Would John XXIII allow the council to revise this teaching? Many
hoped so, but "the good pope" died midway through the three-year
council, and his successor forbade the assembled prelates to even
debate the issue. Instead, Paul VI created a commission of lay as
well as clerical experts to advise him on whether a change should be
made. The council ended in 1965. The birth-control commission did
much of its work in 1967. Its advice to Paul VI--leaked to the press
in an electric moment--was that artificial birth control should
indeed be allowed.</TE>
<TE>   Now came the crisis. Could Paul VI rise to the occasion? Could he,
by admitting error and correcting his predecessors, redeem and
validate papal authority itself? Alas, the pope instead overrode the
recommendation of his commission and issued in 1968 an encyclical
titled "Humanae Vitae" reaffirming the traditional teaching without
qualification. Faced with the choice between clerical solidarity and
the needs of the faithful, a cautious man chose clerical solidarity.
The irony, of course, was that his action undermined the very
authority he invoked to take it.</TE>
<TE>   It did so because, within a few years, the vast majority of
Catholics, worldwide, were ignoring the papal ban on artificial
contraception. Their priests and bishops knew this perfectly well;
but the more the mistaken morality was abandoned in the bedroom, the
more loudly it had to be proclaimed from the Throne of St. Peter. For
John Paul II, loyalty to "Humanae Vitae" has reportedly been a litmus
test eclipsing other, absolutely crucial considerations. John L.
Allen Jr., Vatican correspondent for The National Catholic Reporter,
wrote recently in the New York Times: "Every pope seeks bishops who
will defend the church's teachings. But some, like Paul VI, sought
other attributes as well: good pastoral sense, lively engagement with
the culture and support from the local church. For John Paul II,
however, it is often enough that a candidate supports Humanae Vitae
... and opposes the ordination of women."</TE>
<TE>   Rigor in policing the clerical ranks for signs of child abuse has
all too evidently not been high on the current pope's list of
desirable attributes. It is in this way that the contraception
debacle and ensuing anxiety about the state of papal authority may be
said to have contributed to the pedophilia debacle. Boston's tainted
Cardinal Bernard Law--a "Humanae Vitae" loyalist--was, until the
scandal, a Vatican favorite.</TE>
<TE>   For me, in the post-"Humanae Vitae" Catholic debate, the decisive
intellectual intervention was that of British theologian Charles
Davis. What was there in the patrimony of Christianity, Davis asked,
other than papal authority that a Roman Catholic like himself could
not find in some other Christian communion? Would it be the
Eucharistic liturgy? The other sacraments? Devotion to Mary?
Franciscan spirituality? Davis implicitly invited his hearers to
lengthen the list, but his own conclusion was clear: Everything that
mattered was indeed available elsewhere; it was papal authority alone
that was only available in Rome. But was it not papal authority that
Humanae Vitae had now discredited? Why, then, remain a Catholic? And
thereupon Davis left the church.</TE>
<TE>   It took me a few years, but I followed him. Then, as now, the
issue was not sexuality per se but authority and how it is exercised.
I hasten to add that when it comes to authority, the origins of the
Episcopal church are downright repellent. King Henry VIII did not
break with Rome on any matter of principle. The royal roue simply
wanted to play pope in his own kingdom, adding papal lands to his own
and granting himself his own many divorces on his own authority. But
when the newborn United States threw off the authority of the king of
England, the Church of England in the United States did the same. The
Episcopal church, born at that moment, became a democracy, electing
its local bishops, and electing a national "presiding bishop" who,
like the president of the country, serves for a specified term. It
was this, finally, more than the deep kinship in doctrine and ritual
between the Anglican and the Roman traditions that made a convert of
me.</TE>
<TE>   But it made me, as I continue to insist, a proleptic or
anticipatory convert, for the kind of change that American Anglicans
made 200 years ago American Catholics could make today if they so
chose. And if they did, the Episcopalians and they (and perhaps a
good many other American Christians) would wake up to find themselves
seated together in a greater church. Moreover, since no national
church within the Catholic communion is more powerful than the
American, a change here would change the Catholic church as a whole.
In retrospect, American Catholics could be seen to have used American
democratic institutions--the courts and the free press--to deliver
the church not just from a passing sexual scandal but from an abiding
institutional handicap.</TE>
<TE>   According to former Russian leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the great
lesson of the 20th century is that enormous changes can come with
enormous suddenness. There is nothing inherently un-Catholic about
democracy. When a pope dies, his successor is not appointed but
elected. That principle could be extended from within, and democracy
could, in time, make the successor of Peter as good at admitting sin
and error as Peter himself was. In Acts 10:26, the first pope,
embarrassed when a new convert kneels before him, says "Stand up. I
too am a man."</TE>
<TE>   "Stand up. I too am a man" might be the motto of a new Catholic
democracy. Peter spoke those words at a moment when he had just
recognized and publicly admitted the confusion of his earlier
thinking on a matter of decisive importance to the church. History
will note that not only did the church survive his admission of
error, so did his own reputation for wisdom, humility and sanctity.</TE>

<HD>Bush Scraps China Policy of Six Presidents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAY TAYLOR</AU>
<BD>Jay Taylor was State Department director of analysis
for East Asia and the Pacific and deputy assistant secretary for
intelligence and research in the Reagan administration.</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Va.</DL>
<LD>Last year, with U.S. attention riveted on the Middle East and
terrorism, the Bush administration quietly revised the "one China"
policy of six previous presidents. Seeing China as our potential No.1
enemy, the Pentagon prepared the way for the United States to kill
millions of Chinese, if necessary, to protect the separate status of
Taiwan. Beijing is angry. But only a few months after this policy
change was highlighted in the leaked Nuclear Posture Review, the
administration is hosting Vice President Hu Jintao, the likely next
president of China, this week in Washington. In either capital, does
the left hand know what the right is doing?</LD>
<LD>   Over the past year, one-China traditionalists in the
administration successfully moved U.S.-China relations ahead, not the
least because they were overwhelmingly supported by U.S. business and
by the president's father. Economic ties between China and the United
States continued to expand. The two countries closely cooperated on a
range of issues, from Korea to terrorism, and Washington handled
bilateral crises with patient diplomacy. As in the past, the U.S.
government preferred jawboning to sanctions in pressing China to
improve its human-rights record.</LD>
<TE>   For almost 30 years, creative ambiguity was at the heart of the
one-China policy: The United States warned China not to use force to
resolve the Taiwan issue but did not categorically pledge to defend
the island regardless of Taiwan's position on sovereignty. The U.S.
assured China that it would not support or recognize Taiwan's
independence but, at the same time, continued shipping advanced
weapons to the island for its self-defense. This balanced approach
provided a framework for U.S.-China detente, for Taiwan's remarkable
economic growth and democratization, and for the stunning expansion
of cross-strait business, social, and cultural relations. Coupled
with dramatic changes inside China, these developments also directly
contributed to the opening of China's closed society. From Richard M.
Nixon through Bill Clinton, U.S. administrations believed that the
one-China policy would lead eventually to a peaceful agreement
formalizing, in some loose manner, the unity of China and Taiwan, and
that this would be in the U.S. interest.</TE>
<TE>   But early on, the Bush administration made repeated categorical
pledges to do "whatever it takes" to protect the island. The
rationale behind this change was the belief among the Pentagon's top
civilians that Taiwan is a strategic platform that must be denied to
the emerging power of East Asia, the most dangerous potential rival
to U.S. global preeminence. The administration declared that it still
accepted the one- China principle, but it asserted as late as January
that Taipei was free to reject the principle, as it has done since
1999.</TE>
<TE>   While ending the ambiguity on Taiwan's defense, the administration
has muddied the waters on the previously clear U.S. opposition to the
island's independence. This switch was long advocated by leading
revisionists on China, such as Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D.
Wolfowitz and John Bolton, an undersecretary in the State Department.
Evidence of the change is not hard to find. For the first time since
1978, the State Department last year permitted Taiwan's president,
vice president and premier to hold separate meetings with U.S.
lawmakers on American soil. Most recently, the Taiwan defense
minister held a "non-official" meeting with Wolfowitz in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   China protested these departures from the one-China policy as
"hegemonic acts of gross interference." But Beijing has not
threatened a major breakdown in relations, much less heightened
tensions across the Taiwan Strait. China dearly wants to avoid any
such crisis. Its booming economy depends in large part on America's
continuing purchase of more than $80 billion in Chinese-made products
and huge capital investments in China. Beijing puts great stock in
hosting the 2008 Olympic Games, and nothing spoils an Olympics like a
war or even a whiff of its possibility. Furthermore, a new Chinese
leadership will be chosen in the fall, and the incumbent pragmatists,
led by President Jiang Zemin, and the incoming ones, led by Hu, do
not want a building sense of national grievance against the United
States to play into the hands of the more conservative faction, which
would be happy to exchange nationalism for prosperity as the main
raison d'etre of the regime.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, China has substantially enhanced its prestige and
influence in East Asia through diplomacy and, in some cases,
financial aid. It does not want to see this trend upset by an upsurge
in tensions in the strait. Almost certainly, the Peoples Liberation
Army has urged the regime to delay any showdown over Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing may also believe that Taiwan's multiplying connections
across the strait will advance the possibilities of a peaceful
one-China resolution of Taiwan's status, whatever the revisionists
may want. Today, more than 50,000 Taiwanese companies have more than
$60 billion in investments on the mainland, more than 1 million
Taiwanese visit the mainland each year, and 400,000 Taiwanese
citizens live in Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the Chinese leaders calculate that the struggle for
President Bush's favor on the one-China issue is far from over. They
know the president wants a constructive relationship with China and
that many important interests and key individuals do not believe the
United States should keep open the option of using Taiwan as a
strategic base. Clearly, the Chinese don't want to undercut
traditionalists like Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. So, Hu is
coming to accentuate the positive.</TE>
<TE>   Still, administration revisionists must take heart in the fact
that Hu is in town. They have always contended that if the United
States made clear its determination to defend Taiwan under any
conceivable circumstance, China would live with it and eventually
with Taiwan's independence. Hu's current visit, as well as Zemin's
eagerness to stay at Bush's Texas ranch this fall, confirms this
view, contends the revisionists.</TE>
<TE>   They could be wrong, however. At some point, the Chinese people
could feel so strongly about what they would see as the final
violation of the unity of China that they would be willing to go to
war. The revisionists, and those in the upper echelon of the Bush
administration who apparently support them, notably Vice President
Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, no doubt have
thought this war scenario through. They realize that with only 2% of
the mainland's population, no matter how many F-16s, submarines, or
anti-missile missiles we sell Taiwan, the island would not likely
prevail in a prolonged conflict with China. A Chinese blockade, which
few nations would challenge, could quickly devastate the Taiwan
economy. Furthermore, the hawks understand that if the United States
intervened in such a conflict, regardless of how many thousands of
smart bombs it rained down on the mainland, China might outlast the
patience of the American people.</TE>
<TE>   That brings up the administration's Nuclear Posture Review, which,
for the first time, declared that the deployment of U.S. nuclear
weapons should take into account the possibility of a nuclear war
with China "over Taiwan." In other words, to maintain a potential
strategic offshore base for use in a hypothetical conflict with
China, we may have to fight a nuclear war with China. This would be
"a self-fulfilling prophecy" of biblical proportions.</TE>

<HD>The Garage's Potential Goes Beyond Parking and Storage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT J. BRUSS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Garage: Reinventing the Place We Park," by Kira Obolensky (Taunton
Press, Newtown, Conn.), $32, 199 pages.</LD>
<LD>   When I first saw "Garage" by Kira Obolensky, I wondered how anyone
could possibly write a book just about garages. But after delving
into this beautiful book, filled with lavish color photos of ordinary
and unusual garages, I quickly realized the untapped potential of
home garages.</LD>
<LD>   A few years ago I installed cabinets and a workbench along two
walls of my two-car garage. The third wall has bookshelves for the
overflow of my real estate library. There's even a TV.</LD>
<TE>   I thought my garage was unique. But reading this book, I
discovered far more creative uses that dozens of homeowners have
found for their garages.</TE>
<TE>   The book opens with a photo of a basketball half-court in a large
home garage. Then it evolves into a compilation of photos of various
garage uses. One whimsical photo shows a garage stacked to the
rafters with firewood.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the garages are beautifully finished, with tile floors and
Sheetrock walls. Others are humble, such as the one where Walt Disney
began his cartoon animation studio.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the book is devoted to garage design. One of the
issues raised, but never answered, is whether it is better to have an
attached or detached garage. Pros and cons of each are explained.</TE>
<TE>   There are also discussions of how to position the garage and
whether its doors should face the street.</TE>
<TE>   Massive garages, such as basketball star Shaquille O'Neal's
5,000-square-foot Florida garage, including a movie theater and room
for 10 cars, are mentioned.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to storing cars and junk, there are many other
practical uses shown, such as for hobbies, home offices and studios.</TE>
<TE>   As the book develops, the emphasis shifts to design ideas.
Carriage houses, new and renovated, are shown, along with solutions
to their special challenges. Two-story and high-ceiling garages
receive special attention because they offer different design
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Garage construction approval problems, such as city zoning
variances, are emphasized.</TE>
<TE>   Adding living quarters above the garage creates additional
problems and necessary solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Garage conversions are not overlooked. The book includes several
examples of buildings, such as old barns and fire stations, that have
been turned into garages and living quarters.</TE>
<TE>   With the emphasis on unusual, creative conversions, the photos and
explanations show what can be accomplished with minimal resources.</TE>
<TE>   This book broadens the perspective of the readers--whether they
have a small residential property or a massive estate--so they can
think differently about garages and their potential uses. It shows
what can be done to transform ordinary, mundane garages into
creative, attractive and useful space.</TE>

<LD>U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill has decided to table the
issue of banks' getting into the real estate business. O'Neill has
postponed for one year consideration of rules implementing the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which allows financial institutions to render
select realty services.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neill put his decision in a letter to the chairman of the House
Committee on Financial Services. He specifically cited 35,000 comment
letters that came into the treasurer's office. The National Assn. of
Realtors and the American Banking Assn. have launched full-scale
letter campaigns on the issue.</LD>

<HD>Report Finds Signs of Remodeling Rebound</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. spending on home remodeling fell less than 0.2% in the first
quarter from a year earlier, a sign that the recession was ending, a
Harvard University report said.</LD>
<LD>   Homeowners spent $106.5 billion on renovation supplies such as
tile, lumber and kitchen sinks, compared with $106.7 billion a year
earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Spending rose from $103.7 billion in the previous quarter,
according to the university's Joint Center for Housing Studies.</LD>
<TE>   In the fourth quarter, the recession and the September terrorist
attacks led to the biggest annualized drop in remodeling spending
since the center began tracking such statistics in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Spending has picked up since then because of an improving economy,
low interest rates and a record 5.3 million home resales last year,
said Nick Retsinas, director of the center.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Homeownership among Latinos surged during the economic boom of the
1990s, according to U.S. Census figures that also show differences in
living patterns among Latino groups.</LD>
<LD>   Recently released 2000 census data show that Cubans are more
likely than Mexicans to own their own homes, while Puerto Ricans are
much more likely to rent rather than buy.</LD>
<LD>   More flexible lending practices and the good economy helped boost
the homeownership rate for Latinos overall to a new high, though it
still lags far behind the national average for all people.</LD>
<TE>   The Latino rate grew from 42% in 1990 to 46%. Overall, 66% of all
American homes were owned in 2000, up from 64% a decade earlier.</TE>

<HD>Building Products Get Big Boost From Technology</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES CAREY and MORRIS CAREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's estimated that the average American home has 10,000 individual
parts and components--and uses another thousand or so specialized
glues, fasteners, caulks and sealants in the process of being built.</LD>
<LD>   If you're fascinated by home construction, remodeling or
improvement--especially what's new--the recent 2002 International
Builders Show in Atlanta was the place to be.</LD>
<LD>   Starting at the front door, technology is giving Mother Nature
serious competition with products that look, act and feel like the
real thing--only better. Fiberglass doors have been evolving over the
last few years, steadily improving to a point where they now rival
traditional wood and steel ones for beauty, strength and durability.</LD>
<TE>   Today you can have the deep, rich grain of premium natural wood
doors without swelling, cracking, warping and splintering. Or the
smooth, sleek look of steel without the dents, dings, scratches or
rust. Today's fiberglass doors offer energy efficiency, are
maintenance-free and come in an array of styles and decorative glass
options.</TE>
<TE>   Many new products at the show focused on health and environmental
features.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a number of building products contain urea
formaldehyde--from glues and insulation to particleboard to
carpeting--and its residual fumes can cause eye, nose and throat
irritation, nausea and, for some, serious skin rashes.</TE>
<TE>   Johns-Manville removed formaldehyde as a "binder" in its
insulation manufacturing process. Then it fully encapsulated its line
of batt insulation with a 360-degree poly-film wrap to make it more
installer-friendly, with less itching from airborne particles.</TE>
<TE>   To make installation faster and easier, Johns-Manville also
introduced batts with rows of vertical perforations every few
inches--running top to bottom--so insulation easily can be pulled
apart to fit narrow or nonstandard-size framing cavities, rather than
requiring tedious and time-consuming hand trimming.</TE>
<TE>   Usually such basic construction products as adhesives, caulks and
sealants are not big trendsetters, but this year even they are
changing. Ever-tightening federal regulations regarding the volatile
organic compounds, or VOCs, present in all solvent-based products,
which pollute indoor air and the environment, have manufacturers
seriously reformulating to comply. And while they are at it, they're
making these products better, stronger and longer-lasting.</TE>
<TE>   Since the upgrades are too numerous to list, stop by your local
hardware store or home center to see what's new--or go to the
Adhesive and Sealant Council Web site (www.ascouncil.org), or visit
Adhesives and Sealants Industry Online at www.adhesivemag.com.</TE>
<TE>   Another area receiving a boost from technology and smart thinking
is the lumber and sheathing used for everything from framing and
roofing to flooring and decks. For example, Louisiana-Pacific's new
TechShield radiant barrier roof sheathing is an aluminum sheet that
blocks 97% of the sun's radiant heat--leaving attics up to 30 degrees
cooler.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia-Pacific's new G-P Plus Plywood Sturdi-I-Floor offers
tongue-and-groove edges and a smooth, fully sanded face for direct
application of floor-covering products.</TE>
<TE>   There are many new options for deck building as well, with a wide
variety of maintenance-free engineered composite materials--both for
underfoot deck planking and for railings. These systems blend new
technology with multiple design options for easy-to-build,
long-lasting, maintenance-free decks.</TE>

<HD>It Takes a Village</HD>
<DH>The renewal of neighborhoods depends on new families moving
in and rejuvenating homes. In the Southland, strong demand fuels the
process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It happens continually. A "sold" sign goes up. Neighbors relocate,
while others move to retirement communities. Younger couples move in
and start families.</LD>
<LD>   "That neighborhoods change is an undisputed fact of life," said
Michael Dear, director of the Southern California Study Center at
USC, which monitors the region's future. "Neighborhoods, like people,
age."</LD>
<LD>   The evolution of a neighborhood is gradual: New homes are built
and the area is considered especially desirable. Families move in,
children grow up and eventually the residents age and die or move
away. A new wave of young families moves in and starts the process
all over again.</LD>
<TE>   Neighborhoods essentially repeat themselves. This constant renewal
goes on indefinitely, as long as the homes remain in good condition.</TE>
<TE>   "The difficulty comes when the houses start to age and reach the
end of their natural life span, which tends to happen to homes in a
neighborhood all at once," Dear said. "At that point they drop to the
lower end of the scale in terms of desirability."</TE>
<TE>   By some estimates the average life of a house in the U.S. is 44
years, but homes are often ready for renovation within a few decades.
According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard, a large
share of homes in the Sunbelt are now in the 25- to 30-year-old
range, considered the threshold for increased spending on home
improvements.</TE>
<TE>   For older neighborhoods to remain viable and for renewal to occur,
several things must then happen.</TE>
<TE>   "There has to be a continued demand for the property and land and
a constant influx of new people who are willing to buy the property
and regenerate it, putting in a lot of money and time," Dear said.</TE>
<TE>   Due to migration--27% of total household growth nationwide in this
decade will come from immigration, experts predict--and a resulting
high demand for property, this process of gentrification has become a
natural part of our neighborhood fabric.</TE>
<TE>   "Southern California is one of the most vibrant metropolitan
communities in the United States, with a strong economy and demand
for housing, which has led to neighborhoods naturally evolving in a
manner that is barely noticeable," Dear said. "You almost don't
notice that someone at the end of the street has bought the house and
is upgrading it."</TE>
<TE>   Other parts of the country have not been as fortunate.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the past two or three decades, areas in the Midwest and
Northeast, such as Cleveland and Detroit, have experienced
abandonment from older housing units and as a result, entire
neighborhoods have died," Dear said. "The demise of these
neighborhoods dates back to the deindustrialization of the United
States that began in the 1970s. At that point the influx of people
into these geographic areas began to dwindle, resulting in a
diminished need for housing."</TE>
<TE>   With strong migration into Southern California has come an
eclectic mix of population types and ages, another component of a
healthy neighborhood. "If you have a good mix of people," Dear said,
"the self-renewal process is a natural thing."</TE>
<TE>   Matt Keefe has lived in Old Towne Orange since 1988 and has seen a
tremendous amount of revitalization in the area, which has a large
concentration of pre-1940 homes of various architectural styles, some
dating as far back as the 1880s.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the past several years, people have moved into the
neighborhood and poured disposable income into upkeeping and
maintaining their homes," said Keefe, a professional photographer.
"This has been great overall, because it increases our property
values and is aesthetically appealing."</TE>
<TE>   Keefe has also found that the demographics of his neighborhood
have changed over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first moved in, the neighborhood was more static," he
said. "Since then, some of the older people have retired or passed
away and now there are a lot of younger couples starting families and
revitalizing the community. I personally enjoy seeing children
walking the block and watching them grow up. I think a good
demographic mix can only benefit the neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Donna Hopson has noticed the same sort of revitalization occurring
recently in her 40-year-old Tustin neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "When we bought our home 13 years ago, there was very little
turnover," said Hopson, who co-owns a pension service company. "As
many of the former occupants aged, they didn't do anything with their
homes, and the properties became very dated and tired looking. In
recent years, new owners have come in and modernized the houses. The
renovations have created a spark in the neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Neighborhood transformation and demographic changes aren't without
their drawbacks, however. Author and social psychologist Susan K.
Perry moved into her Silver Lake community in 1969 and raised two
children there. During the years when her kids were young, she
enjoyed the company of a next-door neighbor who had children of the
same age.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a great time," Perry said. "My neighbor and I were very
close, and our kids played together all of the time."</TE>
<TE>   Perry's neighborhood is still her home, but she is more isolated
than she once was. "It's more difficult to make friends in your
neighborhood when your children are gone, because they are the
context of your becoming friends in the first place."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Oldewage has been in her Santa Ana neighborhood for nearly
50 years, since 1954.</TE>
<TE>   "Although there are still some of us older people here, for the
most part the neighborhood has changed drastically, and there's not
much option for socializing when everyone's younger than you,"
Oldewage said. "We've been through two or three phases of small
children followed by quiet stages with no children. We're in a
small-children stage again."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the changes, which can be unsettling at times, those
entrenched in a neighborhood often share Oldewage's sentiment:
"Things might be different, but it's still home."</TE>
<TE>   "We're comfortable," she said, "and we wouldn't want to be
anywhere else."</TE>

<HD>Owner Is Troubled by Board's Handling of Fees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN GLASSMAN and DONIE VANITZIAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I bought my unit in Santa Monica three years ago because it
is not in a luxury building, there are only eight units and there is
no management company. Last year our monthly fees increased from $110
to $150, and they are about to be raised again without an adequate
reason.</LD>
<LD>   Before I bought, I had no way of knowing there is a clique of
homeowners that controls everything.</LD>
<LD>   To date, our homeowners association has not complied with
California's 1994 earthquake retrofitting requirements. Retrofitting
plans were drawn up several times before my purchase but no one
followed through. When I purchased, funding to retrofit was readily
available, but because of the domination of this clique of
homeowners, their board buddies failed to secure that funding.</LD>
<TE>   We have no reserves. All homeowners are now hit with three large
special assessments. Though this doesn't seem to bother the clique,
it is a tremendous hardship for me.</TE>
<TE>   When I bought, my real estate agent requested only a year's worth
of minutes. Despite the board's knowledge and prior discussions,
there was no mention of retrofitting in the minutes given to me. I
have reason to believe the minutes were contrived for my benefit so I
would purchase the unit.</TE>
<TE>   I have phoned mediators, arbitrators and lawyers. They all want
payment, and I can't afford their fees. The board said they will not
cooperate with a mediator or arbitrator and they know I can't afford
to file a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   What am I supposed to do about these problems?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Your board's obligation to repair, replace and maintain
the common property, as stated in the Davis-Stirling Act, gives it
the right to specially assess for that purpose, although the money
raised must be used for those specific repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Special assessments require the approval of a majority of the
owner-members of the association unless the special assessment is
less than 5% of the homeowner association's operating budget. Then no
vote is required.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of your monthly assessments, the increase you
experienced was more than allowed by law without a homeowner vote. If
there was no vote, the increase, 36%, would be invalid under the law
and may not have to be paid.</TE>
<TE>   There is no requirement that homeowners associations maintain a
reserve account under the Davis-Stirling Act, only that if there is
one, an accounting of it be provided.</TE>
<TE>   Though it should, the Davis-Stirling Act does not give buyers the
right to inspect minutes of the association, and there is nothing in
the law that states minutes must be "accurate." This means there is
no way for you to verify accuracy. You are relying on the board's
"good faith" to provide accurate reporting in the minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Falsifying minutes is a breach of a board's fiduciary duties to
all homeowners and, if proven, could subject the association to
liability for damages you suffered in relying on those minutes. The
difficulties lie in proving your assertion and the cost of
litigation. Saving the minutes you were given may prove vital should
you become involved in a lawsuit with your board and would counter
efforts by them to introduce different minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Mediation and arbitration offer no real solution since, in most
cases, the process is not free and the decisions are not binding on
the parties. The informality of the process can also be unjust, as
arbitrators and mediators are not "required" to rely on legal
precedents or the evidence code in reaching their decisions. Some
boards rely on the fact that most homeowners do not have a ready
stash of excess cash on hand to litigate protecting their rights and
interests.</TE>
<TE>   If your building is one that was ordered retrofitted by a city,
county or state agency, your board has the obligation to comply but
it also has an obligation to notify the owners that a special
assessment will be necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the statute of limitations, if the retrofit order was
issued before your purchase and noncompliance exists, you may have
recourse against the seller of your unit or the real estate broker
for failing to disclose the retrofitting requirement, your board's
noncompliance and the fact that a special assessment was necessary.
Any assessment made before your owning the unit is the obligation of
the prior owner, and you may be able to recover from that owner or
avoid paying that portion of the assessment as it is not your
responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   If your association assesses for retrofitting now, you will have
to pay that assessment. Check your homeowner's insurance policy to
see if it contains an "excess assessment" rider. If it does, this
will often cover a special assessment levied against the
homeowner-policyholder. If you don't carry this coverage, contact
your insurance agent.</TE>

<HD>Replace Tub Spout for a Better Shower</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MORRIS CAREY and JAMES CAREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: The bathtub knobs for hot and cold water are separate and
there is a stopper to allow the water to go to the shower. When the
stopper is pulled up, the shower works, but there is still water
coming through the spout in the tub. How can I stop this water from
going into the tub and redirect it to the showerhead?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Your showerhead and tub spout are connected to the same
pipe. When you toggle the valve lever on the spout (the diverter
valve), you redirect water from there to the showerhead.</LD>
<LD>   Once in the redirected position, this type of valve often leaks to
some extent. But if you are experiencing excessive leakage, you might
want to replace the tub spout, thus ending up with a new valve, and
possibly, less leaking.</LD>
<TE>   Cleaning your showerhead also should help by improving the head's
ability to freely pass water. Clean the showerhead by filling a
plastic bag with undiluted vinegar. Place the bag around the
showerhead like a feedbag for a horse. Fully immerse the head in the
vinegar.</TE>
<TE>   Tie the open end of the bag in place around the shower arm with a
twist tie or a rubber band, and let sit for 24 hours. Run the shower
for about a minute once you remove the bag; it should run more
freely.</TE>
<TE>   To replace the tub spout, first determine whether the spout is
held onto the plumbing pipe with a threaded connection or if it is a
slip connection. Look at the underside of the spout. If there is a
screw, remove it, and the valve should slip off.</TE>
<TE>   If no screw is visible on the base of the spout, simply turn it
counterclockwise and unscrew to remove it. If a screw exists and you
can't seem to slip it loose, try unscrewing it. Some have both a
threaded connection and a retaining screw.</TE>
<TE>   There is no better diverter than the kind that works exactly like
the hot- and cold-water valves themselves. Single valves are
available for this purpose. Unfortunately, installing such a valve
could be expensive because you would have to gain access to the wall
interior.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure-Treated Lumber</TE>
<TE>   a Danger in the Garden</TE>
<TE>   Q: I am planning to use pressure-treated landscape timbers for a
raised vegetable garden. Others have told me that I need to be
concerned about the chemicals that may leach out and affect the
vegetables. Should I be concerned? What chemicals may leach out? Do
you know if these chemicals are likely to be transferred into the
food I plan to eat?</TE>
<TE>   A: There is a danger using pressure-treated wood to surround a
garden. Pressure-treated lumber is injected with chemicals--the most
common of which is copper chrome arsenate--that resist damage by
moisture and pests. There are several degrees of concentration of the
chemical, depending on the intended use of the wood.</TE>
<TE>   For example, fence posts that will be underground contain a higher
concentration of the poison than do fence boards that will not be
used underground.</TE>
<TE>   But the degree of concentration is academic when it comes to any
possibility of ingesting the chemical. The companies that make
pressure-treated wood will tell you that it is safe for deck surfaces
and furniture.</TE>
<TE>   We disagree. Anywhere that a toddler who chews can easily gain
access to pressure-treated wood, we feel, is cause for concern.</TE>
<TE>   We think that pressure-treated lumber is superior to any other
kind for use outside (deck framing--not the finished decking) or in
contact with the earth or other regularly wet surfaces (retaining
walls, foundation mudsill, and such).</TE>
<TE>   If it were our garden we would use plain wood. Cedar and redwood
are good choices.</TE>
<TE>   Oil-Base Primer May</TE>
<TE>   Stop Crackling Effect</TE>
<TE>   Q: My husband and I recently bought a 100-year-old home. In the
process of painting the plaster-walled library, we're running into
problems.</TE>
<TE>   The walls were triple-painted in a brush pattern--we think within
the last 10 years. We bought flat paint and proceeded to apply two
coats. After letting them dry we noticed dark stripes down the walls,
and the whole surface is crackling in 1/8-inch pieces.</TE>
<TE>   We went to the hardware store where we bought the paint and
explained our problem. We bought a new primer and primed the entire
room. Now the primer is doing the same thing as the other coats--as
is a small spot where we test-painted over the primer. What can we do
now?</TE>
<TE>   A: We assume the three-color painting detail to which you refer is
sponge or splatter paint. We make this assumption because the glaze
that is used with sponge or splatter paint--once painted--will render
the crackling effect you describe.</TE>
<TE>   Now that you know the cause of the problem, you need to eliminate
it. There are several ways to do this: You can sand, but that's
messy. You can use paint remover--even messier. Or, you can paint
with a material that will not be affected by the existing glaze. This
would be the easiest way.</TE>
<TE>   Try applying a coat of oil-base primer to a 2-square-foot area.
Water-base will not work. Once it's sealed with the oil-base primer,
any kind of finish coat can be used. If the oil-base primer doesn't
work, cover the walls with a quarter-inch-thick layer of gyp board.</TE>

<AU>RUTH RYON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A replica of a 17th century villa built for a duke in Florence,
Italy, this house reeks of old Hollywood. Built in the early 1920s at
a cost of $500,000, it was the home in those early days of screen
legend Norma Talmadge.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by a retired UCLA professor since he bought it at an auction
in 1969, the mansion now houses thousands of his books, but
otherwise, little has changed since Talmadge lived there. "It is all
original," the listing agent said, "but it does need some restoration
work."</LD>
<LD>   The home has a 28-foot-high foyer with a Baccarat crystal
chandelier, a Rococo dome fresco ceiling, stained-glass windows and a
terrazzo floor. The 20-foot-high ceiling in the living room has
decoratively painted wood beams, and a ballroom features gold-leaf
columns, a gold inlaid ceiling and an outside balcony.</LD>
<TE>   Among the remarkable sights are four gigantic fireplaces, three
guarded by statues resembling the lion that is the symbol for MGM.</TE>
<TE>   About the home: Talmadge isn't the only Hollywood luminary who has
lived in the house. Others were Jimi Hendrix, Ralph Bellamy and Rod
McKuen. Many more have partied there, and some have made movies in
the house. The house also has been featured in a number of TV shows.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $3.6 million</TE>
<TE>   Size: Six bedrooms and 6.5 bathrooms in close to 10,000 square
feet, on just less than half an acre; three bedroom suites in the
main house, a maid's and cook's quarters in the full-size basement,
and a guest apartment above the detached three-car garage.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The estate also has a library and a solarium.</TE>
<TE>   Where: Los Feliz</TE>
<TE>   Contact: Nevianna Hristova, DBL Los Feliz, (323) 665-1700, Ext.

<TE>   To submit a candidate for Home of the Week, please send color
interior and exterior photos (copies only, please; we cannot return
the pictures) and a brief description of the house, including what

<LD>Actress Drew Barrymore has purchased a Hollywood Hills home on nearly
1.5 acres for about $4.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   Barrymore had been leasing since her former Beverly Hills-area
home sustained fire damage in February 2001. She subsequently sold
that property.</LD>
<LD>   Described as a "two-story, mid-century ranch with a long private
drive," the compound she bought includes a four-bedroom main house
with a two-story living room, a guest house and a guard house that is
staffed full time.</LD>
<TE>   The estate, estimated to have about 9,000 square feet of living
space, also has a gym, five fireplaces and a billiard room with a
bar. The grounds, behind gates, have a motor court, views from
downtown L.A. to the ocean, a pool and a yard with pathways and
gardens.</TE>
<TE>   Barrymore, 27, has a leading role in the comedy "Confessions of a
Dangerous Mind," due out later this year, and stars opposite Ben
Stiller in "The Duplex," expected to be released in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   She starred in "Riding in Cars With Boys" (2001) and co-starred
with Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu in the movie version of the 1970s TV
series "Charlie's Angels" (2000), which she also produced. Barrymore
also appeared at age 7 in "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," re-released
in March.</TE>
<TE>   Brett Lawyer and Ed Fitz of Nourmand &amp; Associates, Beverly Hills,
represented Barrymore in buying, according to sources not involved in
the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Mariska Hargitay, who plays Detective Olivia Benson on the NBC
series "Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit," has listed her Sunset
Strip-area home at just under $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The actress, daughter of the late actress Jayne Mansfield and
former bodybuilder-actor Mickey Hargitay, has been living in New York
and periodically leasing out the house. It's also available to lease
at $8,750 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1988, the Mediterranean-style home has five bedrooms in
about 3,000 square feet. The home also has city views, arched
doorways, a loft/office with a fireplace, a two-story guest house and
a newly built pool.</TE>
<TE>   Hargitay was 3 when her mother was killed at 34 in a car accident
in 1967. The little girl and two of her brothers from Mansfield's
marriage to Mickey Hargitay were asleep in the back seat at the time
of the accident, and none of the children was injured.</TE>
<TE>   Mansfield had divorced Hargitay before the crash, but he raised
his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Russell, director of "The Scorpion King" and
director-executive producer of other films such as "Eraser" (1996)
and "The Mask" (1994), has sold his Bel-Air home for just under $2.9
million, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The director, who is in his 40s, recently bought a larger Westside
home in a gated community.</TE>
<TE>   The 7,000-square-foot house that they sold has four bedrooms, a
gym and an entertainment room that opens to a tennis court and a
lagoon pool with a waterfall.</TE>
<TE>   June Scott of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills North, had the
listing.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Doyle, who composed the music for "Bridget Jones's Diary"
and "Gosford Park," and his wife, Leslie, have purchased a home in
the Beverly Hills area for close to its $1.6-million asking price.</TE>
<TE>   The Scottish film composer, 49, and his wife also have homes in
London and France.</TE>
<TE>   They bought a California ranch-style home with a pool. The house,
with three bedrooms and maid's quarters in about 3,600 square feet,
was built in the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   Jana Jones-Duffy and Fred Holley of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills
South, represented the couple in their purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Max Kleven, who directed the underwater unit in "What Lies
Beneath" (2000) and has been director of action units on such films
as the upcoming "Spider-Man," has listed his gated ranch and tennis
estate on about 7.5 acres in Agua Dulce, 14 miles north of the San
Fernando Valley, at $2.8 million, fully furnished including a grand
piano.</TE>
<TE>   Kleven, a producer-director-writer with more than 30 years of
experience in filmmaking, plans to sell his estate because he has
taken an interest in building a Southwest-style home on nearby land.</TE>
<TE>   He renovated the Mediterranean-style home he listed, adding a wall
of glass. Built in 1974, the three-bedroom, 4,000-square-foot main
house has views of the Sierra foothills, heated floors and fireplaces
in the kitchen and living room. The property also has a
three-bedroom, 2,000-square-foot guest house; a lighted tennis court;
a pool; a pool house with a fireplace; a six-car garage; a motor home
garage; two workshops; nine corrals; and a tack room.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Rodgers and John Barker have the listing at Pinnacle
Estate Properties, Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Pitt was once in escrow to buy an 11,000-square-foot home
being constructed by Steve Meepos on 2.5 acres in the Beverly Hills
area, but he didn't want to wait for the house being built there to
be completed, sources said. Neither did Lisa Kudrow, who also
expressed interest in buying it.</TE>
<TE>   So now it is on the market at $13.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   The house, behind gates, will have five bedrooms, guest and maid's
quarters, a media room, a tennis court, a pool, 100-year-old pine
trees and city-to-ocean views.</TE>
<TE>   It's being built on the site of actor Michael Caine's former home,
which Meepos razed. It was noted for its indoor-outdoor pool, which
was turned into a spa by a subsequent owner.</TE>
<TE>   Caine's house was built by Woolworth dime-store heiress Barbara
Hutton for her son, Lance Reventlow, in 1956. Designed in the shape
of an L for Lance, the house did not take full advantage of the
views, as does the newly built home.</TE>
<TE>   Meepos kept the tennis court but is turning a tennis cabana into a
pavilion, and he is building a pool house twice the size of the
original.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Hyland of Hilton &amp; Hyland, Beverly Hills, has the listing.</TE>
<TE>   High-end residential real estate on the Westside has been hotter
than ever, according to Cecelia Waeschle, who tracks high-end sales
for Coldwell Banker.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I started doing the list in 1987, the number of home sales
at more than $3 million each has quadrupled," she said.</TE>
<TE>   This year to date, 99 homes have sold at more than $3 million
each, in contrast with 82 for the same period of last year. Forty
have been sold so far this year at more than $5 million each; at this
point last year, there were 32.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Don't Open a House to Theft" by Ilyce Glink (April 14):
The story left out an important item that sellers should also put in
a safe place: prescription drugs. During an open house for brokers,
my client's prescription drugs were taken from a medicine cabinet in
a bathroom by a scam artist who said her broker had sent her to look
at the house. She did it in seconds flat.</LD>

<TE>   Before an open house or any house showing, all the valuable items
should be tacked down with a little museum wax, available in most
hardware stores, and marked with a little bit of red crepe paper. The
wax will hold the item firmly on the shelf, but with enough of a tug,
the item can still be removed. A little application of red crepe
paper in the right place (on top of part of the wax, leaving some of
the wax exposed to adhere to the bottom of the item) could deter a
thief since it would take too much time to remove the paper. And if
the paper is not removed, it would be obvious that an item was taken.</TE>

<TE>   Degreasing Driveways</TE>
<TE>   Regarding "Degrease Driveway With Cola, Cat Litter" (April 21) by
Morris and James Carey: They suggest whitening the gray stain on a
concrete driveway with powdered laundry detergent and liquid chlorine
bleach, then washing it away with hot water.</TE>
<TE>   Do they not realize that the detergent and bleach and some grease
residue would end up in the sewer, which in most cases drains into
the ocean?</TE>
<TE>   To help keep pollution under control, perhaps they could have
suggested a heat steam cleaner or a more environmentally safe method.</TE>

<TE>   Affordable Housing</TE>
<TE>   Regarding "Solutions for Seniors" (April 7) by Diane Wedner: Our
nonprofit organization, Retirement Housing Foundation, or RHF, has
been a solution for thousands of Angelenos over the years. One of our
largest communities, Angelus Plaza, is in the heart of downtown Los
Angeles, providing affordable food and shelter for more than 1,000
residents since 1981.</TE>
<TE>   We also provide affordable housing and services in at least 20
more senior housing communities, not quite as big as Angelus, in the
L.A. area. We have long waiting lists at times, but for most it's
worth the wait. We are also expanding to meet the demand with the
recent completion of Colonia Jess Lopez, an 88-unit affordable
housing complex in the Boyle Heights area.</TE>
<TE>   For more information on RHF, a national organization based in Long
Beach, visit www.rhf.org.</TE>

<TE>   Gas Shut-Off Valves</TE>
<TE>   Recent rulings by the L.A. City Council and the California Public
Utilities Commission regarding apartment units prohibit installation
of emergency earthquake gas shut-off valves on the gas company side
of the gas meters; protection can be provided only by installing
separate earthquake gas shut-off valves for each apartment.</TE>
<TE>   The result is to discourage owners wishing to install earthquake
shut-off values as a safety precaution for their buildings, because
the associated cost escalates from a few hundred dollars for one
valve and installation to a few thousand dollars for even a small
building. Related laws and regulations need to be amended, so they
promote rather than inhibit their objective.</TE>
<TE>   I was going to put gas quake valves into my building which is not
already so equipped. After speaking with the gas company and
realizing that the cost had escalated from about $400 to more than
$2,000 for my smallest (seven-unit) building, I decided to postpone
the improvements indefinitely.</TE>

<HD>Rent Hike Notices May Arrive by Mail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Project Sentinel</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I just received a rent increase notice in the mail. My
landlord says she now can send rent increase notices through the
mail. Is this true?</LD>
<LD>   Answer:  The law has changed. Effective Jan. 1, 2001, Civil Code
827 and Civil Code Procedures 1013 allow for a rent increase notice
to be served on a tenant by first-class mail or by Express Mail only.</LD>
<LD>   But rent increase notices can still be served directly to a tenant
(known as "personal" service). They can also be handed to a third
person at the rental unit (known as "substituted" service).
Substituted service requires another copy of the notice to be mailed
by first-class mail to the tenant's address.</LD>
<TE>   Posting rent increase notices on doors, even if a copy is also
mailed, is no longer considered proper service. It is recommended
that mailed increase notices not be sent by certified mail, return
receipt requested, because the recipient can refuse it. If a rent
increase notice is sent by first-class or express mail, the effective
date for the increase is extended by five calendar days. This means
that a 30-day notice (for an increase of 10% or less) becomes a
35-day notice and a 60-day notice (for an increase of more than 10%)
becomes a 65-day notice from the date the notice is dropped in the
mail. The 35- or 65-day rule applies only to mailed rent increase
notices--not other types of changes made to a tenancy.</TE>
<TE>   If the place of mailing is outside of California but within the
United States, the notice is extended for 10 calendar days, or 20
days if mailed from outside the United States. Rent increase notices
served by fax are permitted only if both parties have agreed in
writing to this service. For notice by fax, the time period is
extended by two court days. A court day is any day the court is open,
i.e., all weekdays, except holidays.</TE>
<TE>   All mailed notices must bear a notation of the date and place of
mailing and all faxed notices must list the date and place of
transmission as well as the telephone number to which the notice was
faxed.</TE>
<TE>   This rule allowing service of rent increases by first-class mail
is not allowed for other changes to a tenancy, such as new house
rules or pets. Service for these changes can only be by personal or
substituted service.</TE>
<TE>   If Lease Is Broken Early,</TE>
<TE>   Fee May Be Enforced</TE>
<TE>   Q: My one-year lease contains a break-lease clause, which requires
me to pay an additional one-month's rent if I leave before the lease
expires. I am thinking about relocating to be closer to my family. Is
this break-lease fee enforceable if I move early?</TE>
<TE>   A: The answer is probably yes. As a general rule, a tenant who
breaks a lease is responsible for the remaining rent under the term
of the lease, subject to the landlord's duty to mitigate those
damages by taking reasonable action to find a replacement tenant. The
tenant is also responsible for the re-rental expenses such as
advertising.</TE>
<TE>   In practice, it can be difficult to predict or calculate the
actual damages. For example, the parties can disagree about whether
the landlord missed opportunities to re-rent. The resulting damages
can be difficult to collect even if a judgment is obtained.</TE>
<TE>   A break-lease fee is an attempt by both parties to eliminate these
uncertainties by negotiating a finite limit on the losses in advance.
As long as the clause was considered by the parties at the time the
lease was signed, it should be enforceable. But the fee is binding on
both parties. A landlord cannot collect the break-lease fee and then
also seek the full damages if the unit is not rented quickly.</TE>
<TE>   How Deposit Is Handled</TE>
<TE>   Depends on Location</TE>
<TE>   Q: My tenant has requested that I pay her interest on her deposit
and that I also provide a bank statement showing that her security
deposit has been put in a special savings account. To my knowledge, I
can do anything I want with deposits I collect. The only
responsibility I have is to settle the deposit after a tenant moves.
Is this correct?</TE>
<TE>   A: Unless the rental property is in a city with a rent-control
ordinance that requires interest be paid on security deposits, there
is no state law that requires a landlord to pay interest or to keep
security deposit funds in a special savings account.</TE>
<TE>   There is a difference between having to pay interest on a security
deposit and having to keep the funds in an interest-bearing account.
Locally, only Santa Monica requires deposits to be kept in a separate
interest-bearing account.</TE>

<LD>Detect an awful odor coming from your sink?</LD>
<LD>   All plumbing fixtures in the home are connected to the same waste
system. Sewer gases are prevented from backing up into the house by
p-traps.</LD>
<LD>   A p-trap, the curved drainpipe under your sink, traps water
between the fixture and the sewer line. It's a water door. A p-trap
can become filled with so much hair and grease that water is
displaced and sewer gas is allowed to escape into the house.</LD>
<TE>   Keep p-traps clean and clear by pouring a mild acid or caustic
down the drain. Vinegar works well if used regularly--weekly would be
ideal.</TE>

<HD>Wallace's Dirty Work Has Been Paying Off</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Piston forward only player in NBA who
ranked in top 20 in rebounds, blocks and steals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON LA CANFORA</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>AUBURN HILLS, Mich.</DL>
<LD>A rotund middle-aged man wobbles onto a basketball court with a red R
painted on his drooping stomach. One section behind him a row of fans
sport white T-shirts with that same R displayed prominently.</LD>
<LD>   Children wearing Afro wigs are scattered throughout the arena.
Chants of "M-V-P, M-V-P" rise whenever the Detroit Pistons emerge
from their locker room at the Palace of Auburn Hills.</LD>
<LD>   This scene is an homage to one powerful individual, a man who has
captured a city with his placid personality, rugged determination and
occasionally flamboyant hair.</LD>
<TE>   Ben Wallace, an undrafted free agent from tiny Virginia Union
University in Richmond who begged and scrapped his way to his first
NBA tryout with Washington nearly six years ago, has become one of
the most feared and respected players in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Wallace was voted the NBA's defensive player of the
year by the widest margin in league history, taking 116 of 120 votes.</TE>
<TE>   He was the fourth player in NBA history, and the first forward, to
lead the league in rebounds (13.0 per game) and blocks (3.5 per game)
in the same season, joining Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
(1975-76) and Bill Walton (1976-77), and future Hall of Famer Hakeem
Olajuwon (1989-90).</TE>
<TE>   Wallace's all-out pursuit of rebounds is the cause for the
proliferation of the red R around Detroit and his overall defensive
dominance has fans calling for him to be named the league's most
valuable player.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace, 27, is so popular that the Pistons created two
bobble-head dolls in his likeness -- one with his hair pointed to the
heavens in a vintage 1970s Afro, as he wears it most often, and
another with his hair in braids--perhaps the most tangible testament
to his burgeoning fame.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't going to change me one way or the other," Wallace
said, oozing a laid-back, down-home charm. "I'm still going to go out
there and work hard and try to improve my game. I'm going to stay the
same as a person. I'm always going to stay grounded. If you stay
grounded and stay humble then all of the media and all of the hype
doesn't really get to you. It hasn't changed me at all."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace's will and determination are unmistakable whenever he
takes the court. He tracks down loose balls everywhere, out-muscles
taller players above the rim, snatches rebounds out of the air with
one hand while fending off an opponent with the other, heads to the
bench after twisting his ankle, then returns a few minutes later to
repeat the process all over again. He can be unstoppable, as he was
in an 85-63 win over Toronto on Sunday night in the opening game of
their best-of-five playoff series, when Wallace scored 19 points and
tore down 20 rebounds in 37 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I respect him because he's a man's man," said Piston Coach Rick
Carlisle, who called writers in every NBA city to lobby Wallace for
defensive player of the year. "He's all about doing his job, he's all
about going to work and he's all about playing hard and playing the
right way."</TE>
<TE>   Doing the dirty work is what got Wallace to the NBA, and he is not
about to stop now. Wallace, who has 10 siblings, was given no chance
of an NBA future when he left Virginia Union, a Division II school.
After being passed up in the draft, Wallace drove up from Virginia,
paid his own expenses and talked his way into joining summer workouts
and scrimmages with the Bullets (later to be renamed the Wizards).</TE>
<TE>   His physique--a chiseled 6-foot-9, 240 pounds--demanded immediate
attention and it quickly became apparent that Wallace had serious
potential.</TE>
<TE>   Washington signed him in October 1996. Wallace appeared in just 34
games his rookie season (1996-97), but by 1998-99 he led the team in
rebounds per game (8.3). Despite his promise, Washington included
Wallace in one of their infamous lopsided trades, sending him to
Orlando along with Jeff McInnis (now the starting point guard for the
Los Angeles Clippers), Tim Legler and Terry Davis. Washington landed
Ike Austin, a total bust.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace's stint in Orlando was short as well. The Magic felt it
already had a strong power forward in Bo Outlaw and could not afford
to sign both players, so they sent Wallace and point guard Chucky
Atkins to Detroit for superstar Grant Hill after the 1999-2000
season.</TE>
<TE>   At the time most NBA insiders thought the Pistons had been
fleeced. But Hill has played just 18 games over the last two seasons
because of chronic ankle injuries, while Atkins and Wallace led a
Detroit revival, helping the team go from 32-50 last season to 50-32
this season, clinching their first Central Division title since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace, the only player in the NBA's top 20 in blocks, rebounds
and steals, is indeed in perpetual motion on the court.</TE>
<TE>   Last week he sealed the rebounding and blocked shot crown with a
typically ferocious performance against the Milwaukee Bucks, keeping
Detroit's hated rival out of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace snatched two rebounds in the first 44 seconds, had nine
boards in the first 11 minutes and finished with 20 rebounds in 33
minutes as the Pistons cruised to a 34-point win.</TE>
<TE>   "Rebounding is natural; it's something you've got within you,"
Wallace said. "You can't learn it. You can't teach a guy how to
rebound. You can't teach a guy how to play defense. You can put him
in a position to do it, but it's still up to him whether or not he
wants to rebound or he wants to play defense."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Stackhouse, Detroit's leading scorer, estimates there is at
least one player on every NBA team who simply will not drive to the
hoop if Wallace is planted in the lane. His mere presence is a
deterrent.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't have to do anything now, he can do it on reputation
alone, almost," Stackhouse said. "Every night you see guys jumping
away trying to avoid contact with Ben, and he wasn't even trying to
block their shot and they wind up missing a layup anyway, just
because of his presence. Not only does he block shots, he changes a
lot of shots and changes a lot of guy's will and drive to go to the
basket because he's waiting for them."</TE>

<HD>Contraction Motivates Teams, Not Negotiators</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BOSWELL</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many methods have been used to motivate major league players.</LD>
<LD>   The late Billy Martin once shut his door and smashed everything in
his office, from furniture to framed pictures. Players and reporters
peeked inside to see the destruction. It gave a whole new meaning to
"the manager wants to see you ... in his office."</LD>
<LD>   But now an even better method may have been invented. And by
commissioner Bud Selig, no less. He's threatened to contract two
entire teams out of existence. Put every man on those deleted clubs
out on the cold, cruel open market. Now that's motivation. Whole
teams are now "playing for their jobs."</LD>
<TE>   If only Selig could do for the Milwaukee Brewers (7-12), who are
owned by his daughter, what he has done for the Minnesota Twins and
Montreal Expos. By putting out a public hit on both franchises, he
has inspired both teams to heroic levels of self-interest. Both clubs
are in first place.</TE>
<TE>   You may have heard of the New York Mets and Atlanta Braves--rich,
classy big-market teams. Well, they're currently behind "our" Expos,
who are 11-8 in the National League East. The Twins (13-6) have the
fourth-best record in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   This week, all eyes won't be on the Yankees playing the A's or the
Diamondbacks meeting the Braves. Instead, a three-game Bud Bowl began
last night with Selig's Brewers visiting the Expos in Montreal, the
sport's City of the Damned. Gimme those 'Spos.</TE>
<TE>   Why, just look at the league leaders entering last night's games.
Expos catcher Mike Barrett, a career .259 hitter, was second to Barry
Bonds in the National League in hitting at .404. Now there's a man
who wants a job in the major leagues next season.</TE>
<TE>   There may be no "I" in "team." But there are two in Torii Hunter,
the Twins' outfielder with a .264 career average. Suddenly, Torii's
looking out for No. 1. He's leading the American League in hitting at
.405. The Expos' Vladimir Guerrero is tied for the NL lead in RBI
(21), while the Twins' Eddie Guardado leads the AL in saves (eight).
Selig may soon replace Tony Robbins on the motivational speaking
circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Why didn't somebody think of this before?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the big leagues should operate like some European soccer
leagues. Send the worst teams of each season down to a lower division
for the next year. Send the players, too. Let 'em swap salaries with
the guys you bring up.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins and Expos appear to have gotten a rude reality check
concerning the life of luxury that they've been living in the big
leagues. Their attitude adjustment has been swift.</TE>
<TE>   Now if only a similar method of draconian motivation could be
found to force the players' union and baseball's owners to get off
the dime in their current labor talks.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides have been meeting this week. They'll chat again
early next month. Here's the kind of progress they're achieving. The
owners want the percentage of local revenue that's shared among teams
to increase from 20 percent to 50 percent. The union's most recent
counterproposal has been 22.5 percent.</TE>
<TE>   At this rate, we'll have an agreement by Christmas. Of 2020. Memo
to Selig and union boss Don Fehr: You're already halfway to a legacy
as the most destructive figure in the history of baseball. Are you
trying to complete the job you started in '94?</TE>
<TE>   There's some what-formula-do-we-use spin on that 22.5 percent. But
it's mostly just what it looks like. The union is acting tough. The
membership got blindsided, to their way of thinking, by Selig's
unilateral post-World Series announcement of contraction. So they're
flexing their muscles right back.</TE>
<TE>   Months ago, the union knew the sport had enough financial
problems, and owners were sufficiently united, that they'd need to go
into the 35-percent range on revenue sharing, at the very least.</TE>
<TE>   But, in baseball labor negotiations, nobody can ever get up out of
the dirt, brush off his uniform and get on with the game. There
always has to be a retaliatory knockdown pitch. That's one reason the
sport is eight-for-eight in potential work stoppages--a record no
other sport will ever break, because no other sport is wonderful
enough to survive such abuse from the people who profit from it.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody has known for a generation that you can't trust the
owners when they tell you how much money they are, or aren't, making.
Forbes magazine recently valued every team in baseball and, in the
process, did a good job of shredding the idea that owning a baseball
franchise is a sucker's game. Among other things, a half-dozen clubs
report big losses on baseball operations but actually love their
cross-ownership of a team and a hugely valuable regional cable-TV
network for which the club is the anchor tenant.</TE>
<TE>   The new twist in this negotiation is that the players are on no
higher ground than the owners. After all, in these revenue-sharing
plans, it isn't the players' money that's under consideration. The
owners are begging that, for the financial health and competitive
balance of their game, they be able to share more of their revenues
among themselves -- as NFL teams have done so successfully.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the owners used to have the right to make those
decisions unilaterally. But they didn't understand what a great idea
revenue sharing was--even though the late Orioles owner Edward
Bennett Williams, and plenty of others, told them so for many years.
It would level the economic playing field. It would keep player
salaries from reaching escape velocity and rocketing off into outer
space. But, no-o-o-o-o, they wouldn't listen.</TE>
<TE>   Then, during the 1994 strike, the owners bargained away some of
their rights to control their own revenues. They let the players
under the tent, to a degree. One current executive holds his head and
says, ''We've done dumb things, but that was unbelievable.''</TE>
<TE>   As the season gets into full swing, the players in Montreal and
Minnesota, with their careers at risk, may not be the only ones who
face a reality check because of a kind of contraction.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance is "contracting," too.</TE>
<TE>   So far it's a minor issue. Less than a 4 percent drop on a small
enough sampling of games as to be inconclusive.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the louder and longer the players and owners argue over
luxury taxes, revenue sharing and work stoppages, the more the
fans--or soon-to-be ex-fans--will vote with their wallets.</TE>
<TE>   If the union and the owners saw their looming predicament as
clearly as the athletes on the Twins and Expos, then baseball would
have few worries. But they never have. If the stagnant rosters on
both sides don't change, perhaps they never will.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets are expensive and a recession is just ending. If baseball
doesn't fix its festering labor mess without the usual melodrama and
work stoppage, then a "contraction" far worse than killing a couple
of teams will occur. Attendance, revenue and TV ratings will shrivel.
As well as a whole generation's love for the game.</TE>

<HD>Martinez Thankful for Every Game</HD>
<DH>Pro baseball: Red Sox pitcher has a new perspective, living
with the knowledge that he's one injury from making his final
appearance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BOSWELL</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Every game, every inning, every single pitch is now precious to Pedro
Martinez. Because, even though he is only 30-years-old, he doesn't
know how many more he has left. Every day he wakes, wondering about
the state of his right shoulder. After all, Sandy Koufax quit at 30.
The brightest flames sometimes burn out first.</LD>
<LD>   So, Thursday at Camden Yards was incredibly delicious for
Martinez. Five days before, he pitched eight shutout innings,
allowing only one hit--the first sign in a year that the old Pedro
might return to us. Now, he's done it again with seven one-hit
innings to beat the Orioles, 7-0. This time Pedro did it with
flourish--10 strikeouts and a no-hitter in progress for 52/3 innings.</LD>
<LD>   "This is still a year to wonder ... I don't trust myself. It is
inning to inning," said Martinez who was disabled twice last season
and did not win a game from last May 30 until early this month.
"Every day is a new adventure. I am still in 'wonder'-land."</LD>
<TE>   Baseball has no more precious pitcher and person than Pedro--nor
one more precariously perched at the very top of the sport. He has
the strikeout stuff and stifling presence of Randy Johnson, yet is
almost a foot shorter. He has the every-man physique of Greg Maddux,
as well as the same touch, craft and acumen, yet he throws almost 10
mph faster.</TE>
<TE>   No other pitcher approaches his combination of qualities, his
variety of attack. Perhaps none ever has. He is the slim deceiver one
moment, then the intimidator, even the knockdown menace, the next. He
torments hitters like a picador with sliders and change-ups, then
finishes them off like a matador with blazing heat or a curve as
sharp as any in the game. With his best stuff, he can humiliate whole
teams. On his worst days, he can still drive them crazy with cunning
and win anyway with next to nothing.</TE>
<TE>   That's why, every time he takes the mound this season, the whole
baseball world, not just the fatalistic Red Sox Nation, goes to the
hill with him. He is irreplaceable, infectious, adorable. And living
on the edge.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to be patient with myself unless I want to risk my
career," he said, adding that he would have left the game when he
reached his pitch-count limit, even with a no-hitter in progress.
"This is actually fear. My career was this far from being over."</TE>
<TE>   And he holds his fingers a couple of inches apart. This distance
is metaphorical, not physiological. His problem is tendinitis, and
the cure is rest, though all sore shoulders make doctors think
"rotator cuff."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Martinez threw "one pitch to that kid in Tampa Bay,
and I knew it was bad. I couldn't stop the pain. I couldn't even
shower. Now I appreciate every single pitch I make."</TE>
<TE>   The Orioles are hardly a challenge for any pitcher, especially a
great one. They could take batting practice in a hotel lobby without
breaking the lamps. Still, Martinez's rising fastball hit 95 mph, his
sinking and tailing fastballs were only a mile or two slower and all
his off-speed pitches were so precise it seemed unethical.</TE>
<TE>   'That's twice we've heard (from scouts) that he doesn't have the
same (stuff) he used to," Orioles Manager Mike Hargrove said. "I've
yet to see (evidence of) it. ... He had command of all his pitches
anywhere in the count. Just nasty curves and sliders. He can make
Babe Ruth look like Baby Ruth."</TE>
<TE>   The only change-up all day that didn't dive below the knees was
the one that Gary Matthews Jr. lined into right field for a clean
single. The Red Sox are in first place but have no hope of staying
there unless Pedro has a season like his first three in Boston-19-7,
23-4, 18-6--not last year's 7-3.</TE>
<TE>   "Five or 10 starts won't dictate how I finish the season,"
Martinez said, "and that is what matters."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Red Sox can hope, such as hope is in New England. "I
like what I see," Manager Grady Little said. "If there are any
doubters, he killed off those few."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball needs Martinez not just for his pitching, but his
personality. "On days when I'm not pitching, I'm a jumpy, happy guy,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   But he's also a prickly one and a theatrical one. This month, he
passed Randy Johnson as the pitcher who reached 2,000 career
strikeouts in the fewest innings (1,711). So, the Big Unit, as well
as Koufax, Walter Johnson and Bob Feller, can step back.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez used the moment to jab former Dodgers manager Tommy
Lasorda who favored trading him (even up for Delino DeShields) in
1993.</TE>
<TE>   "Tommy said I'm only a five-inning pitcher," Martinez said. "Not
bad for a five-inning pitcher."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, who for four years starting in 1997 in Montreal was as
brilliant as any pitcher in history, has no more seasons to waste or
opportunities to pass up. His three Cy Young Awards will never go
away. But, on any pitch, he could be back where he was last spring.</TE>
<TE>   The buzz is that, wonderful as he was Thursday, he's still not and
might never again be quite the whole Pedro package. Who knows how
many days are left for special occasions, for no-hitters?</TE>
<TE>   "Tell the president he owes me a visit to the White House,"
Martinez says.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to win the World Series to get invited to the White
House," says a Boston writer.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox haven't won a Series since 1918. Martinez recoils at
the reminder, as if a black cat just walked under a ladder.</TE>
<TE>   He reconsiders, but doesn't change his mind. The President used to

<HD>Earnhardt's Racing Team Has More Mature Look</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE SPENCER</AU>
<BD>SPORTING NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the track announcer calls Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s name, the
aluminum stands at Martinsville shake as if a small earthquake is
rattling through the concrete that anchors them.</LD>
<LD>   There is no doubting the connection he shares with fans. Like his
father before him, Earnhardt is Everyman--blue-collar laborer,
farmer, businessman, hero. As he stands on pit road before a race, he
definitely can feel the love, a bonding that has deepened over the
last year.</LD>
<LD>   "I have fun with the fans, and I think they enjoy it," Earnhardt
says. "We have a great friendship."</LD>
<TE>   But the scene could have been completely different had Earnhardt,
27, not accepted the responsibility thrust upon him after his
father's death on the final lap of the 2001 Daytona 500. If Junior
had become reclusive in the months that followed, his fans would have
understood.</TE>
<TE>   His every move drew intense scrutiny from the media and his
compatriots and competitors in the Winston Cup garage. But he handled
each challenge adroitly, whether on the track or in the boardroom of
the motorsports empire his father built.</TE>
<TE>   "After February 19, Junior was put under a microscope, and he rose
to the occasion like an Earnhardt," says Steve Crisp, who has worked
with father and son at Dale Earnhardt Inc. during the last decade. "I
always loved the kid like a pesky little brother, but now I respect
him for the man that he's become. He's the 21st century version of
his dad."</TE>
<TE>   Junior also happens to be Chevrolet's strongest horse for the
future. For the present, too, for that matter. He got Chevrolet's
first win of the season last Sunday at Talladega. Two years ago, the
direction for Earnhardt's career wasn't so clear. After winning
successive titles in the Busch Series, Junior's team expected the
same results in Winston Cup. When they didn't come, finger-pointing
began.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Winston Cup crew member Jeff Clark joined the No. 8 team
after the move from the Busch Series. Clark thinks the confidence the
core team brought from the two championships gave its members the
impression that "they would come to Cup like gangbusters."</TE>
<TE>   "They were going to take this series by surprise," Clark says.
"'They were going to break all of Jeff Gordon's records, break all of
Tony Stewart's records. They had the capability to win every week,
but the consistency wasn't there.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be aware of the big picture. You can't let your
emotions get the best of you and boil back over into the crew."</TE>
<TE>   Although Earnhardt and his crew won two races, the team and the
organization expected stronger results. Losing the rookie title to
Matt Kenseth was a significant wake-up call. Losing the leader of
team owner DEI three months later was the impetus to turn the program
around.</TE>
<TE>   The team finished 16th in points in Junior's rookie year and rose
to eighth last year, with three wins and 15 top 10s. But that wasn't
good enough. The team had to regain its cohesiveness.</TE>
<TE>   "My guys and I have a little more dedication to each other and to
making our cars work better," Earnhardt says. "There's more to a
successful team than building a good racecar. Things like getting two
personalities to jell nicely and not be conflicting all the time is
real important."</TE>
<TE>   According to those at DEI, Junior's attitude has improved
dramatically over last year. Once some personnel issues were
addressed and the finger-pointing ceased, the team could analyze its
weaknesses on the track. Junior was excelling on the superspeedways,
but his short-track and road-course performances were falling short.</TE>
<TE>   Road-course questions won't be answered until June, but the
improvements he has made at Bristol and Martinsville and even at
Darlington, a smaller, difficult track, have been impressive. He has
led 222 laps in short-track competition and had career-high finishes
at Darlington, Bristol and Martinsville.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Charpentier, DEI's engineering manager, says the team has
learned to use all of the resources that an organization of its size
has to offer, especially when it comes to testing. "We're constantly
adding people and state-of-the-art equipment to offer the teams the
latest technology possible," Charpentier says.</TE>
<TE>   Earnhardt says testing and additional experience on the short
tracks have been beneficial to the team.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to the track with better-handling cars, at least
most of the tracks," Earnhardt says. "Performance turns into
confidence. I haven't changed much about my driving style, but I
haven't tried to overdrive the car so much. I was doing that a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, Junior is casting aside his bad habits, on the track and
off. Before the season, he said he wanted to prove to his critics
that "there's more to me professionally than just magazine covers ...
and fun times."</TE>
<TE>   And like his father and grandfather, Ralph, this Earnhardt won't
be satisfied until he wins the title.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to win championships," Junior says. "There's something to
be said about having that asterisk beside your name for the rest of
your life and the rest of the time in the books that says you were
champion sometime in your life."</TE>

<HD>Travelers to Europe Must Beat an Uncertain Path</HD>
<DH>Even experts can't say for sure how the Continent is
shaping up for rates, availability. A suggestion: Buy plane tickets
soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fly to Italy. Drive around England. Cruise the Greek Isles.</LD>
<LD>   Book now. Book later. Or don't book at all.</LD>
<LD>   Don't feel bad if you can't figure out what to do. It's tough to
plan travel to Europe this summer when even experts can't figure out
whether air fares are going up or down, tours will proceed as planned
or cruise ship fares or hotel rates will increase. If you think such
uncertainty is normal this time of year, think again. This is shaping
up to be a summer on the Continent like no other.</LD>
<TE>   The traditional bus tour, for instance, which more risk-averse
tourists tend to favor, is turning into a nail-biter. For the first
time in his 30 years of organizing trips, Jimmy Murphy, president of
Chatsworth-based Brendan Tours, says he can't answer this simple
question: "How's business?"</TE>
<TE>   In past years, he could fairly accurately estimate by March 17 how
many tourists he would send to Europe in the summer. By mid-April of
this year, he still wasn't sure, thanks partly to travelers booking
at the last minute. "I've never seen anything like it," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Surprised by a late surge in demand, his company, which serves
about 70,000 customers in a typical year, is reopening tours for June
that it canceled just two months ago, he says. (After the Sept. 11
attacks, Brendan pulled about 25% of the trips it listed in its
October brochures for 2002.)</TE>
<TE>   At New York-based Trafalgar Tours, an industry giant that counts
its yearly customers "in the six figures" (officials won't give an
exact number), President Gavin Tollman says his clients usually plan
their European vacations about six months in advance. This year it's
about 30 to 45 days ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The lag in bookings is producing some deals on summer tours.
Trafalgar, for instance, has been offering $300 off per couple on
packages that include travel on American Airlines. "I can assure you,
you wouldn't have seen that last year," Tollman says. But it's also
disrupting travelers' plans as tour operators rejigger itineraries
and struggle to secure last-minute airline seats.</TE>
<TE>   As for air fares, fasten your seat belts; it's going to be bumpy.
It looks as though fewer Americans will be traveling to Europe this
summer than last, which ordinarily would force fares down. But here's
the other shoe: Airlines are scheduling fewer transatlantic flights,
which decreases the supply of seats. So we may not get lower prices
in this peak season after all.</TE>
<TE>   About 12 million Americans went to Europe last year and a record
13 million in 2000, the European Travel Commission reported this
year. Travel commission President Einar Gustavsson is figuring on
about 10% fewer American travelers, or about 10.8 million, this year.
"It's not going to be a banner year for sure, but it's going to be a
fairly good year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, several European airlines have announced plans to cut
transatlantic flights by more than 10% from last year: 14% for Air
France, 17% for Virgin Atlantic and 30% for Alitalia, according to
the ETC. Although British Airways and some American carriers are
adding flights, it's unclear whether that will be enough to meet
demand, Gustavsson says.</TE>
<TE>   Some Americans are already having trouble getting the flights and
fares they want.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't find anything to London for the last three to four days
of the spring fare," says Brian Clewer, owner of Continental Travel
Shop, a Santa Monica-based air fare consolidator, referring to the
traditional June 15 cutoff before peak-season fares kick in. Overall,
he says summer fares are a bit higher this year than last. He has
been able to offer discounted LAX-to-London nonstops for $699 round
trip this year, compared with about $649 last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Although airlines extended deadlines on some sales to Europe past
May 31, as of April 17 they were still enforcing higher summer fares,
adding $200 to $300 more for flights after June 15, says Harriet
Roop, a manager at Sundial Travel in Fountain Valley and president of
the Orange County chapter of the American Society of Travel Agents.
Peak-season round-trip fares to Europe from the Los Angeles area were
running about $1,000 to $1,300, she says.</TE>
<TE>   By the time this column is published, there could be a late sale
on summer air fares--highly unusual, but possible if airlines get
caught with unsold seats, travel agents say.</TE>
<TE>   Buy now? Buy later? "It's kind of like Russian roulette," Roop
says. But agents say that if you need to fly on a specific date, book
far ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Once in Europe, you may or may not find hotel deals. Through
February (the latest statistics available), room rates were down an
average of 12.5% in London, 9.6% in Rome and 6.4% in Madrid from last
year, Smith Travel Research reports. But you'll have to compete for
space with the locals, who didn't stop traveling. Stung by the swift
drop in U.S. tourists since Sept. 11, hotels have adapted by pitching
more heavily to Europeans. As a result, rooms are being snapped up by
Europeans who buy discounted packages advertised locally, tour
operator Murphy says.</TE>
<TE>   As for cruises, much depends on where you want to go and how. The
renewed Israeli-Palestinian conflict is making some Americans,
especially occasional vacationers, avoid not just the Mideast but
also Greece and Turkey. Agents and others report quiet last-minute
discounts on some Eastern Mediterranean cruises. By contrast,
Scandinavian and river cruises are popular and less likely to be
discounted, they say. In any event, don't rely on cruise brochures
issued last year for 2002 because many lines redeployed ships after
Sept. 11; even brochures issued this year may be outdated in this
shifting market. Ask your travel agent for the latest information.</TE>
<TE>   Safety and control, actual or perceived, seem to be big factors in
where Americans are going this summer. Britain, Ireland, Norway and
Italy are popular, agents and tour operators say; Turkey and to some
extent Greece are less so. Fewer people are taking escorted tours,
possibly because those vacationers are more reluctant to travel
because of security hassles and other difficulties, Murphy says. By
contrast, he has seen a surge of interest in fly-drive trips to the
British Isles and in independent travel.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the uncertainty, this could be a uniquely good summer for
Americans to visit the Continent. With the introduction earlier this
year of the euro in 12 Western European countries, we no longer have
to juggle moneys as we cross borders. The dollar continues to gain on
the new currency, buying about 1.13 euros, which gives us more
purchasing power. And with fewer of our countrymen there, we may
actually be able to see the Mona Lisa without having to crane our
necks in the Louvre.</TE>

<HD>Denmark, but Different</HD>
<DH>Pristine, arty Bornholm Island, popular with Nordic
vacationers, is little known to Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DALE M. BROWN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BORNHOLM, Denmark</DL>
<LD>On a recent trip to this country of warm welcomes, I had barely
unpacked in Copenhagen when a young Danish friend, Frank
Engelbrecht-Jensen, called to greet me in one breath and ask me in
the next whether I would like to join him on a three-day,
head-clearing trip to Bornholm. Denmark is always a homecoming for
me--I was a student here many years ago--and this small Baltic island
just happens to be one of my favorite spots. Naturally, I leaped at
the invitation.</LD>
<LD>   All but unknown to Americans, Bornholm is a kind of Danish
Martha's Vineyard and one of Scandinavia's better-kept secrets.
Danes, Swedes, Norwegians and Germans, who recognize a good thing
when they see it, vacation on the island during the long days of the
Scandinavian summer. And 70% of them are repeaters.</LD>
<TE>   As I knew from experience, Bornholm has something to offer people
of all ages and inclinations. Accommodations range from seaside
hotels and house and apartment rentals to woodsy campgrounds.
Swimmers and sunbathers love the island's wide beaches, whose
sugar-white sand is so fine it was once exported for use in
hourglasses. Rock climbers are drawn to its granite cliffs. Golfers
flock to its three 18-hole courses, yachters to its harbors. Bikers
and hikers find hours of pleasure following its numerous paths and
roads. And for people who just want to relax, there are charming
towns, like Svaneke and Gudhjem (which means "God's Home"), whose
red, yellow, green, blue and white half-timbered houses crowd down
slopes to the water's edge.</TE>
<TE>   I hadn't been to the island in decades. Until recently you could
reach it only by airplane or overnight ferry. Now you can drive most
of the way from Copenhagen. The sleek new Oresund Bridge joining
Denmark and Sweden helps make this possible in just three hours,
about half of which are spent aboard a comfortable, high-speed
catamaran car ferry from Ystad, in southern Sweden, to the small city
of Ronne, the island's capital. (It's also possible to take a train
or bus from Copenhagen to the ferry and then rent a car.)</TE>
<TE>   Frank and I elected to drive. Setting out one afternoon last
October, we arrived in the dark at our hotel, the modern, three-story
Radisson SAS Fredensborg, set among trees on the outskirts of Ronne.
I was particularly eager to see how the growing numbers of tourists
were affecting Bornholm, even in a country that I always find
delightfully unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   One of the surprises awaiting me early the next day was the view
as I opened the curtains of my room: a sparkling blue sea, seen
through a screen of bright green pine trees. The pristine nature of
it all made me want to get going right away.</TE>
<TE>   Bornholm is 227 square miles, home to about 44,000 people, but not
so big that it can't be driven around in a couple of hours. It lies
between Sweden and Poland, about 110 miles from Copenhagen as the sea
gull flies, and is rocky at its northern end (two-thirds of the
island is granite), where purple heather blooms in August and
September. To the south, the landscape becomes gently rolling,
fertile farmland punctuated by 13 tall windmills and several smaller
ones.</TE>
<TE>   Frank and I made our first stop in the north, near Hasle, to visit
herring smokehouses a stone's throw from the sea. As an avid amateur
photographer, I wanted to take advantage of the crystalline morning
light to shoot these beautiful structures, whose broad, walk-in
fireplaces take a pyramidal shape on the outside, then narrow into
tall chimneys. Found all along the coast, the smokehouses are
distinctive to the island, which was long dependent on its fishing
industry as a major revenue source.</TE>
<TE>   The process by which the silver herring are smoked is an ancient
one. They are gutted and strung on racks to dry in the open air, then
placed over smoldering alder wood and left in the fireplaces until
they turn gold. Such is their reputation as a delicacy that they are
known throughout Denmark as Bornholmers, the name for the islanders
themselves. Nothing beats eating one still warm from the smokehouse.
Unfortunately, Frank and I arrived after the previous day's catch had
already been packed for shipment. Only the delicious aroma of herring
and smoke lingered in the air.</TE>
<TE>   We paused next at a wild spot called Jons Kapel ("John's Chapel"),
a 72-foot-deep split in billion-year-old granite. One of several such
ravines along the coast, it was named after a medieval hermit and
missionary who, legends says, lived here in a cave. A couple of
hundred wooden steps descend to the boulder-and-seaweed-strewn shore
below. Standing on a rock at the bottom, I was reminded of the
elemental forces that have shaped Bornholm over the eons, including
the grinding together of continental plates that gave birth to it in
a violent upthrust.</TE>
<TE>   From Jons Kapel it was a short drive to the seaside hamlet of
Vang, once a center of Bornholm's granite industry, commemorated in a
small park where pieces of the hewn stone have been arranged like
sculptures. In the upper part of town we had an outdoor lunch at La
Port, one of many restaurants that have sprung up to accommodate
summer visitors.</TE>
<TE>   On our way to its terrace, I couldn't help but notice that though
it was midday and the sun was shining brightly, candles burned on
every table. Surely the Danes, in their avid pursuit of hygge, their
word for coziness, use more candles per capita than any other people
on earth. And what did lunch consist of? Herring, of course--smoked
and pickled, served with capers, red onion rings and tufts of
feathery dill--accompanied by beet and cucumber salads and buttered
slices of dark Danish rye. It was a meal of utter freshness, washed
down with beer and ice-cold aquavit.</TE>
<TE>   Thus fortified, we continued to Gudhjem. When I saw it last, it
was a fishing village, home to a few artists; now it is a booming
resort town. I'm happy to report that it has not lost its mellowness,
despite an occasional eyesore, like the sign I saw on the side of a
new building for El Puppo--a Mexican restaurant! And in an
overzealous effort to make room for cars down by the harbor, the
authorities had asphalted over a portion of the rocky shore; plans
are now afoot to remove the unsightly covering and restore the
boulders to their natural state.</TE>
<TE>   In the shops and galleries along the crooked streets, I found
plenty of evidence of how far Bornholm has come as a center of
creative activity. About 150 craftsmen now have studios on the
island, many of them in Gudhjem and nearby Svaneke. The examples I
saw were the work of talented professionals. Bornholm also boasts
what many consider to be Europe's best glass and ceramics school, at
Nekso. Though applications flood in from everywhere, it accepts only
12 students a year.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most famous of the island's artists, the late Oluf
Host, has been honored in his native Gudhjem by having his home and
studio turned into a museum, which Frank and I made a point of
visiting. Host loved Bornholm and painted it often, but came back
again and again to the courtyard of the farm he owned, rendering the
barn in different lights and moods, much the way Claude Monet focused
on haystacks for some of his most beautiful paintings. Host's works
have a strange power, and I was glad to have discovered him.</TE>
<TE>   Next to Gudhjem is the fishing village of Melsted, the location of
a 300-year-old farm. The Bornholm countryside is scattered with
similar places: half-timbered, brightly colored houses built around
cobbled courtyards. This one is canary yellow, and its thatch roof
bears patches of fresh moss. Although the house and adjacent
outbuildings function as a museum, they have been maintained as if a
family were still living there--with animals in the stalls and pens,
geraniums on the windowsills, and cats lolling on the plump feather
comforters of the alcove beds. I loved it for being so hygge.</TE>
<TE>   Down the road from the farm is an outfit with a big name in the
Danish crafts world--Baltic Sea Glass. It was founded by a young
couple, Pete Hunner, an American, and Maibritt Jonsson, a Swede. In
the 20 years that they have lived and worked on the island they have
built their company into a highly successful venture, with customers
for their handblown glass scattered all over the world.</TE>
<TE>   Pete took us around the showroom and studio, explaining that he
and Maibritt take much of their inspiration from nature. And no
wonder: Outside their building a meadow dips to the rocky beach where
the coastline stretches as far as the eye can see. Their pieces speak
of water and sky, of wind, grass and stone.</TE>
<TE>   It would have been enjoyable to linger at the Hunners', but we
wanted to be sure to see Bornholm's new art museum, devoted to the
works of local painters and craftsmen. Erected on a grassy slope, the
building has already acquired recognition for its originality. The
architects, Johan Fogh and Per Folner, seem to have taken their
inspiration from the island's ravines. You enter at the highest level
and are drawn into an angular white space that splits the museum into
two parts, lighted from above by skylights. Then you go down. Long
flights of stairs clinging to one wall descend to ground level. Off
each landing are the galleries, intimate rooms with paintings dating
from the 19th century to the present.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's most memorable feature is the sacred spring that runs
through it. In the Middle Ages people came to drink or bathe in its
waters in search of miraculous cures. Now, dramatically lighted, it
wells up into the museum entryway and flows through a narrow channel
that cuts through the entire structure before exiting the building
and splashing down to the Baltic. A long elevated walkway leads from
the lowest story to a gazebo, where in the country silence visitors
can reflect on the art they've seen and admire the sweeping views of
forest and coast.</TE>
<TE>   The island's pure air all but guarantees a perfect night's sleep,
and the next morning I was up early again, ready for another day of
touring. At the top of our list were the island's four round,
whitewashed churches, crowned with black-shingled, conical roofs.
This unique form of religious architecture dates to the Middle Ages,
when pirates frequently raided the island. The safest place for the
inhabitants to shelter was inside, secure behind sturdy walls that
enabled these handsome buildings to be both places of worship and
fortresses.</TE>
<TE>   The 13th century church at Osterlars is particularly fine, its
exterior dominated by thick buttresses. The interior features a
marvelous medieval painting of Judgment Day that runs in a continuous
band around the circular core. The work tells its story in time-muted
colors, with the saved ascending to heaven and the damned being
shunted off to hell by demons. I could imagine frightened islanders
huddled within the church, not knowing whether they would live or
die, and constantly reminded of destiny.</TE>
<TE>   Like the other three round churches, Osterlars stands in open
country, and the drive to any one of them provides lovely views of
the island's historic landscape. We passed several ancient burial
mounds and Viking rune stones, or inscribed memorials, which rise
from the earth like hulking figures from the past. The snug
half-timbered farmhouses we saw everywhere spoke of the cozy
domesticity that settled over Bornholm once the pirate threat ended,
a peacefulness that persists today.</TE>
<TE>   Having been surrounded by history, we thought it made sense to go
deeper still, into Bornholm's prehistory. It's now a real possibility
thanks to the state-of-the-art nature center, NaturBornholm, which
opened last year. Like the art museum, it sits alone in a field and
is split down the middle by a broad corridor, illuminated by sunshine
streaming through windows and skylights. A visit to the center is
intended as a journey that starts with Bornholm's birth and winds up
with an examination of the island's flora and fauna. The imaginative
displays cover the billion years of the island's existence, with
bronze markers in the floor of each room identifying the geological
period represented by stones, fossils and other items. Children loved
the hands-on exhibits, and I was taken with the thoughtful, often
amusing way in which the displays rendered difficult concepts simple.</TE>
<TE>   For yet a closer look at Bornholm's geology and history, we drove
on to Hammershus, a red-brick and stone fortress that occupies a
granite promontory above the sea near the northern tip of the island.
Indeed, there is no higher point in all of flat Denmark.</TE>
<TE>   To reach this aerie, we hiked up a stony roadway to the gate and
entered what remained of the enormous interior and courtyard,
carpeted today with thick grass. At the center rises a large, square,
roofless tower. The advent of artillery and bombardments from the sea
rendered the castle useless as a fortress. It became a prison and
home to a garrison instead. So much time has elapsed since Hammers-
hus fell into disrepair that its ruins today seem an entirely natural
part of the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   The afternoon was growing short, and I wanted to see Svaneke, a
village not far from Gudhjem. I had heard its beauty is unblemished
thanks to strict architectural controls. I was not disappointed. Even
more than Gudhjem, it looks as it did in the 19th century. Yet for
all the care taken to keep its antique atmosphere intact, it is not a
museum town but a living place of small, multi-windowed houses.
Thirsty, we entered the local brew house and had a creamy brown beer.
By the time we drained our tall glasses, dusk had fallen and the
narrow streets were empty. But I felt none of the loneliness of a
place shut down for the night. That's because we could see through
the windowpanes into the lighted rooms, whose hyggelig atmosphere
seemed almost an invitation for us to come in for a cup of coffee and
a good chat.</TE>
<TE>   Instead we had dinner at an old hotel by the harbor, the Siemsens
Gaard, housed in a 400-year-old half-timbered building that was once
the home of a rich merchant.</TE>
<TE>   Before leaving for Copenhagen the following day, we walked
barefoot in the squeaking sand of Dueodde, at the southern end of the
island. The beach, backed by dunes and forest, was as pristine as any
as I have seen. Brushed by the warmth of the sun, I began dreaming
about returning to the island with my family and sharing its many
pleasures. In summer, the sun shines well into the night before
setting in a splash of colors behind the sea, only to reappear a few
hours later in a blaze of dawn. Even in these troubled times, gentle
Bornholm makes the world and its problems seem far away.</TE>

Florida.</LD>
<LD>   Carnival agreed to five years of court supervision. In a

<KH>Weekend Escape</KH>
<HD>Spring Fever in Tehachapi</HD>
<DH>With or without wildflowers, the high-desert town has
perennial appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN JAMES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>TEHACHAPI, Calif.</DL>
<LD>It was early spring, maybe a little too early for the Mourning Cloak
Ranch and Botanical Gardens.</LD>
<LD>   In late March, the time of my visit, the garden's resplendent
lilacs, madronos, heather, manzanita and crab-apple trees had not
reached their April bloom. The prolific peonies of May were weeks
away from flowering too.</LD>
<LD>   But as I climbed the winding paths, a secret garden began to
emerge: Oregon grape and brilliant clusters of yellow, white and
orange daffodils. A waterfall cascading into a pool, kept company by
a miniature red-leaf maple and statues of two Japanese cranes.</LD>
<TE>   I turned my head and saw a trio of mule deer about 30 feet away.
Or were they statues too? A doe twitched her ears, and the three
departed, daintily picking their way down the hillside.</TE>
<TE>   Sufficient rain can turn the high desert here into a beautiful
carpet of wildflowers, but this winter was dry. So it was with
trepidation that I talked my parents, Royal and Bobbe, into a search
for the elusive blooms.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the flowers didn't matter much anyway. In Tehachapi we
found other pleasing diversions, places such as Mourning Cloak that
turned out to be the seeds of a colorful getaway.</TE>
<TE>   We started out on a Friday, driving on California 14 from Los
Angeles toward Tehachapi, two hours north. Long before we reached the
Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve west of Lancaster, it was
obvious that the brown hills weren't going to yield any breathtaking
displays this year.</TE>
<TE>   Near the reserve headquarters, a few couples wandered around
looking for poppies. Some windblown specimens were on the north
slope, but the most dramatic sight was a diamondback rattlesnake
curled up in a sunny spot under a picnic table.</TE>
<TE>   Five miles farther west is the Arthur B. Ripley Desert Woodland, a
566-acre state park where juniper and Joshua trees flourish on land
once scraped bare for farming. Desert flora loomed ahead like some
alien jungle, the strange arms of the Joshua trees twisting every
which way. But like the poppy reserve, this park had scant
wildflowers. (For information on either park, go to cal-parks.ca.gov
and click on "Find A Park.")</TE>
<TE>   By midafternoon we reached Tehachapi and continued about 15 miles
southwest of town toward the Resort at Stallion Springs. We zigzagged
through flat fields of young grass, then crossed a covered wooden
bridge and followed the road up the hill to the Stallion Springs
lodge, center of a resort that includes a golf course, riding
stables, a lake for fishing and an Old West Main Street.</TE>
<TE>   The lodge sits high on a rocky precipice overlooking a valley and
the cloud-capped Tehachapi Mountains. California live oaks dot the
hillsides. The setting reminded me of another place I once stayed, a
game lodge in Africa overlooking wild herds roaming a valley below.
No herds roamed here (unless you count the local ostrich farm), and
the buildings needed some paint, but the view was spectacular and the
lodge was a welcoming place with a lighted fireplace in the lobby.</TE>
<TE>   Standard spring and summer rates for a double range from $80 to
$110 per night. Our room for three, with a senior discount about $100
plus tax, was large, comfortable and very, very quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Along the highway into Tehachapi, we had seen signs advertising
Domingo's Mexican &amp; Seafood Restaurant. We decided to give it a try.
Royal was happy with his beef taco combination plate; Mother and I
ordered carnitas tacos and enchiladas rancheras. The pork was
overcooked, but the enchiladas were wonderful, the margaritas were
tasty and we couldn't get enough of the homemade salsa.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday morning was glorious. Spiraling cumulus clouds drifted
over the mountains, and the air was cold and crisp as we set off for
Mourning Cloak Ranch and Botanical Gardens, an old Tehachapi ranch
that Marian and Ed Sampson bought in 1973 and turned into a thriving
showcase of flora and fauna.</TE>
<TE>   The 30-acre property, named for a species of butterfly, is a bird
sanctuary boasting 104 species. More than 2,600 cultivars, including
about 500 native California plants, cover the hillsides around the
main house and outbuildings. The gardens are officially open May
through October, but I had found out by phone that we could take an
early-season self-guided tour for $5 per person. (Reservations are
required; guided tours are also available year-round. Call [661]
822-1661 or go to www.mourning cloakranch.com for details.)</TE>
<TE>   Not counting the deer, we had the gardens all to ourselves.
According to my brochure, the schoolhouse of the long-vanished town
of Williamsburg, founded in 1869, once stood in the oak grove here.
At the foot of a hill, I came across a red and white barn where three
Shetland ponies shared a roomy corral.</TE>
<TE>   We headed into town for lunch, serendipitously driving past the
Apple Shed, a restaurant, bakery and gift shop housed in a
refurbished railroad shed. We got a table by the window and watched
trains pass by while Mother and I enjoyed a spinach salad with a
terrific raspberry vinaigrette, and Royal feasted on homemade chili.
Best of all: homemade peach pie made with local fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Royal is a retired engineer from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, and he was eager to see the Tehachapi railroad loop and the
region's iconic wind farms. The loop, about eight miles west of town,
is still considered one of the great engineering feats of the 19th
century Old West: switchbacking railroad tracks that rise slowly
inside one tunnel known simply as No. 9. The project, completed in
1876, bridges the elevation difference between Central and Southern
California rail lines without ever exceeding a grade of 2.2%. When
the engine of a 4,000-foot-long train emerges from the top of the
tunnel, it is 77 feet above its caboose at the bottom.</TE>
<TE>   As if this sight wasn't compelling enough, I peered at the tracks
in the valley below and noticed purple lupine and small yellow
blossoms on narrow silver stalks. Aha, I thought: wildflowers!</TE>
<TE>   We drove southwest of Tehachapi to the phalanxes of tall white
windmills marching across the hills. This is the Tehachapi-Mojave
Wind Resource Area, where nearly 5,000 turbines harvest the gusts
that blow regularly around here. The facility generates about 2
billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, one official said,
enough to power far more than a million homes.</TE>
<TE>   Weekday tours can be arranged with either Michael Burns of Oak
Creek Energy Systems, (661) 822-6853, www.oakcreekenergy.com, or
Linda White of the Kern Wind Energy Assn., (661) 831-1038. No tours
are given on weekends, although the Greater Tehachapi Chamber of
Commerce, (661) 822-4180 and www.tehachapi.com, offers a map for a
self-guided tour.</TE>
<TE>   Our last stop of the day was Chaps, Stallion Springs' warm,
wood-paneled restaurant with fine views. Dinner--excellent steak and
medallions of pork--was as pleasing as the setting.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, great slabs of gray clouds were sandwiched between
earth and sky. Rain poured down. I made one last stab at my original
mission. "Where are the wildflowers?" I asked the receptionist at the
lodge.</TE>
<TE>   She pointed up at the heavens. "They're right there."</TE>

<LD>A friend recently purchased an airline ticket on a major carrier for
a mid-May departure from New York to London for $385. Despite claims
of a comeback in transatlantic travel, such offers suggest that the
European travel market remains slightly depressed, with passenger
numbers running about 10% below 2001 figures for the same period.</LD>
<LD>   When you also consider that the U.S. dollar is trading strong
against the Continent's euro (one euro costs about 89 cents), you
might agree that 2002 is the time to go.</LD>
<LD>   Short trips in May are a particular bargain this year (they
haven't always been), starting as low as $125 a day, including air
fare from the West Coast. That's the per-person price from Internet
tour company Go-Today, (425) 487-9632, www.go-today.com, and from
Gate 1 Travel, (800) 682-3333, www.gate1travel.com. Through May, both
are offering six nights in either London or Paris and round-trip air
fare from New York or Boston for $599 plus tax. Air fare add-ons from
Los Angeles range from $150 to $200 per person.</LD>
<TE>   This year, some vacationers will undertake their European tours by
cruise ship, stopping at city harbors along the North Sea or
Mediterranean coast. Royal Caribbean's giant Splendour of the Seas, a
swank, late-'90s vessel, will be sailing round trips this May from
Barcelona, Spain, at reduced per-person rates from such discounters
as Cruise Direct, (888) 407-2784, which is pricing its May 5 sailing
as low as $767 per person, including port charges but not round-trip
air fare to Barcelona. Sailings later in May will range from $899 to
$1,044 per person. In an active week, the Splendour will dock in
Villefranche (for Nice, France), Livorno (for Pisa or Naples, Italy),
Civitavecchia (for Rome), Naples and Malta before returning to its
home port in Spain.</TE>
<TE>   You also can tour Europe on its inland waterways; large swatches
of the Continent are connected by canals in use since the Middle
Ages. Though most of the barge lines on these routes are upscale and
costly, a smaller firm called 4Winds Tours, (509) 967-3448 or
www.4windstours.com, is building its reputation with sailings on
which the amenities and prices are modest. The company offers many
sailings through Holland and Belgium on cozy, simple vessels sleeping
no more than 20. Activities vary by departure, but on many trips the
participants drawn to this type of boat spend their days biking from
fortified medieval town to town, meeting up with the barge at night
for meals. Because this is the year for the renowned Floriade (the
world's foremost flower show, held every 10 years in Holland),
several canal trips include it.</TE>
<TE>   Among the many products of 4Winds Tours is an eight-day Southern
Holland route (Amsterdam, Utrecht, Delft, Leiden, Haarlem, Amsterdam)
for $670. As with most of the company's offers, a rental bike is
included, as are all meals (bikers put together a sack lunch at
breakfast), private bath and the services of a multilingual guide.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, for travelers touring Europe by train, several recent
price concessions make a springtime trip attractive. Best among them
is Eurail's 40% off sale for its popular "Selectpass Drive" program,
which, for as little as $162 per person, allows you to travel by
train for three days anywhere between three adjoining countries and
to enjoy unlimited mileage in a compact car for two more days.
Purchase by May 31. The same pass also allows access to certain
ferries and entitles the bearer to discounts on the Eurostar train,
which connects Britain with the Continent via the Channel tunnel. For
more information, call Rail Europe at (877) 257-2887.</TE>

<HD>Nothing to Whine About in Burgundy</HD>
<DH>Family-friendly fun is surprisingly easy to find in this
oenophile's paradise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SHAW</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VESVRES-SOUS-PRANGEY, France</DL>
<LD>It was, without question, the most bizarre miniature golf course any
of us had ever seen--tiny, rundown, seemingly abandoned, tucked away
off a small dead-end country road in northern Burgundy.</LD>
<LD>   But the credit card-size leisure "passes" that were available at
tourist sites in and around the nearby 15th century walled town of
Langres listed "le mini-golf" in precisely this spot, and if we
looked carefully, we could see a crude, hand-drawn map posted on an
exterior stone wall, guiding us back to a private home in an
adjacent, unnamed village where, presumably, we could pick up golf
balls, clubs and a scorecard.</LD>
<LD>   Sure enough, we followed the directions and--voila--there was a
pleasant woman sitting in her garage at the prescribed address, happy
to dig out the requisite equipment and collect 30 francs--about
$4.50--for the three of us, my wife, Lucy Stille; our
then-11-year-old son, Lucas; and me.</LD>
<TE>   We returned to the golf course, certain from our earlier, cursory
examination that on so small a course, with no one else playing, we
would finish in 30 minutes, with all of us well under par.</TE>
<TE>   Ha!</TE>
<TE>   Every hole turned out to have impossible obstacles. A brick wall
right in front of one tee. Several wood-and-metal barriers in the
first six feet, one after another. A mock overturned milk container
and a huge piece of plastic "cheese" in the middle of a putting
green. To get around the barriers, we had to hit the ball off the
course--a one-stroke penalty--on at least half the holes. It was all
so daunting that we spent more time giggling than hitting the ball.</TE>
<TE>   On miniature golf courses at home, I usually wind up within two or
three strokes of the typical par of 54; Lucy and Lucas are slightly
higher. Par on this course was also 54. My score: 89. Lucy and Lucas
were over 100. But the course was right next to a canal, so between
errant strokes, missed putts and raucous laughter, we yelled
greetings to French families floating by on their barges. The
experience wound up being one of the highlights of the delightful
week we spent in Burgundy last summer.</TE>
<TE>   I tend to plan my vacations around restaurants, so I've always
liked Burgundy--home of some of the world's finest food and
wines--but the region can also be great fun for kids, as our
excursion to le mini-golf  helped prove. Indeed, the main reason we
rented a house in this location was that it offered a little bit of
everything for everyone--not just good food and wine but sightseeing,
relaxation, beautiful scenery and outdoor activities.</TE>
<TE>   The house, which we had rented on the Internet, was about 20
minutes from the golf course. It had three bedrooms, a modern
kitchen, large dining and living rooms and a huge frontyard filled
with fruit trees, rosebushes and other plants I couldn't begin to
identify. It also had several fireplaces and a good selection of
English-language videos--none of which we initially expected to use.
After all, this was Burgundy in late July. Who would want a fire? And
who goes to France to sit around watching American movies?</TE>
<TE>   Guess again.</TE>
<TE>   It was unseasonably chilly that week, and it rained a little
almost every day--although, fortunately, almost all the rain fell
while we were driving, eating or sleeping. More important, since we
were on vacation we didn't have to get up early, so we could stay up
late.</TE>
<TE>   On three of our seven nights in the house, we lighted fires and
had our own classic film festival. We saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman
Holiday" after dinner at a casual nearby restaurant overlooking a
beautiful lake. We saw Ingrid Bergman in "Indiscreet" over a simple
supper of bread, cheese, wine and fresh fruit on a day when we had
driven two hours each way for a spectacular three-hour lunch at the
Michelin three-star La Cote d'Or in Saulieu. We saw James Stewart in
"Rear Window" over a dinner that Lucy cooked after a visit to the
market in Dijon, the capital of Burgundy, about 35 minutes south of
our house.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, we had gone to Dijon on the wrong day--Monday,
when the main open-air market was closed. We had a pleasant time
there anyway--walking through the fine arts museum, which was once a
ducal palace; coming upon an impromptu choral performance; admiring a
13th century Gothic church and lunching in the simple Bistro des
Halles, across from the site of the market.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the market closed, we were able to buy elsewhere fresh
fruits and vegetables and most of the other components of the dinner
we planned to have at home that night--including a strawberry cake
that turned out to be one of the best desserts of the trip.</TE>
<TE>   But as we left Dijon, Lucas said, "What kind of dinner will this
be? We don't have a main course."</TE>
<TE>   "Not to worry," I said, with more confidence than I felt. "Instead
of taking the freeway back, we'll take the N74; it's the main road
that runs through Burgundy. I'm sure we'll find plenty of places open
with good things available."</TE>
<TE>   Lucas teased me every five minutes thereafter as we whizzed
through countryside that was as lovely as it was uncluttered--nary a
commercial, comestible or agricultural venture in sight. Then, about
10 minutes from home, we spotted a farm with a sign advertising
freshly killed chickens, ducks and geese. I pulled triumphantly into
the dirt driveway.</TE>
<TE>   The proprietors were out of ducks and geese, but they had
chickens. We took one home. All French chickens seem to taste better
than American chickens, but this one was especially
flavorful--perhaps because there was a hint of vindication in its
seasoning.</TE>
<TE>   The next day was the sunniest and warmest of the week, so we took
advantage of it to visit Lac Villegusien and Lac de la Liez, both
within 20 minutes of our house. At the first Lucas swam while Lucy
and I sat on the grass and read. After a picnic lunch composed mostly
of leftovers from the previous night's dinner, we headed to Lac de la
Liez, where we rented a pedal boat and pedaled our way around the
lake for a blissful hour.</TE>
<TE>   That night we had one of the two big-deal meals we had budgeted
for during the week--at Lameloise in Chagny, where we met friends
from Washington, D.C., and had several Burgundian
specialties--including frogs' legs, snails, pigs' feet with mashed
potatoes, and assorted preparations of pigeon and duck--and one
distinctly non-Burgundian dish, a lobster and mushroom risotto that
may have been the best dish of the night.</TE>
<TE>   Two of our three wines--all Burgundies, of course--were definitely
the best of the trip: a 1998 Chassagne-Montrachet, La Maltroie, from
Bernard Moreau, and a 1985 Volnay, Clos des Ducs, from Marquis
d'Angerville.</TE>
<TE>   Burgundy is home to some of the greatest wines in the world, and
those wines were the perfect prelude to my plans for the next
day--"My Wine Day," as I called it, having promised Lucy that if we
went to Burgundy I would not drag her through vineyard after vineyard
day after day. (Lucas, who thoroughly enjoys the wining and dining
experience--all the more so in France, where they happily let him
taste wines in restaurants and at vineyards--did grumble, "Why can't
we go to more wineries?")</TE>
<TE>   We were going to visit one of my favorite Burgundy producers,
Domaine Dujac, in the morning and, after lunch, drive to Beaune,
gateway to the Cote d'Or, the oenophile's version of a pilgrimage to
Lourdes.</TE>
<TE>   It was drizzling when we made the drive, but even though I had to
strain to see the signs, I still felt my pulse race as we passed the
vineyards and villages known to wine lovers the world
over--Chambolle-Musigny, Morey-St.-Denis, Gevrey-Chambertin, Clos de
Vougeot, Vosne-Romanee. Dujac is behind a stone wall on a tiny side
street in Morey-St.-Denis, marked only by a modest sign. Jacques
Seysses, the proprietor, had arranged for his son Jeremy to give us a
brief tour and tasting, and after we tried barrel samples of half a
dozen of his 2000 wines, Jeremy opened about a dozen bottles of the
'98s and '99s. When he learned that Lucas was born in 1989, he opened
an '89 for all three of us to sip--and he showed Lucas the proper way
to spit out wine when you're just tasting. Then, it being lunchtime,
he recorked the '89 and suggested we take it around the corner to one
of his favorite local restaurants and enjoy it with our meal.</TE>
<TE>   Done.</TE>
<TE>   Next we were off to Beaune, the home of the dukes of Burgundy
until they moved to Dijon in the 14th century. The city is best known
for the annual Hospices de Beaune charity wine auction, which every
November draws a large, invitation-only gathering to the medieval
hospital-cum-museum known as the Hotel-Dieu.</TE>
<TE>   The Hotel-Dieu was founded as a hospital for the poor in 1443 by
Nicolas Rolin, then chancellor to the duke of Burgundy. Used as a
hospital until 1971, the facility was so attractively designed and so
sumptuously decorated--its walls were hung with valuable works of
art--that it came to be known as a "Palace for the Poor."</TE>
<TE>   The building remains a stunning jewel of Burgundian-Flemish
architecture, perhaps most noticeable in the steeply pitched slate
roof, filled with glazed geometric patterns in gold and red and
black, punctuated by weather vanes, dormer windows and a single
turret topped by a 98-foot spire. The hospital has a large central
courtyard and the massive "Great Hall"--165 feet long, 47 feet wide
and 50 feet high, with an immense vaulted ceiling and 31 hospital
beds in individual wood cubicles. The beds have been preserved as
they were when they held patients--each with a red blanket and a
matching set of red drapes, to be closed for privacy.</TE>
<TE>   To Lucas, the kitchen was the most fascinating room in the
hospital. Realistic-looking dummies of faceless nuns in habits stood
over the stove and chopping blocks, one of which had six whole
chickens arrayed on it. One nun was cutting up a rabbit; another was
poised over a big pot, as if washing dishes.</TE>
<TE>   After examining tapestries and other works of art, we strolled
back out into the gray midsummer day and headed for home.</TE>
<TE>   We had one more sunny day before we had to leave Burgundy, though,
and that was the day we played le mini-golf. We began that splendid
day by walking the ramparts in Langres, ducking into its caves and
towers and sauntering through the town's open-air market. We had
lunch there, sitting on a wood bench while we ate local sausages hot
off the grill, then headed for what Lucas had really been looking
forward to ever since we had found out about it--a go-cart course.</TE>
<TE>   Like the miniature golf, the go-cart course was listed on our
leisure pass, and, like the miniature golf, it was not easy to find.
But once we found it, the man in charge couldn't have been more
helpful--perhaps because we were his only customers.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Lucas nor Lucy nor I had ever been go-carting before, and
Lucy wasn't about to start in rural France. I agreed to race Lucas,
though I had no idea what to expect or how this course might compare
with an American track.</TE>
<TE>   He is not usually a risk-taking kid, so at first I thought he
might be too tentative and go too slowly to have any fun. But he is a
very competitive kid, so then I worried that he would roar off at 60
mph, flip out on a curve and--well, I didn't want to think about it.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, he was neither tentative nor reckless. He drove
fast--much faster than I expected--but he did so safely, slowing at
the turns (of which there were many), then accelerating down the
straightaways. I made sure not to challenge him too aggressively for
fear of triggering his competitive drive in a dangerous fashion.</TE>
<TE>   When we finished, he was beaming. He went fast, he beat me, and
his mom got lots of pictures.</TE>
<TE>   What more could an 11-year-old boy ask for?</TE>

Vesvres, by typing "Burgundy rental" into our favorite search engine,
Google.com. That took us to rentalsfrance.com, among other sites. The
house, owned by a Frenchwoman living in Germany, had all the modern
conveniences we were looking for--including washing machine and
dishwasher--while retaining its 18th century charm. The house, which
can sleep six, has a kitchen, dining room, living room and bathroom
on the main level and three bedrooms and two more bathrooms upstairs.
It is in the countryside about 10 minutes south of Langres and 35
minutes north of Dijon. We paid $1,750, a high-season rate, for a
week.</TE>

<HD>In London, Honoring the Living Remembrances of War</HD>
<DH>Veteran redcoats reside at a stately retirement home in
Chelsea--and like to show it off.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DICK WOODBURY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Have you ever seen a war monument walking? Here, you can find
distinguished reminders of past conflicts strolling along the avenues
of London's West End or window-shopping on Oxford and Regent streets.</LD>
<LD>   Their brilliant scarlet tunics and chests full of medals identify
them as British army veterans, specifically residents of the Royal
Hospital Chelsea. These grizzled career soldiers served their country
in an array of conflicts from World War II to Kenya to the Falklands
and Korea. Now they are living out their sunset years in a museum
piece of a retirement home at the edge of the Thames River.</LD>
<LD>   Britain has a special place in its heart for its old warriors. For
more than 300 years it has billeted them in palatial style, in a
cluster of stately Christopher Wren-designed buildings set on a
manicured lawn and under stately oak trees in luxurious Chelsea. In
this solitude and splendor, 380 veterans enjoy a pampered retirement:
meals in an opulent dining hall, lawn billiards, spacious gardens and
a pub offering $1.50 beer. Officials encourage visitors, though they
discourage overt tourist promotion because, as one explained, "We are
an old fellows' home, not a human zoo."</LD>
<TE>   Buttonhole one of the courtly gents--or better still, steer him
into a pub--and you'll likely be treated to vivid accounts of the
Normandy and Anzio invasions or the 1967 counterinsurgency at Aden.
Their occasional braggadocio is to be expected from the old troopers.
With time on their hands, most are eager to reminisce and to throw in
an opinion or two on modern-day terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Intrigued by the sight of the redcoats amid Chelsea's shoppers, I
followed a couple to the Royal Hospital and was treated to a sliver
of London that few tourists ever see. Behind the black iron gates
lies a period piece of English architecture as majestic as Kensington
Palace, another Wren masterpiece.</TE>
<TE>   Though just three blocks from the trendy boutiques and bistros of
King's Road, the Royal Hospital is a world removed, a time capsule
beckoning visitors to explore.</TE>
<TE>   It lies next to another little-known treasure, the National Army
Museum, a trove of British military memorabilia dating to the Battle
of Agincourt in 1415. The collection of war relics, arms and armor
from the Tudor era and Oliver Cromwell's day (1649 to 1658) and
dramatic battlefield models and paintings comprise a social history
of how soldiers lived, worked and died across the centuries.</TE>
<TE>   The two sites offer a tranquil afternoon's respite from the fast
tempo of the West End. And like many London museums now, both
attractions are free.</TE>
<TE>   "Hospital" is a misnomer for the elegant soldiers' home, which is
largely unchanged from 1682, when it was founded by King Charles II
for "the succor and relief of veterans broken by war." Today's vets
are less broken than they are lonely. Mostly widowers in their 70s,
they have been drawn to Chelsea by the camaraderie and the perks
(including the well-appointed social club, billiards room and
library, bowling green and allotments garden, where the men can show
off their green thumbs). In return for surrendering their army
pensions upon entering, the "in-pensioners," as they are known, are
assured a lifetime of board and lodging, clothing and medical care,
the latter provided by 60 medics, including three doctors.</TE>
<TE>   Wandering through the archways and across the greenswards, I
quickly began to appreciate the enthusiasm of the old soldiers for
their digs. "Best hotel in the world," one octogenarian veteran of
the 1944 battle at Anzio told me as we chatted outside the Great Hall
on a damp fall afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The sense of history and memories of distant battles hung heavy in
the gathering twilight, and it was evident that the same calm and
majesty that appeals to the old vets also captivates visitors. The
trappings of the past greeted me at every turn as my companion led me
into the cavernous hall, where rows of solid oak tables and chairs
define the dining area and where portraits of Charles II, George II
and John, Duke of Marlborough, adorn the walls along with
inscriptions of campaigns dating to Waterloo (1815) and before.</TE>
<TE>   In other rooms, Wren's grand sense of scale and imposing form are
just as evident and inspiring. In the chapel, a giant painting of the
Resurrection, by Sebastiano Ricci, overhangs the apse, and the early
instruments of prayer are enshrined, down to the alms dish, flagons,
chalices and one of the original service books.</TE>
<TE>   A mainstay of the week is the Sunday morning Communion and matins
(visitors are welcome), which is preceded by a small parade of
pensioners on the brilliant green turf of Figure Court. Bounded by
brooding brick buildings on three sides, the court was Wren's
original set piece for the institution; looking south, across the
oaks to the Thames, it is easy to see why this 66-acre property is
among London's most coveted real estate.</TE>
<TE>   The ghost of Charles II was never distant as I ambled across the
grounds, from his stark bronze statue at the center of Figure Court
to the regal memorabilia in the hospital's small but abundant museum.</TE>
<TE>   What really brought my visit alive was chatting with the old
soldiers, who were easy to find as they lounged on the courtyard
benches or as I wandered along the winding walks. If you're
fortunate, as I was, to befriend a trooper, he may lead you upstairs
to peek at the living quarters, known as the Long Wards.</TE>
<TE>   On four floors, the men are berthed in rows of wainscoted
cubicles, 9-foot-square rooms with minimal furniture and TVs. The
digs may seem cramped, but there is a cozy charm, and the berths are
far more spacious, the vets will tell you, than their army billets.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1680s, the in-pensioners have been organized along
military lines, with six companies each headed by a retired officer,
the "Captain of Invalids."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the occasional parade, the pensioners' obligations are
minimal, and they are free to leave the grounds as long as they don
the scarlet coats and ceremonial tricorn hats. The Marlborough-era
dress draws attention, a decided plus in the pubs, where patrons
spring for drinks.</TE>
<TE>   Relishing such attention and interaction, most of the veterans
will happily regale and assist visitors. "Tourists are good for us;
it's important to bring outsiders in," says Derek Parker, a retired
World War II artillery gunner who is 72 and who works part time as a
museum attendant. "I feel privileged to be here. There are not many
people who get to retire like this."</TE>
<TE>   Next door, the National Army Museum provides a panorama of British
military history from the last 500 years. Artifacts and memorabilia,
dioramas and interactive displays, and paintings and lifelike models
capture the chronology of warfare from Agincourt to the Falklands.</TE>
<TE>   Military buffs will have a field day, but so will anyone with an
appreciation for history and the grand days of the empire.</TE>
<TE>   Spread over four floors, the exhibits are far more than a
collection of muskets and machine guns, although the range of
weaponry runs from flintlocks to Kalashnikov assault rifles. Instead,
museum officials have tried to show off some of Britain's most
remarkable military episodes from an ordinary soldier's perspective,
explaining how he was clothed, fed and disciplined and how he viewed
the lifestyle and responsibilities. This has been done with
meticulous research, including rummaging battlefields, most recently
in Bosnia, for shell casings, canteens and other relics.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors interact with displays and gripping dioramas of war and
view scale-model battlefield scenes. There is a Cromwell-era helmet
to try on, and a Tudor cannonball to lift, and a computer exhibit to
test your military skills.</TE>
<TE>   There are life-size figures of an Agincourt archer, a Burgundian
hand gunner, a Royalist cavalryman and many others, and finely
embroidered 18th century grenadier hats.</TE>
<TE>   The original uniforms date back to a 1740s redcoat and, adding a
chilling touch of reality, often are accompanied by the names of the
rank-and-file soldiers who wore them. Strolling the gentle ramps from
floor to floor, visitors can see a giant model of the battlefield at
Waterloo (where the Duke of Wellington, with the aid of German,
Belgian and Dutch troops, routed Napoleon) with more than 60,000
miniature soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way there is a stunning exhibit of two centuries of
British army swords and fascinating artifacts, like the skeleton of
one of Napoleon's horses, a lamp used by Florence Nightingale, and
the saw and gloves used to amputate the Earl of Uxbridge's leg during
the battle of Waterloo. (He remarked later that the saw was a bit
dull.) A gallery brimming with oils and busts of key commanders and
sieges and a collection of 30 Victoria Crosses, Britain's highest
combat honor, round out the collection. The exhibits' scope and
professionalism help ensure broad appeal, particularly to Americans
who fought with British units.</TE>
<TE>   The American Revolution gets relatively short shrift in the
exhibit because of the few artifacts available to the British from
that war, a museum official said, and, more important, less interest
by his countrymen in documenting it.</TE>
<TE>   After all, he noted, "We lost."</TE>

<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Neonopolis, a three-story, $100-million entertainment, dining and
retail complex, is scheduled to open Thursday on downtown's Fremont
Street, sans slot machines but chock-full of other attractions
targeting tourists and local residents.</LD>
<LD>   The long-delayed project, funded in part with $40 million from the
city, will feature a 14-screen movie theater, a 100-foot-tall display
of historic and modern neon signs, an art gallery and a host of
stores and fast-food outlets.</LD>
<LD>   At opening, the 240,000-square-foot complex will be about 70%
occupied. By Labor Day, the second largest tenant, Jillian's,
featuring a restaurant, bowling lanes, billiards and a dance club, is
set to open.</LD>
<TE>   "It's going to be a really cool place, easily accessed, with lots
of parking, that will give visitors an added reason to stay downtown
after they've seen the lights of Fremont Street," said Las Vegas
Mayor Oscar Goodman.</TE>
<TE>   Neonopolis is at Las Vegas Boulevard and Fremont, where a
pedestrian mall covered by a sound-and-light canopy produces
computer-driven graphics known as the Fremont Street Experience.</TE>
<TE>   Its opening was delayed nearly two years when the initial anchor,
Mann Theatres, withdrew after its parent company, WestStar Cinemas
Inc., filed for bankruptcy protection in 1999. The city and developer
World Entertainment Centers plugged the vacancy with a new anchor
tenant, Crown 14 Theaters.</TE>

<LD>The State Department on April 16 issued a new warning on Venezuela,
advising U.S. citizens against visiting because of the deteriorating
political and security situation. In other announcements this month,
it urged Americans to be vigilant and avoid crowds and public areas
in Peru, where it cited potential terrorist activity by rebels in the
weeks before and after May 17, an anniversary for such groups. It
also urged caution in Nepal, citing an increase in Maoist violence,
and in the Philippines, citing kidnappings of foreigners and other
incidents. For more warnings or updates, call (888) 407-4747 or visit

<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>If you plan to rent a car or RV for the peak summer season, you
should act now, experts say. And you may be paying more than you did
last summer.</LD>
<LD>   "You're going to have a lot of customers vying for fewer cars and
paying higher rates" in the summer, predicted Neil Abrams, president
of New York-based Abrams Consulting Group.</LD>
<LD>   Although the rental business so far is down about 15% from a year
ago, companies have cut their fleets by that much or more, tightening
the supply of cars, he said. Rates, which usually drop a little after
Christmas, have instead increased about 30% this year, said Jon
LeSage, vice president of Long Beach-based Abrams Travel Data
Services, a subsidiary of Abrams.</LD>
<TE>   Especially for travel on peak weekends starting with Memorial Day,
"if you don't book now, you won't get the car you want," Abrams said.</TE>
<TE>   The RV outlook is more mixed. At El Monte RV in Santa Fe Springs,
which claims to be the second-largest RV rental operator in the U.S.,
business in March was up 42% from last year and "April is looking
really strong," said Joe Laing, director of marketing. As a result,
RV rental rates are somewhat higher, but a more pressing issue is
availability. "If [renters] really want to travel in July or August,
they should book by the end of May," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At Mesa, Ariz.-based Cruise America Inc., which claims to be the
largest RV rental company in North America, more Americans are
booking RVs but fewer foreigners are, said Bob Caldarone, assistant
vice president of marketing. Overall availability is therefore good
and rates are stable, he said.</TE>

<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>In the 1870s there really was no there there, just a grove of oak
trees at what is now the busy corner of Madison and 8th streets near
downtown Oakland. The area is depicted by painter Ferdinand Richardt
in "Scene in Oakland, 1852 to 2002," one of several exhibits and
events marking the 150th anniversary of the city on the other side of
the bay.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday Oakland will hold a free festival to kick off the
celebration. It will include a concert with Latin jazzman Pete
Escovedo, a block party with vintage cars, downtown walking tours and
poetry readings. Events take place all day in Frank H. Ogawa Plaza,
Preservation Park and nearby areas.</LD>
<LD>   The "Scene in Oakland" exhibit, with depictions of the city by 48
California artists, runs through Aug. 25 at the Oakland Museum of
California. At the same museum through May 12, "Being There: 45
Oakland Artists" focuses on contemporary works.</LD>
<TE>   By Saturday the Oakland History Room at the Oakland Public
Library's main branch will begin displaying about 150 photos, first
editions, record covers and other cultural artifacts in "From
Enriquez to the Hip-Hop Nation: 150 years on the Cutting Edge of
Culture in Oakland." It runs through July 31.</TE>

<HD>That Cute Dog May Carry Rabies</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While on the beach in the Bahamas, a vacationing couple noticed a dog
struggling in the water, so the husband jumped in to rescue it. He
was promptly bitten on the hand. His wife, a physician, insisted he
check in with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
to ask whether he needed to be vaccinated against rabies.</LD>
<LD>   A viral disease spread by the bite of an infected animal--or even
by a lick on broken skin, since the virus is carried in the
saliva--rabies affects the nervous system of humans and is nearly
always fatal if untreated.</LD>
<LD>   Mary Reynolds, a CDC epidemiologist, fielded the call--one of many
her office gets each year from overseas travelers panicked about the
possibility of rabies after being bitten by a stray dog, cat, bat,
monkey or other animal. After carefully examining the track record in
the Bahamas and learning there had not been reports of rabies there,
she told the man he did not need the shots. In fact, the dog was free
of rabies, and the man remained healthy.</LD>
<TE>   But not every case is as clear-cut. And because rabies has such a
high mortality rate, travel medicine experts err on the side of
caution, suggesting vaccination after a bite if there is any
possibility the animal might be rabid. It's a tough call, because an
animal's appearance and behavior can suggest it is well when it is
not.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers who are savvy about the need for vaccinations against
such scourges as yellow fever and hepatitis often don't even think to
ask about the need to protect themselves against rabies, travel
medicine experts say. Although rabies deaths are rare in the United
States, the disease is prevalent in some countries, including parts
of Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, India,
Mexico, Nepal, Peru, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and
Vietnam, according to the CDC. And rabies is found in dogs in most
other countries of Africa, Asia and Central and South America.
Worldwide, more than 40,000 people die of rabies every year,
according to the World Health Organization.</TE>
<TE>   "Rabies is an underappreciated risk," says Dr. Bradley Connor,
medical director of the New York Center for Travel and Tropical
Medicine and a travel medicine expert. He adds that children--who are
more likely to pet a stray animal--and travelers who go off the
beaten path are at greatest risk.</TE>
<TE>   Few travelers think to ask about the disease, agrees Dr. Terri
Rock, a Santa Monica family practice physician with a special
interest in travel medicine. "We counsel everyone [going to areas
where it is found] about rabies," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the traveler's destination and activities planned
while there, pre-exposure vaccination might be wise. The pre-exposure
regimen includes three doses of vaccine given over three or four
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   A traveler who has received the pre-exposure vaccine and is bitten
by a potentially rabid animal still needs two more doses of vaccine,
the first given as soon as possible and the other on the third day
after the bite, according to CDC guidelines. A traveler who was not
vaccinated before the trip and who is bitten needs an immediate
injection of anti-rabies immune globulin (which contains antibodies
to the virus) plus five doses of vaccine (which stimulate the
person's own production of antibodies), given in an initial dose and
then on Days 3, 7, 14 and 28.</TE>
<TE>   When a traveler is bitten, there is often a strong sense of denial
that the animal could be carrying rabies, Connor finds. "People don't
want to quit their trip," he says. So they tend to rationalize that
the dog didn't look or act sick and couldn't possibly be rabid.</TE>
<TE>   In some countries, travel medicine experts say, it is difficult to
find the needed vaccine. Says Rock: "Sometimes if you're bitten you
have to get to the airport and get to Europe or somewhere where there
is vaccine available." If rabies is suspected, post-exposure
vaccinations should begin as soon as possible (preferably within two
days, according to some travel medicine specialists). The CDC says
travelers headed to remote areas, where prompt medical care may not
be available, should consider pre-exposure vaccinations.</TE>
<TE>   The disease's typical incubation period is three to eight weeks,
according to the CDC, but can be much shorter. Once symptoms develop,
which may include fever, restlessness and malaise, only supportive
care is possible.</TE>
<TE>   Those who have been bitten should wash the bite with soap and
water and apply Betadine solution (purchased over the counter) if
available, advises the CDC's Reynolds. She suggests next calling the
U.S. Embassy for advice about getting medical attention and
information about the local rabies situation. Travelers can also call
the CDC at (404) 639-3311 and ask for the rabies section.</TE>
<TE>   The vaccine is expensive, partly because it is in relatively low
demand. The three-dose pre-exposure vaccine is about $450 to $750,
plus some fees for the initial consultation, which can vary.
Post-exposure vaccine, including the five doses plus immune globulin,
costs $1,000 to $4,000 in the United States, Reynolds says.</TE>
<TE>   The immunization has improved, Rock says, and rabies vaccine
injections are less painful than they used to be; generally the only
side effect is possible soreness at the injection site. The immune
globulin is given at the site of the bite, so if that is, say, on the
face, the injections hurt.</TE>

<HD>San Ysidro Canyon Trails Give Ocean Views Minus the Strain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thanks to the Montecito Trails Foundation and other local advocates,
a fine system of pathways with ocean and mountain views leads through
and around San Ysidro Canyon. Hikers have a multitude of options for
a day on these captivating trails north of the Santa Barbara coast.</LD>
<LD>   The classic canyon walk is a family-friendly path, three miles
round trip, along San Ysidro Creek to lovely pools and a small
waterfall. Connector trails lead west to Santa Barbara's attractive
and best-known canyons, Hot Springs and Cold Springs.</LD>
<LD>   But I suggest something different: Pathways leading east out of
San Ysidro Canyon. Fashion a loop with the aptly named Buena Vista
Trail (buena vista means good view) or head out on an all-day
adventure over to lovely, little-known Romero Canyon.</LD>
<TE>   The starting point for these adventures is a public trail head
behind San Ysidro Ranch, the resort known for its romantic,
bougainvillea-draped cottages and an atmosphere that manages to be
simultaneously rustic and elegant. It's the kind of place where
well-heeled ramblers sip wine in their hiking shorts and take lobster
sandwiches or Mediterranean wraps along on walks.</TE>
<TE>   Published room rates begin at $395 a night, but hikers of more
modest means can still enjoy the ranch because its restaurants
welcome non-guests. You can hike San Ysidro Canyon trails, clean up a
bit, then treat yourself to gourmet dining at the resort's Stonehouse
Restaurant or a meal at the more affordable Plow &amp; Angel Bistro, an
1889 stone packing house and wine cellar in the middle of the
500-acre ranch. Wander the fragrant gardens and enjoy sweeping vistas
of the Pacific Ocean and Channel Islands.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: From U.S. 101 in Montecito, take San
Ysidro Road north one mile to East Valley Road and turn right. Drive
a mile on East Valley to Park Lane, which appears on the left after
the bridge over San Ysidro Creek. Turn left (north) onto Park Lane,
go half a mile and veer left onto East Mountain Drive, which passes
through a residential neighborhood and dead-ends at San Ysidro Creek,
in back of San Ysidro Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   The hike: Head up San Ysidro Canyon about three-quarters of a mile
to Buena Vista Trail, an old road, and turn east. After a short stint
of mellow hiking, the trail suddenly climbs at a heart-pounding
angle. A 20- to 30-minute ascent leads to a shale-lined saddle.</TE>
<TE>   After catching your breath, take satisfaction in knowing that most
of the climbing is behind you. The old roadway gives way to a
footpath, which switchbacks down into Buena Vista Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   The trail crosses a creek to a signed junction. Bear left for the
half-mile journey to Buena Vista Overlook. Rest on the stone bench
and enjoy the coastal and mountain views. (From the overlook you can
continue another 11/2 miles east on the ridgeline before descending
into Romero Canyon and linking with another trail system. My favorite
route, a six-mile loop, begins with a tramp north on Romero Canyon's
main trail, which intersects a dirt road curving east, then south to
close the loop.)</TE>
<TE>   Most hikers, however, will retrace their steps from the overlook
back down into Buena Vista Canyon. Rejoin the Buena Vista Trail and
descend south for a mile through a lush, sycamore-shaded canyon and
past striking sandstone boulders.</TE>
<TE>   The simplest way to finish the hike is to take paved Park Lane
Road west, then East Mountain Drive west back to the trail head.
Another option is to take Park Lane Road for a bit, then join Old
Pueblo Trail for a mile-long jaunt back toward San Ysidro Trail and
your starting point.</TE>

<HD>Too Much Paris? Slip Them a Mickey</HD>

<LD>Quick--what's Europe's top tourist attraction?</LD>
<LD>   Hint: It's in France. No, it's not the Eiffel Tower. It's not even
in Paris, but it draws twice as many visitors as the Eiffel.</LD>
<LD>   Ask the kids. They won't be as surprised to learn that Europe's
top tourist destination is Disneyland Resort Paris, about 20 miles
and a 40-minute train ride east of Paris in the suburb of
Marne-la-Vallee. The Eiffel Tower, by the way, gets about 6 million
visitors annually, and the Tower of London, traditionally one of
Britain's top tourist attractions, draws 2.3 million people a year.</LD>
<TE>   When Disneyland Paris opened 10 years ago this month, many doubted
it would recoup its $2.8-billion investment. But Mickey has proved
the naysayers wrong. Each year, 12 million Disney lovers, mostly
Europeans, descend on the resort. The occupancy rate at its seven
hotels is 86%, and three more are being built. With the new
$530-million Walt Disney Studios Park (devoted to film and animation)
open next door, even more tourists are expected.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors come for the rides, shows and Disney Village, which has
concerts, a huge video arcade, movie theaters and popular American
restaurants. A golf course and a designer outlet mall, La Vallee
Shopping Village, are nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps you're thinking you would never waste a day in France
getting Goofy's autograph or riding roller coasters when you could be
visiting the Louvre or Notre Dame Cathedral or introducing the family
to French food.</TE>
<TE>   Think again. A trek to Disneyland Resort Paris can be "a nice
break from all of the culture," says Pennsylvanian Amy Barnett, who
was on the train with us on a recent drizzly morning. Barnett was
with her husband, Jeff, and their two excited grade-schoolers, Laura
and Adam. Jeff later reported that after the Disney visit, the kids
were game for more museums.</TE>
<TE>   For American kids, including my 11- and 16-year-old daughters,
there's something comforting about a visit to Mickey's house in the
middle of a trip to a country where they're struggling with the
language, unfamiliar food and a cultural overdose. The kids can even
chow down with Mickey and his friends, whether it's breakfast at
Walt's, a Tex-Mex lunch or a summer tea party at the Lucky Nugget
Saloon in Frontierland.</TE>
<TE>   About 40% of the resort's visitors are from France, 18% from
Britain and 32% from elsewhere in Europe. Cultural differences are
obvious, especially when you're standing in the park's lines. "You
really had to protect your place in line pretty aggressively, or else
people went right in front of you," Amy Barnett said. "Also, they
seemed to bump into us a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Disney's European resort covers 5,000 acres (including hotels),
making it one-sixth the size of Florida's Walt Disney World but 10
times the size of California's Disneyland Resort. Although some of
the attractions (like the beloved Peter Pan's Flight or the
interactive Honey I Shrunk the Audience 3-D movie) are identical or
similar to the ones at Disney's American parks, others are new--among
them Walt Disney Studios' parade and its Stunt Show Spectacular,
which offers a behind-the-scenes look at stunts and special effects.</TE>
<TE>   Coaster lovers will be glad to know that the Studios' Rock 'n'
Roller Coaster is intense, as is Space Mountain next door at
Disneyland Paris, where there's also the novel backward coaster
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril. And be sure to check out
Sleeping Beauty's Castle, which has stained-glass windows and
tapestries made using 500-year-old techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Chicagoan Barbra Shwom, who spent a day here with her 12-year-old
son, Nat, last summer, says the resort was a good change of pace
during a European visit.</TE>
<TE>   "So much of what you do on a trip to Europe is centered around the
adults," Shwom said. "There's something to be said for heading to a
place designed for children."</TE>

and special events.</TE>
<TE>   * By train, take the RER Line A from Paris to
Marne-la-Vallee/Chessy. There are Eurostar trains from London,
Brussels and Geneva.</TE>
<TE>   Prices at Disneyland Resort Paris are lower than at Disney parks
in the United States: about $32 for adults, $26 for children 3 to 11
for a one-day pass to one park. Children younger than 3 are free.</TE>

<HD>More Grand Treks Into the Canyon</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Susan Spano's trek into the Grand Canyon sparked fond memories for my
wife and me ("Conquering the Grand Canyon," April 14).</LD>
<LD>   In four years we hiked into the canyon three times: first in 1968
with a troop of senior Girl Scouts, and in 1970, this time with
senior Girl Scouts and Boy Scout Explorers. As we reached the river
at Bright Angel Creek junction we saw rafters shoving off to shoot
the rapids, and we knew what our next goal was. So in April '71, 28
Scouts and leaders headed down the Kaibab Trail again and had the
adventure of our lives.</LD>
<LD>   Spring is the best time to avoid the heat. Also beware of the
steep trail. I lost the nails on my toes from banging against my
boots.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In September 2000 three friends and I did the same trip in two
days. About six to nine months before the trip we hiked at least
every other weekend, mostly in the San Gabriel Mountains, and Mt.
Wilson was our big training site.</TE>
<TE>   It took us two years to get reservations at Phantom Ranch, and we
only stayed one night there, but I wish we could have stayed two and
hiked part of the North Kaibab Trail. It was more than 100 degrees
when we got to the bottom. From the bridge to the ranch I thought I
would pass out numerous times. That night I wondered how I was going
to make it back up. That last part of Bright Angel is a killer.</TE>
<TE>   I was the last one to reach the top. I was 44 years old, and it
was the worst and hardest thing I had ever done--but also the one I'm
most proud of.</TE>
<TE>   I've quit hiking since then but dream of going again to the Grand
Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   What I liked best was the feeling of being on another planet. We
played in the creek, sat around the ranch and played games, wrote
postcards and reenergized.</TE>

<HD>Adults Behave Badly Too</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Who are these self-righteous travelers demanding that parents keep
their children at home and, as Ursula Sack recommends ("More on
Traveling Tots," Letters, April 21), not out in public? Who says bad
behavior is restricted to children?</LD>
<LD>   My mother has been a flight attendant for 35 years, and the
stories she could tell you about the behavior of adults would shock
you. She's never had a child get drunk or violent on a plane.</LD>
<LD>   Of course there should be places reserved for adults: gambling
casinos, fine dining establishments etc. I believe that parents
should do everything possible to raise socially conscious, thoughtful
and considerate children, but I disagree with Sack's philosophy of
keeping them at home and never letting them venture out in public
lest they offend someone. Children need opportunities to learn what
is appropriate behavior.</LD>
<TE>   That didn't happen to a man who got drunk on a flight my mother
was working, got up and urinated on one of the passengers. Perhaps
Sack would prefer sitting next to him on her next flight, rather than
a child who occasionally whines.</TE>

<HD>Celebrating Lisbon's Sweet, Sad Soul</HD>
<DH>Passion flowers in the form of fado singing in a city of
port wine and grand views.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY V. HAINES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LISBON</DL>
<LD>These notes are being written between sets in a fado club in Bairro
Alto. Fado, part aria, part torch song, is impassioned music. I don't
speak Portuguese, so I cannot tell you exactly the subject of the
songs tonight at Adega do Ribatejo, but it must be something
significant because no one could sing so passionately about
inconsequential matters.</LD>
<LD>   The host this evening, dressed in a conservative business suit and
looking like your Uncle Steve the plumbing supplies salesman, greets
the audience, then tilts back his head and becomes a Portuguese
Pavarotti. When he is finished, the cook takes off her apron, wipes
her hands, takes center stage and begins singing.</LD>
<LD>   Fado is performed in a big, open-throated way that frees the
singer's soul. Like Lisbon, it surprises in richness and intensity.</LD>
<TE>   Lisbon's history tugs at the heart like the song of a lover,
alternately thrilling and full of despair. Portugal, a country about
the size of Michigan, shares the Iberian Peninsula with Spain,
although at times it has been like sharing a bus seat with a sumo
wrestler. That may be why, 500 years ago, the country turned its
attention toward the Atlantic, which laps at its western coast.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its diminutive size, Portugal defied the maelstroms and
monsters of the nautical charts and laid claim to far-flung lands and
riches in Africa (Angola and Mozambique), Asia (the East Indies and
Macau) and America (Brazil).</TE>
<TE>   Many of the country's voyages of exploration originated in Lisbon
(if you picture the map of Portugal as an aristocratic head in
left-facing profile, Lisbon is on the nose, about a third of the way
up the face) and began with a sail down the Tagus River.</TE>
<TE>   Portugal grew wealthy but was confronted with the demands of
administering a colonial empire, the changing whims of royalty and
the variable political winds of Europe--and some plain bad luck.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 1, 1755, the city was shaken by an earthquake that wrecked
most of its public buildings and churches and killed 60,000 people.
Brazil gained independence in 1822. Portugal lost its remaining
colonies in the late 20th century and suffered a military coup in
1974.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, however, the country's prospects have brightened. It was
admitted to the European Union in 1986, and it helped launch the
euro. Its economy is improving. Its 4% unemployment rate is one of
the lowest in Europe, and tourism is growing.</TE>
<TE>   My wife, Janice, and I briefly visited Lisbon a year ago and
agreed that this capital city of a half-million deserved more time,
so we returned for a week with our son Paul this year.</TE>
<TE>   Enjoying the city involved climbing a lot of hills. In such
situations elsewhere, I've asked, tongue in cheek, where the elevator
is. But in Lisbon there really is one. In fact, there are four.</TE>
<TE>   Our hotel was Residencial Insulana, a cozy place that occupies
three of the upper floors of a commercial building in the Baixa
retail district. When we wanted to move from the Baixa to the alleys
and night life of the Bairro Alto neighborhood 100 feet above, we
took one of those four elevadors.</TE>
<TE>   The Baixa district is at river level, but it is bracketed by hills
on the east and west. Eastward across the Baixa, looking back at
Santa Justa from the top of Sao Jorge Hill, is the Castelo, a 9th
century Moorish fortress. It shares its hill with Lisbon's Se
cathedral and the alleyways of the ancient Alfama neighborhood.
Behind us to the west and south were Bairro Alto and Chiado, also
hilltop neighborhoods, not as old as the Alfama but rich in small
bookstores, inexpensive restaurants and galleries.</TE>
<TE>   We began at the 12th century Se, just slightly uphill from the
Baixa on Rua da Conceicao. Lisbon's cathedral (technically, the
Cathedral of Santa Maria) is impressively cavernous, but its most
interesting attractions are its treasury and cloisters. The treasury
holds a gold and ruby monstrance from 1748, decorated with more than
4,000 stones. During our visit, the cloisters of the Se appeared to
be undergoing major repair and archeological research, with displaced
statuary and architectural ornaments stashed wherever they might fit
around the edges of a huge excavation.</TE>
<TE>   Next stop on the onward and upward tour was the Miradouro de Santa
Luzia. Lisbon has several miradouros, or plazas positioned to afford
striking views. From Santa Luzia's, we got a CinemaScope vista of the
Tagus and incoming maritime traffic and of the tiled rooftops of the
Alfama. And we could rest.</TE>
<TE>   Then up to the Museum of Decorative Arts, a 17th century mansion
that displays the 17th and 18th century furniture and tableware
typical of aristocratic households. Although the location is not
designated a miradouro, the views from the museum grounds also are
grand. And we could rest.</TE>
<TE>   Finally we reached the huge Castelo Sao Jorge, which is the
fulfillment of the fantasies of every kid who has built a fort out of
snow or a castle out of sofa cushions. There's not much of an
interior to see, but we could scramble up the walls and march from
tower to tower along their tops. Below us, where 12th century
Crusaders brandished swords as they tried to capture the castle from
the Moors who built it, tourists now brandished telephoto lenses,
memorializing the views back across the Baixa or toward the palms,
steeples and rooftops of the venerable Graca and Alfama districts.
Peacocks shared the courtyards and park below with playful modern
sculptures--for example, bronze people with a book, question mark or
dinner fork as heads.</TE>
<TE>   It may have been the fork that made me think of lunch, and that's
how we found a gastronomic tie-in to Portuguese history. We had many
fine Portuguese meals in Lisbon, but the Goan cuisine at the nearby
Arco do Castelo combines Portuguese and South Indian influences.
(Portugal's age of exploration extended to China and the Indian
subcontinent, and it held properties there for centuries. It lost its
colony of Goa to India only in 1961.) We found Arco's chickpea
fritters and chicken curries similar to Indian versions with a nice
coconut milk foundation.</TE>
<TE>   While more sensible people enjoyed the traditional Portuguese
siesta, we spent our afternoon exploring. As we progressed east, we
stopped first at Nossa Senhora da Graca, whose miradouro permits an
aerial view of the busy squares north of the Baixa.</TE>
<TE>   The Alfama, our next destination, is among the oldest
neighborhoods in Lisbon because it is one of the few quarters to have
survived the earthquake and subsequent fires and tidal waves of 1755.
Streets twist up and down the hillside, winding around themselves.
Maps become merely speculative. Some streets aren't really streets at
all, just steep stairways and clearly not designed for automobiles.
That hasn't stopped drivers from bringing cars to the Alfama and
parking them wherever they almost fit.</TE>
<TE>   We navigated toward the setting sun, climbing up, then down. We
ate a hearty dinner that night--satisfying Alentejano cuisine from
the Portuguese heartland at a Bairro Alto restaurant--that we figured
we had walked off in advance.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the Alfama's alleys, the streets of the Bairro Alto
and Chiado districts seem almost like Iowa in their orderliness.
Although superimposed on a rolling hilltop, the street grid is neatly
rectangular. Internet cafes, tiny restaurants and fado clubs make the
two adjoining neighborhoods an ideal evening entertainment venue.</TE>
<TE>   If you plan to hear fado, know that fado clubs are like dinner
theaters: You must eat the meal to hear the music.</TE>
<TE>   The Church of Sao Roque is a Bairro Alto highlight. Sao Roque, or
St. Roch, was an early 14th century French nobleman who renounced
riches to serve the poor. He often is pictured accompanied by a dog,
which, according to legend, once saved the saint from starvation by
smuggling bread from its master's table. The main attraction of the
church, however, is an elaborately decorated side chapel dedicated to
John the Baptist, featuring mosaics so carefully shaded that they
look at first like oil paintings.</TE>
<TE>   In the Bairro Alto we made one of our best discoveries, the
Instituto do Vinho do Porto, or Port Wine Institute. Although run by
a government agency, this converted 1747 mansion is a pleasant lounge
where one may taste dozens of ports, many for less than what a
comparable quantity of beer would cost at home. We sampled
10-year-old tawny ports for about $2.25 a glass, then returned the
next night and graduated to 20-year-old tawnies for $4.</TE>
<TE>   Although port is the wine most associated with Portugal and the
local reds are lovely, our favorite discoveries were the greens.</TE>
<TE>   Vinho verde, or "green" wine, is not really green; it's merely
young. It has a nice natural spritz to it, and it goes well with
seafood at a Bairro Alto taberna or with rotisserie chicken in
Baixa's Rei dos Frangos (literally "King of the Chickens"). A bottle
of typical vinho verde might cost as little as $5.</TE>
<TE>   One can get so spoiled in Lisbon.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the subway system is simple even if you don't
understand Portuguese. It's easy to figure out the coin-operated
ticket dispensers, and the fare schedule is uncomplicated. The cars
are clean. The system is limited, however, and does not reach many
neighborhoods (like the Alfama). But mass transportation above ground
is plentiful and takes many forms: commuter trains, buses, sleek new
trams that bend in the middle to slither around corners, neighborhood
trolleys that are only about 20 feet long so they can negotiate the
tight turns of the Alfama.</TE>
<TE>   The trolleys are so cute that they almost make me forget our only
negative experience: My wallet was stolen. Guidebooks recommend Tram
No. 28 as a charming way to ride through the old neighborhoods and to
the Saturday flea market, or Feira da Ladra. So Janice and I boarded
the crowded tram on Saturday morning, heading for the market.</TE>
<TE>   The sheer artistry of the pickpockets would have been laudable had
I not been the victim. Janice and I were separated in the crowd.
Someone brushed my camera, and the lens cap fell to the floor. As
Janice and I searched for it, two middle-aged men kept jostling me as
they disagreed over which of them should take the empty seat next to
me. Then they were gone, and so was my wallet.</TE>
<TE>   I can report that Lisbon police are polite and sympathetic, and
that they helped us contact our credit card companies. They gave us
advice that was echoed by our hotel's concierge and other locals: You
have to be careful on Tram 28; it's notorious for pickpockets.</TE>
<TE>   Did I mention that Feira da Ladra means "thieves' market"?</TE>
<TE>   We saw numerous museums--the tile museum, the Museu Gulbenkian and
its huge, eclectic collection--and we finally came to the Casa do
Fado e da Guitarra Portuguesa. This new museum on the river's edge
east of the Baixa tells the story of fado, with its lost love and
missed chances. ("I want my coffin to be shaped in a splendid way,"
one verse starts, "to be shaped like a heart, to be shaped like a
guitar.")</TE>
<TE>   The museum probably is useful for people who already know
something of the genre and its stars, but there are helpful basic
exhibits explaining, in English and Portuguese, its history and the
craft of guitar making. Fado singers usually are accompanied by two
guitarists, one with a heart-shaped 12-string guitar, the other with
a more conventional Spanish guitar.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings me back to my fado club notes: As they wait to resume
performing, the two guitarists are chatting with the club's regular
patrons. The host steps back to center stage. Once again the poignant
Portuguese melodies resound, bouncing off the tiles, or azulejos,
ringing the cooking pots in the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   And once again, I am transported.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: It's a stairway to heaven, Culver City reader Mary
Lang says of these terraced rice fields by the Filipino village of
Batad. Lang shot this photo while slogging along a mucky, 51/2-mile
unpaved road on a warm, humid day in 1999. A guide promised Lang and
her sister, Ann, that an incredible view lay ahead, but with the
countryside blanketed in a blinding mist, they weren't so sure. "We
rounded a corner," Lang says, "and the view just took our breath
away." The mist had cleared over Batad, where the stunning scenery
was matched with odd juxtapositions of rural life. "The people had no
shoes, but they wore prescription glasses," Lang says. She found the
village and its people calm and comforting. "It was like a place out
of time--dreamlike."</CP>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I am sitting in a rocking chair on the porch of a little hotel in a
town called Lily Dale in upstate New York. The lake out front is
tinged pink with the sunset. A swan glides by. Frogs croak. I curl
into the rocker. This is peace, I think.</LD>
<LD>   This memory, from a visit 10 years ago to Lily Dale Assembly, a
summer retreat for Spiritualists who believe that the dead
communicate with the living through mediums, is a travel touchstone
for me. It reminds me that one of the things I like best about travel
is learning how other people live and, for a little while, trying out
their lifestyles and beliefs. That motivation has taken me to
Morocco's Anti-Atlas Mountains and Chongqing, China.</LD>
<LD>   In Lily Dale, about 60 miles southwest of Buffalo, you have only
to scratch the surface to find stunningly different ways of being.</LD>
<TE>   The Lily Dale community, with its winding lanes, Victorian
cottages, stalwart old shade trees and rose gardens, was founded in
1879, when interest in seances, mediums and psychic phenomena swept
the country, capturing the hopes of people disaffected with
traditional religion and attracting such notables as philosopher and
psychologist William James, Sherlock Holmes creator Arthur Conan
Doyle and First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln.</TE>
<TE>   The Spiritualist religion, based on the belief that the spirits of
the dead can communicate with the living, grew out of that spike in
parapsychological interest. Today the National Spiritualist Assn. of
Churches has only about 4,000 U.S. congregations. (By comparison, the
United Methodist Church has about 35,000 U.S. congregations.) Some
features of the religion, such as its fascination with the afterlife,
have been subsumed by the more inclusive New Age movement.</TE>
<TE>   Lily Dale is frumpier than New Age power spots like the Esalen
Institute in Big Sur. At the New York community, a sort of "old New
Age" persists in a faded Victorian postage stamp of a summer retreat,
where people come to commune with the dead. This season, from June 28
to Sept. 1, about 40 mediums registered by the Lily Dale board of
directors will hang signs on sweet little gingerbread cottages
advertising their services. (A 30-minute reading costs $35 to $100.)
Between private sessions, the mediums lecture and lead daily "message
services" during which they receive communications from the beyond
for audience members.</TE>
<TE>   "People in parapsychological research are skeptical of Lily Dale,"
says Loyd Auerbach, a San Francisco-based paranormal investigator. He
thinks the mediums there are sincere but notes that even sincere
people can persuade themselves that they have psychic abilities they
don't really have.</TE>
<TE>   Last year 22,000 people visited the leafy, slow-lane community,
which has its own post office, cafeteria, library, auditorium,
museum, hotel and 101-year-old volunteer fire department.</TE>
<TE>   Most attend daily message services, then get a private reading.
Others, like me, are gentle skeptics who go out of curiosity and for
the history. I stayed in the Maplewood Hotel by the lake, built in
1880, where the rates remain positively Victorian ($59 for a double
with private bath). Its old wood floors creak, and some say it's
haunted (which is not a scary thing to a Spiritualist). On a wall
downstairs is a portrait of a man in a toga titled "Azur the Helper,"
reputedly painted by spirits during a seance in 1898.</TE>
<TE>   Lily Dale mediums were highly theatrical a century ago. Some
invoked the dead to create paintings like the one in the hotel, or
they channeled spirits to speak through the bell of a trumpet. But
mediums who practice there now are far more buttoned-up, simply
sitting with clients and reporting what their dear departed say about
health, relationships and careers.</TE>
<TE>   Artifacts in the Lily Dale museum recall 19th century psychic
showmanship, including a metal trunk from the basement of a cottage
in Hydesville, N.Y., where a series of tenants heard inexplicable
rapping in the night. In 1848, sisters Margaret and Kate Fox, who
lived in the cottage at the time, reportedly solved the riddle of the
rapping. They said they had managed to communicate with the spirit
responsible for the noise, a peddler who had been killed and buried
in the basement, leaving his trunk behind. The sisters went on to
demonstrate their psychic gifts to enthusiastic audiences across the
country. The cottage where their reputed ability to communicate with
the dead first blossomed was moved to Lily Dale, where it burned in
1955.</TE>
<TE>   The museum also has a photo of suffragette Susan B. Anthony,
commemorating an 1891 speech she gave in the auditorium. Like the
Chautauqua Institution 20 miles southwest, founded as a summer camp
for Methodist Sunday school teachers in 1874, Lily Dale welcomed
progressive thinkers and enlightened debate. But when a Lily Dale
medium told Anthony at a seance that her late aunt was trying to
reach her, the women's rights advocate reportedly said to the spirit,
"I didn't like you when you lived, and I don't care to talk to you
now."</TE>
<TE>   During my visit, I had to call my mother every night to reassure
her that I was still Episcopalian. She was horrified to learn that I
had had a reading with a medium. But at Lily Dale, how could I not?</TE>
<TE>   Time has shown that the medium's predictions for me were wrong on
all counts. But the reading did start me thinking about deep things,
which is what people at Lily Dale do all summer. I like that about
them--and the brief peace a skeptic can find in one of their rockers.</TE>

<LD>It's one of my most vivid travel memories: sitting in the sand on a
Costa Rican beach in the moonlight watching as huge leatherback
turtles hauled themselves out of the sea. Lumbering up to dry sand,
they cleared out a hollow with their flippers, settled in and then,
in a trancelike state, deposited their eggs. In less than 90 minutes
they camouflaged the nest with sand and worked their way back to the
sea, leaving a trail that looked as if a tractor had carved it.</LD>
<LD>   On this Pacific Coast beach, called Playa Grande, at Parque
Nacional Marino Las Baulas de Guanacaste, up to 100 of the creatures,
which average 800 pounds, deposit their eggs each night during the
nesting season, from October through March. It is now easier for
young budget-minded travelers to take in this natural spectacle
because a Costa Rican youth hostel has opened in the village of
Tamarindo, just south of Playa Grande. Tours leave from Tamarindo.</LD>
<LD>   Tamarindo stretches a mile along the Pacific Coast, and the
Hostelling International facility at El Milagro Hotel,
011-506-653-0042, fax 011-506-653-0050, www.elmilagro.com, is close
to the town center.</LD>
<TE>   It can accommodate up to 85 people in 30 hillside bungalows. The
rate is $85 per night for a two-bed bungalow, $18 per bed per night
for Hostelling International members. The hostel has a pool, gardens
and a restaurant; rooms have private bathrooms, hot water and
air-conditioning or fans. Reservations are required.</TE>
<TE>   You can reach Tamarindo by bus from San Jose in about six hours.
The Costa Rican Youth Hostel Assn. has 13 hostels near key areas
throughout the country. Several new hostels were added recently: El
Ancla in Naranjo Beach, La Laguna del Lagarto Lodge in San Carlos and
Cabinas San Isidro in Puntarenas Beach.</TE>
<TE>   For details on all Costa Rica HI hostels log on to www.hicr.org.

<TE>   If you are traveling solo in Europe on your first budget
backpacking adventure, consider using the Busabout hop-on-hop-off bus
geared to backpackers and student-style travelers. This year Bus-
about will link 66 cities in 14 countries through Oct. 31. Students,
teachers and travelers under 26 with international identification get
discounted rates.</TE>
<TE>   Busabout isn't as flexible and its service isn't as frequent as a
rail pass. Busabout stops are serviced at least every second day. And
you won't meet as many local residents as you would using mass
transportation. But novice travelers will get more guidance with
Busabout, because each bus has a guide to help with advice and
information and to take reservations for accommodations along the
routes. You'll also get dropped off and picked up at selected
hostels, eliminating worries about landing in a foreign city and
trying a hostel.</TE>
<TE>   Your family can contact you through Busabout's London office,
which can check where you last used its service and then send an
e-mail to the coach on which you are traveling. Travelers can begin
and end at any point along the route.</TE>
<TE>   Busabout has two types of passes. A Flexi Pass offers a set number
of days of travel within a limited time period--such as six days
within one month for $259 ($229 for students, youth and teachers) or
20 days within three months for $729 ($659 for students, youth and
teachers).</TE>
<TE>   Consecutive Passes offer unlimited travel from two weeks, which
costs $269, or $239 for students, youth and teachers, to a full
season, costing $1,069 or $959. Both passes cost slightly less if you
start traveling before May 15. Return transportation from London is
an additional $60. You can also add visits to the Greek Islands;
Corfu, Greece; Ibiza, Spain; and Corsica, France; or Morocco and
Croatia.</TE>
<TE>   For more information, call (800) 664-4046, www.busabout.com.
Busabout brochures also are available from travel agencies.</TE>

<DH>The makers of 'Living With the Dead' talk about spooky
coincidences during the filming of the CBS movie.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To hear the participants describe it, CBS' four-hour movie "Living
With the Dead" was literally a spirited production. "There was
definitely some intervention from the other side on this miniseries,"
said executive producer Stanley M. Brooks.</LD>
<LD>   "Living With the Dead," which will be shown on Sunday and Tuesday,
is based on the life of James Van Praagh, who purports to talk with
people who have died. The author of the bestseller "Talking to
Heaven," Van Praagh claims he's been seeing dead people since he was
a youngster. "When I first saw the movie 'The Sixth Sense,' I said,
'That's my childhood,'" he said.</LD>
<LD>   Though a skeptic might dismiss it as so much movie hype, Van
Praagh and Brooks say they are at a loss to explain all the odd
coincidences that occurred on the set last summer in Vancouver. For
example, they say, the actress who plays Van Praagh's mother as a
young woman, without prompting, combed her hair exactly the same way
his real mother did.</LD>
<TE>   "The actual wallpaper in the bedroom was exactly the wallpaper I
had as a kid in my bedroom," Van Praagh said, listing a series of
events that he says occurred without him giving the filmmakers
advance information. "Then they [the producers] wanted me to do a
cameo in the show, so it just happened the day I was up in
[Vancouver], they wanted me to be the organ player. When I was a
little boy, they wanted me to be an organ player for the church. Even
Jack Palance [who plays his father] uses expressions as the character
that sound exactly like my father."</TE>
<TE>   The spookiest occurrence for Van Praagh involved his grandmother,
who had died before he was born. There is a scene in the first
evening of the miniseries in which the ghost of the grandmother
appears at the hospital after Van Praagh's mother has suffered a
severe stroke.</TE>
<TE>   "I showed the miniseries to my sister," Van Praagh said. "My
sister knew my grandmother. My sister starts crying her eyes out. I
said, 'What's the matter?' She said, 'You don't understand--that
looks exactly like how Grandma used to look!'"</TE>
<TE>   "Living With the Dead" stars Ted Danson as Van Praagh, a divorced
man with a failing business who comes to terms with his psychic gifts
and begins to help police solve murder cases. Mary Steenburgen,
Danson's wife, plays a police detective; Diane Ladd plays Van
Praagh's mother.</TE>
<TE>   John Pielmeier, who penned the play "Agnes of God," wrote the
teleplay; Stephen Gyllenhaal ("A Killing in a Small Town") was the
director.</TE>
<TE>   Two years before the production, Danson and Steenburgen had
several readings with Van Praagh. "I almost didn't want to do it,"
Danson said of the project. "A lot of times, I prefer keeping what I
care about in life separate from what I do acting-wise. We
reluctantly came to it, but I am thrilled that we did it."</TE>
<TE>   The Emmy Award-winning actor said that Van Praagh is just a
regular guy with amazing abilities. "It's so funny: When you are
around him, it is so mundane. It is almost like [he says], 'Do you
want to speak to somebody who has passed over or do you want to get a
cappuccino?'"</TE>
<TE>   Danson is a bit reluctant to talk about his experiences with Van
Praagh. "The only thing that is tricky about it is, it is either part
of your belief system or not," said the actor. He eventually reveals
that his relationship with his late father changed after his meetings
with Van Praagh.</TE>
<TE>   "My father had died about six months beforehand," Danson said. "I
went from one kind of relationship of lingering sadness and a
low-grade kind of depression....I used to wake up mildly depressed.
After that evening with James, I wake up mildly amused and
delighted."</TE>
<TE>   He continued: "I think it is far easier believing what James said
than it would be to come up with a different angle or explanation. I
think the real communication that the film captures is James' message
in life that there is nothing but, ultimately, love and forgiveness.
You certainly walk away from an evening with James with that kind of
message."</TE>
<TE>   The first two hours of the miniseries follows Van Praagh's early
life and his experience with the Catholic Church, but the murder
mystery that dominates the second half is fictional. "It was gleaned
from many situations and experiences that I had working with police
departments and working on kidnappings," he said. "And one kidnapping
in particular--a case of a 3-year-old girl in Louisiana."</TE>
<TE>   The girl's kidnapping and murder were so grisly, he said, that he
informed the police it would be his last case.</TE>
<TE>   Van Praagh, who will host his own syndicated TV series in the
fall, says he can turn his powers on and off like a radio. "I tune
myself to a certain frequency," he said. "It is where you put your
awareness and focus. I put myself in that receptive place and become
very aware of spirits. That's when I begin my work. When I finish, I
turn off the radio and I take away any of that power of awareness, if
you will."</TE>
<TE>   "Living With the Dead" can be seen Sunday and Tuesday at 9 p.m. on
CBS. The network has rated it TV-PG (may be inappropriate for young
children), with an advisory for violence on the second night.</TE>

<HD>El Toro's Defining Moment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Navy Department's big decision on El Toro last week was
unmistakable in its significance, if bureaucratically turgid in
style. The federal government "leaves the selection of the means to
achieve redevelopment to the acquiring entity and the local zoning
authorities."</LD>
<LD>   The translation: The locals in Orange County will get to plan El
Toro in concert with the eventual developers of the park plan. There
were some good reasons an aviation option should have been preserved
for El Toro, but with that scenario off the table, the thing that has
been missing all along is now present. Clarity. Hooray for that.</LD>
<LD>   The Navy did the right thing in agreeing that there was an
appropriate local plan to redevelop the base and a legitimate
authority on the ground to implement it. At last, the most important
land-use question to come before Orange County during its long period
of growth and development after World War II was settled. Key players
in Orange County and Washington--federal, county and local
officials--were lined up.</LD>
<TE>   Irvine had pulled together a plan that shrewdly provided the
federal government something it had come to value: cash or the
prospect of it in return for relinquishing the base to local control.
The city government, long criticized for floating a plan of a Great
Park simply as a way to shoot down a commercial airport, essentially
rose to the federal government's challenge in recent weeks and showed
that it really had been thinking this thing through.</TE>
<TE>   Following the convincing passage of the Measure W park initiative
in March, the Navy had said that it simply wanted to unload surplus
property but also challenged Orange County to come up with a unified
plan. Irvine was able to include enough of a carrot to entice the
federal government--the proceeds from a part of the land that would
be sold for development--and to appeal for unity to the previously
divided county government. With the help of key swing votes, the
Board of Supervisors wisely decided not to stand in the way.</TE>
<TE>   There were many potential hitches. The lobbying by Los
Angeles-area politicians of federal aviation officials to override
the Measure W vote created last-minute confusion. With a regionwide
approach apparently killed for good after the passage of the ballot
initiative, the Los Angeles officials made a last-ditch effort in
recent days to go to Washington over the heads of the Orange County
locals.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, efforts by officials beyond the borders of Orange
County to make the case for an airport at El Toro had been more
collegial than what we saw in the final hours. There was a case made
largely through the powers of persuasion that all must share in the
burden for providing new airport capacity.</TE>
<TE>   At some point arguments must give way to reality. Carrying the
fight beyond that just creates enemies. El Toro always has been more
than a debate about regional aviation needs. It has been a question
about how local land use planning has and should be done. The long
battle between southern cities and the county government over the
makeup of the Local Redevelopment Authority for El Toro was largely
about that question.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the federal government either was going to have to
disregard what the locals decided, or keep faith with them. Irvine,
meanwhile, positioned itself to do what it has been doing
successfully now for more than a generation, namely, carrying out
large-scale master planning on the Irvine Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   The southern portion of the base earmarked for sale now can be
planned in a manner consistent with the nearby Irvine Spectrum, and
in the process, include some housing. Irvine long had lamented that
it did not try to annex the base previously, well before the base
closing was announced in 1993. Now it has its chance.</TE>
<TE>   And now the county gets a real community plan after a journey of a
thousand miles.</TE>

<HD>Opening Up the 91 Freeway</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Companies that operate private toll roads are all about maximizing
profit for shareholders. Their interests are at odds with the vast
majority of motorists who don't use or can't afford pricey pay lanes.
The Orange County Transportation Authority's decision to buy the
controversial 91 Express Lanes will lead to practical solutions for
more than 250,000 motorists who approach daily commutes on the
Riverside Freeway with a sense of dread.</LD>
<LD>   OCTA's $207.5-million agreement to buy 10 miles of toll lanes is
an expensive solution, and the riders are going to have to pay, at
least for a while. But when the state passes legislation allowing
OCTA to collect tolls needed to pay for the purchase, the California
Private Transportation Co. no longer will be able to veto
improvements to the Riverside Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   Legislators in Sacramento during the early 1990s viewed toll roads
as a win-win situation. The public-private partnerships crafted
during an era of tight budgets were touted as a neat solution to
ever-increasing demand for more highway lanes. The 91 Express Lanes
did produce desperately needed pavement along a 10-mile stretch of
the congested Riverside Freeway.</LD>
<TE>   The 91 Express Lanes unexpectedly added to the traffic jams in the
late 1990s, though, when Caltrans unveiled a plan to improve traffic
flow along a stretch of the highway near Coal Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   The toll lanes operator sued the state, arguing that a
noncompetition clause required payments when improvements on public
lanes siphoned off its paying customers. The private company demanded
a $4-million ransom before the state could add lanes along a
1,000-yard stretch of freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The for-profit operator's ability to scuttle common sense
illuminated the faulty logic underlying the private roads. Highways
are more than a conduit for harried commuters. A freeway that turns
into a parking lot during key commuting hours also represents a
serious economic bottleneck for Orange and Riverside counties.</TE>
<TE>   The toll lanes' operator used the noncompetition clause as a lever
to create artificial demand for its services. A strategy that
benefited only those motorists who can buy their way out of traffic
jams is flawed.</TE>
<TE>   An agreement that hamstrings government's ability to do its job by
improving the flow of traffic on a public road never should have been
signed.</TE>
<TE>   The 91 Express Lanes also is a cautionary tale of what goes wrong
when adjacent counties adopt inconsistent solutions to common
problems. Riverside used traditional road-funding methods during the
1990s to widen its section of the freeway; Orange County's
public-private partnership produced the controversial toll lanes.</TE>
<TE>   The result was a strategic roadblock that stymied a cooperative
effort to alleviate traffic jams on a highway whose traffic will more
than double during the next 20 years. OCTA's agreement to buy the
controversial lanes provides a welcome end to a misguided chapter in
the county's toll road experiment.</TE>

<LD>The "2002 in 2002" conference held this month in Anaheim drew
hundreds of Latino high school and college students. The Hispanic 100
in February lured the state's three Republican candidates for
governor to an invitation-only luncheon in Orange County. The numbers
embedded in the names of the two organizations, and what they say
about the political aspirations of the Latino community, should send
a powerful message. Despite the political victories of Latino
candidates in recent years, some still might view the county's
fast-growing Latino population as a small and single-minded voting
bloc.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County's diversity is evident in statistics spun off by the
2000 U.S. census. Latinos are the county's largest minority group,
having grown 46% to a total of 875,579 residents between 1990 and
2000. A decade ago, the county was the 19th most diverse in the
state; Orange County now is the state's 14th most diverse county.</LD>
<LD>   The two recent meetings offer proof that the days of referring to
"Latino voters" as a bloc are over. As more people become active in
politics, Latino voters are likely to face a wider range of political
choice--that is, if they become involved.</LD>
<TE>   The Anaheim meeting's sponsor hopes to register 2,002 young Latino
voters in Orange County before the November elections. The group also
hopes to engage young Latinos by getting them involved in an array of
civic activities. That message was drummed home repeatedly during the
meeting. Numbers don't count, young Latinos were told, if the largest
minority group in the county's public schools doesn't get involved.</TE>
<TE>   Lack of involvement in political and civic matters isn't the core
issue for members of the newly formed Hispanic 100. This group is
top-heavy with Republican business leaders, and its members hope to
advance their particular vision of Latino issues. In the process, the
Hispanic 100 is sending a message that politicians who rely upon a
one-size-fits-all message risk missing or alienating Orange County's
increasingly diverse Latino community.</TE>

<LD>Re "Spending Limits OKd in Special Elections," April 17:</LD>
<LD>   Before the Board of Supervisors extends county finance
restrictions to special elections, it should consider the following:</LD>
<LD>   The current county code severely restricts what middle-class
candidates can receive in contributions from their supporters. Yet it
allows wealthy candidates to contribute unlimited amounts of their
own money to their own campaigns. While the county code restrictions
may have been intended to reduce the influence of money in elections,
it gives wealthy candidates an unfair advantage over those who must
rely on the generosity of supporters.</LD>
<TE>   The restriction also discriminates against married couples,
allowing them to contribute only half as much as single people. A
single person may give $1,000. If a husband contributes $1,000, for
example, his wife can give nothing. This raises serious
equal-protection questions.</TE>
<TE>   Have campaign restrictions opened up the political process? In the
March primary, six of nine county incumbents ran unopposed. With few
local choices, voter turnout sank to record lows.</TE>
<TE>   Changes in the law are needed to level the political playing
field. Restrictions on political giving have become restrictions on
free speech.</TE>

<LD>Re "Time for a Pollution Solution," April 21:</LD>
<LD>   In June, the Orange County Sanitation District has to decide
whether to ask for an extension of a waiver which allows the dumping
of 240 million gallons of primary and secondary sewage into the
ocean. Getting rid of the waiver is a no-brainer. More than 16,000
sanitation districts don't have waivers. Our beaches are
contaminated. The solution is go to full secondary treatment and get
rid of the waiver.</LD>

<HD>Special Education Commentary Off Mark</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "In Special Ed, Accountability Is Left Behind," Commentary, April
17:</LD>
<LD>   I am the principal of an elementary school in the Placentia-Yorba
Linda Unified School District. Before becoming an administrator I
taught handicapped children for 18 years. The commentary was not as
accurate as it should have been.</LD>
<LD>   Contrary to Ruben Navarrette Jr.'s statement that "students can be
enrolled on the referral of a teacher," there is a defined process
that every school in the state must follow. The commentary was
correct when it stated that "removal requires a consensus of a team."
The entire process is full of safeguards to ensure that the student
is placed in a setting that will optimize developmental and
educational growth. Once a student no longer meets the criteria
established by law for placement in a special education program, the
student is placed in another program.</LD>
<TE>   I think you have done a great disservice to the hundreds of
parents and specialists who work diligently with students with a wide
range of disabilities. Special education is not a "dumping ground for
kids with behavioral problems." It is a specialized program of
services provided for some very special individuals who are included
in educators belief in "learning for all ... no matter what it
takes."</TE>
<TE>   Brian McKernan</TE>
<TE>   Principal,</TE>
<TE>   Mabel Paine Elementary School,</TE>
<TE>   Yorba Linda</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am a retired special education teacher who has worked with
children who had mild to moderate learning disabilities. Navarrette
states that "students can be enrolled on the referral of a teacher."
This is not true.</TE>
<TE>   In most cases, the students are mainstreamed as soon as possible
and collaborative teaching takes place before the student is
completely mainstreamed. Most of the teachers who enter this field
have six to seven years of university training and are dedicated to
meeting the students' needs.</TE>
<TE>   Special education does not pay for itself and is not
self-perpetuating. Some of the funding comes from the regular school
fund because the federal government does not provide the amount
agreed upon to cover expenses.</TE>
<TE>   There are many misperceptions about special education, but it is
there to help the students achieve. It is also a team effort that
involves the school and its individual teachers and administrators,
the student and the parents. When the parents perceive special
education as a program to help their child grow, the student usually
progresses.</TE>
<TE>   Joan Sorge</TE>
<TE>   Dana Point</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was absolutely unbelievable that you would publish Navarrette's
commentary. Don't you read your own editorial page? Perhaps in Texas
it is true that "special education is cheap" and that it "pays for
itself." But our schools struggle because special education
encroaches on the general fund.</TE>
<TE>   It is not uncommon for a student with an IQ of 8 to have a
per-pupil cost of $100,000. Every school district in Orange County
has such program costs. You can't get to this story through the
school-house door because of confidentiality laws. But you can get to
this story through the door of the district's business office, with
just a look at the budget. The current school budget cuts will fall
disproportionately upon the education of our academically gifted,
artistically talented and economically "at risk."</TE>

<LD>Re "School Excels in Reading by Sticking With What Works," April 1:</LD>
<LD>   Your article made me smile when it mentioned that the
phonics-based program called Open Court is gaining notice nationally.
It seems that Open Court is making believers of many teachers in the
Los Angeles Unified School District.</LD>
<LD>   My older children, now 27 and 29, were fortunate to be in the
first-grade classroom of a wonderful teacher.</LD>
<TE>   The late Wanda Nicholas was a strong advocate of Open Court over
20 years ago in the Westminster School District. She retired the year
that California dropped Open Court from its state-approved reading
programs. I'm glad to see it's been rediscovered.</TE>

<LD>Re "Mission Viejo, a City on Move," March 22:</LD>
<LD>   Recently The Times reported that move-in day had arrived at the
new Mission Viejo City Hall. Readers learned that the building was
supposed to cost between $10 million and $12 million, but that
overruns pushed the total to $22million.</LD>
<LD>   Government officials have no incentive to prevent such overruns,
since the taxpayers, and not the officials, bear the burden. So why
don't we taxpayers impose the following constraint: If a cost overrun
occurs, each and every government official must pay a penalty from
their own funds. I'll bet a percentage of my gross income that this
policy will stop cost overruns.</LD>

<LD>   I believe the article was out of context and made some good people
out to be something other than what they actually are. It took a
donation and twisted it into corporate greed.</LD>
<LD>   I was irritated that the reporter tried to make Etnies look like
an evil company trying to manipulate the city of Lake Forest. As far
as I am concerned, someone giving that much money should be given
some special privileges.</LD>
<TE>   The Etnies deal is like a good deed that is being looked at
differently by the newspaper. I'll bet there are plenty of facilities
in cities around the country that are named after their sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   Don't confuse a donation with blatant marketing efforts. I think
Etnies should be applauded for stepping in, offering to help make
sure the city gets a well-designed skate park and offering to pay to
make sure it happens that way.</TE>

<TE>   While USC marketing professor Michael A. Kamins pontificates from
his ivory tower about the fall of civilization because cities are
willing to partner with private entities in order to save the
taxpayers money, the average working taxpayer appreciates the
ingenuity of cities like Lake Forest. What is so inappropriate about
having a skateboard apparel company and other local businesses
helping to fund a skate park?</TE>
<TE>   Sheldon Zeiler</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Skateboarding is an authentic lifestyle, evidenced by its
significant global fashion and sporting influence. Etnies is, quite
literally, an icon of that lifestyle. That the company expanded the
relevance of skateboarding past its production lines is simply an
evolution of its core value: to promote the sport and spirit of
skateboarding.</TE>
<TE>   Etnies originally did this through the production of innovative
shoe designs. All it's doing now, with respect to sponsoring a park,
is expanding its influence to wholesome initiatives in the community.
By including its moniker in the mix, the company is not claiming
"ownership" of any advertising real estate; rather, it's using its
name, a bellwether brand in the world of action sports, to further
expand the relevance of skateboarding and to afford board sports
enthusiasts new opportunities to participate in a clean, social,
healthy activity.</TE>
<TE>   If the company wants to sponsor a park, it's doing it for all the
right reasons. To invoke the Etnies name in support of a hackneyed
"Desecration by Corporate Sponsorship" story line demonstrates a
complete lack of insight.</TE>

<TE>   I find it ironic that a business professor at USC would lament the
fact that Etnies paid the city of Lake Forest $100,000 for naming
rights to a skate park. Isn't Michael A. Kamins a professor at the
Marshall Business School? This blatant example of naming rights must
outrage him. Let's see if the hypocritical Kamins resigns in protest
unless the Marshall name is taken off the USC business school. Maybe
the professor in his outrage will also look around campus for any
other violations of naming rights. I wouldn't hold my breath.</TE>

<LD>Re "Capistrano Unified Can Afford Teacher Raises," Letters, April 14:</LD>
<LD>   I have remained silent long enough. I have been a team player,
believing in the leadership of the Capistrano Unified School
District. I've been doing what I consider the most joyous calling on
earth, the job of educating our children. But today I must break my
silence and appeal to my community.</LD>
<LD>   I am bewildered by the apparent lack of awareness of the leaders
of Capistrano Unified. I am confused by the constant trickle of
incomplete information that they are releasing to both the staff and
the community. I am amazed that they are unwilling to do for their
teachers what they are so willing to do for themselves.</LD>
<TE>   What is wrong with the calculators at the district office? It has
been printed numerous times that Capistrano Unified teachers received
a "13% raise" last year. Although the teachers were given a 13%
raise, it was not retroactive for the entire year. Therefore, only a
10% raise ended up in our pockets last year.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers in Capistrano Unified are losing faith in their leaders.
The district superintendent is the highest-paid superintendent in
Orange County, while the district's teachers are 16th and dropping. I
entreat the public to lend their support to the 2,200 teachers as we
seek a just settlement in our contract negotiations.</TE>

<TE>   I am compelled to make certain that facts are clear regarding
negotiations between Capistrano Unified and its teachers union. With
all due respect to Richard Broberg's April 14 letter, the salary
schedule for Capistrano teachers was improved by 13% last year--not
10% as asserted in his letter. Not only is this 13% increase a matter
of public record, but it was acknowledged by Broberg's own union in
the Feb. 11 edition of its publication, Bargaining Bytes. In addition
to the 13% increase, 75% of the district's 2,200 teachers received an
additional increment of between 2.5% and 11% simply as a result of
moving up on the salary schedule. Barbara Ness is simply incorrect in
her April 21 letter to assert that the district is citing salaries
for non-classroom personnel with teaching credentials. Top salaries
of $81,000 and more are being earned by teachers in the classroom, a
fact that we cite to show that we indeed value well-paid teachers.</TE>

<LD>Re "Bishop Responds to Sex Abuse Scandal," April 20:</LD>
<LD>   If Orange County Bishop Tod D. Brown believes in healing,
cleansing and a humble, holier church, he could start by demanding
the resignation of Catholic cardinals, from Bernard Law to Roger M.
Mahony, who covered up cases of sexual abuse.</LD>
<LD>   That kind of advocacy would require integrity, morality and
decisive action, something lacking in Catholic leaders who hide in
the safe harbor of committee meetings and hand-wringing. The
cover-ups and evasions by church leaders have disgraced the Catholic
Church and its people, yet the bishops continue to act as victims of
unfortunate circumstances. It took anguished victims and secular
authorities to uncover the scandals they hid in their Byzantine
bureaucracy.</LD>

<LD>Re "The El Toro Roles of Agran and Correa," Letters, April 14:</LD>
<LD>   The allegation made by Frank Lunding that former Mayor Christina
Shea opposed the Great Park initiative is simply wrong. For many
weekends, Shea volunteered to gather signatures in order to qualify
this initiative. Moreover, the afternoon before the March 5 election,
we both passed out literature in front of a supermarket and urged

<TE>   Re "O.C. Supervisors Vote to Give Closed El Toro Base to Irvine,"
April 17:</TE>
<TE>   It is refreshing to finally see consensus among our county
supervisors for the benefit of their residents. After years of
wrangling over an airport with pressure to remedy the needs and
demands of all the other surrounding counties, the citizens have
prevailed and shown that they do not want an international airport in
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The county can now go to the Navy with well-conceived plans for
the last large tract available in Orange County for recreational and
educational purposes. An urban park will be a true legacy for all
residents.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Schwartz</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What happened to the Great Park? Only last month the voters
defeated the airport proposal and approved a Great Park for El Toro.
Now, the county supervisors have approved the transfer of the base to
Irvine, which does not plan to create a great park, or even a good
park.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Irvine plans housing (228 acres), a research park (126
acres), a college campus (370 acres), the Orange County Fair (300
acres) and wholesale nurseries (473 acres). An additional 1,700 acres
(out of 4,700 total) would be used for two golf courses and sports
fields.</TE>
<TE>   Hardly a great park.</TE>
<TE>   The voters first voted for an airport several years ago, but
changed their minds in March because the Great Park captured their
imagination. Now, the supervisors and Irvine have arrogantly violated
the trust of the voters.</TE>
<TE>   We voted for a Great Park, like Central Park in New York, Hyde
Park in London or even Balboa Park in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   We showed our vision by voting for the creation of a unique open
space within an urban area. Instead, our vision has been compromised
by shortsighted politics. Using only a third of the base for park
purposes, and then placing golf courses there, is a mediocre park at
best.</TE>

<LD>Re "Airlines Fight for Space at Long Beach Airport," April 2:</LD>
<LD>   American Airlines seems to be repeating at Long Beach a move it
made years earlier at John Wayne Airport. I guess every airline wants
a monopoly if it can get it. American achieved a dominant position at
John Wayne Airport by buying out one of the smaller airlines.</LD>
<LD>   Also, I seem to recall that American voiced opposition to
downwind, uphill takeoffs into the mountains when the anti-airport
activists were complaining about the easterly departures from the
planned El Toro international airport. Might that have been a move by
American to protect its near-monopoly status? If so, I would say it
is mischievous.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Ordinance Proposed to Limit Slate Mailers," Letters, April 14:</LD>
<LD>   While I was somewhat surprised, I welcome Irvine Councilman Greg
Smith's sudden change of mind regarding election reform in Irvine.
Two years ago, I was one of the speakers urging the Irvine City
Council to allow a reform initiative in the November 2000 election.
Smith proposed to spend taxpayers' money to file a lawsuit to keep
the initiative off the ballot. Fortunately for him, the initiative
fell short by 89 signatures.</LD>
<LD>   If Smith is sincere about true election reform, he should demand
that all campaign contributions over $1 be reported, along with the
name and city of the contributor. In the last Irvine election,
contributions of less than $100 did not have to be reported. As a
result many pro-airport advocates contributed $99 to some council
candidate without voters' knowledge.</LD>

<HD>Ahmanson Foes Talking Cash and PR With Owner</HD>
<DH>Development: Coalition believes it can persuade Washington
Mutual that its biggest gains could be made by never breaking ground
on the project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a publicity war continues over the Ahmanson Ranch project,
opponents of the 3,050-home Ventura County development are quietly
maneuvering to buy the ranch by delivering a package of cash and tax
breaks that owner Washington Mutual Bank could find hard to resist.</LD>
<LD>   "We're helping Washington Mutual realize what the out is for them,
that there are good financial options," said Chad Griffin, director
of a high-profile campaign to block construction of the controversial
$2-billion golf course community overlooking the west San Fernando
Valley.</LD>
<LD>   "We're talking to some of the nation's top experts in structuring
these types of deals," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The newly formed Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch coalition,
co-chaired by actor-director Rob Reiner, has asked top executives at
Washington Mutual to discuss the financial and public relations
benefit of selling the 2,800-acre property to the public, or turning
it over to a land conservation agency.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual, which inherited the project after buying H. F.
Ahmanson Co. in 1998, has insisted that the old cattle and sheep
ranch near Calabasas is not for sale, and that construction will
begin next year.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent statement, the Seattle-based savings and loan
suggested it had considered, and rejected, federal tax breaks through
so-called conservation easements as an alternative to development.</TE>
<TE>   "Our investors put greater weight on cash earnings than on tax
benefits," bank spokesman Tim McGarry said. "That and our belief that
this project meets a need for new housing makes building it
preferable to opting for conservation easements."</TE>
<TE>   However, Washington Mutual offered last month to have a
consultant, former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, meet with the
coalition "as a first step toward meaningful discussions."</TE>
<TE>   "Following that meeting," bank Chief Executive Kerry Killinger
wrote in a letter to Reiner, "I would be happy to meet with you
personally provided that Secretary Babbitt concludes that it would be
constructive."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents consider a Babbitt meeting window dressing. But in a
letter Thursday, they agreed to meet with him if that will lead to
discussions with Killinger.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to meet with lobbyists hired by the developer,"
Griffin said.</TE>
<TE>   Approved by Ventura County in 1992, the Ahmanson Ranch project was
stalled first by a series of lawsuits and is now being held up by
studies of whether a rare frog and plant discovered on the ranch can
survive if it is built.</TE>
<TE>   Delays have even prompted some who support the project to question
its future.</TE>
<TE>   Architect Donald Brackenbush, designer of the Ahmanson Ranch
development and president of Ahmanson Land Co. until 1997, said he
thinks Washington Mutual might consider a sale because of the
potential for even more delays and the beating the bank's image is
taking from project opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "If the opposition wrote a check and went up to Seattle and
explained to the [bank] administration what the risks are down here,
I think they would probably have an interesting conversation,"
Brackenbush said. "It's a different program now. It's Hollywood and
money, and I don't know how you deal with that."</TE>
<TE>   Developer Fred Maas, who helped cut the deal that led to the
county's approval of the project a decade ago, said he thinks it is
virtually dead in its present form.</TE>
<TE>   "Given current thinking and conduct, it is unlikely it will ever
be built," said Maas, who is constructing a project twice the size of
Ahmanson Ranch in San Diego. "I think they need to be realistic. This
is a formidable group of opponents, and they're hiring [high-quality]
lawyers to litigate. How many more years could it be tied up? I think
they should be looking out of the box, for new options."</TE>
<TE>   Tax Breaks as a Conservation Tool</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles County developer familiar with federal tax breaks
granted for gifts of valuable parkland said: "The real question is
why Washington Mutual has its heels dug in? Why doesn't it become a
hero by dedicating a park? It could get an appraisal of $500 million,
and that's no stretch. Then write it down dollar for dollar on its
taxes."</TE>
<TE>   That is a viable option, experts say, since across the U.S. such
easements are an increasingly popular tax device used by large
landowners.</TE>
<TE>   Boston tax attorney Stephen Small, who wrote the 1980 Internal
Revenue Service code that allows such breaks, said corporations need
only prove their gifts have a "significant conservation value" to
qualify for a write-down of up to 10% of their taxable income.</TE>
<TE>   "Any large landowner would potentially qualify," Small said.
"We've done a lot of conservation easements on ranches in the West."</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual could make full use of the tax break because the
corporation, with $243 million in assets, reported net earnings last
year of $3.1 billion. So it could potentially write off more than
$300 million a year and do that until the market value of the gift is
reached.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual won't confirm the value of Ahmanson Ranch, but
sources close to the project said its net value was appraised at $300
million a decade ago, and was valued at more than double that after
Washington Mutual acquired it.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the Ahmanson Ranch project contracted Small for
advice last week, he said. And he said he told them conservation
easements might be a good fit.</TE>
<TE>   "Important open space in an urban area could certainly work," he
said. "Valuations are tricky because it's a development project, but
it is possible to get from here to there."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren used conservation easements to
his benefit last fall when signing over development rights on 11,000
acres of open space in Orange County. Experts said he could reap
hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks.</TE>
<TE>   Another Ahmanson Ranch opponent, Democratic state Sen. Sheila
Kuehl, who represents neighborhoods near the project, said she is
focusing on a strict buyout of Washington Mutual. Part of $4.7
billion in state park bonds approved since 2000 could be used, she
said, and additional funds could be raised from conservation agencies
and private donors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's interesting how money comes together when you have a willing
seller," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But the ranch's value, Kuehl insisted, falls far short of what
Washington Mutual would likely demand if it agreed to sell.</TE>
<TE>   "They value the land very high, based on its worth to develop,"
she said. "But whether they are [ever] able to build is a different
question."</TE>
<TE>   Deal Would Require Creativity</TE>
<TE>   Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica
Mountains Conservancy, has bought huge tracks of the Santa Monica
Mountains for the state. And he said he thinks a deal could be cut if
Washington Mutual were willing to negotiate.</TE>
<TE>   "Every morning I wake up thinking, 'Wouldn't it be great if the
Ahmanson Ranch were open space,'" he said. "Somewhere in between
certain [high and low] prices there's an opportunity for creativity."</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit Nature Conservancy, a principal in the Irvine Co.
easement deal, might be worth bringing into the debate, Edmiston
said.</TE>
<TE>   The discussion of Washington Mutual's options comes as Ventura
County officials consider a new environmental study that concludes
the dime-sized white spineflower and a red-legged frog discovered on
the ranch in 1999 can survive urbanization in preserves planned by
developers.</TE>
<TE>   Despite what the Ventura County Board of Supervisors decides later
this year, a new round of lawsuits is likely.</TE>
<TE>   And opponents are working hard to persuade Washington Mutual's top
executives that it is time to abandon its development plans.</TE>
<TE>   Pressing the attack during the last two weeks, opponents say they
picketed 20 of the bank's 400 regional branches--the first volley of
a planned six-month effort--and chartered a bus to ferry 40 opponents
to the bank's annual shareholders' meeting in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   They say they distributed 800 anti-Ahmanson packets.</TE>
<TE>   And Seattle news reporters mentioned the protests in stories about
Washington Mutual's earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual, meanwhile, is leaving little doubt about its
position.</TE>
<TE>   "The opposition loves to magnify their impact," McGarry said. "But
they have not been nearly as successful as they would have you
believe.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of NIMBY issue just doesn't travel well.</TE>
<TE>   "We're committed to taking this all the way," he added. "As we see
it, the odds are very much in our favor, and we just need to hold
steady to win."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Taking Sting Out of Fire Ant Invasion</HD>
<DH>Insects: The two-year battle has gone so well that
officials are now talking eradication.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's war on the red imported fire ant is yielding
promising results, with the vast majority of infested sites that have
received the full chemical barrage testing clean and the number of
new reported colonies falling.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the two-year, multimillion-dollar battle has gone so well
that authorities say the county may be able to accomplish what few
experts thought possible: eradication of the fast-moving, resilient
pest that can take over entire neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   "We're kicking their rear," said Richard Bowen, program manager
for the Orange County Fire Ant Authority. "But we've got a long way
to go."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, while 94% of the sites that have been treated for a year
with chemical birth control are now ant-free, there are still 21,768
colonies that are at some stage of the process.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Bowen said the state's budget crunch could threaten
his agency's funding. In February, the Legislative Analyst's Office
suggested cutting $8 million that 11 county ant-control programs
statewide are expected to receive in the next fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County is at the heart of California's fire ant invasion,
which landed in the state in late 1997 on nursery stock and beehives
from the South.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike in the South, especially Texas, where the infestation
is out of control, California's dry climate has helped contain the
ants' spread. Fire ants need moisture to survive and reproduce.</TE>
<TE>   A computer analysis of Orange County's ant colonies shows that 98%
of new sites are found within a mile of existing ones.</TE>
<TE>   "In California's case, the lesson may be that if you get on it
fast and you do a great job in surveying where they are, you've got a
chance to get rid of it," said Dave Williams, a fire ant researcher
with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "If you twiddle your thumbs for four or five years before you
attack, it's going to get away from you.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say whether [Orange County] will be able to completely
eradicate it. But I'd say that you're on the right track."</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, the number of new ant colonies in the county has
steadily declined--from 2,642 discoveries in August to 79 last month,
a drop that isn't entirely due to weather.</TE>
<TE>   That number is less than half what was reported in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the newest finds are in wetlands, away from residential
areas.</TE>
<TE>   That's good news too, because a single ant colony can contain more
than 300,000 aggressive, stinging and biting ants.</TE>
<TE>   Bowen said his agency hasn't taken a report of a human sting or
bite in nine months. In the summer of 2000, he was getting one report
a week.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we're not finding them in backyards like we used to ...
people think that the fire ants are gone because they're not seeing
them," Bowen said. "But they're still out there."</TE>
<TE>   And the search continues.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking everywhere--all of Orange County," said Kelly
Pinion, a zone coordinator for the fire ant authority.</TE>

<TE>   Each morning, Pinion sets traps--a basket with a corn chip in
it--30 feet apart. After lunch, he returns to see if the chips have
attracted fire ants. Each month, the county sets out more than 4,000
traps.</TE>
<TE>   When a new colony is found, treatment begins. Every 90 days for a
year, workers driving an "ant killing machine"--a golf cart--spread
an infested area with a granular chemical that's picked up by worker
ants and brought back to queens. The chemical sterilizes them.</TE>
<TE>   So far, it seems to work. Ann Rommel is hoping it will work for
her.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Rommel noticed a "pile of funny dirt" in the front yard
of her Coto de Caza home. Two weeks later, three more piles had
appeared.</TE>
<TE>   "It was clear we had a problem," she said. "Something was growing
out there."</TE>
<TE>   She did the potato chip trick, bagged some ants and called the
fire ant authority, which will soon send the golf cart out to engage
the enemy on Rommel's lawn.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unsightly, but it's not something I'm going to worry about,"
Rommel said. "The ants I can handle. I'd rather get rid of all the
rabbits. They're as cute as can be, but they eat all my flowers.
They're the problem."</TE>

<HD>10 Authors Honored With Times Book Prizes</HD>
<DH>Writing: Among the winners are Edmund Morris, Tillie Olsen
and Barbara Ehrenreich.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edmund Morris' second volume on Theodore Roosevelt, tracing his two
tumultuous terms as president, was awarded the 2001 Los Angeles Times
Book Prize for biography Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   "Theodore Rex" is the sequel to Morris' 1979 Pulitzer
Prize-winning book, "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt." Its title
refers to the nickname Henry James coined because of Roosevelt's
imperial manner.</LD>
<LD>   "Reading this book is like taking off on a galloping horse," the
Times judges said. "Edmund Morris' prose has his subject's energy and
drive, as well as his authority, and the pace never flags."</LD>
<TE>   Morris was presented the prize, a commendation and $1,000 at a
public ceremony at UCLA's Royce Hall as part of the 2002 Los Angeles
Times Festival of Books.</TE>
<TE>   The prizes reward excellence in nine categories to books published
in 2001, including fiction, poetry and mysteries/thrillers. Each
category is judged by three notable writers from the genre.</TE>
<TE>   Tillie Olsen, one of the earliest spokeswomen for the feminist
movement, was presented the Robert Kirsch Award for having
"distinguished herself not only as an author, editor and teacher, but
also as a political activist."</TE>
<TE>   The Kirsch Award, named for The Times' literary critic from 1954
to 1980, is given annually to recognize the body of work of a writer
living in or writing about the American West.</TE>
<TE>   The prize recognizes Olsen as "a maker of loud and unusual noises,
a bringer of light and air, a giver of hope, an exemplar of the hard
work that a writer must be prepared to do, and the life that such a
writer must be willing to lead."</TE>
<TE>   A Highlight of Weekend Times Festival of Books</TE>
<TE>   Other prize winners were:</TE>
<TE>   * Barbara Ehrenreich, in current interest, for "Nickel and Dimed:
On (Not) Getting By in America," published by Metropolitan Books,
imprint of Henry Holt and Co. The judges said this true tale of the
working poor "rises to a singular importance in subject matter, depth
and clarity of concern."</TE>
<TE>   * Mary Robison, in fiction, for "Why Did I Ever," published by
Counterpoint. The judges said that "Robison rebels against form,
challenges stifling social orders and paints a dark and moving
portrait of a woman whose mere survival is nothing short of
miraculous."</TE>
<TE>   * Rick Perlstein, in history, for "Before the Storm:
Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus," published
by the Hill and Wang Division of Farrar, Straus and Giroux. This
portrait of the conservative grass-roots movement is "a beautifully
written and compelling narrative" and "an exemplary work of
historical scholarship," the judges said.</TE>
<TE>   * T. Jefferson Parker, in mystery/thriller, for "Silent Joe,"
published by Hyperion. The judges agreed that this, Parker's ninth
crime novel, is "a gripping book as moving as it is hard-edged" and
"a 'career best.'"</TE>
<TE>   * Anne Carson, in poetry, for "The Beauty of the Husband: A
Fictional Essay in 29 Tangos," published by Alfred A. Knopf. The
judges lauded "a work of radical beauty" of "an ingenious form that
brings narrative force to bear on language so precise that its
devastated lyricism guides readers straight into the heart of their
own unguarded desires."</TE>
<TE>   * Richard Hamblyn, in science and technology, for "The Invention
of Clouds: How an Amateur Meteorologist Forged the Language of the
Skies," published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. The judges said, "In
prose of exceptional elegance, Richard Hamblyn tells the tale of this
founding father of meteorology, embedding his story of an emerging
science in a wide-ranging and rich cultural matrix."</TE>
<TE>   * Mildred D. Taylor, in young adult fiction, for "The Land,"
published by Phyllis Fogelman Books (Penguin Putnam). The judges
said, "Her distinguished historical fiction resonates with powerful
images of who we are and what we believe about ourselves, both as
individuals and as a nation."</TE>
<TE>   The Art Seidenbaum Award for First Fiction, named for the founder
of the book prize program, who served as Times book editor from 1978
to 1985, was presented to Rachel Seiffert for "The Dark Room,"
published by Pantheon Books.</TE>
<TE>   The judges said, "Taken together, these three unsentimental and
spare narratives contribute to an ever-deepening understanding of
Germany's tormented history over the last century, suggesting that no
single account will ever suffice, no one version of events can
authenticate or make real the evil from which a nation and world may
never recover."</TE>

<HD>Making Book on Diversity of Ideas</HD>
<DH>Festival: Thousands crowd the UCLA campus to hear authors
and panels of interest. The Times-sponsored event continues today.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From hip-hop to Hanoi, there were topics for every reader Saturday at
the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books.</LD>
<LD>   "It makes you realize how many different genres are out there,"
said Phoebe Prather, 22, a UC Santa Cruz student. She attended the
festival with her mother, Nancy, 54, who drove 250 miles from Lone
Pine in Owens Valley to hear mystery writers and other panel
speakers.</LD>
<LD>   The Prathers were among thousands who converged on the UCLA
campus, crowding into lecture halls to hear their favorite authors
and gathering beneath white tents to browse through seemingly endless
rows of books, magazines and videos.</LD>
<TE>   The event, which drew 120,000 last year, runs through today, and
features 375 authors and 95 panel discussions on an array of issues,
including writing history, the Los Angeles riots, criminal minds and
Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday afternoon, hundreds packed Royce Hall to listen to Ray
Bradbury, author of "Fahrenheit 451" and more than 30 other books.
Mayor James K. Hahn, who introduced Bradbury, selected "Fahrenheit
451" to promote his "One Book, One City" campaign, an effort to
encourage civic pride and literacy.</TE>
<TE>   "We turned this city into one single book club," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   City officials, who borrowed the idea from Chicago and Seattle,
wanted to choose a book that spoke to Angelenos, Hahn said. They
settled on Bradbury's book because it allowed "people to question
authority and question long-standing beliefs," the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   "Fahrenheit 451" is a science fiction book about censorship and
rebellion. It was written on typewriters in the UCLA library in 1953,
in nine days.</TE>
<TE>   Set in a future world in which the written word is forbidden and
firefighters burn books, the book recently topped The Times
bestseller list.</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury, 81, who wore thick black-rimmed glasses, a navy blue
suit and a colorful tie, spoke to the packed auditorium as he sat in
a wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   "The secret of everything is being in love," he told the audience.
"I fell in love with so many things growing up that they became a
part of my life later on."</TE>
<TE>   He loved magicians, comic strips, King Kong, 20,000 Leagues Under
the Sea" and King Tut--all of which came through in his writing in
some form later in life, Bradbury said.</TE>
<TE>   He spoke about living in Venice for $30 a month rent, not knowing
where his next check would come from and cramming to read Herman
Melville after being offered a chance to write the screenplay for
"Moby-Dick."</TE>
<TE>   Joyce Nelson, 54, of Pasadena said she enjoyed Bradbury's message
because it made her think about her own daughter, a jewelry maker.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson said she was not happy about her daughter's choice of a
career. But hearing Bradbury speak made her think twice.</TE>
<TE>   "It is what she loves to do," Nelson said. "You basically have to
listen to your heart and what's inside for you."</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn Jones, 47, of Los Angeles brought her 7-year-old daughter
along to expose her to African American writers.</TE>
<TE>   The pair stretched to look over a throng of hundreds who had
gathered to hear poet and writer Maya Angelou on an outdoor stage.
Jones said she was looking forward to a panel discussion on African
American novelists.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what walk of life you're from, no matter what your
financial situation, there is something here for everyone to enjoy,"
Jones said. She also was pleased that the event provided free
entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Political topics arose in panels such as "The Time Machine:
Writing History," where Julian Jackson, author of "France: The Dark
Years, 1940-1944," talked about the far-right candidate Jean-Marie Le
Pen, who has been accused of neo-fascism and racism, winning the
first round of presidential elections last week.</TE>
<TE>   "Here is a leader who makes jokes about the Holocaust, who makes
anti-Semitic jokes," Jackson said. "Here we have a resurgence of the
past in the present.... The demons of the past are lurking, not only
in France, but in Europe."</TE>
<TE>   In a panel discussion on "Vietnam: The Country Not the War," Gen.
Nguyen Cao Ky, who was premier and vice president of the Republic of
South Vietnam from 1965 to 1967, spoke about moving on from the past.</TE>
<TE>   "Vietnam is still a love and hate affair," he said. "It's time we
just forget about the past.... It is time to build a new bridge
between America and Vietnam."</TE>
<TE>   Jenny Fox, 81, and Joyce Willing, 60, both of Granada Hills,
wandered into a discussion about hip-hop by Russell Simmons, author
of "Life and Def: Sex Drugs, Money and God," just as he was
explaining the rise of Curtis Blow and Public Enemy.</TE>
<TE>   Willing, who is not a hip-hop fan, said she didn't understand the
context or history, but she was interested when Simmons said young
people use rap and spoken-word poetry to face their problems today.</TE>
<TE>   Phoebe Prather said the diversity of the festival is the most
important part.</TE>
<TE>   "It helps build tolerance levels of people who are different," she
said. "You can be other people, be other places [when you read]."</TE>
<TE>   Her mother added that this is the third year the two have come to
the festival, and given the outstanding turnout, it appears society's
love of reading is still alive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so easy not to read any more. You can get information from
other media sources and TV," she said. "This makes you realize [that]
print isn't losing its place."</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Police said Saturday that they are following several tips in the
reported disappearance of a 2-year-old boy from a public park.</LD>
<LD>   Jahi Turner was reported missing by his stepfather, Tieray Jones,
23, who said the boy disappeared Thursday while he left him alone for
15 minutes to get a soft drink.</LD>
<LD>   Police are seeking a woman reported by Jones to have been in the
park at the same time.</LD>
<TE>   After an all-day search Friday that included tracker dogs and a
helicopter, police said they are classifying the case as a kidnapping
because they believe a toddler could not have wandered beyond the
search area.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's mother, Tameka Jones, 18, is an enlisted sailor who was
at sea when the boy was reported missing. She was brought back to San
Diego by helicopter to aid in the search. The boy had arrived in San
Diego on April 21 after living with his maternal grandmother in
Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Jahi is a light-skinned African American. He was reported wearing
a long-sleeve blue shirt with a Winnie the Pooh design and a brand of
Michael Jordan sneakers.</TE>

<HD>Safer Railroad Braking System Delayed by Cost, Technical
Concerns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The technology has been around for nearly two decades.</LD>
<LD>   An automatic braking system can link passenger and freight trains
to rail side warning signals, triggering an emergency stop if trains
are on a collision course.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to improving safety, the technology could boost
railroad efficiency as much as 30%, allowing trains to travel faster
and closer together.</LD>
<TE>   Federal officials investigating Tuesday's fatal crash of a freight
train and Metrolink commuter train in Placentia said the accident
would have been prevented had the system been in place.</TE>
<TE>   But the rail industry and federal officials who regulate the rails
have resisted, saying the $3-billion cost is too high. Moreover, they
say the technology has problems.</TE>
<TE>   Metrolink officials agree, even after Tuesday's crash.</TE>
<TE>   "There are an incredibly complicated set of issues that still need
to be addressed with this technology," said Metrolink spokesman
Francisco Oaxaca.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the resistance, only two U.S. rail lines have the
braking systems, to the frustration of regulators who have been
calling for their mandatory use nationwide since the mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "Tuesday's accident was another one where not having this was a
factor," said Keith Holloway, a spokesman for the National
Transportation Safety Board. "When it keeps coming back up again and
again that this could have been an issue in accidents, we need to
address it."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators believe the Placentia crash was caused when the crew
of a Burlington Northern Santa Fe freight train ran past two warning
signals, plowing into the double-decker passenger train. Two
passengers died and more than 100 were injured. The freight engineer
told Placentia police he couldn't see the signals because the morning
sun blinded him.</TE>
<TE>   The NTSB--which handles safety investigations for the federal
government, but lacks regulatory authority--has pressured the Federal
Railroad Administration for years to require the automatic brakes.
Yet rail administration officials maintain the cost must come down
before they can force companies to use it. The rail industry hopes to
create a system compatible across U.S. rail lines. Such tests have
been going on for at least 15 years, and at one time included a pilot
program in Southern California with Burlington Northern Santa Fe.</TE>
<TE>   A central question in the debate is whether spending money on the
computerized brakes is the best way to save lives. Only a fraction of
train accidents are the result of train-on-train collisions. Most are
caused by cars stuck at road crossings or pedestrians on the tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "It is difficult to put a value on human lives, but to a certain
extent the railroad industry has begun to do that," said Tom
Sullivan, an Oakland-based transportation technology consultant. "In
this case, it costs them about $3 [million] to $5 million a life to
install these systems."</TE>
<TE>   Railroad companies say they are waiting for the signaling industry
to produce "off the shelf'" products that would make the technology
cheaper and able to be used compatible across their rail networks.</TE>
<TE>   "What good is it if a locomotive from L.A. won't work when it
interchanges onto an eastern railway?" said Warren Flatau, spokesman
for the Federal Railroad Administration. "Those things are being
worked out. It takes time to build consensus."</TE>
<TE>   So in the age of cell phones and Palm Pilots, train operators
continue to rely on technology rooted in the 19th century. And the
industry sees no reason for immediate change, citing few train
collisions.</TE>
<TE>   The computerized brakes are in place only on a high-speed Amtrak
corridor in the Northeast and an Amtrak line in Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Tests on a commuter line in New Jersey and a freight line in
Alaska are expected to begin soon.</TE>
<TE>   But the most widely anticipated test will take place in Illinois,
where the railroad industry and government agencies are spending $35
million to install a satellite-linked braking system on 123 miles of
track shared by freight and passenger trains.</TE>
<TE>   Trains on that track will be equipped with computers linked to a
satellite system and the railroad operations center. If the train is
on a collision course, an alarm will sound in time for conductors to
stop the trains. If they do not, and a crash appears imminent, the
computer stops the train. Dispatchers will know the location of every
train within a meter.</TE>
<TE>   The system also will sense whether a train is going too fast for
track conditions and will slow it down. The computer can sense the
train's location in relation to railroad track workers and will be
able to warn the conductor and the workers.</TE>
<TE>   Trains currently run on a "block" system in which no more than one
train can be on a section of track. Signal lights tell engineers when
to yield to trains ahead of them. This has caused long delays on
tracks shared by freight and commuter trains.</TE>
<TE>   Under the automated system, delays would be reduced because
computer monitoring allows trains to travel closer together, said
Francesco Pellegrino a scientist with Lockheed Martin, which was
contracted to build the equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Trains also would be permitted to exceed the 79 mph federal speed
limit and go as fast as 110 mph.</TE>
<TE>   The industry fears investing in technology that may flop. Tom
White, a spokesman for the American Assn. of Railroads, says freight
companies have experimented with more than a dozen variations of
positive control and continue to see flaws. "It can be more
complicated than you think," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the NTSB continues to send letters to the railroad
administration expressing its disappointment that the braking systems
have not been mandated. The board put the systems on its "most
wanted" list in 1990, where they remain today.</TE>
<TE>   A letter the board sent to the rail administration in June put it
bluntly: "Without the installation of [the] systems, preventable
collision accidents will continue to occur."</TE>

<HD>Bush to Campaign for Simon in State</HD>
<DH>Politics: President's visit is an effort to provide
financial as well as moral support to man who was his second choice
in Republican primary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When President Bush was scouting for a Republican candidate to
challenge Gov. Gray Davis, conservative Bill Simon Jr. was not the
kind he had in mind.</LD>
<LD>   Bush preferred a moderate, and his first choice was Richard
Riordan.</LD>
<LD>   But eight weeks after Simon clobbered Riordan in the GOP primary,
Bush is due to arrive in California on Monday to make amends.</LD>
<TE>   As the star attraction of Simon fund-raisers Monday night in Los
Angeles and Tuesday in the Silicon Valley, Bush is expected to raise
more than $3 million for the Republican nominee.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big financial shot in the arm," said Simon strategist Sal
Russo. "It demonstrates to anyone who's foolishly a doubter that the
president is totally committed to this race."</TE>
<TE>   However firm the president's commitment ends up being, it will
have as much to do with Bush's prospects for reelection as it does
with the governor's race.</TE>
<TE>   A Simon victory in November would be a huge boost to a Bush
reelection effort. California's governor--a magnet for TV cameras and
campaign donations--can put the machinery of incumbency to work for a
president.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Simon were to lose by a narrow margin, Democrats could be
shaken enough that in 2004, they would dump money into California
that otherwise would flow to Florida, Michigan or other presidential
battleground states.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Al Gore was able to spend nothing in California, yet
defeat Bush by 1.3 million votes. Despite his wartime popularity,
analysts said, Bush still faces an uphill struggle to win California
in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd love to have California in play and win California, but
I'm kind of skeptical about their ability to do so," said Stuart
Rothenberg, who publishes a nonpartisan political newsletter in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's approval rating in California--as in the rest of the
country--has soared since Sept. 11. A Times poll in January found 75%
of California voters approved of his job performance.</TE>
<TE>   "If the election were held today, he'd win in a landslide," said
state Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga.</TE>
<TE>   But Democrats outnumber Republicans in California, 45% to 35%. All
but one of California's statewide elected officials are Democrats.
Democrats control both houses of the Legislature and dominate the
state's congressional delegation.</TE>
<TE>   So to win in California, Bush, like Simon, must draw support from
Democrats and independents. And to do so, he must overcome some of
the same obstacles that face Simon.</TE>
<TE>   To start, both oppose abortion rights and gun control. Those
positions put Bush and Simon at odds with most voters in the state
and provide opponents two major lines of attack.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Simon also support vouchers to send children to private
schools at taxpayer expense--another issue that California voters
have opposed and that Davis has used to hammer Simon for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   And Bush and Simon have ties to the oil industry that heighten
their vulnerability on the environment--a touchstone issue among
California moderates.</TE>
<TE>   For Bush, overcoming those liabilities could require both success
in the war and sustained improvement in the economy, said political
scientist Larry N. Gerston of San Jose State.</TE>
<TE>   "If the economy is moving well, people are more forgiving on a lot
of those issues," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats and independents in recent California focus groups have
praised Bush's handling of the war, but still see him as a "daddy's
boy, not very smart, not very articulate--all that stuff," said
Democratic strategist Bill Carrick.</TE>
<TE>   "If he's really popular nationwide, he's going to be popular here,
but less so," Carrick said. "If he's unpopular nationwide, he'll be
more so here."</TE>
<TE>   Bush advisors expect the president's approval ratings to drift
downward and level off. But because of his response to the Sept. 11
attacks, they said, Bush can compete in 2004 from a stronger
foundation in Democratic states like California.</TE>
<TE>   "Voters' perception of the president has been fundamentally
altered," said White House pollster Matthew Dowd.</TE>
<TE>   To win California, Bush and Simon must gain support among two
crucial voting blocs: Latinos and moderate suburban women. Bush has
appealed to both by stressing his support for school reforms, a
tactic adopted by Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has taken pains to appeal to Latinos and other minorities,
albeit with limited success. Immigration reform has been high on
Bush's agenda as president. Monday, he will visit South-Central Los
Angeles on the 10th anniversary of the riots.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, however, has focused less on minority outreach. On Cesar
Chavez Day this month, Simon ignored the occasion; the Democratic
governor celebrated with Latinos at a school in East Los Angeles. It
has been five weeks since Simon's last campaign stop targeting Latino
voters.</TE>
<TE>   The absence of a major effort by Simon to reach beyond his
conservative base has worried some GOP leaders. Several privately
have acknowledged losing confidence in him as Davis has managed to
define the campaign's focus, most recently by attacking Simon for
refusing to release his tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   Simon "is a little bit off balance right now, but he's got time to
catch up," said Ken Khachigian, a veteran GOP strategist.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if the election were held right now, Simon would be very
close to Davis, but I'm not so sure we'd win today," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Simon's campaign will get a lift from the Bush fund-raisers
Monday night in Century City and Tuesday in Santa Clara. With six
months until election day, the events offer Simon a media platform
before a public that is paying little attention to the race.</TE>
<TE>   But it is far from clear that Bush's popularity will rub off on
Simon. In November, candidates for governor of New Jersey and
Virginia lost despite the president's support.</TE>
<TE>   It also is unclear whether Bush will steer substantial resources
to Simon in the fall when Republicans will be fully engaged in the
fight to regain control of the Senate and keep a GOP majority in the
House.</TE>
<TE>   What Simon needs most, at least now, is money. Bush's visit will
produce a windfall in that regard, but leave Simon far short of the
more than $30 million he needs to run a strong race against Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Simon spent nearly all of the $9.7 million he raised for the
primary--$5.5 million of it from his family's fortune, the rest from
outside donors.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he has been slow to attract big-money donations, but
key Bush supporters have begun to help out. The chief organizer of
Simon's Silicon Valley luncheon is venture capitalist E. Floyd
Kvamme, a Bush technology advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Leading the fund-raising team in Los Angeles is investment banker
Bradford M. Freeman, a Bush friend who was instrumental in securing
White House support for Riordan, but switched with the president to
Simon.</TE>
<TE>   As Simon made the rounds on conservative radio talk shows last
week, he touted Bush's visit as a major coup. On KMJ in Fresno, he
recalled that Bush assured him during a recent Oval Office meeting
that he would stump for Simon in California "a number of times"
before the Nov. 5 election.</TE>

<HD>Bishop Gives Police Names of 20 Priests</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bishop of San Bernardino has given police the names of 20 priests
accused of sexually abusing minors, including four men still active
in the diocese, after reviewing clergy files dating back 50 years.</LD>
<LD>   The diocese will not publicly disclose the names of the four
active priests, but has assured that they are not working near
children, said the Rev. Howard Lincoln, diocese spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   Altogether, he said, the diocese reported 22 allegations involving
20 priests to the San Bernardino Police Department's sex crimes unit.
Four of those 20 priests are dead, one has left the country and
another 11 are retired or part of a religious order not directly
under the control of the bishop, Lincoln said.</LD>
<TE>   Gerald R. Barnes, the bishop of San Bernardino, recently ordered
more than 400 files of current and former priests checked for
allegations of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes, who oversees the nation's 12th largest diocese, with 145
priests and 1 million baptized Catholics, decided the extensive
review was necessary because of the current allegations that have
rocked the church nationwide, Lincoln said. The diocese includes San
Bernardino and Riverside counties.</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino police Det. Gordon Jones said three detectives are
reviewing the files and plan to distribute them to appropriate law
enforcement agencies. "We are just beginning to go through the
documents," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One name not among those given to police was the Rev. Paul
Shanley, Lincoln said. Shanley, who is accused of molesting children
dating back to 1967 in the Boston Archdiocese, was transferred to the
San Bernardino diocese in 1990 with no warning of past allegations.
Lincoln said no one in the San Bernardino diocese has come forward
with an allegation against Shanley.</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino diocese officials also found the names of six
priests whose allegations have been resolved, Lincoln said.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Ed Ball was convicted in 1992 and 2001 of child
molestation and is serving three years in prison, Lincoln said, and
the Rev. Anthony Rodrigues was dismissed from the priesthood in the
1980s after a similar conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln said another of the six priests was convicted in 1987 of
child molestation and left the country. Three other priests were
cleared of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Since the mid-1990s, Lincoln said, "the diocese has never given a
second chance for any priest who molested a child."</TE>

<HD>Long Day's Night at Music Festival</HD>
<DH>Culture: Tens of thousands do a lot of waiting at desert
event, but payoff is 50 acts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIO, Calif.</DL>
<LD>For the tens of thousands of fans who trekked to this small desert
town Saturday for the third annual Coachella Music &amp; Arts Festival,
the eclectic fare was worth the wait--which is saying a lot.</LD>
<LD>   Long lines in traffic, long lines at the gate and long lines at
every vending stand tested the patience of even the hardiest fans at
the first installment of the two-day festival.</LD>
<LD>   The payoff was a lineup of 50 acts representing music strains
ranging from old-fashioned guitar rock to the audio alchemy of DJs
from Europe's electronic dance scene, along with gorgeous weather and
the pleasant grassy venue of the vast Empire Polo Fields.</LD>
<TE>   Attendance figures were unavailable at press time, but local
police officials said a survey of the venue's parking lots at midday
suggested that the first-day show would easily surpass last year's
single-day total of 30,000. Police reported no major incidents or
significant arrests as the sun began to set on the mountain-ringed
site.</TE>
<TE>   Crowd favorites during the daylight hours included
singer-songwriter Pete Yorn on the main stage and Cornershop, a
British duo that melds Indian traditions and electronic
sensibilities. The nighttime sets certain to draw major interest were
headliners Bjork and the Chemical Brothers, while today's bill
includes Oasis, the Strokes and the Foo Fighters.</TE>
<TE>   The third edition of Coachella also appears to mark a turning
point for the franchise. The festival was launched with an eye toward
importing the European model of a huge standing festival with
eclectic sounds that defy radio popularity. The first festival ended
up in the red, and last year's staging was more or less a break-even
proposition, according to Paul Tollett, a partner for promoter
Goldenvoice.</TE>
<TE>   "This year," Tollett said Saturday, "we will make a profit."</TE>
<TE>   More important to fans was the simple proposition of a good time.</TE>
<TE>   The 80-acre venue was packed with young people, many dancing, many
lolling back in the warm sun and sounds. This year's bill lacked the
sure-fire huge crowd pleaser that had led the previous two festivals
(such as Rage Against the Machine and Jane's Addiction), but most
fans were happy to track down favored obscure acts and imported DJs.</TE>
<TE>   Among those fans was Chaly 2na, the lanky front man of Jurassic 5,
the celebrated Los Angeles hip-hop collective. Between his fights
through traffic ("It was awful," he said) and his group's set, 2na
was thrilled to shuttle between stages to sample exotic sonic
flavors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always a treat to have an outlet for creativity, especially
one like this," 2na said. "A lot of pop culture nowadays seems
anti-creativity. So this is beautiful. The mix of it all: It's a
wonderful thing to see and hear."</TE>

<HD>Idyllwild Area Parched by Worst Drought in 70 Years</HD>
<DH>Resources: Mandatory water restrictions are imposed as
ground-water table drops and reservoir lake is down 90%, to the depth
of a wading pond.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SULLIVAN BRENNAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>IDYLLWILD</DL>
<LD>Fog swirling around lofty pines gives an unmistakable impression of
lushness here. But beneath the surface lies a different picture--of
the mountains' water evaporating amid what officials call the worst
local drought in 70 years.</LD>
<LD>   The ground-water table is dropping, a reservoir lake has dried to
the depth of a wading pond and local water agencies have imposed
mandatory water restrictions in this mountain town of 2,000.</LD>
<LD>   "I have never seen or experienced four years of so little rainfall
and snowpack in a row," said Jerry Holldber, general manager of the
Pine Cove County Water District, one of three small districts that
serve the community.</LD>
<TE>   This year has been the driest on record here since 1929, said Jim
Ludy, controller of the Idyllwild Water District. It also has been
the only period to produce four consecutive years of drought.</TE>
<TE>   "Any little bit of moisture, any, we just pray for it," Barbara
McCay, a 50-year resident, said as she eyed the fog that descended on
the forest one day recently. "We've had a dry winter, and this summer
is going to be hell."</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the coming months may indeed prove trying, with
tightened water limits and a heightened fire risk.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the area's three water districts has escalated from
voluntary to mandatory water restrictions. These include requiring
residents to immediately repair leaking faucets and plumbing, water
plants only in the early morning or evening hours, and cease draining
and refilling swimming pools.</TE>
<TE>   Signs around town read: "Stage II water restrictions in effect.
Please conserve." The water district offices offer conservation
brochures, and restaurants decline to offer water automatically,
instead posting cards that advise customers to "just ask."</TE>
<TE>   If residents waste water, officials have the authority to double
or triple their water bills, restrict their water flow or shut off
their water entirely, said Thomas Lovejoy, general manager of the
Idyllwild Water District.</TE>
<TE>   Foster Lake, which serves as a reservoir for the Idyllwild Water
District, has dropped from 20 feet to 2 feet. A district crew member
recently watched a long-legged bird walk clear across it, Lovejoy
said. Strawberry Creek, which feeds the water district, previously
ran with trout, but is now padded with dried pine needles.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only are the creeks dry and the lakes dry, but the water
level in our wells is falling," Lovejoy said. "One year ago, the
ground-water level in our main well field was 12 feet below the
surface. It is now 45 feet below the surface."</TE>
<TE>   While the state as a whole is doing fine, with rainfall at 85% of
average, Southern California has seen just 30% of average rainfall
this year, said California state climatologist Bill Mork.</TE>
<TE>   Rainfall in Idyllwild was 8.72 inches as of March 31--about a
third of the year-to-date average of 24 inches. But unlike lowland
areas that sit above porous aquifers and tap the state's extensive
water system, Idyllwild perches on granitic rock that captures
rainwater only in cracks and crevices.</TE>
<TE>   "So we don't have the water resources to draw on like the valley
communities," said George Meyer, an Idyllwild resident and professor
of geology at College of the Desert in Palm Desert. "It's a very,
very, finite resource. We don't have a bank account to draw on; we
don't have a big reservoir."</TE>
<TE>   It's precisely the type of area that is most vulnerable to
drought--small, isolated, rural water systems relying on ground-water
tables stored in fractured rock, said Jeanine Jones, principal
engineer for the state Department of Water Resources. It's also the
type of area that is primed for wildfire, scientists say.</TE>
<TE>   Parched trees are dying throughout the forest as drought saps
their strength and leaves them vulnerable to attacks by pests and
parasites.</TE>
<TE>   The dense trees, dried brush and deadwood raise the risk of forest
fires, officials warn. Although a dry year yields fewer grasses in
which a fire can ignite, it also desiccates logs and trees, which can
fuel an inferno once a fire starts.</TE>
<TE>   Under natural conditions, small frequent fires thin the forest
floor. But a century of fire suppression short-circuited that
process, leaving a tinderbox behind, said Richard Minnich, a
professor of earth sciences at UC Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   "All of these mountain communities have very dense forests, and
are in very big trouble.... The fuel is there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The drought hasn't hurt local businesses, merchants say--so far.</TE>
<TE>   Joel White, owner of the Idyllwild Inn, saw about a 2% drop in
weekend visitors because of the lighter snowfall, but said other
tourists driving up the mountain to beat the desert heat made up much
of the shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   David Agranowitz, owner of the Bread Basket restaurant, said he's
braced for higher water bills but hasn't seen rates rise yet.</TE>
<TE>   State Assemblyman David Kelley (R-Idyllwild), who grows ruby red
grapefruit in nearby Hemet, said farmers are facing higher water
costs and lowered wells. But he added that he has little choice but
to wait for rain.</TE>
<TE>   The drought has at least called attention to water issues,
residents say. The Mountain Resources Conservancy, a local
environmental group, has protested a local water-bottling operation
at springs off Idyllwild's Lily Creek, and called for a mountainwide
water management plan.</TE>
<TE>   "These springs represent, in this life zone, an oasis for very
diverse life that is stressed by drought," said Chuck Stroud, a
steering committee member of the Mountain Resources Conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   "These are cradles of life, and they're very limited--so the
commercial taking of water is extremely inappropriate, and even more
profoundly so in face of this enduring drought."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Black, owner of the bottling company, declined to comment. At
the urging of the group, however, the three local water districts are
forming an areawide water management plan, said Mel Goldfarb,
president of the Idyllwild Water District board.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't create water," he said. "But maybe we can figure out how
we can get water more efficiently."</TE>

<HD>Arrest of Caldwell Surprises Friends</HD>
<DH>Profile: Many say his involvement in Blake case is
unbelievable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earle Caldwell, aspiring country rock guitarist, part-time car stereo
installer and, until two weeks ago, full-time bodyguard and personal
assistant for actor Robert Blake, impressed many people with his
loyalty, reliability and honesty.</LD>
<LD>   He is the person, prosecutors allege, the 68-year-old actor turned
to for help in planning the killing of his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley,
44, and the disposal of her body.</LD>
<LD>   Although Los Angeles police believe Caldwell was out of town on
May 4, 2001, the night Bakley was shot, co-defendant Caldwell was
beside the actor Monday when Blake was arraigned on a murder charge.
Caldwell, 46, is charged with conspiracy in the slaying.</LD>
<TE>   Both men, who have pleaded not guilty, were arrested April 18;
Blake at his daughter's Hidden Hills home and Caldwell near his
Burbank apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, in custody since his arrest, posted $1-million bail for
Caldwell, who was released from jail Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege in court papers that while Blake was plotting
to kill Bakley, Caldwell supplied the actor with a small-caliber
handgun and drew up a list of supplies, which allegedly included two
shovels, a crowbar, old rugs, duct tape and swimming pool acid.</TE>
<TE>   Several of Caldwell's relatives, friends and acquaintances said in
the days since his arrest that his involvement in a murder case seems
unbelievable.</TE>
<TE>   The worst things Caldwell had been accused of previously were
threatening a former girlfriend and waking neighbors with the roar of
his motorcycle at odd hours, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Earle reeks of honesty," said Dan DiPaola of Burbank, who has
known Caldwell nearly 20 years. "If he is lying, it's the first time
I ever heard a lie from him."</TE>
<TE>   DiPaola said Caldwell had called him collect from jail Tuesday and
reported he was "doing OK." He said he was interviewed April 20 by
Los Angeles detectives and told them only positive things about
Caldwell.</TE>
<TE>   DiPaola, 49, who produces high-technology digital sound for the
entertainment industry, met Caldwell through a mutual friend in the
early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   DiPaola and Caldwell worked together on special effects and
designing sets for music videos. They worked on the television
program "Rockin' America," a late-night 1980s music video show.</TE>
<TE>   "Earle has always been one of those hard-working guys who goes to
bed early," DiPaola said. "He wasn't the type to go out with the guys
and have beers."</TE>
<TE>   Friends and relatives said Caldwell's wife lives in San Mateo, a
city of 94,000 about 20 miles south of San Francisco. She declined to
be interviewed for this story.</TE>
<TE>   At Caldwell's mother's home in Millbrae near San Francisco, the
handyman's older sister defended him.</TE>
<TE>   "I've known my brother all of his life and I know he would never
be involved in anything that wasn't right and honest," said Jacqui
Villanueva, 51. "He's a very decent man. I'm so proud of him. I love
and adore him, and so does the rest of his family."</TE>
<TE>   Blake's lawyer, Harland W. Braun, said authorities are trying to
get Caldwell to turn against the actor. "He is accused of a crime,
and they are offering the key to the jail if he makes up a story
against Robert," said Braun, who described Caldwell as "low-key."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the district attorney's office said she could
not confirm or deny whether Caldwell had been offered a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell was born in San Francisco. The family moved to Millbrae,
where Caldwell attended Mills High School. He was active in sports,
particularly pole-vaulting.</TE>
<TE>   His father, Roy, died when Caldwell was a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, Caldwell met Tawn Mastrey, a disc jockey for a San
Francisco radio station.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a jock mentality and was a bit of a macho guy, but he was
very sweet to me," said Mastrey from her sister's home in
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell and Mastrey moved into an apartment in Burlingame, south
of San Francisco, and in 1984 to Studio City.</TE>
<TE>   They were briefly engaged before Mastrey broke off the
relationship. Caldwell, she said, was never violent toward her until
the last day they were together in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   "I was packing, getting ready to leave, and we started talking
about how it wasn't working out and he tried to talk me back,"
Mastrey said. "Then it got ugly.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden he lunged at me, picked me up by my neck and
shirt and forced me against the wall," said Mastrey, now a hard rock
disc jockey in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a scene in a movie. My feet were dangling and kicking
and he was strangling me."</TE>
<TE>   She did not file a police report. But for a year after she moved
away, Mastrey said, Caldwell would leave her threatening messages.</TE>
<TE>   He never harmed her, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Mastrey described Caldwell as a man religiously devoted to working
out.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't seem to have much in the way of material goals or
dreams," said Mastrey, adding that part of Caldwell's attraction
initially was that he was "so normal and not into show business like
me."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Caldwell played electric guitar in country rock banks at
clubs in the San Fernando Valley. Caldwell installed car stereos for
a time, and friends said he and Blake, a client, hit it off the first
time the two met.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Blake hired Caldwell as a handyman and bodyguard,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors in the small complex on San Jose Avenue in Burbank where
Caldwell has lived for the past five years say they were shocked by
his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very pleasant guy," said Jill Kocalis, who has known
Caldwell for four years. "Just a normal dude. Not threatening at all.
He was an active guy, always on the go."</TE>
<TE>   In another apartment of the six-unit complex, Charles Ostergrant
was surprised that Caldwell is charged in a homicide.</TE>
<TE>   "He was quite respectful and very nice," said Ostergrant, adding
that Caldwell had taken to occasionally wearing an American flag on
his jacket after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "He seemed to have a lot of girlfriends, and they were always
pretty and very nice. It's a shock to hear this news," Ostergrant
said.</TE>
<TE>   Another neighbor said Caldwell used to race his turquoise Harley
Davidson up and down the alley.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd race it at 1 o'clock in the morning sometimes, going about
80 mph," said Zelimhan Zaourbekov, 17, a Burbank High School junior.
"He used to wake me up."</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell's landlady, Rosemary Forsyth, called him a "musician and
a great tenant." On Thursday, Caldwell had someone pay his $475
apartment rent for May, even though he was still in custody, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He paid his rent exactly on time," said Forsyth, who rents
Caldwell a one-bedroom apartment. "Everybody there likes Earle."</TE>

<HD>El Toro Airport Lost to a United Suburbia</HD>
<DH>Land use: Quality-of-life concerns rallied more residents

connections.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The hundreds of thousands of residents across Orange County who
battled a commercial airport at El Toro celebrated a common victory
this past week: the triumph of suburbia.</LD>
<LD>   For anti-airport forces, the fate of the former Marine Corps Air
Station--the bulk of which is now headed for limited development and
a park--was all about quality of life. The airport represented much
more than the number of flights per day or decibels per takeoff or
pounds of pollutants. It meant surrendering their sanctuary to the
urban ills of elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   In the process, a political base was created and it matured in
Orange County's sleepy southern half, the side where people drove
home each night, shut the garage door and breathed a sigh of relief.</LD>
<TE>   The El Toro fight was viewed "as a Scud missile attack on the
suburban lifestyle," said Cheryl Katz, who conducts polling for the
Los Angeles Times' Orange County edition and has surveyed public
attitudes on El Toro since 1993, when the base was targeted for
closure.</TE>
<TE>   "People were in fear for their way of life and it got them
motivated to take action in a very primal, territorial way," she
said. "To the [pro-airport] side, it was more of a planning issue.
There wasn't the perceived threat to one's way of life."</TE>
<TE>   It Was a Long Battle, but Victory Came Quickly</TE>
<TE>   As it happened, after eight years of fighting, the triumph by
airport foes came so quickly that anyone out of town for a few weeks
might have missed it.</TE>
<TE>   In rapid succession, Orange County voters on March 5 rezoned the
4,700-acre Marine base for a park, nature preserve and limited
development--discarding airport zoning that was narrowly approved in
1994. County supervisors followed on April 16 by allowing Irvine to
take over the property, ending a county-based planning effort that
consumed more than $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Navy sealed the deal by announcing that it would
sell the property to private owners under Irvine's development plans.</TE>
<TE>   No one is quite sure what will become of the base, other than it
likely won't be an airport. A proposed initiative to restore airport
zoning has until August to qualify for the November ballot; a lawsuit
against the March 5 vote has yet to work its way through the courts.
The Navy, however, could cripple those efforts by selling the first
parts of property this summer.</TE>
<TE>   The argument for an airport was always a monetary one: The added
dollars, supporters said, would enhance Orange County's position in
the global economy. The plan was to build a terminal that would serve
as many as 29 million passengers a year--later downsized to 19
million--and use El Toro's existing runways. It would be the
second-largest airport in Southern California, behind Los Angeles
International.</TE>
<TE>   A new local airport was needed, supporters argued, because John
Wayne Airport is too small and could never expand enough to
accommodate the flying public and tons of cargo now sent by freeway
to other airports.</TE>
<TE>   Most people in Orange County actually agreed with the notion that
building the new airfield would improve the economy, said Stan
Oftelie, executive director of the Orange County Business Council,
which supported an airport at the base. That didn't sway opponents,
who saw it as forever changing the character of the county.</TE>
<TE>   "From an economic development point of view, an El Toro airport
still makes good common fiscal sense," Oftelie said. "But it ignited
passions in people who didn't believe it or didn't care if it was
true. [Fighting the airport] was a way to protect their quality of
life, for those who are paying a premium for a lifestyle in Orange
County."</TE>
<TE>   Among the strongest supporters for the new airfield were the three
lawmakers who made up a slim majority on the Board of Supervisors.
They repeatedly voted to press ahead with the airport, even in the
face of weakening public support for the county's plan.</TE>
<TE>   The tide had progressively turned from the airport's approval in
1994, when the county was staggering out of the recession and voters
were more responsive to the lure of jobs and economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   As the financial picture improved, airport opponents pounded home
to voters that the county's economy was thriving just fine without an
international airport. They said the airfield would only worsen
Orange County's imbalance in its jobs-to-housing ratio because
airport workers wouldn't be able to afford to live in South County.
And the airport wasn't needed, they said, because John Wayne and
other airports throughout the region could handle Orange County
passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Issue Always Returned to Quality of Life</TE>
<TE>   At every turn, though, the debate always returned to quality of
life: "Many north Orange County residents realize that south Orange
County is a 'nicer' place and are looking to move down south and
would not want to spoil south Orange County with the airport," said
one post last week on an anti-airport Web site message board.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Eckles, executive director of a 10-city coalition of South
County cities fighting the airport, was a veteran of such wars as the
longtime city manager for Inglewood, next to LAX. Fighting El Toro
was a triumph of democracy, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that if you tried to build [an] airport in the middle of
the desert, there'd be some hermit that would say it would disturb
his tranquillity," Eckles said. "But what you had here were three
members of the board [of supervisors] who could look squarely at the
fact that it wasn't just a hermit opposing an airport but hundreds of
thousands of people who felt it was a disaster and would destroy
their quality of life."</TE>
<TE>   It was the urbanization of Orange County that led to the Marines
leaving El Toro, he said, and their retreat worked against the idea
that the former Marine base was a good place for an airport.</TE>
<TE>   According to Eckles, some people said no to the airport because
they were personally affected; some thought there were better options
for the base; and some were just anti-growth. Then there was the
school of thought, advanced by a south Orange County pastor, that
building an airport "is not a nice thing to do to your neighbors."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of weighing the preponderance of benefits," he
said. "People were firmly convinced that the airport would hurt
them."</TE>
<TE>   Others watching the El Toro debate from afar see it as a failure
of planning and an illustration of the inherent flaw in abdicating to
locals the decisions about building regionally significant
facilities. The state never intervened in the El Toro debate--on
either side--despite arguments that the placement of new airports is
a matter of statewide concern.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, a long anti-government tradition fueled the
flames. The airport was approved by voters by a narrow vote just one
month before the county's finances collapsed in a historic municipal
bankruptcy. That vote barred south Orange County's leaders from any
decision-making role about what happened at the base, sparking
simmering discontent over the region's limp political clout.</TE>
<TE>   The backlash against dictatorial government--particularly one that
had so bungled its own finances--was the same sentiment that fostered
some of the county's more notorious political associations, said
Oftelie, an armchair historian of Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The Ku Klux Klan got a foothold in Anaheim in the early 1920s, he
said, not primarily because of racial hatred but because residents
opposed the widening of Zeyn Street. The neighbors didn't want it
because they believed it would permanently change the character of
their neighborhood--and the Klan exploited that, Oftelie said.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the ultraconservative John Birch Society gained its
foothold in the county not because of its anti-globalism views, but
because members joined residents fighting to keep sex education
classes from being taught at Anaheim Union High School, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "These were issues where government was opposed because they were
trying to muck up what people had worked so hard to get," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was during the fight for El Toro that another victory over
government prevailed, this one in Los Angeles. Residents from El
Segundo and Inglewood--the closest cities to LAX--demanded that local
leaders there drop a plan advanced by former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan to expand that airport from 67 million passengers a
year to 98 million.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-expansion movement won, aided in part by powerful
sympathetic state and federal lawmakers and a competitive race to
replace Riordan as mayor.</TE>
<TE>   But to Eckles, "the whole notion being advanced that Orange County
needed to have its fair share of grief was bonkers."</TE>
<TE>   Putting any major public works project in a suburban area will
always be a touchy issue, pollster Katz said, particularly in areas
where the populace is educated and able to mobilize. In south Orange
County, affluence also came into play; cities spent more than $40
million to hire attorneys and lobbyists to work the system.</TE>
<TE>   "In a sense, the El Toro controversy and the ultimate success of
people keeping [the airport] out of their area will serve as a
guidebook for other areas facing similar battles," Katz said. "Orange
County is the vanguard."</TE>

<TE>   "My criticism for California was that they used to be on the
cutting edge of planning two decades ago, but they've gotten into
fighting over jots and tittles instead of looking at the big
picture," said Jeff Soule, policy director for the American Planning
Assn. in Washington, D.C. The fact that the two sides spent $100
million "on a family feud at the county level is just insane."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The fields that gave birth to baseball greats Darryl Strawberry and
Ozzie Smith are now home to a generation with a new love: soccer.</LD>
<LD>   More than 400 children from South-Central Los Angeles play at the
Harvard Recreation Center as part of the American Youth Soccer
Organization's Region 1031. Many do so with the help of leagues in
more affluent areas.</LD>
<LD>   The organization's philosophy is "everyone plays,"--every child
must play for at least half the game, said David Hauptman. The Culver
City resident has worked with AYSO for almost 30 years. Since most
AYSO leagues charge more than $50 per child, however, "It isn't
really 'everyone plays,'" he said. "It's 'everyone who's middle class
plays.'"</LD>
<TE>   But as South-Central's population has changed from predominantly
African American to largely Latino, demand for baseball has
decreased, making soccer the sport of choice, said Cleve
Freeman--co-founder, with Hauptman, of Region 1031. Together, they
have adapted AYSO's suburban model of coaching and organizing to fit
the needs of South-Central's emerging immigrant communities.</TE>
<TE>   Region 1031 charges youngsters $15 to join, $11 of which goes
toward insurance. The amount is low enough to allow large families to
enroll four, five, even six children. And 20% to 30% of the
players--basically anyone who asks--get scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to ask parents to pay the fees when they're struggling
to make ends meet. Once, "kids passed out on the field for lack of
food," Freeman said.</TE>
<TE>   The program survives on contributions. Wealthier leagues, which
charge $80 to $1,000 to play, collect their used uniforms for the
South-Central league. Referees donate their time. Corporate sponsors
pay tournament fees and provide equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman, a reserve officer in the Los Angeles Police Department's
77th Division, knew nothing about soccer when he started the league
seven years ago. The Hyde Park resident began recruiting players at
the request of a police captain, who saw youngsters playing the sport
in the street and wondered why no leagues existed for them.</TE>
<TE>   Freeman remembers clearly how his soccer education with Hauptman
began at team registration day. At the time Freeman had a ball under
his arm.</TE>
<TE>   "Drop the ball," Hauptman said. "And get out of the way."</TE>
<TE>   That first year, 120 children played on eight teams. The LAPD
provided some officers to coach and referee initially. The league now
averages 45 teams of girls and boys.</TE>
<TE>   At a Saturday practice, children ages 4 to 19 practiced drills on
every available inch of Harvard Recreation Center's four baseball
diamonds and mottled grass. Vendors with bicycle carts sold corn on
the cob and bags of Cheetos. Parents shouted advice. "Buscalo, hijo!"
Get it, son!</TE>
<TE>   Many of the youngsters wore black soccer socks with white
edges--the style formerly worn by referees. But when regulations
changed the referees' uniforms to a black sock with three white
stripes, Region 1031 players got the old-style socks.</TE>
<TE>   Region 1031 is not the only group offering soccer in a poor area
of the county. But through the donations that keep it going, and
games with other regions, it links South-Central's Latino community
with other parts of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously the Hispanic community is our biggest opportunity to
increase our membership," said Vince Mirabella, executive director of
California Youth Soccer Assn.-South, a major youth league.</TE>
<TE>   "They were born playing soccer," said Viviana Quinones, 17, a
player and coach.</TE>
<TE>   About 245,000 Southern California children play in AYSO, which
depends on volunteers for day-to-day operation of its leagues. In
South-Central, that's a luxury.</TE>
<TE>   "They're blue-collar workers," said Tom Rios, development manager
in AYSO's national offices of the South-Central parents. "They don't
have as much time available" to volunteer on a soccer league. But
older players pitch in when adults aren't available.</TE>
<TE>   Santo Gutierrez and his wife, Delia, are among the parents who
somehow find time to serve as coaches. Although Region 1031 is modest
compared to other AYSO regions, it's quite an improvement over what
Santo remembers growing up in El Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   "At least they can afford to buy balls," he said of Region 1031,
recalling how he and other boys in El Salvador would take a
collection to raise 25 cents to buy a plastic ball.</TE>
<TE>   The presence of Delia Gutierrez and other female coaches, as well
as girls teams, may be common elsewhere, but is a novelty for some
immigrant Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   "In the culture of that community, girls don't play soccer,"
Freeman said. "Then we had another challenge--parents didn't want men
coaching their girls."</TE>
<TE>   Some don't like women like Agripina Hernandez coaching boys,
either. "It's hard for women to coach," she said. "Men don't always
listen to women. For them it's hard to see a woman coach boys."</TE>
<TE>   The single mother sometimes crams her five children, ages four
through 17, into her tiny car to get them to practices. To earn her
coaching certificate Hernandez spent hours at workshops and
researched materials at the Amateur Athletic Assn.'s sports library
on Adams Boulevard, taking time away from her courses at East Los
Angeles College.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez didn't play sports as a child. "My parents were very
strict, since we were five girls and one boy," she said during a
recent game. For her own two daughters, however, "if they enjoy it,
I'm there to support." As she spoke, a 12-year-old goalie blocked a
shot. "All right, Simon!" she shouted. "That's my son!"</TE>
<TE>   For the future, the region will focus on grants and corporate
sponsorships to keep growing. A grant in 2000 from the Amateur
Athletic Foundation enabled it to waive the registration fees for
girls, bringing more than 200 into the league. More sponsorships will
allow the region to take a major step next season: Not only will all
youngsters in Region 1031 play, they'll play for free.</TE>

<HD>Chief Librarian Set to Start From Scratch at CSUCI</HD>
<DH>Education: While running the existing library, Paul Adalian
will draw up plans to occupy a $50-million facility opening in 2005.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Adalian may have stumbled onto a book lover's dream job.</LD>
<LD>   As the newly appointed chief librarian at Cal State Channel
Islands, he will draw up plans to occupy a $50-million library and
media center set for construction on the Camarillo campus.</LD>
<LD>   And he'll start work June 3 to a growing wave of community support
for the new facility, including a $1-million gift earlier this month
to develop and maintain the archives at the two-story,
glass-and-steel structure when it opens in 2005.</LD>
<TE>   But it's not like he'll get to put up his feet until then.</TE>
<TE>   With the university set to open this fall, Adalian will have his
hands full running an existing library at the fledgling campus. He
will have to find ways to squeeze more resources out of the cramped
facility tucked in the shadow of the historic bell tower building at
the former Camarillo State Hospital complex.</TE>
<TE>   "You can wait years to do great things, or you can start doing
great things right away," said Adalian, 57, who will leave his post
as assistant dean for information and instructional services at Cal
Poly San Luis Obispo.</TE>
<TE>   "I never aspired to be a library director; I just thought this was
a great opportunity," Adalian said. "And I think the time to do
things is now." Adalian is a long way from the Los Angeles Public
Library branch at 109th Street and Normandie Avenue, where he spent
much of his childhood satisfying a lively curiosity.</TE>
<TE>   He grew up nearby, in an area now considered Watts. He loved to
watch movies at the local theater and then run to the library to find
out how far Hollywood had stretched the facts.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Inglewood High School, Adalian earned a
bachelor's degree in history from Cal State Stanislaus and a master's
in the same subject from Loyola University in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He went on to earn a master's degree in library science from
Syracuse University in 1971 and took a job at a small college in
eastern Nebraska, where he worked with the faculty and taught classes
in library research.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to the library at San Francisco State University before
landing at the San Luis Obispo campus in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Adalian wasn't looking to leave that post. He had made a name for
himself for his knowledge of Web-enabled databases and digital
libraries. And he was skilled at drawing thousands of dollars in
grants to the campus library, including a Library of California award
to help smaller public and school libraries create internal Web
pages.</TE>
<TE>   He also was having fun at his job, known for the impromptu boccie
ball games he organized on the library carpet and his famed Library
Olympics, where library personnel raced book trucks through a slalom
course.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have to buy another boccie ball set, because he's
taking his set with him," said Hiram Davis, dean of library services
at Cal Poly.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul has been very much an integral part not only of the library
at Cal Poly but also the university as a whole," Davis said. "He has
done a tremendous job of helping us move into the 21st century."</TE>
<TE>   Channel Islands President Richard Rush said testimonials like
those convinced him that Adalian was the right person for the
Camarillo job.</TE>
<TE>   "He is excellent," Rush said. "He comes to me highly recommended,
by people whose opinions I respect, for his knowledge of libraries
and his technical expertise."</TE>
<TE>   Adalian plans to immediately put his experience to good use.</TE>
<TE>   Although the new facility will have plenty of books and reference
materials, he doesn't plan to build a traditional library. He plans
to lean heavily on electronic databases, digital library collections
and other high-tech resources.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is not only to create a library bursting with information
but also to teach students and faculty how to find, evaluate and
apply the information from the ever-growing number of sources now
available at the click of a computer mouse.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it would be kind of fun to start a brand-new library,"
said Adalian, who along with his wife, Rosemary, plans to buy one of
the condominiums the university is building behind the campus for
faculty housing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, to start
something like this from scratch."</TE>

<HD>In the Crucible, Mahony Takes Control of Message</HD>
<DH>After a defensive start, the Los Angeles diocese's
media-savvy cardinal is getting high marks for confronting abuse and

<LD>"I regret terribly what happened--but maybe without that or something
like that we wouldn't be here."</LD>
<LD>   "I wish I could undo some of the things in the past myself, [but]
now it's really a chance to look to the future--from today forward."</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal chief executive Jean-Marie Messier on the dismal
performance of the company's stock? Disney Chairman Michael Eisner on
his poor ABC television ratings?</TE>
<TE>   Neither. These are the words of Cardinal Roger M. Mahony,
archbishop of Los Angeles, head of the largest Roman Catholic diocese
in the country.</TE>
<TE>   He is church leader and CEO, pastor and politician. And just as
leaders of private corporations sometimes find themselves, he is
involved in a crisis of damage control that tests his ability to
simultaneously navigate the worlds of church doctrine and secular
society.</TE>
<TE>   The proliferating cases of sexual abuse by priests that were
ignored or covered up by bishops and cardinals in past decades have
put every American leader of the church on the defensive. Last week's
meeting of American cardinals and Vatican officials on the issue gave
Mahony, 66, his greatest media exposure and a welcome change from a
posture of defensiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks ago, about 50 of Mahony's private e-mails to his
inner circle were leaked to the media, providing fuel for stories
that questioned his sense of urgency about dealing with cases of
priestly abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The trip to Vatican City gave Mahony the opportunity to present
himself as a reformer, and even his critics were impressed, if not
convinced. Before he left for Rome, a week ago, he met with the media
to outline his agenda for the extraordinary meetings with Pope John
Paul II and other Vatican officials. He talked about the need to
discuss such controversial issues as celibacy, the ordination of
women and homosexuality in the church--carefully avoiding taking a
stand in favor of any particular policy.</TE>
<TE>   In Rome, he appeared on national news programs, morning and
evening shows, conducted interviews with the national press and held
a media briefing for the hometown press. His statements in favor of
stronger procedures to fire errant priests were made in the tone of
someone who recognized his organization had a problem and was
determined to fix it. Unspoken was the fact that some of the reforms
in Mahony's own archdiocese were the result not of his doing, but
rather of compliance with a 2001 court-approved settlement of a
molestation lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   David Clohessy, national director of the Chicago-based Survivors
Network of Those Abused by Priests, contends Mahony has "escaped the
scrutiny that many of his colleagues have been under because he is
very, very media savvy."</TE>
<TE>   A Temporary Reprieve for U.S. Cardinals</TE>
<TE>   Clohessy said the cardinals who went to Rome avoided scrutiny only
temporarily. "The sad truth is, they have to not only come back home
but come back to Earth and deal with this enormous backlog of pain
and denial and cover-up and unresolved issues around abusive
priests."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, upon his return to Los Angeles, Mahony was confronted with
the arrest of a Pomona priest. Other sex-abuse cases against his
clerics still are under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the cardinals left Rome for a Mass and dinner for
Catholic University of America in Philadelphia on Friday. But Mahony
said he needed to return swiftly to Los Angeles, where he conducted a
whirlwind series of interviews with the print and broadcast media and
sent out letters about his trip to all the parishes in his
three-county diocese--with copies of the pope's statement attached.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, the youngest American cardinal, gets high marks for his
handling of the crisis from some of his political allies in the city,
who are themselves familiar with damage control.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's an incredibly tough thing for a leader to handle,"
said former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a friend of Mahony's,
a Catholic and a veteran of managing crises. "The press is all over
you; any time you say anything, it opens the door to other stories.
You have to be very careful. I think he's been very much on top of
this."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said he breakfasted with Mahony days before his trip and
was impressed that each time he offered a strategic consideration,
Mahony said he had already thought of it.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking Advice, Consulting PR Firm</TE>
<TE>   When his e-mails were released in the press, Mahony refused to
comment. Instead, his lawyers went to court to try to prevent The
Times from publishing them. That effort failed. Friends and
associates say he then consulted them, appearing to take advice from
different sources on how to proceed. Two weeks ago he went to a major
public relations firm, Weber Shandwick, to craft the message that
would serve him in the weeks ahead.</TE>
<TE>   He began speaking publicly. He clarified the number of abuse cases
in his archdiocese--specifying, after six weeks of media inquiries,
the actual number of priests he had dismissed because of past cases
of sexual abuse. He talked about the policies he had put in place and
the need for the church to move ahead. He said that he would expand
his lay board on sexual misconduct to 15 members and that he had
asked two prominent judges to serve on it. (Mahony is expected to
announce their names this week after he meets with them.)</TE>
<TE>   And he began every interview and discussion with comments about
the victims and apologies to them. "My deepest apology to victims and
their families for any abuse that occurred," he began the Friday
morning press conference with print reporters. (He did the television
and radio broadcasts separately.)</TE>
<TE>   "Job number one," Mahony more than once told a Times reporter who
accompanied him to Rome, "is the protection of children and youth."</TE>
<TE>   He understands the news cycle so well, he even suggested that the
reporter divide the information he was providing in an interview into
two stories--one for that day, and a separate story for the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony was initially vague on the details of cases that led to
dismissal of priests. As growing awareness of abuse has led the media
to new cases in recent weeks, he still on occasion says he does not
recall the details of some cases.</TE>
<TE>   He says he does not know how much the Archdiocese of Los Angeles,
which covers Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, has
paid out in settlements with victims of abuse cases. He says he does
not have a firm grasp of how many cases there have been over the
years. He divides the cases--rather conveniently, critics
suggest--into those that occurred prior to a change in the state law
requiring clerics to report sexual abuse, and those that occurred
after that time.</TE>
<TE>   He is adamant, however, that he will not maintain abusers in his
church.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to be able to stand up in front of my people and say I can
assure you that we have not one who has violated once," Mahony said
in an interview. "There simply isn't any room for error."</TE>
<TE>   Before he left for the two days of Vatican meetings, Mahony set
fairly low expectations, saying that the trip would help educate the
officials there about the problem in the U.S. church, but that he
didn't expect to bring back new policies for his diocese.</TE>
<TE>   The American cardinals completed the talks by issuing a statement
that called for tougher policies but fell short of a "one-strike"
approach, leaving that decision for a national conference of Catholic
bishops in June.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony returned to Los Angeles boasting that his archdiocese's
policies appeared to go further than those of other dioceses in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   "It turned out to be a good teaching moment," Mahony said. "One of
the things I feel good about is I didn't come back with something
we're not doing. I feel very good about what we've been doing over
the years."</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Says Other Crises Were Worse</TE>
<TE>   He says this is not the worst chapter in his life in the church.
He points to his years in Fresno, where he served as the first
chairman of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Board,
dealing with growers and farm workers, as an even more contentious
time. He uses quotations from the Bible liberally in his
conversation. He reflects on the immediate roots of the abuse crisis:
media revelations in Boston that one priest who had allegedly
molested 130 boys was moved from parish to parish instead of being
removed from the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   That, Mahony said, "was a supreme wake-up call. 'Out of darkness
comes light.'"</TE>
<TE>   Bill Wardlaw, a lawyer and Democratic Party strategist who was
Mahony's attorney several years ago, said he believes Mahony was
helped by the trip to Rome.</TE>
<TE>   "He has shown he's a leader," Wardlaw said.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-abuse crusader Clohessy and other critics grudgingly admire
Mahony's sophistication but are frustrated by the feeling that
they're unable to hold him accountable.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no assurance whatsoever that these policies are being
followed," Clohessy said. "Where are the checks and balances? It's
just like a private corporation. Absolutely."</TE>

<BD>From Newsday</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank C. Moore II, a New York City painter who helped launch the red
ribbon as a national symbol for AIDS awareness, has died.</LD>
<LD>   Moore, 48, died April 21 of complications from AIDS at St. Luke's
Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York City.</LD>
<LD>   A popular and critical success as a painter, Moore described his
work as a journal of his long battle with HIV.</LD>
<TE>   Several of his paintings were featured in the 1995 Whitney
Biennial, a showcase of contemporary artists, and his works are part
of the collections at the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Manhattan in 1953, Moore moved with his family to Long
Island, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   He attended Yale, where he graduated summa cum laude in 1975, and
he studied at the Cite Internationale des Arts in Paris from 1977 to
1979. His art began appearing in group exhibitions in 1979, as he
worked as a set designer for modern dance choreographer Jim Self in
Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Whitney Biennial that launched him onto a national
stage, said David Leiber, director of Sperone Westwater, the gallery
that represented him.</TE>
<TE>   That exhibit showcased three of his works, including "Niagara,"
which shows a strand of DNA spiraling out of the mist of Niagara
Falls; and "Yosemite," his largest work, which depicts the national
park as an overrun, overworked theme park.</TE>
<TE>   Moore was an active board member of the Manhattan-based Visual
AIDS, a group that raises money for artists with AIDS and helps
preserve the works of artists who die of the disease.</TE>
<TE>   As one of the leaders of the group's artists caucus, he was
instrumental in conceiving of the overlapping red ribbon as a symbol
for AIDS awareness in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Moore is survived by his partner, Patrick Orton of Manhattan; his
stepmother, Katherine Moore of New York City; brothers Arthur Moore
of Pasadena and Daniel Harris of San Jose; sisters Rebecca Moore of
Los Gatos, Calif., and Elizabeth Moore of Bay Shore, N.Y.;
stepbrothers Thomas Harris of Los Gatos and Donald Harris of Dallas;
and stepsister Elizabeth Lifschultz of Chappaqua, N.Y.</TE>

<LD>A man was shot to death by Buena Park police late Friday after
leading them on a high-speed chase through two cities.</LD>
<LD>   Police did not release the name of the victim or the officer
involved.</LD>
<LD>   The officer was placed on administrative leave until the Orange
County district attorney's office investigates, said Lt. Rod Natale,
a spokesman for the Buena Park Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   Natale said the chase started about 11 p.m. Friday when officers
attempted to stop the man for driving recklessly near Beach Boulevard
and Orangethorpe Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   After leading them through Anaheim, Natale said, the man returned
to Buena Park, where he crashed into a center divider at Beach and
Manchester boulevards. Natale said the man was armed, but could not

<HD>Pagans' Presence Tests Tolerance in High Desert</HD>
<DH>Lancaster: Deputies fail to act after Christians disrupt
ritual. Some see it as a black eye for the area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the shivery evening of the spring equinox, 50 hooded pagans formed
a circle in the parking lot behind the Witches Grove gift store in
downtown Lancaster. After praying to their gods, they prepared a
ritual sacrifice: a white chocolate bunny destined for a fondue pot.</LD>
<LD>   A desert wind killed the Sterno cans, and the tongue-in-cheek
offering was spared. By then, about 20 Christians had gathered nearby
to pray for the pagans' souls, and two were walking around the circle
reading Bible verses. The tone of the evening suddenly shifted.</LD>
<LD>   Words were exchanged. A praying man, who turned out to be a
sheriff's chaplain, was blaring Christian pop tunes through his SUV
speakers. "Forgive them, Lord," he said. "They don't know what
they're doing."</LD>
<TE>   The pagans said they felt intimidated and called the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department. Although the Lancaster station is three
blocks away, it took deputies 4 1/2 hours to respond. By the time
they arrived, everyone was gone.</TE>
<TE>   The events of the evening of March 16--since dubbed "Wiccagate" by
the local media--have ignited an intense debate among local residents
over 1st Amendment rights, hate legislation and the limits of
tolerance in the high desert, a bastion of Christian conservatism
that is grappling with growing racial and religious diversity.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities Say No Crime Was Committed</TE>
<TE>   Many of the pagans call the interruption of their services a hate
crime. But Lancaster Sheriff's Capt. Tom Pigott said no one was
assaulted, no property was damaged and no laws were broken.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich has
asked the Sheriff's Department to explain why deputies took so long
to respond, and the Antelope Valley Interfaith Council has scheduled
a day of prayer May 19 in response to the events.</TE>
<TE>   "What technically happened was not a crime, but a great deal of
hatred motivated the action," said council President Bishop Bernard
Price, whose Church of St. Thomas is part of the Syrian Orthodox
Church of Antioch. "The Christians accused [the pagans] of being
Satanists, and [the pagans] don't believe in that. It's only the
religious right that believes in Satan."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Christians who were in the parking lot that night are
unrepentant and are worried that the 2-year-old shop in the heart of
downtown Lancaster is an outpost of satanic activity. Yet for many
residents, the incident is an embarrassing public relations gaffe for
the Antelope Valley.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, valley leaders have founded a number of
politically correct institutions to combat the area's reputation for
narrow-mindedness, including a hate crimes hotline, a human relations
task force and an anger management course for teens drawn to bigotry.
This year, thousands of local students created a giant human peace
symbol for the third annual "Increase the Peace" day, in which
speakers took up themes of harmony and tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   Pastor Tom Pickens, president of the Antelope Valley Christian
Ministers Assn., said events such as interfaith prayer services held
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks better reflect the valley's
religious attitudes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's somewhat unfortunate that this incident has been
blown out of proportion," Pickens said.</TE>
<TE>   Cyndia Riker--the owner of the Lancaster store catering to witches
and warlocks--disagrees. The mother of three calls her religion,
paganism, an earth-centered form of worship with a history that
predates Christianity. Paganism and a popular subset of the religion,
Wicca, have nothing to do with Satanism, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Delayed Response Called Deliberate</TE>
<TE>   Riker, who has owned the shop since September, believes the
delayed response by authorities was the result of a close
relationship between the department and some of the protesters. She
noted that Pastor Billy Pricer was among the Christians in the
parking lot that night.</TE>
<TE>   Pricer, a former sheriff's deputy, is head chaplain at the station
and works closely with local deputies through UCAN, his counseling
program for at-risk youth. The man blaring his stereo was Pricer's
son-in-law, John Canavello, then associate chaplain at the Lancaster
sheriff's station, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the pagans say Canavello flashed his sheriff's
identification card that night and told the pagans their calls to the
station would be ignored. Canavello denies the allegations, but said
his ID was on his dashboard.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Pigott denies any conspiracy. He said his deputies did not
know Pricer and Canavello were at the ceremony and they were
overburdened that night.</TE>
<TE>   Lancaster dispatchers received a call about a religious observance
being disturbed about 4 p.m., but deputies recognized the address as
a business and logged it as a loud music complaint, he said. With 76
other calls that night, deputies had to prioritize and could not get
to the shopping center until 8 p.m., well after the incident was
over.</TE>
<TE>   The incident was reviewed by hate crimes specialists from the
Sheriff's Department and the district and city attorney's offices.
They all determined that no laws were broken, said Sgt. Katherine
Voyer, who heads the sheriff's hate crimes task force.</TE>
<TE>   They also declined to categorize it as a "hate incident," because
no derogatory words were used, Voyer said.</TE>
<TE>   But Riker and other pagans said they are dismayed by what they see
as weaknesses in anti-hate laws that let the Christians off the hook.</TE>
<TE>   Riker said her group will begin lobbying officials to change the
laws.</TE>
<TE>   While Canavello has been suspended as a sheriff's chaplain for his
involvement in the incident, Riker said she also would like the
Sheriff's Department to cut its ties to Pricer.</TE>

<LD>I don't want robots for judges. Lots of judges master the lawbooks
but never slip out of their robes to see what life is like outside
the courtroom. Give me a judge, any day, who's been around the block
a few times and isn't afraid to make unpopular decisions.</LD>
<LD>   It sounds as if Judge James O. Perez is cut from that mold. But
none of those traits matter much if, when it comes to crunch time,
you make a horrendously bad call.</LD>
<LD>   And last week, Perez made one of the worst calls to come out of
Orange County Superior Court in a long, long time. You'd think the
case had been taken over by one of those "mock courtrooms" where high
school sophomores play judge--except that no 15-year-old would ever
do what Perez did.</LD>
<TE>   Perez fined a father $100 for holding his 5-year-old son's hand
over an open flame on a gas stove. The boy was never hospitalized,
but prosecutors said Wellington Soto bandaged his son's hand and that
several layers of skin were burned. The judge concluded the burns
weren't that serious.</TE>
<TE>   Perez suggested that his sentence reflected his empathy for the
"crosscurrent of customs and habits" that had brought Soto, a
Guatemalan immigrant, to court. Soto had used the flame to discipline
his son for swiping a pack of gum from an Anaheim store. Perez said
he, too, had been similarly disciplined as a child. The judge
acknowledged that the hand-burning was too severe but said it might
serve as a powerful deterrent for the young boy.</TE>
<TE>   The best we can say about Perez, a retired judge who works part
time, is that he thought too much. When he suggests that Latin
culture embraces what Soto did as parental discipline, you have to
wonder what century he's talking about. The 12th? The 13th?</TE>
<TE>   Nor is that even the point. It wouldn't matter if Guatemalan law
today required parents to hold their children's hands over open
flames. Perez is presiding in an American courtroom, and the
punishment for sticking a 5-year-old's hand over a flame is not $100.</TE>
<TE>   From newspaper accounts, Perez undercut his own argument. He said
the father might have acted differently had he thought about it. If
that's the judge's reasoning, he shouldn't say in the next breath
that cultural differences entitle the father to a break.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors filed felony charges and wanted a state prison term
for Soto. I applaud the judge for not automatically throwing the book
at Soto and agree that the case raises some provocative issues, such
as the extent of parental authority and how to deter young boys from
straying into future criminal behavior.</TE>
<TE>   I'm just dumbfounded that the judge could ask all the right
questions and come up with such an unbelievably bad answer.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the proper sentence for the elder Soto should have been 30
days in jail, a few months, or longer, the judge shouldn't have used
his courtroom to send a message that there's a "cultural" defense
when it comes to physical and mental abuse of children.</TE>
<TE>   A $100 fine is nothing more than the judge saying, "That flame
wasn't all that hot, but don't do it again."</TE>
<TE>   If the judge wanted to get philosophical before sentencing, he
should have mused about the proper parental reaction to a young boy
who swipes a pack of gum. He should have pondered whether being
burned by your father might not have a more deleterious effect on a
boy's future than stealing. Or this novel concept: whether stealing
at age 5 might not be best handled by a parental lecture instead of
physical torture.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so Perez didn't want to be a robot on the bench. He wanted to
give a first-time offender a misdemeanor conviction instead of a
felony.</TE>
<TE>   Understandable sentiment, but indefensible logic. To accept the
judge's reasoning, Soto now would have to be saying, "Oh, I didn't
realize you couldn't burn children's hands in America."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he says he knows what he did was wrong and regrets it.</TE>
<TE>   I have a hunch he knew that all along.</TE>
<TE>   And if Judge Perez is going to apply this kind of "thinking" on
his future cases, it might be a good time for him to retire
permanently.</TE>

<HD>Dioceses' Policies Reflect Settlement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cardinal Roger M. Mahony can brag that his archdiocese has
implemented the toughest rules in the nation against priests who
molest children. But that boast was made possible only because one of
the church's stubborn accusers insisted last December that the new
policy be part of his record $5.2-million settlement.</LD>
<LD>   Last week in Rome, America's cardinals and Vatican officials
grappled with exactly how unforgiving a sexual abuse policy should
be: Should they adopt a "zero-tolerance" stance for priests with a
decades-old molestation incident? They ended their two-day conference
by issuing only a generally worded statement on sexual abuse, leaving
the most difficult decisions to the nation's bishops when they meet
in June.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles archdiocese settled those matters months ago.
Mahony, along with Bishop of Orange Tod D. Brown, enacted a new set
of rules, including a "one-strike" provision that has triggered the
recent dismissal of at least a dozen priests in both dioceses. Some
of those priests had a single incident of misbehavior in their
distant past.</LD>
<TE>   The new rules also include an independent advocate who is not a
priest or diocesan employee for alleged victims, an 800 number for
anonymous complaints and a mandatory program on abuse prevention at
parochial schools.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 11 changes were made to the dioceses' policies in December
as part of a settlement with abuse victim Ryan DiMaria. The
settlement imposed a state-of-the-art sexual-abuse policy on Mahony
and Brown a full month before the church's sex scandal broke in
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   The beefed-up rules, whose implementation was overseen by Orange
County Superior Court Judge James P. Gray, gave the prelates the look
of prophets.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony and Brown rarely refer to the legal settlement that brought
about the new rules, though they frequently have highlighted the
policy with pride in media reports, letters to parishioners and on
Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, in March, the Los Angeles archdiocese distributed to
parishioners a brochure called "Respecting the Boundaries: Keeping
Ministerial Relationships Healthy and Holy." Archdiocese spokesman
Tod Tamberg said at the time that the cardinal decided to hand out
the information because of the surge of attention to priest sex
scandals that erupted in January with the criminal trial of a Boston
cleric accused of molesting 130 children.</TE>
<TE>   "Cardinal Mahony thought ... it was important for him to reiterate
to the Catholic faithful that we have comprehensive policies on sex
abuse, that we follow them carefully and review them regularly,"
Tamberg said.</TE>
<TE>   The informational campaign was one of the measures imposed by the
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "Cardinal Mahony is giving this perception that he did this on his
own," said Katherine K. Freberg, one of DiMaria's attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony flatly denied Friday that he may have been forced into the
new policies by lawsuits, saying that he had been developing and
implementing the procedures well before the Dec. 4 settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Some Measures Already in Place</TE>
<TE>   Maria Schinderle, director of human resources for the Orange
diocese, said the settlement prompted some changes, but said it was
unfair to say that the settlement was responsible for 11 innovations
in the way the church handled molestation allegations. She said some
of the measures already were in place and others were on the drawing
board.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why it didn't take long to implement it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   DiMaria's attorneys cite the timing: After a four-year legal
battle, the dioceses agreed to the changes only weeks before a
potentially costly and embarrassing jury trial.</TE>
<TE>   DiMaria, a recent law school graduate, claimed that he had been
abused as a teenager by the principal at his Catholic high school.
Msgr. Michael Harris, a popular Orange County clergyman who was
nicknamed "Father Hollywood," has denied the charges.</TE>
<TE>   Four other alleged victims, not parties to DiMaria's lawsuit, also
accused Harris of similar misconduct. The Los Angeles archdiocese was
named in the suit because DiMaria contended that the archdiocese knew
of another victim's allegations against Harris, dating back to the
1970s, but did nothing about them. The archdiocese has denied prior
knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   DiMaria, now in his late 20s, has declined to give media
interviews since the settlement, but his attorneys said his primary
goal in suing the dioceses was to fix a broken system that protected
priests and scorned victims like himself.</TE>
<TE>   Though DiMaria received the highest known settlement for a single
U.S. victim of priest abuse, "the truth is, our client took less
money to get this done" by electing not to go to trial, where changes
in church policy would not have been at issue, said John Manly,
DiMaria's other attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Last August, Judge Gray called a settlement conference where he
told both parties that the revelations that had surfaced during the
lawsuit had sickened him. He said they "made my skin crawl" and left
him "crying inside."</TE>
<TE>   "This case will live with me as long as I'm thinking and
breathing," he said later in court.</TE>
<TE>   Gray told the parties that he wanted, as DiMaria had requested,
new guidelines added to the church's sexual abuse policy--and he
wanted them "in concrete" before any discussion of financial
compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Gray, who declined to be interviewed for this story, asked
DiMaria, his parents and his attorneys to come up with some initial
suggestions.</TE>
<TE>   Manly, a Navy reservist, lifted many of the ideas, including the
anonymous 800 number and zero-tolerance concept, from the Navy's
sexual harassment policy developed after the Tailhook scandal.</TE>
<TE>   The experiences of other victims generated other provisions, such
as independent exit interviews of students quitting St. John's
Seminary in Camarillo, where most Southern California priests are
trained.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Freberg even searched Scripture to back the argument for
a "zero tolerance" policy for priests who molest minors. She found it
in Luke's Gospel: "It would be better for him to be thrown into the
sea with a millstone tied around his neck than for him to cause one
of these little ones to sin."</TE>
<TE>   "The operative word is one," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The two dioceses agreed to the provisions, though there was some
haggling over the specifics.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials said they gladly instituted the changes since
they only enhanced existing policies or jump-started additions
already under discussion.</TE>
<TE>   The hotline, for example, "was part of our plan already," Mahony
said. "We had already proposed the hotline before that settlement
agreement came out."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said his zero-tolerance policy toward clerics who abuse
children was started in 1990. However, it was not until last
December--shortly after the Dec. 4 settlement--that the archdiocese
did a thorough review of all past allegations.</TE>
<TE>   That turned up seven cases that occurred before 1997. As a result,
in January several priests in the Los Angeles Archdiocese were told
to leave--if they hadn't already retired.</TE>
<TE>   Freberg and other critics noted that by signing the settlement,
the dioceses faced financial responsibility if a priest with a known
background of molestation remained in the diocese and went on to
abuse a minor.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't imagine the civil liability that would come down on
them," Freberg said. "The sky's the limit."</TE>

<HD>Freight Security Stressed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>National transportation leaders Saturday urged government and
industry to set aside their competitive and political disputes in
order to craft advanced technologies to protect freight supply chains
from terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got to keep competition out of security," said Gene
Pentimonti, a consultant to the U.S. Department of Transportation,
"and we've got to make real progress."</LD>
<LD>   His comments came during a gathering of about 200 transportation
technology and security experts at the start of a three-day national
conference at the Long Beach Convention Center.</LD>
<TE>   "We've seen a significant lack of government leadership on this
issue, while industry has launched a lot of small group
problem-solving sessions," said Pentimonti, an expert in the movement
of freight. "God bless them. But what we really need are huge
solutions involving international networks."</TE>
<TE>   The stakes could not be higher. Federal authorities and industry
leaders fear that another attack could prompt self-imposed blockades
of ports, choking supply chain flows and sapping the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The 10,000-member U.S. Customs Service is able to screen only a
fraction of the 20- to 40-foot-long containers that arrive each year
loaded with goods ranging from car parts and frozen chicken feet to
toys and athletic shoes.</TE>
<TE>   But forging new procedures for ensuring that all those nondescript
metal boxes--and their modes of delivery--are tamper-proof will not
be easy, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's marine transportation system handles more than 2
billion tons of freight, 3 billion tons of oil and 7 million
containers annually. It is linked to a logistics chain of shipping
agents, carriers, tugboats, terminals, dockworkers, regulatory
agencies, railroads, truckers, brokers, customs agencies and
warehouse operations.</TE>
<TE>   Given the complexity of the challenge, transportation leaders have
set a handful of critical objectives. They include the development of
globally uniform technical standards, databases and high-tech
security devices.</TE>

<HD>Residents Fight a Flood of Commuters</HD>
<DH>Encino: Homeowners are at wits' end, but drivers accuse
them of elitism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The narrow roads winding past the hedge-lined estates of the Encino
hills seem an unlikely setting for an urban traffic hell.</LD>
<LD>   But just wait until rush hour.</LD>
<LD>   That's when commuters from the San Fernando Valley's flatlands
flood into the hills, anxious for a faster way across the Santa
Monica Mountains.</LD>
<TE>   They come with engines roaring, brakes screeching and horns
blaring. Some gesture rudely at residents struggling to get out of
their own driveways. And on occasion, a four-wheeled invader will
vault a curb.</TE>
<TE>   "They're nasty, nasty people," said Margery Grossman, pointing to
where out-of-control cars had plowed into her daughter's Saab and two
brick walls in front of her home on Ballina Canyon Road. "They don't
think of the fact that people live here."</TE>
<TE>   With average commute times getting longer, many Southland
neighborhoods have seen their peace and quiet shattered by
shortcut-seeking motorists.</TE>
<TE>   Each weekday, more than 120,000 commuters use residential streets
to traverse the Santa Monica Mountains between the Valley and the
rest of Los Angeles. In the last 25 years, such traffic has grown
about 40%, said Yadi Hashemi, transportation engineer for the Los
Angeles Department of Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   One area suffering the brunt of this is this 4.5-square-mile swath
of the Encino hills. The problem is so bad that the city is holding a
vote-by-mail referendum on possible solutions. But the referendum is
also fueling an uproar among the many drivers and nearby residents
who don't live in the hills. They call attempts to restrict traffic
elitist.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it because some of these homes are more valuable than others
that they can prevent people from using public streets?" asked Carol
Glushon, who lives in a more modest Encino neighborhood north of
Ventura Boulevard. "The residents there don't own the streets."</TE>
<TE>   The Transportation Department has mailed ballots to 4,800
households in the Encino hills. Residents have until May 3 to cast
their votes.</TE>
<TE>   The changes would attempt to restrict the number of cars heading
south into the hills along three miles of Ventura Boulevard.
Residents will be asked whether the city should make traffic lights
stay red longer, install no-turn signs and add a left-turn light at a
San Diego Freeway onramp.</TE>
<TE>   The department requires two-thirds approval by at least 40% of the
surrounding households. The balloting is somewhat informal; it is not
regulated by city election laws.</TE>
<TE>   It is the city's third and by far largest traffic referendum, also
believed to be the biggest in the country. From Portland, Ore., to
Dayton, Ohio, such neighborhood polls are becoming a popular means of
gauging support for "traffic calming" measures such as speed bumps,
roundabouts and street closures.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to make sure [residents] are happy with the change,"
said Reid Ewing, author of the 1999 Federal Highway Administration
book "Traffic Calming: State of the Practice."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s, transit planners saw the need for more freeways
through the Santa Monicas, including a Reseda Freeway just west of
the Encino hills. It was among the many that were envisioned for the
Los Angeles region but later abandoned because of neighborhood
opposition, among other reasons.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, traffic continued to pour into the residential
streets of the hills. Now, an estimated 70% of the cars on Encino
hills roads are cut-through traffic, according to the Transportation
Department.</TE>
<TE>   "This neighborhood has become a freeway alternative," said Pauline
Chan, a senior transportation engineer for the city.</TE>
<TE>   Artie Harris, a scout for the Los Angeles Dodgers, pointed to his
flower bed, which has twice been smashed by cars that skidded over
the sidewalk. Up and down Calneva Drive, trees have been toppled and
utility poles rammed.</TE>
<TE>   "Motorcycle guy couldn't negotiate curve and ended up in the
bushes, right there," said Harris, motioning across the street from
his home of 31 years. "A car rolled a few times over there," he
continued, directing a finger farther downthe street.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the Corvette that plowed into his brother's parked
sedan. The driver came "this close" to getting decapitated, said
Harris, holding his hands inches apart.</TE>
<TE>   As he spoke, a neighbor's electric gate slid open and a black
Lexus nosed out, causing a sport utility vehicle speeding up the hill
to screech to a halt.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you see that?" Harris shouted. "She just missed getting hit!
There are near misses constantly."</TE>
<TE>   Some mountain-crossing primary roads, such as Sepulveda, Laurel
Canyon and Beverly Glen boulevards, are expected to shoulder heavy
traffic. These so-called secondary highways are relatively straight
and wide. Many of their homes sit far apart, behind dense foliage,
and have driveways that feed onto side roads.</TE>
<TE>   Most roads in the Encino hills are more like capillaries. They
were never intended to carry big traffic loads. The streets swoop
this way and that, with blind curves and steep climbs.</TE>
<TE>   A few months ago, a car speeding down Calneva careered onto
Shahriar Rad's estate. It crunched the base of a Greek statue,
demolished some brickwork and knocked over a pair of mature palm
trees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a madhouse," said Rad, a chiropractor, as he gazed ruefully
at two replacement saplings he planted in front of his home.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife, Atoosa, want to move. Their 1 1/2-year-old
daughter, Shilyn, is having trouble sleeping because of honking horns
and gunning motors, said Atoosa Rad, cradling the saucer-eyed
toddler.</TE>
<TE>   As traffic-calming measures go, the city's proposals for the hills
are moderate, with a goal of reducing traffic by 15%, said Chan, of
the Transportation Department.</TE>
<TE>   In the early '90s, the city considered more radical solutions for
the hills--such as barricading streets. But those ideas were nixed
when residents realized how inconvenient they could be.</TE>
<TE>   Other fixes the city tried had unintended effects.</TE>
<TE>   At a T-intersection across from Rad's house, the city installed
stop signs about a year ago to slow the traffic on Calneva. But the
signs caused mile-long backups, fueled minor incidents of road rage
and did nothing to stop some cars. The signs were eventually removed.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the Transportation Department is pursuing changes one small
step at a time. It plans to start by tweaking four traffic signals so
there is less green time for cars trying to cross Ventura Boulevard
to enter the hills.</TE>
<TE>   If that fails to divert enough traffic, the city will adjust more
lights. A last resort would be signs prohibiting rush-hour turns into
the hills.</TE>
<TE>   The proposals make drivers shudder.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I would tear my hair out," said Debbie Plotkin, a
Woodland Hills mother.</TE>
<TE>   Plotkin motors through the hills to take her son, Adam, to his
private school on Mulholland Drive. If she was forced to take the
Ventura and San Diego freeways, two of California's most congested,
her half-hour drive could stretch to an hour, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before 8 a.m. on a recent school day, she was driving her
son through streets thick with cars. Many were lumbering uphill
toward Mulholland and its mountaintop cluster of private schools.</TE>
<TE>   "To make it more difficult for parents is outrageous," Plotkin
said.</TE>
<TE>   Even some who live in the hills fear that the proposed
restrictions could keep them out of their own neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "If I want to go work out or go grocery shopping, I can't get back
to my house," said Jami Abell-Venit, a stay-at-home mother of three
who lives on Cananea Drive. "It limits gardeners, delivery people,
household help and school buses ... not to mention those you might
want to carpool with."</TE>
<TE>   Encino residents who live north of Ventura Boulevard are seething
because they have been excluded from the voting. They say the traffic
restrictions might shove the congestion across the boulevard and into
their front yards.</TE>
<TE>   The boulevard serves as a social railroad track of sorts, drawing
a line between the northern, mostly middle-class flatlands and the
wealthier enclaves in the hills to the south.</TE>
<TE>   That divide is behind the sentiment that the traffic proposals are
designed to pamper the well-to-do.</TE>
<TE>   "They're getting rid of the problem 'south of' and dumping it on
the folks 'north of,'" said Gerald A. Silver, president of Homeowners
of Encino. Silver has been lobbying the city, so far unsuccessfully,
to allow everyone in the community of 42,500 to vote on the proposed
restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Residents in the hills say there is nothing elitist about wanting
to back out of their driveways without risking a high-speed
collision.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't know it until you live it, and we've lived it with
agony all these years," said Grossman, whose daughter's car and
fences have been among the casualties of cut-through drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Guillermo Young, a pediatric cardiologist who lives a few
streets away, enthusiastically agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "If you try to make a left turn out of our house, they go crazy.
They give you the ... finger," Young said, raising his voice to be
heard as car after car whooshed past his spacious hacienda.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you imagine? We are imprisoned in our own house!"</TE>

<HD>Whitney Smith, 91; Pioneer in Modernist Architecture</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whitney R. Smith, an award-winning Pasadena architect who contributed
considerably to the emergence of post-World War II modernist
architecture, has died. He was 91.</LD>
<LD>   Smith died March 13 of natural causes at his home in Bend, Ore.,
where he had lived briefly after retiring to Sonoma, Calif., in 1987.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, who went into private practice in the early 1940s, was
joined by architect Wayne R. Williams in 1946. Williams became a
partner in 1949 and during the next 24 years the firm of Smith and
Williams produced numerous national and Southern California
award-winning architectural projects, including private residences,
schools, community buildings and recreational facilities.</LD>
<TE>   Smith was among a group of Los Angeles architects and designers
who participated in the "Case Study Houses" program of experimental
modern houses designed and built primarily in Los Angeles from 1945
to 1966.</TE>
<TE>   Initiated by John Entenza, editor of the Los Angeles-based Arts &amp;
Architecture magazine, the program was designed to influence public
opinion and the construction industry in accepting modern
architecture during the postwar building boom.</TE>
<TE>   The Case Study Houses, which were meant to be affordable homes for
the typical middle-class family, showcased several major innovations
that became standard in popular house design.</TE>
<TE>   They include open floor plans with minimal internal walls to allow
the interior to be flexible and appear spacious, the integration of
indoor and outdoor living through the use of sliding glass doors, and
the reversal of the traditional home plan by relocating the living
rooms at the rear of the house.</TE>
<TE>   Arts &amp; Architecture published all 36 Case Study Houses designs,
and 24 were built for clients.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's two 1946 designs, which were not built, were among the
most experimental and innovative in the program, said Elizabeth A.T.
Smith, author of the recently published "Case Study Houses: The
Complete Program."</TE>
<TE>   "Basically the fundamental innovations of those designs had to do
with a radical integration of indoors and outdoors within the houses'
plans," said Smith, chief curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art
in Chicago. "They were very much opened up to nature and were
oriented around gardens and natural plantings.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that one of the primary characteristics of Smith's
designs not only in these but throughout his career was his synthesis
of experimental materials and structures with a real sense of
appreciation for nature, the climate in Southern California and the
landscape. And he was able to fuse these concerns to create very
sensitively designed works of architecture."</TE>
<TE>   From 1946 to 1950, Smith and Williams joined architect A. Quincy
Jones and engineer Edgardo Contini in designing and building the
acclaimed Mutual Housing Assn. development, a large tract of houses
in the Crestwood Hills area of Brentwood.</TE>
<TE>   The designs, which incorporated postwar techniques and building
materials such as butterfly roofs, steel doors and innovative
seamless plate-glass windows to take full advantage of the views, are
considered key examples of the Southern California style of
architecture that has since spread throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   Architectural photographer Julius Shulman, who photographed much
of Smith and Williams' work, said they represented the transition
from the modern architecture of Richard Neutra and R.M. Schindler,
who arrived in California in the 1920s and followed the precepts of
modernism as practiced in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called International Style of architecture was known for
flat roofs, low ceilings and considerable use of glass walls.</TE>
<TE>   "People jokingly called them the glass box because they had so
much glass," Shulman said. "When Smith and Williams began to practice
their architecture, they rebelled against the idea of having all that
glass with a minimum of privacy ... and not having enough flexibility
to the floor plan.</TE>
<TE>   "They broke away from the flat roofs, the box-like design and they
instead opened up the interiors with higher ceilings, sloping roofs
and many features which made the modern houses more livable."</TE>
<TE>   Among the firm's various projects: the Unitarian Church in
Pasadena, the UCLA north campus student union and the UCLA Canyon
Recreation Center, the central power building at Caltech, the dining
facility and ancillary facilities at Camp Curry in Yosemite, the
Griffith Park Girls Camp, the Santa Ana government center, the Buena
Park Civic Center and the Japanese teahouse at Descanso Gardens in La
Canada Flintridge.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Pasadena in 1911, Smith received a bachelor's degree in
architecture from USC in 1934.</TE>
<TE>   With architectural work at a premium during the Depression, Smith
was employed for a time as a movie set designer. He then worked for
various architects, including the renowned Harwell Hamilton Harris, a
modernist whom Smith cited as having a strong influence on his work.</TE>
<TE>   After starting his own private practice in 1941, Smith designed
the Linda Vista Shopping Center in San Diego, one of the first
shopping centers to be built around a central green, with parking on
the perimeter behind the buildings.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the firm of Smith and Williams in 1973, Smith
operated his own private practice in South Pasadena until the
mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   His projects included designing the entrance complex and
auditorium for the Huntington Library in San Marino, the Pasadena
Neighborhood Church and the science building, art studio and
gymnasium at Westridge School for Girls in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Smith taught architecture and planning at USC in the early '40s
and at Scripps College in Claremont from 1945 to 1952.</TE>
<TE>   He also served on the Planning Commission and the Community
Redevelopment Agency of South Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by a son, Gregory of Petaluma, Calif.; a daughter,
Annabel Ziegler of Bend, Ore.; and a grandson.</TE>

<HD>School Bus Drivers Could End Strike With Contract Vote</HD>
<DH>Labor: Workers for an L.A. district contractor will cast
ballots today in the 26-day-old walkout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bus drivers who went on strike for better pay and medical benefits
will vote today on a contract that increases their salary, but does
not resolve their health-care issues.</LD>
<LD>   If the 842 drivers, who have been on strike for 26 days, approve
the contract with Laidlaw Educational Services, about 20,000 Los
Angeles Unified School District children could be back in their
yellow buses Monday morning.</LD>
<LD>   Union officials will announce the vote results sometime today.</LD>
<TE>   The contract calls for major health benefit issues to be settled
later by an arbitrator.</TE>
<TE>   Basically, the union wants a new insurance carrier that it
believes will better serve its members and provide lower-cost
premiums. Laidlaw does not want to change carriers.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the contract, the union will take 25 different
insurance claims filed by bus drivers and evaluate whether the
carrier used by the Teamsters Union would be cheaper. The bus drivers
union wants to use any savings to improve benefits. Laidlaw wants to
control how the money is spent.</TE>
<TE>   Laidlaw and the union also have not decided who will pay for
dependent health-care benefits and whether the company will continue
to pay a stipend for senior drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials would not disclose publicly the amount of the
salary increase. Drivers will be allowed to retain a pension plan
that Laidlaw had sought to eliminate and will still receive overtime
pay.</TE>
<TE>   Teamsters spokesman Don Owens said health-care benefits were so
weak that as many as half of the drivers who work full time qualify
for Medi-Cal benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "Laidlaw has been de facto dependent on welfare for these folks'
health care for years," Owens said.</TE>
<TE>   A Laidlaw official said the strike could have ended weeks ago when
the current terms were proposed.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had the same package on the table for weeks," said Jim
Ferraro, Laidlaw area vice president. "Aside from the arbitration,
everything else is status quo."</TE>

<HD>First Lady Eager to Escape 1780s 'Paradise'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CECILIA RASMUSSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She was California's first First Lady, the "Queen of California." But
she hated it here so much that she schemed to divorce her
governor-husband in what has been recorded as California's first
grand public marital scandal.</LD>
<LD>   Dona Eulalia Callis de Fages, the wife of early Spanish Gov. Pedro
Fages, was the first resident First Lady of the state. A pampered
spitfire of rank and social standing, she was uprooted from family
and friends in Spain to live in Monterey.</LD>
<LD>   The future home of golf courses and good living was a desolate,
primitive outpost in the 1780s. Reeling from culture shock,
loneliness, boredom and 20 months of pregnancy (two full-term babies
and a miscarriage), she nagged her husband to quit his job and return
to Spain or Mexico City. When he refused, she hatched a plan that
would erupt into a scandal and provincial cause celebre.</LD>
<TE>   Pedro Fages first came to colonial California years before he was
appointed governor. He was one of 62 Spanish soldiers who accompanied
Gaspar de Portola northward through California in search of Monterey
Bay in 1769. With the founding of the Monterey Presidio and Mission
San Carlos Borromeo in Carmel, Fages and his soldiers were left
behind to protect the outpost.</TE>
<TE>   When supplies from Mexico failed to arrive, he hunted wild grizzly
bears in San Luis Obispo and saved the Presidio residents from
starvation. He planted 600 trees at his own expense and kept his
pockets full of coins to hand out to the children.</TE>
<TE>   Although a hero to some, he was a thorn in the side of Father
Junipero Serra, the founder of the missions, whose headquarters was
in Carmel. Control over the Indian population was a constant power
struggle between the two men. They quarreled often. In 1772, the
struggle over control of the natives came to a head. While Fages was
on horseback in hot pursuit of six Army deserters who ran away with
Indian women, Serra was on his way to Mexico to wrest control of the
Indians from the military.</TE>
<TE>   Fages returned without the deserters, but Serra had obtained a
Bill of Rights for the Indians from the regional Spanish authorities.
It stated that "the management, control, and education of the
baptized Indians pertains exclusively to the mission fathers ... just
as the father of a family has charge of his house and the ...
correction of his children."</TE>
<TE>   The relationship between the soldier and the padre would wax and
wane over the years that they helped build colonial California.</TE>
<TE>   Fages, 50, a tough military leader, more than met his match in
22-year-old Eulalia. They married in Spain in 1780. Two years later,
he had returned to the New World to continue his soldiering.</TE>
<TE>   Soon he was appointed governor of California and returned to
Monterey, where he began making the first grants of ranchos.</TE>
<TE>   When he joined his wife and baby son in Baja California for their
reluctant journey northward, he gave her a string of pearls. During
their trip, Eulalia suffered a miscarriage, but would be pregnant
again before arriving in Monterey.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, mission bells, cannon fire and fiestas greeted the
woman dubbed "Queen of California." Awed to see a woman of such
aristocratic bearing, soldiers' wives kissed her hand and Native
Americans lavished her with gifts, including a long mantle of sea
gull feathers.</TE>
<TE>   Drenched with rain upon her arrival in Monterey in 1784, Eulalia
archly commented to her husband, "Paradise!" Horrified at seeing
naked Indian women, she began handing out some of her own garments to
cover them. Other natives helped themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Serra walked from the mission to Monterey to welcome her. The next
day, arriving for Mass, she at first was appalled, then amused, at
the sight of one Indian woman clad in her missing red velvet ball
gown, and another perfectly comfortable in a purple brocade mantle,
but no skirt.</TE>
<TE>   In August 1784, the pain of losing her newborn baby was too much
to bear, coupled with the death of her friend, Father Serra, two
weeks later. Eulalia became depressed and begged her husband to
resign and return to Spain with her. He refused. She became
hysterical. After calming down, she decided to torment Fages with the
silent treatment. She also locked him out of the bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 3, 1785, was Eulalia's "Day of Infamy." She found her husband
and a beautiful Indian servant, Dolores, together in Dolores' room.
At last, Eulalia believed she had the proof she needed for a divorce
and a return trip to Spain.</TE>
<TE>   But the governor defended himself, explaining that he had merely
gone to awaken Dolores when his wife burst in, accusing him of
planning a sinful act.</TE>
<TE>   Fages rode to Carmel to bear his soul to Father Matias Noriega. He
returned home with the padre in tow, hoping his wife would listen to
some priestly advice. But when Noriega told her she had no grounds
for divorce, she replied: "I would rather live with the devil in hell
than with Don Pedro."</TE>
<TE>   Noriega confined her to her room with a military guard posted
outside. Thus began the divorce proceedings of Fages vs. Fages.</TE>
<TE>   Noriega acted as judge. He interviewed witnesses, mostly military
personnel, who sided with the governor. Dolores, the star witness,
also took the side of the governor, fearing his wrath and even
imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   Dolores allegedly told two matrons the real story, but Noriega
failed to call them. The case was pretty much decided, written up and
sent to the bishop in Sonora, Mexico, who would officially decide
Eulalia's fate.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting for the decision, Noriega said Mass for the residents at
the Presidio chapel, making a few remarks from the pulpit about the
scrapping couple. Angry and unwilling to sit still and listen to the
priest's purported insults, Eulalia got up to leave the chapel,
muttering under her breath.</TE>
<TE>   But Noriega ordered troops "to detain that woman, for I shall
muzzle her." He also threatened to excommunicate anyone who as much
as talked to her.</TE>
<TE>   Unwilling to leave his wife while he sailed south on business,
Fages asked Noriega to keep his wife locked up at the mission until
he returned. Eulalia refused to go and locked herself and their
4-year-old son in her room.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife is a lunatic," the governor said. Forcing the door open,
he threatened to send her shackled, until she finally agreed to go
peacefully.</TE>
<TE>   While imprisoned, she tormented the priest with regular outbursts
of her temper until Noriega threatened to have her flogged and put in
chains.</TE>
<TE>   She wrote to the commandant general in Mexico, seeking legal
advice and asking for his protection and some financial support until
her plight was resolved. Fages also wrote the general, hoping he
could arrange a reconciliation.</TE>
<TE>   The general advised the governor that his wife should not be
treated so indignantly, that she was a woman of social status who
deserved respect. The general wrote Eulalia that she must restrain
her temper and behave like a lady.</TE>
<TE>   Fages worried that Noriega was becoming too rough with his wife
and allowed her to return to Mexico City. But she had a change of
heart, and two months after it all began, she made peace with her
husband and returned to Monterey. She continued to henpeck her
husband, but he reportedly silenced her with his kisses.</TE>
<TE>   Fages resigned in 1791, citing old age, and later joined his wife
and children in Mexico City. He died in 1794 at 64 or 65, leaving
behind his 36-year-old widow, a diary, and journals of his research
and explorations.</TE>
<TE>   Eulalia's perseverance in the face of difficult and primitive
conditions encouraged more Spanish women to venture into the wild
frontier of California. She left a reputation for her kindness and
charities to the poor and sick.</TE>
<TE>   But Dona Eulalia is better remembered for the fury she unleased on
her husband and the scandal it caused in the Presidio of Monterey.</TE>

The 10th annual event is the largest single-day food drive in the
country.</LD>
<LD>   Because food banks report dwindling supplies as summer approaches,
the National Assn. of Letter Carriers and the U.S. Postal Service
sponsors the drive on the weekend before Mother's Day.</LD>
<LD>   Nonperishable, unopened foods may be left next to mailboxes for
carriers to pick up while on their delivery routes.</LD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Ventura County Christian School was offered the opportunity to
lease the former Washington Elementary School, a venerable campus in
midtown Ventura, administrators thought their prayers had been
answered.</LD>
<LD>   They agreed to refurbish the dilapidated campus for reduced rent.
But when the repair tab turned out to be a daunting figure, the
school erected portable classrooms at the Macmillan Street site for
temporary use, planning to chip away at a list of repairs as they
raised funds.</LD>
<LD>   Now, angered by the gray portables looming over their property, a
few neighbors have complained to the city. And the city and the
Ventura Unified School District agree that the school failed to
obtain necessary permits for the portables and other renovations, a
position that Ventura County Christian disputes.</LD>
<TE>   For the foreseeable future, the school remains in its cramped
quarters across the street at Grace Church, and renovations have
stopped at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura Christian has had three homes in its nine-year existence,
and throughout that time, Lisa Darby, a founding member of the
school, prayed that the Washington site would become available.</TE>
<TE>   Washington, built in 1925 and vacant for about 15 years, had
become a magnet for the homeless, drug users and vandals.</TE>
<TE>   In late 1999, Ventura Christian signed a 20-year lease with
Ventura Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, school workers and volunteers have repainted
Washington's exterior, erected a fence around the property, replaced
the windows, leveled the sports field and re-roofed and renovated the
auditorium, a free-standing building that includes space for the
cafeteria.</TE>
<TE>   But then came the setbacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Repair Bills Begin Mounting</TE>
<TE>   The school discovered it would cost an estimated $7 million to
make the main building structurally sound--a daunting sum to an
institution with only 70 students.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Ventura County Christian decided it could open at the new
site by using portables.</TE>
<TE>   "Even the trailers are a big step up for us," said Keith Letus, a
2001 graduate of the private school. "The classrooms are twice as big
and have windows and air-conditioning."</TE>
<TE>   But neighbors say they weren't properly informed about the
portable classrooms because the permit process wasn't followed.</TE>
<TE>   "We were on vacation in September and we came back and they were
there," said Robert Sales, who lives on San Nicholas Street, next to
Washington. The raised land under the portables now towers over his
retaining wall, sparking concerns about how runoff might affect his
yard.</TE>
<TE>   "At first we thought they had just put the portables there
haphazardly" and were going to move them, said neighbor Paul
Kermoyan, who works as a community developer with the city of
Carpinteria. But when he realized that the school planned to place
the buildings just 13 feet from his property for a number of years,
he alerted Ventura officials.</TE>
<TE>   Darby maintains that the neighbors were invited to meetings to
discuss the placement of the portables, but that they chose not to
attend.</TE>
<TE>   But Kermoyan said that the school's failure to apply for a permit
effectively removed him from the process.</TE>
<TE>   The city cited the school for the grading and placement of the
portables and issued a stop-work order.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wants to operate a private school, it needs a use permit
from the city," City Atty. Robert Boehm said. "We're encouraging them
to do what the law requires."</TE>
<TE>   The process, he said, would involve the school applying for a
conditional use permit, followed by an open hearing, before a
decision could be handed down by the city's planning director.</TE>
<TE>   But the school's lawyer, Dan Carobini, thinks the process would be
more involved than that. "The process is very burdensome," he said.
"There are high fees that have to be paid and conditions the city
could impose," such as traffic and parking mitigation plans.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know how many hoops we're going to have to jump
through," Darby said, arguing that other private entities on public
property have not been forced to get permits. "We're getting
discriminated against and we're being harassed."</TE>
<TE>   City officials denied her allegations.</TE>
<TE>   While school districts typically are exempt from municipal rules
regarding land use and only have to abide by state standards, private
schools--even those on public school property--are not, Boehm said.</TE>
<TE>   Carobini says the school still is examining the law, including the
federal Religious Land Use Act, to determine whose rules they have to
follow.</TE>
<TE>   Other neighbors are happy to see the scarred building being
restored and the vandalism abated.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lived here two years and all I've seen are vandals and
hoodlums," said Jim MacDonald, who lives on Santa Barbara Street.
"What we've seen so far, the cleanup, has been great. It's really
exciting to see it renovated."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors Willing to Compromise</TE>
<TE>   At Kermoyan's home, bougainvilleas proliferate atop the fence
separating his property from the school but doesn't block views of
the structures next door.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he is not against Ventura County Christian moving in. He
and his neighbor, Sales, said they would be happy if the school
simply moved the portables away from their property, something that
Darby says the school will not do for a number of reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "We're willing to compromise," said Sales, who was recently told
that the proximity of the portables would subtract $10,000 from his
home's value. "They have no consideration. They feel as if they're
the priority in the neighborhood."</TE>

<HD>Yoga at School Poses a Learning Opportunity</HD>
<DH>Classroom: Teachers note calming effect, better
concentration among their students.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>It is getting close to lunchtime, and Cathy Klein's second-grade
class at Daniel Webster Elementary School is feeling a little wiggly.</LD>
<LD>   When Klein asks them to put down their pencils and find some
personal space around the classroom for yoga, they jump to it. Soon
they are breathing deeply, in through their noses and out through
their mouths. With determined looks, they are earnestly stretching
and balancing their little bodies into poses named for animals and
shapes: new moon, kangaroo, seahorse and ostrich.</LD>
<LD>   When they stretch out on the floor 20 minutes later for the final
cocoon pose, a resting position, their wiggles are gone. They are
calm and focused, and they sit cross-legged and smiling to answer
questions about the yoga exercises that have become commonplace in
their classroom--and at several other schools across San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   "It makes me feel great, because we're doing like the
animal does," said 7-year-old Willy Rosales. "The anteater is my
favorite. You get to stretch your legs, and you can stretch your arms
all the way around."</TE>
<TE>   ABC Yoga Teaches Students 12 Poses</TE>
<TE>   While adults are flocking to yoga classes in record numbers, these
students are benefiting from a 5-year-old program in San Francisco
that aims to teach schoolteachers yoga proficiency so they can take
its benefits into the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   The brainchild of U.S. Yoga Assn. founder and San Francisco Yoga
Studio executive director Tony Sanchez, the program has trained
dozens of teachers so far.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez and his wife, Sandy Wong, started the program pro bono,
and it has expanded with grants from the San Francisco Education Fund
and other foundations. Teachers from two additional schools will be
trained starting in September, and the couple are applying for a
federal grant that would enable them to reach every district school.</TE>
<TE>   "School itself can be stressful, and a lot of these children come
from dysfunctional families or one-parent families. The stress their
parents experience transfers to them," said Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the basics of yoga is to be giving, and we decided that it
was something we should do instead of just using yoga to make money.
We felt we should be giving something back."</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez and Wong hope that their yoga regimen will become a model
for schools throughout the Bay Area. Their program, called ABC Yoga,
teaches children 12 poses.</TE>
<TE>   Some teachers take it a step further with the Yoga Science Box, a
curriculum designed by Wong, which incorporates yoga into lessons on
physics, geometry and anatomy.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Wong said, students can use the triangle pose
to study the Pythagorean theorem, or calculate the amount of power used
in a finger stand.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever you can integrate the curriculum with movement or with
doing other things, it just gives the kids a broader understanding,"
said Craig Strong, a third-grade teacher at the private Cathedral
School for boys in San Francisco and a yoga teacher at Sanchez's
studio.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell them, 'Make sure your leg is at a 90-degree angle or
perpendicular to the floor,' and they are learning. Or we can talk
about the muscles we are using and the respiratory system, and they
are learning."</TE>
<TE>   Program 'Helps to Center Kids'</TE>
<TE>   Gloria Siech, who heads the physical education program for the San
Francisco Unified School District, says yoga is a powerful fitness
tool for young people because it is low-stress and noncompetitive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's individual, and each kid can do it as far as they can
go.There's no keeping score, and there's nobody telling them that's
not good enough," Siech said. "It helps to center kids and helps them
concentrate. They are able to calm down and breathe, and the teachers
see the improvement immediately."</TE>
<TE>   Other schools around the country, including the Accelerated School
in South-Central Los Angeles, have introduced yoga to their students
as well. The teachers can offer no data on whether yoga helps
children learn, but they have no doubt it improves their students'
concentration.</TE>
<TE>   "To me it's amazing to see a child who has a high level of anger
or anxiety just do this and let go," said teacher Klein in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids experience very high stress, and they have anxiety
among each other and anxiety from home. They didn't understand it at
first. They would just do it because I told them to. But then I could
see them start focusing. Now they ask for yoga."</TE>
<TE>   Phyllis Camp, a physical education teacher at James Lick Middle
School, was among the first group of teachers to be trained in
Sanchez's pilot program in 1997. She has used yoga with her students
ever since, even offering after-school yoga clubs that are open to
parents and teachers as well.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so helpful at this age," Camp said. "They are finding their
bodies, and their bodies are changing so much. This helps them
appreciate the diversity around them. In one class you can have a
very tall kid and a heavy-set kid and a kid with some physical
limitations all doing the same poses. It's very unifying for them."</TE>
<TE>   Camp's sixth-grade students file into the gymnasium in their P.E.
uniforms for a brief yoga session before heading out to the yard to
play sports.</TE>
<TE>   "At first I thought yoga was going to be a religion, and I didn't
want to do the class," said 12-year-old Tanya Bendana. "Then when I
learned what it was, I liked it a lot. I got stronger. I didn't used
to have these muscles," she said, pointing to her calves. "Now they
are strong."</TE>
<TE>   Ebrahaim Algubcani said yoga has helped him to manage conflicts
with his family. "The breathing is very cool," he said. "If you're
nervous or you have a fight with your mom or dad, it makes you feel
not angry."</TE>
<TE>   "Yoga has always been able to evolve to meet the needs of the
society that practices it," Sanchez said. "This is just one more
example."</TE>
<TE>   More information about the ABC Yoga series is available at the Web
site www.usyoga.org.</TE>

<HD>El Toro Casualty: Local Elections</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHIRLEY L. GRINDLE</AU>
<BD>Shirley Grindle is a longtime community activist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When developer George Argyros fired the first shot over the bow by
successfully getting an uninformed and unsuspecting public to vote
for an international airport at El Toro, who would have predicted
that eight years and $54 million later, the county would be no closer
to building an airport than it was before the Marines left El Toro?</LD>
<LD>   The battle over the airport went beyond the Board of Supervisors.
It generated tactics that test the limits of campaign spending rules
on both sides. The drive to turn El Toro into an airport without a
doubt severely damaged the public's confidence in county government,
and it increasingly has undermined the integrity of our local
elections.</LD>
<LD>   I view this impact on local elections with concern.</LD>
<TE>   This was first detected in Irvine's November 2000 elections for
mayor and three council seats. A couple of individuals active in
Irvine politics formed a slate mailer organization called Hometown
Voter Guide.</TE>
<TE>   By labeling their efforts as a slate mailer organization, the
group was able to collect contributions from a number of anti-airport
sources far in excess of Irvine's regular limit of $310 per person.
With these funds, Hometown produced more than a dozen slate mailers
that promoted Larry Agran for mayor and Agran's endorsed candidates
for City Council--Beth Krom, Chris Mears and Anthony Dragun.</TE>
<TE>   State law could have been violated because the state Political
Reform Act clearly prohibits a candidate or officeholder from being
involved in the operation of a slate mailer organization. I've asked
the Fair Political Practices Commission to look into the matter and
determine whether any candidates were involved.</TE>
<TE>   In June 2001, the Airport Working Group, a pro-airport political
action committee supported mostly by Newport Beach residents, paid
for a series of campaign mailers in an Orange City Council election.
These mailers promoted the election of certain pro-airport candidates
and opposed those who were neutral or anti-airport. In so doing they
and some of their large contributors allegedly ran afoul of Orange's
campaign finance ordinance. The city of Orange filed charges, and the
matter is now in court.</TE>
<TE>   These events in Irvine and Orange pale by comparison, however, to
what recently occurred in the election for the 3rd District
supervisor's seat, where anti-airport candidate Chris Norby ran
against pro-airport incumbent Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad. What
happened was a joining of anti-airport forces in South County with
anti-airport candidate Norby's campaign people along with a slate
mailer organization known as the Voter Education Project. Concerned
that Norby would not be able to raise enough money to overcome the
advantage of wealthy incumbent Coad, anti-airport organizations gave
substantial funds not to Norby directly but to the Voter Education
Project, which then produced and mailed more than a dozen mailers
that supported Norby and opposed Coad.</TE>
<TE>   Since contributions to slate mailer organizations are not subject
to contribution limits, Norby's campaign was able to bypass the
county's campaign limit of $1,000 per person and simultaneously
receive the benefit of more than a dozen pieces of campaign
literature paid for by someone else.</TE>
<TE>   A legitimate slate mailer usually consists of a list of candidates
and ballot measures recommended by the organization itself. But the
Voter Education Project mailers consisted of four-page, full-color
glossy foldouts with 31/2 pages devoted to pro-Norby rhetoric and
only a small portion of the back page used for naming other slate
candidates and ballot measures. In fact, these mailers looked exactly
like campaign literature that would normally be sent out by the
candidate himself.</TE>
<TE>   According to state law, a slate mailer is defined simply as "a
mass mailing which supports or opposes a total of four or more
candidates or ballot measures." By adding at least three other names
on the back page, the mailers met the legal definition.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts are underway to analyze the legal ramifications of the
Norby campaign. But the full picture won't be known until the next
campaign disclosure reports are filed (due by the end of July), which
will provide details as to who paid for what and when.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, now that the El Toro issue appears to be resolved
with the county finally acknowledging the futility of trying to build
an international airport in the center of developed communities,
perhaps city and county elections will no longer be impacted by
campaign tactics emanating from both sides of the airport
controversy. Let us hope this will be the case.</TE>

<HD>When the Growing Gets Tough</HD>
<DH>OCTA Develops a 10-Year Roadmap to Keep O.C. Traffic
Flowing</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM KEENAN</AU>
<BD>Tim Keenan is a Cypress city councilman and vice
chairman of the Orange County Transportation Authority.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whether we want to admit it or not, the suburban Orange County that
many of us grew up with is rapidly changing into a major urban
center. We are no longer a bedroom community for Los Angeles, with
rolling orange groves, rural neighborhoods and quiet beaches.</LD>
<LD>   With more than 2.8 million residents, we are the
fourth-most-populated county in the United States--with more people
than 19 states. We average more than 3,500 people per square mile.</LD>
<LD>   This trend toward urbanization is expected to continue during the
next 25 years as Orange County is projected to grow by an additional
600,000 people and more than a half-million new jobs. Unless we make
an aggressive commitment to plan for and invest in transportation
infrastructure, this increase in population, employment and density
will have a severe impact on our county, its economy and our way of
life.</LD>
<TE>   In an effort to stay ahead of the curve and keep us out of
transportation gridlock, the Orange County Transportation Authority
is planning for the future. Recently, the OCTA board of directors
adopted an ambitious program of 10 strategic transportation
initiatives to improve Orange County mobility over the 10 years.
Implementation started immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Here are OTCA's "10 Initiatives for 10 Years":</TE>
<TE>   1. Widening the Garden Grove Freeway and the Santa Ana Freeway in
the north as quickly and efficiently as possible.</TE>
<TE>   2. Improvement of travel in the Riverside Freeway corridor.</TE>
<TE>   3. Fixing freeway bottlenecks.</TE>
<TE>   4. Encouragement of car-pooling on toll roads.</TE>
<TE>   5. Investment in local streets and roads.</TE>
<TE>   6. Expansion of Metrolink service.</TE>
<TE>   7. Expansion of bus service.</TE>
<TE>   8. Addition of express bus service.</TE>
<TE>   9. Providing new Bus Rapid Transit Service (BRT).</TE>
<TE>   10. Building a new light-rail system.</TE>
<TE>   The initiatives are an outgrowth of extensive research, public
outreach, and public opinion polling conducted by OCTA during the
last year, as well as recent discussions by the board of directors
about short- and long-term strategies for the county.</TE>
<TE>   The initiatives are expected to cost the transportation agency
$4.6 billion over the next 10 years, with $3.2 billion coming from
traditional OCTA revenue sources such as the county's Measure M sales
tax funds and about $1.4 billion from state and federal funds.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 10 years, OCTA has focused heavily on freeways. More
than $6.55 billion has been spent improving and expanding the Santa
Ana, Costa Mesa, Orange, Corona del Mar, Riverside and San Diego
freeways, as well as streets and roads.</TE>
<TE>   During the next decade we plan to continue this effort to improve
our freeway system, giving primary attention to expanding the Garden
Grove Freeway, the northern section of the Santa Ana Freeway and the
Riverside Freeway, and to fixing freeway bottlenecks.</TE>
<TE>   Congestion on the Riverside Freeway corridor has been especially
bad. This month OCTA reached agreement with the California Private
Transportation Co. to purchase the 91 Express Lanes and operational
franchise agreement. Once completed, the deal will bring public
ownership to the toll lanes, allow us to adjust rates and pave the
way for Riverside Freeway improvements by eliminating the franchise's
noncompete agreement.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA also plans to continue its heavy investment in Orange
County's local streets and roads, including projects to synchronize
signals to smooth traffic flow, improve maintenance and facilitate
grade separations at railroad crossings.</TE>
<TE>   During the next 10 years, we also plan to continue to expand
OCTA's heavily used bus system. With a record 62 million passengers
last year, we are now the 19th-largest transit agency in the country.
Our 9.5% increase from the previous year made us the fastest-growing
transit system in the United States. We look forward to continuing to
add service, increasing frequency and service hours in high-demand
areas, improving our service quality and providing more service
options for senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   We also plan to expand our Metrolink system, explore ways to make
our toll roads more efficient and continue to look at several new
concepts as part of our effort to offer a host of transportation
alternatives. Implementation of rapid transit and express bus service
within the county and between Orange and neighboring counties, and
the building of the first phase of a light-rail system in Orange
County will all be explored.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County is changing. We must be prepared to deal with this
change. We must continue to invest in our county's infrastructure and
push ourselves to explore new ideas and technology to tackle our
transportation challenges. Our county's future and our future
mobility depend on it.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ted Lilly came close to pitching Saturday's second no-hitter in the
major leagues but lost his bid and the game, too.</LD>
<LD>   Desi Relaford singled with one out in the eighth inning, driving
in the game's only run and giving the Seattle Mariners their only hit
in a 1-0 victory over the New York Yankees at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier Saturday, Boston's Derek Lowe pitched the major leagues'
first no-hitter of the season. Only once in modern major league
history have two no-hitters been thrown in one day.</LD>
<TE>   "I went at it today with everything I had and came up a little
short," Lilly said. "Obviously, I'm disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   Lilly (0-2), who had never pitched more than seven innings as a
starter in the major leagues, walked Dan Wilson with one out in the
eighth inning, and pinch-runner Luis Ugueto took second on a wild
pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Relaford then lined a single into right field on a 2-2 pitch to
easily score Ugueto. Lilly immediately backed up home, then hung his
head a little bit as he returned to the mound.</TE>
<TE>   Freddy Garcia (3-2) gave up five hits in eight innings, struck out
eight and walked one, and Kazuhiro Sasaki finished for his seventh
save in eight chances.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Jeter singled with one out in the ninth and Robin Ventura
walked with two outs, but Sasaki struck out Rondell White to end the
game.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly struck out eight and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   After hitting Jeff Cirillo with a pitch in Seattle's second
at-bat, Lilly retired 17 consecutive batters before plunking Cirillo
again in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   The only day since 1900 there ever were two major league
no-hitters thrown was June 29, 1990, when Oakland's Dave Stewart
accomplished the feat against Toronto and the Dodgers' Fernando
Valenzuela did it against St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 16, Chicago 1--Scott Hatteberg, Terrence Long, Carlos Pena
and Frank Menechino all homered in a seven-run third inning as the
A's won at Oakland. The four-homer inning matched the franchise
record. The last time the A's hit as many was Aug. 1, 1999, against
Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Hatteberg hit a solo home run, Long added a three-run shot to
right and Pena hit another solo homer off Mark Buehrle (4-2).
Menechino added a two-run home run on Michael Porzio's first pitch in
relief to give the A's a 9-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The A's, who had 19 hits, have homered in 14 consecutive games and
lead the majors with 40 home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 4, Cleveland 2--Rob Bell won his first start of the season
and Alex Rodriguez drove in two runs to lead the Rangers at
Arlington, Texas. Bell (1-0), recalled before the game from Triple-A
Oklahoma, gave up one run and four hits in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland's Ellis Burks, who grew up in nearby Fort Worth, hit a
solo homer in the eighth off Rudy Seanez, giving him home runs in 40
ballparks, the most in major league history. Fred McGriff and Mark
McGwire homered in 39 ballparks.</TE>
<TE>   Tigers 5, Twins 1--Rookie Nate Cornejo pitched his first career
complete game in the major leagues, giving up nine hits, striking out
eight and walking one for the Tigers at Detroit. Randall Simon
homered and drove in three runs and Bobby Higginson drove in two runs
and scored twice for Detroit. The Tigers won for the third time in
four games while Minnesota has lost four of five.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 9, Kansas City 4--Tony Batista homered twice and drove
in five runs, giving him nine RBIs in two games and 23 this season as
the Orioles won at Kansas City, Mo. Melvin Mora and Geronimo Gil also
homered to help Sidney Ponson (1-1) win for the first time in eight
decisions. The Orioles, who have won six of eight after starting
4-11, scored their first seven runs with two outs.</TE>

<HD>Angels on the Money in Win</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Sele finally gets first victory, and offensive
revival continues with Eckstein's grand slam and Glaus' three RBIs as
Anaheim beats Blue Jays, 11-4.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aaron Sele cashed in ahead for the first time this season. David
Eckstein showed that he's not always a small-change player. Troy
Glaus continued to be a money player ... at least at the plate.</LD>
<LD>   Footing that bill were the Toronto Blue Jays, who provided plenty
of silver-platter opportunities Saturday in the Angels' 11-4 victory
in front of 29,112 at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   Glaus drove in three runs and Eckstein's first career grand slam
finished off a seven-run fifth inning that secured a season-high
three-game winning streak for the Angels. The big winner, though, was
Sele, who allowed only one earned run in 52/3 innings for his first
victory as an Angel.</LD>
<TE>   Sele was to be part of the solution, not the problem, when he
signed a three-year, $24-million contract during the off-season. But
his body of work this season before Saturday had resembled that of
someone in a lower tax bracket.</TE>
<TE>   He came into the game 0-2 with a 6.65 earned-run average, although
he had shown improvement in his last two starts, pitching into the
seventh inning and allowing only three earned runs both times. Yet,
all he had to show for it were two no-decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't play this game for money or for contracts," Manager
Mike Scioscia said. "It's not like he was making the minimum salary
where he was before. The bigger issue is coming into a new situation
feeling uncomfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Sele feels a little more at ease after getting that first victory.
Maybe it wasn't a masterpiece--he allowed four runs, nine hits and
two walks--but three of the runs were unearned. So this was something
to build on.</TE>
<TE>   "I think some of his adjustments have come a little more gradual
and are not eye-opening things," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   The eye-openers came at the plate for the Angels, who are
beginning to show some offensive fortitude.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel right now the pattern we've shown the last couple games
will pay dividends," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   A team's stock tends to rise when facing the Blue Jays' pitching
staff. Toronto entered the game with the highest ERA in the major
leagues (6.48). Blue Jay pitchers lived up to that number, although
they were hurt by a few shoddy plays in the field.</TE>
<TE>   The 11 runs were a season high for an Angel team that has
struggled for offensive consistency since the season began, yet has
averaged more than six runs in the last eight games.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe we are a good offensive team," first baseman Scott
Spiezio said. "You go down our lineup and you see the talent there.
It's just a matter of getting things rolling. In the last week we've
started to see guys getting hits in key situations."</TE>
<TE>   That is expected of Glaus, the Angel RBI leader. His three runs
batted in Saturday game him nine in his last eight games. He has it
.406 in that stretch.</TE>
<TE>   The unexpected punch came from Eckstein, whose role in the Angel
batting order before Saturday was easily defined.</TE>
<TE>   Hit by pitches: 6. Extra-base hits: 3.</TE>
<TE>   But with the Angels leading, 7-4, in the fifth, Eckstein jumped on
a 1-2 pitch from Scotty Cassidy, sending a low drive that barely
cleared the left-field fence near the foul line.His home run fit well
into a game of highlights and lowlights.</TE>
<TE>   Highlight: Darin Fletcher had a two-run double in Toronto's
three-run first inning.</TE>
<TE>   Lowlight: All three runs were unearned, as Glaus booted a grounder
that could have been an inning-ending double play.</TE>
<TE>   Highlight: Glaus redeemed himself with a two-run single in the
bottom of the first.</TE>
<TE>   Lowlight: The table was set when Blue Jay starter Justin Martin
walked the first three batters.</TE>
<TE>   Highlight: Eckstein's grand slam finished off a seven-run fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Lowlight: The inning got rolling when Blue Jay first baseman
Carlos Delgado mishandled Garret Anderson's weak liner, which could
have been an easy double play.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Erstad Is Cleared to Return Today</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For once, the best-case scenario worked out for the Angels. Center
fielder Darin Erstad is expected to return to the lineup today, nine
days after suffering a concussion while attempting to make a diving
catch.</LD>
<LD>   Erstad went through extensive workouts Friday and Saturday, then
was cleared to play today.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel good and I'm ready to go [today]," Erstad said. "I've
passed all the tests."</LD>
<TE>   Erstad will return to center field, Manager Mike Scioscia said. He
will also return with the same aggressive style of play.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought about it before, but that's just the way I play,"
Erstad said. "I'm not going to stop doing that. I couldn't even try,
I don't think."</TE>
<TE>   His return will cause some lineup juggling. Orlando Palmeiro has
been a spark plug for the Angels while playing for Erstad. Palmeiro
is hitting .361 and has a six-game hitting streak.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone sits, it's not like a season-ending decision,"
Scioscia said. "We can mix and match until we get this offense going
on a consistent basis. Then there's always a possibility of going
back to a set lineup if all the pieces start to function."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Troy Percival made his reputation with his heat, a 96- to 98-mph
fastball. Yet it was his curveball that got the Angels out of a
bases-loaded jam in the ninth Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Percival struck out Raul Mondesi and Carlos Delgado to end the
game, both on curveballs.</TE>
<TE>   "The two seasons I was injured, I couldn't throw it," Percival
said. "But for the last 11/2 seasons I probably have thrown just as
many strikes with the curve as the fastball."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Shawn Wooten will pick up a bat next week for the
first time since tearing a ligament in his right thumb on May 13. He
will take "dry swings," without hitting a ball, and hopes to start
taking batting practice in the next couple weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting back here in June is starting to look like a realistic
thing," Wooten said.</TE>
<TE>   Wooten was originally scheduled to go to Arizona next week to
begin workouts, but those plans were altered. He will remain in
Southern California instead.</TE>

<HD>Here's Missing Persons Report</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe it's only a handful of games and not a true trend. Maybe it's
only April showers and not an accurate warning of a gathering storm.</LD>
<LD>   Seventeen of the 30 major league teams, including eight that play
in comparatively new ballparks, showed an attendance decrease as they
entered the final weekend of the first month.</LD>
<LD>   The decreases range from about 2,000 for the Chicago White Sox to
about 95,000 for the Texas Rangers.</LD>
<TE>   Overall attendance is down about 4%--a blip, perhaps, that will be
corrected during warmer summer months. After all, it was only two
years ago that baseball set an attendance record, drawing 73 million.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, however, it's symptomatic of an increasingly skeptical and
fragile fan base that can partially be measured by last year's
200,000 falloff.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the sputtering turnstiles should represent a drumbeat to
management and union labor negotiators, a warning that another work
stoppage would be difficult--if not impossible--to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   As Rick Burton, executive director of the University of Oregon's
Warsaw Sports Marketing Center, put it: "I just don't think baseball
can take another hit, but the message, as I read it, is that most
industry executives continue to think the game is infallible, will
always survive, you can't kill it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's horribly flawed thinking."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball's chief operating officer suggests Burton may be getting
the wrong message.</TE>
<TE>   Robert DuPuy said concern about the industry's potential
fallibility is what drives the clubs' pursuit of an economic system
that would aid competitive balance and that both sides are cognizant
of the risk of another shutdown.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question both sides recognize the devastation the last
prolonged work stoppage did and are determined to avoid it if
possible," DuPuy said. "I think it's the one thing that gives you
hope we'll make a deal.</TE>
<TE>   "Both sides realize we got lucky [last time]. Who knows if we'd
get that lucky again? Everybody's scared about that. Everybody's
concerned about it."</TE>
<TE>   Lucky last time?</TE>
<TE>   Lucky, he meant, in the sense that Cal Ripken's Jr.'s pursuit of
Lou Gehrig's record for consecutive games, the New York Yankees'
return to dominance and the Mark McGwire/Sammy Sosa home run races
helped lift baseball out of the ashes of the 1994-95 stoppage and--in
concert with the wave of new ballparks--generated an attendance boom
of 70 million plus in each of the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   However, Burton said much of that rebirth has been "squandered."</TE>
<TE>   He cited soaring salaries and ticket prices, the inability to
avoid negative, headline-usurping labor issues and the competitive
balance mantra that has served to convince some fans in some cities,
although certainly not the union, that there's no hope.</TE>
<TE>   He called it a confluence of issues over several years, and said,
"Now, for the first time in a long time, there's no new teams or new
stadiums to cover the spreading problems."</TE>
<TE>   David Carter of the Los Angeles-based Sports Business Group
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   He said it would be a mistake for baseball to believe it holds the
relevant position it once did, that "a lot of fans have simply become
jaded and cynical about what the sport has to offer right now."</TE>
<TE>   In particular, he said, "Middle-aged fans who have been through a
couple work stoppages and now may face another are simply fed up,
and, of course, that tends to spill over to their kids and younger
fans who have a lot of other options."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe all of this, the specter of doom and gloom, is a little
premature.</TE>
<TE>   The weather always affects attendance in April, as does the fact
that schools are still in session. The struggling economy is a
factor, and many fans may remain distracted by the terrorist attacks
of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The heat of summer, the prospect of tight races, the possibility
of Barry Bonds, Sosa, Alex Rodriguez or some other player providing a
spectacular individual performance, could start turnstiles spinning.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are troublesome signs. For example:</TE>
<TE>   * The Pittsburgh Pirates, who led the National League Central
entering the weekend, and Milwaukee Brewers, both blessed with
second-year ballparks, have experienced among the largest attendance
decreases.</TE>
<TE>   * The Atlanta Braves have set a series of Turner Field attendance
lows, and the Montreal Expos, unable to escape the shadow of
contraction and the apathy of their community despite a stunning
start, drew another season low--3,501--while winning their sixth
consecutive game Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   * The Cleveland Indians are down almost 75,000 at Jacobs Field,
where until last year they played to only sellouts, and there are
empty seats on a daily basis at the former hotbeds of Camden Yards,
Coors Field and The Ballpark at Arlington.</TE>
<TE>   All of this against the backdrop of another season of labor
rhetoric, the possibility of a late-summer strike if the union
believes owners intend to unilaterally implement new work rules when
the World Series ends, and the probability that there will be no
meaningful negotiations until arbitrator Shyam Das, in late June or
beyond, rules on the union's contraction grievance.</TE>
<TE>   For Commissioner Bud Selig, the loss of faith and hope in too many
cities plays into the attendance figures, but, he said, "You can't
make a judgment this early. Look, it's possible amid a flattening
economy we may not set an attendance record every year, but do I
think we have a serious problem? No. Do I watch every day and worry
about it? Yes. When you quit worrying about your customers you're in
trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Selig said he worries about it to the extent that it guides his
daily thinking on the labor front. If convinced the system has to
change to improve competitive balance, he understands the risk in a
ninth work stoppage.</TE>
<TE>   Will the risk and worry outweigh the conviction that change is
needed?</TE>
<TE>   That's as unlikely as a sellout in Montreal.</TE>

<LD>Although it is said in baseball that some of the best trades are
those not made, it would have been hard to convince General Manager
Ken Williams and his Chicago White Sox staff of that at the winter
baseball meetings in December when they thought they had made a trade
for Darin Erstad of the Angels only to have Disney executive Paul
Pressler nullify it. That decision undermined Angel General Manager
Bill Stoneman and left Williams and the White Sox steaming.</LD>
<LD>   Now?</LD>
<LD>   Well, Williams might send Pressler a thank-you card.</LD>
<TE>   Although the White Sox general manager cautiously skirts tampering
rules and says he still has "tremendous respect for the player you're
talking about," it's hard to believe Erstad, still trying to regain
his 2000 form with the Angels, would be doing more as the leadoff
hitter for an explosive White Sox attack than center fielder Kenny
Lofton has.</TE>
<TE>   Lofton started a weekend series at Oakland leading the major
leagues in batting average (.398), runs and stolen bases, proving to
the Cleveland Indians and others that his falloff of the last two
years--a career-low .278 in 2000 followed by an even lower .261 last
year--was the result of injuries, that he wasn't through at 34.</TE>
<TE>   "He's doing what we envisioned [Erstad] would have done," Williams
said. "The concept [of a catalytic leadoff hitter] is what we were
attempting to address. Which player we acquired to fill the concept
was secondary. As I recall, I'm sure we had called Kenny [a free
agent] early in the process, even before reaching out to the Angels.
The price [for Lofton] was a little too high at the start, but as
time passed it became more of a fit."</TE>
<TE>   In a cold market, the White Sox signed Lofton to a one-year
contract for the bargain price of $1.03 million, with $375,000 in
performance bonuses. Now they are considering an extension.</TE>
<TE>   Lofton has brought balance and creativity to the White Sox
lineup--"This is the most unselfish, team-oriented group I've ever
been around," Williams said--and Manager Jerry Manuel can't believe
his good fortune or how Lofton could have been available for so long
given the importance of a proven leadoff hitter and a player "who
does all of the same things as [Ichiro Suzuki] in Seattle."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the White Sox didn't have to give up the unidentified
prospect they were going to include in the deal for Erstad, or
pitcher Jon Garland, who has won three of his first four decisions
this season, or center fielder Chris Singleton, although they
eventually traded Singleton to the Baltimore Orioles for minor league
second baseman Willie Harris.</TE>
<TE>   Singleton started the weekend hitting .132, so maybe the Angels
also can say that some of the best trades are those that aren't made.</TE>
<TE>   Notebook</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to figure out what the Colorado Rockies expected of
Buddy Bell during his two-plus years at the helm before firing him.
One minute they're splurging on free agents, as typified by last
year's $172-million investment in Mike Hampton and Denny Neagle (who
are a combined 25-25 as Rockies) and the next they're slashing roster
and payroll, as typified by this year's $15-million reduction and
decision to play inexperienced Juan Uribe and Jose Ortiz in the
middle of the infield.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies put 89 players in uniform during Bell's tenure, making
it difficult to establish stability and continuity. Still, sources
close to the Colorado situation say the firing of Bell and
appointment of hitting coach Clint Hurdle as manager was a move that
had to be made.</TE>
<TE>   In the final year of a three-year contract, Bell's disappointment
at not getting an off-season extension seemed to linger into the
season, although a better start by Hampton, 0-3 with an 8.88
earned-run average, and Todd Helton and Larry Walker in the middle of
the lineup might have saved his job.</TE>
<TE>   Hurdle, meantime, never fulfilled the phenom expectations as a
player that his early Sports Illustrated cover projected, but his
baseball acumen is widely respected. He was General Manager Jerry
Hunsicker's choice for the Houston Astros' managing job before
ownership insisted on a manager with big league experience and Jimy
Williams was hired, and he was among final candidates for the Arizona
Diamondback job before Bob Brenly moved from the broadcasting booth
to the dugout....</TE>
<TE>   Pedro Martinez might not be back to his Cy Young Award best, but
he's closing in, having yielded only two hits and striking out 22 in
his last 181/3 innings, which includes Thursday's 7-0 victory over
the Baltimore Orioles. It's now apparent that the only thing the
Boston Red Sox ace had to fear in his recovery from shoulder
tendinitis was fear itself, or as Manager Grady Little put it: "Once
he got past some scared feelings of his own, he went to work on his
command, and he just keeps getting better and better." ...</TE>
<TE>   Speculation that Ken Griffey Jr., sidelined by a torn knee tendon,
would be returning to the Cincinnati Reds' lineup during a three-game
series at Dodger Stadium starting Tuesday is inaccurate. Griffey is
still about 10 days away, although he does about 31/2 miles of bike
work a day....</TE>
<TE>   The Milwaukee Brewers are said to have narrowed their managerial
search to interim Manager Jerry Royster, Arizona bench coach Bob
Melvin and longtime Brewer Cecil Cooper, who came out of the front
office to serve as Royster's bench coach....</TE>
<TE>   It's no longer Enron Field, and the inconsistent Houston Astros
are searching for an identity as well, or as first baseman Jeff
Bagwell said: "This is starting out just like last year, where we
were floundering around and not able to do anything. There just
doesn't seem to be any feel to who we are. We don't have an identity,
and we need one."</TE>

<HD>Knee Injury Puts Suzuki on Bench</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leadoff hitter Ichiro Suzuki was not in the Seattle lineup for
Saturday night's game against the New York Yankees because of an
injured left knee.</LD>
<LD>   It marks the first game Suzuki did not start because of injury in
his major league career. The right fielder played in 157 games in
2001.</LD>
<LD>   Suzuki, last year's American League most valuable player and
rookie of the year, left Friday's game at the start of the seventh
inning with a cut on his left knee. He ran into the fence in foul
territory while trying to catch a fly ball by Ron Coomer in the
fourth inning.</LD>
<TE>   He had four stitches Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Suzuki was held out of the lineup for precautionary reasons,
Manager Lou Piniella said, and was undergoing treatment before the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure he's stiff and sore," Piniella said.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Cameron was in the leadoff spot Saturday and Charles Gipson
replaced Suzuki in right field.</TE>
<TE>   Suzuki might play in the final game of the three-game series
today, Piniella said, and is certainly expected back by Tuesday when
Seattle plays the White Sox at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners have adjusted to injuries to other key players.
Designated hitter Edgar Martinez is on the disabled list after April
13 surgery on his right hamstring to remove a ruptured tendon. He is
expected to be out at least a month.</TE>
<TE>   "What makes this club good is that we have a lot of guys who can
help us win a ballgame," first baseman John Olerud said. "Hopefully
we'll turn it up a notch and make up for Ichiro being out."</TE>
<TE>   Suzuki forces pitchers to throw a lot of pitches. He faced a full
count in the fifth inning against Roger Clemens on Friday and fouled
off five consecutive pitches before getting a hit.</TE>
<TE>   "He is some player. He wasn't going to take a pitch unless it was
to the press box," Yankee Manager Joe Torre said. "It's tough to
enjoy [his talent] because it's against me. But I admire what he
does."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta outfielder B.J. Surhoff injured his right knee in the
ninth inning of the Braves' 6-3 loss to the Houston Astros.</TE>
<TE>   Brave trainer Dave Pursley did not know the extent of the injury,
and Manager Bobby Cox said two orthopedists were to examine Surhoff,
whose knee was wrapped in ice.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll cross our fingers," Cox said. "He's been playing great.
He's played super right field."</TE>
<TE>   X-rays were inconclusive and Surhoff probably will undergo more
tests today at Piedmont Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Surhoff slid into the wall at Turner Field and appeared to jam the
leg while trying to field Gregg Zaun's triple into the right-field
corner. Still on the ground on the warning track, Surhoff threw to
second baseman Marcus Giles, who relayed the ball home in time to

<HD>They Pass on Cheeks' Instructions</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Trail Blazers will attempt to more closely follow Coach Maurice
Cheeks' game plan today in Game 3 at the Rose Garden. So far, they
would appear to have let Cheeks' instructions to pass the ball inside
to Rasheed Wallace and Bonzi Wells go in one ear and out the other.</LD>
<LD>   Portland has made 62 of 162 shots (38.3%) in the series. The
Lakers have made 71 of 153 (46.4%) and lead the best-of-five series
by two games to none.</LD>
<LD>   "Jump shot after jump shot," Cheeks told the Oregonian newspaper.
"For three days [between Games 1 and 2], we practiced posting up,
then the day comes for us to actually do it and we don't do it. We
shoot jump shots. That part is puzzling to me."</LD>
<TE>   Wells and Damon Stoudamire, the Trail Blazers' starting guards,
have been the biggest rim-busters. Wells is seven for 23 in the first
two games of the series and Stoudamire is two for 15.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his guards' poor shooting, Cheeks plans to make no changes
to his starting lineup today.</TE>
<TE>   "They have had wide-open shots, but they just haven't made them,"
Cheeks said, referring to Wells and Stoudamire. "All you can do is
keep putting the ball in their hands and keep letting them take the
same shots."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   His team's lack of composure in Game 2 remained a source of dismay
for Cheeks, renowned in his playing days as one of the game's most
unflappable performers. The Trail Blazers drew four technical fouls
and one flagrant foul in the second half of Thursday's seven-point
loss against the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers made all four free throws after the technical fouls,
sank both free throws after Ruben Patterson clobbered Shaquille
O'Neal with 5:46 remaining, then made a basket after retaining
possession.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't understand it," Cheeks said. "Frustration is part of
basketball, but to give them eight points on technicals [and a
flagrant foul] is a problem for us and that's what dissatisfied me
most about that game.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to win a playoff game and that's not the way we're
going to do it."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have been particularly frustrating for Trail Blazer
center Dale Davis to face. Davis has fouled out twice and been
ejected twice in four playoff games with the Trail Blazers against
the Lakers in the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cheeks sounded as hopeful as could be expected going into what
could be the final game of the season for his team. He reminded
reporters of the Lakers' inconsistent play at times during the
regular season, hoping to see more of it today.</TE>
<TE>   "They've lost some games throughout the year, so certainly someone
has stopped them," he said. "And somebody for them has missed shots,
and they have done things to allow other teams to win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers have lost six consecutive playoff games to the
Lakers, including their fourth-quarter collapse in Game 7 of the
Western Conference finals in 2000.</TE>

<LD>Steve Spurrier says he doesn't intend to change his nine-to-five
workday now that he's the coach of the Washington Redskins.</LD>
<LD>   "He managed to become one of college football's most successful
coaches at Florida and still get in about five rounds of golf a
week," writes Paul Domowitch of the Knight Ridder News Service.
"Usually made it home during the season by 7 o'clock. Can that
approach work in the bop-till-you drop NFL? We're about to find out.</LD>
<LD>   "If Spurrier ends up winning the Super Bowl with his nine-to-five
approach, a lot of NFL coaches are going to have an awful lot of
explaining to do to their wives and kids."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Spurrier: "I hope he wins," Denver Bronco Coach Mike Shanahan
said. "I can [then] go home at 5:30."</TE>

LaRusso and Frank Selvy have in common?</TE>

<TE>   Remember this? The American Le Mans Series, founded in 1999, stirs
fond movie memories for Liz Clarke of the Washington Post: "Steve
McQueen had top billing, but the real stars of the movie 'Le Mans'
were his Porsche 917K and its rival Ferrari 512S, whose sleek lines
and screaming engines made the film an instant classic among auto
racing fans.</TE>
<TE>   "The 1971 movie captured the golden age of sports car racing, in
which dashing men and exotic machines tested their limits at
breakneck speed through blinding rain and dead of night on the famed
course that snakes through the French countryside."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He's in good company: Jim McCabe in the Boston Globe, on Tiger
Woods after his Masters victory: "He just played in his 21st major
and earned his seventh title. Jack Nicklaus had six victories in his
first 21 majors, but he won again in his 22nd [the 1967 U.S. Open],
so if Woods fails to triumph at Bethpage Black [course] in June, the
match will be all square."</TE>

<TE>   No field of dreams: More of the 50 worst sports ideas ever from
Patrick Hruby of the Washington Times:</TE>
<TE>   * "Astroturf: giver of injuries; taker of careers; an aesthetic
atrocity that looks lousy on television and even worse in person.</TE>
<TE>   "Since its debut in 1965, artificial turf has been responsible for
a multitude of sporting sins, including dome baseball and the
cancellation of a Baltimore-Philadelphia NFL preseason game. Imagine
a Wimbledon played on the synthetic stuff. The horror."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Why bother: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle: "Sports
Illustrated is having a garage sale, unloading Charles Barkley's
opinions for a nickel each. Bet you can bargain 'em down."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FYI: The Toronto Raptors are only the third team in NBA history to
lose 13 consecutive games in a season and still make the playoffs.
The others are the 1996-97 Phoenix Suns, who opened the season at
0-13, and the 1976-77 Chicago Bulls.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Roberts Working His Way Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>The question started popping up when leadoff batter Dave Roberts'
batting average dropped to .216 last Sunday. Would the Dodgers be
better off with shortstop Cesar Izturis hitting first, Marquis
Grissom batting second and playing center field and Roberts on the
bench?</LD>
<LD>   Manager Jim Tracy stressed that 50 at-bats was too early to judge
Roberts, that he "wasn't ready to pull the trigger on something like
that this quickly." Those may have been just the words to soothe
Roberts, a center fielder who is in his ninth professional season but
first as a big league starter.</LD>
<LD>   Roberts was batting .236 with a .311 on-base percentage starting a
weekend series against the Chicago Cubs, but after doubling and
walking four times in the Dodgers' 10-0 win Friday, he is batting
.246 with a .368 on-base percentage.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers' game against the Cubs at Wrigley Field was rained out
Saturday and will be made up as part of a 10 a.m. doubleheader today,
when Roberts will have another chance to reward his manager's faith
in him.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have the head of the ship in your corner giving you
words of encouragement, it alleviates a lot of pressure," Roberts
said.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts hasn't exactly driven the ball lately--his first-inning
double Friday was a grounder poked down the right-field line--but he
may have gained just as much confidence from his four walks Friday as
he would have from four singles.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, a four-walk game might even be better than a four-hit
game because it means I'm seeing seven, eight, nine pitches an
at-bat," Roberts said. "When you can do that and get on base, it's a
great thing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ashby was scheduled to start Saturday's game and Kazuhisa
Ishii today's game, but Tracy flip-flopped the rotation for today's
doubleheader. Ishii, the Japanese left-hander, will start Game 1 and
Ashby will start the second game.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason is we have a guy [Ashby] coming back from [elbow]
surgery," Tracy said. "The trainers worked on him [Saturday,
preparing him for the game] and they'll have to do it again [today].
This gives him a little more time physically and mentally to prepare
himself."</TE>
<TE>   Doubleheaders can be taxing on bullpens, but the Dodger relief
corps is in excellent shape, thanks to Odalis Perez's complete-game
one-hitter Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't had a bullpen guy take a jacket off for two days,"
Tracy said. "We have long relievers, situational relievers, short
relievers. We have all our weapons in place and another day off
Monday. We're in better position than we were [Friday] because of the
complete game."</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Omar Daal, who has made two starts in place of injured
right-hander Kevin Brown, will also be available in relief today
because it appears he'll be back in the bullpen Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Brown threw 90 pitches Saturday, taking a nine-minute break after
the first 40 pitches to simulate game-like conditions, and reported
no stiffness or pain in his elbow. There was minimal residual
swelling in the elbow, but that shouldn't prevent him from coming off
the disabled list and starting Tuesday night against Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Daal threw six innings Wednesday night, giving up one run on five
hits in a 5-1 victory, and has had three days rest going into today's
doubleheader. He could throw three or four innings in relief if
needed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As Tracy thought more about Perez's performance Friday, when the
23-year-old left-hander faced the minimum 27 batters and came within
one bad-hop infield single of pitching a perfect game, it occurred to
him that "it ranked right up there as one of the best games" in
Wrigley Field's long history.</TE>
<TE>   It also may have cemented Perez's reputation as one of the game's
rising young pitching stars and fueled even higher expectations for
his future.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy is a pitcher, he's polished," Tracy said. "If he has a
good idea of what he's doing at age 23 and is working on polishing
the polish, that equates to potentially a very good career, to being
the ace of someone's staff."</TE>
<TE>   Perez's fastball tops out at about 91 mph, so he's not
overpowering, but he has a nice slider and changeup, he's not afraid
to pitch inside, and he has consistently worked ahead in counts.</TE>
<TE>   "Strike one is a beautiful thing, not just for Odalis but for
everyone on our staff," Tracy said. "It opens up so many avenues for
a pitcher if you have a repertoire to offer opposing hitters. You
can't pitch from behind and succeed in the big leagues. You may be
able to get by, but you won't succeed."</TE>

<HD>A Rapid-Fire Loss for Galaxy</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five games into the Major League Soccer season, Carlos Ruiz is still
the only member of the Galaxy to score a goal.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately for the Galaxy, the rookie forward's four-game
scoring streak came to an end Saturday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Colorado forward John Spencer did score, however, his goal giving
the Rapids a 1-0 overtime victory in front of 13,087, handing the
Galaxy its first loss of the season and ending L.A.'s 10-game winning
streak against the Rapids at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   Spencer's goal, a slow-rolling shot from 22 yards at the top of
the box, found the back left corner of the net 3:21 into the extra
period. It barely eluded a diving Kevin Hartman, who was making his
first start in goal this season.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Galaxy's ninth consecutive overtime game, five of them
this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of my thoughts are unprintable," Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid
said. "I thought for sure this was our worst game of the season. I
didn't think we played well at all. There's guys missing, obviously,
but we play with the guys that are healthy."</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy (2-1-2) played without injured starters Mauricio
Cienfuegos (left ankle sprain), Ezra Hendrickson (right hamstring
strain), Peter Vagenas (lower back strain) and Chris Albright (broken
right foot).</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Galaxy outshot the Rapids, 21-8. Colorado (3-2-1) and
the Galaxy were even in shots on goal, 6-6.</TE>
<TE>   "The first 20 minutes were all L.A.," said Colorado Coach Tim
Hankinson. "They should have taken advantage of us at that moment
because we seemed to be struggling in finding our game. We weren't
getting players around the ball ... and that's when they really had
us pinned down."</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy and Ruiz, the league's leading scorer with 12 points on
six goals, nearly took a 1-0 lead in the fifth minute.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie midfielder Gavin Glinton was beating Rapid defender Ritchie
Kotschau down the right side when he launched a cross-field pass to
an open Ruiz creeping in from the left.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz's header, though, went over the crossbar.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy also missed a chance in the 34th minute when Glinton,
who had gotten behind the Rapid defense and was on mark for a goal,
was called offside by referee Kevin Terry.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't the sendoff Galaxy midfielder Cobi Jones expected.</TE>
<TE>   "Both teams were going at it pretty hard physically," said Jones,
who will leave the Galaxy for at least seven MLS games to join the
U.S. national team in preparation for the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they had a bit better of the play than we did. It was a
situation where we got unlucky. We always seem to give up a sloppy
goal and we did it once again."</TE>
<TE>   Jones assumed the role of playmaking midfielder with Cienfuegos
sitting out against the Rapids.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm comfortable in the middle," Jones said. "I just think we need
a little bit more offensively. If Cien's out and I have to come into
the middle, then I think we need some other people to come up. When
you look up and all you see is Ruiz and [Brian] Mullan with four guys
in the back, it makes it very difficult. You need other options."</TE>
<TE>   Without Jones, the Galaxy needs to find another scoring threat.
And it will have to do it away from home; the team's next five MLS
games are on the road.</TE>

<TE>   In other MLS games:</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 1, New York-New Jersey 1--Clint Mathis scored a goal in

<HD>Harvick Is Not Bad at All in IROC Win</HD>
<DH>Motor racing: Tempestuous Winston Cup driver behaves
himself, holds off Labonte for his first victory in series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kevin Harvick walked into the media room Saturday night and declared,
"I've been worse."</LD>
<LD>   Harvick, who grew up in Bakersfield and is NASCAR's reigning bad
boy, definitely has been. But he was Mr. Clean on Saturday, racing
aggressively but fairly, and dominating the True Value International
Race of Champions.</LD>
<LD>   Harvick, on probation for the rest of the season for rough
driving, started fourth in the field of 12 drivers, took the lead on
the first lap and led 46 of 50 laps around the two-mile California
Speedway oval. He is the first IROC rookie to win since Jeff Burton
won at Michigan International Speedway in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   "Right at the beginning, I knew I needed to be out in front and
halfway in control of [my] own destiny," said Harvick, who whipped
past the front row of Dale Jarrett and Indianapolis 500 champion
Helio Castroneves, and No. 3 starter Buddy Lazier.</TE>
<TE>   Harvick staved off challenges from Winston Cup regulars Bobby
Labonte and Tony Stewart. Labonte led laps 9 and 10, and Stewart laps
28 and 29.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's got a little something to prove right now," Jarrett
said of Harvick, who denied he has anything to prove.</TE>
<TE>   "I just go out there and try to win the race," Harvick said. "It's
really neat to race against these guys from the other divisions."</TE>
<TE>   Harvick certainly earned it on the final lap. Labonte took the
unofficial lead along the back straight on the last lap, but he
didn't have enough to put away Harvick, who was inside and closed the
door on Labonte between turns 3 and 4.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I'd save the right front [tire]," Labonte said. "Kevin,
with about 10 laps to go, started to pull away, so I started using my
right front [driving harder]. I was going to wait until the last
minute, but I couldn't make it. Not in Turn 3. I had to lift or I'd
have taken out the wall in Turn 4."</TE>
<TE>   Labonte finished second, Jarrett third, Sterling Marlin fourth and
Jack Sprague, who is running the Busch series this year, fifth--a
clean sweep by NASCAR drivers, with Winston Cup regulars taking the
top four spots in a field that included five drivers from the
open-wheel Indy Racing League.</TE>
<TE>   In the first of four IROC races this season, open-wheel drivers
finished second, third and fifth at Daytona.</TE>
<TE>   With two races remaining, Stewart retains the lead in the series
with 35 points, followed by Harvick with 32, Labonte with 30 and
Sprague tied with Al Unser Jr. with 22 points.</TE>

<DH>Abdul-Jabbar, Who Has Struggled for Years in His Attempt to
Become a Coach, Gets a Shot With Minor League Team</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OKLAHOMA CITY</DL>
<LD>It is the last Saturday night in April. Sooner football, the next
thing to a religion in this state, is months away. So the locals
wander in to Cox Convention Center Arena to check out the new guys in
town, the Oklahoma Storm of the U.S. Basketball League.</LD>
<LD>   About 2,500 people pay for an $8 or $12 seat--the elite pay $25 to
sit courtside--and scatter throughout an arena that seats 14,000.
They cheer for Randy Duck and Doug Gottlieb and Sterling Davis and
Albert White and Gabe Frank and the rest of the good guys wearing
home red. And they boo Fred Warrick and Kenny Gregory and Skip
Youngblood and the rest of the visiting Dodge City Legend.</LD>
<LD>   But their attention never strays far from the legend in their
midst, the new coach of the Storm, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. It is he who
gets the biggest cheers, the most autograph requests, the largest
number of hands extended.</LD>
<TE>   And for the first time in his life, he is really enjoying it.</TE>
<TE>   Half a continent removed from the city of his greatest glory and a
world apart from the life of privilege he lived for so long,
Abdul-Jabbar, at 55, has come to this city of nearly half a million
to reinvent himself and carve out a new role in the game he so long
dominated.</TE>
<TE>   Denied an opportunity to coach in the NBA or at a major college
largely because of the perception that he lacks the personality to be
a leader, Abdul-Jabbar has come to the minor leagues to prove his
doubters wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thankful for the opportunity," Abdul-Jabbar says. "The people
here have been real nice. Nothing crazy, but they honk when they see
me on the street and they are real friendly."</TE>
<TE>   His biggest fan is James Bryant, the Oklahoma lawyer who owns the
team and hired Abdul-Jabbar.</TE>
<TE>   "He reminds me of my history professor," Bryant says. "He's not an
intellectual athlete. He's an intellectual. I can see where he easily
might have been misunderstood in the world of professional
basketball."</TE>
<TE>   So what brought Abdul-Jabbar back to basketball?</TE>
<TE>   "They say even old fire horses can still hear the bells," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He is working his way slowly into the job, using five assistant
coaches to carry much of the load, both in terms of strategy and team
motivation.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the coolness toward Abdul-Jabbar was generated by the
stoic silence he showed the world both on and off the court. He knows
that won't cut it in the coaching profession, and, if Saturday night
is any indication, he has undergone a personality change.</TE>
<TE>   On the bench, Abdul-Jabbar is animated and vocal, barking orders,
waving his arms and opening his eyes wide in enthusiasm at the good
moments and shaking his head dejectedly at the bad. He even finds
time to come over to the scorer's table to chide play-by-play
announcer Robert Allen for not eating his dinner.</TE>
<TE>   The Storm holds on to win when Eric Coley blocks a Warrick shot in
the final seconds. Abdul-Jabbar runs off the court, left fist in the
air, as if the Lakers had just beaten the Boston Celtics to win the
NBA championship.</TE>
<TE>   Is this really the Abdul-Jabbar so many came to know and not love?</TE>
<TE>   Giving the Silent Treatment</TE>
<TE>   "As big as he is, Kareem uses silence to create a tension that
anyone who is uncomfortable in his presence might find unbearable.
It's a testing process that he has incorporated into his life. I find
it unfortunate but understandable that, in order to get close to
Kareem, one had to undergo this emotional frisking."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Knobler in "Giant Steps,"</TE>
<TE>   the book he co-wrote with Abdul-Jabbar</TE>
<TE>   Abdul-Jabbar never had a problem on the court. While the other two
dominant centers of the Los Angeles era, Wilt Chamberlain and
Shaquille O'Neal, depended on sheer bulk to bulldoze any hapless
defender stuck in their path, Abdul-Jabbar relied on athleticism and
finesse.</TE>
<TE>   No other player in memory had been blessed with Abdul-Jabbar's
combination of gifts, the 7-foot-2 frame of a center, the quickness
of a small forward and the shooting touch almost of a guard. Adding
to that Abdul-Jabbar's unique offensive weapon, the sky hook, made
him seem unstoppable.</TE>
<TE>   And he usually was. In high school, where, at New York's Power
Memorial, he led his team to a 95-6 record over four years, including
a 71-game winning streak. In college, where, at UCLA as Lew Alcindor,
he led the Bruins to three NCAA titles and an overall mark of 88-2.
And in the pros, where he won six NBA titles, one with the Milwaukee
Bucks and five with the Lakers, and, over a 20-year span, became the
NBA's all-time leading scorer with 38,387 points.</TE>
<TE>   Enough said?</TE>
<TE>   Abdul-Jabbar thought so.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to talk to the public," he says. "I didn't want to
talk to the media. I was not people-oriented. I really wasn't very
good at communicating. I just wanted to play and go home."</TE>
<TE>   With the media, he would often respond with terse answers or roll
his eyes at a question and flash that bone-chilling Abdul-Jabbar
stare.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not my cup of tea," he says. "I was more cerebral,
thoughtful, into other things. Public recognition was not what I was
into."</TE>
<TE>   His silence became deafening after Magic Johnson joined the Lakers
in 1979, smiling and bubbly, a media magnet.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, the media was a necessary evil, " Abdul-Jabbar says. "To
him, it was heaven on earth. He did enough interviews for two or
three teams. I would have been happy if he had done mine."</TE>
<TE>   There was resentment among his Laker teammates as well because
Abdul-Jabbar often seemed aloof. Although he didn't deny
Abdul-Jabbar's value to the team, one player carried around and
proudly displayed a book of matches that read, "Trade Kareem."</TE>
<TE>   Getting the Silent Treatment</TE>
<TE>   Although he knew he hadn't exactly won friends or influenced
people, Abdul-Jabbar didn't figure it would matter when he left the
game in 1989 at 42. He wasn't planning on coming back.</TE>
<TE>   After 33 years on a basketball court, starting in the fourth
grade, he says he was "totally burned out."</TE>
<TE>   So he plopped himself down on a beach in Hawaii for a while, spent
time with his kids--he has five ranging in age from 10 to 30--and
eventually pursued his passion for black history. After writing a
second book on his basketball career, he authored "Black Profiles in
Courage" in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   But the itch for basketball came back. It started when he was
asked by the Philadelphia 76ers to work with 7-foot-6 center Shawn
Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't have a clue," Abdul-Jabbar says. "He's a gifted
athlete, but he didn't understand defense. He didn't understand other
aspects of the game."</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, he took a baby step into coaching by becoming a volunteer
assistant for Alchesay High on the Fort Apache Indian reservation in
White River, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul-Jabbar also taught history on the reservation and wrote a
book about his experiences, "A Season on the Reservation: My Sojourn
with the White Mountain Apaches."</TE>
<TE>   Having decided he was ready for a giant step, Abdul-Jabbar put out
the word that he wanted to become at least an assistant in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Only two executives, Wes Unseld of the Washington Wizards and
Ernie Grunfeld of the New York Knicks, responded by interviewing
Abdul-Jabbar.</TE>
<TE>   How about the Lakers?</TE>
<TE>   Just before Phil Jackson was hired, owner Jerry Buss, knowing
Abdul-Jabbar's expertise on Oriental rugs, invited his former center
out to lunch to discuss a home he was redecorating.</TE>
<TE>   In between the salad and the rugs, Abdul-Jabbar managed to slip in
his new career goals.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him I was interested in a coaching job or a front-office
position," Abdul-Jabbar says, "but I never heard from him again.
People feel that they can talk to me about anything other than that.
I don't get it. But I've moved on."</TE>
<TE>   Contacted in Los Angeles, Buss said he followed up on the
conversation by recommending Abdul-Jabbar for a coaching position at
USC.</TE>
<TE>   The Hall of Fame center finally made it to the NBA midway through
the 1999-2000 season when Jim Todd replaced Chris Ford with the
Clippers. Abdul-Jabbar was brought in to work with center Michael
Olowokandi, an experience that proved to be less than satisfying for
Abdul-Jabbar</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't receptive to me," Abdul-Jabbar says. "He talked about
being receptive, but he wasn't. He tuned me out because I expected
him to work on things that he felt nobody else was working on. Some
of the players had already packed in the season and were thinking
about things like tennis."</TE>
<TE>   After the season, Todd was gone and Abdul-Jabbar was back on the
job market.</TE>
<TE>   Following the Wooden Steps</TE>
<TE>   So now that he will be standing on the sideline, which of his many
coaches will Abdul-Jabbar emulate? John Wooden, architect of the UCLA
dynasty, and Jack McKinney, architect of Showtime.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul-Jabbar loved Wooden's focus on fundamentals and McKinney's
knack for putting players in positions that best fit them.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Wooden was so far beyond us in terms of understanding the
game," Abdul-Jabbar says. "I think about him a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Don't look for Abdul-Jabbar to lose patience as Jerry West often
did as a coach.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't because they couldn't play up to his level,"
Abdul-Jabbar says. "People who don't have patience, don't have
patience. Jerry was very emotional and couldn't understand people
making all that money and not making the effort."</TE>
<TE>   And don't look for Abdul-Jabbar to take the scholarly approach of
Paul Westhead.</TE>
<TE>   "He was fine as long as he followed what Jack [McKinney] had laid
out for him," Abdul-Jabbar says. "But he kept trying to turn the
volume up."</TE>
<TE>   And don't look for Abdul-Jabbar to play the psychological games
employed by Pat Riley.</TE>
<TE>   "That wears thin, very thin, very quickly," Abdul-Jabbar says.</TE>
<TE>   Almost Mythical</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in Chicago, Johnell Sloan considered Abdul-Jabbar his
hero, spending hours trying to perfect a sky hook of his own. Now
Sloan has a chance to learn personally from the master as a member of
the Storm. And he couldn't be more excited.</TE>
<TE>   "Who wouldn't want to play for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?" Sloan says.
"He's almost a mythical type. Why would any kid in America not want
to be in this situation? He played for 20 years, he's the all-time
leading scorer, he played for John Wooden, he played for Pat Riley.
You just want to squeeze his brain, learn all you can. You want to be
around him 24/7 until he says, 'Johnell, get away from me.'"</TE>
<TE>   His players, Sloan says, want to pay him back for the experience
he has given them.</TE>
<TE>   "We all want to win the USBL title for him," Sloan says, "because
he has been snubbed by the NBA. How can a Larry Bird or an Isiah
Thomas be a coach and not him? We all want to show the NBA he
deserves to be there."</TE>
<TE>   Abdul-Jabbar says his next giant step, to a major coaching
position, doesn't necessarily have to be to the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   "A college would be great too," he says. "I do a lot of lectures
at college and I like the academic atmosphere. Anything along those
lines would work for me as well."</TE>
<TE>   There's also a possibility that, after this three-month
experiment--the 30-game Storm season concludes at the end of June--he
might decide coaching is not for him.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't look like that will happen," Abdul-Jabbar says. "I
like it. I'm drawn to it."</TE>
<TE>   He says it with a big smile. At 55, Abdul-Jabbar seems to be
finally reaching out, loosening up, silent no longer as he embraces
the basketball world he kept at his considerable arm's length for so
long.</TE>

<HD>The Seven-Game Itch</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Kings' commanding 3-1 victory sets up another
deciding game in Denver on Monday. Coaches' shouting match adds fuel
to the fire.</DH>

<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>History repeated itself.</LD>
<LD>   Lightning struck twice.</LD>
<LD>   Squaring their first-round Stanley Cup playoff series at three
victories apiece, the Kings defeated the Colorado Avalanche, 3-1, in
Game 6 on Saturday in front of 18,449 at Staples Center, forcing the
Avalanche to play a series-deciding game against them for the second
consecutive year.</LD>
<TE>   Game 7 is at Denver on Monday night, by which time coaches Andy
Murray of the Kings and Bob Hartley of the Avalanche might have
buried the hatchet.</TE>
<TE>   Into each other, probably.</TE>
<TE>   The two teams have played 13 playoff games in the last 12 months,
with the Avalanche parlaying a 5-1 victory over the Kings in Game 7
of the Western Conference semifinals last May to the Stanley Cup
championship, and perhaps they've seen enough of each other.</TE>
<TE>   After Avalanche left wing Brad Larsen mugged King defenseman
Andreas Lilja along the boards in the closing seconds Saturday,
Murray jumped onto the King bench and screamed toward the Avalanche
bench. Hartley gave it right back.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just asking about what time the ice time was for practice
on Monday in Colorado and he said, 'I think it's 11 o'clock,'" Murray
said afterward, tongue firmly in cheek. "And I said, 'No, I think
it's 11:30.'</TE>
<TE>   "We went back and forth like that a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Turning serious, Murray said, "We do things a little differently.
... I think we do things a little differently at the end of the
game."</TE>
<TE>   Pressed to elaborate, the coach said, "They've got a lot of classy
players on that team. I respect their players a great deal."</TE>
<TE>   Hartley, following Murray into the interview room, implied that
the Kings had not been fair in their treatment of Avalanche forward
Peter Forsberg, who sat out Saturday because of a leg injury. And he
was clearly perturbed that the first question put to him was about
his verbal spat with Murray.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even understand your question," he said in his clipped
French accent. "You listen to radio, you watch TV, you read the
papers, it's Andy, Andy, Andy all the time. He's the guy who gets the
most coverage in that first round when you guys should focus on
Sakic, on Blake, on Roy, on Potvin, Smolinski, Allison, Palffy. Even
his players are fully aware of this. I have no energy to waste with
this."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he were fed up, Hartley added, "My parents always taught
me not to waste time with 4-feet-6 guys. There's no sense even
wasting time."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Hartley was upset that Murray had all but guaranteed a
Game 6 victory for the Kings, writing on a grease board before Game
5, "Win Thursday and we will be playing Game 7 Monday," and his
players had delivered.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, the postgame sideshow was at least as entertaining
as the game.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, trying to become the 17th team in NHL history to rally
from a 3-1 deficit to win a best-of-seven playoff series after
falling one victory short against the Avalanche a year ago, led
almost from start to finish.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Allison scored a goal off his right leg 81 seconds into the
game, Brad Chartrand scored the first playoff goal of his career
about five minutes later and the Kings again got stellar efforts from
their defensive corps and goaltender Felix Potvin. They've given up
only three goals in winning three of the last four games.</TE>
<TE>   Potvin, who made 23 saves, gave up only a second-period goal by
Riku Hahl, ending the goaltender's shutout streak after 125 minutes 3
seconds.</TE>
<TE>   It only provided the final margin, however, because earlier in the
period Bryan Smolinski had scored to give the Kings a 3-0 advantage,
the biggest lead either team has enjoyed in a tightly contested,
physical series.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, playing without injured regulars Adam Deadmarsh and
Philippe Boucher, killed six penalties, all after they'd scored their
first two goals.</TE>
<TE>   "In our barn when we get the lead, it seems to fuel us,"
defenseman Aaron Miller said after the Kings had improved to 11-1-2
at Staples Center since March 2. "We come out real hard in this rink.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we're going to have to do it on the road. It's going to be a
hostile environment, but we're just happy to have that game. I think
we earned that Game 7, and now we've got to work that much harder to
win it."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about his coach the prognosticator, Miller said, "Did he say
we were going to win Game 7? I didn't see him out there with skates
helping us out."</TE>
<TE>   Miller grinned.</TE>
<TE>   "He wants his team to win and he'll do anything to help us win,"
he said of Murray, who actually is about 5-10, despite what Hartley
says. "If he thinks saying something in the paper will fuel us or
spark us, that's what he's going to try.</TE>
<TE>   "We play for each other in here."</TE>

<PH>NBA PLAYOFFS PORTLAND VS. LAKERS / SERIES REPORT</PH>
<KH>LAKER NOTES</KH>
<HD>West Appears Close to Deal With Grizzlies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laker lifer Jerry West has had "very positive discussions with the
Memphis Grizzlies," according to an NBA source, and is near a
decision that could make him that organization's president of
basketball operations.</LD>
<LD>   After months of considering a return to the game full time after
resigning from the Lakers nearly two summers ago, West, 63, appears
to have chosen to resume his career.</LD>
<LD>   He has negotiated recently with the Grizzlies and the Atlanta
Hawks, second-tier teams with young talent but seeking direction.</LD>
<TE>   If he accepts a multiyear offer by Grizzly owner Michael Heisley,
West would control the basketball side of the franchise. President
Dick Versace probably would become general manager, replacing the
recently fired Billy Knight.</TE>
<TE>   Since leaving the Laker front office because of health concerns,
West has served as a team consultant. As his health has improved, so
has his desire to return to a decision-making post increased.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As the Lakers stormed through their 15-1 postseason a year ago,
they became the NBA's foot-to-throat finishers, not missing a single
chance to close out a series.</TE>
<TE>   They defeated last year's four playoff foes--Portland, Sacramento,
San Antonio and Philadelphia--by an average of 15 points in those
final games. Three of the finales were on the road, in Portland,
Sacramento and Philadelphia, where aggressive crowds ultimately were
of no consequence.</TE>
<TE>   Today at Portland, the Lakers have reached their first close-out
game since. They hold a two-games-to-none lead in the best-of-five
series, and a chartered jet waits on a runway at the edge of town.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just poise," Kobe Bryant said. "Poise, being calm, us coming
in with the mind-set of this being the only game we know. That's it.
We play on Sunday. It's the only game we know."</TE>
<TE>   It is the Laker vernacular for playing the game for its own sake,
for not minding the pressure of a close-out or the comfort of a
two-game lead.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a mini-series like this," Laker Coach Phil Jackson
said, "you don't have a lot of room for error."</TE>
<TE>   Asked why the Lakers were able to conclude each series so
ruthlessly, Robert Horry said, "Basketball gods."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bryant said Saturday that he is healthy, strong and clear-headed,
which makes his worst shooting slump of the season all the more
confounding.</TE>
<TE>   But not for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been getting good looks," he said. "I just haven't made the
shots. That's going to come around."</TE>
<TE>   Trail Blazer Coach Maurice Cheeks defended Bryant with Scottie
Pippen to start Game 1, then Bonzi Wells to start Game 2. Ruben
Patterson guarded Bryant for periods in both games.</TE>
<TE>   While Bryant missed 34 of 49 field-goal attempts, he averaged 26.5
points, primarily because he made 20 of 22 free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care either way," he said of the Pippen or Wells matchup.
"It doesn't change what I do out there."</TE>

<HD>Jackson's Soul Train of Thought</HD>
<DH>Lakers: Adopting familiar look and rhetoric before Game 3,
coach shoots from lip, targeting Portland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tiny gray whiskers are beginning to push out from beneath Phil
Jackson's lower lip, and so it appears the soul patch, gone for
months, will return.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson, it seems, is beginning to feel like himself again at the
end of a season in which he never denigrated an NBA city or its
inhabitants, despite two trips to Sacramento and another to
Milwaukee, both of which provided ample opportunity.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers play the Portland Trail Blazers today at the Rose
Garden in Portland, where a victory would sweep the Trail Blazers
from the best-of-five first-round playoff series and thus supply the
Lakers and Shaquille O'Neal with adequate rest before the next round.</LD>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers' arena often is home to angry, outspoken people,
whether unhappy with the Lakers or with their own team, a churlish,
financially bloated bunch that feels put upon by referees and NBA
lords and men in soul patches.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson on Saturday afternoon considered the edgy environment.
Dangerous and ill-tempered as the place is, the Lakers completed last
year's first-round sweep in the very same building.</TE>
<TE>   Before that game, Portland's Scottie Pippen appeared on the
television that hung from the ceiling of the Laker locker room,
explaining how the Trail Blazers expected to win that game.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant stood, shook his head and walked straight through the
room.</TE>
<TE>   "You're ... crazy, man," Bryant said to the monitor. "Today's your
last day of work."</TE>
<TE>   And so it was, and now the Lakers find themselves in the very same
spot, having won Games 1 and 2 with relative ease, hoping to win the
third in a gym stuffed with antagonistic Northwesterners.</TE>
<TE>   Already on Saturday, Jackson had compared the game to the Last
Supper and the media to Judas. Appropriately, he wore sandals, the
kind Jesus would wear if He had had a shoe contract and had won 10
NBA titles. The Portland folks, who hold up nasty signs and chuck
tiny Bill Walton dummies and heave loud, aggressive insults, puzzle
Jackson, truth be told.</TE>
<TE>   He grinned and rocked back on his heels.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm actually surprised Portland people can actually root for
their players, given the type of character they display on the
court," Jackson said. "They somehow manage to. Maybe they owe their
allegiance because they carry the name of the town on their backs, I
don't know.</TE>
<TE>   "Other than that," he continued, "I don't think the pressure
should bother us. I mean, it is the only game in town in Portland.
But there are other things. The [minor-league] Beavers play in the
rain sometimes. It's nice in the summertime for a month or so. So, it
does allow them to have outdoor activities."</TE>
<TE>   It went on like that for a while.</TE>
<TE>   "I love Oregon," he said eventually. "I think it's a nice place to
vacation. I hope [the Trail Blazers] go on vacation after tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   His eyes showed amusement at that. The Trail Blazers had their
usual Game 2 moments Thursday, when they imploded while getting
beaten anyway. Dale Davis was ejected after receiving two technicals
inside half a minute, and Bonzi Wells and Pippen fouled out, Wells by
the end seemingly committing fouls for the sport of it. Ruben
Patterson drew a flagrant foul for winding up and hacking O'Neal
across the forearms.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Trail Blazers also went Sponge Bob-Square Pants in
Game 2, when Arvydas Sabonis flopped cartoonishly away from O'Neal
and inadvertently struck teammate Rasheed Wallace in the face. Angry
because Sabonis could not defend O'Neal or because it caused him to
bleed from the mouth, Wallace threw a towel in Sabonis' face.</TE>
<TE>   That day, the Trail Blazers were called for five technical fouls
and had two players ejected. Davis, their center, has been ejected
from consecutive Games 2, last year for trying to elbow Robert Horry
in the throat, an attack that also had him suspended for Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   While implosion was followed by elimination then, Jackson said he
does not necessarily suspect the same simple transition this time.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it spilled over into their final game," he said. "I don't
expect that this year. I expect them to give us a run for it all the
way through the game."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers practiced early Saturday, then flew to Portland. They
arranged last week, before the results of the series' first two
games, to return to Los Angeles tonight. If there is a Game 4 on
Wednesday, they'll travel on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   After playing well for most of Thursday's seven-point victory,
leading in the fourth quarter by 21 before ignoring the final five
minutes, the Lakers were eager to play again. Dating to Game 6 of the
2000 NBA Finals, the Lakers have won five consecutive close-out
games.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels like waiting for the Last Supper," Jackson said. "You
know, it's either exoneration or execution."</TE>

<LD>Scott Riggs had the car to beat. Greg Biffle had the car to beat him.
But with Riggs making up spots during pit stops, and Biffle falling
backward, it was Riggs who won the NASCAR Busch Series Auto Club 300
on Saturday at California Speedway.</LD>
<LD>   "[Biffle's] was the only car as good as ours, if not better," said
Riggs, who passed 41 of 42 cars during the race and couldn't believe
his good fortune when Biffle pitted under a yellow flag with 17 laps
remaining. "I don't know what they were thinking."</LD>
<LD>   Riggs finished 0.991 seconds ahead of Jeff Green and earned
$84,670 for his victory in front of about 50,000 at the two-mile
oval. The race was red-flagged with nine laps remaining because of
the seventh caution flag. On the restart with six laps remaining,
Riggs spun the tires, and Green nosed ahead on the front stretch but
didn't finish the pass. Riggs held off Green and then stretched his
lead by about two-tenths of a second per lap.</LD>
<TE>   Stacy Compton finished third, pole-sitter Jack Sprague fourth and
Jason Keller fifth. The victory was the second this season for Riggs,
a rookie who led 49 laps and moved from fifth to third in the series.
It is his third top-four finish in the last four races.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just hoping for a top five or a top 10 finish, that would
be an accomplishment," said Riggs, who started 42nd out of 43 cars
because he replaced his Robert Yates engine Saturday morning.</TE>
<TE>   The car to watch during most of the race was Biffle's. He started
seventh, took the lead on Lap 17 and led a race-high 67 laps. He
consistently pulled away from the field, opening a lead of 6.4
seconds by the time a yellow flag came out on Lap 44.</TE>
<TE>   He led from laps 56-82 and 88-96. He gave up the lead when he
pitted under yellow on Lap 97 and came out in 12th place. Riggs
retained second place, passed series points leader Sprague on Lap 102
and never gave it up.</TE>
<TE>   Biffle was in second place by Lap 122, then came his untimely pit
stop. He came out in 14th place and finished 10th.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winston West driver Eric Norris of Dana Point won the Pontiac
Widetrack Grand Prix 200 at California Speedway. Norris, the son of
actor Chuck Norris and a part-time Hollywood stunt coordinator,
retook the lead from Kevin Richards with 22 laps remaining on the
two-mile oval, then held off Richards and series points leader Austin
Cameron after a caution flag forced a restart with two laps left.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing in the world we wanted at the end was a restart,"
Norris said. "[Richards and Cameron] are great at restarts."</TE>
<TE>   The race was scheduled for 200 miles, but was shortened by 18
because of time restraints.</TE>
<TE>   Richards passed Norris after an earlier restart on Lap 67, but
gave back the lead two laps later. Norris led by 1.6 seconds with
seven laps remaining, but a blown engine by Jack Sellers spilled oil
on the track, forcing the final restart.</TE>
<TE>   Norris, 36, whose chance for victory at this race last season
evaporated when he had to make a green-flag pit stop for fuel late in
the race, averaged 135.708 mph in his Ford Taurus and earned $24,501
for the victory.</TE>

<LD>   Junqueira, who had the fastest time in practice and started from
the pole, used outstanding pit strategy Saturday at Motegi, Japan, to
claim his second career CART FedEx championship series win.</LD>
<LD>   "The car was good from when we started running Thursday,"
Junqueira said. "I knew that Tony [Kanaan] and Paul [Tracy] led
early, but I also knew it would be a long race and I just tried to be
patient."</LD>
<TE>   Junqueira, driving a Toyota-powered Lola, took the lead for good
four laps from the finish of the 201-lap race at the 1.5-mile Motegi
oval, north of Tokyo, and crossed the finish line with a total time
of 2 hours, 5.882 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Canada's Alex Tagliani held a brief lead after 162 laps but went
in for a pit stop on the 169th lap and had to settle for second,
12.282 seconds back in his Ford-Cosworth Reynard. Scotland's Dario
Franchitti was third in a Honda-Reynard.</TE>
<TE>   Junqueira made his final pit stop on the 190th lap. Franchitti
took a brief lead, but lost it when he made his final pit stop on the
197th lap.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was the first for Toyota at the Honda-built oval,
which opened in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   American Michael Andretti, who won the Toyota Grand Prix of Long
Beach two weeks ago, was forced to pull out after 115 laps due to
mechanical problems.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Schumacher claimed his third pole of the season and was
joined on the front row by Ferrari teammate Rubens Barrichello in
qualifying for the Spanish Grand Prix at Barcelona, Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher's final qualifying lap of 1 minute 16.364 seconds was
fractions of a second faster than Barrichello's 1:16.690.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher averaged 138.585 mph en route to the 46th pole of his
career.</TE>

<HD>Stock Car Racing Never Grows Old for Marlin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ryan Newman, Kurt Busch, Jimmie Johnson, Kevin Harvick, Dale
Earnhardt Jr.... The names of NASCAR's young lions trip lightly off
the tongues of stock car racing fans, and the precocious drivers
themselves acknowledge that they are having the times of their young
lives.</LD>
<LD>   But when the hot young Winston Cup stars take the green flag in
their fast Fords and Chevrolets at noon today for the start of the
NAPA Auto Parts 500 at California Speedway, they might want to check
their mirrors often, just to make sure they aren't being reeled in by
an old-timey Dodge driver who's actually having more fun than they
are.</LD>
<LD>   For them, it's the first sweet smell of success. For Sterling
Marlin, it's the second time around, and if his success is nothing
new, that makes it no less welcome.</LD>
<TE>   "We're having a big time," said Marlin, 44, who drove his first
Winston Cup race a year and a half before Newman was born. "I'm
having the most fun I've ever had. It's fun to show up and know
you've got a great race car."</TE>
<TE>   It's axiomatic that a good car gets better with the right driver
and, from all appearances, Marlin is precisely the driver Dodge was
looking for when it returned to big-time racing last year.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't exactly the plan. Ray Evernham's team was going to be
Dodge's standard bearer. But it was Marlin, driving for Chip
Ganassi/Felix Sabates, who won two races, accounting for half of
Dodge's victories, who finished third in the season standings, behind
four-time Chevy champion Jeff Gordon and feisty Pontiac driver Tony
Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   This season? Even better. Marlin has already won twice, at Las
Vegas and Darlington, and leads the standings by 109 points over Ford
driver Matt Kenseth.</TE>
<TE>   "This past year and a half's been really good for me," said
Marlin, a long-time Chevy driver. "When we signed up with Dodge, that
kinda opened doors that weren't open to us before. I don't want to
step on anyone's toes, but Chevrolet's gonna take care of the
Hendrick and Earnhardt and Childress teams. We were kinda low on the
totem pole. With Dodge, we came in and were the equal to anybody."</TE>
<TE>   In his first go-round as a stock car star, Marlin won successive
Daytona 500s, in 1994, when he went on to the Winston Cup
championship, then again in '95, the same year he scored the first of
his two victories at Talladega, NASCAR's other high-banked
superspeedway.</TE>
<TE>   This time around, Marlin has been hot on the smaller tracks. He
won last season at Michigan International, the two-mile track after
which California Speedway was patterned, and on the 1.5-mile high
banks of Lowe's Motor Speedway near Charlotte, N.C. The track at Las
Vegas is 1.5 miles, at Darlington 1.3.</TE>
<TE>   "Just shows that this team has a package for everywhere," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The car Marlin will drive today is new to competition but not new
to the two-mile D-shaped track. Marlin tested it for two days here in
March--well, a day and a half, as it turned out--and got a good feel
for the track.</TE>
<TE>   "For a day and a half, we ran our race setup and then we was gonna
run our qualifying setup after lunch the second day but that got
rained out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So, when people ask why he didn't qualify well here Friday--he was
25th at 184.280 mph, more than 3 mph slower than Newman's
pole-winning speed of 187.432--that might be part of the reason. A
bigger part, though, might have been that he qualified late in the
session, and under a bit of a handicap.</TE>
<TE>   "It started raining on us," he said. "[The car] bottomed out real
bad. You don't want to sail off down in a corner when it's raining.
We'll be all right for the race. The car was a lot faster than we
qualified."</TE>
<TE>   Marlin was 12th fastest in Saturday's happy hour, the final
practice, but in an early-morning session had been third fastest in
his new car with its new color scheme. Folks used to looking for his
familiar No. 40 "Silver Bullet" can watch for the same number, but
the car--for this race and nine others this season--has been recast
in gold, according to his sponsoring brewery's wishes.</TE>
<TE>   Which more or less goes along with the revival of Marlin's career.
If the first time around was silver, the second has been gold. The
young lions might want to keep a close eye on him.</TE>
<TE>   They also might want to cast a wary eye Gordon's way. The
defending series champion won six races last season but has won none
in 2002. He hasn't won since last September, a span of 17 races, the
longest drought in his career since his initial victory at Charlotte
in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon is going through a widely publicized divorce but says that
has not affected his driving.</TE>
<TE>   "When something like this happens, we try not to dwell on the
what-ifs," he said. "What we've learned from these races is that we
are just as competitive as we were a year ago. It's just a matter of
putting it all together."</TE>
<TE>   And this may be where it all comes together. Gordon has won two of
the five Winston Cup races here and likes the track.</TE>
<TE>   "Given our past success [here], I think we can really make a move
up the point standings," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So, what with the young speedsters, a rejuvenated Sterling Marlin,
a determined Jeff Gordon and the promise of a cool, overcast
day--precisely what race car engines like best--the more than 100,000
fans expected ought to have plenty to hold their attention.</TE>

<HD>Hornets' Davis Stings Magic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baron Davis was deprived of winning the game in regulation--so he did
the job in overtime instead.</LD>
<LD>   Official Bernie Fryer waved off Davis' three-point basket at the
fourth-quarter buzzer, but he scored nine of his 33 points after
that, and the Charlotte Hornets defeated the Orlando Magic, 110-100,
at Orlando, Fla., for a 2-1 lead in their first-round playoff series
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought I got it off in time, but the ref didn't think so,"
said Davis, the former UCLA Bruin who also had 14 rebounds and 10
assists. "So we had to go to overtime."</LD>
<TE>   The Hornets can advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals with
a victory in Game 4 Tuesday night in Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   With 0.7 seconds remaining in regulation, Davis caught P.J.
Brown's inbounds pass at the top of the circle, turned and banked a
shot in the basket to apparently win the game. Television replays
clearly showed that Davis got the shot off before time expired.</TE>
<TE>   But almost as soon as Davis released the ball, Fryer began waving
his arms and shouting that the shot was no good.</TE>
<TE>   Fryer said that during the timeout preceding the shot, the
officiating crew discussed what a player would be allowed to do--and
that a catch-turn-release sequence wasn't going to count.</TE>
<TE>   "He had to cock to get a three-pointer up to get muscle behind
it," Fryer said. "And I said you can't do that in seven-tenths."</TE>
<TE>   That reasoning worked for Orlando Coach Doc Rivers, who
acknowledged thinking the game was over when Davis' shot found the
basket.</TE>
<TE>   "When you think about it, it is impossible to catch, turn, jump
and shoot in .7 seconds, and that's basically what Bernie Fryer said
right away," Rivers said.</TE>
<TE>   The clock, Fryer added, is merely used to supplement an official's
call in that situation.</TE>
<TE>   "You can rely on the clock, but I'm going to rely on my judgment
on how long it takes him to get the shot off," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In overtime, Davis made two three-point baskets and three free
throws as Charlotte outscored Orlando, 18-8.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando's Tracy McGrady scored 37 points.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte was without Jamal Mashburn, its leading scorer during
the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Mashburn is still recovering from mild anemia and vitamin
deficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 94, Detroit 84--Antonio Davis made 14 of 19 shots from the
field and scored 30 points as the Toronto Raptors avoided elimination
at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Keon Clark added 18 points on seven of 11 shooting, Alvin Williams
scored 17, Chris Childs had 12 points and 10 assists in his second
consecutive start and Morris Peterson led the defensive effort on the
Pistons' Jerry Stackhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Stackhouse, who had 31 points in the Pistons' Game 2 victory,
missed his first seven shots, was scoreless in the first half and
finished with 11 points on two of 10 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Chucky Atkins led the Pistons with 21 points.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 102, Seattle 75--Tim Duncan had 27 points and 13
rebounds and Tony Parker added 23 points as the Spurs took a 2-1 lead
in their series at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Game 4 will be played in Seattle Wednesday night. If a Game 5 is
necessary, it will be played Friday night in San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs won without starting center David Robinson, who was
resting his injured back and missed his second game in a row.</TE>

<HD>Mets Again Flirt With a No-Hitter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shawn Estes looked at the scoreboard in the fourth inning and thought
to himself that maybe this would be the day the New York Mets broke
their 41-year no-hit jinx.</LD>
<LD>   Vance Wilson vowed not to rehearse his no-hit speech too early
this time. Jeromy Burnitz felt fortunate to watch another dominating
pitching performance.</LD>
<LD>   For the second consecutive game, the New York Mets flirted with a
no-hitter and fell short. Pedro Astacio didn't give up a hit until
Geoff Jenkins lined a single to left field with one out in the
seventh inning Saturday at New York, and the Mets beat the Milwaukee
Brewers, 2-1.</LD>
<TE>   "It can happen," Astacio said. "We have to keep pitching well and
we'll keep winning ballgames. I don't think anybody is worried about
a no-hitter. We're just trying to win."</TE>
<TE>   Less than 24 hours after Estes retired the first 18 Brewers and
pitched the 19th complete-game one-hitter for the Mets, Astacio
nearly topped him.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought maybe this could be the day," Estes said. "I told
[pitching coach] Charlie Hough before the game that it's going to
happen this year. We've got guys who are capable of doing it."</TE>
<TE>   But no one ever has with the Mets. Not Tom Seaver, Nolan Ryan,
Dwight Gooden or David Cone -- among the many great Mets pitchers who
didn't pitch a no-hitter until after leaving the team.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets, who have played 6,374 games, are among only five major
league teams that have never thrown a no-hitter, joined by four
younger teams: San Diego, Colorado, Arizona and Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the staff to do it," said Wilson, who acknowledged
practicing his post-game speech in the fifth inning Friday. "Any of
the five guys can do it. If we keep at it, we probably will."</TE>
<TE>   Astacio (4-1) gave up one run and three hits in eight innings. He
walked one and struck out two. Armando Benitez pitched the ninth for
his seventh save.</TE>
<TE>   With chants of "Pedro! Pedro!" ringing throughout Shea Stadium at
the start of the seventh inning, Astacio retired Mark Loretta on a
lineout to right field.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins then lined a clean single to left. Astacio walked behind
the mound as the crowd of 35,105 gave a standing ovation. The Brewers
were one of 46 in the series before the hit.</TE>
<TE>   After Jenkins' single, Astacio walked Matt Stairs, but then the
right-hander induced a double-play grounder by Tyler Houston to get
out of the inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets took a 1-0 lead in the first inning when Roberto Alomar
led off with a double and scored on a two-out single by Burnitz
against Nick Neugebauer (1-3).</TE>
<TE>   Wilson had a run-scoring double in the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 8, San Francisco 4--Jose Rijo made his first Cinergy
Field start in seven years and put on another nostalgic show,
pitching six innings in a steady rain to help the Reds win at
Cincinnati in a game called in the middle of the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   The Reds' seventh consecutive victory kept them in first place in
the NL Central, a major surprise that pales alongside Rijo's
renaissance.</TE>
<TE>   Rijo, who turns 37 next month, has come full circle in his
comeback from five elbow operations. The right-hander made his second
start in a week and got his second victory, giving 22,616 fans a few
glimpses of the Rijo of old.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up five hits and two runs in six innings, his longest
Cinergy Field appearance since May 22, 1995. Corky Miller and Adam
Dunn each hit two-run homers against Ryan Jensen (1-2) and the Reds
pulled ahead, 8-0, before Rijo gave up a hit. Miller later doubled
home two more runs, matching his career high of four runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 8, Philadelphia 6--Todd Helton hit a bases-loaded triple
at Denver and the Rockies improved to 2-0 under new Manager Clint
Hurdle. Colorado had lost five in a row and was 6-16 before Buddy
Bell was fired as manager Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Chacon (2-3) gave up two earned runs, five hits and five
walks in 51/3 innings. He also drove in a run. Jose Jimenez pitched
the ninth for his sixth save in six chances. He struck out Travis Lee
with the bases loaded to end it.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Walker put the Rockies ahead, 3-1, with a two-run homer in
the third.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 5, Montreal 0--Reliever Mike Matthews combined with
three St. Louis pitchers on a five-hitter at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Eduardo Perez hit a solo homer in the fourth inning against Bruce
Chen (2-1). Placido Polanco's run-scoring double keyed a four-run
fifth. Chen, making his first start this season, left after giving up
three consecutive hits to begin the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 6, Atlanta 3--Gregg Zaun drove in four runs with a double
and a triple to lead the Astros at Atlanta. Zaun, who was two for 27
against the Braves before Saturday, ended a 2-2 tie in the fifth with
a three-run double against Kevin Millwood (2-3) and had a run-scoring
triple in the ninth against Darren Holmes.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 6, Arizona 3--Playing in right field for the first time
since 1997, Cliff Floyd had three hits, two RBIs and scored twice
from first base on a double to lead the Marlins at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego at Pittsburgh--The game was postponed because of rain
and rescheduled as part of a doubleheader today.</TE>

Rijo Grand
Cincinnati
right-hander Jose
Rijo continued his
amazing comeback
Saturday, making
his first start at
Cinergy Field since
1995 and pitching
six strong innings
in the Reds' 8-4

Francisco. Rijo,
who turns 37 on May
13, didn't pitch in
the major leagues
for five seasons
because of arm
trouble, undergoing
elbow surgery five
times. A look at

RIVALRY RENEWED
The Giants' Barry Bonds had a
double in two at-bats Saturday
against Rijo but has struggled
against him in his career. In
the 1990 National League
championship series, Bonds,
then with Pittsburgh, was held
hitless in six at-bats by
Rijo--in his third season with
the Reds--and finished the
series batting .167 with one
RBI. The Reds went on to win
the World Series, with Rijo

<HD>Boston's Lowe Hits a High</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Former reliever pitches first no-hitter at Fenway
Park since 1965 in 10-0 victory over Tampa Bay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HEUSCHKEL</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Derek Lowe looked at his three starts in September last season as a
beginning and nothing more. He knew there would be more work.</LD>
<LD>   The physical part of the transformation from reliever to starter
began over the winter as Lowe began a weightlifting program designed
to build stamina.</LD>
<LD>   The mental part was completed Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Lowe became the first to pitch a no-hitter at Fenway Park since
1965 in a 10-0 victory over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The offensive
support his teammates provided had little to do with the way Lowe
made it look relatively easy.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe threw 98 pitches and faced one batter over the minimum. He
struck out six, walked one and got 13 groundball outs. Only five
balls left the infield.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most difficult part for Lowe was sitting in the dugout
in the eighth inning when the Red Sox sent eight men to the plate.
All he could do was watch, wait and think about getting three more
outs.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard," Lowe said. "Obviously, in a perfect world, you go
1-2-3 and run back out there. But the hitters don't care what's going
on. They want to go out there and get RBIs, get hits."</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays didn't come close to getting either. The Red Sox
didn't make any spectacular defensive plays and there weren't any
close calls on the bases.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this crowd carried him his last two innings," Boston
catcher Jason Varitek said. "He wasn't out of juice, but he had a
very long wait in the eighth inning. I think if anything, that
adrenaline rush kicked in and he was loose after two pitches. This
crowd can do that to us."</TE>
<TE>   Lowe was greeted with a loud ovation from 32,837 as he emerged
from the dugout in the ninth, a stark contrast from the boos he heard
last season when he trotted in from the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives you a feeling you don't want to have again," said Lowe,
who was an All-Star closer in 2000 before losing the job last season.
"I've had drastic years, from 2000 to 2001. You don't want that
feeling where you get in a game and people are saying, 'Oh no, not
this guy.' Especially in this town."</TE>
<TE>   Lowe struck out the side in the sixth on 13 pitches. He needed
fewer than 10 to retire the side in four other innings. It took eight
in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe got Russ Johnson to hit a soft liner to second baseman Rey
Sanchez for the first out. Sanchez initially took a step back,
thinking the ball might go over his head.</TE>
<TE>   "That one didn't scare me," Varitek said. "The next one scared me
a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Felix Escalona lofted a fly ball to shallow left center that
forced Rickey Henderson to make a running basket catch.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough," said Lowe, who had developed a blister. "I'm such a
huge golf guy. I was thinking of Tiger Woods at the Masters, where he
says, 'Finish the deal.' That's exactly what I kept telling myself."</TE>
<TE>   Lowe threw a 2-and-2 changeup to Jason Tyner, who hit a grounder
to the right side. Sanchez fielded it cleanly and threw to Jose
Offerman at first. Lowe then made like Tiger, pumping his fist
skyward as players came charging out of the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost surreal," Lowe said. "You don't even think it's you.
I still don't think what I did I did, as crazy as that sounds. You
still think it's happened to somebody else."</TE>
<TE>   It nearly happened to Lowe in his first start at Baltimore. He
took a no-hitter into the eighth and lost it on an infield hit by
Tony Batista.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe came closer to one in the minors with Tacoma, Seattle's
triple-A affiliate. His bid ended when Edmonton's Jason McDonald led
off the ninth with a single.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe (4-1, 2.04 earned-run average) is the second Red Sox pitcher
to pitch a no-hitter in as many years. Hideo Nomo pitched one last
April in Baltimore, the first by a Red Sox pitcher since Dave
Morehead's at Fenway in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got a ground-ball pitcher in Derek, so anytime a ball
could just go right through the infield," said Varitek, who said Lowe
shook him off only once. "You have to have a lot of favorable things
happen to you for a sinkerball, groundball guy like Derek to have
one."</TE>
<TE>   Said Red Sox pitching coach Tony Cloninger: "About the third or
fourth inning he came up to the clubhouse and he was kind of
dissatisfied with his mechanics. I just followed him up here and he
was by the mirror working on mechanics a little bit. I said, 'Hey,
don't worry about things. Just keep pitching the way you are. You're
pitching a good game.' I didn't say anything about pitching a
no-hitter."</TE>
<TE>   Said Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez, who has yet to pitch a no-hitter:
"I think he's got a chance to throw many more. He's that kind of a
pitcher. You haven't seen anything yet."</TE>

thrown out stealing and
Shore retired the next 26
batters. However, the game
is not recognized as a
no-hitter by Major League
Baseball</TE>

<HD>Is First Round Finished Yet?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Near as I can remember before play was suspended again to set up
NBC's weekend schedule, everything had changed from the end of the
season, which was only 10 days ago, even if it seems longer.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, it could have been worse. The Lakers had a three-day
layoff, but the San Antonio Spurs went four, or as Coach Gregg
Popovich put it, "Game 3 is a month and a half from now."</LD>
<LD>   Speaking for everyone, Popovich also noted it was "a pain in the
butt."</LD>
<TE>   The waiting may not be the hardest part, either. Shaquille O'Neal
has been looking forward to the playoffs when there are fewer games,
but right now, there are a lot fewer--two a week--giving him beaucoup
time to rest his sore toe.</TE>
<TE>   Voila! There's a new, energized Shaq, representing good news in
Lakerdom and the end of the world throughout the rest of the league.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson is, indeed, upset he has to do 30 minutes of
interviews every day, but he can handle it. The shoots for his T.D.
Waterhouse commercials were way longer than 30 minutes and he never
complained about them.</TE>
<TE>   Even Commissioner David Stern, in his annual
Rebecca-of-Sunnybrook-Farm-At-The-Playoffs Tour, concedes with this
format, "You lose a little momentum."</TE>
<TE>   What Stern can't say is, "This is NBC's last gasp at making back
part of its $1.6 billion. Next year the peacock's history and we'll
go seven games in the first round. Oh, and by the way, ratings are up
5%. For a big enough ratings bump, I'd play one game a week and go
through August."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, to reflect all the changes, how about a postseason
rankings update:</TE>
<TE>   Lakers (2-0) Lakers say they have dibs on Trail Blazers in bid to
play them in first round every year.</TE>
<TE>   2. Sacramento (2-1) Oops: Team that averaged 112 in April was just
overjoyed to get 90 in Delta Center. 3. San Antonio (2-1) Big win,
but they'd better get Admiral back on deck for the next round. 4.
Dallas (2-0) With all that firepower, darkhorse Mavericks look as
scary as anyone right now. This is how it happened.</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Kings vs. No. 8 Jazz: Unfortunately--for the Kings--they had
not only swept the Jazz, 4-0, they'd done it by an average of 22
points.</TE>
<TE>   They sauntered in, almost losing Game 1, when a John Stockton
three-point shot went halfway down but spun back out, losing Game 2
decisively, on the court where they'd gone 36-5.</TE>
<TE>   Vlade Divac wrote the Jazz off after Game 1 ("That was their best
shot and now they're done") but Utah players barely noticed. They
play hard all the time and don't have to scout around for reasons to
be motivated.</TE>
<TE>   "If that stuff excites you," Coach Jerry Sloan said. "it's a
pretty weak commentary on what the game is all about."</TE>
<TE>   In the test of their young lives, the Kings won Game 3 in the
Delta Center, so at least, they know they'll see Arco Arena again.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Spurs vs. No. 7 SuperSonics: This looked like the one-sided
series everyone predicted ... for eight minutes, which is how long
David Robinson played in Game 1 before his back, which he had rested
for a week, went out again.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs blitzed the SuperSonics in Game 1 and took a 14-point
lead in the first quarter of Game 2. But then the SuperSonics noticed
that without Robinson the Spurs are so ordinary up front even Vin
Baker could break out and won Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   With team officials insisting Robinson wasn't going to play in
Games 3 or 4, the Spurs turned it around Saturday in Seattle, so at
least they'll know they'll see the Alamodome again, and, hopefully,
Robinson too.</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Lakers vs. No. 6 Trail Blazers: The Trail Blazers are
smaller, still out of control and always distracted by one problem or
another. Who could ask for anything more in an opponent?</TE>
<TE>   However, their Game 2 comeback suggests there's some fight left in
this asylum. They might not roll over in Game 3 in the Rose Garden
the way they did last season.</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Mavericks vs. No. 5 Timberwolves: Oops again.</TE>
<TE>   The deal for Raef LaFrentz and Nick Van Exel that everyone (hello)
sneered at has taken the Mavericks from explosive to super-explosive.
The Mavericks, who led the league in scoring, with the fewest
turnovers, had a remarkable 122 and six in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't pass the ball," said Van Exel, explaining their secret.
"Whoever gets the ball shoots it."</TE>
<TE>   It's still hard for little, outside-shooting teams to beat big
pound-it-in ones, but the Mavericks can do one thing no one else
can--make the Lakers play their way.</TE>
<TE>   And in the junior circuit:</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Nets vs. No. 8 Pacers: Big woofing series. Byron Scott said
he thought the Nets would win. The Pacers posted the quote on every
player's stall, as if this was the dreaded disrespect. Jermaine
O'Neal said the Nets were dissing him and none of them could play him
one-on-one.</TE>
<TE>   Net center Todd MacCulloch was asked if he could play O'Neal
straight up.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaquille O'Neal?" MacCulloch asked.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets lead, 2-1, with Jason Kidd, an MVP candidate this season
while averaging 15 points and shooting 39%, bumping it up to 24 and
47%. At that pace, he wouldn't have merely been a candidate, he'd
have been unanimous.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, yeah, Jermaine, guarded one-on-one by Kenyon Martin in the
Nets' pivotal Game 3 win, scored 12 and missed the free throw that
would have tied it with :03 left.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Pistons vs. No. 7 Raptors: Two years ago, Raptor Coach Butch
Carter said he'd sue Marcus Camby for comments in the media before
the Knicks swept them. Last season, Vince Carter flew to his
graduation the morning of Game 7, which the Raptors lost at
Philadelphia. Now Canada is aflame because Detroit fans booed "O,
Canada!"</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Raptors are down, 2-1, suggesting that while Carter
has things to learn, they still need him.</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Celtics vs. No. 6 76ers: In an upset, Coach Larry Brown and
Allen Iverson went the entire regular season without incident ... but
the regular season is over.</TE>
<TE>   While Iverson, returning after a month off with a broken left
wrist, was shooting the customary 15 of 45 in the first two games,
Brown noted:</TE>
<TE>   "You know, it's fun from my perspective to watch [the Celtics] try
to share the ball, accept their roles....</TE>
<TE>   "It's not always your star players. I think their star players are
thinking about winning the game and not dominating the game. There's
a lot of people that are part of that."</TE>
<TE>   Iverson didn't practice before Game 2 because of flu, or a
hangover, depending on whom you believe, so Brown zinged him for
being out of shape too. ("The sad thing was we all got excited when
he started off so good, but when you don't practice and you don't do
the cardio stuff and you're not with your team, you're not going to
come out and play at the level you're accustomed to playing.")</TE>
<TE>   As usual, the 76ers are going out grudgingly, but going out they
are.</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Hornets vs. No. 5 Magic: Can someone go wake up the sleeping
giant of the East again?</TE>
<TE>   The Hornets drew crowds of 9,505 and 10,323 in Games 1 and 2
(thankfully for the league, Turner ran tight shots of the crowd,
avoiding the 13,000 empty seats) and the Magic got out of town with a
split.</TE>
<TE>   Then Baron Davis, whose back tightened up in Game 2, went for 33
points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists in Game 3 as the Hornets won in
overtime and went up, 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando's Tracy McGrady has back troubles too, although he's still
averaging 29-7-6. In response to the community-wide alarm, a local
veterinarian contacted the team, recommending his new laser
technique.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he had used it mainly on horses to date.</TE>
<TE>   "He said it hasn't been FDA-approved yet, but he tried it on his
kids and it worked," said Magic trainer Teddy Arzonico. "I appreciate
the tip, but I don't think we're going that route."</TE>

<LD>If we're really going to go back indoors to watch more of that, if
we're to summon the guts, dig up the resolve, practice the dubious
judgment to witness Game 3, we'll need a slogan, a vision, a purpose,
to carry us through to blessed nightfall.</LD>
<LD>   In a world where "Beat L.A." seems farfetched, "Beat Contempt"
might work. If the Trail Blazers can prove they're better than sheer
contempt for once, if they can treat the game and their coach with
some respect, win or lose, they can almost render worthwhile these
six months and 85 games, even if it ends identically to last year's
six months and 85 games.</LD>
<LD>   Other slogans don't quite cut it.</LD>
<TE>   "Drive For Game 5" fails because it would waste jet fuel and
man-hours for another inevitable Staples Center loss. "Ignore The
Officials" directed toward the Blazers sounds like "Quit Smoking,"
directed toward an addicted uncle.</TE>
<TE>   "Just Melt Down" seems too obvious. "Remember the Regular Season"
would work, except no one with a right mind can.</TE>
<TE>   But "Beat Contempt"? That has a chance. The Blazers could play
like they love playing for a living, engage the Lakers in something
compelling, appear to appreciate their first-year coach, seem
grown-up enough to value a good try above freaking out.</TE>
<TE>   It might seem like bread crumbs, but then, Portland's starving.</TE>
<TE>   Last April, a team too feeble to defeat contempt lived in it,
bathed in it, suffered in it. The result of all this defeatism was
defeat, three games to none.</TE>
<TE>   This time around, the team did veer toward contempt Thursday night
in Game 2, but landed only on exaggerated frustration. Thursday's
hideousness, while hideous, came off less egregiously hideous than
the hyper-hideous hideousness of the prior Game 2. It's still safe to
hope for three games to none with a little victory over contempt, as
an improvement over three games to none, period.</TE>
<TE>   If the Blazers can't quite respect themselves enough to avoid
self-sabotage, the least they can do is not sabotage their coach.</TE>
<TE>   Maurice Cheeks has endured just about everything in life many NBA
players have endured--issues from sociological to hoopological--and
has never been anything but a respectable NBA lifer.</TE>
<TE>   Eight minutes to go in Game 2, the coach who had tried a press,
careful timeouts and just about everything in the bag, stood watching
action squarely in front of him.</TE>
<TE>   Rasheed Wallace, working the left post, turned around to shoot,
and Robert Horry rose to swat the ball to Encino.</TE>
<TE>   The hideous third quarter already in the books, the last straws
thinning, Cheeks' face dropped, and he began a careful study of the

<LD>Long after the Kings lived to skate another day, the meaning of that
day came into stark and startling focus.</LD>
<LD>   The prospects for Game 7 against the Colorado Avalanche weren't
found on the crowded Staples Center ice but in a near-empty adjoining
hallway.</LD>
<LD>   The center of the Kings' hopes wasn't surrounded by cheers, but
the quiet and slow clacking of shoes on the concrete.</LD>
<TE>   His name is Jason Allison.</TE>
<TE>   When he left work Saturday, he was badly limping.</TE>
<TE>   Long after leading the Kings to a 3-1 victory in Game 6, Allison's
pained departure added even more tension to a series that is already
thick and sweaty with it.</TE>
<TE>   We have Andy Murray gesturing and screaming at Colorado Coach Bob
Hartley in the final minute for sending out his thugs.</TE>
<TE>   Said Murray: "I just said, 'C'mon Bob, you've got to have class.'"</TE>
<TE>   Said Hartley: "My parents always told me not to waste your time on
4-foot-6 guys."</TE>
<TE>   Said Murray: "I'm just over 5-10."</TE>
<TE>   We also have Colorado's Brad Larsen flattening Andreas Lilja with
five seconds left in the game, then Colorado's Darius Kasparaitis
tangling with Kelly Buchberger with two seconds left, all this bad
blood trickling toward Monday night's game at Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "Monday is gonna be huge," said the Kings' Mikko Eloranta. "I
can't wait for that day."</TE>
<TE>   We have the Kings trying to join the 8% of NHL teams that have
rebounded from a 3-1 deficit to win a playoff series, while the
confused defending champs face Stanley Cup-sized humiliation.</TE>
<TE>   "They have all the pressure on them," said the Kings' Eric
Belanger.</TE>
<TE>   But more than anything, we have Allison trying to hold it all
together.</TE>
<TE>   His injured leg. His injury-filled team. That rascal of a coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to get into it, I'll be fine," Allison said of what
appeared to be a hip or leg injury. "Lots of guys have bumps and
bruises. I'll do what it takes."</TE>
<TE>   Considering the game was about 48 hours from the time when he was
struggling down that hallway, it will take something considerable.</TE>
<TE>   Considering Allison dominated the ice again Saturday, scoring the
first goal off his leg and knocking Colorado guys everywhere, the
Kings desperately need a healing.</TE>
<TE>   "He's running the show here," said Bryan Smolinski, who also
scored.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche players have figured that out. It should be no
surprise that Allison's injury was caused by the guy who probably
knows it best.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't quite a passing of the torch, it was more like a
thumping of the butts.</TE>
<TE>   But, yes, late in the second period, that was Rob Blake who spun
around and flattened Allison against the boards.</TE>
<TE>   Old standards crushing new ideals. Past heroics nailing future
hopes.</TE>
<TE>   Blake skated off to defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Allison staggered off to victory.</TE>
<TE>   Blake has no goals and two assists in this series, with a
minus-two ratio.</TE>
<TE>   Allison, with many more chances, still has an impressive three
goals and three assists, with a plus-four ratio.</TE>
<TE>   King fans are thrilled that their new leader is every bit of
Blake, but with a little more punch.</TE>
<TE>   "When your superstar is out there hitting people, the average
player thinks, 'I've also got to be hitting someone,'" said the
Kings' Ian Laperriere.</TE>
<TE>   After the hit, Allison nearly collapsed, barely hanging on to the
boards before being helped to the dressing room before the end of the
period.</TE>
<TE>   He missed half of the third period, then showed up and skated a
few shifts, but appeared tentative.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings need this like they need a hole in the Zamboni.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Deadmarsh is out. Philippe Boucher is out. Ziggy Palffy has
been nullified.</TE>
<TE>   From the time he smacked Eric Messier just moments into Saturday's
game, until the time he gave late interviews in a back locker room so
nobody would see him stand up and limp, Allison showed again that he
is the tough-guy leader of this team.</TE>
<TE>   "You're talking about a guy who thrives on the pressure games,"
said Eloranta.</TE>
<TE>   And a guy who hasn't missed a game since being traded here in
November.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt, he'll be on ice Monday in Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings only hope he can fly like Hartley's mouth, as the
Colorado coach later took a few cheap shots at Murray in the manner
of his few cheap-shot players.</TE>
<TE>   "You listen to the radio, you watch TV, you read the paper, and
it's Andy, Andy, Andy all the time," said Hartley. "He's the guy that
gets the most coverage in the first round when you guys should be
focusing on ..."</TE>
<TE>   Hartley then listed just about every person in the house but
Dancing Boy, followed by one more shot directly into the Kings'
dressing room.</TE>
<TE>   Of Murray's allegedly publicity seeking, Hartley said, "Even his
players are fully aware of this."</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to see how Hartley could know what the Kings are
thinking, seeing as he obviously can't figure out his own
underachieving team.</TE>
<TE>   It's also difficult to imagine that he could forget the emotion
involved in trying to push a seventh-seeded team into the second
round.</TE>
<TE>   While Hartley certainly has earned the right to send in his thugs
to finish a game, Murray also has the right to complain about it.</TE>
<TE>   It's what good coaches do. It's about propping up your team as it
fights for its breath. It's about walking the walk.</TE>
<TE>   It's not personal, it's hockey.</TE>
<TE>   Hartley's comments make you wonder if his suddenly uncomfortable
team has become distracted from that fact.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, if he's talking about Monday night in Colorado, Hartley
has it all wrong.</TE>
<TE>   It's going to be about Jason, Jason, Jason.</TE>

<HD>Monohull's Time Is of First Magnitude</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICH ROBERTS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>ENSENADA, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Long Beach boats and a Long Beach yacht designer dominated the 55th
and fastest Tommy Bahama Newport to Ensenada Yacht Race when the
first six monohull boats beat the record of 11 hours 54 minutes set
by Roy E. Disney's Pyewacket in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Doug Baker's sleek Andrews 70, Magnitude, led the way in what
designer Alan Andrews called "perfect wind" after fighting off rivals
in the last few miles to finish first in the final hour before
midnight Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   "No words to describe it," Baker said, alluding to Disney's
near-legendary status in the sport.</LD>
<TE>   The first actual finisher was Bill Gibbs' 52-foot catamaran
Afterburner from Ventura, which started 20 minutes after the largest
monohulls, but finished about 61/2 minutes ahead of Magnitude in a
time of 11:17:27.</TE>
<TE>   However, that missed the race's multihull record by 41/2 hours.
Disney, vice president of the Walt Disney Co., didn't sail in the
race this year because he is campaigning Pyewacket in the Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   Magnitude, in a time of 11:23:53, was ahead of Bob Lane's Medicine
Man, 11:27:47; David Janes' J-Bird III, 11:30:24; Bill Turpin's Alta
Vita, 11:34:52; Al and Vicki Schultz's Vicki, 11:36:02, and Mike
Campbell's Victoria 5, 11:41:53.</TE>
<TE>   Magnitude, Medicine Man, Vicki and Victoria 5 represent Long Beach
yacht clubs. J-Bird III is from Newport Beach and Alta Vita is from
San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Magnitude and Vicki are ULDB 70 "sleds"; J-Bird III, Alta Vita and
Victoria 5 are Transpac 52s, and Medicine Man is a one-of-a-kind
Andrews 62. The numbers indicate boat length.</TE>
<TE>   Andrews, who sailed on Medicine Man, designed the four Long Beach
boats and J-Bird III.</TE>
<TE>   "A record is produced not only by having fast boats but perfect
conditions," Andrews said. "We had the wind off our beam the whole
way, which is the ideal point of sail for maximum speed."</TE>
<TE>   James McDowell's Santa Cruz 70, Grand Illusion, from Redondo
Beach, missed the previous record by 31/2 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The 452 boats that started at noon Friday sailed into a strong
breeze of 15 knots that built to as high as 24 knots into the
overcast night.</TE>
<TE>   The wind strength and westerly wind angle allowed the boats the
rare advantage of following the direct "rhumb" line for the
125-nautical mile course--inside the Coronado Islands at the
international border instead of the long way around outside the
islands.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a real boat race," Lane said. "We all had our moments in
the sun."</TE>

<LD>As affairs go, it was brief, a couple of hours at the Playboy
Mansion, and I was back with the Kings Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Regrets? Sure, I had some. I'm man enough to admit I was crying
most of the afternoon on Miss March's shoulder, feeling a little
guilty that I wasn't with the guys in Denver. Or it could have been
Miss January--when their name tags come off it's really hard to tell
the difference.</LD>
<LD>   I know I said I wouldn't shave until the guys won the Stanley Cup
or were eliminated. But I thought a beard might identify me as a King
fan, and doing my research on who might be Playmate of the Year, I
noticed every Playmate had "King fans" listed under "turnoffs."</LD>
<TE>   I know how shallow that makes me sound, and I was worried how this
might affect my relationship with Jason Allison and the guys, but
they seemed more interested in how I did than how they played.</TE>
<TE>   "So, Coach, how about that seventh game in Colorado?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Where are the pictures?" said King Coach Andy Murray, and I hope
he hadn't promised them to the guys for motivation.</TE>
<TE>   "How about that first goal by Allison?" I said when I got the
chance to talk with Craig Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fine," Johnson said, "but now tell me, how was it? They
tell me there's a zoo up there. Were you by the zoo? I mean, how was
it?"</TE>
<TE>   The guys have done pretty well on their own, but maybe a little
motivation might help. I wonder if I can get Hef to promise them a
trip to the Grotto if they beat Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   I won't be able to be in Denver, of course, because I have to play
golf. But I'll be happy to show them around the Mansion when they get
back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'M HEARING country singer Garth Brooks has expressed interest in
joining the Anschutz Empire's efforts to bring the NFL to town. I
wouldn't be surprised if a call isn't made to John Elway soon too.</TE>
<TE>   I'M ALSO hearing the Anschutz Empire has a date in the next two
weeks to visit the NFL in New York. The plan is to emerge from that
meeting with a term sheet that will allow the Anschutz Empire to
pursue the Chargers, Colts or Saints and get one of them to commit to
moving into a new football stadium a few blocks from Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   The key to the deal is a "G-3" loan from the NFL for $150 million
toward the construction of a new stadium--money that essentially
never has to be repaid. At least 24 of the NFL's 32 owners must
approve such a loan. NFL bylaws also dictate such a loan must be
given to an NFL team--rather than a city on the prowl for a team--so
the Anschutz Empire will have to gain a commitment from a team on the
move relatively soon to proceed with stadium plans and construction.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, the Los Angeles Chargers selected a cornerback in the
first round of last week's NFL draft.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE KING coach made a big deal out of not getting Colorado goalie
Patrick Waugh mad, so what did the Staples Center operations people
do? They put together a video of all the goals Waugh has given up and
played it on the overhead scoreboard, because as one Staples official
said, "We think we can get into Waugh's head." Apparently he was
right.</TE>
<TE>   JUST MY opinion, but something is shady when $118,000 comes in to
Hollywood Park from Lewiston, Maine, on a horse that has taken in
only $11,000 in bets, and wins.</TE>
<TE>   Someone has an unfair edge. But we know this, they aren't sharing
their information with our handicapper Bob Mieszerski, because after
four days Bob has only eight winners.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HARLAN'S HOLIDAY is expected to be the favorite when the Kentucky
Derby is run Saturday, but we probably won't know for sure until all
the money has come in from Lewiston, Maine.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ALBERT BELLE, all those years the reluctant interview, calling up
the Jim Rome show to defend himself after former teammate Omar
Vizquel wrote in a book that all of Belle's bats were corked, is
pretty funny. It would have been a lot funnier had Rome refused to
talk with him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOX'S JEANNE Zelasko recently gave birth to Trevor Jayden, and the
baby's father, Channel 7's Curt Sandoval, is doing just fine. That
is, he was until he heard the child's uncle call his new son "T.J."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE LAKERS have won 17 consecutive games in Staples Center, and
they didn't think the home-court advantage was worth playing hard for
every night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN HBO Real Sports' James Brown asked Rasheed Wallace if he
needed counseling for his inability to control his temper, Wallace
said, "No," but said if someone like his wife said he needed it, he'd
be more inclined to pursue it. So Brown asked Wallace's wife, and she
said, "No," proving the point that love really is blind.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE ICE skating judge, Marie-Reine Le Gougne, who was embroiled in
the Olympic controversy, said last week, "I have no intention of
letting myself be decapitated." Remember, she hails from France.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE AGENT for Anna Kournikova says the topless pictures that
Penthouse magazine is running in a 10-page layout are not of the
tennis player. You know how agents are--I think you'll have to see
for yourself.</TE>

<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in a letter from Phoelicks:</TE>

<TE>   And don't forget Playmates too.</TE>

<LD>It seems that Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko of Japan will be
attending the World Cup final and closing ceremony on June 30 in
Yokohama.</LD>
<LD>   Knowing the predilection of emperors--in fable, if not in
fact--one presumes the emperor will be wearing some clothes. It's
difficult to be certain, however, because dress is becoming quite the
topic of debate as the World Cup approaches.</LD>
<LD>   Take Nigeria, for instance. Last week fans of the Super Eagles
were in an uproar over the new look of their national team--not the
players who make up the team, but the jerseys those players wear.</LD>
<TE>   Nigeria, which will play Argentina, Sweden and England in the
first round, unveiled lemon-colored jerseys April 17 in a 2-1 win
over Scotland. Fans loved the result but hated the jerseys.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not aware of anything negative against the kits," Nigeria
Football Assn. marketing chief Edozie Enemuo told Agence
France-Presse. "What we know is that they are of high quality and
made of reflecting fabric to help the players cope with the heat."</TE>
<TE>   Unless Nigeria returns to its traditional green, it is the fans
who are likely to turn up the heat.</TE>
<TE>   Cameroon, meanwhile, has come up with a different solution. During
the Indomitable Lions' victorious march to the African Nations Cup
title in Mali in February, Coach Winfried Schaefer's squad sported
something entirely new in soccer fashion: jerseys without sleeves and
featuring a novel ventilation system that allowed fans more than a
brief glimpse of the players' torsos.</TE>
<TE>   The basketball look drew a frown from FIFA's World Cup Organizing
Committee, which said that such attire would not be tolerated at
Korea/Japan '02.</TE>
<TE>   Undeterred, Cameroon's seamsters union went back to work and came
up with another version that got a nod of approval from the FIFA
fashion police.</TE>
<TE>   "They have now come back with another design of their own, quite
an ingenious one, which has been accepted," said FIFA spokesman Keith
Cooper.</TE>
<TE>   Details of the new look, still featuring Cameroon's bright green,
red and yellow colors, are being kept secret, which is perhaps why
Cameroon has chosen the remote town of Nakatsue, on the southern
Japanese island of Kyushu, for its pre-World Cup training camp. Wild
boar and raccoons are said to be more prevalent than people in the
mountain redoubt.</TE>
<TE>   Cameroon, the Olympic gold medalist in 2000 and African champion
in 2002, plays Ireland, Saudi Arabia and Germany in the first round
of the World Cup and has a good chance of advancing to the next
round.</TE>
<TE>   In its opening game against the Irish in Niigata, Japan, on June
1, it will be the Indomitable Lions' uniforms, as much as their play,
that will be the focus of attention.</TE>
<TE>   While Cameroon is shedding clothing to beat the heat, England is
heading in the opposite direction. Its players will be sporting
jackets on the sideline, if not on the field.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Sven-Goran Eriksson is from Sweden, so it's not altogether
surprising that England's players will be told to don special
sleeveless white jackets that have been soaked in water and frozen
before use.</TE>
<TE>   The jackets, developed by NASA and designed to help athletes sweat
less and avoid dehydration, contain mysterious crystals that help
maintain a constant low temperature for several hours.</TE>
<TE>   "The ice jacket has been proved to help athletes handle the high
temperatures out there [in Japan and Korea], and we are confident it
will work," Richard Hawkins, deputy head of the English Football
Assn.'s Medical and Exercise Science Department, told England's News
of the World.</TE>
<TE>   It was in Sweden, of course, that a 17-year-old by the name of
Pele first grabbed the headlines, scoring two goals against Sweden in
the final to help Brazil win the 1958 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since, Pele jerseys have been gold, and not just in color.
Last week, their value again was underlined when a financially
hard-pressed amateur club in Chile decided to put its most valuable
asset up for auction.</TE>
<TE>   According to a report from Reuters, Deportivo Monjas has "kept the
treasure, unwashed and in a glass frame, at their clubhouse--a
rundown wooden hut on a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean in the
gritty port city of Valparaiso," for the better part of 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   It is a shirt worn by Pele when he helped Santos win its third
Brazilian championship in a row in 1962. How Deportivo Monjas
acquired it is a tale in itself.</TE>
<TE>   As the story goes, Andres Urrejola--now 61 and living in
Brazil--was a Chilean student who attended Santos' game against Sao
Paulo at Pacaembu Stadium four decades ago. At the final whistle, he
ran onto the field and virtually wrestled the jersey off Pele.</TE>
<TE>   The escapade was featured in a Brazilian newspaper, and afterward
Urrejola donated the jersey to Deportivo Monjas, his favorite team.</TE>
<TE>   The club finds itself strapped for cash and has put Pele's jersey,
now a faded white with the famous No. 10 sewn in black on the back,
up for bid on a Latin American Internet auction site,
www.deremate.com.</TE>
<TE>   Bids started at $30,000, and the auction runs through Saturday.
"If we get $60,000 or even $70,000, we will be happy," club spokesman
Marcelo Hernandez told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   Only last month, a shirt worn by Pele during Brazil's victory over
Italy in the 1970 World Cup final in Mexico fetched a record $224,600
at Christie's auction house in London. It was sold to an anonymous
phone bidder.</TE>
<TE>   The previous record for a soccer jersey was $146,800, paid for one
that belonged to Geoff Hurst, who scored a hat trick in England's
1966 World Cup final victory over West Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever scores the winning goal at this year's final in Yokohama
could find himself with some valuable threads. Of course, it's not
the clothes you wear, it's who wears them.</TE>
<TE>   Even Emperor Akihito could tell you that.</TE>

<HD>There's Gold at the End of Their Lines</HD>
<DH>Outdoors: Weather is cold, but fishing for rainbows is
hotter than usual at Eastern Sierra trout opener.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CROWLEY LAKE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>A winter-like storm blew through this region Friday night, and
Saturday morning there were rainbows almost everywhere you looked.</LD>
<LD>   Some were more radiant than others. Some were large, others small.</LD>
<LD>   None was as beautiful as the one filling the eyes of Breeanna
Cason. Or so the 8-year-old from Canoga Park believed, because she
was the one who caught it.</LD>
<TE>   "It weighed 2.08 pounds," she said, inspecting her prize. "It was
really hard to reel it in, so I asked my dad to help me."</TE>
<TE>   Her dad, with his back to his daughter at the Crowley Lake Fish
Camp cleaning station, was getting some help as well, from some other
adults in his group of seven. After five hours on the water, they had
teamed to land 35 rainbow trout--five-fish limits for all.</TE>
<TE>   "As you can see, we did really well," Roger Cason said.</TE>
<TE>   By about noon it was as clear as the powder-blue sky that everyone
at Crowley had done really well. An estimated 7,000 turned out for
opening day of the Eastern Sierra general trout-fishing season, and
if any of them got skunked, they must have had one of those invisible
dark clouds hanging over their heads.</TE>
<TE>   Anglers stood shoulder-to-shoulder at the cleaning table and when
one person finished there was always another to take his place. In
every direction, people were walking around with loaded stringers.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Department of Fish and Game biologists who take care
of this sprawling fishery just south of Mammoth Lakes and east of
U.S. 395, had reason to be pleased.</TE>
<TE>   When the final numbers are tabulated today or Monday, they are
expected to reveal that the average opening-day angler at Crowley
caught at least four fish, averaging more than a pound apiece, at a
rate of about one per hour.</TE>
<TE>   Crowley's rainbows put on the greatest show--a 5.4-pounder was the
biggest by late afternoon--but there were plenty of cutthroats in the
mix, indicating that the DFG's attempt to add some spice to the
fishery with an ambitious cutthroat stocking program is working.</TE>
<TE>   As for the opener in general, fishing was good to excellent from
Bishop to Bridgeport.</TE>
<TE>   Convict Lake produced the biggest fish, an 8.12-pound rainbow
caught on yellow Power Bait by Mike Thomas of Yorba Linda. It also
produced the biggest fish story, one with a raccoon swiping a
stringer that held a 3.65-pound rainbow and running for the hills.</TE>
<TE>   "Some kids yelled at it and he let go, so I still got my fish,"
said Pat Bauer of Long Beach. "But he took it a good 10 feet up the
hill."</TE>
<TE>   The higher lakes such as Convict were highly productive, as they
usually are on opening day. But, as she seems to do every opener,
Mother Nature was making her presence known and making anglers pay
for their success.</TE>
<TE>   At Twin Lakes in Bridgeport, fishermen braved snow, rain and,
ultimately sunshine, but they could hardly bask as 30-mph winds were
blowing them all over the water. Still, some nice fish were caught
throughout the Bridgeport area, the nicest being a 7-pound 6-ounce
brown trout caught by Ruben Black of Woodland, Calif., on a sinking
Rapala at Lower Twin.</TE>
<TE>   On the June Lake Loop, high winds were less of a factor at all but
Silver Lake, but it was windy nonetheless, and bitter cold--so cold
that Jordan Bickell, 13, of Cypress, almost cried. "I didn't cry," he
assured, "but I was in so much pain I thought my toes were going to
break off."</TE>
<TE>   By late afternoon on the Loop, an 8-pound rainbow caught at Gull
Lake by Wayne Wallace of Alhambra was holding first place in the
big-fish contest there.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace, 53, said he was walking around in waders "just
stupid-fishing with yellow Power Bait" when the big fish struck. "He
bent me over well," he said. "Then he ran off on a good run and
crossed some other guy's line, who then started yelling that he had a
big fish. I had to tell him that the fish was mine and that all he
had was a tangle."</TE>
<TE>   It takes two to tangle, and tangles come with the territory on
opening day for all but the brave--read foolish--few who beat the
crowds by starting their fishing before the sun is even close to
rising.</TE>
<TE>   Marlon Meade of Anaheim is one such person. Because fishing is
legal 24 hours a day in Inyo County (night fishing is illegal in Mono
County), Meade has it in his head every opener to be the first to
land his five-fish limit.</TE>
<TE>   He not only starts at midnight, but he does so on the upper
reaches of Bishop Creek, where the temperature often drops to the
point where toes will freeze unless properly covered.</TE>
<TE>   Meade reported watching schools of trout swimming around under the
light of a full moon, and that the moon affected the trout in a way
that made them not want to eat his mini-jigs in the manner they
usually do.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he fooled some nice ones, including two rainbows in the
five-pound class. Asked how cold it was, he said it was so cold that
the eyes on his fishing rod kept icing up to the point where the line
couldn't pass through, "which also made fishing tough."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't get much warmer, but fishing got better a few hours
after the sun came up. The rainbows started to show in good numbers
after about 10 a.m., the biggest and one of the most radiant a
7-pound 8-ounce Alpers Ranch-raised lunker that struck a Kastmaster
being pulled through the creek by Glenn Hittner of the Bay Area.</TE>

Rijo Grand
Cincinnati
right-hander Jose
Rijo continued his
amazing comeback
Saturday, making
his first start at
Cinergy Field since
1995 and pitching
six strong innings
in the Reds' 8-4
victory over San
Francisco. Rijo,
who turns 37 on May
13, didn't pitch in
the major leagues
for five seasons
because of arm
trouble, undergoing
elbow surgery five
times. A look at
his statistics
since his comeback
in 2001 and for his
career, which
started with the
New York Yankees in
1984:

RIVALRY RENEWED
The Giants' Barry Bonds had a
double in two at-bats Saturday
against Rijo but has struggled
against him in his career. In
the 1990 National League
championship series, Bonds,
then with Pittsburgh, was held
hitless in six at-bats by
Rijo--in his third season with
the Reds--and finished the
series batting .167 with one
RBI. The Reds went on to win
the World Series, with Rijo
winning two games and being
selected most valuable player

<LD>My wife reads The Times cover to cover every Sunday. Knowing that I
have an interest in the business of entertainment, she pointed out the
comments made by several young writers in the magazine's "Passing
Through" feature ("Auditioning for That Writing Credit," Metropolis, by
Michael T. Jarvis). I was struck by these hopeful writers' lack of
understanding of the business world. To ask and answer the question,
"What blockbuster film do you hate?" demonstrates my point. To the
business person, a blockbuster film (i.e. one that nets, not grosses, a
large amount of money) is a good film. It is not a subjective question.
Perhaps if a young writer were to look at the industry from that
perspective, he or she would find more success.</LD>

<HD>Rulings Strengthen CIF's Position</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a time when they perhaps need it most, the California
Interscholastic Federation and comparable high school governing
bodies across the nation have received boosts in legal power in
recent weeks after rulings in court cases that originated in San
Diego and Tennessee.</LD>
<LD>   As the CIF grapples with recruiting and transferring issues--the
Southern Section passed a stricter transfer rule Thursday--it and its
10 member sections were the beneficiaries of a decision by the state
Supreme Court on April 10.</LD>
<LD>   The court declined to review an appellate court decision that
overturned a ruling finding CIF bylaws "facially unconstitutional,"
all but ending a five-year battle that challenged the CIF's
definition of due process and contested the CIF's "undue influence"
rule created to deter recruiting.</LD>
<TE>   Also, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a similar case on
April 12, upholding a decision by the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals that a recruiting rule created by the Tennessee Secondary
School Athletic Assn. (TSSAA) does not violate the 1st and 14th
Amendments.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long and expensive road to go down with these two
cases," Southern Section Commissioner James Staunton said. "But it
came back around full circle."</TE>
<TE>   The first case involved the CIF's San Diego Section and John Ryan,
a student from Australia who was declared athletically ineligible in
1997 at Rancho Buena Vista High because of alleged undue influence by
football Coach Craig Bell.</TE>
<TE>   An initial decision by the San Diego Superior Court in August 2000
ruled that under the due process clause of the California
Constitution, the CIF failed to provide minimal procedural due
process to athletes and coaches who were charged with violations.</TE>
<TE>   The trial court decision also found unconstitutional the CIF
bylaws that made illegal the presence of "undue influence" in
transfer situations, potentially throwing open the door to
nonpunishable recruiting.</TE>
<TE>   But in an opinion upheld by the state Supreme Court, the 4th
District Court of Appeals in San Diego reversed the initial decision,
ruling that "the opportunity to participate in interscholastic
athletic activities is a privilege, not a right or an entitlement"
that warranted due process protection.</TE>
<TE>   "To conclude otherwise would entitle a student to invoke state
constitutional procedural due process protections upon the suffering
of any educational disappointment, whether it be the failure to make
a varsity squad, to obtain an acting role in a school theatrical
production, or to represent the school on an academic team," the
court ruled.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan, the appellate court said, "was provided an adequate
opportunity to be heard in a meaningful and reasonably timely
fashion."</TE>
<TE>   The appellate court also found that substantial evidence supported
the San Diego Section's charge of undue influence. For example, at
Bell's request, Robert Ryan sent pictures of his son standing,
sitting and dunking a basketball, court documents said. Ryan's father
also contacted Bell, requesting assistance in finding housing for his
son.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a home run for the CIF," said Christian M. Keiner, an
attorney with the CIF general counsel's office. "Given that ruling,
the current CIF procedures are constitutional."</TE>
<TE>   The Tennessee case also began in 1997, after the TSSAA banned
Brentwood Academy, a parochial school that had won nine state
football championships, from the football and boys' basketball
playoffs for two years because it violated recruiting rules by
inviting incoming ninth graders to participate in spring football
practice.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, a district court in Tennessee ruled that the TSSAA's
recruiting rules were unconstitutional restraints that prohibited
lawful speech and freedom of assembly. Like the Ryan case, the
decision appeared to allow room for nonpunishable recruiting while
allowing schools the right to sue high school athletic associations
for violating a member's civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, however, the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
reversed the initial decision, saying the TSSAA was not an actor of
the state and therefore could not be sued for violation of
constitutional rights.</TE>
<TE>   But in February 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the TSSAA
was a state actor subject to being sued for violation of
constitutional rights and remanded the case to the 6th Circuit.</TE>
<TE>   In August 2001, the 6th Circuit held that the recruiting rule
facially does not violate the 1st Amendment and Brentwood Academy's
right to free speech. The Supreme Court refused to hear the case
again earlier this month, leaving in place the ruling by the circuit
court that the TSSAA's recruiting rule on its face was
constitutional.</TE>
<TE>   The only issue remaining is whether the recruiting rule as applied
to Brentwood Academy violated the school's free speech rights. That
part of the case was remanded to the U.S. District Court for the
Middle District of Tennessee and will be argued in August.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a ways to go before we're home yet, but I'm pleased
with where the association stands at this point in the proceedings,"
said Rick Colbert, the TSSAA legal counsel. "It would have been
difficult to write a recruiting rule without any teeth at all. Its
pretty scary to think things that aren't even allowed to go on at the
NCAA level could go on at high schools and with eighth graders."</TE>
<TE>   Similar relief has been felt by the Southern Section.</TE>
<TE>   "Our governance has been pretty well established by the courts and
state," Staunton said. "If it got down to it, I'd be willing to put
my faith behind our rules. I don't want to spend money on arguing in
the courts, but I'd be willing to do so in order that the public
arena sees the CIF is attempting to do the right thing."</TE>

<DH>Horse racing: Foal dates provide an odd and entertaining
insight to picking a winner at Churchill Downs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>If they brought back Cole Porter to write a song for the 128th
Kentucky Derby, he might try something like, "Too Inscrutable for
Words." While that title doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, Porter
would have found a way to make it work.</LD>
<LD>   This Derby, to be run Saturday at Churchill Downs, is confusing
all around, so puzzling that Mike Battaglia, the track's longtime
linemaker, is also bewildered. The number might come down slightly by
Wednesday, when post positions are drawn, but right now Battaglia
considers Harlan's Holiday a 5-1 favorite. It's unheard of, in any
race, for a line to start at 5-1, but Battaglia has surveyed this
mishmash of 20 horses and taken the easy way out: He's making
everyone a longshot.</LD>
<LD>   The time-tested methods of dosage, dotage and dual qualifiers are
of no help. Dosage, a highly subjective analysis of stamina based on
pedigree, was suspect from the start, and lately it has hit upon hard
times. Too many horses with putative distance limitations have been
winning the 11/4-mile Derby. Dual qualifying, a system that
piggybacks on dosage (no further explanation here--go to your local
library), has been a bust. In the last 14 years, nine of the Derby
winners weren't dual qualifiers.</LD>
<TE>   Dotage was an antidote to dosage, a healthy diversion conjured up
by John Nelson, the clever Associated Press writer. Nelson had a nice
run with his pastiche--adding the age of the horse's owner to the age
of the trainer and betting the highest total--but after Paul Mellon,
85, and Mack Miller, 71, won the Derby with Sea Hero in 1993, dotage
as an institution had no place to go but down.</TE>
<TE>   What the 128th Derby needs is a fresh system, one with equal parts
fact and whimsy, and with apologies to Andy Beyer and his number
crunchers, The Times today gives you Foal Dates, courtesy of the
Jockey Club, the national repository for equine birthdays.</TE>
<TE>   For years, readers have been clamoring for Foal Dates, and their
time has come. What a boon this study would have been in 1984.
Trainer Woody Stephens' top 3-year-old, Devil's Bag, was injured and
retired, yet Stephens still won the Derby with his second-stringer,
Swale, who beat those false favorites, the Wayne Lukas-trained filly
entry of Life's Magic and Althea. Foal Dates is proud to reveal that
Swale was foaled on April 21, 1981. In 1974, Stephens trained
Cannonade, another second-stringer that won the Derby, and he, too,
was born on April 21.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Derby has had a goodly share of foaling doubles.
Kauai King, the 1966 winner, was born April 11, the same foaling date
as Citation, who swept the Triple Crown in 1948. Chateaugay and
Canonero II, the respective winners in 1963 and 1971, share the same
foaling date--April 24. Ditto Seattle Slew and Genuine Risk, who won
the Derby only three years apart and were both born on a Feb. 15.
Pleasant Colony, who won the Derby in 1981, the year after Genuine
Risk, ran his race on May 2, only two days before his third birthday.
Spend A Buck, foaled on the same date as Pleasant Colony, won the
1985 Derby on May 4--his birthday.</TE>
<TE>   All horses, of course, officially gain a year every Jan. 1. But in
real time, Northern Dancer didn't turn three until May 27--25 days
after his 1964 Derby victory. The Canadian-bred colt still wasn't
three when he won the Preakness, the second leg of the Triple Crown,
two weeks after the Derby. In the last 40 years, there has been no
older winner of the Derby than Northern Dancer. Foaling dates of
Derby winners before 1960 are hard to come by.</TE>
<TE>   More to the point of this year's Derby, in the last 34 years, 25
of the winners were foaled in February and March. The only January
foal to win since 1968 was Grindstone in 1996. Thunder Gulch, the
1995 Derby winner, was foaled on May 23 and is the only May foal to
have won the race in the last 17 runnings.</TE>
<TE>   Based on this, you can throw out Perfect Drift, the Spiral Stakes
winner, in this year's Derby. Foaled on April 29, 1999, he is the
youngest horse in the Derby. April 29 is not May, but it's close
enough. That's what the dosage guys would say.</TE>
<TE>   You can also eliminate Blue Burner. What's that old lyric (Frank
Loesser-Arthur Schwartz), "They're either too young or too old..."
Blue Burner was foaled on Jan. 21, making him the oldest horse in the
race. He will not be another Grindstone.</TE>
<TE>   Other throwouts, because they were April foals, are favored
Harlan's Holiday, Buddha, Medaglia d'Oro, Easy Grades, Ocean Sound
and Sunday Break, should he wind up running.</TE>
<TE>   That still leaves 14 horses. Johannesburg, Castle Gandolfo, War
Emblem, Saarland, Request For Parole, Wild Horses and U S S Tinosa
(an iffy starter) were foaled in February. The March foals are
Essence Of Dubai, Came Home, Private Emblem, Proud Citizen, Lusty
Latin, Windward Passage and It'sallinthechase.</TE>
<TE>   It appears that U S S Tinosa and Sunday Break, short on earnings
in graded stakes, are not going to run. In an executive decision,
Foal Dates is dismissing It'sallinthechase, ninth-place finisher in
the Arkansas Derby and winless this year. Even if this colt had been
foaled on the same date as Citation and Kauai King, it would not
help.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out that seven of the final 14 had foal dates that were
the same as Derby winners: Essence Of Dubai-Real Quiet;
Johannesburg-Gato Del Sol, Came Home-Lil E. Tee; Request For
Parole-Silver Charm; Wild Horses-Affirmed; and Windward Passage and
Proud Citizen, both born on the same date as Alysheba.</TE>
<TE>   To narrow this group, Foal Dates has taken the easy way out by
resorting to the definitive Man o' War tiebreaker. Man o' War may not
have won the Derby--didn't even run in the race--but he makes a good
tiebreaker. He was foaled in Kentucky on March 29, 1917. Lil E. Tee
was also a March 29 foal, as was Came Home.</TE>
<TE>   That's good enough for Foal Dates. Came Home's winning the Santa
Anita Derby is only an afterthought.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tempera, winner of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, has a
fever, missed training Saturday and her status is questionable for
Friday's Kentucky Oaks.... Sky Terrace might be headed for the
Preakness on May 18 after his two-length victory Saturday in the
$100,000 Derby Trial at Churchill Downs. Cashel Castle, who finished
second, lost for the first time in six starts. With the track sloppy,
there were three scratches--the favored entry of Mayakovsky and Shah
Jehan, and Stephentown.... John Mabee, leading owner and breeder and
longtime leader of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club who died Wednesday,
will be buried privately Tuesday. A visitation is scheduled for 4-6
p.m. Monday at the El Camino Memorial Park in San Diego, and there
will be a memorial service Wednesday at the Del Mar track at 12:15
p.m.</TE>

<LD>Rocco Mediate's long putter took him a long way in the first three
rounds of the Greater Greensboro Chrysler Classic in North Carolina.</LD>
<LD>   Mediate, putting better than his PGA Tour statistics indicate,
shot a six-under-par 66 Saturday for a two-shot lead over Mark
Calcavecchia heading into the final round.</LD>
<LD>   Mediate began the week 140th on tour in putting average, but
needed only 25 putts in his third round and 77 through 54 holes.</LD>
<TE>   "I've worked on a few things with my right-hand grip and slowed my
pace down a lot--you know, things that we as professionals change
every other day," Mediate said.</TE>
<TE>   Mediate, the Greensboro winner in 1993, began the third round one
stroke behind co-leaders Calcavecchia and Robert Gamez, but birdied
his first three holes at Forest Oaks Country Club to tie for the
lead. Mediate bogeyed his next two holes to fall from the top of the
leaderboard as quickly as he got there. He rebounded on the back nine
with three birdies in four holes for an opportunity for his fifth PGA
Tour victory.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Jacobs combined a sizzling putter with his trademark long
drives to shoot a six-under-par 66 for a one-shot lead in the
Countrywide Tradition, the Senior PGA Tour's first major, at
Superstition Mountain, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Thorpe, who began the day in a three-way tie for the lead,
chipped in from about 30 feet for an eagle on the par-five, 553-yard
18th hole to complete an up-and-down day and pull within a shot of
the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs was at 10-under 206 through 54 holes on the 7,228-yard
Prospector course at Superstition Mountain Golf &amp; Country Club.
Thorpe shot a 70 for a nine-under 207. Bob Gilder birdied the 18th
and was two back at 208.</TE>
<TE>   After playing even par through the first two rounds, Jack Nicklaus
struggled to an 81 on Saturday. Because of an ailing back, Nicklaus
has not played a full tournament since July.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just worn out. I couldn't make anything happen," Nicklaus
said. "I hit three greens in regulation today. Nothing was any good.
It wasn't that my back hurt that much. I was just tired."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Garcia shot a five-under-par 67, building a five-stroke
lead after three rounds of the Spanish Open at Las Palmas, Canary
Islands.</TE>
<TE>   Emanuele Canonica of Italy shot a 70 and is second at 207. Greg
Owen of England was at 208, tied for third with 17-year-old Spanish
amateur Rafael Cabrera.</TE>

<LD>Jockey Chris McCarron was unable to make history with an
unprecedented victory Saturday in the $106,100 Hawthorne Handicap at
Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   McCarron's inability to become the first rider in the history of
the track to win the same race six years in a row was through no
fault of his own.</LD>
<LD>   Ask Me No Secrets, his mount in the Grade III and the 8-5 favorite
on Russ Hudak's morning line, was scratched, leaving McCarron unable
to continue a streak that began with Twice The Vice's victory in the
1997 Hawthorne.</LD>
<TE>   In a race reduced to only five starters after the scratch of
Stormy Society, Queen Of Wilshire--the fastest horse
remaining--easily gained command early, then held off 7-5 favorite
Alexine to win by a nose in 1:43 for the 1 1/16 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Queen Of Wilshire, owned by Ernest Auerbach's E A Ranches and
trained by Darrell Vienna, was the 2-1 third choice with jockey
Patrick Valenzuela. It was the sixth win in 17 starts for the
6-year-old Major Impact mare.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vienna's other stakes score came about three hours earlier when
Suances, making only his second start since the spring of 2000, led
every step of the way under jockey David Flores and won the $216,250
San Francisco Breeders' Cup Mile at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Suances, owned by Red Baron's Barn, was the longest shot in the
four-horse field at 7-2. He slowed the early pace and had more than
enough late to win by a length in 1:35 over the turf. A winner of
five of seven racing in France and Spain, the 5-year-old Most Welcome
horse had been out for 21 months because of injury when he returned
in the Explosive Bid Handicap at the Fair Grounds last month and
finished 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Decarchy, the even-money favorite, was second, then came The Tin
Man and Sarafan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unrullah Bull, a 6-1 shot, won the $300,000 Texas Mile on Saturday
at Lone Star Park.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-year-old Conquistador Cielo horse, ridden by Tony Lovato,
completed the distance in 1:37 3/5. Reba's Gold, the 3-2 second
choice, was second and 6-5 favorite Hal's Hope was fourth.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After a rash of pick six carryovers--25 to be exact--at Santa Anita,
there has not been one in the first four days of the Hollywood Park
meet. That could change this afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to the third California Gold Rush, full fields are the
order of the day in Inglewood and the races restricted to California
breds are wide open.</LD>
<LD>   There is also a $1-million guaranteed pool in the pick six. If
nobody wins all six today, there will be a hefty carryover into
Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   The pick six begins in the fifth, the $200,000 Melair Stakes,
where Bella Bella Bella will try to get back on track in her debut
for trainer Neil Drysdale.</TE>
<TE>   The other pick six races are the $70,000 Lakeview Thoroughbred
Farms Stakes at seven furlongs, the $175,000 Khaled Stakes, which
Spinelessjellyfish will be trying to win for a third consecutive
year, at 11/16 miles on the turf; the $250,000 Snow Chief Stakes at
11/8 miles, the $70,000 Big Jag Stakes at seven furlongs and the
$60,000 Gourmet Girl Stakes for maiden fillies and mares at 61/2
furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Female sprinter Go Go makes her first start of
the year in the $150,000 B. Thoughtful Stakes at seven furlongs. The
race is the third on the Gold Rush card.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Fit For A King. The amazing 9-year-old will try for his
eighth consecutive win in the $175,000 Khaled Stakes.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Alfredo Miranda. The jockey won once in his first 40
mounts at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Adminniestrator and Our
Main Man in the first; Public Domain, Political Rhetoric,
Onetrickphoney and California Power in the second, and singling Go Go
in the third.</TE>

<HD>He's Top-of-the-Line Substitute</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>King forward Eric Belanger has played mostly as a center for Coach
Andy Murray the last two seasons, so he was as surprised as anyone to
find out before Saturday's Game 6 that he was replacing injured wing
Adam Deadmarsh on the team's top line.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't have a clue until I walked in before the game and saw my
name on the board," said Belanger, who has been used mainly as a
checking forward since returning off the injured list nearly a month
ago.</LD>
<LD>   Skating with Jason Allison and Ziggy Palffy, Belanger didn't do
anything fancy, but he played well enough to get the job done. In 16
minutes 16 seconds of ice time, Belanger had two shots on goal and
won eight of 15 faceoff attempts. He also blocked three shots and had
two steals.</LD>
<TE>   "I just tried to stay focused," Belanger said. "It's a totally
different game playing wing. ... With Jason and Ziggy, they read off
each other so well. I think I did a good job of playing with them.
The key is to get the puck out and to get it to those guys. That's
what Adam has been doing, and I just tried to do the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the offensive firepower Colorado has, Murray was not
worried about Belanger skating with Allison and Palffy.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt that Eric checks well, skates well and has offensive
instincts that would be a good fit on that particular line," Murray
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a real challenge for him to have the opportunity
to play there and I thought he responded very well. His puck pursuit
and puck possession was very good. I thought he was very solid."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colorado was without Peter Forsberg, but the Avalanche did have
forward Milan Hejduk, who sat out the final 20 games of the regular
season and the first five games of the series, back in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "In the first period, I felt kind of weird because it was like I
was somewhere else and not on the ice," Hejduk said. "I felt better
after that."</TE>
<TE>   Hejduk did not open up on Colorado's top line, but after the Kings
took a 2-0 lead, he joined Alex Tanguay and Joe Sakic for the
majority of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "For a guy who has not played in a long time, I thought that
[Hejduk] played a decent game," Colorado Coach Bob Hartley said. "He
had a real good [scoring] chance there in the second period."</TE>
<TE>   Lonnie White</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After failing to close out the Kings in Games 5 and 6 for the
second year in a row, is doubt starting to creep in among the
Avalanche?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think so," said King defenseman Aaron Miller, traded from
the Avalanche last season.</TE>
<TE>   "We did the same thing last year and I thought their best game of
the series was Game 7. They were all over us."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings still rue their 5-1 loss in Game 7 at Denver last May.</TE>
<TE>   "We were a little upset last year," center Bryan Smolinski said.
"We had a chance to put them out and move forward. We weren't
satisfied and hopefully we have the monkey off our back. We want to
go in there [Monday night at Denver] and play a solid game and maybe
steal one."</TE>
<TE>   If they win, the Kings would jump right into another rematch,
playing the Detroit Red Wings in a Western Conference semifinal
series that probably would start Thursday night at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, the Kings lost the first two games of a first-round
series against the Red Wings before winning the next four to advance
to play the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   With a victory over the Kings on Monday, the Avalanche would play
the San Jose Sharks.</TE>

<LD>Dashing Knud, extremely productive as a 2-year-old in 2000, will be
trying to end a losing streak when he runs in tonight's ninth race.</LD>
<LD>   Dashing Knud, owned by Gordon Knudsen and Vessels Stallion Farm
and trained by Danny Cardoza, has lost four in a row but will be
favored to win the $12,900 allowance at 350 yards.</LD>
<LD>   Dashing Knud, the winner of the Los Alamitos Million and Golden
State and Ed Burke Memorial futurities in his first year of
competition, will be ridden by Kenny Hart. He was second in the
Kaweah Bar Handicap on April 6, his first race since July 27.</LD>
<TE>   Six races earlier, Wynhurst, a 6-year-old thoroughbred gelding,
will try for his fourth victory in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Danny Scott and trained by Ray Thomas, Wynhurst will
break from post two and will have five opponents at 41/2 furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   He will be ridden by Ramon Guce.</TE>
<TE>   It will not be an easy task for the son of Mt. Livermore because
three other horses in the race are coming off victories. Easter Chief
won on March 22, Solongrestsina won at 9-2 on March 30 and Ourenay
scored a 7-1 surprise on April 13.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Tam's Rebelette. 2. Seldom Lies. 3. Wynhurst. 4.
Dozen. 5. Rex Royal. 6. It Happens. 7. Sir Elton. 8. Big Mouth. 9.
Dashing Knud.</TE>
<TE>   Four! In the sixth, let's use It Happens and Baltana, Sir Elton,
Barbsbully and Splash Of Gucci in the seventh, Big Mouth, A S Demon
and Contreras in the eighth and single Dashing Knud in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Mister Really had a troubled beginning and now
debuts for a new barn in the third while Feathered Friend is a win
type (15 of 69 in his career) who could wake up in the fifth with the
switch back to jockey Adolfo Rodriguez.</TE>

<LD>Mini Rock lived up to her billing, winning the $161,700 La Primera
Del Ano Derby at Los Alamitos on Saturday night. The 4-5 favorite won
the 400-yard race in 19.62 seconds, earning her fifth victory in 11
career starts.</LD>
<LD>   The race was over after the break with Mini Rock breaking quickly
and remaining unrattled despite the prerace nerves of Sister TA in
the adjacent gate.</LD>
<LD>   "It was fortunate to have her break well," winning jockey Joe
Badilla said. "She ran a very fast time and ran a good race."</LD>
<TE>   The victory gives trainer Blane Schvaneveldt a record 350 career
stakes victories at Los Alamitos, and his fourth La Primera Del Ano
Derby victory. Schvaneveldt won in 1981, 1986 and 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "I came here in 1968 and never thought I'd win 350 races,"
Schvaneveldt said. "I started training for Jay Parsons [owner of Mini
Rock] in 1971 and I've been training for the Parsons ever since."</TE>
<TE>   Mini Rock's first-place finish was worth $67,914.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pete Sampras, winless in 24 tournaments since taking his seventh
Wimbledon title in 2000, beat second-seeded Andre Agassi, 6-1, 7-5,
Saturday night at Houston to advance to the final of the U.S. Men's
Clay Court Championship.</LD>
<LD>   Sampras will play third-seeded Andy Roddick, a 6-3, 2-6, 6-2
winner over Argentina's Guillermo Coria.</LD>
<LD>   Sampras is 19-14 lifetime against Agassi, but it was only the
second time in five meetings that Sampras beat Agassi on clay.</LD>
<TE>   "Just playing him is unique," Sampras said. "Whether we're playing
a practice match on a side court or in the finals at Wimbledon, he
raises my game to another level."</TE>
<TE>   The best game was the 12th and final one, after Sampras broke
Agassi to take a 6-5 lead.</TE>
<TE>   With Sampras serving for the match, Agassi fought off four match
points before Sampras ended it with an ace.</TE>

<TE>   A rift between Jennifer Capriati and captain Billie Jean King,
coupled with Monica Seles' upset loss to Austria's Barbara Schwartz,
has the United States on the verge of elimination in the Fed Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati, the No. 2 player in the world, was dismissed from the
team late Friday for breaking King's rules about practices. It meant
the U.S. had to forfeit a singles match Saturday, starting the
best-of-five event trailing, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Then Seles lost her match to Schwartz, ranked 75th in the world,
7-6 (9-7), 6-2, at Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S., which has a record 17 Fed Cup titles, is one match from
failing to advance to the second round. The Americans last lost in
the first round of Fed Cup competition in 1997, to the Netherlands.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati's absence was not popular with the 3,200 fans at the Olde
Providence Racquet Club. King was booed as she was introduced before
play began, and during her opening remarks to the crowd, a fan yelled
out "Where's Jennifer?"</TE>
<TE>   Meghann Shaughnessy, the No.12 player in the world, will make her
Fed Cup debut in a must-win match today against Schwartz. Seles will
play Evelyn Fauth, then Raymond and Shaughnessy will team to play
Schwartz and Marion Maruska in doubles.</TE>

<TE>   Lleyton Hewitt, the world's No.1 player who had not dropped a set
all week, lost, 6-4, 7-5, to Argentina's Gaston Gaudio in the
semifinals of the Open Seat Godo tournament at Barcelona, Spain.</TE>
<TE>   The unseeded Gaudio, ranked 62nd in the world, has not lost a set
at the Godo tournament, defeating four seeded players to reach
today's final. He will play Spain's Albert Costa, who defeated
Guillermo Canas, 6-2, 2-6, 6-3.</TE>

<TE>   Quarterback Rich Gannon was a conspicuous no-show for the Oakland
Raiders' voluntary minicamp this weekend. ESPN reported last week
that Gannon's contract was the reason he did not attend an earlier
quarterback orientation. Oakland Coach Bill Callahan wasn't bothered
by Gannon's absence, but said he hopes any issues are resolved soon.
Gannon is expected to attend the mandatory minicamp in June.</TE>

Hunkie Cooper.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Jackson had 11 receptions for five touchdowns and a

seven touchdowns for the Avengers (1-1).</TE>

four-day tournament. USC, with help from Stadler's finish and Ben
Hayes' fourth-place tie, won the team championship for the second
consecutive year and 17th time overall, finishing four under.
Stanford finished second and Oregon State finished third.</TE>

<HD>Detroit Completes Its Comeback, 6-4</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Detroit Red Wings let the Vancouver Canucks back into Game 6, but
they didn't let them back into the series.</LD>
<LD>   Nicklas Lidstrom and Brett Hull scored short-handed goals 30
seconds apart in the second period as the Red Wings eliminated the
Canucks with a 6-4 victory Saturday at Vancouver, Canada.</LD>
<LD>   "They're such a good team that you don't want to give them a
chance to beat you," said Hull, who added two more goals as the Red
Wings completed their comeback from a 2-0 series deficit and avoided
a Game 7 in Detroit on Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Vancouver rallied from an early 2-0 deficit in the first period
and was on a power play looking for its first lead since Game 2. But
Detroit's Kris Draper snared the puck and went hard to the net on a
short-handed rush. He was stopped, but he collided with goalie Peter
Skudra, and Lidstrom fired the loose puck into the net with the
goalie on the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "That is basically the game," said Hull, who doubled the Detroit
lead when Chris Chelios sprung him on a breakaway during the same
Vancouver power play. "That really got our momentum going."</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 1, New Jersey 0--Ron Francis scored on a second-period
power play and Kevin Weekes made 32 saves as the Hurricanes
eliminated the two-time defending Eastern Conference champion at East
Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   It was only the second series victory in franchise history and it
ended a streak of nine consecutive series losses. The only other
series the franchise won was a three-game sweep of Quebec in 1986,
when the team was the Hartford Whalers.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 2, Boston 1--Richard Zednik is at home, resting, and the
other Canadiens knew that if they tried to get even for the injury
that put him there they would soon be joining him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think both teams are smart enough and disciplined enough that
they know what's at stake here," defenseman Sheldon Souray said after
the Canadiens took a 3-2 lead in the first-round playoff series at
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't forgotten what happened, but we aren't going to throw
away the season because we're trying to exact revenge."</TE>
<TE>   Jose Theodore stopped 43 shots as the Canadians moved within a
game of advancing to the second round. Boston, which finished the
regular season with the best record in the Eastern Conference, will
face elimination Monday in Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   On the day that Zednik was released from the hospital--and Bruin
defenseman Kyle McLaren had a disciplinary hearing for the hit that
put him there--both teams played with discipline and put aside the
harsh words that threatened to turn the game into a rumble.</TE>
<TE>   McLaren, who has been suspended indefinitely, met with NHL
discipline dean Colin Campbell before the game and declined comment
afterward. The league said a decision on the length of the suspension
would not be released immediately.</TE>

<LD>The Colorado Avalanche certainly did not have the look of a champion.</LD>
<LD>   With a chance to send the Kings packing for vacation, Coach Bob
Hartley's bunch seemed to fall apart before Saturday's Game 6 began
after learning that Peter Forsberg would not be in the lineup because
of a leg injury.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Avalanche played the regular season without Forsberg
and finished with the second-best record in the Western Conference,
it didn't have the same spark without him in a 3-1 defeat to the
Kings in front of a boisterous sellout crowd at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   "Forsberg is not playing and he didn't play for a reason," Hartley
said. "You always hope that a player like Peter will play, but in the
end, it is basically the player's decision."</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg, who did not play during the regular season because of
foot and ankle injuries, participated in warmups before the game but
pulled himself out of the lineup because of an undisclosed leg
injury.</TE>
<TE>   He is expected to play in Monday's Game 7 at Pepsi Center.</TE>
<TE>   "If nothing really happens, yes, I will be playing in Game 7,"
Forsberg said. "I'm not going to give details right now.... It's not
related to the [ankle] tendon [which required surgery].... I took
warmups to see if it was good enough to play and I realized that it
wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   Without Forsberg in the lineup, the Avalanche played the first
period as if it were the Mighty Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   In falling behind, 2-0, Colorado did not do many things correctly.</TE>
<TE>   Pucks Avalanche defensemen usually kept in the Kings' zone eluded
them. Power-play passes that used to go stick to stick turned into
turnovers, and King shots that the Avalanche normally blocked ended
up being goals.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed like we were trying to find an easy way to do it,"
Colorado defenseman Adam Foote said. "We got ourselves into a
situation where we've been before. There's no looking back now. We
can sit here and dwell and be negative, but the bottom line is that
we're in a Game 7. We know that we have to leave it all out there
now."</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche failed to do that in Game 6.</TE>
<TE>   "After the warmup, we saw that Peter didn't feel good and decided
not to play," defenseman Martin Skoula said. "When we didn't have him
during the season, a lot of guys stepped up and played well for us.
That didn't happen today."</TE>
<TE>   Although Colorado outshot the Kings, 24-20, most of the shots by
the Avalanche came in the third period, when it was desperate. With
forward Adam Deadmarsh and defenseman Philippe Boucher out of the
lineup because of injuries, the Kings frustrated Colorado by keeping
their game plan simple after jumping out to a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of taking chances offensively, the Kings were content to
make the Avalanche work for goals.</TE>
<TE>   The tactic worked behind goaltender Felix Potvin, who made one
great stop after another.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we frustrated them," said forward Eric Belanger, who
skated in place of Deadmarsh on the Kings' No. 1 line. "It's always
hard to tell about what they're thinking, but you can tell they had
trouble with us playing a simple game with so many key guys out. We
just didn't try and do too much and it worked."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings were at their frustrating best when Colorado had a man
advantage. The Avalanche failed to score on six power plays.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you can struggle in different areas, trying to press
too much," Foote said. "It's like everyone is trying a little too
hard. We have to let it happen."</TE>
<TE>   Added defenseman Rob Blake: "We have to score when we're on the
power play. ... We had a couple of opportunities to make the game a
little closer but we didn't.... They are committed to blocking and we
have to find a way to get the puck through there."</TE>
<TE>   After the Kings' overtime victory in Game 5, the Avalanche
complained about Craig Johnson's winning goal. The Avalanche did not
have that problem after Saturday's game because the players knew the
Kings outplayed them.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's a blessing in disguise to have to play a Game 7,"
Foote said. "Sometimes stuff happens. We can't get caught up in what
everyone else thinks. We have to bear down together as a unit.</TE>
<TE>   "Every playoff run that I've been in there's been good times and
bad times.... We know what we have to do."</TE>
<TE>   Fixing its power play, which has not scored a goal since Game 2,
is high on the Avalanche's list.</TE>
<TE>   "We had some good chances, but we couldn't get the puck in," said
Colorado captain Joe Sakic, who did not score for the second
consecutive game despite having five shots on goal.</TE>

goalie Patrick Roy on this play, but the Kings did manage two early
goals, which allowed them to focus on defense.</CP>

<HD>Injury Puts Peca Out of Playoffs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>UNIONDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>New York Islander captain Michael Peca will miss the rest of the
playoffs and probably part of next season after tearing a ligament in
his left knee on a hit by Toronto's Darcy Tucker.</LD>
<LD>   Peca was injured in the second period of New York's 6-3 loss to
the Maple Leafs on Friday night in Game 5 of their Eastern Conference
quarterfinal series. The Leafs lead the best-of-seven series, 3-2.</LD>
<LD>   Game 6 is today at Nassau Coliseum.</LD>
<TE>   Peca, who is expected to be out at least six months, was hit a few
seconds after he had passed the puck. Tucker closed in on him and
bent at the knees to deliver the hit low to Peca's legs. Peca went
end-over-end and fell on the ice. No penalty was called on Tucker.</TE>
<TE>   The two players had been trading barbs through the media--and on
the ice--for several games. According to Peca, Tucker had threatened
during games to "kill" or hurt him. Peca called the talk "comical"
before Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   Islander General Manager Mike Milbury, said it's "not so comical
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   "You know, when a guy's carrying the puck and he releases it, you
have a right, within a certain time frame, to hit him," Milbury said.
"This was a bit late and clearly low. I think he knew exactly what he
was trying to do. He told us he was going to do it."</TE>
<TE>   In Toronto on Saturday, Tucker said he went low on the check to
avoid any possibility Peca could throw a shoulder into him. As far as
warning he would hit Peca, Tucker said he didn't know what Milbury
was talking about.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just finishing my check," Tucker said. "I don't know what
the big hoopla is about."</TE>

<LD>Light-heavyweight contender Julio Gonzalez stopped Joseph Kiwanuka
after seven rounds on a technical knockout Saturday night in front of
5,049 at Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<LD>   Kiwanuka (27-5-2), a Uganda native now living in Las Vegas,
endured a flurry of punches that left him profusely bleeding. Doctors
declared Kiwanuka unfit to come out for the eighth round.</LD>
<LD>   Huntington Beach's Gonzalez (29-1) was fighting for only the
second time since July 28, 2001, when he lost a 12-round unanimous
decision to defending WBA, WBC and IBF champion Roy Jones Jr.
Gonzalez knocked out Tyrone Armstead in the second round in February.</LD>
<TE>   Joey Torres, 41, making his professional debut after spending
nearly 23 years in prison for murder, hit the mat nine seconds into
his light-heavyweight bout with Perry Williams but gathered himself
and won with a second-round knockout.</TE>

<HD>UCLA Catcher Reaches Record</HD>
<DH>College softball: Nuveman ties NCAA home run mark of 85
with two-run blast in victory over Stanford.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINA TELLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stacey Nuveman makes her home behind the plate, but it's what UCLA's
catcher does in the batter's box that has generated the most
attention.</LD>
<LD>   Nuveman, a 6-foot senior from La Verne, on Saturday tied the NCAA
softball career home run record, shared by former Arizona players
Leah Braatz and Laura Espinoza. Her two-run shot in the third inning
off Stanford's Maureen LeCocq was the 85th in her career and her 15th
of the season, and it helped the Bruins (43-6, 11-3 in conference
play) to a 13-2 Pacific 10 Conference victory.</LD>
<LD>   Nuveman knew the record was within her reach. After all, she hit
20 home runs her freshman season, 31 as a sophomore and 19 last
season. But after hitting only eight home runs in 35 nonconference
games this year, the milestone didn't appear much closer.</LD>
<TE>   Since the start of Pac-10 play, however, Nuveman has seven home
runs in 14 conference games.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's top slugger is also a disciplined hitter who leads the team
with a .537 batting average.</TE>
<TE>   Her patience at the plate paid off against Washington earlier this
week. In the bottom of the sixth, UCLA trailed, 3-0, when Nuveman
came up with the bases loaded. But instead of trying to clear them
with one swing, Nuveman drilled a two-strike pitch up the middle to
drive in a run.</TE>
<TE>   Two batters later, sophomore Claire Sua became the day's hero with
a grand slam over the center-field fence. Nuveman cheered the
loudest.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of kids would have been hacking for the fence, but
[Nuveman] really stayed within herself," Coach Sue Enquist said.
"That was very impressive. Those are the things that are going to get
us to the end."</TE>
<TE>   Asked what she is most proud of as a softball player and Nuveman
will talk about the 2000 Olympics. Not the gold medal she won as a
member of the U.S. team, but of the perspective and focus she gained
from the experience.</TE>
<TE>   "Talk about pressure and a big game--it doesn't get any bigger
than that," Nuveman said. "Perspective-wise, it's helped a lot
because I've been on the biggest stage and I know what it feels like.
Now, when I come out here, I take the game for what it's worth and
not let things get too big."</TE>
<TE>   Though her name is in the record book, records are made to be
broken, and Nuveman is fine with that.</TE>
<TE>   "If I break both knees tomorrow and softball's over for me, I know
I've developed the person," she said, "and that's something that goes
beyond the white lines. That will take me lot farther than a home run
record."</TE>

<LD>"Nobody's going to touch Stewart," one coach said.</LD>
<LD>   "He's just so hot," said one opponent.</LD>
<LD>   "You can pencil him in [as champion]," said another coach.</LD>
<TE>   Malibu High senior Doug Stewart has been the talk of boys' tennis
all season, and he did nothing to shut up anyone with a commanding
6-2, 6-1 victory over Aaron Yovan of Irvine University in the CIF
boys' interscholastic singles championship match of the 102nd Ojai
Valley tennis tournament Saturday at Libbey Park.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second consecutive loss in the boys' 18 final for
Yovan, who fell last year to Patrick Buchanan in three sets. He also
advanced to the boys' 16 final and won the boys' 14 division in
previous years at Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to be in the final, but I'd like to be winning this
stuff. It's like 'Here we go again,' right?" said Yovan, who also had
plenty to say about Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   "His groundstrokes are amazing. He just played a perfect match,"
Yovan said. "Trying to force a third set against him ... it's a tough
task."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, who won the Ojai boys' 16-and-under title last season,
hits with depth and power from both sides. He had Yovan pinned deep
all match, breaking him in the fourth and sixth games of the first
set. The rout was nearly complete once he broke Yovan in the second
game of the second set.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much tradition and history," Stewart, last spring's
Southern Section champion, said of Ojai. "I was looking at the trophy
and there's so many people on there that I recognize."</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Riggs, Stan Smith, Jack Kramer ... Doug Stewart?</TE>
<TE>   "I like the attention," said Stewart, who accepted a scholarship
from Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other finals:</TE>
<TE>   Woodbridge junior Elizabeth Exon won the girls' 18-and-under
division title with a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Dana Hills junior Kady

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The semifinals of the Pacific 10 Conference individual championships
were a showcase for two players who have come a long way recently.</LD>
<LD>   Juniors Rodrigo Grilli of UCLA and Jewel Peterson of USC found
their way to today's Pac-10 men's and women's finals, respectively,
with victories Saturday at Libbey Park in Ojai.</LD>
<LD>   Grilli, a polished transfer from College of the Desert who won the
last two Ojai community college men's singles titles, has traveled a
long road to UCLA from Sao Paulo, Brazil. He defeated Washington
junior Matt Hanlin, 6-3, 6-4, in the semifinals.</LD>
<TE>   "I wanted to accomplish this," said Grilli, who has played
anywhere from No. 2 to No. 4 in the Bruins' lineup. He has been
bothered by a groin injury this season but wasn't slowed against
Hanlin.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson showed she has developed more consistency and a taste for
tough competition with a 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 victory over Cal sophomore
Raquel Kops-Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Grilli, winner of the state community college singles championship
last season and doubles championship the last two, plays in the final
at 11 a.m. today against Washington freshman Alex Vlaski, a 4-6, 7-5,
6-3 winner over UCLA sophomore Marcin Matkowski.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson will play Stanford's Gabriela Lastra, a 6-4, 6-7 (4), 7-5
winner over teammate Erin Burdette, at 9:30 a.m. Peterson and Tiffany
Brymer, a former Southern Section singles champion from Oxnard Rio
Mesa, advanced to the women's doubles semifinals, but fell, 9-7, to
Kops-Jones and Christina Fusano.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson's showing continued a successful season for the Trojans'
No. 1 player. She won the Pac-10 Indoor Championship title earlier
this year and was a finalist in the Rolex Championships in November.</TE>
<TE>   "[Peterson] is a work in progress," USC Coach Richard Gallien
said. "She's got the skills and has developed the stomach to win
these kinds of matches. I'm more proud of her for that than
anything."</TE>
<TE>   In the community college men's division, Glendale's Scott
Patterson, who upset top-seeded Adriano Biasella of Desert, 6-1, 6-1,
plays Zoran Korac of Orange Coast in the final at 8 a.m. In the NCAA
Division III West regional men's final, John Cham-a-koon of
Claremont-Mudd will play Brian Casey of UC Santa Cruz.</TE>

<HD>Paus Sends Message During Scrimmage</HD>

<LD>Another slip-up off the field and Cory Paus is gone from UCLA's
football team.</LD>
<LD>   On the field, though, the senior quarterback looks as if he's
ready to hang on to his starting job.</LD>
<LD>   Paus, whose second drunk-driving conviction landed him in jail
last January, continued to work his way out of Coach Bob Toledo's
doghouse Saturday with a commanding performance in UCLA's intrasquad
scrimmage at Drake Stadium that concluded spring practice.</LD>
<TE>   Looking relaxed and confident, Paus directed the Blue team to
touchdowns on all four of its possessions with him at quarterback. He
completed nine of 13 passes for 211 yards and a touchdown with no
interceptions, and scored on a 17-yard run.</TE>
<TE>   "Cory Paus threw the ball extremely well," Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   But Toledo said he still intends to put off naming a starter until
he has time to assess incoming freshmen Matt Moore and Drew Olson in
the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing [Paus] has to understand with me is that he has to stay
out of trouble," Toledo said. "If he gets in any trouble, he's gone."</TE>
<TE>   Other standouts for the Blue team, which had the advantage of
first-string players, were tight end Mike Seidman and running back
Manuel White.</TE>
<TE>   Seidman, a 6-foot-5, 245-pound senior, scored the first of the
Blue team's five touchdowns, catching a pass from Paus on a crossing
pattern and running over a White team defensive back to complete a
54-yard play. Seidman's one-handed grab on a 37-yard pass from Paus
set up a one-yard touchdown run by tailback Akil Harris.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in the best shape of his life," Toledo said of Seidman, who
had three catches for 95 yards. "He's grown a lot in the last four
years. He knows it's his time and it's his job, and he's taking
advantage of that opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   White, a 6-3, 240-pound sophomore, gives the Bruins options
because he can play tailback or fullback. He had 67 yards in six
carries, including a six-yard touchdown. Harris, a junior regarded as
the team's other top runner, had 33 yards in four carries.</TE>
<TE>   Wendell Mathis was the most impressive of UCLA's three redshirt
freshman running backs, scoring the Blue team's final touchdown on a
tackle-breaking, 61-yard run. He played on both teams and had 88
yards in four carries.</TE>
<TE>   Senior linebacker Marcus Reese had an interception for the Blue
defense, which shut out the White offense. Redshirt freshman John
Sciarra, playing mostly with the White team, completed 11 of 22
passes for 178 yards with no touchdowns and one interception.</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen Bruins sat out the scrimmage because of injuries but no
one was hurt Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Good to Last Flop, Kings Win at Utah</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Normally savvy Stockton makes key mistakes
and Sacramento overcomes Jazz tactics and fans to take 2-1 series
lead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Happily for the Sacramento Kings, learning to be a top-seeded team
the hard way, that which doesn't kill you is supposed to make you
stronger, even if it comes really close.</LD>
<LD>   For one brief, shining and loud moment, Utah Jazz Nation arose
from the mists Saturday as the fans, who have been melting away for
years, returned to call down the old thunder, only to see the Kings
gut it out down the stretch, coming from three points behind in the
last 1:19 to win this pivotal Game 3, 90-87.</LD>
<LD>   Struggling as mightily as the Kings have against the eighth-seeded
Jazz, they now lead the series, 2-1, knowing they can go home again.</LD>
<TE>   "Getting beat at home [in Game 2], the way we got beat [trailing
by 18 points in Arco Arena, where they were 36-5 this season], we
knew Utah was gonna give us a real battle," said King Coach Rick
Adelman. "We have a lot of young guys and they've never been in the
position where they're favored....</TE>
<TE>   "Even though [the Jazz] went ahead and even though it seemed
things weren't going our way, we were able to get through it and get
a very tough win. So I think it's got to do a lot for our guys'
psyches at this point."</TE>
<TE>   If their psyches are resting more comfortably today, it's because,
in a role reversal, John Stockton, wisest of the wise, assumed the
Kings' old knucklehead role, getting in early foul trouble, then
tacking on No. 3 in the second quarter trying to block a Mike Bibby
15-footer from behind ... and No. 4 in the third quarter, fouling
Bibby on a 20-footer, an even worse mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Then at the end, with the Kings leading, 86-85, and :32 left,
Stockton went for a steal at half-court and was called for his sixth
foul.</TE>
<TE>   While he was taking his seat on the bench, Peja Stojakovic made
two free throws, putting the Kings up, 88-85.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, we had to try get the ball back," said Stockton, looking
even bleaker than he usually does after losses. "If you need to foul,
you need to foul because they had the lead and the ball and time was
running down so that's the way it goes."</TE>
<TE>   Well, the Kings would have had to shoot with at least :08 left,
giving the Jazz a chance at a last shot, so maybe fouling wasn't the
right play?</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe not," conceded Stockton.</TE>
<TE>   It was your basic big game in the Delta Center, which is even
louder than Arco. The Jazz players, who are not only physical but
adept at getting calls, turned it into the usual slow-paced scrum for
the opponents and theater for the referees.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of veterans I've been talking to in the NBA told me to
expect to have the series not really be for us, that you're going to
have to fight through it and they were right," said the Kings' Chris
Webber. "It is a test, especially for a lot of us....</TE>
<TE>   "Especially for me, 'cause I want to play in a playoff game. I
want to have fun [and] do some great things and it's hard to do that,
sitting on the bench every game with foul trouble. I don't foul out
that much during the season."</TE>
<TE>   Webber is guarding Karl Malone--a sumo wrestler also adept at
anticipating contact ... or flopping--and isn't the first opposing
power forward to get in foul trouble here.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for the Jazz, which seemed to be pursuing, earning
and getting its customary calls, it turned around at the end.</TE>
<TE>   With 1:19 left and Utah up, 85-82, Andrei Kirilenko was called for
bumping Stojakovic on the dribble, 20 feet from the basket.
Stojakovic made two free throws, cutting it to 85-84.</TE>
<TE>   On the Kings' next possession, Stockton, anticipating Bibby's
move, stepped in front, took the contact, fell backward ... or
flopped ... only to see the call go against him.</TE>
<TE>   With :49 left, Bibby made two free throws, putting the Kings up,
86-85.</TE>
<TE>   With :25 left, Stockton committed his badly timed foul on
Stojakovic. The Kings, who made one shot from the field in the last
8:23, while missing six and turning the ball over four times, were on
their way to winning their biggest game of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it's an opportunity lost," said the disconsolate
Stockton. "You can say we've had two of those and nothing you can do
about it."</TE>
<TE>   Try not fouling jump shooters next time, but on behalf of the
young, no-longer-as-endangered top-seeded Kings, thanks, they needed
that.</TE>

<LD>Deep down Pepperdine knew it probably had a spot in the NCAA men's
volleyball championships regardless of the outcome of Saturday's
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation title match against Hawaii.</LD>
<LD>   The at-large berth into the Final Four would have surely gone to
the Waves, considering their glossy record and No. 1 national
ranking. But they also weren't about to surrender any momentum built
up during a winning streak that has stretched into two months.</LD>
<LD>   The Waves fought off every challenge put up by second-ranked
Hawaii in a 24-30, 30-25, 30-25, 30-27 victory before 2,589 at
Firestone Fieldhouse that gave them an automatic berth in the NCAA
playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   "There's no other way for us to go into the NCAAs," said outside
hitter Lance Walker, who had a match-high 18 kills. "We want to win
and we want to beat everybody. We want to show why we're No. 1."</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Sean Rooney had 16 kills, sophomore Fred Winters added 10
and junior Brad Keenan had a match-high 11 blocks.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves have set school records for wins, with 28, and winning
streak, 16 games.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this team has been as good as any collegiate team I've
coached in terms of being strong when things aren't going as well as
you hope they can go," Coach Marv Dunphy said. "Pretty good
composure."</TE>
<TE>   Walker helped power the Waves through the decisive third game.</TE>
<TE>   The senior had a kill to finish a 4-1 run that put Pepperdine
(28-4) up by three early. Later, he had a kill and a block to quell a
Hawaii rally. When the Warriors pulled to within 23-21, Walker had
two kills and a block.</TE>
<TE>   "Walker was a stud," Hawaii Coach Mike Wilton said. "He was more
than a handful all night long."</TE>
<TE>   Hawaii (22-8) tied the fourth game five times. A kill by Costas
Theocharidis, a service ace by Delano Thomas and a block by
Theocharidis tied the score, 25-25, setting up the possibility of a
fifth game.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas unloaded a serve into the net to give Pepperdine the lead
again. The Waves seized on the opening as Rooney hit a crosscourt
kill for a point and Daniels drilled a service ace away from the
outstretched hand of Eyal Zimet for a 28-25 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The run gave Pepperdine the breathing room it needed.</TE>

<LD>Michael A. Hiltzik's article about the "Spider-Man" screenplay
("Untangling the Web," Special Hollywood Issue, March 24) was carefully
researched and beautifully written. He spent the time and got it right. I
have represented writers in credit arbitrations for more than 20 years.
In that time, I have had one arbitration with 35 drafts and another that
spanned 16 years. Usually the Writers Guild is fair, but every once in a
while . . . .</LD>

<HD>For Mountain Lions, a Life and Death Study</HD>

<LD>Swirling clouds occupy the upper reaches of the San Jacinto
Mountains high above Borrego Springs, enveloping everything in a chill
dampness. A bullying wind shakes the trail-less chaparral through which
Ken Logan swims, crashes and pulls his way toward, he hopes, an encounter
with F-7.</LD>
<LD>   F-7 stands for "Female 7," an adult mountain lion traveling with her
two large male cubs. F-7 wears a $4,400 Global Positioning Satellite
collar that Logan, a PhD research scientist with the Wildlife Health
Center at UC Davis, had placed on her two months before. On four
consecutive days each month, for about 10 minutes each day, F-7's GPS
collar automatically transmits data that traces her whereabouts during
the preceding month. Today is a transmission day, and Logan must get
close enough for his receiver to pick up her collar's signals clearly.</LD>
<LD>   It is an exhausting trek. After nearly three hours, Logan has covered
scarcely five kilometers and is still a ridge line away from where a
small-plane pilot spotted F-7 the previous day. When transmission time
arrives, he tries to tune in a signal. All he gets is a slight chirp, a
faint signal from one of the cub's radio collars, somewhere far down
Borrego Palm Canyon. Today F-7 will remain a phantom, an electronic rumor
in the forbidding landscape.</LD>
<TE>   Logan is widely considered the country's premier mountain lion
researcher. He and his wife, Linda Sweanor, conducted a 10-year study of
the animals in the remote Chihuahua Desert and San Andres Mountains of
New Mexico. It is the most thorough ever. The couple moved to California
a year ago to study the complicated relationships among mountain lions,
bighorn sheep, deer and people in sections of the Anza-Borrego Desert and
Cuyamaca Rancho state parks.</TE>
<TE>   In California, mountain lion conservation has been passionately
contested for a generation, with environmentalists decrying the big cats'
loss of habitat and hunters and ranchers insisting the animals thrive too
much. Onto these turgid waters Logan hopes to pour the oil of
dispassionate science. His and Sweanor's work in New Mexico resulted in
that state's adopting a flexibile, science-based approach that permits
regulated hunting in some areas and nuisance kills in others, but also
establishes large no-kill zones.</TE>
<TE>   These days the emotional battle over mountain lion hunting in
California seems ironic. Although voters approved Proposition 117 in
1990, making California the only state that bans the practice, its
ultimate effect has been essentially moot.</TE>
<TE>   During 1970-71 and 1971-72, the only two seasons in which recreational
hunting of lions was legal in the state, sportsmen killed a total of 118.
In the year 2000, 149 of the creatures were tracked down and killed under
so-called "depredation permits," which allow the destruction of lions
deemed a threat to livestock, domestic animals or people.</TE>
<TE>   The undoing of Prop. 117 has been accomplished not by hunting
interests or ranchers but by the same relentless force that is squeezing
the wildness and wonder out of California life in so many other ways,
namely, human overpopulation and suburban sprawl. Today, in the state's
ever-expanding urban fringes, depredation permits are most commonly
issued for attacks on the pets and hobby animals of suburbanites who've
migrated to lion country and find to their shock that it's a wilder place
than, say, Irvine. Across the West we are now killing as many as 3,800
lions a year--more than triple the highest annual number during the 60
years when the creatures had a nuisance bounty on their heads.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody really knows how many mountain lions prowl California. Because
they're not game animals, there is no consistent monitoring of their
numbers (4,000 to 6,000 is the official guesstimate).</TE>
<TE>   The big cats are famously athletic, combative and ferocious, but they
avoid people. Increased sightings in recent years are likely due to
increased human intrusion on the large hunting ranges the animals
require, an average 120 square miles for an adult male.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the existence of so many humans in lion habitat is what drew
Logan and Sweanor to Southern California. "Linda and I wanted to see how
these mountain lions make a living in this highly peopled landscape,"
Logan says. "It all boils down to whether we want to coexist with them. I
think we can if we follow some simple rules, like keeping our domestic
animals in predator-proof enclosures at night. But if we don't want to
coexist, we'll kill every last one of them. Personally, I wouldn't want
to live in a place where there aren't predators on the wild landscape.
And I certainly wouldn't want to live in a society that did away with
them. Mountain lions are the last big, healthy, efficient predator in the
West."</TE>
<TE>   He's wrong on that last point, of course. With our off-road vehicles
and tract homes and desire for the easy life in difficult landscapes, no
matter the cost to other species, we know who really deserves the title.</TE>

<LD>Kansas state lottery officials got their money's worth when they
hired singer and character actor Ernie Lee Banks, 68, to impersonate
Louis Armstrong in TV promos for their "Scratchmo" game. The Hollywood
resident's lengthy resume includes gigs in more than 100 L.A. clubs,
appearances on TV shows such as "The Jeffersons" and "The X-Files" and
commercials for 1-800-COLLECT. We asked for a few notes.</LD>
<LD>   Tell us about about your unusual childhood.</LD>
<LD>   I was raised by my father's sister in South Philly. I joined the
Cetlin and Wilson carnival when I was 15 or 16. I'd sing on the black
show. The lady I married was a shake dancer. We toured on a train.</LD>
<TE>   Didn't you do a tour in the military?</TE>
<TE>   I was in the [Army's] 101st Airborne. I used to run off a lot and go
to Paris. I sang at the Moulin Rouge. I'd sit in with bands. I'd come
back on the 29th day so I wouldn't be called a deserter. That went on
until they threw me out.</TE>
<TE>   Did you go back to the carnival?</TE>
<TE>   No, I went to Holmesburg Prison in Pennsylvania in 1958. I got some
marijuana for a friend and the friend ended up being a cop. I got six
years for five joints. I was given leisure of the place. The warden liked
the way I did Elvis Presley impersonations. The warden didn't want to let
me go. They had no one to do the Easter program.</TE>
<TE>   And then you went back into show biz?</TE>
<TE>   I started singing in Philly with a guy named Ralph Green. In the early
'60s, Pearl Bailey liked us and we worked in Atlantic City in a place
called the Black Orchid. We came to L.A. on our own. We were partners on
and off for 10 years or more. We wore straw hats, and we were sharp.</TE>
<TE>   When did you start acting?</TE>
<TE>   In 1973 I did "The Jeffersons," "Good Times," bit parts on shows,
films like "The Black Godfather." I started singing solo in clubs in Los
Angeles and Santa Monica. In 1988 I played a minister on Broadway with
the Winans family and toured the East Coast in "Don't Get God Started."</TE>
<TE>   What was your best film or TV role?</TE>
<TE>   "King," about Martin Luther King Jr. I played Ralph Abernathy. He was
King's best friend. Also I liked working on "The Jeffersons." I played an
old friend of George's from Harlem. Those were two pieces I really
enjoyed doing.</TE>
<TE>   How did you start doing Louis Armstrong?</TE>
<TE>   I have a self-taught, gravelly voice. I was a doo-wop boy with other
guys on the street corner. I could never get do-re-me-fa-so-la-ti-do
right, but I could always sing Louis. In the late '80s, his music started
getting popular again. I perform at clubs and senior citizen homes. I've
performed Louis with a group. "What a wonderful world!"</TE>
<TE>   Do you have any advice for young performers?</TE>
<TE>   Back in the early days, I wish that I had known that I was worth
something. I should have known about not giving up and pursuing your
dreams.</TE>
<TE>   Any frustrations in your career?</TE>
<TE>   In talent shows, when I was young, Billy Paul, who sang "Me and Mrs.
Jones," would always come out ahead of me. I always came in second.</TE>

<LD>Horse racing fans are a unique breed. In a milieu rife with
superstitions, lucky charms and favorite jockeys, some bettors rely on
divine intervention while others just pick the names of horses they like.
We asked for hot tips at Santa Anita Park near the end of the winter
racing season.</LD>
<TE>Nola Kowalewski, 49, Santa Anita, bartender, Bradbury</TE>
<TE>   Favorite horse's name?</TE>
<TE>   Holy Nola, named after me by Mike Pegram, an owner here.</TE>
<TE>   Why horses rather than cards  or roulette?</TE>
<TE>   You can't love a card but you can love a horse.</TE>
<TE>   Will you bet a long shot?</TE>
<TE>   That's my game. Anyone can pick a favorite, but it takes a brain to
pick a long shot. What's your system?</TE>
<TE>   Experience, knowing the  trainer and putting all the pieces together.</TE>
<TE>   Lucky charm or superstition?</TE>
<TE>   Absolutely not. The Lord's my God. I don't believe in luck. It's not
in the Bible.</TE>
<TE>   Any advice for amateurs?</TE>
<TE>   Buy Toby Turrell's "Winners" sheet. He's out there every morning with
the horses.</TE>
<TE>   Biggest bet and biggest win?</TE>
<TE>   That's a secret.</TE>
<TE>Tony Cuda, 79, retired postal worker, Alhambra</TE>
<TE>   Favorite horse's name?</TE>
<TE>   Spectacular Bid. Seabiscuit is  a sentimental favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Why horses rather than cards  or roulette?</TE>
<TE>   I do both. I play in card tournaments. I used to like the big payoffs
in horse racing.</TE>
<TE>   Will you bet a long shot?</TE>
<TE>   If a horse is from a good mare, I'll bet it.</TE>
<TE>   What's your system?</TE>
<TE>   I'll analyze the race and the speed of the horse.</TE>
<TE>   Lucky charm or superstition?</TE>
<TE>   No.</TE>
<TE>   Any advice for amateurs?</TE>
<TE>   Bet small, bet cautiously.</TE>
<TE>   Biggest bet and biggest win?</TE>
<TE>   $1,000 [bet]; in 1986 I picked six and got back $12,000.</TE>
<TE>Nathaniel Newhouse, 45, professional gambler, Torrance</TE>
<TE>   Favorite horse's name?</TE>
<TE>   Affirmed. He showed his  potential as a 2-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   Why horses rather than cards  or roulette?</TE>
<TE>   You can pick or choose.  In roulette, you've got only  red or black.</TE>
<TE>   Will you bet a long shot?</TE>
<TE>   [It] depends on the jockey  and trainer.</TE>
<TE>   What's your system?</TE>
<TE>   An old system called a formula. It's based on the speed of the horse
at six furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Lucky charm or superstition?</TE>
<TE>   If the horse [relieves himself] before the race, I won't bet him.</TE>
<TE>   Any advice for amateurs?</TE>
<TE>   Don't be afraid.</TE>
<TE>   Biggest bet and biggest win?</TE>
<TE>   $250,000 [bet]; $500,000 [win]. I doubled my money on Affirmed.</TE>
<TE>Peggy Knox, 43, transportation specialist, Duarte</TE>
<TE>   Favorite horse's name?</TE>
<TE>   Seeking Miss Slew. Any horse with "Miss" in it.</TE>
<TE>   Why horses rather than cards  or roulette?</TE>
<TE>   You get a thrill while you gamble on horses. You can ride 'em in and
encourage them.</TE>
<TE>   Will you bet a long shot?</TE>
<TE>   It depends on the jockey/trainer combination.</TE>
<TE>   What's your system?</TE>
<TE>   I read the Racing Forum and keep my ears open. I hang around happy
people in a  winning section, not around the people who are losers before
they come to the door.</TE>
<TE>   Lucky charm or superstition?</TE>
<TE>   I take my time when I'm  betting.</TE>
<TE>   Any advice for amateurs?</TE>
<TE>   Have fun and do what you want. Everyone's a handicapper.</TE>
<TE>   Biggest bet and biggest win?</TE>
<TE>   $100; I won $2,900 from He's Tricky on Top. He's probably in the glue
factory now.</TE>

<LD>The words "Holmby Hills" and "free" don't usually go hand in hand.
But unsuspected by most culture vultures, a treasure trove of modern art
is open to the public for free in the same community that shelters the
Playboy Mansion and the home of TV magnate Aaron Spelling.</LD>
<LD>   A headless Botero sculpture juts discreetly above the neatly trimmed
hedge at the estate where art collector extraordinaire Frederick R.
Weisman lived until his death in 1994. An entrepreneur and philanthropist
who made his fortune as a Toyota distributor, Weisman purchased the 1920s
Mediterranean-style villa in the 1980s to showcase a stunning collection
of nearly 500 20th century artworks that reflects his penchant for
innovation, eclectism and, often, humor.</LD>
<TE>   Weisman and his wife, Billie Milam, relished living among art pieces
spanning the European Modernist to the Super Realist movements. The two
were prone to "midnight hanging capers," and each room remains as it
stood when Weisman passed away. An Ed Ruscha painting of a globe accented
by scallions is displayed on the ceiling in an upstairs den; a Duane
Hanson sculpture of an elderly Florida shopper clad in fluorescent
polyester top and shorts loiters in a downstairs hallway. In the living
room, a painting from Picasso's Blue Period shares space with a dainty
dancer sculpture by Robert Graham and a chunky granite Isamu Noguchi
table; a bronze by surrealist Rene Magritte adorns the study; and an Yves
Klein sculpture sits in the upstairs master bedroom, across from an Andy
Warhol painting. "People not used to modern art can relate to it in a
homelike setting," says Milam, who curates the collection and runs the
Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of the works that inundate the villa, grounds and adjoining
annex building is breathtaking, even to connoisseurs. As one New York art
collector put it, clutching her chest during a recent tour, "I thought I
had seen it all. I've never seen anything like this."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Docent-led tours are available to groups of as many as 15 on weekdays
by appointment; (310) 277-5321; www.weismanfoundation.org.</TE>

<HD>A Record Crop of Female DJs Hits the Clubs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW ASCH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One thing is clear from even a cursory tour of Southland
nightclubs: The vast majority of DJs are dudes, not ladies. To Clay
Young, a DJ who spins records at UC Irvine's KUCI as well as at parties
and small clubs, that was an injustice. In January, he and a group of
Orange County women took action and created "The Night of the All-Girl
DJ," a monthly Saturday club at Costa Mesa's Detroit Bar. "Because every
night is an all-male DJ night," says Young, 33. Society doesn't
"encourage women to do anything but look good."</LD>
<LD>   Young and company reflect a trend toward DJ gender equality.
Collectives such as L.A.'s Chicks in the Mix and the Bay Area's Sister SF
are rocking clubs of late, while DJ/producers such as Sandra Collins, DJ
Irene and the Angel have blazed paths in Southern California for more
than 10 years.</LD>
<LD>   Early results indicate that diversity at the turntable can be good
business. "Night of the All-Girl DJ" usually draws a multiethnic capacity
crowd. "It's a great concept," says Detroit Bar booking manager Chris
Fahey. "It not only appeals to the male desire to see beautiful women
DJ'ing, it's also a great chance to [let] women do their own thing
without musical boundaries."</LD>
<TE>   The group's aesthetic choices can only be defined as eclectic: Costa
Mesa-based Viva Roxx (nee Viva Meyer), 29, spins progressive house and
"breaks." Novice DJ Erin B (a.k.a. Erin Barrow) of Costa Mesa plays
experimental and general soundscape weirdness, while others choose goth
rock, jazz and African pop music, with a female-fronted rock band often
performing between sets.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other female DJ groups, the All-Girl DJs make no attempt to
politicize their art. Nonetheless, women bring a less aggressive, more
soulful approach to the DJ booth, says clubgoer Alissa Kueker on a recent
Saturday night at Detroit Bar. "But that doesn't mean it's pink and has
bows on it."</TE>

<HD>Mufflers and  Museum Pieces</HD>
<DH>In East L.A., a Repair Shop With a Vision</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABEL SALAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The El Pedorrero muffler shop pulses like a beacon amid the meat
markets, liquor stores and tire shops on Whittier Boulevard in East L.A.
Its exterior painted in eye-popping yellow and blue faux tile patterns,
this folk art landmark offers more than catalytic converters and balm for
the noisy exhausts alluded to in its name, a Spanish reference to, ahem,
flatulence.</LD>
<LD>   While their cars' mufflers are repaired, patrons are invited to browse
the shop's grounds, which are a veritable museum of art, bric-a-brac and
oddball junk. In a warehouse-sized shop space, fine art, folk art, kitsch
Americana and antiques are displayed in fantastic combinations. Working
traffic signals, religious icons, road signs and a phone booth on wheels
give way to ceramic figurines, a Model A Ford hot rod, toys, sculptures,
metal gadgets and a woman's torso carved from one piece of wood. Here and
there, some objects have been touched up with new brass or chrome
fittings, others anointed with racing flames and pin-striping.</LD>
<TE>   "Everything here has meaning," says proprietor Guillermo "Bill"
London, 66. El Pedorrero's burly Colombian American owner set up shop
here some 24 years ago. For more than 40 years, he has applied his
big-top, funny-paper sensibility and tinker's aesthetic to shaping his
enormous collection, which salutes his adopted country with items such as
an original newspaper account of Abraham Lincoln's assassination and a
framed copy of Nicole Brown Simpson's birth certificate. There's also his
own artwork on the tailgate of a truck, depicting the Statue of Liberty
and the Stars and Stripes under the date 9/11/01.</TE>
<TE>   On the boulevard in front of the shop, a mufflero man sculpted of junk
parts beckons next to a yellow-and-black custom Honda festooned with more
than 100 chrome tailpipe fins welded on at odd angles. The car, which
resembles a mutant Batmobile released from a manic wash-spin-dry cycle
and left to shrink in the sun, is operational; attendants fire it up each
morning and park it along Whittier, where a monster-size tractor tire on
the car's roof advertises a free muffler with each catalytic converter.</TE>
<TE>   El Pedorrero was part of a 1994 American Institute of Architects tour
and has been featured on the Univision network. "Journalists have come
from all over: Germany, Canada, Japan, even Channel 4 from England,"
London says.</TE>
<TE>   For London, even the shop's exterior paint has meaning. As he explains
it, yellow is the color most associated with caution, while postal blue
(the trademark shade used by the U.S. Postal Service) inspires
confidence.</TE>
<TE>   London, whose patrons are largely working-class immigrants from Mexico
and Central America, consciously keeps his prices down, a populist policy
that goes for his collection as well. "'It belongs to everyone, because
without others, I don't exist. Someone filled each of these objects with
their energy. I'm just the caretaker."</TE>

<HD>Sonoma's Struggle  With  Authenticity</HD>
<DH>As the Napa Valley Became Disneyland  for Wine Lovers, Sonoma
Remained  the Real Thing--a Genuine, if Unglamorous,  Farm Region. Now
It, Too, Is Succumbing  to Tourists' Notions of What 'Wine  Country'
Should Be.</DH>

<LD>'Course you know the standing joke about Healdsburg," Bruce
Campbell is deadpanning. We are rumbling through Sonoma County in a
livestock truck. Behind us, his tiny hometown, the new star of wine
country destinations, is a study in privileged leisure: bird song, pink
sky, dew in the vineyards, executives in line at the artisan bakeries
muttering into cell phones.</LD>
<LD>   Campbell is a study in something else entirely: plaid shirt, red
beard, thick belly, work boots that reek of--how to put it?--barnyard.
He's a sheep rancher. Actually, he's more like the sheep rancher, the guy
behind CK Lamb, which produces some of the most famously succulent Sonoma
lamb in the United States. Spago? That's his lamb. The Bellagio hotel?
That's his lamb. Campanile? Etc. To an extent, this 4-H judge with the
national food media write-ups shares the blame for the popularity that
has made over Healdsburg to the point that it now has its own punch line.</LD>
<LD>   "Best bread in the world," Campbell says merrily, pinching some snuff
from a Skoal can. "But no place for a man to buy underwear."</LD>
<TE>   It was not always thus. "Healdsburg used to be just a sleepy little
farm town," he continues. "Now . . . ."</TE>
<TE>   He spits into a foam cup. Now the old City Hall is a luxury food
market. Now smart, well-meaning people trail him into his driveway,
sweetly pestering him for designer lamb parts. His town square sports a
new hotel with $695 suites and a facade that appears airlifted from Soho;
in October, celebrity chef Charlie Palmer opened his new Dry Creek
Kitchen on its ground floor. Boutiques selling French antiques, flowers,
European clothing and high-end purses are opening next to an
international newsstand on the town's main drag. East Coast wine
merchants fly in for grade school fund-raisers on the chance that some
local has raided a private cellar for auction items.</TE>
<TE>   Now a low-gear community of 10,700 is hurtling into the fast lane--a
bittersweet shift even for those whose livelihoods depend on it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't spend a lot of time bemoaning that what used to be ain't,"
Campbell says. "But, oh, yes. This place has changed."</TE>
<TE>   Sonoma County used to be the spot that tourists visited when they had
an extra day to spend in the wine country. Sprawling, lovely and boring,
it was the farm annex to Napa Valley, where the real action was.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, Sonoma County is much larger than Napa and its wine industry
is far older (the birthplace of premium California winemaking is at the
Buena Vista headquarters near the town of Sonoma). But Napa was the place
with the chateaux and the "Falcon Crest" ambience and the European
connections and the marketing juggernaut of the Mondavi wineries. It was
Napa wine, mostly, that put California on the map at the now-historic
1976 Paris wine tasting. Sonoma County had wineries that outsiders
thought were in Napa, ocean breakers that outsiders thought were in
Mendocino, redwoods that outsiders thought were in Yosemite, and the
Russian River and the Bodega Bay school where "The Birds" was filmed by
Alfred Hitchcock. For many years--unless your turn-on was golden light or
utter quiet or rolling acres of emerald farmland--that about covered it.</TE>
<TE>   No longer. Now it's chic to come to Sonoma County. It is "Napa the way
Napa was before it got discovered," fans say. It is "Provence without the
ruins," "the New Normandy." It is the cradle of Liberty duck and Laura
Chenel goat cheese and Rocky the Range Chicken and some of the best Pinot
Noir on the planet. As a socialite told me over organic Sonoma mixed
greens one day in San Francisco, it is "where everyone is buying now that
Napa is all taken"-- meaning everyone in the market for country houses
and status wineries.</TE>
<TE>   It is also, to people who live there, still just Sonoma County--a vast
green swath of preposterous beauty shot through with the great California
fault lines of class and sprawl. Mention the place to someone who grew up
there and you'll get a dissertation on farm economics or the
redneck-on-Mexican high school race wars of the 1980s. Examine its
stereotypes and you'll get hippies who run for public office and cowpokes
with college diplomas. Its best known suburb is the town where Polly
Klaas was kidnapped. Visitors gush over the "authenticity" of the
landscape, but to the folks in the scenery, those fields and barns are
legacy and livelihood.</TE>
<TE>   For them, the news in Sonoma County is that the pressure to evolve has
been ratcheted up, big time. Sonoma County has had its share of tourism
for generations--some of its hot springs have been vacation spots since
the mid-1800s--but natives say that its profile has risen sharply in the
last several years.</TE>
<TE>   Sonoma datelines now riddle San Francisco society pages: Here's Kirk
Douglas partying at the Sonoma home of the Bay Area plastic surgeon Jack
Owsley and his wife, Sharon. Here's San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown
arriving by helicopter at the Sonoma retreat of philanthropists Gary and
O.J. Shansby. Multimillion-dollar villas now sprout from 160-acre
homesteads.</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Carpenter, a former county supervisor from the left-leaning
region around Sebastopol, says the acceleration became apparent by the
end of the 1990s: "All of a sudden we had a lot more millionaires and
dot-commers who were cashing in stock to buy property out here."</TE>
<TE>   Grapes and more grapes were planted, some for show and more for
profit; vineyard acreage in the county increased by 40% between 1996 and
2001. By the time tech crashed and the economy slipped, the wine country
had been thoroughly colonized by those who had cashed out early. Land
prices were up everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Travel into the county shot up by 50% a year in the late 1990s, from
about 4 million visitors in 1998 to 6 million in 2000, the last year for
which figures are available from the state Division of Tourism. Visitor
spending rose by nearly the same amount, to more than $850 million in
1999. County officials expect the figure to approach $1 billion for 2000.
Although at least two big hotel projects were beaten back, more than 500
hotel rooms were added last year, mostly catering to the business and
luxury markets. In spite of a post-Sept. 11 tourism slump, developers are
battling to add even more high-end hotel space.</TE>
<TE>   Now, for example, the owners of Napa Valley's Auberge du Soleil and
Mexico's Las Ventanas al Paraiso are vying to open $500-plus-a-night
resorts within a mile and a half of each other in the two-lane hamlet of
Kenwood. A third hotel, the Kenwood Inn and Spa, is adding 24 rooms to
its Tuscan-style compound, tripling its size. Yet another high-end inn
has been proposed in the small town of Glen Ellen. In the town of Sonoma,
the Sonoma Mission Inn &amp; Spa recently expanded, doubling the size of its
spa and adding 30 rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Artisan cheese makers are listed in visitor guides like tourist
attractions. Mary Matos, whose St. George cheese is made in a tiny
factory down a rutted road outside Santa Rosa, says she has had so many
visitors in the past couple of years that she's had to stop letting them
watch the milking--they were making her cows nervous.</TE>
<TE>   Most destinations would cheer such prospects on the heels of
recession--after all, many a local windfall has been reaped in the last
few years. But Sonoma County has a word for what's been happening, and
not everyone smiles when saying it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Napafication," says Carpenter, who came to the county from
Berkeley in the late 1960s. "I mean, so far we've maintained a balance,
but how much is too much?</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, we have the coast, the wineries, the Russian River. We have
bakeries like Seattle has coffee shops. Our bread is fantastic. But
people can't find parking spots in small towns, can't pull out onto their
main roads, and Highway 116 just slows to a crawl on weekends. At any one
time, there's probably a hundred wineries out of compliance with their
conditional-use permits, putting on weddings and froufrou events that
they aren't supposed to be doing. So much land has converted to vineyard
that you almost can't find enough apple blossoms in Sebastopol anymore
for the Sebastopol Apple Blossom Festival.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you the number of people who've told me in the last year
that Sonoma County has just gotten too big for 'em," Carpenter sighs. "A
lot of people are picking up and moving someplace else."</TE>
<TE>   Del Rydman would rather not become one of those people, but as a
homeowner, he isn't pleased. Rydman lives in Kenwood, an affluent
settlement of about 1,250 on the eastern edge of the county. Recently
retired from Agilent Technologies, the Hewlett-Packard spinoff that has
become one of the county's major employers, the financial analyst moved
to his three-acre ranchette 25 years ago so his daughter could have
horses. His low-slung white house sits at the end of a little dirt road,
past some mailboxes and a "Caution: Grandchildren at Play" sign. Five
acres of fragrant lavender hug his homestead. Beyond them sprawls the
magnificent Chateau St. Jean winery.</TE>
<TE>   "When we first moved here," he says, reaching down to pet a cat that
has leaped onto the hood of his 1995 Saturn, "you could go outside and
work on your property and you'd hear nothing--nothing!--but birds. This
was raw land with a spec house when we bought it. A house and a few prune
trees and land that went straight through. There were walnut orchards and
egg farms and cattle. We used to feed my son cow's milk fresh from the
Jersey--brought it home in big mayonnaise jars. The kids would ride
horses to Chateau St. Jean and through the grapes because there were no
fences--they could wander all around.</TE>
<TE>   "Then the walnut trees were pulled up and grapes went in. And pretty
soon everywhere you looked, more vines were popping up. The cattle land
went to grapes, and so did the ag land. There were three wineries here
when we moved in. Now we have 10 or 12."</TE>
<TE>   The vineyards are breathtaking. Highway 12--a two-lane blacktop that
runs like a ribbon through Kenwood--is flanked in either direction by
wildflower-strewn pastures, ancient oaks and long rows of gnarled vines.
The Mayacamas range overlooks them. The tasting rooms look like
haciendas, chateaux, plantations, Gothic castles. They're magical and
romantic--and irritating as hell, Rydman says.</TE>
<TE>   "On weekends, when the wineries have events, you can hear the music
thumping," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "During the harvest, the grape trucks come banging down the road,
night and day, clang-clangin' when they're empty. Every Saturday and
Sunday, 200 or 300 people come in here. Just trying to pull out onto the
main road is getting ticklish."</TE>
<TE>   This brings him to the topic that, of late, has consumed Kenwood. Call
it The Attack of the Four-Handed Massages and the Five-Star Meals. The
first volley came in under the radar. The Kenwood Inn and Spa--an
Italianate garden compound that opened in 1990 as a four-room villa and
expanded to 12 rooms six years later--had quietly gotten permission to
expand again, this time to 36 rose-strewn units. Lush, romantic and
extremely private, the $325-a-night units quickly developed a following
among Hollywood types and honeymooners. "It had gotten to the point where
we had a six- to nine-month waiting list," says Len Beatie, the resort
manager.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the second wave. Auberge Resorts, the development company
behind the San Ysidro Ranch near Santa Barbara and Auberge du Soleil in
the Napa Valley, bought a 183-acre chunk of pasture and woodland along
Highway 12, just north of town. The land, once part of a ranch, had been
zoned for a hotel and winery, but various problems had kept it tied up.
Mark Harmon, owner of Auberge Resorts, says he'd been scouring Sonoma
County for years, looking for a place to build a sister to Auberge du
Soleil, when he heard that the property was on the market.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the prettiest sites I've ever seen, beautiful and
pristine and just stunning," he says. Perfect, in his opinion, for
Campagna, a 50-room hotel, a 75-seat restaurant, a dozen or so hilltop
home sites, a spa, a market and a boutique winery. Rooms will go for $300
to $600 a night.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to grow vines, plant orchards, grow organic produce,"
Harmon says. "Then we'll feature those things in our restaurant and
country store. We'll bring in producers from all over the county. I can't
tell you how excited I am about this. We'll bring in a flagship chef--you
know, when we did that at Auberge du Soleil there was no French Laundry,
no Culinary Institute of America. And look at what has happened there."</TE>
<TE>   Fifty rooms is a modest size by hotel standards, and Harmon's project
might have progressed without objection if Paradise Resorts hadn't come
in on its heels with a plan to tuck 98 rooms into 24 vine-covered,
$500-to-$700-a-night country French villas in the wooded hills behind
Chateau St. Jean.</TE>
<TE>   The developers of Las Ventanas, as it has been named, run one of the
most luxurious and pricey resorts in Los Cabos--a beachfront hotel with
in-room telescopes for stargazing and rooms that go from $575 to upward
of $2,000 nightly. But Las Ventanas came with bad karma--the developers
had made a run at a larger project on city-owned land in the nearby town
of Sonoma and had been overwhelmingly voted down in 1999. Though the
project was trimmed by the time its backers found a potential site in
Kenwood, the community rose up when word leaked out that their neighbor's
bete noire was now sniffing around their backyard.</TE>
<TE>   "The [Campagna] project was out of town and out of sight, and nobody
had known that Kenwood Inn was expanding," Rydman says. "But Las Ventanas
is right in the middle of town." If all three projects were approved,
homeowners reasoned, Kenwood's hotel sector would jump from 12 rooms to
more than 180. Most homes in the area rely on well water and use septic
tanks for sanitation. What would become of their ground water? What would
the hotels do with all that sewage? And where would the employees live?
The cheapest home in the area, as of early March, was a two-bedroom fixer
in a cow pasture for nearly $400,000, and apartments are all but
nonexistent.</TE>
<TE>   "This place is pristine," Rydman says. "The reasons those hotels want
to be here are the reasons we don't want 'em. We organized a meeting in
December at the Kenwood fire station and almost 100 people showed up.
Everybody was against it. But we had them come in to make a presentation.
And they came in with their slide show and their statistics. Nine hundred
more cars on the road on weekdays. Fifteen hundred more cars on weekends.
A spa that would pull 46,000 gallons a day up out of our water table.
Three hundred employees to be bused in from Santa Rosa. Well, we all
listened very nicely. And then we said, 'Forget you.' "</TE>
<TE>   In fact, not everyone opposed Las Ventanas--or Campagna or the Kenwood
Inn expansion. Some, like John Moran, who owns a roadside antique shop,
doubted that the hotels would really intrude. Some, like Micheal Hudson,
were undecided, but questioned the opponents' motives. "Out here, there's
a lot of I-got-mine-and-I-don't-want-you-to-have-yours," says Hudson, a
contractor and captain of the volunteer fire department.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Rydman and his neighbors organized into committees, and
within four months had launched themselves as the nonprofit Valley of the
Moon Alliance, complete with a Web site. Since then, they have protested
the expansions, but the fight is uphill.</TE>
<TE>   Kenwood is unincorporated. Its planning decisions are made by five
county supervisors who govern an area roughly the size of Rhode Island.
Their most pressing problem is not, as alliance member Bill Hafner puts
it, "$700-a-night bubble baths jeopardizing the ground water," but a
severe countywide shortage of low-income housing, which in Sonoma County
is funded with a tax on hotel rooms.</TE>
<TE>   The Kenwood projects, if all were approved, would increase the number
of hotel rooms by a factor of 15. The Campagna people estimate an extra
$730,000 would flow into the public kitty just in its first year; Las
Ventanas figures it would pump out $68 million in bed taxes over the next
two decades, and has offered to front the county $2 million. Any housing
that would be subsidized would almost certainly be somewhere other than
Kenwood. To those not directly affected, the package sounds like a good
deal.</TE>
<TE>   "Those particular resort hotels come into the communities with a great
deal of class and sophistication and do such a good job," says Sharon
Owsley, who bought a weekend home four years ago in the town of Sonoma
after summering for 25 years in the Napa Valley. "I know there's always
the concern that it'll get too developed, but you have to have a
balance--"</TE>
<TE>   She catches herself and chuckles.</TE>
<TE>   "Watch," she says. "Now I'll probably be picketed."</TE>
<TE>   A lot of people might wonder how a place would be anything but tickled
at an influx of back rubs, room service, nice upper-class people and
chilled Chardonnay.</TE>
<TE>   But no season begins without another one ending. Carla Howell spent
eight years as a mayor and city councilwoman in Healdsburg, and several
years before that was a member of the Planning Commission. During the
1980s and 1990s, she was in on the groundwork for many of the changes now
coming to fruition: the sale of the old City Hall building to a developer
who installed the gourmet Oakville Grocery, the marketing of the town as
a Hollywood location for movies such as "Scream" and "Mumford," the
redevelopment of a vacant lot on the town plaza into the hip new Hotel
Healdsburg, the growth policies that preserved the city's
turn-of-the-century charm.</TE>
<TE>   Now 53 and retired from public office, Howell runs a children's
clothing boutique on Healdsburg's quaint central plaza. The downtown that
has developed is sophisticated and welcoming, filled with treats and
surprises. On weekends, delighted visitors from around the world peruse
the bookstores or stock up for wine country picnics. There's a
chocolatier and a bakery run by former Chez Panisse pastry chefs and a
deli with 39 varieties of olive oil just in the "extra-virgin" section.</TE>
<TE>   "What? They don't open until noon?" one New Yorker was overheard
fretting on a recent weekday outside Charlie Palmer's Dry Creek Kitchen.
It is heaven, if heaven were designed by Wine Spectator subscribers and
National Public Radio listeners.</TE>
<TE>   And Carla Howell has "very mixed feelings" about the way her town has
turned out.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the things I did were to maintain the character of our small
town," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "But in preserving the town, we made it this wonderful place that is
now extremely expensive. All the things I was trying to preserve for my
children might as well have gone by the wayside because my children can't
afford to live here anymore. I know the decisions were the right thing to
do at the time--what are you going to do? Have Kmarts and Wal-Marts? That
was our choice. Be Mart-ed up or get tarted up. We chose the tarts."</TE>
<TE>   But housing hasn't been the only aspect of life to be altered in the
New Healdsburg. Another practical effect, she says, has been a shortage
of stores that cater to locals as commercial rents have been bid up.
There has been, for example, no mainstream department store in Healdsburg
since JCPenney moved out some years ago. This is the source of the
no-underwear-in-town joke, which is actually false--you can, in fact,
find men's underwear in Healdsburg. You just have to know where. (Halfway
to the back of a store called Everywear that features sweaters in the
window. It has one very small rack.)</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest difference in town is the most subtle--the
commodification, for lack of a better word, of its authenticity. It is
perhaps the signature unintended consequence of the era, familiar to any
small place that has ever hit the big time--the Hamptons, the Berkshires,
the New England coastline, the--yes--Napa Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "On weekends, the whole town turns from cowboys and soccer moms into
something straight out of L.L.Bean or Eddie Bauer," Howell says in
amazement. "Just wall-to-wall khaki bermudas and guys with loafers and no
socks. The inside joke is that it's like we should all show up in dirndl
skirts and lederhosen, like 'Li'l Old Winemaker Me.' It's actually sort
of a hoot."</TE>
<TE>   Zinfandel virtuoso Dave Rafanelli, owner of A. Rafanelli Winery,
stopped letting people drop in for wine tastings three years ago for that
very reason. "There were 30, 40 people in here on weekends," he says as
his daughter Shelly stands in the cellar, pouring a glass of the 1999
vintage. "And they all wanted private conversation and personal
attention. They were lined up out the door. I felt like some kind of
attraction at Fisherman's Wharf."</TE>
<TE>   So he put up a locked gate and told tourists that they had to call
first for appointments. Did they listen? Rafanelli and his daughter
exchange mirthful glances.</TE>
<TE>   "Some woman just pulled in today," he says, "and when I asked if she'd
called first, she said, 'Oh, well, we were here last year and I memorized
your gate combination. Gee, you don't mind, do you?' "</TE>
<TE>   It is this--the understanding that Sonoma County's very heart is what
is yearned for--that residents seem to find most unsettling. There is the
suspicion that the tourists' hunger isn't just for good bread and fine
wine but for entree to a home they are altering, just by being there.
Every new face is another vote for a cleaner, classier, more
self-conscious Sonoma County, a citified Eden where the country doesn't
have bumpkins and the Sonoma lambs are invisibly slaughtered and the li'l
old winemakers welcome (upscale) trespassers. Yes, it's progress, locals
say, but at what price?</TE>
<TE>   "Is it worth it," Howell asks, "if you become a curiosity in your own
town?"</TE>
<TE>   Campbell, the sheep rancher, offers a more pragmatic, and perhaps
larger, viewpoint.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a flow here," he says. "The good side of it, at the moment,
is that these people who want to come in are the people who can afford my
neighbors' $100 bottles of wine and my lamb."</TE>
<TE>   He clambers down from his pickup. We have come to his destination, a
farm with sweet, green volunteer wheat rippling around us in every
direction. It is another county, not Sonoma, and I will not name it
because it is Sonoma before  Sonoma got discovered, paradise before the
appetites of man.</TE>

<HD>Dining in Sonoma: A Work in Progress</HD>
<DH>The Restaurants and Food  Shops Are Better Than Ever, but That's
Not to Say They've Arrived</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With its roster of old wine families and new millionaire winery
owners, Napa Valley is practically a brand name for the California wine
country lifestyle. Brash and publicity savvy, Napa had all but eclipsed
its more retiring neighbor, Sonoma County, which until recently had but
one "luxury" hotel and restaurants that were more local hangouts than
destinations for visitors.</LD>
<LD>   Not so anymore. In recent years, Sonoma has added a few elegant
country inns, such as Gaige House Inn in Glen Ellen and Farmhouse Inn and
Restaurant in Forestville. Healdsburg, once a charmingly retro little
town at the hub of the wine country, now has two boutique hotels with
great style and comfort, the Duchamp (named after surrealist Marcel
Duchamp) and the new luxury Hotel Healdsburg. Las Ventanas in Cabo San
Lucas has plans to open a resort near Kenwood.</LD>
<LD>   It's all quite a change from the days when the choices were limited to
the rather grand Sonoma Mission Inn &amp; Spa, nondescript motels or fussy
bed and breakfasts where you were likely to find teddy bears in your bed
and baked brie for breakfast.</LD>
<TE>   Day spas--surely a sign that the narcissistic well-heeled are
nearby--are sprouting up all over Sonoma. The county also has a growing
list of home-grown restaurants and "have knife, will travel" types who
migrated from big city restaurants to open their own in the Sonoma wine
country.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, I'm not wild about losing the old Sonoma to the "wine
country lifestyle," with all its rampant hype and commercialism. If
you've experienced Sonoma's better known neighbor at the height of
summer, when cars are bunched tighter than grapes along Highway 29 and
the Silverado Trail, Sonoma wine country is bliss. It's hard to imagine
how to improve on the experience of looking at the big blue sky over
Sonoma's Alexander Valley, with cotton candy clouds hovering just above
the gentle hills and rows of well-behaved vines following the contours of
the land, a riot of yellow mustard in flower at their feet. The valley's
narrow road makes lazy swoops past farmhouses and wineries that look like
what they are, not postmodern fantasies or tricked-up faux French
chateaux.</TE>
<TE>   Sonoma's little farms supply the Bay Area (and Napa Valley) with
everything from gorgeous produce, herbs and exotic greens to tender lamb,
suckling pig and free-range poultry, along with luscious stone fruits and
heirloom apples. Yet with all this bounty, Sonoma restaurants have never
quite lived up to their potential. Few are at the level of top
restaurants in the Napa Valley. You can't find the equivalent of the
French Laundry or even Pinot Blanc, Joachim Splichal's St. Helena
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   That said, there is a new energy in Sonoma, and more choices than ever
before.</TE>
<TE>   Once-sleepy Healdsburg is emblematic. It's now hordes of well-dressed
people strolling around-- and around--the plaza. Yes, I did catch the
Porsche or two rumbling at the stoplight. But the town hasn't given in
entirely to tourists. Mixed in with the gaudy stores selling grape
tchotchkes is Toyon Books, a wonderful local store run by passionate book
lovers, a fabric shop where local quilters congregate, and a coffee
roaster.</TE>
<TE>   The best argument for staying in Healdsburg is the Downtown Bakery &amp;
Creamery. Founded by Lindsey Shere, then the Chez Panisse pastry chef,
and Kathleen Stewart, who is now the sole owner, the old-fashioned
country bakery makes the best sticky buns on the planet. Freckled with
cinnamon, the tender yeast dough is robed in a buttery burnt sugar
caramel. If you stay at the Duchamp Hotel, they come as part of the
complimentary breakfast on Sundays. Or sneak down from your room at Hotel
Healdsburg and across the square to nab some still warm from the oven.</TE>
<TE>   The bakery has a wonderful down-to-earth aesthetic. It hasn't been
gussied up to fit some magazine stylist's idea of what the wine country
should be. All the artistry goes into the breads and pastries themselves.
Taste polenta pear tart, fabulous eclairs, handcrafted breads and pies
featuring local fruit. In the summer, stop in for some of the
fresh-churned ice creams made from Sonoma County eggs and cream. There's
also an open-face apple galette with a short, crumbly crust and
sweet-tart Sierra Beauty apples that have been cooked down to almost an
applesauce.</TE>
<TE>   Oakville Grocery saw Sonoma's potential long ago and has had an
outpost in Healdsburg for several years. The shop is bursting with
enticing foodstuffs for the pantry, and its deli counter puts out an
attractive spread of fresh salads, roasted meats, sandwiches and most
everything for a wine country picnic.</TE>
<TE>   The former cheese buyer there, Susan Walrabenstein, has opened her own
shop just off the plaza. The Cheese Course is as serious as cheese shops
come, but you'd never know it from the window display. Inside her cool,
spacious storefront is a small but beguiling selection of local and
imported cheeses compiled by someone absolutely passionate about the
subject. Display some curiosity and she'll cut into a handsome Montgomery
cheddar from London's famed Neal's Yard, or she'll give you a taste of
Cashel blue, a marvelous, creamy cheese from Ireland. I love the sheep's
milk ricotta from local Bellwether Farms. While you're there, pick up
some of the fragrant fried almonds from Spain, gray French sea salt (sold
by the ounce), or a bag of organic carnaroli rice from Piedmont. The
Cheese Course is a treasure, one that I wish I had in my neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in May, the Saturday morning Healdsburg Farmers Market (along
with the Santa Rosa and other Sonoma County farmers markets) showcases
local farmers. It can be agonizing for a visiting cook without a kitchen
to see blue-green Araucanian chicken eggs with their deep gold yolks;
fat, pale gold Queen Anne cherries; delicate wild strawberries; heirloom
tomatoes in a rainbow of colors; tender little lettuces; and chalky goat
and sheep's milk cheeses.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sonoma farms supply many ingredients synonymous with
California cuisine, until recently local chefs haven't always known how
to exploit the bounty. Enter Charlie Palmer, the New York chef behind
Aureole in Manhattan and Las Vegas (at the latter, wine "angels" rappel
down ropes to fetch bottles from a 42-foot glass wine tower) and a clutch
of other New York restaurants and catering operations. For this ambitious
chef, Sonoma's wine country must have been hard to resist.</TE>
<TE>   A partner in the new Hotel Healdsburg, Palmer has moved into the wine
country with the 66-seat Dry Creek Kitchen adjoining the hotel. With its
large French doors commanding one corner of a historic plaza, Dry Creek
Kitchen doesn't resemble any other restaurant in either Sonoma--or Napa.
It looks like a big-city venue plopped in a sleepy cow town. Its design
is sleek and contemporary, more Christian Liaigre than Ralph Lauren
country. The appointments are handsome--chairs covered in a pear-print
linen, studied flower arrangements, and a long harvest table in the
middle of the room. The frosted glass wall between the kitchen and the
dining room, though, reveals things that should be hidden: bulky electric
slicers, rolls of Saran Wrap, industrial restaurant equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The service at Dry Creek Kitchen may be the best in Sonoma County.
What matters most, though, is the quality of the cooking. At dinner on a
first visit, dishes seemed heavy, weighed down with intense reductions
and too many ingredients, and not at all wine-friendly. The food has a
big-city bluster that doesn't suit the setting. Take the amuse gueule, an
espresso cup with a half-inch of onion and white truffle panna cotta.
It's oddly sweet and quite awful. Flash-cooked calamari dressed with
McEvoy olio nuovo is utterly bland, too sparing of the fabulously
expensive Marin County olive oil. Steamboat oysters on the half shell
come with wonderful house-made crackers shot through with black pepper,
but the oysters aren't chilled enough and the Pinot Blanc mignonette
tastes too much of sharp vinegar. Sauteed Sonoma foie gras with brioche
beignets is unacceptably stringy, a sorry example of what should be
glorious fattened duck liver.</TE>
<TE>   Dishes pick up a little with the main courses, especially with a
slow-roasted beef tenderloin. Salmon is fine, though it's hard to
distinguish the flavor of its black truffle chestnut crust. It comes with
a dreamy accompaniment of celery root puree and soft buttery ribbons of
cabbage. Cassoulet is dreadful, however, except for the delicious nuggets
of blood sausage. The elements taste more assembled than melded together
over hours of slow cooking. It's topped with a syrupy brown sauce--I can
only wonder why.</TE>
<TE>   Lunch for two was much more pleasant. Dishes tend to be lighter, for
one thing. I enjoyed a frisee salad scattered with diced smoked trout on
a horseradish cream. It's paired with a crumbly scallion biscuit with a
smear of salmon mousse (the mousse had gone slightly off, however). A
pungent, silken green garlic soup decorated with a swatch of
"microgreens" and a swirl of green olive oil is pleasing, and an organic
chicken breast tucked under a fluffy comforter of basil is moist and
delicious. The prettiest dish is polenta-crusted salmon surrounded by pea
shoots, English peas and both white and violet pearl onions. Now that's
more like wine country cuisine.</TE>
<TE>   As you'd expect, Dry Creek Kitchen's wine list is exhaustive and
expensive. But if you pick up some interesting bottles on your forays
through the wine country, the wine policy here is favorable, with no
corkage fee for Sonoma wines.</TE>
<TE>   Just down the street is the year-old Manzanita, opened by the former
owners of Willowside, which was a wonderful roadside restaurant outside
Santa Rosa. Casual and appealing, Manzanita is in a rustic old building
with high ceilings and a wood-burning oven. It takes its name from the
stacks of manzanita logs that divide the dining area from the bar. Lush,
romantic landscapes by painter Wade Hoefer add atmosphere to an otherwise
stark room. The wine list is fairly priced, truly interesting and
eclectic--just what you hope to find in the wine country. Be sure to ask
to see both the regular and the reserve lists, which is where you find
some real treasures. They've got exquisite oysters on the half shell to
accompany a Raveneau Chablis we ferreted out on the list. Pizzas from the
wood-burning oven are terrific, with toppings that make sense.</TE>
<TE>   Manzanita chef Bruce Frieseke turns out rustic orecchiette ("little
ears" pasta) with earthy mustard greens, wild mushrooms and tangy ricotta
salata (salted ricotta). Wine-braised beef short ribs are so popular that
they were gone by the time we ordered, but roasted quail with apple
smoked bacon and spring onions paired with a piquillo pepper frittata
beckoned instead. Who could resist the rhubarb upside-down cake with both
strawberry and mascarpone sorbets?</TE>
<TE>   Not many of the wine country restaurants offer lunch, but Healdsburg
has a couple of choice spots. I like Ravenette, the minuscule cafe next
to the Raven theater (another must stop for its small-town ambience). It
has only eight or so tables, so it's essential to reserve ahead. I loved
a salad of roasted Yukon potatoes and frisee with grilled artichokes. The
must-have is the Ravenous Burger with Jack cheese and thick-cut fries,
but they also make the best ham sandwich around. It's a heap of thinly
sliced smoked ham from Niman Ranch and a mild sheep's milk cheese on good
country bread spread with Dijon mustard. Drink a glass of Ridge "Coast
Range" Zin. Desserts are not to be missed either. At dinner, the
restaurant moves around the corner to Ravenous, though my one meal there
was disappointing. It could have been an off night.</TE>
<TE>   The other local favorite for lunch (and dinner, too) is Bistro Ralph,
named for owner Ralph Tingle, who came from the Bay Area to open this hip
little bistro 10 years ago. Tables are covered in butcher paper and
napkins are laid out like place mats along the bar, where skinny metal
trays display lovely vegetable still lifes. Try the fried calamari with
Szechuan dipping sauce. Split the Caesar, which is plenty for two. It
looks like the one they used to do at 4th Street Grill in Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Tingle's mother, Alta, founded the famed indoor-outdoor shop The
Gardener in Berkeley. Now she has a second shop in Healdsburg, where she
has a weekend house. No wine country junk here. Instead there's lots to
covet, namely the gorgeous terra-cotta pots from Tuscany, jewel-toned
tiles from Canadian artist Xenia Taler and an assortment of rustic
ceramics from the south of France and local potters.</TE>
<TE>   A former Bistro Ralph chef, Steve Litke is now cooking at Farmhouse
Inn and Restaurant in Forestville. The property was recently bought by
Catherine Bartolomei and her brother Joe. The two come from a
fourth-generation vineyard family in the Russian River Valley and they've
decorated the walls of the restaurant with black-and-white snapshots of
family picnics and events in the Sonoma of the 1920s and '30s. The yellow
dining room welcomes visitors with a fire and candles on the tables.</TE>
<TE>   The Farmhouse menu is short and sweet and changes almost daily. The
one item that's always included is "rabbit, rabbit, rabbit." It's a trio
of roasted loin wrapped in applewood-smoked bacon, roasted rack of rabbit
and rabbit confit in a whole-grain mustard sauce with fingerling
potatoes. It's delicious. The chef makes a mean ravioli, too. The one I
had was as slender as pea pods and filled with fava beans and mascarpone.
To celebrate the beginning of asparagus season, he prepared a Parmesan
flan with spring asparagus and a peppery wild watercress salad. Sonoma
lamb appears in thick chops with with a medley of spring vegetables that
taste fresh-picked.</TE>
<TE>   The advantage of staying in Healdsburg is that it's the hub that links
the Alexander, Dry Creek and Russian River valleys and their wineries.
They're all beautiful drives, unspoiled and dreamlike. Westside Road,
which winds from Healdsburg along the Russian River to Guerneville and
the Russian River resorts, is popular for biking and dawdling at wine
estates, such as Williams-Selyem, Rochioli and Porter Creek. It also is
home to the Antique Apple Nursery and Middleton Farm, an organic garden
just off the road.</TE>
<TE>   Turning into the road, I saw a tall figure in a baseball cap digging
in the soil.  It was 72-year-old Nancy Skall, who gardens and sells her
irresistible organic produce and homemade jams out of her barn. (You'll
also find her at the Healdsburg Farmers Market and, in winter, the Santa
Rosa Farmers Market). I covet her garlic and tomatoes, her Queen Anne
cherries and a strawberry so luscious she keeps the variety a secret.</TE>
<TE>   She's the one who told me about a new restaurant, K &amp; L Bistro in
downtown Sebastopol, that buys produce from her. I only had time for
lunch, and I wish I could have gone back for dinner. It's owned by two
chefs, Karen and Lucas Martin, who met when they were both cooking at
Hayes Street Grill in San Francisco. (Lucas worked there off and on for
eight years, and also at Jardiniere and Rubicon in San Francisco.) As
soon as we walked into the simple storefront decorated with banquettes
and bistro chairs, we caught a whiff of something delicious. The soup of
the day was a lovely celery root puree decorated with a few tender celery
leaves. The frisee salad with Hobbs applewood-smoked bacon and a gorgeous
saffron-yolk poached egg is the best version of this classic French salad
I've had in this country.</TE>
<TE>   Who could resist the housemade boudin blanc, a fat sausage of pork,
chicken and cream with a delicate texture? It comes with fabulous
deep-gold fries. To achieve that incredibly crunchy exterior, they're
double-fried, and worth a detour all on their own. The sausages also come
with a wonderful salad of raw sliced apple with shredded radicchio. For
dessert, check out the espresso cookies with ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   For breakfast, head to Willow Wood Market Cafe in the minuscule town
of Graton, which is not so tiny that it doesn't have a decent bookstore
on its two blocks. Willow Wood Market isn't much of a market, really.
They sell some wines and upscale food products, along with cold drinks.
At breakfast the kitchen turns out gilded French toast made with challah
and served with toasted walnuts and maple syrup. They've got homemade
granola, too, and sides such as Black Forest ham and, oddly, grilled
coppa. Sunday brunch (served until 3 p.m.) adds fancier items such as
eggs Benedict and huevos rancheros made with Manchego cheese. Bring the
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Jack London figures prominently in the history of Valley of the Moon
and Glen Ellen, a few miles outside the town of Sonoma. You can visit the
remains of London's Wolf House, which burned in 1913 just before he and
his bride planned to move in. I checked into Gaige House Inn in Glen
Ellen with the idea of going to Mucca for dinner. But the restaurant,
sister to San Francisco and Venice Beach's Globe, had suffered a fire two
nights before. They hope to reopen, but because the restaurant is in a
landmark barn, getting permits to rebuild is complicated.</TE>
<TE>   We ended up driving into Sonoma for dinner at "the girl &amp; the fig"
(yes, lower case), which moved from Glen Ellen to Sonoma Plaza a year
ago. Downstairs from The Sonoma Hotel, it's relaxed and unpretentious and
known for its wine list, which focuses on Rhone varietals. It's a
comfortable place with an immense bar on one side that was brought from
the East Coast in the 1920s. The food is more or less country
French--mussels steamed in garlic and Pernod, crab cakes with a pretty
celery root and beet salad, charcuterie and cheese platters. For main
courses, there is Liberty duck confit, which could have been crisper,
steak frites and a grilled pork chop in a fig glaze. For dessert there's
a demure chocolate pot de creme and profiteroles with vanilla ice cream
and a bittersweet chocolate sauce. During the tourist season, they're
open late when many places aren't.</TE>
<TE>   For all its charm, the town of Sonoma is taking on some of Napa
Valley's least appealing aspects. Shops on the plaza cater mainly to
tourists. Except for the simple rooms at The Sonoma Hotel on the square,
hotels are mostly overpriced. I checked into the newish Lodge at Sonoma,
which turned out to be across from the tacky Train Town. Its "luxury
cottages" sat, unadorned, in basically a parking lot. My room had the
scintillating view of the housing development across the street, a creepy
polyester coverlet and a heating system that sounded like a washing
machine. At more than $200 on a weekend night, I reconsidered and checked
out, spending the night in a motel instead.</TE>
<TE>   I was in Sonoma to eat at Cafe La Haye. But to add insult to injury,
when I called to see if we could expand our dinner reservation from two
to five, my husband was told that his voice sounded suspiciously like
someone who had called earlier desperate to get a reservation, and that
he showed no reservation in our name. If we wanted to eat at the bar,
he'd save us a place if we came at 6 p.m. No, thank you. I thought I'd at
least go for brunch the next day, but they didn't take reservations for
brunch. And that's how I never went to Cafe La Haye.</TE>
<TE>   I went to Sonoma expecting to find its restaurants blooming, something
that hasn't come true, yet. Mariposa, which I thought was terrific, was
sold between my first and second visits and is moving to San Francisco.
It's not the only promising restaurant to beat a retreat: Freestyle, a
restaurant opened by Drew Nieporent, one of the owners of Rubicon, closed
after a year and a half. Yet that aside, the county has more life, more
openings, more energy. It may be two steps forward, one step back, but
something good is happening in this wine country paradise.</TE>

Story," by Joseph Wambaugh. Copyright 2002 by Joseph Wambaugh. To be
published April 30 by William Morrow and Co., an imprint of HarperCollins
Publishers. Reprinted by permission.</LD>
<TE>PROLOGUE</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until this past January that, with one final DNA test, Los
Angeles finally closed the book on a unique criminal investigation and
prosecution. This massive inquiry involved John Orr, whom a U.S.
government serial-arson profiler at the FBI's National Center for the
Analysis of Violent Crimes had dubbed "probably the most prolific
American arsonist of the 20th century."</TE>
<TE>   California arson investigators would concur that this case was like
nothing seen before, transforming the methods of those who scan fire
scenes for that elusive "point of origin." Arson sleuths were forced to
consider possibilities that had seemed unthinkable prior to an
unprecedented series of incendiary fires that blazed across Central and
Southern California for many years and ended with Orr's arrest in 1991.
When it all began is anyone's guess, but the flames would never be damped
for those who had been psychically seared by the inferno.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps an arbitrary point of origin for this story might be found in
the quiet suburb of South Pasadena, on the evening of Oct. 10, 1984,
during the World Series.</TE>
<TE>CHAPTER 1 CALAMITY</TE>
<TE>   South Pasadena is a small city of some 20,000 residents who live
within three square miles of mostly aging homes and limited commercial
property. Many of the houses were built in the 1920s, the heyday of
California Mission-style architecture, before the Great Depression
stifled home building. Neighboring Pasadena, host to the famous Rose
Parade, continued building luxury homes well into the 1930s, some of them
gems of California style, all in need of periodic renovation. A good
place for homeowners to buy materials to refurbish those old houses was
at Ole's Home Center on Fair Oaks Avenue, an 18,000-square-foot building
in a strip mall, three blocks from the town's only fire station.</TE>
<TE>   At 7:30 p.m. that October evening, Billy and Ada Deal and their 2
1/2-year-old grandson, Matthew William Troidl, arrived in Ole's parking
lot. Matthew immediately spotted the neighboring Baskin-Robbins and
wanted ice cream. His grandfather promised him they would have their
treat after they finished shopping, and they walked through the entry
door.</TE>
<TE>   Working in the housewares department that evening was 17-year-old
Jimmy Cetina. He was a high school senior and a talented athlete. In
fact, this varsity center fielder was being scouted by the Chicago Cubs
to play double-A ball. He had Latino good looks and had recently entered
a Bullock's department store modeling competition, and won it.</TE>
<TE>   Doubtlessly, he would rather have been some other place than at Ole's
Home Center on that October evening, especially during the World Series,
but there were seven children in his family who had to look for empty
bottles and cans to exchange for deposits if they wanted to buy sports
equipment. He needed this job.</TE>
<TE>   Billy and Ada Deal knew that the near-empty store was about to close
so they decided to split up and shop separately to save time. Billy
wanted to buy some cheap two-by-fours, so he headed for the lumber
display between the north and south interior fire doors. Ada said she was
going to the paint department.</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn Krause was working in the paint department that evening, so
she may well have seen the 50-year-old grandmother pushing her grandson
Matthew William in a shopping cart. Carolyn Krause was married to an LAPD
lieutenant and had two young children of her own. She may have heard
Matthew asking when he was going to get his ice cream. And someone else
who was in that store may have heard him, too. Or perhaps not. This issue
would be later debated in courts of law.</TE>
<TE>   It had been a long shift for Jim Obdam. The young clerk had been
working in the hardware department all day and into the evening. Just
after 8 p.m. he heard something over the public-address system, but
couldn't make out what had been said. He was headed for the front of the
store, toward the south aisle, and there he was astonished to see a
column of dark smoke rising from a display rack, all the way to the
ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   Obdam hurried toward the west end of the store, looking for customers.
He saw people heading toward the exits, but still was not alarmed when he
arrived at the paint department.</TE>
<TE>   "Are there any more people in your section?" he asked Krause.</TE>
<TE>   She answered, "I'll check my area!" And then she rushed through the
department looking for stragglers.</TE>
<TE>   Still, nobody was alarmed. Nobody had seen any fire, just that column
of dark smoke. In fact, Obdam found two people browsing in hardware,
looking at tools. He told them to leave the store at once.</TE>
<TE>   And then he encountered a middle-aged woman with a small child in a
shopping cart. Ada Deal was looking at merchandise on an end cap at the
foot of the aisle. "We've got to leave the store," Obdam told her. "But
don't be alarmed."</TE>
<TE>   Ada put some merchandise into the cart behind her grandson. Obdam
hurried down the north aisle toward the main part of the store, but when
he looked around, Ada hadn't followed, so he went back.</TE>
<TE>   "You should probably leave the cart here," he said, more forcefully.
"Take the child and let's go!"</TE>
<TE>   And then he headed toward the front of the store, assuming that Ada
and her grandson were following behind him. He was near the north fire
door, about two aisles away when he looked back toward that column of
smoke. But it was no longer a cloud. It was a wall of flame. It was
bright orange and raging. Then he noticed the north fire door had closed.
That steel door had dropped down.</TE>
<TE>   When he turned to look for the woman and child he heard a popping
noise and the lights went out. And Obdam suddenly felt alone and trapped.</TE>
<TE>   A bell chimed in the lumber area: "ting ting ting." that's how Billy
Deal described it. And there was an unintelligible announcement. He
thought that the store was closing so he looked at his watch. It was 8:05
p.m. Yes, it must be a closing announcement, he thought. But then a
peculiar thing happened. A young man on a forklift jumped off the vehicle
and cried, "My God, it's a fire!" And he took off running.</TE>
<TE>   Billy looked around. He couldn't see what the young man was getting
excited about. There was nothing. But suddenly some people ran through
the fire door and yelled, "Get outta here! There's a fire!"</TE>
<TE>   Billy peered through that door, that fireproof barricade toward the
west side of the store, and he saw a big cloud of smoke in the center of
the space. He ran toward the south fire door searching for Ada and
Matthew, and when he got there the cloud behind him had turned into a
wall, a wall of very black smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Deal screamed, "Ada!"</TE>
<TE>   He ran toward the entrance doors that he and his wife and grandson had
passed through a half hour before, and saw that a fire engine was
arriving.</TE>
<TE>   In the darkness, Jim Obdam battled panic. He was all alone in the
smoke and heat. He knew there were steps to an emergency exit in the back
stock room. He couldn't see, and hoped he could feel the steps, but his
thoughts were fragmenting, and he began praying. Then he remembered a
fire exit in the hardware department in the far northwest corner, if he
could only find the far northwest corner.</TE>
<TE>   He staggered to the back wall and duck-walked his way along, feeling
the wall and feeling merchandise, feeling anything to guide him. He was
holding his breath, low to the floor, and he dropped even lower,
desperate for the same oxygen that the fire craved. He was just about to
give up. He couldn't go any farther. When he suddenly realized he was six
feet from the emergency exit, he felt an energy rush and he lunged,
pushing the bars, activating the alarm. And he was out.</TE>
<TE>   But though the hungry flames couldn't reach him, the trailing heat
did. He was outside, but he felt as though he were still inside. It was
hot and he was burning. Obdam, covered head to foot with soot, ran toward
the front of the store, anxious to call his parents to tell them he was
all right, but when he touched his hand to his burning wrist, the flesh
fell off onto the pavement.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Colantuano, an employee in the electrical department, had been
at his workbench at 8:04 p.m. when a voice screamed, "Fire!" He spotted a
fellow employee and a few customers rushing down an aisle toward the
south fire door and he stopped them, herding them toward the fire exit in
the electrical department.</TE>
<TE>   "Come with me!" he yelled. "The door is over here!"</TE>
<TE>   As they exited the store, he looked back and it was like wading
through surf when a mountainous breaker is roiling toward you. But this
wave was made of fire. It was heaving and cresting and roaring.</TE>
<TE>   When he later described it, he said, "It was coming, coming fast
toward us. The flame. The fire. Everything."</TE>
<TE>   They were literally blown outside by a flashover--the instant burn of
gases and smoke, when the carbon that is smoke burns hotter than 1,000
degrees and the contents of a room erupt in flame and no living thing
survives. People, smoke, flames, merchandise, everything, was blasted
through the door into the cool autumn night.</TE>
<TE>   The six men of Engine Co. 81 had been just settling in front of the
TV, waiting for the start of the World Series game between the San Diego
Padres and Detroit Tigers, when they heard the police dispatch a
"possible 904," the police term for a fire. They were still sliding the
pole when the alarm bell went off and they figured it was more than a
"possible."</TE>
<TE>   Since Ole's Home Center was only three blocks from the station, the
fire company arrived in a few minutes. The fire captain in charge,
William Eisele, didn't think there'd be much to this one. There was no
glow or header of smoke above the roof line indicating a major structure
fire. All he saw was some haze in the air. He thought it might be a
dumpster or maybe a vehicle fire.</TE>
<TE>   But when the firefighters leaped from their engine, Eisele saw flames
rolling out the southwest door. When he got close to that door, the fire
actually hissed at him. The flames emitted very little smoke and had a
bluish-green tint from the merchandise--polyurethane foam, they would
later learn--that produced a strange sound, the hissing.</TE>
<TE>   The firefighters prepared to attack those flames, only three feet off
the floor but lapping out the door, hungry for oxygen, lunging against
the overhanging facade, climbing up.</TE>
<TE>   Never in his 54 years had Billy Deal been so thirsty. he was parched.
"Just like I was in a desert," he would later say.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Ada and Matthew had gotten out some other way, he kept telling
himself. He actually made an attempt to enter the building again before
being driven back. Then he joined the gathering crowd of onlookers as
neighboring engine companies neared, honking and wailing. He spotted
young Jim Obdam, carbon covered, running in front of the store toward
other huddled employees in the parking lot who shouted to him, overjoyed
to see him alive. And Billy thought, well, he got out, didn't he? Maybe
Ada and Matthew did too. Maybe. Billy ran to the fire captain and cried
out that he had escaped but his wife and grandson were trapped, maybe
only 10 feet inside the door.</TE>
<TE>   Eisele later reported that he had all the confidence in the world that
if somebody was only 10 feet inside that door he could go in and get them
out, so he said to Billy, "Don't worry, we'll take care of that!"</TE>
<TE>   Eisele gathered his firefighters for a rescue attack. He ordered that
they pull three folds of 2 1/2-inch hose, each fold being 50 feet long,
in a try to make a quick knockdown and rescue. They charged the line with
water and made their approach.</TE>
<TE>   The fog nozzle was like a giant shower head designed to break up water
particles and consume BTUs, drawing the heat from a fire. Because fire
needs oxygen, heat and fuel to survive, the fog nozzle was meant to
disrupt the fire triangle by turning heat into steam, in effect, shooting
steam at the fire to lower the temperature. It was all logical, very
logical.</TE>
<TE>   So after sending his sixth firefighter to find and shut down
utilities, especially natural gas, the captain and his men entered
through the southwest door, where suddenly they were looking into a
blinding orange inferno.</TE>
<TE>   They tried to attack under those flames, vivid orange but with a weird
blue-green tint, but they only got a few feet inside. The fire had
obviously flashed over. There were no aisles, there were no people, there
was nothing but fire. Everything was aflame. But now came an eerie sound
commingled with the hiss of the burning foam. The battery-powered display
smoke detectors were going off, one after another. And the firefighters
could hear high-pitched squeals within the flames, like animals burning
alive.</TE>
<TE>   Eisele yelled at the nozzle man to hit the Celotex ceiling tiles, but
the 225-gallon nozzle created so much steam in the super-heated air,
emitted so much nozzle pressure, that it blasted the firefighters back
out the door.</TE>
<TE>   While other engines were still racing to Ole's Home Center, Eisele
ordered a 1 3/4-inch attack line to be brought to another entry, but
learned that the fire doors had in fact rolled down and could not be
pried open. The captain sent a man up to ventilate the roof because the
fire had not burned through yet. When the firefighter cut the hole,
flames shot into the sky, pulling heat with them in a chimney effect, but
it was too little, too late. It was about seven minutes into the fire and
the entire roof was perilously threatened, so Eisele had to order his
firefighter back down.</TE>
<TE>   And where in the hell was Engine 41, he wondered, yelling into the
radio. And why did he hear an engine being radio-dispatched in the wrong
direction?</TE>
<TE>   What Eisele didn't know at the time was that there was another, nearly
simultaneous fire at Vons Market, only blocks from Ole's Home Center. He
would later say that it was unheard of: two South Pasadena fires in close
proximity? In retail establishments, during business hours? Unheard of!</TE>
<TE>   It was indeed a bizarre evening for firefighters in that part of the
San Gabriel Valley. Prior to the Ole's fire, and the fire at Vons, there
had been a fire in nearby Pasadena, at Albertson's Market on East Sierra
Madre Boulevard, about seven miles from Ole's. Arson investigator Scott
McClure had arrived at Albertson's at 6:45 p.m. and met with a battalion
chief for a quick briefing.</TE>
<TE>   McClure had found the point of origin easily enough, in the grocery
racks piled high with bags of potato chips. At 7:45 p.m. McClure called
dispatch and requested that they send arson investigator John Orr from
the nearby Glendale Fire Department, probably the most accomplished arson
sleuth within the several fire departments that rendered mutual aid in
the area.</TE>
<TE>   Orr showed up very quickly, and he explained to McClure about the
volatility of potato chips, that the oils in the chips and the bag
material are highly combustible, a sack of solid fuel. Orr told McClure
that in his opinion, the Albertson's fire was deliberately set, as is
usually the case with fires in retail stores during business hours when
customers are present. When McClure later finished his investigation and
returned to his car, he heard radio reports of the disaster that was
unfolding seven miles away at Ole's Home Center, and he sped toward the
scene.</TE>
<TE>   When he arrived at Ole's, Orr was already there.</TE>
<TE>   After he'd ordered his firefighter off the roof of Ole's, and after
the interior attack was aborted, Eisele found Orr standing at the rear of
his engine carrying a 35-millimeter camera.</TE>
<TE>   "John! What're you doing here?" Eisele asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Passing by," Orr said. "Do you mind if I shoot some pictures?"</TE>
<TE>   Eisele was wishing that Orr had turnout gear in his car, but since the
arson investigator was in civilian clothes and hadn't offered to help,
the fire captain assumed he did not. "Help yourself, I've got work to
do," Eisele said.</TE>
<TE>   And while Eisele awaited the arrival of engine companies, and while
Jim Obdam was led to the back of an ambulance, and while Billy Deal stood
in front of Ole's Home Center where he would remain for 22 hours, and
while John Orr shot film of the conflagration, the roof caved in and a
geyser of flame and sparks exploded high into the night.</TE>
<TE>   In the parking lot of Ole's, the sister-in-law of Carolyn Krause, who
was a community service officer for the Glendale Police Department, saw a
blue Dodge that belonged to the Glendale arson unit, and standing by the
car were Orr and his partner, Police Officer Dennis Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   After checking in vain at the triage area for her sister-in-law, Karen
Krause approached the arson investigators and told them that Carolyn
Krause was missing.</TE>
<TE>   Orr told her that they would keep an eye out for Carolyn, but until
the fire was suppressed nobody could get near the building except the
firefighters--the implication being that a search for bodies would be
hours away.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Krause stayed as the rest of the family arrived, and they
remained for several hours. Waiting.</TE>
<TE>   The fire chief of South Pasadena was at a fire prevention class in Los
Angeles when he learned of the disaster at Ole's. Chief Gene Murry
excused himself, jumped in his staff car and sped to South Pasadena,
arriving close to 8:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Murry spotted Orr snapping photos and asked if he would assist by
going to Vons to conduct an investigation. It wouldn't be until midnight
that the fire chief could declare that 125 firefighters had the Ole's
blaze under control.</TE>
<TE>   Moments before the smoke was observed in the housewares department,
Patricia Parham, mother of Carolyn Krause, had been at Ole's Home Center
to see her only daughter. Patricia Parham had with her Carolyn's two
children: her son, age 3, and her 2-year-old daughter. Patricia picked up
her daughter's house keys so that she could take the grandchildren home
and put them to bed.</TE>
<TE>   Back at Carolyn's house, Patricia received three phone calls in quick
succession--one from Carolyn's father-in-law, one from Carolyn's
sister-in-law and one from Carolyn's brother. When Patricia raced back to
the Ole's parking lot, the building was engulfed, and she never saw her
daughter again.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime after 8 p.m. the phone rang in the Cetina residence. Luis,
Jimmy's older brother, picked it up and a family friend said, "How's your
brother? Is he home?"</TE>
<TE>   She seemed upset, so Luis said, "Why?"</TE>
<TE>   And she said, "Because there's a fire where he works."</TE>
<TE>   Luis' mother asked him in Spanish what was wrong, but Luis answered,
"Nothing." Then he ran out to his car and drove to Ole's.</TE>
<TE>   When Luis reached the flaming building, he spotted an employee whose
name he couldn't remember, and he yelled, "Where's my brother?"</TE>
<TE>   The young man said, "I don't know!" Then he added, "I think he might
still be in the building!"</TE>
<TE>   Luis Cetina then ran to the north side of the building and entered an
open area, splashing through four inches of water where the sprinklers
had activated.</TE>
<TE>   Another Ole's employee whom he recognized was standing there watching,
and Luis shouted, "Where's my brother?"</TE>
<TE>   The young man said to him, "I saw him a little while ago! He went back
inside!"</TE>
<TE>   "Back inside ?" Luis cried.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, there were people banging on the door! One of those fire doors
that dropped down!"</TE>
<TE>   Luis stayed right there, where there also used to be a laundermat at
which the children would wait while their mother washed the family's
clothes. Their dad would sometimes buy them an ice cream there at
Thrifty's, when he could afford it.</TE>
<TE>   It was 2 o'clock in the morning before he went home to face his mother
with the truth.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Troidl was at home with his wife, Kim, and their 5-year-old
daughter, Bethany. Matthew William, his 2 1/2-year-old son, was with his
grandparents, and while Kim was speaking on the phone there was an
emergency breakthrough on the line. It came from one of her brothers, who
said that Billy Deal had called about a fire at Ole's, and that Billy
couldn't find Ada and Matthew William.</TE>
<TE>   While en route to Ole's, Matthew Troidl and his wife kept reassuring
each other that it was probably a small fire, maybe a trash can or
dumpster, and that it had just caused some confusion. That's all it was.
Confusion.</TE>
<TE>   But when they arrived, they saw the ventilated roof shooting flames
100 feet in the air. And there were police cars and fire engines and
ambulances and chaos. But they managed to find Billy Deal in all that
pandemonium and he told them the worst.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Troidl said later that he had all kinds of crazy thoughts.
Maybe they'd gotten out a back door! Maybe they'd been hurt and were
already at a hospital! Maybe they'd crawled up in the air-conditioning
vent and were OK! Maybe. So many of them just kept thinking, maybe.</TE>
<TE>   The man designated to lead a six-man investigative team the next
morning was Sgt. Jack Palmer, a 25-year law- enforcement veteran assigned
to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department arson explosives detail.
He had investigated nearly 5,000 fires in his 12 years as an arson cop
and had the resources of the county from which to draw. The tiny South
Pasadena Fire Department needed vast assistance for this major disaster,
and the LASD in their green jumpsuits--the Lean Green Machine-- were
there in force.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer immediately did his walk-around of the ravaged structure,
looking for the fire's point of origin. The west portion of Ole's was
destroyed, and the east side showed heat and water damage from sprinklers
that had gone off.</TE>
<TE>   Skip loaders and bulldozers were moving debris while the
investigators, armed with shovels and wheelbarrows, tried to find the
bodies of the four missing victims--Ada Deal and Matthew William Troidl,
Carolyn Krause and Jimmy Cetina. Each time a skip loader would snare a
load, investigators had to look inside for remnants of charred human
beings. Palmer saw the crane remove twisted steel beams from the center
of the building where the roof had collapsed, and he talked with an
employee who had been called to the scene. Palmer was told that plastic
products had been on display, but he was not told that there were racks
full of polyurethane foam products, which, he would later say, "go like
wildfire."</TE>
<TE>   After his hour-and-a-half investigation, the arson cop decided that he
was unable to eliminate as a fire cause the possibility of electrical
shorting in the attic area. He later said that the fire was very hard to
read because there was so much potential fuel in the store, and that
overhead burning, which caused ceiling material to drop and start
secondary fires, could have ignited numerous hot spots.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Obdam was interviewed by Palmer, and he told the investigator that
he'd observed a column of dark smoke nearly two feet in diameter in the
southeast part of the store, by the housewares section. But Palmer never
interviewed Anthony Colantuano, the employee who not only saw smoke in
that area but saw fire burning in the racks, an amazingly fast fire that
chased him and created a draft of its own, blowing him out the door.
Palmer did learn that there were two other retail store fires in the area
on that terrible evening, and that they had both been deemed arson fires,
but he decided that since they were set in potato chip racks and not
polyfoam, they were probably unconnected to the Ole's blaze. Soon, in the
northern portion of the ruined building, far from where Jim Obdam and
Anthony Colantuano had seen the first column of smoke, searchers found
human remains.</TE>
<TE>   Another fire investigator who had arrived on the scene at 7 a.m. was a
supervisor with the arson-bomb unit of the California State Fire
Marshal's Office, where he'd worked for 16 years. Jim Allen, like any
arson investigator, was looking for signs of the fire's direction.
Normally fire moves upward through a heat transfer process, and as it
hits a surface--a wall, a ceiling--it follows the path of least
resistance, spreading out in a V pattern, upward and outward. The V, or
convex, pattern reveals the point of origin in a simple fire, but the
Ole's disaster had not been simple.</TE>
<TE>   Allen noted that it was in the center of the building that the roof
had collapsed. In addition, after temperatures in the location reached
160 degrees and melted the doors' fusible links, both the north and south
steel fire doors had rolled down as they were designed to do. The speed
and heat of this fire had been astonishing, and those doors had sealed
egress quickly, very quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Allen had stayed about seven hours, a lot longer than Palmer, and
after three or four of the aisles had been dug out, he prowled through
the southeast corner with Orr, a friend and colleague who had also
arrived on the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Allen was of the opinion that the investigation, like the fire, was
moving too fast. This fire had caught up with people trying to outrun it,
so there had to have been a large load of fuel. Of course he knew that
polyurethane foam is a hydrocarbon fuel that comes from a petroleum
product, with the burn characteristic of petroleum, but he did not learn
of its presence, not that day.</TE>
<TE>   Allen didn't like the speed with which Palmer's conclusions were being
offered, and he said so to Orr, but Orr failed to tell Allen that there
had been two other retail store fires in the area the night before. And
he never mentioned that he had been at the scene of one of them to
consult and was the official investigator on the other. Three such fires
might indicate an arson series, and play a significant role in
determining the nature of the Ole's fire.</TE>
<TE>   During the early afternoon, Allen, Orr and other arson investigators
were ordered out of the area by a tall sheriff's department lieutenant
who said, "We're going into body recovery now."</TE>
<TE>   When Allen protested, the tall lieutenant said, "You can leave or run
the risk of being arrested for interfering."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to never learning about the polyfoam in the southeast
quadrant of the building, Allen was curtailed by the LASD investigators,
who said that all witnesses would be interviewed by them.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting that then took place in Ole's shopping center, at a
Winchell's doughnut shop, Palmer said to the huddle of fire
investigators, "I can't eliminate an electrical problem in the concealed
space between the false ceiling and the roof." Ultimately, Palmer
believed it had been a "drop-down" attic fire probably caused by faulty
electrical.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't come up with a point of origin," Allen offered. "Let's
keep going."</TE>
<TE>   "We should be unified with our conclusion," Palmer said, but Allen
replied, "I'm writing up my report that it's an undetermined fire. I
don't know for sure if it started in the attic or where it started."</TE>
<TE>   There was no spirited debate. The dozen or so arson investigators, who
had shoveled through the debris and watched the recovery of four bodies,
ate their doughnuts and drank their coffee, and by their silence
acquiesced to Palmer's conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   To understand the compliance of so many trained arson specialists at
the fire scene, one must understand the hierarchy and class structure
that divides the profession. First, there are arson investigators who
have been drawn from the firefighting ranks. Although they have peace
officer status, carry firearms and effect the arrests of fire-setting
criminals, they are and always will be, to the other class just
gun-toting firefighters who, if they depart from arson investigation,
will go back to the firehouse to scrub hoses and polish chrome.</TE>
<TE>   These other arson investigators, those who come from the ranks of the
police service, are first and foremost cops. They are law-enforcement
officers assigned to arson investigation and will be law-enforcement
officers after leaving the arson ranks. Their K-9 symbol is the German
shepherd, the true descendant of the wolf, not some white-and-black bag
of spots that chases a fire truck.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Palmer was not a cop from a town like South Pasadena or any of
the other little cities that make up the foothills area and the San
Gabriel Valley. He was with an agency that numbered in the thousands, the
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which, along with the Los
Angeles Police Department, was one of the major police entities in
California. The Lean Green Machine sometimes was called by critics the
Mean Green Machine. Fire investigator Jim Allen, who had, early in his
adult life, been a San Joaquin deputy sheriff, knew who wins in such
debates between cops and firemen. So when Palmer essentially called it an
accidental fire, there was not much argument. In fact, people never did
speak publicly of their differing opinions, not for a long time. They all
knew who the Big Dog was.</TE>
<TE>   John Orr was especially angered by Palmer's meeting and placed a call
late that morning to Dennis Foote, a fellow arson investigator for the
city of Los Angeles Fire Department. He asked Foote if he or some other
member of the mutual aid force, the Foothill Arson Task Force Group,
could respond to assist with the Ole's inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Orr also wanted to see a file that Foote had been compiling, a file
dealing with a fire series that had been occurring in Los Angeles and the
vicinity for about four years. Some of those fires involved the ignition
of potato chips; others involved combustible materials such as polyfoam.
What they had in common was their occurrence in retail establishments
during business hours, usually in the afternoon or early evening.</TE>
<TE>   On one of those investigations Foote had collected a delay device that
was different from most cigarette-matchbook devices. This one, or what
was left of it, was a Marlboro cigarette with three paper matches
attached to it by a rubber band. Such a device provided up to 15 minutes
or more for an arsonist to leave a store before the burning cigarette
ignited the matches, which in turn ignited flammable material around
them.</TE>
<TE>   When Foote arrived at Ole's, Orr told him that there had been other
fires in the area the night before, and that possibly a delay device had
been used to start them. Foote put on his helmet and his rubber boots and
entered Ole's with Orr, but that area of the building was just about
destroyed and the sheriff's investigators were already finishing up.
Before he left, Foote gave his file--he called it "The Potato Chip
File"--to Orr.</TE>
<TE>   Then, a few days later, a peculiar thing happened: A fire erupted in
Builder's Emporium in North Hollywood. It was in the polyfoam section,
like so many of the others. Foote wanted another look at Ole's, another
chance to determine if the Ole's fire could have been ignited in polyfoam
products that burn violently. But it was too late. A wrecking company had
cleared almost all debris from the building space.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Troidl had tried to call his parents, who lived in the Bay
Area, but when his father answered, Troidl couldn't speak. Troidl's wife,
Kim, had to take the phone and tell the older man that his grandson was
dead. And Troidl couldn't personally make the funeral arrangements for
his son. He just sat in the house and rocked back and forth.</TE>
<TE>   They decided to bury the two of them in the same casket, Ada Deal
cradling her grandson in her arms.</TE>
<TE>   The Pasadena Star News reported that more than 1,200 people packed the
church for the funeral of Jimmy Cetina. The monsignor had decided to have
the Mass during school hours, and the classrooms emptied. The police had
to block traffic for miles down San Gabriel Boulevard for the 200 cars
that drove to the cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Cetina had applied for the job at Ole's to help out the family
with the purchase of a used white Volkswagen. They couldn't afford
insurance yet, so nobody had driven the car. It was parked in the
backyard, and Jimmy had liked to sit in it and tell his family what he
was going to do to fix it up. But Jimmy never got to drive it. His
brother drove it behind Jimmy's hearse in the funeral cortege. Later they
sold it. His father couldn't bear to have that white car around anymore.</TE>
<TE>   If dalmatians deferred to police dogs that day at the Ole's calamity,
there were other canine cousins on the prowl, sniffing and panting and
baying at the possibilities. And these could outsmell any tracking dog,
or bomb dog, or dope dog, or cadaver dog that ever lived. These could
simply point a nose at a headline, then raise up and smell it in the air:
grief, misery, death! They were contingency-driven trial lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   When all was said and done, everybody would be sued: Ole's, its parent
company, electrical contractors, subcontractors, anybody who might be
willing to fork over some big bucks either through their insurance
carriers or from their own pockets, or from Grandma's sugar bowl. When
the Ole's Home Center investigation officially concluded, with the
finding of probable electrical malfunction in the attic space, the trial
lawyers and the defendants settled out of court for $4 million, costs
that usually get passed on to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   John Orr spoke to Karen Krause at the Glendale PD a few days after her
sister-in-law's funeral and said how disappointed he was that the fire
had been called accidental. He told her of other such fires in home
improvement companies, specifically mentioning Builder's Emporium in
North Hollywood, where a fire had been started in a polypropylene
mattress but, luckily, was extinguished by the sprinkler system, with
remnants of a delay device left behind.</TE>
<TE>   "There should've been investigators present at the autopsies of the
victims," he told her. "Polypropylene may have left particles in the
victims' lungs or in their tracheas. Or there may have been gases present
that were absorbed in the bodies, and it might've come out in a proper
autopsy."</TE>
<TE>   If there had been investigators there knowing what to look for. But
there were not, and now no one would ever know.</TE>
<TE>   Two months after the October 1984 Ole's calamity in South Pasadena,
another disaster nearly befell that unfortunate company. The Ole's Home
Center on Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena barely escaped a similar fate. A
partially burned incendiary device was found by an employee.</TE>
<TE>   Arson investigators called it a "signature device": the cigarette, the
three paper matches and a rubber band. It was found in a partially burned
stack of polyfoam that had been scorched but hadn't fully ignited. This
signature device was known only to local arson investigators, who hadn't
publicized it, therefore it couldn't be a copycat. Some wondered if the
fire setter had graduated from potato chips to bigger targets.</TE>
<TE>   Another possibility would not be considered for some time to come: by
attacking the second Ole's store, perhaps a fire setter was making a
statement to the entire arson investigating community--that they had got
it wrong the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Epilogue: In September 1998, John Orr was sentenced to four
consecutive life terms in prison without the possibility of parole for
the 1984 fire at Ole's Home Center, in addition to 20 years for other
fires that damaged or destroyed dozens of homes in La Ca-ada and Glendale
in the early 1990s.</TE>

<LD>Liv and Glen Ballard searched a long time before they found a
finely detailed, Spanish-style house designed in 1926 by architect Roy
Seldon Price. The grand beauty they discovered features arched walls and
doors, vintage ironwork and hand-painted California tiles. But in
contrast to these riches, the garden had little character. Beyond palm
trees and two small existing fountains, there was little that reflected
the spirit of the house. Lawns dominated the front yard; yellow daisies
and rhaphiolepis crowded planting beds; hardscape (yards and yards of
driveway, motorcourt and a '60s-era pool deck) consisted of blank,
decrepit concrete.</LD>
<LD>   The Ballards hired Brian Tichenor and Raun Thorp of Tichenor &amp; Thorp
Architects to make a landscape worthy of the house and extend indoor
living spaces into terraces framed with plants. The architects literally
took the home's layout outside, mirroring its strong central axis in an
entry path edged with westringia, campanula and bronze flax. Beside the
front door, they restored an old fountain, adding a tiled pool and extra
water jets and installing a bench nearby so the scene could be enjoyed.
"Previously," says Tichenor, "there was nowhere to sit. The outdoors
wasn't articulated or defined, except as leftover space from the house.
Our job was to create those specific, missing places."</LD>
<TE>   The clients had a few requests. Liv Ballard wanted sun-loving lavender
and roses; her husband, a music producer, asked for bougainvillea and
something "dazzling" in place of the mundane front lawn. Given existing
trees and screening hedges, which cast heavy shade but provided privacy,
the designers restricted Liv's flowers to a bright corner of the motor
court. To enliven other areas, they got creative with shade borders,
layering 'Chocolate Mint' geraniums amid Agave attenuata and bronze flax,
and pairing Heuchera micrantha var. diversifolia 'Palace Purple' with
chartreuse Helichrysum petiolare 'Limelight' and snowy 'White Doves'
camellias.</TE>
<TE>   For extra dazzle in the front, Tichenor called up the Spanish flavor
of the house and installed a citrus grove with an angled channel in its
midst that carries water from a tiny tiled and bubbling pool to a
star-shaped fountain. And he looked to Spain for new mosaic-like
hardscape that sets off paving stones with grouted-pebble seams.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, he and Thorp used potted plants to break up the concrete
deck around the pool. "Pots bring garden to seating areas and make them
feel roomlike and inhabited," Thorp says. Annie Kelly, who did the
Ballards' lush, Andalusian-style interiors, designed the wrought-iron
garden furniture. She also contributed details to a walled garden terrace
off the dining room, working with architect Michael Mekeel, for example,
to design an outdoor fireplace.</TE>
<TE>   While such amenities draw the Ballards out in all seasons, the couple
also revel in the garden from inside the house. "As we worked, we
considered views from every window," recalls Tichenor. Adds Thorp, "We
also considered scent." Near the bedrooms, they planted heliotrope,
ginger, gardenia and stephanotis, specifically, Liv says, "for summer
nights. Throw the doors open, crack the windows, let the fragrances drift
in."</TE>

<DH>Though His Grandmother's Cooking Struck Fear in Many, One Recipe
Remains a Family Treasure</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In addition to being the world's finest purveyor of unconditional
love, my father's mother--we called her "Ma"--was perhaps the world's
worst cook. Mixed with my fond memories of Sunday dinners at her house in
Birmingham, Ala., are somewhat less fond memories of a menu that seldom
varied: oven-forged pot roast, lumpy mashed potatoes, limp green beans
and sticky-sweet iced tea.</LD>
<LD>   Her way with fried "pepper" eggs was as frightening as it was
legendary. My older cousins spread dark rumors about sentient residents
in the dusty cereal boxes atop Ma's refrigerator. I was even afraid of
the candy dishes she placed around the house for visiting grandkids.
Lint, moisture and hair from her malodorous, snuffling Boston terrier
settled on the unwrapped candy she bought in bulk. The nuggets always
fused into a single, sugary mass, and eventually to the bottom of the
dish. Nothing was more awkward than the inevitable moment when she'd pull
me into her prodigious, welcoming bosom and whisper an invitation that my
parents couldn't hear: "There's candy on the coffee table, darlin'. Go
get yourself some."</LD>
<TE>   All of this presented a dilemma last year when we decided to create a
cookbook of family recipes to distribute at our family reunion, which
we've held in Ma's honor every other year since she died in 1985. How
could we publish a chronicle of favorite family recipes without including
at least something from the beloved family matriarch? Fortunately,
there's Ma 'Slaw.</TE>
<TE>   In the Deep South, coleslaw is the dietary equivalent of oxygen. It's
everywhere--in teensy hard-plastic bowls perched on the edge of your rib
plate, on top of your barbecue pork sandwich, oozing from its pile on one
side of your fried catfish platter into the mound of fried okra on the
other.</TE>
<TE>   Recipes vary. Some even include vinegar instead of mayonnaise. They're
all good. The only way to really screw up coleslaw--besides adding hair
from a Boston terrier--is to dump everything into a food processor and
hit the start button. The blades reduce the cabbage and other ingredients
to a fine slurry about the consistency of wallpaper paste. It might taste
OK, but coleslaw shouldn't go down like grits. It should crunch. You
should have to fork it into your mouth like hay. It should be sweet, too,
but fie on those with an overactive mayo hand. Restraint, people,
restraint.</TE>
<TE>   Ma's version upholds no tradition of which I'm aware. It has tomatoes
in it, for heaven's sake, and a scandalous ratio of onions to cabbage.
Preparing it is more mechanics than art. Armed with only a cutting board
and a big, nasty chopping knife, you can hand-make a giant bowl of it
about 10 minutes before you put it on the picnic table next to the
collards and summer squash.</TE>
<TE>   But take it from someone who knows: Just as there was no one like the
woman in whose memory we still gather, there's no 'slaw like Ma 'Slaw.</TE>
<TE>Ma 'Slaw</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>They were packed into the ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria, 1,400
cheering Friends of the Israeli Defense Forces. When Jerusalem Mayor Ehud
Olmert vowed to destroy Palestinian terrorism, he got an ovation.</LD>
<LD>   But one businessman, whose family donated $88,000 to the cause, was
wringing his hands over Olmert's vow that the army would conduct itself
honorably. "I believe we should not hold back," said Ronald Edelstein,
belittling "this nonsense of morals, when our Arab colleagues have none."</LD>
<LD>   Across town, at a progressive synagogue on Manhattan's Upper West
Side, Rabbi Rolando Matalo was torn between his longtime support for
Palestinian human rights and his support for an Israel under siege.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a definite void on the left," said Matalo, who recently
disavowed a controversial newspaper ad that praised dissident Israeli
soldiers in the West Bank for not "following orders" and enforcing a
"brutal occupation."</TE>
<TE>   These are tumultuous and difficult times for American Jews, who long
have been divided over the proper path to peace in the Middle East.
Although many have put aside their sharp ideological differences in
recent weeks and joined publicly to support Israel, they continue to be
ambivalent about a long-term solution.</TE>
<TE>   Many American Jewish leaders say Israel's current state of
emergency--and growing signs of anti-Semitism around the world--have
unified the faithful here in a way not seen since the 1967 and 1973 wars.
Yet they concede that deep-seated disagreements on the left and right
cannot be suppressed forever, making it unclear where the Jewish
community goes from here.</TE>
<TE>   This is a watershed moment, said Samuel G. Freedman, a journalist and
author of "Jew Vs. Jew: The Struggle for the Soul of American Jewry." But
he cautioned that the U.S. philosophical conflict over Israel and its
future reflects an age-old tension. "On the one hand, there's been a
universalist feeling among Jews that they need to respect human rights
and work toward peace," Freedman said. "Yet there's also an embrace of
tribalism--a feeling that we're now under siege, that nobody in the world
likes us, so it's time to circle the wagons."</TE>
<TE>Currently a Tilt Toward Tribalism</TE>
<TE>   These feelings shift back and forth, but right now they're tilting
toward tribalism. A pro-Israel rally this month in Washington drew more
than 150,000 people and grabbed national headlines. Thousands also have
shown up at rallies in Chicago, New York, Detroit and other cities. A
gathering April 21 in Encino attracted more than 40,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't recall a time in modern history when Jews have felt so
vulnerable," said Rabbi Martin Hier, dean and founder of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. "Let me tell you how bad the tension
is: At wedding ceremonies, under the canopy, announcements are being made
about events unfolding in the Middle East."</TE>
<TE>   This week, the center will be mailing out 600,000 "call to action"
brochures that say "Israel is fighting for her life" and urge American
Jews to contact government leaders and media organizations worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the lobbying has generated results. House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay (R-Texas) is sponsoring a resolution with Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San
Mateo) declaring that lawmakers are "gravely concerned that [Palestinian
leader Yasser] Arafat's actions are not those of a viable partner for
peace." Lawmakers have proposed other measures--some calling for
sanctions against Palestinians or Syrians who support terrorism, others
demanding a resumption of the peace process.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Mark Diamond, executive vice president of the Board of Rabbis of
Southern California, said debate over the West Bank invasion and the
attack on the Palestinian Jenin refugee camp is overshadowed by "a strong
sense that Israel needs us, that the world Jewry needs us, that this is
our wake-up call."</TE>
<TE>   He said he has been overwhelmed in recent weeks by numerous calls from
members of synagogues asking what they can do to help or where they can
send a check.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly Israel is at war, and innocents suffer, and that is
lamentable," said Diamond, who recently returned from a trip to Israel
with 12 other Los Angeles-area Jewish leaders. "But there is a profound
moral difference here: Israeli people do not intentionally target
innocents and civilians. That cannot be said of Palestinian bombers."</TE>
<TE>   As many Jews momentarily drop long-standing disputes and rally
together, however, some voice doubts about the overall message being
sent. Many who attended the Washington rally were stunned when Deputy
Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, one of the administration's more
hawkish Middle East advisors, was booed for endorsing a Palestinian state
and saying innocent Palestinians were suffering.</TE>
<TE>   Mainstream Jewish leaders sought to play down the crowd's reaction,
saying Wolfowitz's comments were either misconstrued or clumsily phrased.
But the fact remains that, for some American Jews, the current
mobilization to support the state of Israel does not translate into a
long-term endorsement of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's military tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, doubts about long-held views abound on all sides.</TE>
<TE>   "I have American friends who might have been moderate before on the
issue of negotiating peace, but now they think: 'Our whole survival is at
stake, so let's just destroy them all,' " said Victor Nye, a Brooklyn,
N.Y., businessman who describes himself as a passionate supporter of
Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "I also know people who scratch their heads and say, 'If you keep
bombing Arabs, how can you expect to make a lasting peace with them?' "</TE>
<TE>   As many Jewish leaders call for unity, some fear that U.S. voices
critical of Sharon have been silenced and intimidated. Rabbi Michael
Lerner, a Bay Area activist who helped establish the progressive Tikkun
magazine, drew flak last month for sponsoring the controversial New York
Times advertisement.</TE>
<TE>'Those Who Question Are Seen as Traitors'</TE>
<TE>   He says his core beliefs--including support for Israel and criticism
of Palestinian terrorism--have been distorted by critics. But more
important, Lerner rattles off recent e-mails he has received that reflect
anxiety among some Jews that they will be ostracized for criticizing
Sharon's actions.</TE>
<TE>   Some Jewish leaders, he charges, have created a "neo-McCarthyite
sensibility," where "those who question are seen as traitors."</TE>
<TE>   For others, the problem is more philosophical. Daniel Sokatch,
executive director of the Progressive Jewish Alliance in Southern
California, said 400 people recently crowded into a town meeting
sponsored by his group. The topic: how to support Israel without
condoning its military attacks.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, there has been an evolution among many progressive
critics of Israel, a belief that they have been betrayed by Palestinian
Authority President Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll confess, I was one of the most vocal who said we had to make
peace with the Palestinians," said Arthur Hertzberg, a longtime Jewish
leader and prolific New York author. "But it's become ever clearer to us
on the left that he [Arafat] has no interest in ending this bloody
quarrel."</TE>
<TE>   His political support for Israel is absolute, Hertzberg said, "but I
won't be euchred by Sharon. I do not support the long-term occupation of
Palestinian lands, because this would be morally indefensible."</TE>
<TE>   Leaders on the right raise different moral issues, saying there is no
equivalency between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian suicide bombers in
Tel Aviv.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen planes crash into the [World Trade Center] twin towers and
kill thousands, and it's just a short step to people wrapping themselves
in explosives and coming into American cities," said Rabbi Avi Weiss, a
prominent New York activist. "Israel must defend itself, just as America
surely would."</TE>
<TE>   As the U.S. debate rages, many observers say it is similar to the
political crosscurrents in Israel. There, activists on the left and the
right continue to disagree, even though they have been united by a sense
of emergency.</TE>
<TE>   But there is one telling difference: A broad majority of Israelis now
endorse a middle ground between peace at any cost and war, according to
J.J. Goldberg, editor of the Forward, a New York-based populist newspaper
that dates to 1897. Strength through compromise, as the policy is known,
calls for Israeli forces to withdraw to a defensible line--and for Israel
to fortify itself against future attacks with barbed wire, massive troop
deployments and other buffers.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't hear many Americans talking about the idea of separation,
even though it's a widely held view in the Israeli establishment,"
Goldberg said. "And I think this omission has left the U.S. debate
impoverished. You could argue that many Jews in this country aren't
getting the full story."</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe they've seen too much. Numbed by images of horror and
drowning once again in a debate about the Middle East, American Jews like
Nye are torn, even as they support the state of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "If a suicide bomber came into Brooklyn and killed children here, I
would be terrified, I would be outraged, like anyone else," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But as a Jew, I wonder why this problem can't be solved. If Arafat
and Sharon sat down and had to show each other pictures of their
grandchildren, how could they possibly want to kill them? We're all human
beings."</TE>

<DL>LAUGHLIN, Nev.
</DL>
<LD>An escalating turf battle between rival motorcycle gangs erupted
into a shootout at a casino Saturday morning, killing three people,
sending panic-stricken gamblers diving for cover and shutting down the
Mojave Desert town for several hours.</LD>
<LD>   The melee of gunfire, stabbings and fistfights broke out about 2:15
a.m. at Harrah's Casino &amp; Hotel as the town was packed with as many as
80,000 visitors attending the 20th annual bikers' party called the
Laughlin River Run.</LD>
<LD>   At least 16 people were injured in the casino, police said, and the
body of a biker gang member was later found on Interstate 40 in San
Bernardino County, where he had ridden on his motorcycle.</LD>
<TE>   At least one man was arrested and 70 to 100 others were detained for
questioning after the shootout, which prompted the temporary closure of
highways and a bridge leading out of town.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw a bunch of people fighting, then all of a sudden we heard
gunshots--bang, bang, bang," said Aniko Kegyulics, 25, who was near the
casino bar when the chaos began. "Everybody fell to the floor."</TE>
<TE>   Police said the casino clash culminated a nearly 18-month feud between
the Hells Angels and Mongols motorcycle gangs, which had been fighting
over territory and membership.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of police were brought in from California and Arizona to patrol
the town, and remained in force overnight because of fears of more
trouble. "There are threats of retaliation," said Larry Tunforss, a
spokesman for the Bullhead City Fire Department in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   By late Saturday, all routes into Laughlin were reopened and the
riverfront gambling town was virtually back in business without further
violence, police said. Motorcycles roared through town as visitors and
residents ate, gambled and strolled through the streets.</TE>
<TE>   The casino confrontation began when a group of about 30 Hells Angels
members rode from the Flamingo Hotel to Harrah's, looking for members of
the Mongols gang, said Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sgt. Chris Darcy.</TE>
<TE>   A few members of the gangs faced off, quickly drawing a crowd as the
confrontation escalated into a larger fight that involved 60 to 70
people. "The knives came out and then the guns came out and people
started shooting," Darcy said.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes, 16 people had been wounded, Darcy said. None of the
injured are believed to be tourists or hotel employees. Hotel
surveillance cameras videotaped the fight. Las Vegas Police Lt. Vincent
Cannito said the video showed "a lot of shooting, a lot of stabbing."</TE>
<TE>   "It's an unbelievable video," Darcy said. "It's horrific."</TE>
<TE>   Javier Corzo, 37, said he was playing slot machines when the fight
began.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, a wave of people came running through the bar area,"
he said. "I heard gunfire--a whole bunch of shots. Everybody just hit the
floor."</TE>
<TE>   Corzo said he saw several people pull out guns and two people get hit
by the gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   His friend, Rick Edwards, said hotel guests scattered when the fight
began, running up stairs and hopping onto elevators.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure the cops had a hard time finding whoever was involved," he
said, adding that he couldn't get to his room and spent most of the night
in a hotel stairwell.</TE>
<TE>Bystanders Separated From Participants</TE>
<TE>   Police and fire personnel stormed into the hotel lobby shortly after
the shooting, ordered people to the ground and separated bystanders from
participants. Two police officers fired their weapons, Darcy said. One
officer's gun accidentally discharged, while the other officer shot at
someone. Police were still investigating whether anyone was hit by
police.</TE>
<TE>   John Barrett, a battalion commander for the Bullhead City Fire
Department, said at least 100 people were handcuffed or lying spread
eagle on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Barrett said that when he arrived, there were several weapons
scattered on the ground. Police recovered several knives and guns from
the scene.</TE>
<TE>   The three dead in Laughlin are believed to be bikers, police said.
Their names were not released. Hospitals treated 13 people, some with
gunshot and stab wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Most were in stable or fair condition, but at least one man had a
skull fracture and was in critical condition, hospital officials said.
Two men who were shot are believed to be suspects, Tunforss said.</TE>
<TE>   Less than an hour after the casino bloodshed, the body of 28-year-old
Christian Tate of San Diego was found on the shoulder of the interstate
near the small, desert town of Ludlow, said a San Bernardino County
coroner's official and Chip Patterson, a spokesman for that county's
Sheriff's Department. The victim's bike, along with shell casings, were
also found.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson said police believe Tate was shot as he rode his motorcycle,
and that the death is "likely connected in some way to the shooting in
Laughlin."</TE>
<TE>   The Mongols originated in the 1970s in Southern California and counts
among its former members Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura. In May 2000, 41
members of the Mongols in Southern California were arrested on an array
of charges, including murder, after a 2 1/2-year federal investigation.
Authorities seized 101 firearms, four pounds of cocaine and six pounds of
methamphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   The Hells Angels was formed in 1948 in Fontana and cultivated its
reputation as outlaws during the 1960s, when members clashed with police
in Porterville, Calif., and battled with anti-Vietnam protesters in
Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, the Hells Angels attempted to change its image by
holding charity events and recruiting young professionals. A longtime
spokesman, George Christie Jr., was sentenced to three years' probation
after pleading guilty in March to conspiring to sell drugs.</TE>
<TE>   San Benito County Sheriff Curtis J. Hill said the two gangs have been
positioning for who is going to control certain areas of the West.
Mongols have been recruiting from Los Angeles street gangs and are
infringing on traditional Hells Angels territory, Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been tremendous friction between these two groups--not only
in California but nationwide," he said. "The violence overflowed into
Laughlin and the River Run event."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Cushing, undersheriff of Santa Clara County, said he is urging
the county to reject a request for a Hells Angels rally scheduled this
summer.</TE>
<TE>   "This is far too volatile a situation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, the escalation has forced law enforcement agencies to ramp
up surveillance and consider canceling other biker events. Over the
Fourth of July weekend, about 50,000 motorcycle enthusiasts are expected
to converge in Hollister, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose police spokesman Joseph Deras said that any time you bring
these bikers together there is a potential for violence. "When I heard
the news in Laughlin, I wasn't the least surprised," he said. "It's been
coming."</TE>
<TE>   After the shootout, Harrah's shut down the hotel and casino. The hotel
reopened mid-morning and part of the casino reopened later in the day.
But detectives were still sorting through evidence in a taped-off portion
of the casino late Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the day, police towed dozens of bikes from Harrah's parking
lot. By early evening, Harrah's was again bustling with gamblers. People
were pulling slots just 15 yards from where detectives marked bullet
casings and worked behind crime tape.</TE>
<TE>Counseling Offered to Guests, Employees</TE>
<TE>   The hotel, a Mexican-themed resort with 1,601 rooms, offered
counseling to employees and guests, and set up a hotline for updates.</TE>
<TE>   "We are deeply disturbed that this tragic event has occurred at
Harrah's Laughlin," said Bill Keena, senior vice president and general
manager. "As always, our primary concern is for the safety and welfare of
our customers and employees."</TE>
<TE>   After the melee, a bridge between Bullhead City and Laughlin was shut
down, as were other access points into Laughlin, as reports brewed that
more gang members were itching to get into the city to continue the
fight.</TE>
<TE>   Laughlin, located 90 miles south of Las Vegas along the Colorado River
where California, Nevada and Arizona meet, is a booming gaming town. Many
of its 8,000 residents work as bartenders, cashiers and dealers in the
town's 11 casinos.</TE>
<TE>   Laughlin has become a destination for Californians looking for a
weekend getaway. Its popularity has helped Laughlin pass the Reno-Tahoe
area as the second-largest generator of revenue in Nevada, according to
1998 statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, bikers roar into town for the Laughlin River Run, boosting
revenues of hotels, shops and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   The four-day event, which began with just 500 riders, has become so
mainstream that the Laughlin Area Chamber of Commerce promotes it on its
Web site. This year, among the scheduled events were concerts with the
Doobie Brothers and Grand Funk Railroad, and a custom bike show offering
$4,000 worth of prizes.</TE>
<TE>   "Some problems are unavoidable when 50,000 people congregate," said
Joelle Hurns, the chamber's executive director. "You're always going to
have an element that is undesirable."</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Cuomo, 66, believes the violence will not dampen local
enthusiasm for the River Run.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not going to cancel. The locals all work in the casinos.
What are they going to say?" Cuomo said. "We need the people."</TE>
<TE>   Grace Leslie, 36, of Orange County said she and her boyfriend weren't
going to cut their trip short because of the shooting. "We're going
riding," she said. "We've been cooped up here too long."</TE>
<TE>   Sonny Ald, who works at D'Angelo's Italian Restaurant in the River
Palms casino, said the shooting has not deterred visitors who packed the
streets of Laughlin on Saturday afternoon, causing a traffic jam.</TE>
<TE>   "People are still coming in from California and Colorado," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't close down Laughlin," Ald said. "The casinos are still
open."</TE>

<HD>4 Jewish Settlers Killed in Attack</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Palestinian gunmen disguised as Israeli soldiers lead a
bloody morning assault on an isolated West Bank community.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ADORA, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Palestinian gunmen disguised as Israeli soldiers cut through a
fence surrounding this isolated Jewish settlement Saturday and raced from
house to house, shooting residents at breakfast, on the street and in
their beds, the Israeli army said.</LD>
<LD>   Four people, including a 5-year-old girl, were killed, and seven
others wounded in the brazen daylight rampage, the deadliest such attack
since Israel launched a sweeping offensive against Palestinian militants
in the West Bank a month ago.</LD>
<LD>   The assailants, two or possibly three men, managed to escape into the
surrounding hills after the attack, but an army spokeswoman said one was
killed later Saturday in a firefight with Israeli soldiers in a nearby
village.</LD>
<TE>   The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical faction
of the Palestine Liberation Organization, claimed responsibility for the
attack. Israel earlier said it blamed the Palestinian Authority of Yasser
Arafat, who has been trapped by Israeli tanks and troops in his
headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah for nearly a month. Israel
has insisted that Arafat do more to rein in the militants who have
targeted Israeli civilians in a devastating wave of suicide bombings and
other attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli retaliation for Saturday's killings appeared all but certain,
although it was unclear how quickly it might come. Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon, whose army chief of staff visited the bloodied scenes of the
shootings here Saturday, summoned his security Cabinet to an urgent
meeting today.</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat is the leader of the Palestinian Authority, and he and his
leadership have not changed their strategy of terror," Sharon advisor
Danny Ayalon said late Saturday. "They are responsible."</TE>
<TE>   Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian Cabinet official, instead blamed the
violence on Israel's long-standing occupation of the West Bank and its
recent reentry into key Palestinian cities.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharon should look in the mirror to see who's responsible for these
things," Erekat said. "We don't condone violence on either side, but hate
breeds hate. There will never be a military solution here."</TE>
<TE>   At the security Cabinet meeting, the government is also expected to
decide whether to cooperate with a United Nations fact-finding commission
that plans to arrive here today to investigate Israel's recent three-week
occupation of the Jenin refugee camp. The team's arrival was delayed last
week after Israel voiced objections to its mission.</TE>
<TE>   In Adora, a hilltop settlement of about 300 people about five miles
west of the Palestinian city of Hebron, tearful, shaken residents
embraced one another after Saturday's attack and called on the government
to retaliate swiftly against the killers and those who sent them.</TE>
<TE>   "After what they did to women, to children, we know we have business
with these animals," said Gil Soffer, 42, an accounting firm employee who
saw his neighbor, Yaakov Katz, shot to death Saturday. "We cannot talk to
them."</TE>
<TE>   Residents and army officials said it was just before 9 a.m. when the
gunmen entered the settlement. Many of Adora's male residents were
attending Sabbath prayers in the community's synagogue, residents said;
their weapons, a constant feature of life for many West Bank settlers,
had been left at home. And the four soldiers assigned to guard the
settlement were at Adora's opposite side, Soffer said.</TE>
<TE>   The assailants cut through the settlement's wire perimeter fence near
several homes under construction, according to an army spokesman. Wearing
what witnesses said appeared to be Israeli army uniforms and carrying
M-16 and Kalashnikov assault rifles, the men separated inside the
settlement and targeted different houses, entering several and raking
others from outside with gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   Residents said the men operated in the settlement for at least half an
hour. The army estimates that it was about 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   One man entered the home of Shiri Shefi, who was sitting upstairs with
her three children--5-year-old Danielle and two sons, ages 4 and
1--residents said. The man sprayed the family with gunfire, wounding all
four and killing Danielle, who was shot in the head at point-blank range,
an army spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   In the synagogue a few hundred yards away, Soffer, Katz and other men
heard shots and came rushing up the hill to confront the gunmen. Soffer
stopped at home to grab his M-16. Then he and Katz, who was unarmed, saw
one of the men near Shefi's home. The man turned and fired, killing Katz,
who worked as a computer engineer, Soffer said.</TE>
<TE>   Anat Harari, 41, heard shooting and saw a young man in an army uniform
standing outside her kitchen window. She called her mother, Gila, another
resident of the settlement, to ask her if the army was conducting a
drill. But the man suddenly raised his gun and shot her in the shoulder,
Harari said later. She fled to a bathroom but stayed on the phone as the
man shot at other windows and tried repeatedly to enter her locked house.</TE>
<TE>   "I hid all that time in the bathroom, on the floor, bleeding. I was on
the phone with my parents the whole time, waiting for someone to rescue
me," she told Israeli television from her hospital bed.</TE>
<TE>   Another of the attackers entered the home of Katya and Vladimir
Greenberg, Russian immigrants whose household was still asleep. The man
crept upstairs and stopped in a first-floor doorway, shooting and
wounding the Greenbergs' 14-year-old son, Natan, in his bed.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli army Maj. Avner Fuxman, who led reporters through the bloodied
home later Saturday, said the man then went upstairs, where he shot the
couple in their bed. Katya Greenberg, a homemaker, was killed instantly;
her husband, a security guard, was severely injured, Fuxman said.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth victim was identified by settlement leaders as Arieh
Becker, a man in his 20s who worked as a guard at the settlement and was
killed pursuing the gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   Fuxman said he wished that he could speak to the U.N. committee that
hopes to investigate Palestinian claims that hundreds of civilians were
killed during Israel's occupation of Jenin. Israel has rejected the
claim, saying the Palestinians have exaggerated the number of casualties,
most of whom were fighters.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can just talk to this committee for 10 minutes and show them"
the Greenbergs' house, Fuxman said, "I think they will understand the
word 'massacre.' "</TE>
<TE>   The attack immediately raised tensions that had diminished slightly in
recent days, as Israel pulled out of most West Bank cities it entered
during the offensive, and as resolution of two remaining standoffs, in
Bethlehem and near Arafat's Ramallah headquarters, appeared nearer than
it was during the incursion.</TE>
<TE>   But late Saturday, Palestinians were bracing for retaliation,
especially in Hebron, the city nearest Adora. Police there were reported
to have evacuated several offices, apparently expecting a retaliatory
strike by Israel. And Israelis said they too feared another round of
violence in the days ahead.</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem, meanwhile, where Israeli troops have besieged about 200
Palestinian fighters and religious figures for nearly a month in the
Church of the Nativity, an Israeli sniper wounded a Palestinian man in
the church.</TE>
<TE>   An army spokesman said the man was armed and appeared to be preparing
an explosive device near the door of the church. Gunfire has erupted
frequently near the church since the siege began April 2, and both sides
have suffered casualties.</TE>
<TE>   In the day's only bright note, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
said they would meet today to discuss a possible resolution to the church
standoff. On Saturday, Israel allowed chief Palestinian negotiator Salah
Tamari to travel to Ramallah to discuss the situation with Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting, Tamari said he had received instructions from the
Palestinian leader, who he said is eager to resolve the Bethlehem
situation peacefully. He did not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   In Jerusalem before dawn today, police said an Israeli gunman was
arrested after wounding two people in a personal dispute. The incident
initially had been feared to be another terrorist attack.</TE>

<HD>Ruth Handler, Inventor of Barbie Doll, Dies at 85</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ruth Handler, the entrepreneur and marketing genius who co-founded
Mattel and created the Barbie doll, one of the world's most enduring and
popular toys, died Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Handler, 85, died at Century City Hospital in Los Angeles of
complications following colon surgery about three months ago, said her
husband, Elliot.</LD>
<LD>   The longtime Southern California resident defied prevailing trends in
the toy industry of the late 1950s when she proposed an alternative to
the flat-chested baby dolls then marketed to girls.</LD>
<TE>   Barbie, a teenage doll with a tiny waist, slender hips and impressive
bust, became not only a best-selling toy with more than 1 billion sold in
150 countries, but a cultural icon analyzed by scholars, attacked by
feminists and showcased in the Smithsonian Institution.</TE>
<TE>   Although best known for her pivotal role as Barbie's inventor, Handler
devoted her later years to a second, trailblazing career: manufacturing
and marketing artificial breasts for women who had undergone
mastectomies.</TE>
<TE>   Herself a breast cancer survivor, she personally sold and fitted the
prosthesis and crisscrossed the country as a spokeswoman for early
detection of the disease in the 1970s, when it was still a taboo subject.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing the continuity in her evolution from "Barbie's mom" to
prosthesis pioneer, Handler sometimes quipped, "I've lived my life from
breast to breast."</TE>
<TE>   Born Ruth Mosko, she was the youngest of 10 children of Polish
immigrants who settled in Denver. Her father was a blacksmith who
deserted the Russian army. Her mother, who was illiterate, arrived in the
United States in the steerage section of a steamship. Her mother's health
was so frail that Handler was raised by an older sister.</TE>
<TE>   When she was 19, she left Denver for a vacation in Hollywood and wound
up staying. Her high school boyfriend, Elliot Handler, followed her west
and married her in 1938. She worked as a secretary at Paramount Studios
while he studied industrial design at the Art Center School of Design in
Los Angeles (now Art Center College of Design in Pasadena).</TE>
<TE>   When Elliot made some simple housewares to furnish their apartment,
Ruth persuaded him to produce more for sale. They bought some workshop
equipment from Sears and launched a giftware business in their garage,
making items such as bowls, mirrors and clocks out of plastic. With Ruth
showing the product line to local stores, sales reached $2 million within
a few years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1942 they teamed up with another industrial designer, Harold "Matt"
Mattson, to launch a business manufacturing picture frames. Using
leftover wood and plastic scrap, they later launched a sideline making
dollhouse furniture. Within a few years, the company turned profitable
and began to specialize in toys. It was called Mattel, a name fashioned
from the "Matt" in Mattson and the "El" in Elliot.</TE>
<TE>   Early successes were musical toys, such as the Uke-A-Doodle, a
child-size ukulele, and a cap gun called the Burp gun, which the Handlers
advertised on the new medium of television. It was the first time a toy
had been sold on national television year-round.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1950s, Elliot was so preoccupied with the development of a
talking doll--eventually marketed as Chatty Cathy--that he was of little
help to Ruth when she came up with an idea of her own.</TE>
<TE>   Noting their daughter Barbara's fascination with paper dolls of
teenagers or career women, she realized there was a void in the market.
She began to wonder if a three-dimensional version of the adult paper
figures would have appeal. Why not sell a doll that allowed girls, as she
would later say, to "dream dreams of the future"? This doll, she mused,
would have to be lifelike. In other words, Handler believed, it would
have to have breasts.</TE>
<TE>   When she took the idea to Mattel's executives, who were men, they
sneered that no mother would buy her daughter a grown-up doll with a
bosom. "Our guys all said, 'Naw, no good,' " she recalled. "I tried more
than once and nobody was interested, and I gave up."</TE>
<TE>Inspired by German Doll</TE>
<TE>   She let the project idle until 1956 when, during a European vacation,
she spied a German doll called Lilli in a display case. It had a
voluptuous figure, reminiscent of the poster pinups that entertained
soldiers during World War II. Handler brought the doll home to Mattel's
designers and ordered them to draw up plans and find a manufacturer in
Japan who could produce it.</TE>
<TE>   Handler's dream made its debut at the 1959 American Toy Fair in New
York City. Named for her daughter, "Barbie Teen-Age Fashion Model" had a
girl-next-door ponytail, black-and-white striped bathing suit and teeny
feet that fit into open-toed heels. Mattel sold more than 350,000 the
first year, and orders soon backed up for the doll, which retailed for
$3. "The minute that doll hit the counter, she walked right off," Handler
said.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1960s, Mattel had annual sales of $100 million, due
largely to Barbie. The company, then based in Hawthorne, annually turned
out new versions of Barbie as well as an ever-expanding wardrobe of
outfits and accessories befitting the new princess of toydom. Soon enough
Barbie sprouted a coterie of friends and family. Ken, named for the
Handlers' son, appeared in 1961; Midge in 1963; Skipper in 1965; and
African American doll Christie, Barbie's first ethnic friend, in 1969.
The first black Barbie came much later, in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Other dolls were named for Handler's grandchildren, including Stacie,
Todd and Cheryl.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from feminists, Barbie evolved from fashion model to
career woman, including doctor, astronaut, police officer, paramedic,
athlete, veterinarian and teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the toy inspired Barbie clubs, conventions, magazines
and Web sites. Barbie was immortalized by Andy Warhol, preserved in time
capsules and inspired conceptual artists who spiked the doll's hair or
posed it in pickle jars to make statements.</TE>
<TE>   M.G. Lord, author of "Forever Barbie: The Unauthorized Biography of a
Living Doll," called Barbie the most potent icon of American culture of
the late 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   "She's an archetypal female figure, she's something upon which little
girls project their idealized selves," she said. "For most baby boomers,
she has the same iconic resonance as any female saints, although without
the same religious significance."</TE>
<TE>   The National Organization for Women and other feminists targeted
Barbie in the 1970s, arguing that the doll promoted unattainable
expectations for young girls. If Barbie was 5 foot 6 instead of 11 1/2
inches tall, her measurements, would be 39-21-33. An academic expert once
calculated that a woman's likelihood of being shaped like Barbie was less
than 1 in 100,000.</TE>
<TE>   (Ken was shaped somewhat more realistically: The chances of a boy
developing his measurements were said to be 1 in 50.)</TE>
<TE>   Handler said she did not take offense at the feminist broadsides and
often noted that successful women had played with Barbie and told her the
doll helped them enact their aspirations. Even artists' tortured
interpretations of Barbie didn't bother her. "More power to them," said
Handler, who kept a gold-plated Barbie in her Century City high-rise.</TE>
<TE>   "My whole philosophy of Barbie was that through the doll, the little
girl could be anything she wanted to be," Handler wrote in her 1994
autobiography. "Barbie always represented the fact that a woman has
choices."</TE>
<TE>Rare Achievement for Woman of Her Era</TE>
<TE>   Handler herself must have bedeviled feminists. Although Barbie was
mocked as a bimbo, her creator was ahead of most women of her generation,
juggling career and children in the 1950s when the ideal woman was
someone more like the cheerful and industrious television housewife Donna
Reed.</TE>
<TE>   By 1966, Handler was 50 and Mattel ruled the highly competitive toy
world: It controlled 12% of the $2-billion toy market in the United
States. "I had my career, my husband, my children, Barbie and Ken, and I
was on top of the world," Handler recalled.</TE>
<TE>   By 1970, however, her world began to unravel. Handler was diagnosed
with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy. New corporate managers
began to diversify Mattel away from toys, and their machinations
ultimately resulted in the Handlers' ouster from the company they had
founded.</TE>
<TE>   To make matters worse, in 1978 Handler was indicted by a grand jury on
charges of fraud and false reporting to the Securities and Exchange
Commission. She pleaded no contest and was fined $57,000 and sentenced to
2,500 hours of community service.</TE>
<TE>   She later attributed her downfall to her illness, which she said
caused her to be "unfocused" about a massive corporate reorganization she
had begun. When she returned to work after her mastectomy, no one
mentioned the reason she had been gone but many gave her sorrowful looks,
which reduced her to tears.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd been opinionated and outspoken. I had strong leadership skills. I
had been running a company making hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
We had 15,000 employees. I had a big job. But suddenly," she said, "I was
supposed to whisper about what I'd been through."</TE>
<TE>   The experience was so unnerving, she told USA Today in 1994, that "I
was never able to get back in and grab hold of things as I should have."</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, she and her husband were forced out of Mattel. The following
year she founded a new company, but not to make toys.</TE>
<TE>   Ruthton Corp. in Inglewood was the result of the humiliation Handler
experienced when she sought to restore her appearance to its
pre-mastectomy state. Her doctor told her to stuff the empty side of her
bra with a pair of rolled-up stockings. The effect was so awful that
Handler went to a Beverly Hills department store and asked a saleslady
for an artificial breast. She was taken to a dressing room and with no
explanation was handed a surgical bra and a couple of gloves. She
eventually figured out that she was supposed to stuff the bra with the
gloves.</TE>
<TE>A New Concept for Artificial Breasts</TE>
<TE>   She finally found someone who made prosthetic breasts, but they were
little better. "I looked at the shapeless glob that lay in the bottom of
my brassiere and thought, 'My god, the people in this business are men
who don't have to wear these.' " She decided she should manufacture one
herself.</TE>
<TE>   The Nearly Me prosthetic breast was made of liquid silicone enclosed
in polyurethane and had a rigid foam backing. Handler sold it in lefts
and rights according to bra size. Her goal was to make an artificial
breast so real that "a woman could wear a regular brassiere and blouse,
stick her chest out and be proud."</TE>
<TE>   She led a sales team of eight middle-aged women, most breast cancer
survivors, into department stores where they fitted women and trained the
sales staffs. She fit former First Lady Betty Ford after her mastectomy.
Her aggressive tactics included talk-show appearances and handwritten
invitations to breast cancer patients. She also had what she called her
"strip act": She would remove her blouse to demonstrate that no one could
feel or see the difference between her real and prosthetic breast. She
was pictured in People magazine yanking open her blouse to flaunt her
bosom.</TE>
<TE>   By 1980, sales of the Nearly Me artificial breast had surpassed $1
million. In 1991, Handler sold the company to a division of
Kimberly-Clark.</TE>
<TE>   She went on the lecture circuit to promote her product and tell women
about the importance of early detection and regular mammograms.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't make a lot of money in it," she said of the prosthetics
business. "It sure rebuilt my self-esteem, and I think I rebuilt the
self-esteem of others."</TE>
<TE>   Her son Ken died of a brain tumor in 1994. She is survived by her
husband of 63 years; her daughter, Barbara Segal; one brother, Aaron
Mosko of Denver; five grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.</TE>
<TE>   Services are scheduled Tuesday at 2 p.m. at Hillside Memorial Park and
Mortuary, 6001 W. Centinela Ave.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the Stop
Cancer organization, 9171 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills 90212.</TE>

<HD>Graveyard Shift</HD>
<DH>At night in the hospital, the 'Angel of Death' preyed on the
helpless. Finally the 'goody-goody' was one of the bad guys. But as
patients died, talk of his 'magic syringe' spread among fellow
respiratory therapists.</DH>
<SE>The first of two articles.
</SE>
<AU>PAUL LIEBERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Salbi Asatryan was found dead in her bed. It was 4:26 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   An Armenian immigrant, Asatryan, 75, had been rushed to Glendale
Adventist Medical Center three days earlier, on Dec. 27, 1996. She was in
acute respiratory failure and needed a nasal ventilator to help her
breathe.</LD>
<LD>   They put her in Critical Care, bed nine. To Bob Baker, she was "just a
little old lady . . . a little barrel-chested thing, and sweet." He was
one of the respiratory therapists who treated her. She had daughters,
Baker remembered, and they were often by her side. He was surprised by
her death.</LD>
<TE>   "She was doing better," he'd thought. "She was improving."</TE>
<TE>   Elmer Diwa thought so too. He was another respiratory therapist, and
he had seen Asatryan shortly before 1 a.m. She was confused but awake by
then--off the ventilator, able to breathe on her own.</TE>
<TE>   When Baker and Diwa got off work, they liked to have a smoke and
gossip before getting into their cars. This time they talked about their
golf games, then got around to the woman in bed nine. In the underground
parking garage, as daylight broke outside, Diwa offered an explanation
for her death.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't you know about Efren and his magic syringe?"</TE>
<TE>   A hospital becomes a different place at night. The visiting families
go home. So do the administrators. Most of the doctors go too. That
leaves the patients and the staff, alone with each other. "Lights off and
quiet" is how Efren Saldivar described the graveyard shift.</TE>
<TE>   Night was when the gloom in the sickrooms matched the horrors of his
mind.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar compared what he was doing to shoplifting a stick of gum.
Once you've done it, "you don't think about it for the rest of the day,"
he said, "or ever." He couldn't even say how often he'd done it. He "lost
count."</TE>
<TE>   Long before authorities began digging up bodies, others suspected what
he was doing in the darkness. They whispered about it, even joked about
it. By the time the truth reached the light of day, it was too late for
many.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SALDIVAR WAS ONCE asked whether he became a respiratory therapist
because he wanted to take care of people.</TE>
<TE>   "No," he replied. He liked the uniform.</TE>
<TE>   He was born Sept. 30, 1969, in Brownsville, Texas, not far from where
the Rio Grande meets the Gulf of Mexico. Raised in Mexico, his mother,
Isaura Saldivar, liked to say that she "jumped across the river" when she
became pregnant so her son would be a U.S. citizen. She gave birth at the
home of a midwife, who signed Efren's birth certificate with an X.</TE>
<TE>   His parents, Isaura, then 20, and Alfredo, 31, followed a classic
route for immigrants, heading toward jobs and a better place to raise a
family. Their son was not yet 2 when they moved to the Los Angeles area
and bought a wood-frame bungalow in Tujunga in the foothills of the San
Gabriel Mountains. The backyard had enough room for chickens.</TE>
<TE>   Efren's father worked as a plasterer and handyman, operating out of a
battered pickup. His mother also worked with her hands, as a seamstress
making dresses. But she had higher aspirations for the family. A
Jehovah's Witness, she insisted that the children be raised in the faith
that believed in salvation through good works and door-to-door
proselytizing. She liked dressing everyone up on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Though the couple spoke Spanish at home, their two boys grew up
bilingual, picking up English from TV and from other kids in the
neighborhood. The younger son, Eduardo, went by Eddie.</TE>
<TE>   Childhood photos show Efren as a clean-cut boy, cherubic in his
earliest years, if sad-eyed at times. His father was a wiry 5-foot-6 and
his brother was slight too, but Efren was taller than average and hefty,
with a soft, round face.</TE>
<TE>   While he was at Pinewood Elementary School, teachers praised his
"outgoing personality" and found him "pleasant" and "delightful,"
although one worried that he was naive, too sheltered. He enjoyed
painting and showed an aptitude for math, scoring higher than the 90th
percentile on some tests.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he didn't always put his mind to his studies. He admitted that he
was lazy in those lower grades. He wrote in a self-evaluation a few years
later: "I never did any classwork nor homework."</TE>
<TE>   But fail? Never.</TE>
<TE>   "Because I'm a goody-goody."</TE>
<TE>   In seventh grade, when he was 12, he stepped on a nail. It sliced the
outside of his left foot and pushed his little toe out of alignment. He
spent several weeks at County-USC Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   While there, he wrote a composition he called "Some Experiences in My
Life." He mentioned that he was sewing a canvas backpack and learning to
play the oboe, but the essay was mostly about his experience in the
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "My doctor inserted a long surgical steel wire lining up all the small
bones of my little toe," he reported. "The doctors inserted a needle to
withdraw the infection (pus). When I came to the hospital, I was in
shock. I trembled. They gave me a shot to calm me and numb my senses. My
skin surface went to sleep, but under this surface I was still in pain."</TE>
<TE>   As an adult, he would describe himself the same way--as one thing on
the surface and something else within.</TE>
<TE>   As a kid in the hospital, he wrote: "I will be very glad to go home."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE SAME DAY Salbi Asatryan was found dead in her bed, Eleanora
Schlegel arrived at Glendale Adventist.</TE>
<TE>   She had been there before and liked it so much that she had asked to
be taken to the 450-bed hospital that looms over the Ventura Freeway at
the base of the Verdugo Mountains. Some rooms have views all the way to
downtown Los Angeles, a dozen miles away.</TE>
<TE>   After an ambulance dropped her off, Schlegel was "alert and coherent."
But she was 77, and she was not in good shape. She suffered from multiple
sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and, most pressingly,
pneumonia.</TE>
<TE>   Going to the hospital had become so routine that she sometimes did not
tell her son, Larry. She figured that hospital personnel would get her
breathing OK and that she would get out soon enough. Then she could tell
him, and say, "Everything's fine."</TE>
<TE>   If they could not get her breathing back to normal . . . well, she
asked to be classified as a no-code, a DNR, "Do Not Resuscitate."</TE>
<TE>   It exasperated Larry Schlegel that his mother would go to the hospital
without letting him know. He was someone who didn't take family for
granted.</TE>
<TE>   Eleanora and her husband had adopted Larry in 1951. He was their only
child.</TE>
<TE>   When Larry was 12, his adoptive father dropped dead while they were
hiking by a lake. Larry had to go back and tell his mom. It was only the
two of them after that.</TE>
<TE>   When he heard that she was at Glendale Adventist, he went to see her.
He was relieved--she was not choking or struggling to talk. She was
speaking of going home.</TE>
<TE>   But that was not realistic. It was New Year's Eve. Even if the doctors
gave the go-ahead, Pasadena would be a zoo with the Rose Parade and Rose
Bowl football game. "So we decided it would be OK if she stayed in the
hospital a couple of days more," Larry said.</TE>
<TE>   They ended their visit with a toast: "Hopefully next year will be
better."</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, Larry got home early to let in deliverymen bringing a
new sofa and love seat. He found a message on his answering machine.</TE>
<TE>   It was from the hospital, about his mother.</TE>
<TE>   The morning staff had checked on her at 7:15 a.m., shortly after they
arrived. She had died of "acute respiratory failure."</TE>
<TE>   Sometime during the night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   EFREN SALDIVAR, THE goody-goody, wanted to be bad.</TE>
<TE>   When he was still in junior high, he watched enviously as older gang
kids hung around outside Verdugo Hills, the nearby high school.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd purposely walk by," Saldivar would recall much later during a
long evening in a police cubicle. "For three years, I would see . . . the
cholos doing drugs and looking cool and being tough. I just couldn't wait
to get there. And when I finally got there, they were all gone. . . .
That was like an aspiration gone down the drain."</TE>
<TE>   This was a touch of dry humor, of course. He was anything but a
candidate for the gangs. He was the doughy dork who played the oboe.</TE>
<TE>   He weighed 170 pounds when he reached the ninth grade, so everyone
wanted to know if he would play football. Verdugo Hills High drew many
bused-in students, and neighborhood kids in Tujunga were under pressure
to uphold local honor. He declined. "I wasn't into sports," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he could be one of the brains. He hung out with the good
students and acted as if he got A's along with the rest of them. In
truth, he languished at about the middle of his class.</TE>
<TE>   He was a Latino, but in an assimilated crowd with the likes of Will
Reinhart, who was half-Puerto Rican and went on to UCLA, then returned to
Verdugo Hills High to teach Advanced Placement government classes. They
listened to mainstream rock, say on KROQ, not banda or hip-hop.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't trace our ancestors to the Mayflower, but we were pretty
much white kids," Reinhart said. "He'd definitely be out there with us,
on a Friday night, bowling."</TE>
<TE>   Could Saldivar pass for preppy? He blow-dried his hair to the side and
wore sport shirts with long sleeves, carefully folding them halfway up
his forearms. But he was "Kmart stylish," remembered Andrew Jones,
another schoolmate. "Just not that 'there.' . . . Off-brand shoes and
stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar was among 50 seniors chosen for the Knights &amp; Ladies club,
whose motto was "service with a smile." They organized blood drives and
sang Christmas carols at an old folks home. Though he was usually a shy
figure on the fringe, Saldivar did try to be noticed--often too hard. He
offered lame jokes that made others laugh at him, not with him.</TE>
<TE>   He had little luck with girls, often becoming obsessed with ones who
were "out of his league," friends said. Reinhart recalled several saying
that he had sent them "strange love letters with unusual descriptions and
fantasies.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be an Efren moment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones noticed how Saldivar sometimes gravitated to an "off group,"
perhaps at lunch, when "you could see him entertaining two or three
people you really didn't want to be around. He did have some
leadership-type skills among the bottom feeders."</TE>
<TE>   In high school, Saldivar was asked to list his plans, and he went all
over the map: maybe industrial engineering, maybe working with machine
tools, maybe studying math, or maybe enlisting in the military, then
going to college.</TE>
<TE>   This much he sensed: "I'd rather work alone because I am easily
disrupted." He saw himself as an employee, not a boss. "I won't argue
back." "I'm never in charge." He preferred working "with things" instead
of people. If events didn't go his way, he would not get angry, he said,
but would "simply accept the fact that I was denied of something and let
it be."</TE>
<TE>   He got a part-time job at a Vons supermarket and tried to impress his
friends by sneaking out six-packs of a new product, super-caffeinated
Jolt cola. He told classmates that he could not make graduation because
of a conflict with a Vons training program in butchering. In reality, he
had not completed his assignments in an English composition class.</TE>
<TE>   Even after a warning that he might fail, he didn't do all the work.</TE>
<TE>   So he did fail, and he did not graduate.</TE>
<TE>   It was 1987. While others went on to college, he stayed at Vons. His
oldest friend began suggesting he try something else. Carlos DeLeon's
mother used to baby-sit Efren. Carlos had enrolled in a trade school in
North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "I was happily working at Vons," as Saldivar told it, "and he comes
over, 'Efren, Efren, want to join?' And I would turn him down.</TE>
<TE>   "The third time he came in, he showed up in uniform, you know, with
stethoscope, badge and patch.</TE>
<TE>   "And I go, 'Damn, that looks cool. I'll join whatever it is.' "</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar entered the College of Medical and Dental Careers in May
1988, and also obtained his high school equivalency certificate. He
finished his 1,200 hours of training by Feb. 10, 1989. So what if the
diploma spelled his name "Efrin Saldibar." He had a job waiting down the
foothills, in Glendale, 15 minutes from home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE SAME DAY Eleanora Schlegel was found dead in her bed, Jose Alfaro
Sr. arrived at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Alfaro grew up in the Philippines, where he fought in World War II and
survived the Bataan Death March, when Japanese soldiers led American and
Filipino prisoners on a trek that killed thousands.</TE>
<TE>   He drove a bus in the Philippines until emphysema forced his
retirement. In 1992, he followed his children to the United States. The
government was offering instant citizenship to Filipino veterans who had
helped the Allied cause.</TE>
<TE>   By 1997, Alfaro was 82 and living in a nursing home, battling
pulmonary and arterial disease. When he was admitted to Glendale
Adventist on Jan. 2, he had severe pneumonia. His family asked that no
heroic measures be taken.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, Alfaro died. Time: 9:10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SALDIVAR WAS 19 when he got his own uniform and stethoscope.</TE>
<TE>   He slipped needles into patients' arteries to be sure they had enough
oxygen in their blood. He put them through exercises to get them
breathing normally after they came out of anesthesia. He helped insert
breathing tubes down the throats of patients in respiratory distress and
adjusted the ventilators that kept others alive.</TE>
<TE>   However flippant his reason for becoming a respiratory therapist,
Saldivar learned how exhilarating the work could be. People would come in
wheezing, and he'd suction their airways, administer sprays and sit
beside them "talking to them, you know, while the medication takes effect
and they start opening up."</TE>
<TE>   The pay wasn't bad, either--twice the $9 an hour he had made at Vons.</TE>
<TE>   He once had envisioned himself tending machines in a factory, and in a
sense he was. His hospital job was punch-the-clock shift work. He didn't
mind working nights, even the graveyard shift, which went overnight to 7
a.m. That was where he settled. "Mornings for me," he said, "are sleep."</TE>
<TE>   He once said he'd "rather work alone," and he almost did. On
graveyard, only two respiratory therapists were on duty. Their patients
were everywhere in the hospital, and the two had the run of the place. An
assignment board told them which patients needed what therapies, and they
might treat 20 a shift.</TE>
<TE>   They also helped when nurses called a Code Blue emergency, or when
heart monitors or respirators signaled trouble. There were frantic nights
when three people died, or more. "A lot of people died," Saldivar said.</TE>
<TE>   Other nights were uneventful--as quiet, indeed, as a graveyard.</TE>
<TE>   It was a good shift for moonlighting. Saldivar got extra work at
Methodist Hospital of Southern California in Arcadia, then at Glendale
Memorial. He worked part time for Schaefer Ambulance Service, then at
convalescent homes and Pacifica Hospital of the Valley. Some co-workers
thought he was less than diligent, but he might have been simply tired.
By most accounts, he was competent.</TE>
<TE>   He got regular raises, thank-you notes from patients and a "Golden
Cookie Award," worth two treats in the cafeteria.</TE>
<TE>   Some of his fellow respiratory therapists could see that he was smart.
One RT called him a "brainiac" and marveled at how he mastered the
details of diseases. She heard him talk with doctors about how certain
drugs stayed in the body longer if the patient had liver failure.</TE>
<TE>   Many sought his help with computers. He could install software, even
grasped operating systems. "They don't understand the difference between
DOS and Windows," Saldivar said of his colleagues. "I'm a genius in their
eyes."</TE>
<TE>   He took to languages, picking up enough Tagalog to banter with the
Filipino RTs and nurses, especially the women. The first words he learned
were ones that made them blush. He still had not figured out how to deal
with women. He tried too hard, or said the wrong thing, like boasting
about "how much he was getting." He would grow infatuated with one nurse
or another, only to wind up getting nowhere or dumped.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the kind of guy who, if there was a spare moment, would rub
your shoulders if you were charting," recalled Diane Jansen, a night
nurse in Critical Care. "He'd be like, 'How about if I rub your
shoulders? Are you tired?' "</TE>
<TE>   His behavior didn't strike her as sleazy, though. She decided he was
merely awkward. "He seemed at times to be a little short for words," she
said. "If he didn't have a word, he'd just stop--and it wouldn't come
out."</TE>
<TE>   He told her he was working all those extra hours to help his family.
Saldivar bought his younger brother a 1968 Mustang and assembled an
engine for it, a Cobra 351. He was getting a car for his mother too, a
little blue Ford. For himself? Just a Honda Civic.</TE>
<TE>   He and Jansen went to the movies. "I wouldn't call it dating," she
said. "He would, like, drive me to the airport. It makes it sound like I
was using him, but he was more than willing."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, he was unfailingly helpful. "I had a blind cat, and I would
leave town for ski trips or holiday vacations, and he would watch my
cat," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "One day, my neighbor said, 'What's up with the guy who puts on the
white suit and the mask and the gloves to go into your apartment?'</TE>
<TE>   "I asked Efren, and he said, 'I'm deathly allergic to cats.'</TE>
<TE>   "That's the kind of guy he was. He would probably step out in front of
a train to keep you from getting hurt."</TE>
<TE>   On graveyard, Saldivar took his "lunch" from midnight to 12:30 a.m.,
and he had another break between 2 and 2:30 a.m., when he could take a
nap if he wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Or he could roam the halls.</TE>
<TE>   "It would not stand out in anybody's memory," he said. "On certain
shifts, at certain times . . . there's not--nobody walking around. . . .
There's no way to know who's walking down this hallway here and into a
room.</TE>
<TE>   "So you come into the room, and go back out. . . ."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   JEAN COYLE WAS an exception. Usually RTs could not recall patients'
names. They came and went in a blur. But who could forget a patient who
was always pushing her bedside button?</TE>
<TE>   "My mom would stand out," said Michelle Elmore, Coyle's daughter.
"She's kind of a complainer. 'I need a breathing treatment. I need this.
I need that.' "</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Coyle had earned the right to complain. She had raised four
children on her own while working, most recently as a "self-employed
house cleaner"--a maid. Then she developed emphysema. It kept her in a
wheelchair, and she was in and out of Glendale Adventist dozens of times.
Now she was back, in February 1997, pushing the button by her bed.</TE>
<TE>   Down in the RT department, Saldivar would say: "She's calling again?"</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes she merely wanted company. Coyle liked the RTs. "They were
all nice," she said. She knew many of them, from the "Filipino guys" to
"Ursula," who often worked graveyard with Saldivar. Coyle remembered
Efren because he talked about his family and because of his size, a
little over 6 feet and by now more than 220 pounds, maybe 250. The
roundness of his face was accentuated by oval, wire-rim eyeglasses.</TE>
<TE>   Although it was dark, she couldn't mistake the figure that approached
her bed during the early morning of Feb. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Then, she recalled, "I blacked out."</TE>
<TE>   Her daughter got a call that night. "They said, 'Your mom, she's
turned blue. But she's OK now. Don't worry.' "</TE>
<TE>   Neither mother nor daughter gave the episode a second thought. Coyle
had gone to the edge before, and might well again. Elmore was just
thankful that her mother was alive.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THEY LIKED TO PLAY.</TE>
<TE>   Respiratory therapists--day or night--were like high school kids. They
could be grinds. They could be cutups. They formed cliques and rivalries.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar fell in with the cutups. They might use syringes as water
pistols, or drop their pants and moon each other.</TE>
<TE>   The RTs worked out of a cluster of rooms on the second floor of the
hospital. It was their world apart, with locker rooms for men and women,
a lounge and laboratories, offices for their bosses, a "dirty room" for
used implements and a large report room with the assignment board.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar used the board to play pranks. He knew that Bob Baker
relished working the tough cases in Critical Care, so he would move
Baker's name, putting it next to patients at all ends of the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Baker was still mulling over what to do about what his smoking buddy
Elmer Diwa had said in the garage, months earlier, about Saldivar's
"magic syringe."</TE>
<TE>   Diwa was a friend of Saldivar's. Why would he say such a thing about a
friend? "I was wondering, 'Is this BS, or is this the truth?' " Baker
said.</TE>
<TE>   He had been on the job 18 years and had learned a few lessons. One
was, "There's a lot of loose talk around the hospital. . . . People joke
about things." Another was, "You don't report all gossip."</TE>
<TE>   He couldn't even remember the name of the patient who had gotten them
talking, just that she was found dead in bed nine of the Critical Care
Unit on a busy night around Christmas 1996 when they'd had to call in a
third therapist--Efren Saldivar--for half a shift of overtime.</TE>
<TE>   But Baker could not distance himself from death. His first wife was
diagnosed with terminal cancer when she was just 19, and pregnant. Their
son was delivered by caesarean section days before she died. When he
decided to get into health care shortly after, it wasn't because of the
uniform.</TE>
<TE>   In April 1997, Baker finally told his boss about the magic syringe.</TE>
<TE>   John Bechthold, head of the pulmonary department, knew what he had to
do--tell his own bosses. But that's about all that was easy.</TE>
<TE>   It was no secret that Baker and Saldivar did not get along. Sometimes
Saldivar called Baker "Bob Bozo." And Baker's opinion of Saldivar?
"Everyone knows I think he's a jerk and a spaz."</TE>
<TE>   Now one was accusing the other of murder.</TE>
<TE>   Bechthold and another supervisor kept an eye on Saldivar for a few
weeks. They also tallied the deaths on his shifts over a year or so and
compared them to the number of deaths at other times. As best they could
see, there was "nothing unusual."</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar was never even told of the "magic syringe" rumor. He just
kept working graveyard.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MYRTLE BROWER, WHO was mentally retarded, was supposed to die at home,
surrounded by her family, who had cared for her for 84 years.</TE>
<TE>   She had never grown beyond the capacity of a 10-year-old, and she
lived with her parents until they died. Then she was taken in by her
older sister, Thelma Wheeler, and her husband, Chet, in Van Nuys. They
looked after her for 50 years, although it was not easy having a child
around in an adult's body. Into middle age, they would dress Myrtle up
when relatives came over, only to have her get dirty playing
hide-and-seek with the kids.</TE>
<TE>   Chet died first. Then Thelma got cancer. When she was told at age 87
that she was dying, her concern was for her sister. By then, Myrtle was
bedridden herself, after several strokes.</TE>
<TE>   Thelma did not want Myrtle sent to an institution.</TE>
<TE>   "She said, 'This is Myrtle's home. She spent her whole life here, and
I want her to die here,' " recalled the sisters' great-niece, Vickie
Lowery, who promised to see that the wish was carried out.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 2, 1997, Thelma died.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks afterward, Myrtle was taken to Glendale Adventist. It wasn't
an emergency. Her great-niece thought her ingrown toenails should be
removed, as well as some of her teeth. In addition, a psychiatrist
thought antidepressants might help her. They did.</TE>
<TE>   Then Myrtle had another stroke. By Aug. 28, she was on oxygen. Lowery
had her classified "no code" and stayed with her into the night, singing
hymns and lullabies and reading Scripture to her.</TE>
<TE>   Then Lowery left.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple of hours later, I get the phone call." Myrtle had died. It
was 5:12 a.m., not yet sunup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE WERE MANY deaths--four more that night alone. Occasionally, a
crude piece of artwork appeared on the assignment board. It was a
cartoon-like face with Xs for eyes, a mouth turned into a frown and an
elongated tongue hanging out.</TE>
<TE>   Another one bit the dust. Graveyard humor.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar insisted that others had drawn the faces first, and he only
copied them. He did find it a crackup, though, much like watching "The
Munsters" and "The Addams Family" on TV.</TE>
<TE>   "Morbid humor," he said, "was always pretty funny to me."</TE>
<TE>   When he started at the hospital, he enjoyed the joking of a veteran
RT, who would end shifts by announcing, " 'Oh, these three patients are
no more . . . no more therapies for us.'</TE>
<TE>   "And I go, 'Hey, you killed 'em off.' "</TE>
<TE>   Someone else would tease the older RT, "You've got the magic touch."</TE>
<TE>   Soon enough, they were teasing Saldivar.</TE>
<TE>   Jhun Tana, a fellow respiratory therapist, recalled how a member of
the crew would ask, " 'Oh, is Efren on tonight?'</TE>
<TE>   "And I'm like, 'Oh, no, he's off.'</TE>
<TE>   "And they said, 'Oh, good, you know, because, uh, he's a jinx.' "</TE>
<TE>   One of the women noticed how Saldivar would walk past the Filipino RTs
and say, "Patay!" "Patay!"--Tagalog for "dead." Outsiders wouldn't
understand.</TE>
<TE>   Their joking was not all that the RTs reserved for their little world.</TE>
<TE>   "We have discussions," Tana said later. "I mean, we look at the board,
and we say, 'OK, this person's been here for a long time.' . . . It's
probably--well, what's the right word?--horrible. You know, I mean saying
that, 'OK, well, you know, this patient needs to die.'</TE>
<TE>   "It's nearly impossible not to have that conversation."</TE>
<TE>   On went those conversations, along with the joking, "Hey, Efren, did
you go visit this patient?"</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar didn't mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been such a good boy, I wanted to think of myself as a
bad boy," he would later confess. "So this was like the prophecy that,
eventually, I guess, became true."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THEY STUMBLED ONTO the drugs during a Thursday graveyard.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar had the night off. Baker was working it with Tana, and they
were pulling a practical joke on Kim Gardemann. One pried open
Gardemann's locker with a screwdriver, while the other slid in a coat
hanger to spring the latch. They took everything out and booby-trapped
it.</TE>
<TE>   When Gardemann came to work in the morning and opened the locker, a
slingshot would spew pancake batter onto his chest.</TE>
<TE>   They booby-trapped the bathroom as well, so water would spritz up when
he turned on the faucet. They put more water atop the towels. When he
reached up for one, he'd get soaked again.</TE>
<TE>   Then Baker thought: Why not get two for the price of one?</TE>
<TE>   Why not open Saldivar's locker too, and put Gardemann's gear in there?
So they forced open the locker and piled in Gardemann's clothes. They did
it so fast, Baker said, that he did not notice what was inside.</TE>
<TE>   The Gardemann part of the prank worked.</TE>
<TE>   But Saldivar was off the next three nights, and Baker began feeling
guilty. Sunday night, paired this time with Elmer Diwa, his smoking
buddy, he broke into Saldivar's locker a second time to retrieve
Gardemann's things. "That's when we noticed the bag," Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   It hung from a hook, and it didn't contain Saldivar's usual herbal
supplements, or vitamins, or the dietary aids he took to lose weight. It
bulged with drugs. Among them were vials of morphine.</TE>
<TE>   An RT would never be authorized to have a narcotic like that. Baker
wondered if Saldivar was using it to get high.</TE>
<TE>   Then he looked at the top shelf. It was at eye level. On the left was
an empty syringe. On the right were two vials.</TE>
<TE>   He recognized the orangish label.</TE>
<TE>   Succinylcholine chloride. "Succs," the RTs called it. Doctors and
nurses injected it to keep patients from biting or gagging when they had
to insert a breathing tube down their throats.</TE>
<TE>   It suppressed breathing. It paralyzed the patient.</TE>
<TE>   It was then, Baker said, that it hit him. "This is all probably true."</TE>
<TE>   But what to do? He could get into trouble for breaking into the
lockers. He could be fired. So could the RTs who'd helped him. Then he
thought: "Look what they did with the original information I gave them."</TE>
<TE>   So he would not tell the bosses what he had seen.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody told them, even as word spread among the RTs. It was hard to
keep a great prank like that secret. Inevitably, Saldivar heard what had
happened.</TE>
<TE>   Jhun Tana said Saldivar confronted him in the "dirty room."</TE>
<TE>   "I was washing my hands or whatever. . . . He said, 'Hey, Jhun. Um,
when you opened my locker, who else was there?'</TE>
<TE>   "Well, 'Bob and I was there.'</TE>
<TE>   "And he said, 'Who else was in there?' Just like--kind of like kept
insisting. 'Who else was there?' "</TE>
<TE>   In their world, Saldivar was not the one who had explaining to do.
Tana recalled: "I said, 'I'm sorry we opened your locker. . . . I just
said, 'Well, I'm sorry.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SALDIVAR HAD ONCE tried seeing a psychiatrist.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always depressed," he would say later. "Any time somebody comes
in my face, I put a happy face on: 'Hey, what's up?' and this and that,
you know? But that's basically a show.' "</TE>
<TE>   He found himself moping, locking himself in his room. He was no kid,
now closer to 30 than 20, but he still lived with his parents. They would
be outside puttering, Alfredo, with his lined laborer's face, tending the
chickens, and Isaura in the yard with a shovel, digging out weeds. And he
would be in his room, smaller than some people's closets, playing on the
Internet, using fake names. He had his own TV and a VCR and dozens of
videotapes under his bed that he hoped his mother would never see.</TE>
<TE>   He had been so neat in high school, but now his shirt bunched around
his belly. His hair was mussed. He had a double chin. He tried the
fen-phen diet drugs to lose weight. He bought a bicycle, fancy shorts,
gloves and a helmet. He would pedal a couple of laps around the park,
then stop and eat a candy bar.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the RTs went out for breakfast. Diwa watched Saldivar order
four or five eggs and chicken-fried steak.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't you think that thing gonna kill you?" Diwa asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care," Saldivar replied.</TE>
<TE>   He thought he was going to marry one nurse, but she moved away. He
told his brother he was thinking of driving his car off a cliff and
leaving him his computer.</TE>
<TE>   "Ain't no girl worth it," Eddie replied.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar's psychiatrist prescribed Zoloft, an antidepressant.</TE>
<TE>   "It helped," Saldivar said. So did smoking pot.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there was something about misery. It wasn't exactly a friend, but
it was a companion. "I missed it," he said. "It was--I carried it for
such a long time, and being miserable--I missed it. I can't explain it."</TE>
<TE>   So he stopped taking the drug that made his misery go away.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HE DID FEEL better with Ursula.</TE>
<TE>   Ursula Anderson had landed on graveyard with him in 1995. They were
paired about two times a week, for 12-hour shifts. She was petite and
exotic, part Native American. She dressed primly, like an Avon lady. She
had two kids at home.</TE>
<TE>   They couldn't lock the doors of the department. But in the middle of
the night, who was going to barge in? They began their affair in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   When "Urs" was around, patients didn't concern Saldivar as much. "I
preferred spending time with her," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When she asked about a rumor that Bob Baker had found drugs in his
locker, he had an explanation: Baker had planted them.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob doesn't like me," Saldivar said. "He thinks I did something to
his patient."</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar and Anderson sometimes saw each other outside the hospital
too. Many of the RTs socialized on the outside. Some went to a golf range
together. Others went fishing. One had a boat. Sometimes they simply went
out for drinks, like co-workers in any office. They would make small talk
and dance and maybe get drunk.</TE>
<TE>   A few times, Ursula brought along an old friend and introduced him
around. He looked nothing like the hospital crowd. His face was puffy,
lined beyond his 30-some years. He wore his jet-black hair in the style
of a '50s greaser, curled into a pompadour. Sometimes he dressed in
black, with a military dog tag hanging from his neck. He was
barrel-chested, thick all over. He looked in his element in a bar, like
he'd been in a bar fight or two.</TE>
<TE>   His name was Grant Brossus, and he had been in bar fights--he killed a
man in one. He had done time. Not for the killing--that was self-defense.
Cocaine was his bugaboo, and alcohol. He had a taste for White Russians,
whose placid surface of cream hid a potent blend of vodka and Kahlua.</TE>
<TE>   He was the first to say, "I'm a terrible witness."</TE>
<TE>   All he had was barroom gossip. He wasn't even sure where he'd heard
it, though he guessed it was at Q's, a sports bar in Pasadena. He vaguely
remembered playing pool there the night Ursula Anderson blurted out
something about one of the fellows at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Brossus could not even recall the man's name. Only this stayed with
him: "A remark was made like, 'Somebody in the hospital's playing Dr.
Kevorkian.'</TE>
<TE>   "I was like, 'What?'</TE>
<TE>   " 'Yeah, there's terminally ill patients, and they're putting them
under.'</TE>
<TE>   "I'm like, '. . . Is that something that the patients ask for?'</TE>
<TE>   "And then she just totally backed up. You know, it must have been the
way I worded it, or something, that scared her off."</TE>
<TE>   That was all he had, a few words over drinks, quickly retracted. He
too had to mull it over, for weeks or months--he wasn't sure how long.</TE>
<TE>   Then he had a "brilliant idea."</TE>
<TE>   A hospital would appreciate knowing that it might have one of those
"Angels of Death" on the loose. He figured that it would be especially
appreciative if given the opportunity to handle the matter on its own.
With no publicity, no police. Absolutely no police.</TE>
<TE>   That had to be worth something, right? Maybe, say, $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   If it sounded a bit like blackmail, well, what's illegal about a
reward? "An enterprising proposition" was how he put it.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 16, 1998, Brossus called Glendale Adventist Medical Center and
asked for the person in charge--nobody else would do. He had information
to share.</TE>
<TE>   It had been more than a year since the sweet Armenian woman was found
dead in bed nine and 10 months since Bob Baker told his boss about
Efren's magic syringe.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is a strange thing," Brossus would marvel much later, after
he saw what he had set in motion--he, Grant Brossus, an ex-con just
looking to make a buck.</TE>
<TE>   His call put the cops he wanted no part of on the trail of the
respiratory therapist he couldn't name.</TE>

<HD>Greene Out as President of Grammys</HD>
<DH>Music: Resignation comes after emergency board meeting to review
probe of his behavior.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>C. Michael Greene, the executive who transformed the Grammy Music
Awards from a minor industry ritual into a global television event,
resigned Saturday night amid questions over his personal behavior and his
leadership at the organization, Grammy sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Greene's resignation as president took place during an emergency board
meeting at the Beverly Hilton Hotel to discuss a sexual harassment probe
commissioned by the Grammy organization, the sources said.</LD>
<LD>   It was unclear, however, precisely what prompted Greene's sudden
departure.</LD>
<TE>   The extraordinary gathering was attended by 38 Grammy trustees who
flew in from 12 chapters across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Greene, who had three years left on his contract, will exit the
organization with as much as an $8-million severance buyout, Grammy
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The 52-year-old Greene was unavailable for comment. Representatives
for the National Assn. of Recording Arts and Sciences, the Santa
Monica-based nonprofit group that stages the popular annual Grammy
telecast, also could not be reached late Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   During his 14-year reign as Grammy president, Greene became one of the
most powerful and controversial figures in the music industry.</TE>
<TE>   The Grammy Awards offer record companies worldwide exposure that can
be worth millions of dollars in additional album sales. Winning a Grammy
helps boost music sales, as does a performance by musicians on the
telecast. Greene was instrumental in deciding which acts received the
coveted TV performance slots and which judges were picked for the
blue-ribbon awards panels.</TE>
<TE>   Greene came under renewed scrutiny in February when Grammy trustees
paid a former female Grammy executive $650,000 to settle allegations of
sexual abuse against Greene.</TE>
<TE>   Greene said he had never sexually harassed anyone at the academy, but
said he chose not to fight the payout because he did not want to disrupt
the organization.</TE>
<TE>   After that case, the board hired veteran private detective Jack
Palladino to investigate further. Palladino's firm spent several months
interviewing dozens of former Grammy employees and put together a lengthy
report, which was delivered several weeks ago to an advisory committee
run by Grammy Chairman Garth Fundis, Grammy sources said. Fundis is a
Nashville record producer who is an unpaid Grammy volunteer.</TE>
<TE>   Discussions between lawyers representing Greene and the academy grew
tense last week after Greene learned that Fundis planned to fly in most
of the 42-member board for an emergency trustee meeting on Saturday to
address the report's findings.</TE>
<TE>Greene Warning of Suit Limited Disclosures</TE>
<TE>   In the days leading up to the meeting, Greene's attorneys warned the
academy that he might sue if any information from the report became
public, Grammy sources said. As a result, the advisory committee decided
to take the precautionary step of disclosing only selected findings to
the board.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, lawyers for Greene and the academy began to discuss his
possible resignation. By late Friday night, they had reached an
agreement, subject to board approval.</TE>
<TE>   The Saturday meeting started at noon and ran until about 8 p.m., and
included a brief synopsis of the sexual harassment probe, for which
Greene was present. After the findings, Greene gave an emotional
resignation speech in which he cited philosophical differences with the
Grammy board and did not want to drag the organization through nasty
litigation, according to Grammy sources close to the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   A lengthy discussion followed Greene's speech, in which some board
members voiced their support for the embattled executive. But the board
ultimately accepted his resignation, Grammy sources said.</TE>
<TE>   After Greene left the room, the board voted to approve his severance
package.</TE>
<TE>   Greene's exit marks the end of an era at the Grammys--a nonprofit
organization that had become inextricably linked to his own strong
personality. His compensation package last year exceeded $2
million--nearly four times what the academy's philanthropic arm dispersed
to indigent artists--and his job perquisites included an annual
membership in the exclusive Bel-Air Country Club and a leased Mercedes
sedan.</TE>
<TE>   The shake-up signals a new direction on the part of the academy's
board. In recent months, Greene's alleged behavior sparked a boardroom
revolt led by Grammy Chairman Fundis.</TE>
<TE>   Greene's resignation follows a year of controversy during which he was
accused of assaulting and sexually harassing a female executive who ran
the Grammy's human resources department.</TE>
<TE>   Last July attorneys for the Grammy executive, Jill Marie Geimer,
threatened to sue the academy, and raised allegations of physical, sexual
and psychological abuse by Greene over a one-year period.</TE>
<TE>   In September, attorneys for the academy said Geimer was lying and that
Greene "'never touched her." Several months later, Grammy trustees paid
Geimer to resolve the case following a settlement conference at which her
lawyers presented accusations involving at least two other female
executives whom Greene allegedly harassed and forced out of the
organization during the mid-1990s, according to Grammy sources.</TE>
<TE>   Greene broke into the music industry in the 1970s as a saxophonist and
worked at recording studios and cable TV stations before joining the
Grammy organization in 1985 as an unpaid Atlanta chapter president. In
1988, he moved to Los Angeles and took over as Grammy president and chief
executive.</TE>
<TE>14-Year Tenure Saw Tremendous Growth</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure, Greene presided over a period of tremendous growth
at the academy. When he took over, the organization had 14 employees,
3,500 members, and $4.9 million in assets. The Grammy organization
currently has about 120 staffers, 17,000 members, and more than $50
million in assets.</TE>
<TE>   On Greene's watch, the TV rights to the Grammy Awards show rose
dramatically in value. Several months ago, he negotiated another
five-year extension of the broadcast rights with CBS for more than $20
million annually.</TE>
<TE>   The board rewarded Greene handsomely for his efforts. Last year, he
was the highest-paid nonprofit executive in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, over the years, Greene faced questions about his
management style. A series of articles in The Times disclosed internal
complaints about the work environment at the Grammy organization and
revealed that the group consistently overstated the scale of its
philanthropic activities. MusiCares, one of the group's philanthropic
arms, has typically spent three times as much on administration and
fund-raising as it disburses to the needy, according to tax records.</TE>
<TE>   Employees said turnover at the academy's two charitable arms was high
and suffered from an exodus of top executives forced out by Greene.</TE>
<TE>   Greene's last year at the Grammys was plagued by other problems.</TE>
<TE>   In August, he weathered protests by political leaders in Miami about
the Latin Grammy Awards there. Then, at the last minute, Greene decided
to move the show back to Los Angeles--at great expense to the academy.
The nonprofit group lost even more money when the show's planned Sept. 11
telecast was canceled following terrorist attacks on New York and the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Greene was sued by music industry legend Dick Clark, who
claimed the Grammy chief threatened artists not to perform on Clark's
American Music Awards. And in February, Greene was booed when he was on
international television while giving an anti-pirating speech during the
2002 Grammy Awards telecast, which had its lowest TV viewer ratings in a
decade.</TE>
<TE>   The Grammy organization will start the search for a new president
immediately. In the meantime, Fundis will take over the reins at the
nonprofit academy.</TE>

<HD>Light of Disaster Shows One NY Cop Who He Is</HD>
<DH>Recovery: Bearing witness to the fragility of life reminds

<BD>FOR THE ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>A few nights after the Sept. 11 attacks, a woman on North Moore
Street took one look at me in my dirty uniform, started crying, and
silently handed me an apple. It was a moment so charged with metaphor, I
got confused; I couldn't even thank her. I'm sure she still thinks I was
an ungrateful jerk.</LD>
<LD>   You want to hear a strange truth? There's a part of the cop psyche
that's tremendously uncomfortable with such moments. Clutching that
apple, I couldn't help wondering: What happens when I go back to writing
tickets? What happens when the apple woman hears I took her brother in on
an old turnstile warrant? What happens when it's business as usual?</LD>
<LD>   But that's the thing, this time. This one is so big, business as usual
may never fully return. Forget relations with the public; that's not what
I mean. The real change is probably--had better be--in us. If Osama bin
Laden has reminded America of who we are as a nation, he's reminded New
York's cops of who we are as well.</LD>
<TE>   I grew up in this city, in a family of cops--my father, my uncles,
even my grandfather back in Italy. But in my 20s, while my relatives told
war stories over barbecues and backyard beers, I was a professor teaching
English at a university. It wasn't until my 30s that the tug of police
work asserted itself, inevitable as weather.</TE>
<TE>   In five years on the force, I've done beat work in uniform and
plainclothes narcotics work, but I know I'm still pretty inexperienced.
Yet, compared to the average citizen, I feel I know this city the way one
knows a difficult sibling.</TE>
<TE>   So, on the morning of the attacks, I recognize our immediate dilemma.
How do a handful of cops clear half a city block of people who are
certain they have to be here? By dark, I've had so many worthies give me
a hard time that I'm numb to the shock of it.</TE>
<TE>   Two actually choose to ignore my pleas to keep the area clear for body
removal just so they can walk their dogs, hideous little designer
creatures I have to restrain myself from punting into New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   And the volunteers! They come in droves, ragtag groups drifting up to
the checkpoint, young men and women in their 20s mostly, yearning to do
the right thing. But when told there's nothing for them to do here, they
encamp all over, turning the night of Day One into a crisis Woodstock.</TE>
<TE>   Late into that first night, when we've been standing on the same
corner for 14 hours without knowing what day we'll finally get home or
how completely our lives might be changed, two young women separate from
the volunteer army and tentatively approach us. My alarm rises vaguely
when I see one of them gingerly carrying a box.</TE>
<TE>   She's on me before I can protest, coming right up to me and my
partner. She asks us if we're hungry and tells us that she and her
roommate have made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for us, if we want
them. Which we do, desperately.</TE>
<TE>   Looking into the box, I see that inside each sandwich bag is a little
note: "Thank you for your bravery," and "God bless you." I have the first
of what will be many moments when I find it difficult to speak.</TE>
<TE>   Late that first night, I have occasion to wander right down to the
site. The dust is still heavy, and I can see only about 10 feet in front
of me. Wandering in this gloom, I have the strangest encounter: Four
people in medical scrubs suddenly appear and ask if I have seen anybody
who needs medical help. One nurse pulls down her surgical mask to ask if
I am OK. She smiles at me so beatifically that I wonder, for the briefest
moment, if I am still back at the checkpoint, have fallen asleep on my
feet and am having a strange Fellini-esque dream.</TE>
<TE>   They are gone soon, these apparitions; there is nothing for them to
do.</TE>
<TE>   During the early morning of the second day, we accept a grim reality:
Forget triage. The destruction is so great, there are very few wounded.
Seeing the site up close, I don't wonder. I wonder instead at people's
faith, that they can look at this and think anyone could have survived
it.</TE>
<TE>   After four hours of attempted sleep during which I imagine my nerve
endings humming to each other, I'm back for the evening of Day Two,
assigned over by the river. There, I discover that, when there is no
triage, there will be a morgue.</TE>
<TE>   A group of eight or so professionals--medical examiner, fire
department paramedic, police department chaplains--hunch on folding
chairs, waiting. Then the call goes up outside the tent: "Heads up. Body
coming!"</TE>
<TE>   The worker lugs it onto a makeshift table composed of a sheet
stretched over plywood. We crowd around, our heads bending to the bag.
Will it be a cop? A fireman? Will it be some horror I will never forget?</TE>
<TE>   The paramedic unzips the black plastic bag. This is human? That is my
first thought as her gloved hands sift the contents. But then I see. On a
mat of gray dust and paper fragments, a latticework of ribs. No blood or
flesh, nothing that is not simply gray and woolly with ash.</TE>
<TE>   Only occasionally is there more than this. One bag reveals a severed
human foot, the toenails painted a heartbreaking violet. And this,
eventually, is what shocks you, what sits you down with a nauseated,
displaced feel of a world spinning awry. Not the gore or the lack of it,
but the small details that point to fragile lives caught in the
maelstrom.</TE>
<TE>   Those details are what I'm here for; I'm one of five cops tagging and
bagging anything that might be linked to one of the dead. It's far, far
tougher than viewing human remains. Where morgue duty deals only with
representations of people--small, broken facsimiles of what they once
were--the property somehow manages to capture them, captures their lives
and personalities.</TE>
<TE>   A leather shoulder bag holds a management textbook and a notebook. The
textbook has a woman's name on the frontispiece in a graceful feminine
hand, the notebook her weekly classes written into the scheduling grid.
They're all evening classes; she was going to night school. Little
reminders are written beside the schedule: "Keep up with the reading!"</TE>
<TE>   You wonder: How could these things survive intact and their owners be
completely erased?</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the cell phones. If there is one dilemma facing the
property cops, it's what to do with a working cell phone. The argument
ensues every time a worker off the bucket brigade brings one in.
Undeniably, hitting the appropriate button will reveal the owner's last
call, and thus help with identification. But at what cost to the call's
recipient?</TE>
<TE>   And who will be the one to make that call, to risk raising false hopes
among family members or friends who will be receiving a phone call from a
dead person?</TE>
<TE>   We're digging now, anybody who can. It's still only Day Three, and the
chances of finding somebody alive are, in theory, still real. It's a
cyclical process; you pull carefully at the impossibly antagonistic
tangle of metal and concrete, until eventually a major beam or girder is
exposed. Then the ironworkers hook a crane line to the girder and hoist
it free. Then you start again.</TE>
<TE>   Among the cops working down here now, a distinction has emerged; the
photo-takers versus the non-photo-takers. Some feel the attacks are
something we should vow never to forget, so the scene should be
documented as much as possible. Others, myself included, find this
distasteful and would as soon forget these sights once (if ever) this is
over.</TE>
<TE>   A crane, off to my right, is noisily hoisting a half-melted girder
free of the rubble when a chorus of despair goes up. I turn in time to
catch a glimpse. It is a young woman, or rather the top half of one,
stuck to the top of the beam. Her arm flaps free once, a disembodied
wave; then the torso falls free, disappearing back into the wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   Go ahead, I can't help but think. Take a picture of that.</TE>
<TE>   It's raining now, and the ash has turned into a ubiquitous copper mud.
I pass a bedraggled group of firemen and find that, in my NYPD uniform, I
can't meet their eyes; they've suffered far more than we have--343
firefighters lost, and 60 NYPD and Port Authority cops.</TE>
<TE>   When the first building came down, a sergeant from my precinct was on
the street outside; he's long and lanky, and when he dived under a car
for shelter, an arriving emergency vehicle ran over his legs.</TE>
<TE>   That's what passed for a success story down here.</TE>
<TE>   For one night, Midtown becomes celebrity "ground zero"; a telethon is
being held to benefit victims and their families. As a Manhattan cop,
I've worked this sort of thing before. Your objective is to make sure the
"talent" gets in and gets out without something happening to make you
famous yourself.</TE>
<TE>   After Billy Joel's rendition of "New York State of Mind," I am
deputized to drive him down to greet the workers at ground zero. I
realize, watching little knots of hollow-eyed workers drifting over to
us, that I am not showing Billy Joel off to the rescuers, but quite the
reverse.</TE>
<TE>   This shows in Joel's reactions. Upon rounding a corner and taking in
the panorama of the destruction in one beat, he gets the "cannot speaks."
The workers all know this feeling. They happily ignore the fact that the
star is openly weeping as he signs their hard hats.</TE>
<TE>   Later that night, I take a walk down a side street and encounter a
couple of cops I don't know leaning on barricades and talking with a
young female aid worker. Flirting; this would have been unthinkable even
48 hours ago, and it suddenly strikes me that this horror may indeed end
at some point.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's difficult to believe that even now. And certainly it's
impossible to believe that "the Job," the NYPD, will ever be the same.</TE>
<TE>   I saw bosses we once laughed at and mimicked behind their backs
unhesitatingly organize rescue parties, establish medical stations,
dictate rest periods for their men, clamp order onto the sudden anarchy.
For the first week, patrolmen getting off their 12-hour shifts would defy
orders and head right back down to the site, where they would work until
literally delirious.</TE>
<TE>   Like the city, the Job's been blooded--by the instant in which
thousands died and by the months in which we sifted the wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   The city will eventually forget us; after all, we are just doing our
jobs. We'll be the enemy again soon enough. Which is fine; that's the
nature of a contentious and complicated relationship.</TE>
<TE>   But we, the cops, we had better remember. Not what we've seen, but
what we've done. It's the way you remember the things you've done that
make you who you are.</TE>

<HD>Pilots' Security Duties Make for Airborne Balancing Act</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The MD-88 passenger jetliner was cruising above 25,000 feet but
there was no one at the controls.</LD>
<LD>   Preoccupied with protecting the cockpit door while they took turns
going to the bathroom, the pilots momentarily forgot the cardinal safety
rule that the captain or the co-pilot must be strapped in and in control
of the aircraft at all times.</LD>
<LD>   The November incident illustrates an emerging safety issue: The focus
on aviation security since Sept. 11 has added new distractions to the
already demanding duties of pilots, at times prompting missteps that
could compromise a safe flight.</LD>
<TE>   A Times analysis of a NASA database known as the Aviation Safety
Reporting System found that reports of security-related problems more
than doubled in 2001, rising to 315 from 125. The anonymous reports
covered many concerns, including lapses in basic policies and loopholes
in airport screening.</TE>
<TE>   The increase reveals a system struggling to adjust to change and
points to a need for better security-related training.</TE>
<TE>   "Prior to the terrorist attacks . . . this error would have never
happened," wrote the captain of the jetliner that was briefly left
pilotless. "But the post-Sept. 11 door-locking device and one bonehead
move by a nonthinking pilot, and there you are."</TE>
<TE>   The plane was on autopilot, but an unexpected problem could have sent
the pilots scrambling for the controls.</TE>
<TE>   "These are not catastrophic things, but they definitely erode the
margin of safety," said Capt. Steve Luckey, security chairman for the Air
Line Pilots Assn. "The paradigm of operations has to include security,
but we just have to be more diligent and vigilant in guarding against
distractions."</TE>
<TE>   The NASA database is intended to serve as an early warning system,
spotting trends that could--if overlooked--create safety problems. It
provides a candid look inside aviation in the aftermath of the Sept. 11
terrorist hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   The Times analysis also found that security breaches at airports have
created a burden for flight crews already busy attending to dozens of
critical details before takeoffs. Pilots reported confrontations with
passengers who were able to bring aboard knives, scissors, bullets,
handcuffs and even an engine leaking gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   "Pilots have been under a great deal of pressure since Sept. 11, and
that alone creates concerns," said aviation safety consultant Barry
Schiff, a retired airline captain. "The job isn't what it used to be."</TE>
<TE>More Procedures, Added Confusion</TE>
<TE>   The largest single category of reports--about one-third of the
total--concerned breakdowns in policies and procedures. Most were minor,
dealing with such things as a pilot who forgot to complete required
paperwork because he was checking on a security matter. Others were more
serious.</TE>
<TE>   Mistakes in the air can have drastic consequences, so procedures are
gospel in the airline business. Pilots' adherence to prescribed routines
for every aspect of a flight is a central article of airline safety
programs. This conservative approach is designed to ensure safety through
constant attention to detail.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the security procedures grafted on since Sept. 11 have added
confusion.</TE>
<TE>   The new rule that requires pilots to remain behind locked cockpit
doors during flight sounds simple enough. But carrying it out has led to
several glaring mistakes. Pilots trying to coordinate lavatory breaks
unwittingly triggered other problems. The MD-88 that was briefly left
without a pilot is not the only example.</TE>
<TE>   In an incident shortly after the attacks on the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon, two pilots of a Boeing 757 had a misunderstanding about the
use of a code word. It led Air Force jets to intercept the plane after
one of the pilots mistakenly radioed that a hijacking was in progress.</TE>
<TE>   The plane's co-pilot had recently attended a security briefing in
which pilots were told they should agree on a "duress word" before either
of them left the cockpit in flight. If the pilot who left spoke the
duress word over the intercom, the pilot who stayed behind would know
there was trouble in the cabin and the cockpit door should stay locked.
The idea was to prevent a hijacker from getting into the cockpit by
overpowering a pilot on a bathroom break.</TE>
<TE>   The captain had not received the same security briefing, however, and
as he left the co-pilot in charge, he thought they were agreeing on a
password for him to get back into the cockpit.</TE>
<TE>   When the captain used the duress word to get back inside, the co-pilot
immediately alerted ground control of a potential hijacking. Eventually
the co-pilot realized the misunderstanding and let the captain back in.
But then, ground controllers didn't believe their assurances that
everything was all right.</TE>
<TE>   Air traffic control "took a conservative approach and assumed we were
a possible hijacked aircraft," the co-pilot wrote. The misunderstanding
was resolved after the plane landed in Boston with an F-16 escort and was
met by a state police security detail.</TE>
<TE>   "Air traffic control had no way of knowing if those were the hijackers
saying everything was OK," said pilot John Russell, who is the union's
safety chairman in the West. "A very simple mistake obviously blossomed
into something very, very big."</TE>
<TE>   The incident took place before cockpit doors were equipped with a
metal brace to keep out intruders. Now a flight attendant must stay
inside the cockpit to operate the metal brace when a pilot takes a
lavatory break.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's El Al Airlines, known for its tight security, has recognized
that something as innocuous as a bathroom break could become a
vulnerability, so El Al pilots have a private bathroom between the
cockpit and the cabin.</TE>
<TE>   Such a solution is unlikely on U.S. planes, partly because it would
require taking out revenue-producing passenger seats to accommodate a
lavatory, some pilots say. However, pilot groups in the U.S. are calling
for the installation of a video system that would let the cockpit crew
see what is going on in the passenger cabin. They also hope new airline
security training programs for dealing with hijackings will help.</TE>
<TE>   In another case, confusion about security procedures led pilots to
disregard an on-board collision avoidance warning.</TE>
<TE>   A Falcon 900, a large corporate plane powered by three jet engines,
was flying from Chicago to Baltimore on a cloudy day last fall. As the
plane began its approach over central Maryland, ground controllers
advised the pilots that military F-15s were in the area, investigating a
possible unidentified intruder to the north.</TE>
<TE>Fighters Were Quickly Closing In on Jet</TE>
<TE>   "We asked the controller if [the F-15s] were aware of us," one of the
pilots wrote in his report. "He said he would have to go ask. He was not
talking to the F-15[s]." The pilots had no way of communicating with the
fighter jets because military aircraft use a different radio frequency.</TE>
<TE>   Monitoring their radar, the pilots could see the military jets quickly
closing in. An on-board warning system told them to go to a lower
altitude to maintain a safe distance. But the ground controller urged
them to ignore the warning.</TE>
<TE>   "He said we were in the vicinity of Camp David [the presidential
retreat in Maryland] and unusual moves made the military nervous," the
pilot wrote. He saw the military jets darting by through a break in the
clouds.</TE>
<TE>   The corporate jet landed safely, but its crew was troubled. "We talked
to the controllers by phone after landing," the pilot wrote. "The
controller's supervisor told him it was wrong to tell us to ignore the
[warning system]. Legally, I should have followed [it]."</TE>
<TE>   Commenting about the incident later, a NASA reviewer wrote: "Event had
the potential for degrading into a very unstable situation."</TE>
<TE>   Improving communication with military interceptors is a safety
priority for pilots' groups since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "The threat isn't as ominous as it seems because the military jets
have very good radar systems and can maintain safe separation on their
own," the ALPA's Luckey said. "But when you get into high-traffic areas
and you have that fighter jet element in there, you do diminish the
margin of safety."</TE>
<TE>   Airport screening problems were the second most common source of
security-related reports to the NASA database. Nearly one-fifth of the
reports involved loopholes in passenger security and 7% more dealt with
complaints about overly intrusive searches of uniformed crew members
carrying proper identification.</TE>
<TE>   The reports told of repeated instances in which pilots became
backstops for porous airport security systems that continued to allow
passengers with knives, bullets and other prohibited articles to board.
In one case, a man on the FBI's watch list was allowed on a flight, but
the plane was called back to the gate before it took off.</TE>
<TE>   A typical incident in November involved a woman who boarded a
London-bound flight at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport
with a pocketknife in her purse.</TE>
<TE>   She dropped the knife on the floor as she was trying to get into her
seat. Other passengers saw it and called flight attendants. The woman
hastily stepped on the knife to try to hide it.</TE>
<TE>   A flight attendant confiscated the knife and brought it to the
captain, who was preparing for takeoff. "I immediately brought the knife
. . . to the security supervisor for the gate," the captain wrote. "He
shrugged his shoulders and said, 'Yeah.' "</TE>
<TE>Security Process 'Failed Miserably'</TE>
<TE>   The captain said he felt "tremendous pressure" that it was up to him
alone to ensure no one aboard his plane was a security risk. He decided
the Boeing 777 would not take off with the woman aboard, and she was
asked to leave. The incident delayed the flight by an hour and 10
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   After arriving at London's Heathrow Airport, the captain said he found
out the woman boarded a later flight, but not before another prohibited
item was found in her luggage. By then, she was drunk and had become
abusive.</TE>
<TE>   "Security screening procedures and security personnel failed
miserably," the captain wrote. "But what is worse [is] the arrogance that
no one is to blame, no one is responsible, no one is accountable."</TE>

<HD>Ominous Cracks Seen in Gun Control Utopia</HD>
<DH>Europe: Laws stricter than those in the U.S. haven't prevented
recent rampages. Part of the problem is a booming underworld trade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MADRID
</DL>
<LD>On paper, Western Europe seems like a gun control utopia. The laws
governing firearms are tougher than those in the United States. Citizens
are less likely to be armed. And the number of gun crimes is
substantially lower.</LD>
<LD>   On the street, though, there are signs of ominous change.</LD>
<LD>   Friday's massacre at a school in Germany was the latest in a series of
bloody gun crimes around the continent during the last year. The two
worst examples were the slaughter of eight city council members in a
Paris suburb last month and the killing of 14 regional legislators in
Switzerland in September.</LD>
<TE>   Europeans say these incidents are more typical of the United States,
which they condemn for a Wild West gun culture. But the number of guns
and violent crimes has risen in France, Germany, Britain and elsewhere.
The trend defies laws that have grown more restrictive: The blood bath in
Germany occurred on the same day that the national Parliament passed
stern anti-gun legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The problem stems partly from a booming underworld economy. Smugglers
based in the war-torn Balkans pump an industrial-sized flow of illicit
firearms into the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   Once in the EU, moreover, the smugglers don't confront many obstacles.
The relaxation of border enforcement that encourages travel and commerce
has been a boon to criminals, whether they are smuggling goods or jumping
back and forth across borders to commit crimes and escape police.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the human factor. As crime has dropped in the United
States in recent years, it has worsened in much of Europe, despite
generous welfare states designed to prevent U.S.-style inequality and
social conflict. Nihilistic rage flares in classroom violence in Germany,
car-arson rampages in France, brutal muggings in Britain.</TE>
<TE>Alienation a Factor</TE>
<TE>   Those incidents often involve alienated young people, ethnic
minorities or immigrants, whom politicians and the public tend to blame
for violence. But it's not always that simple. A gunman who stormed into
a rural police station in the French region of Brittany two weeks ago and
opened fire with an AK-47, killing a policeman, was a French-born,
48-year-old farmer enraged by a traffic altercation.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a general climate of violence that has developed over the
years and an American-style evolution of French society," warned Charles
Pasqua, a former interior minister.</TE>
<TE>   Judging from the tension in the low-income housing projects of the
urban periphery, it's a good thing that gun laws are harsh. Youth gangs
don't hesitate to attack police stations in Marseille and Paris. But they
generally use rocks, Molotov cocktails or cars set ablaze and converted
into rolling missiles, not firearms.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of guns helps explain Europe's remarkably low homicide
statistics, experts say. While Los Angeles County recorded about 1,000
homicides in 2000, there was about the same number in all of France.
Spain registered 1,200 homicides last year. London suffered only 148
shootings that resulted in death or grievous injury last year.</TE>
<TE>   Britain, of course, has some of the toughest firearm laws in the
world. The Labor government outlawed handguns in 1997 in response to a
rampage by a gunman who mowed down 16 schoolchildren, ages 5 and 6, and
their teacher in the Scottish town of Dunblane.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as now, Britons blamed violent U.S. films and television shows
for promoting violence and gun use. After the law passed, Britons
surrendered about 160,000 handguns to police.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the statistics are not good. Between April and November
2001, the number of homicides in London committed with a firearm rose
almost 90% over the same period a year earlier. Armed street robberies
rose 53%.</TE>
<TE>   British police, once known as unarmed "bobbies" patrolling placid
streets, have deployed armed response vehicles equipped to deal with
gunmen. Gang and drug activity have propelled an influx of guns,
particularly automatic weapons, from the United States, Eastern Europe
and Asia, according to Scotland Yard.</TE>
<TE>Arms From the East</TE>
<TE>   French police say Eastern Europe is the source of arms flooding into
France, where crime went up 8% overall in 2001. It's no longer uncommon
for police to confront well-trained, paramilitary-style gangs of robbers
wielding AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenades and other heavy weapons.</TE>
<TE>   A smuggling trail known as "the Balkans route" has linked Eastern and
Western Europe for years. In the former Yugoslav federation, as well as
in Albania and Bulgaria, large numbers of military weapons found their
way into the hands of the general population and gangs.</TE>
<TE>   The situation was particularly severe in Albania. In 1997, the
successor government to the former Communist regime fell after a
corruption scandal. Angry citizens--as well as gangsters--looted the
government's armories, making off with about a million military weapons:
assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and antitank missiles.
Some of those weapons no doubt moved to Western Europe, where Albanian
gangsters are heavily involved in gunrunning.</TE>
<TE>   Government authorities in the former Yugoslav states also are often
involved in the smuggling. Guns move across Bulgaria and the former
Yugoslav states and into Albania or Croatia and then are ferried across
the Adriatic into Italy.</TE>
<TE>   "The great number of war weapons that you see in our country is
extremely dangerous," French President Jacques Chirac said this month.
"What has to be attacked is the trafficking."</TE>
<TE>   Like Germany and Britain, France has reacted to recent high-profile
shootings by making restrictive laws even tougher, but it's not clear
that those safeguards would have prevented the mass slaying last month of
eight city council members in suburban Nanterre near Paris. Like the
German student accused in Friday's massacre, the Nanterre shooter
belonged to a target shooting club and obtained his gun legally, although
he had a history of aggressive behavior and psychological troubles.</TE>
<TE>   In the years before the shooting, French police in the Nanterre area
were impeded from reviewing the psychological data on applicants for gun
licenses, according to media reports. The Health Ministry reportedly
rejected several attempted reviews, saying mental health records were
protected by medical privacy laws. Red tape also works in favor of public
safety, however. In Italy, gun owners say the medical screening for
applicants is infamously lax, but police checks are rigorous and getting
a license renewed is a burden.</TE>
<TE>   Relatively few Italians own guns. The rules resemble those of Spain
and other countries. Gun owners in Italy must be at least 18 years old,
have a clean police record, undergo psychological and physical tests and
have an official certificate proving that they are capable of handling
firearms. A person may not own more than three guns, and gun licenses
must be renewed every year.</TE>
<TE>   Italian Defense Minister Antonio Martino suggested in a radio
interview Monday that the country's gun laws should be loosened. Martino
cited the U.S. Bill of Rights' 2nd Amendment, protecting the right of
citizens to bear arms, as a model.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said the minister's comments reflected a rising sense of
insecurity as the population ages and the number of immigrants rises.
Unlike in other European countries, fear in Italy has increased even as
the number of violent crimes has gone down slightly.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the restrictions can stop deranged gunmen, Europe's cultural
resistance to guns is likely to endure.</TE>

<HD>Gunman Legally Owned Weapons in German Attack</HD>
<DH>Violence: A teacher ended the school massacre by locking the
'skilled shooter' in a room, where he killed himself, police say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ERFURT, Germany
</DL>
<LD>A teenage gunman who killed 16 people and himself at his former
school here was a gun-club member who legally owned the weapons he
carried in the rampage, targeting most of his victims with well-aimed
pistol shots to the head, authorities said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Friday's blood bath was cut short after about 15 minutes by a
courageous history teacher, Rainer Heise, who managed to shove the
black-clad gunman into a room and lock the door, German police said
Saturday. The gunman killed himself a few minutes later as police stormed
the building.</LD>
<LD>   Students and teachers identified the killer as Robert Steinhaeuser,
19. He was expelled this year for forging absentee excuse notes, police
said.</LD>
<TE>   In a country where concern over firearms has focused primarily on
illegal weapons, the revelation that Steinhaeuser owned his guns legally
and belonged to two gun clubs added to the shock of the crime, which left
this eastern state capital deep in mourning Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think young people shouldn't have the possibility to have weapons,"
said Hans Mueller, 75, among hundreds who stood in line at City Hall to
sign a condolence book. "The whole city is sad that such an incident had
to happen here."</TE>
<TE>   Britain adopted some of the world's toughest gun-control laws after a
weapons enthusiast killed 16 students and their teacher with legally
owned handguns in Dunblane, Scotland, in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   History teacher Heise told Germany's ZDF television that during
Friday's shooting, he took refuge in a storage room, locking the door,
but that he opened the door when he heard shuffling outside because he
thought that it was a student. He found himself facing a pistol held by
someone dressed in black "like a ninja fighter."</TE>
<TE>   "I looked into the barrel," Heise recalled. "Simultaneously, with his
left hand, he took off his mask. I said, 'Robert!' "</TE>
<TE>   Defenseless, Heise continued speaking to the former student, he said:
"Fire! You can shoot me too now . . . [but] look into my eyes."</TE>
<TE>   "Steinhaeuser replied: 'No. That's enough for today, Mr. Heise,' " he
recalled. Heise then told him that they had to talk and that he should
come into the room. As Steinhaeuser let down his guard, "I pushed him
into the room, closed the door and locked it," Heise said. "I didn't have
time to be afraid."</TE>
<TE>   Police initially did not reveal the gunman's identity. But
Steinhaeuser's home here in Erfurt, the capital of the state of
Thuringia, was cordoned off by police Saturday, and newspapers and
television carried his photograph, showing a short-haired young man with
a hard stare.</TE>
<TE>   Police said he fired 40 pistol shots in the deadly rampage. An
additional 500 rounds of ammunition were found at the school, an
indication that he was equipped to kill far more people, police said.
Another 500 rounds were found at his home, all of it legal, authorities
said. Although he also carried a pump-action shotgun, he fired only the
handgun, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was targeting the teachers," Bernhard Vogel, the Thuringia state
governor, told a news conference Saturday. "Investigators confirmed to me
that he was a skilled shooter. You can see that from the many shots to
the head."</TE>
<TE>   Somber visitors placed hundreds of bouquets in front of Johann
Gutenberg secondary school, where 13 school employees, two students and
one policeman died.</TE>
<TE>   Police said that they believe there was only one gunman but that they
are investigating claims that a second killer was seen or heard firing in
the school. Vogel appeared unconvinced that Steinhaeuser had acted alone.</TE>
<TE>   The only comparable mass murder in Germany's post-World War II history
was a terrorist attack at the 1972 Munich Olympics that left 11 Israeli
athletes and officials and a West German policeman dead.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities initially reported 18 deaths in Friday's slaughter,
including the gunman, but police said Saturday that a female teacher
thought to be dead when taken from the school had survived. Ten people
were injured in the shooting, none critically, police said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and his wife, Doris
Schroeder-Kopf, flew to Erfurt to place flowers at the school and attend
an evening church service.</TE>
<TE>   "All explanations fail," Joachim Wanke, the local bishop, told 2,000
people at the service. "I pray together with you for the dead. I mourn
together with you, the next of kin. I mourn with you, my city of Erfurt,
which also has been hit by yesterday's shots."</TE>
<TE>   Jane Kloeppel, 13, a student from another school who was among the
mourners in front of the Johann Gutenberg building, said she came even
though she didn't know any of the victims. "It doesn't matter if you know
them or not," she said, tears falling down her cheeks. "The whole city is
shocked. . . . I just can't believe that young people like him can go to
shooting clubs and get training. It's pure craziness."</TE>
<TE>   Edmund Stoiber, the conservative challenger to Schroeder in national
elections scheduled this year, reacted to the killings with a call for a
ban on violent video and computer games.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the flowers piled outside City Hall was a photograph of one of
the teachers with a message from her daughter: "Why did you have to die?
Nobody deserved this. Mama, I love you and I always loved you, no matter
how hard the times were. I love you. Your Franziska."</TE>

<HD>Rumsfeld, in Kabul, Discusses Future Afghan Army</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld flew into this capital
Saturday for a daylong visit, his Chinook helicopter landing on the U.S.
Embassy grounds for security reasons and spraying a hail of dust over
waiting Afghan military officials.</LD>
<LD>   Rumsfeld was coy, however, about reports that members of the U.S.
military are involved in anti-terrorist operations across the border in
Pakistan, insisting that Washington has no business disclosing such
operations.</LD>
<LD>   He said only that the U.S. is pleased with the cooperation it has had
from Pakistan in the war against terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Rumsfeld also spoke with members of the international peacekeeping
force at Bagram air base north of Kabul, where he earlier landed before
flying by chopper to the U.S. Embassy here.</TE>
<TE>   At the presidential palace in the capital, he met with the interim
Afghan prime minister, Hamid Karzai, and defense minister, Mohammed
Qassim Fahim, and discussed the future of Afghanistan's army and how it
should be structured.</TE>
<TE>   During the U.S. military operation in Afghanistan, it's believed that
many figures associated with either the deposed Taliban regime or the Al
Qaeda terrorist network have slipped into Pakistan, because the border
between the two countries is almost impossible to police.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said the porous border makes it difficult to eliminate
terrorist groups, but "it doesn't make it an impossible situation."</TE>
<TE>   But he said U.S. policy is not to discuss what is going on inside a
country if its leaders prefer secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   "I can only say that I have been very happy with the broad cooperation
by the Pakistan government," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that, although it would be impossible to seal the
Afghan-Pakistani border, it is possible to trace clusters of Al Qaeda and
Taliban fighters and go after them.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said that if U.S. military forces were in Pakistan, it would
be up to Pakistan's government to announce that.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is a sensitive one for the government in Pakistan, where a
referendum is to be held Tuesday on whether to extend the term of
President Pervez Musharraf, an army general who overthrew the civilian
government in 1999. In the northwestern frontier region of Pakistan, the
main area where Taliban and Al Qaeda members are thought to be
sheltering, anti-American sentiment is high.</TE>
<TE>   Although Rumsfeld and Karzai discussed the shape of an Afghan national
army, they offered few new details of how it might look. It will be
trained by the U.S. and France, and Washington has been organizing
meetings of international donors to help fund security in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld's visit was a boost to Karzai on the eve of a big military
parade in Kabul set to feature tanks and soldiers. His stop came the day
after a rocket attack on Bagram that caused no casualties or damage.</TE>
<TE>   The secretary's trip also coincided with an upsurge of fighting in the
city of Gardez, 60 miles south of Kabul, in an apparent struggle between
political rivals.</TE>
<TE>   In the evening, Rumsfeld traveled to the western city of Herat, where
he met with Gov. Ismail Khan.</TE>

<DL>GOLDEN HORSE MONASTERY, Thailand
</DL>
<LD>He was a soldier and champion boxer, but now the burly abbot leads
a band of "Little Buddhas," some as young as 7, who practice martial arts
and meditation, then ride into the mountains to fight the scourge of
drugs.</LD>
<LD>   There are nearly 33,000 Buddhist monasteries in this country, but not
many like this remote retreat set in the limestone crags and bamboo
thickets of northern Thailand.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the country's sanctuaries are defined by a languid atmosphere
and little physical exertion by the clergy. The Golden Horse Monastery
resounds with the neighing of about 100 horses, the thwack of body
punches and the barking of orders at ranks of disciplined youngsters.</LD>
<TE>   "Before, I was just a soldier of Thailand. Now I am a soldier of the
lord of all the world's people. Now, I fight against lies, theft, hate
and violence," says Abbot Kru Ba Nua Chai, seated in a simple hall
stacked with religious icons.</TE>
<TE>Buddha's Army</TE>
<TE>   His little army consists of the sons of impoverished hill tribe
families, most of them orphans, some former drug addicts. Its mission,
Kru Ba says, is to spread the Buddha's teachings and combat widespread
drug abuse among tribal people in an area where narcotics are as common
as cold pills.</TE>
<TE>   The 40-year-old monk, accompanied by some novices, spends about half
of each month trekking through the rugged region along the Myanmar
border. They ride horses, which fare better than vehicles, especially
during monsoons.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't like to mix with city people," Kru Ba says, his forceful
voice accompanied by the tinkling of temple wind chimes. "There are some
good people in the cities but they are hard to find. People in the hills
have a great sense of honesty."</TE>
<TE>   It's from the hill peoples--the Akha, Lahu, Hmong, Lisu, Shan and
others--that he draws his recruits, from villages without schools and
grim futures as a burgeoning population faces shrinking farmland, ravaged
forests and infertile soil.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't speak all their languages but we can speak the language of
the heart," Kru Ba says.</TE>
<TE>   Some ethnic Thais also come, including Manop Indhamot, 31, who says he
had been a drug addict from his youth until two years ago, when his
parents brought him to the monastery with its mix of rural peace and
regimentation.</TE>
<TE>   Wake-up call is at 1 a.m., followed by meditation, religious teaching
and prayer-chanting until dawn. Then, standing in military formation, the
novices--there currently are 17--count off before calisthenics and
immersion in a pool of frigid mountain water for more meditation. There
are periodic fasts, lasting as long as three days.</TE>
<TE>   Days are spent cleaning the monastery grounds, cooking and caring for
horses, which the novices gallop, yellow robes flapping.</TE>
<TE>   Thai-style boxing is practiced every evening and Kru Ba, tucking his
robes between his legs, demonstrates techniques. Using knees, elbows,
feet and fists, the monk shows how he could disable his young sparring
partner if he applied real force.</TE>
<TE>   Such behavior ordinarily would be considered unmonkly, but instilling
discipline and mastering self-defense are needed for the ventures into
lawless border areas, Kru Ba says. Thai boxing also is one of the few
escapes out of rural poverty for skilled boys.</TE>
<TE>   Kru Ba, who spent five years in the army, fought his last bout in
1991--"Never got knocked out," he notes proudly. A year later he left his
wife and two children to meditate alone in the forest and establish the
monastery.</TE>
<TE>Solid Credentials</TE>
<TE>   In recent times, Thai Buddhism has suffered from rogue monks and
others who have stretched the Buddha's teachings beyond all bounds.</TE>
<TE>   But Kru Ba's credentials are solid. His monastery is supported in part
by the office of the Supreme Patriarch, the country's Buddhist leader.</TE>
<TE>   Also assisting is the Third Army, Thailand's front line of defense
against the flow of opium, heroin and methamphetamines from Myanmar and
other areas of the tri-border region of Thailand, Laos and Myanmar known
as the Golden Triangle.</TE>
<TE>   Manop, the former drug addict, escorts a visitor past the open-sided
thatch huts that serve as sleeping quarters and to a hilltop cave where
he says Kru Ba retreats for fasts and meditation lasting as long as 15
days.</TE>
<TE>   The hillside is studded with crude cement figures of boxers, giant
cockerels and the winged steeds that also appear as tattoos on the chests
of many novices. There's an elephant skull and assorted amulets,
artifacts of animism and magic that permeates so much of Thailand's
Buddhist faith.</TE>
<TE>   "It is so peaceful here," Manop says, looking out over the fields and
hills rolling toward Myanmar. "I never want to go back to where I came
from."</TE>

<HD>U.S.-Based Activist in China on a False Passport Is Held</HD>
<DH>Asia: Dissident Yang Jianli, believed to be barred from entering
the country, is being confined to a hotel by police, his wife says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY KUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>Police have detained a U.S.-based dissident who had been traveling
through China on a false passport while researching a wave of recent
labor protests, according to his wife.</LD>
<LD>   Yang Jianli entered China on April 18 using a friend's passport, but
he was stopped by police Friday trying to board an airplane in the
southern city of Kunming. Police have since confined him to a room in a
local hotel.</LD>
<LD>   "I think he's just waiting for the police to decide what to do with
him. I'm not sure they know who he is," said Yang's wife, speaking by
telephone from Boston, where he heads the Foundation for China in the
21st Century, a group advocating nonviolent democratization in China.</LD>
<TE>   Yang's detention comes during a politically sensitive time for China.
Vice President Hu Jintao is beginning his first visit to the United
States, just months before a major transition in China's leadership in
which he is expected to assume the posts of president and head of the
Communist Party.</TE>
<TE>   Before his detention, Yang, 38, traveled to Liaoyang and other cities
in the industrial northeast, where laid-off factory workers have mounted
some of the biggest and longest protests in half a century of Communist
rule. The demonstrations have led to the arrest of several protest
organizers.</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent edition of his Internet newsletter, ChinaEweekly,
Yang wrote that the Chinese government has accused protesters in Liaoyang
of collaborating with "overseas hostile forces" as a way of minimizing
public sympathy for the workers and driving a wedge between democracy
activists inside and outside the country.</TE>
<TE>   "Overseas democracy activists should charge or sneak into China to
coordinate" with domestic activists, Yang wrote April 10. Otherwise, he
warned, exiled dissidents risk irrelevance, by being reduced to lobbying
"foreign congresses, while out of touch with the actual work of the
domestic democracy movement."</TE>
<TE>   Most of China's best-known dissidents have been imprisoned or exiled
abroad in recent years, and pro-democracy protests have all but
disappeared since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. On China's streets
today, protesters are usually unpaid pensioners, defrauded investors or
overtaxed peasants.</TE>
<TE>   Overseas, Chinese dissident groups have been dogged by personality
clashes and bickering over tactics. Many inside China scoff at them and
point to their fleeing abroad as a sign of self-serving motives.</TE>
<TE>   A former doctoral student in mathematics at UC Berkeley, Yang returned
to China in 1989 to participate in the democracy protests in Tiananmen
Square. He later obtained a doctorate from Harvard University's Kennedy
School of Government.</TE>
<TE>   Yang's name is believed to be on a police blacklist of about 50
Chinese citizens living overseas who are barred from reentering the
country, a practice that critics say violates international law.</TE>
<TE>   Yang intended to "exercise his right to return home," and he has
encouraged fellow dissidents to do likewise, said Zhang Weiguo, editor of
Yang's newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996 and 1999, Yang attempted to return to China through Hong Kong
along with other high-profile dissidents but was turned back on both
occasions, Zhang said.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese authorities have refused to renew Yang's passport since it
expired, Zhang added, leaving him with a U.S. permanent resident card as
his only form of identification.</TE>

<HD>British Police Stand Up to Rising Tide of Crime</HD>
<DH>Safety: Some officials say risk of mugging is greater in London
than in New York. Cell phone fad and social policies are blamed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS WAGNER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>The police patrol had just begun when the officers jumped from
their van and cornered three teenagers on a busy street in central
London.</LD>
<LD>   A search found the boys wearing two sets of clothes--as muggers
sometimes do so they can quickly alter their appearance. One of the boys
had two cell phones in his pocket, and another held an unusually large
amount of cash.</LD>
<LD>   They were found near the private Jewish Free School, where many
students have been mugged, often for their mobile phones, but the youths
were defiant under questioning.</LD>
<TE>   "You don't need to know how I got here," said one wearing a New York
Yankees baseball cap and silver earrings. "You didn't need to stop me. I
don't want to talk to you."</TE>
<TE>   With no evidence to tie the boys to a crime, the police had to let
them go. But first the officers turned the boys toward surveillance
cameras and took photos of them to keep at the local station.</TE>
<TE>   Muggings and other street crimes have soared in London and elsewhere
in Britain, leaving many citizens anxious and bringing orders from the
national government to crack down. Scotland Yard has officers on special
patrols in nine areas of London where street crime is the worst.</TE>
<TE>   One of those is Camden, which is an odd mix of middle-class
neighborhoods and rough "hot spots" known for prostitutes, muggers, drug
dealers, homeless people and gangs. Also getting special attention are
several impoverished boroughs as well as Westminster, the central area
where tourists flock to see Big Ben, Parliament and Buckingham Palace.</TE>
<TE>   Some British officials say crime has increased so sharply that
pedestrians are more likely to be mugged here than in New York. From
September through November, 19,248 robberies were reported in London,
more than double the same period the previous year. Many of those crimes
were part of a wave of cell phone thefts.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a remarkable increase in street crime and gun-related
crime in London, unlike anything I think we've seen in the past,"
Metropolitan Police Commander Robert Quick said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   When former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani visited in February to
receive an honorary knighthood, he was praised for his "zero tolerance"
policies that slashed crime by 52%.</TE>
<TE>   London's growing lawlessness has produced a torrent of front-page
headlines chronicling assaults, carjackings, killings and gang warfare.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the leap in robberies, gun crime rose by about 50% in
the last year. Burglaries increased 3.6%, and crimes involving
automobiles such as carjackings rose 3.8%.</TE>
<TE>   The figures do not mean London has lost its standing as a relatively
safe city by world standards. For instance, 26 murders were recorded in
January, compared to 11 in Washington, D.C., which has less than
one-tenth the population of Britain's capital.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, increased police patrols in London have led to
thousands of arrests and a reduction in the number of reported muggings.
Still, the crime wave has touched off a widespread debate about Britain's
justice system and whether it is too easy on criminals, in part to keep
them out of the country's overcrowded prisons.</TE>
<TE>   As British officials embrace Giuliani's message about crime fighting,
it remains unclear how well the lessons of New York would work in London.</TE>
<TE>   The two cities have roughly the same populations, but London has
26,000 police officers compared to New York's 41,000. And the New York
police commissioner is responsible only to the mayor, while London's is
accountable to both the national and city governments.</TE>
<TE>   Police often cite three main reasons for the increase in crime: a
shortage of officers, reassignment of many officers to anti-terrorist
duties after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, and the surge in
mobile phone thefts.</TE>
<TE>   But they also say many of the people being arrested are young,
first-time offenders who joined street gangs as a defense against being
bullied in poor areas, then turned to petty crime.</TE>
<TE>   Quick, the police commander, disagrees with the notion that the
current problem is a temporary result of the mobile phone fad. He blames
broader social problems.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are seeing is a cultural shift in the streets, and I think
it's a consequence of some of our economic and social policies in
London," he said.</TE>

<HD>Millions in Royal Debt Has Pakistan in Predicament</HD>
<DH>Finances: Sums owed by Emirates' ruling family hobble the Asian
nation's bid to sell a state-owned bank at a fair price, as part of
economic reforms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>When a rich Persian Gulf sheik with a bad heart and a reputation
for heavy drinking died two years ago, he saddled a state-owned bank in
Pakistan with a $227-million debt he had refused to pay for more than two
decades.</LD>
<LD>   In a separate case, an Arab princess and the Emirate of Sharjah
stiffed the same bank, United Bank Ltd., for $87 million, Pakistani
President Pervez Musharraf said in a letter to the ruler of the United
Arab Emirates.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, impoverished Pakistan has had to go begging to the
wealthy Emirates to cover $314 million in royal debts. Confidential bank
and government documents, including Musharraf's letter, make it clear
that the loans are hurting Pakistan's efforts to sell its fourth-largest
bank at a fair price, as part of an economic reform package.</LD>
<TE>   The worlds of international banking and main emirate Abu Dhabi's royal
family are secretive, so many details about the loans and the borrowers
are hard to come by. The matter is so sensitive that officials in both
countries refuse to speak on the record about it.</TE>
<TE>   But the leaked documents shed some light on difficulties and internal
divisions in Pakistan stemming from loans made for "prestigious
residential developments" in the late 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf, already struggling with Islamic extremism and political
opposition, is trying to meet a May 31 deadline to sell United Bank and
other state-run companies to gain loans from the International Monetary
Fund that Pakistan needs to recover from years of sleaze and turmoil.</TE>
<TE>   However, the leading candidate to buy the bank is from Abu Dhabi's
ruling family--as was the man who never paid the $227 million--raising
concerns about a possible conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Sheik Mohammed ibn Khalid al Nuhayyan died about two years ago in his
mid-50s. An Emirates banking source said that Mohammed had a reputation
as a heavy drinker and a bad risk and that he eventually was blacklisted
by his own country's central bank.</TE>
<TE>   He was the nephew of Sheik Zayed ibn Sultan al Nuhayyan, who has
governed the oil-rich Emirates since they gained independence from
Britain in 1971. In 1998, the last time that Zayed made it onto Forbes
magazine's list of top 10 billionaires, he ranked seventh, with an
estimated worth of $15 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The Nuhayyan family is also associated in banking circles with the
Bank of Credit and Commerce International, of which they were the
principal shareholders. BCCI laundered millions of dollars for Western
intelligence agencies, arms and drug traffickers, and terrorists before
collapsing in 1991.</TE>
<TE>Conflict of Interest Seen</TE>
<TE>   One of Zayed's cousins, Sheik Nuhayyan Mabarak al Nuhayyan, is
chairman of BCCI's Karachi-based successor, Bank Al Falah, and heads the
Abu Dhabi Group that is considered the front-runner among three bidders
for United Bank's $2.7 billion in assets and 1,370 branches. His group is
also one of the top two contenders for the state-owned Pakistan
Telecommunications Co. Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   A senior United Bank executive, international division chief Aman A.
Siddiqui, expressed concern in an Oct. 23 memo about a possible conflict
of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Abu Dhabi consortium is headed by a cousin of the
Emirates' ruler, "it is likely they will exert influence against
resolution of the matter, as it gives them a huge pricing advantage if
the matter remains on hold," Siddiqui wrote to United Bank President Amar
Zafar Khan.</TE>
<TE>   Siddiqui told Khan in a separate memo that an intermediary for the
Emirates, former Ambassador to Pakistan Mohammad Atiq al Qamzi, would
advise his clients to buy the bank without settling the debts.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf put his prestige on the line by pleading for a settlement.
In a March 2001 letter, he offered prayers for Zayed's recovery from
surgery, and then asked his help in getting the $314 million back.</TE>
<TE>   "Efforts to secure payment of these loans have failed over all these
years, primarily due to [the] inability of the bank to secure cooperation
from the borrowers and the desire of [United Bank] not to create an
embarrassing situation in its host country," Musharraf wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "However, repayment of the two loans has become highly urgent for
Pakistan because they represent a major drain on the bank's resources and
thereby on the vulnerable economy," he added. If the loans were not
repaid, he said, Pakistan would have to delay privatization of the bank
or sell it at a big discount.</TE>
<TE>   "The failure to recover the loans would also have an impact on the
financial arrangements being currently sought from the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank by Pakistan," Musharraf wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The Emirates' ruler did not respond, a serious loss of face for
Musharraf. Ibrahim al Abed, an Emirates government spokesman, said the
nation considered the debts a personal matter that had nothing to do with
the government.</TE>
<TE>   Other Pakistani officials have minimized the dispute or sought to
write off the debts.</TE>
<TE>   Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz, a banker with long experience in the
Middle East, dismissed suggestions of problems with the bank sale as "a
bunch of garbage" and refused to discuss the loan dispute on the record.</TE>
<TE>   Aziz took charge of Citibank's corporate banking operations in the
Middle East, Africa and Central and Eastern Europe in early 1992 and
visited the Emirates that March to seek ways to increase business.</TE>
<TE>   Seven years later, a U.S. Senate committee reported that Citibank had
failed to stop money laundering by clients that included high-profile
politicians such as Asif Ali Zardari, husband of former Pakistani Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto. Zardari allegedly used Citibank accounts,
including one in the Emirate of Dubai, to hide kickbacks that Pakistani
authorities said he had received from foreign companies.</TE>
<TE>   John Reed, then-chairman of Citigroup Inc., the parent of Citibank,
acknowledged that there had been problems and said he had appointed Aziz
in May 1997 to clean them up. Aziz was still head of Citibank's global
private banking division when he joined Musharraf's government in 1999,
after the general seized power.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate committee held hearings that year and criticized Citibank
for abuses that occurred after Aziz took charge of global private
banking, such as allowing the president of Gabon, Omar Bongo, and sons of
the late Gen. Sani Abacha, who was then Nigeria's leader, to move
suspicious funds.</TE>
<TE>   "Citibank argues that was then and this is now, and that the operation
of the private bank has changed considerably in the last few years," Sen.
Carl Levin (D-Mich.) told the committee Nov. 10, 1999. "But the actions
with respect to Mr. Bongo and the Abacha sons occurred in 1998, and it
was just last year when the Federal Reserve told Citibank board members
that the private bank had 'significant weaknesses in internal controls
that expose Citibank to excessive legal and reputational risk.' "</TE>
<TE>Loans Set at $57 Million</TE>
<TE>   Aziz said in an interview that he knew little about United Bank's
Nuhayyan loan, even though minutes of a Sept. 6, 2001, meeting in the
finance minister's office indicated that he wanted the bank to write off
the debts. Eleven senior government and United Bank officials attended
the meeting, which was requested by Khan, the bank president.</TE>
<TE>   Khan circulated a summary of issues concerning the privatization and
set the value of the unpaid Emirates royal loans at less than $57
million, the minutes said. There is no reference to the much larger
figure Musharraf cited in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Siddiqui's memo to Khan referred to "a huge remission" on the debts
offered by a previous United Bank president, undercutting the larger
claim.</TE>
<TE>   The bank sued in 1994 to collect the debts, but the case is still
stuck in an Emirates court, according to the Oct. 23 memo, in which
Siddiqui also described meetings with Qamzi, the Emirates emissary.
Siddiqui wrote that even Qamzi questioned the debt remission "when
clearly the bank had a strong case in support of its claim."</TE>
<TE>   "I emphasized that this is a government-owned bank, and this money
belongs to the poor people of Pakistan, and it was therefore not
appropriate for us to sit in judgment with respect to an unfavorable
settlement," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Aziz, the finance minister, suggested writing off the debts as "a
normal business loss," according to minutes of the Sept. 6 meeting. Khan
said the loans could be transferred to a state-run Corporate and
Industrial Reconstruction Corp., created to help make banks more
attractive to buyers by clearing bad loans from the books.</TE>
<TE>   Khalid Siraj, a senior advisor to the finance minister, said the
corporation was not supposed to take on foreign debts because of possible
jurisdictional disputes, according to the minutes. But on April 17, the
government announced the transfer of Middle East loans with "a net book
value" of more than $58 million to the reconstruction corporation. It did
not specify whether the Emirates loans were included.</TE>
<TE>   The move was described as one of several taken to improve United
Bank's valuation and "provide a level playing field to all the bidders."</TE>
<TE>   The Abu Dhabi Group's bid for United Bank is drawing added scrutiny
because Bank Al Falah emerged from the ruins of BCCI. The chairman of
Bank Al Falah, Nuhayyan Mabarak, is also the Emirates' minister of higher
education and scientific research.</TE>
<TE>   A local banker described the Oxford-educated sheik as "a blue-chip
businessman" with an excellent record. But the Nuhayyan family still is
known for its role in the collapse of BCCI a decade ago, when the Bank of
England uncovered fraud of more than $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The royal family provided most of the capital when BCCI opened in the
early 1970s, with Pakistanis serving as the principal managers. In 1990,
just before BCCI collapsed, the Nuhayyans and other Abu Dhabi officials
owned 77% of it.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1992 report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. John
F. Kerry (D-Mass.) and then-Sen. Hank Brown (R-Colo.) showed links
between BCCI and the CIA, including aid to Afghan guerrillas fighting
Soviet troops in the 1980s. Osama bin Laden also had money in BCCI, Kerry
has said amid new calls for measures against international money
laundering after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>

<HD>3 Lebanese Ex-Fighters Given Death</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BEIRUT
</DL>
<LD>A Lebanese military court has sentenced to death in absentia three
former militiamen convicted of collaborating with Israel during its
occupation of southern Lebanon.</LD>
<LD>   Hassan Sheeth, Robin Abboud and Habib Awada received the death penalty
for serving in Israel's proxy militia, the South Lebanon Army, the court
announced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The now-defunct militia helped Israel patrol the southern Lebanese
border zone during its 18-year occupation, which ended in May 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The three men are believed to be among the hundreds of SLA officers
who fled with their families to Israel and other countries after Israel
pulled out of the area.</TE>
<TE>   Eight other men were convicted on the same charges. Three of them were
sentenced in absentia to life in prison, and five others, who were
present, to prison terms ranging from two months to seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Since June 2000, the military court, whose verdicts cannot be
appealed, has sentenced more than 3,000 people to prison terms of up to
25 years for collaboration with Israel. During the same time, about 70
former militiamen have been sentenced to death in absentia for killing or
conspiring to kill Lebanese guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   Since the militia collapsed, more than 2,200 former fighters have
surrendered to Lebanese authorities or been captured.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, a Lebanese man who served a nine-year prison sentence in
Israel for cooperating with anti-Israeli guerrillas was released.</TE>
<TE>   Mahmoud Hamad Hammoud, a former employee at the Italian Embassy in
Beirut, was arrested by SLA militiamen in 1993 and convicted by an
Israeli court of cooperating with Hezbollah guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   Iranian-backed Hezbollah led a guerrilla war against Israel's
occupation of southern Lebanon.</TE>

<HD>Austria Struggles With Sins of Its Past</HD>
<DH>Nazis: As Vienna inters euthanized children's remains, survivors
and relatives say nation has also tried to bury its citizens' crimes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE JAHN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>VIENNA, Austria
</DL>
<LD>Friedrich Zawrel realized he could be the next child on the Nazis'
death list when he peeked from his hospital cell and saw two orderlies
walking toward a hearse with small bodies clamped under their arms.</LD>
<LD>   For another man, Walter Zehetner, the same grisly truth--that the
Nazis killed children they deemed less than perfect--lay hidden at the
bottom of a drawer until 1997. Going through papers after his mother's
death, he discovered that a brother also had been a victim of this
policy.</LD>
<LD>   The Nazis called these human beings "worthless lives." Across Europe,
at least 100,000 people, including 5,000 children, were killed for real
or imagined mental, physical or social disabilities.</LD>
<TE>   Vienna's city government now hopes to close a particularly gruesome
chapter in this book of horrors. It recently buried most of the brains
and other remains of about 600 children who were killed at a city
hospital by the Nazis and used until 1978 for medical research.</TE>
<TE>Remains Used for Years</TE>
<TE>   Now, after a search for relatives of the victims, the last two brains
are being buried Sunday in Vienna's Central Cemetery, at a public service
attended by political leaders and other dignitaries.</TE>
<TE>   Austria has long depicted itself as Hitler's first innocent victim,
overrun and annexed by Germany in 1938. Sunday's ceremony, however,
reflects the now general recognition inside Austria that the country must
accept responsibility for Nazi horrors committed in Austria by Austrians.</TE>
<TE>   "A dark part of our history is being brought to a final and dignified
conclusion," with the burials and other events linked to the killing of
children at the Am Steinhof hospital, Vienna City Councilor Elisabeth
Pittermann said.</TE>
<TE>   But not all wounds are healed.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, the remains of the children were still being used in
medical research more than 30 years after World War II ended.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the bitter knowledge, for survivors like Zawrel, that
some of those linked to the killings survived and even thrived in postwar
Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Typical was Dr. Hans Bertha, the head of Am Steinhof. Although 3,500
adults and children were judged "worthless" and killed by the Nazis under
his tenure, he went on to become a professor of medicine in the southern
Austrian city of Graz after the war, dying in a 1961 car accident without
ever facing justice.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a certain closure through the burials," said Zawrel. "But we
can never forget that some of those responsible for the horrors were
subsequently honored citizens in good standing for decades."</TE>
<TE>Ostracized by Nazis</TE>
<TE>   Zawrel, now 73, experienced those horrors firsthand.</TE>
<TE>   The son of an alcoholic father, he was ordered ostracized at school by
the Nazis because of his "asocial origins." He was brought to Am Steinhof
in 1940 at age 11 after being accused of homosexuality.</TE>
<TE>   Over espresso and marzipan cake at a Vienna coffeehouse, Zawrel spoke
with a gentle smile that belied his ordeal: torture, humiliation,
solitary confinement for four years and the daily fear of death.</TE>
<TE>   "The 'wrap treatment' was one of the worst," he said. Orderlies would
bind him first in two sheets soaked in icy cold water and then two dry
sheets.</TE>
<TE>   "Then they'd leave me, and wait until my body warmth dried the
sheets," he said. "It took two days, and during that time they gave me
nothing to eat or drink."</TE>
<TE>   Another horror was "the dunk." Orderlies grabbed Zawrel by the hair
and slammed his head into a tub of cold water, keeping it there until he
blacked out. Other days brought beatings, "puke injections" or other
torture by the needle, leaving him with a throbbing headache and unable
to walk for days.</TE>
<TE>   Johann Gross, another survivor, remembered "crawling on my hands,
dragging my legs behind me because they were devoid of sensation" after
the injections. "Or I would throw up, again and again."</TE>
<TE>   Did they ever ask their torturers why they were doing this? Zawrel
laughed mirthlessly.</TE>
<TE>   "If you asked you got beaten," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The fear of death, fed by whispered rumors of killings at the
hospital, grew on the day in 1940 when he peeked out of his cell's small
barred window to a yard and saw two orderlies walking to a hearse with
their limp burdens.</TE>
<TE>   "Each had a child clamped under each arm," he said. "[The bodies] were
wrapped up in sheets, but their hands and feet were dangling free.</TE>
<TE>   "As of that day, I knew that they were killing children."</TE>
<TE>   Gross, the other survivor, remembered some infants' being left on
hospital balconies on winter nights, naked or thinly dressed.</TE>
<TE>   The balconies were only 30 to 40 yards from his dormitory, he
recalled. "I heard them whimpering--and then I heard the parents got a
letter saying their child had died of pneumonia."</TE>
<TE>Children Euthanized</TE>
<TE>   For Zehetner, 54, the realization that his brother was one such victim
came much later. Born after the war, he recalled asking his mother about
"Gerli"--his brother who had died in 1942.</TE>
<TE>   A framed photo showed Gerhard laughing in his mother's lap. But when
Zehetner asked about it, his mother would grow tearful and silence his
questions.</TE>
<TE>   The truth was revealed only 55 years after Gerhard's death, when
Zehetner came upon the death certificate his mother had hidden. Issued by
the Am Steinhof hospital, it mentioned "inherited brain illness with
idiocy."</TE>
<TE>   The formal cause of death was dysentery. But hundreds of other
handicapped children died in the clinic of normally treatable causes.
What was really going on, it would emerge later, was large-scale
children's euthanasia. Zehetner says it is clear the Nazi doctors were to
blame.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, authorities gave him his brother's file. In it was a
black-and-white photo of Gerhard naked on the examination table, eyes and
mouth distended with fear.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone there must have decided that this child was not worth keeping
alive," Zehetner said, gazing at the photo.</TE>
<TE>   Gerhard's brain was among those saved. It was on display for decades
for visiting researchers.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the horror, Zehetner, head of the tax department of the city
of Baden, south of Vienna, sees some good coming out of his brother's
ordeal.</TE>
<TE>   "I always was critical of the Nazis," he said. "But, like many others,
I didn't feel that that time had anything to do with me--until I was
suddenly personally involved through Gerhard's death.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I know that we were all involved--as victims, as perpetrators, or
as their descendants."</TE>
<TE>   For Zawrel, the links with past and present are even more intense, in
part because he would one day meet one of the doctors accused of
participating in the killings.</TE>
<TE>   When the war ended, Zawrel emerged from the clinic robbed of an
education. He spent 13 years in prison for theft and other petty crimes.
Before one sentencing in the 1960s, he was ordered to undergo a
psychiatric examination--and found himself facing Dr. Heinrich Gross, a
psychiatrist he remembered administering torture injections at Am
Steinhof.</TE>
<TE>   "His face went pale when I told him where we had last met," Zawrel
recalled. "Then he promised to help me."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Zawrel says he was sentenced to do more jail time, in part on
the basis of an evaluation Gross had written at the Nazi clinic in 1944,
attesting that Zawrel was criminally inclined even as a youth.</TE>
<TE>   The doctor's case was not unusual in a country long reluctant to see
its good name tarnished by the actions of its own citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Like Bertha, the former head of Am Steinhof, Heinrich Gross went on to
make a name for himself in postwar Austria. Basing his research on the
preserved brains of the children killed at the hospital, he published
nearly a dozen articles, received a state award and served as an expert
witness in hundreds of court cases up to the mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   He escaped trial two years ago on accusations of complicity in the
killings of nine children at the hospital by pleading dementia. Now 85,
he lives in seclusion, refuses to give interviews, and will likely never
be tried--a fact, Zawrel says, that is more painful than all the physical
torment he suffered.</TE>
<TE>   "I can live with the demons of the past," he said. "But to know that
he and others like him will never be made to pay--that is a hurt that
will never die."</TE>

<HD>Chinese Women in Suicide Crisis</HD>
<DH>Asia: Rural females in China kill themselves at an extremely high
rate. Access to pesticide cited.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN FACKLER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SUXIAO, China
</DL>
<LD>For Yu Weiqun, marriage meant eight years of long days in the
family wheat field and nights of cooking and cleaning. Her husband, often
jobless, still complained she didn't do enough.</LD>
<LD>   The breaking point came in October, when Yu found he had borrowed the
equivalent of three years' pay without telling her. She struck back the
only way she knew how--by drinking paraquat, a deadly pesticide.</LD>
<LD>   "I was desperate. I thought to myself: 'Let me die. See what he can do
then,' " says the 34-year-old Yu, who survived after village health
workers pumped her stomach.</LD>
<TE>   China has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, with some
290,000 deaths a year. And in contrast to the rest of the world, where
men commit most successful suicides, more than half of China's victims
are women--most in the countryside.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese farm women kill themselves at a rate higher than almost any
other group in the world.</TE>
<TE>   In the most comprehensive study to date, an article published recently
in the British medical journal The Lancet estimated 157,000 Chinese women
die by suicide every year. The report, based on government statistics
from 1995 to 1999, found suicide is the leading cause of death for
Chinese under age 35.</TE>
<TE>   China's suicide rate of 21 deaths per 100,000 people annually is above
Japan's 18.8 rate and almost double that of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But the rate among rural Chinese women under 40 years old is 67 per
100,000, said Ji Jianlin, a researcher at Shanghai Medical University. He
said they are three times as likely to die by their own hand as men the
same age.</TE>
<TE>   One possible reason: pesticide.</TE>
<TE>   Women who live on Chinese farms have ready access to powerful poisons.
Unlike Yu, most who attempt suicide by swallowing poison often live too
far from medical help to be saved.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, while the rate of Chinese suicide attempts accounted for by
women is comparable to that in the United States--three-quarters of all
attempts--they succeed in far greater numbers, Ji said.</TE>
<TE>   Another possible factor is the deep-seated Chinese bias that women are
worth less than men.</TE>
<TE>   Rural women are still treated as the property of their fathers and
husbands. Arranged marriages remain common in many areas, as is the
kidnapping of women for sale as wives. Abortions of female fetuses are
also widespread.</TE>
<TE>   "In rural villages, girls aren't made to feel wanted or loved. They
never feel their life is valuable," said Song Liya, editor of China
Women's News, a state-run newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Song said she has written about dozens of suicide attempts over the
last five years.</TE>
<TE>   The youngest involved a 15-year-old girl in the central province of
Hubei who drank pesticide after her father forced her to drop out of
school and started beating her.</TE>
<TE>   The girl, whom Song didn't identify, had to help her mother do all the
farm and housework after her father married off her sister to a much
older man. She couldn't stand the idea of living like her sister and
mother, Song said.</TE>
<TE>   The girl survived the dose of pesticide because her parents rushed her
to the village clinic.</TE>
<TE>   "She told me that she had been tired of life for a long time," said
Song. "She said life is meaningless."</TE>
<TE>   That suicides are even mentioned in official publications like Song's
points to a greater openness in China, where just a decade ago the issue
was considered a failure of the socialist system and too shameful to
mention.</TE>
<TE>   The Ministry of Health plans to fight suicides by limiting access to
pesticides, a step that could halve the number of deaths, said a ministry
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   But experts say rural women need other help, particularly counseling.</TE>
<TE>   When Shanghai opened a suicide hot-line in 1990, half of the 35,000
users in the first seven years were rural women, many calling
long-distance, said Ji, the Shanghai researcher.</TE>
<TE>   Suicide attempts should be seen as desperate appeals for help, health
workers say.</TE>

<HD>Anti-Le Pen Protests Relentless in France</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>At least 200,000 protesters marched in Paris and other French
cities Saturday in a persistent show of anger at far-right presidential
candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen's surprise success in the first round of
voting last weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Protesters in the capital chanted "Down with the National Front"--Le
Pen's nationalist, anti-immigration party. Some beat on drums. One held a
sign that read simply, "I'm ashamed."</LD>
<LD>   Protesters have taken to the streets every day since Le Pen came in
second with nearly 17% of the vote last Sunday, qualifying for a May 5
runoff against President Jacques Chirac and stunning people in France and
abroad.</LD>
<TE>   "We immigrants are afraid," said Tarik Fadili, a 17-year-old high
school student who came to France from Morocco when he was 6. "For Le Pen
to be in the second round means that a good part of France thinks the
same as he does. It makes me sick."</TE>
<TE>   France Info radio put the number of demonstrators throughout the
country at more than 200,000 on Saturday. A protest in Grenoble, at the
foot of the Alps, drew 20,000, police said, while 15,000 gathered in the
Mediterranean port city of Marseille. About 45,000 people marched in
Paris, police said.</TE>
<TE>   About 2,000 police were deployed in Paris, but the demonstration was
peaceful.</TE>
<TE>   If elected, Le Pen says, he will try to cut France's ties with the
European Union and limit immigration, calling last week for "transit
camps" to hold illegal immigrants before they are deported.</TE>

<HD>Colombia's Peasant Insurgency Makes Inroads in Big City</HD>
<DH>S. America: Urban attacks are on the rise two months after
government broke off peace talks with rebels.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>Lars Hagg remembers that he had bought an ice cream for his
5-year-old daughter and that they were heading home along the uneven
pavement of this capital city's congested Seventh Avenue. Then, as they
passed a bookstore, the ground beneath them exploded.</LD>
<LD>   "It all happened in 10 seconds," Hagg recalled. "The bomb was inside a
manhole, and we were right on top of it. A gentleman helped me to lift
the manhole lid off my child, and then he fainted."</LD>
<LD>   Hagg's injuries were light, but his daughter, Carolina, was rushed to
a hospital in critical condition with a fractured skull and a mangled
arm.</LD>
<TE>   The April 9 incident was one of a growing number of urban attacks that
have pitched urban Colombians into the center of a deepening civil
conflict. Two months after the government abandoned peace talks with
Marxist rebels in the southern jungles, experts say, the guerrillas are
bringing their peasant insurgency north to city streets.</TE>
<TE>   The bombs have ripped through nightclubs and restaurants and torn up
city streets, killing and maiming dozens of civilians. Almost all the
attacks have been blamed on Colombia's oldest and largest rebel group,
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, military analysts say the violence is likely to escalate
in the run-up to May 26 presidential elections as the FARC sends a
message of military might to the candidates. Others characterize the
rebels' terrorist campaign as a brutal attempt to pressure the state into
a new round of negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   But although the FARC's motives remain murky, it is clear that the
group's popularity has dipped to new lows.</TE>
<TE>   "What reason can you have for attacking a girl who is 5 years old?"
said Hagg, a Swedish jewelry maker who settled in Colombia eight years
ago. Doctors expect Carolina to make a full recovery, but her fears
linger. She's afraid that a new bomb will kill her father when he's not
with her.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is pardon for this," Hagg said.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Hagg was being rushed to the hospital, police deactivated two
more bombs made of cooking-gas cylinders just blocks from Bogota's
presidential palace.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, FARC fighters disguised themselves as a bomb squad and
kidnapped 13 provincial lawmakers from a legislative assembly in the city
of Cali. In what has become common fare for Colombian newscasts, a police
guard was shown dragging a bloodied fellow officer from the scene. The
injured officer later died of stab wounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Cali kidnappings fit into a scheme of stepped-up political
kidnappings. Hoping to swap their high-profile prisoners for jailed field
commanders, the rebels are holding independent presidential candidate
Ingrid Betancourt, as well as a state governor abducted last weekend as
he led a peace march through the countryside.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, suspected FARC militias also planted a double
charge along a strip of nightclubs in Villavicencio, 45 miles southeast
of the capital. Police said the first explosion was meant to draw more
spectators to the scene before the second bomb blew up. The blasts killed
10 people and injured more than 70.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day, innocent people die," said one woman who was evacuated
from an apartment building in Bogota's city center recently when police
found an unexploded bomb on a neighbor's patio. She didn't want to be
identified because she fears for her life. "What's the use of having a
peace process with them [the FARC]? People who have been killing forever
won't stop just because you ask them to."</TE>
<TE>   Colombian President Andres Pastrana abruptly ended a 3-year-old peace
process with the FARC in February after the rebels hijacked an airliner
and kidnapped a senator who was aboard. The talks had failed to diminish
rebel violence in the countryside and were largely seen as a failure.</TE>
<TE>   For Bogota's eccentric philosopher-mayor, Antanas Mockus, the FARC's
entry into urban terrorism comes partly as a reaction to the peace
negotiations and their collapse. During those talks, veteran rebel
commanders had glimpsed life outside their jungle camps, the mayor said,
but they weren't tempted to "come down from the mountain."</TE>
<TE>   "I think they came to the edge and looked over the side and said, 'I
don't see myself there. I'm too different compared to what's on offer,' "
Mockus said. The 17,000-strong guerrilla group recruits most of its
fighters among the rural poor and has made repeated demands for
agricultural reforms. But the rebels' long-standing involvement in
cocaine trafficking and kidnapping has muddied their reputation among
ordinary Colombians.</TE>
<TE>   Others say the FARC bombings are a sign of weakness. Flush with
hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid, the Colombian army appears
to have gained a military advantage over the FARC, while illegal
right-wing paramilitary fronts carve into rebel territory.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, experts say, the FARC is operating in smaller units and
strengthening ties to urban militia members.</TE>
<TE>   "The FARC want to win their battles without actually fighting them,"
said a military official who requested anonymity. "Terror attacks are
easy to pull off."</TE>
<TE>   Looking to the political implications of the FARC bombings, analysts
say the rebels appear bent on creating a chaotic atmosphere ahead of the
presidential election. On April 14, a bomb detonated alongside the
motorcade of leading independent presidential candidate Alvaro Uribe
Velez in the coastal city of Barranquilla. Four people died in the blast.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe, who escaped unharmed, has risen to the top of polls with
promises to crack down on FARC intransigence and expand the military's
fighting force.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal isn't to interfere with elections--the goal is to make it
impossible to have elections," said one analyst who also requested
anonymity. He added that the rebels "simply want to have as much power as
possible, by any means possible."</TE>
<TE>   If urbanites also feel that the war is at their doorstep, the theory
goes, they are more likely to pressure elected officials into opening a
new peace process with the FARC.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by preelection polling results, however, the FARC's bombing
campaign might backfire. Outrage over the attacks has served as jet fuel
for Uribe's campaign: He maintains a huge margin over second-place
candidate Horacio Serpa.</TE>

<DL>MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay
</DL>
<LD>Floods in Uruguay have forced more than 3,600 people to evacuate
their homes and cut off major highways in the middle of harvest season,
government officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The small, mostly agricultural South American nation of 3 million
people has been pounded by rains through much of April on the heels of
its rainiest March in 100 years. The heaviest rains have been in the
north and northeast, bordering Brazil.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of hectares of farmland have had their crops ruined since
March because of the floods.</LD>
<TE>   "There are a total of 3,666 people evacuated in the whole country and
about seven highways where the rivers are so high you can't get through,"
said a government official. As recently as Thursday the number of people
evacuated was only 2,500.</TE>

<LD>Space tourist Mark Shuttleworth, a South African millionaire and
his continent's first astronaut, boarded the International Space Station
on Saturday after a two-day trip through space on a Russian craft.</LD>
<LD>   Shuttleworth, the second man to pay Moscow a reported $20 million for
a trip to the space station, spoke with South African President Thabo
Mbeki on a video link as part of Freedom Day celebrations marking the end
of apartheid.</LD>
<LD>   "I have truly never seen anything as beautiful as the Earth from
space, and I can't imagine anything that can surpass that," Shuttleworth
said.</LD>
<TE>   Mbeki thanked the 28-year-old for his research into the AIDS virus
plaguing South Africa and for setting an example. "I'm quite certain this
will go down in history as one of the moments when we made a big leap
forward," Mbeki said at the Free State Rugby Stadium, about 242 miles
southwest of Johannesburg.</TE>

<HD>Arab-Israeli Solution Exists, but Peace Remains Elusive</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>From Tel Aviv to the Gaza Strip, the mood these days is full of
gloom as two peoples contemplate the future with anger, fear,
uncertainty. Israelis and Palestinians alike say that the
fight-negotiate-fight scenario has gone on for 54 years and that nothing
seems to have changed.</LD>
<LD>   But the fact is, everything has changed.</LD>
<LD>   When the Arab League met in Khartoum, Sudan, in 1967, its members
passed a resolution on Israel based on three "noes": no negotiations, no
relations, no peace. Last month, the league met in Beirut. It accepted a
Saudi Arabian peace plan and turned the three noes into three yeses. Even
though the league put the onus on Israel, such an offering, based on an
exchange of land for peace, would have been heretical in the Arab world a
generation ago.</LD>
<TE>   "What's different this time around is that for the first time in 50
years, there is a solution--almost everyone accepts two states--and that
is a vast difference," said Judith Kipper, a Middle East specialist with
the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon or Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat has the capacity and creativity to capitalize on
that change is another matter.</TE>
<TE>   Most Israelis think that Arafat is the same man who in 1982 said, "War
is the only way." And most Palestinians think that Sharon is the same man
who in 1985 said the only thing Palestinians would get in exchange for
peace was peace--but not one Israeli concession and not one inch of
Israeli land.</TE>
<TE>   On both sides, attitudes have hardened. "Until last month, I was all
for Arabs and Israelis getting closer, but after what happened in the
West Bank, I could never support Arafat sitting down with the Israelis to
negotiate," said Abed Salam, a Palestinian who runs a media company in
the Gaza Strip. "And this is from someone who's not politically involved,
who has never lost a relative in the wars with Israel, who has a nice
house and is earning a lot of money."</TE>
<TE>   "Everywhere Arafat goes, there's trouble," countered Cobi Schelf, an
Israeli who owns a coffee shop in Jerusalem. "Jordan, Beirut, the West
Bank. Everywhere. He thrives on violence. You can't negotiate with him
because you can't trust him."</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, in his address to the Israeli
parliament, the Knesset, during his historic trip to Jerusalem in 1977,
said the biggest obstacle to peace was "the psychological barrier" of
fear and distrust. His presence in the Jewish state was a giant step in
breaking down that barrier, particularly among Israelis. Now it has been
rebuilt, perhaps higher than ever.</TE>
<TE>   To emphasize Israel's vulnerability in a land where Jewish settlements
are within a stone's throw of Palestinian villages, the Israeli military
took five foreign journalists on a helicopter ride, flying over the
unmarked green line that separates Israel proper from the West Bank,
captured in the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   On the roads below, traffic was backed up at checkpoints, and it was
difficult to know where the freedom of movement of one people ended and
the other's began.</TE>
<TE>   "The Oslo accords were based on the premise Israel was going to have
peace and the Palestinians weren't going to resort to violence," Capt.
Jacob Dullah said, referring to the 1993 agreement that returned some
land to the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the closeness of everything and the geographical realities,
it's almost impossible for Israel to have a hostile state in the West
Bank," he said. "It's because of the proximity that the Palestinians have
been able to inflict terrible damage on Israel. So if there's not peace,
the Oslo accords aren't viable for Israel."</TE>
<TE>   In Jerusalem, shopkeeper Carmela Cohen said: "Everyone's afraid. We're
totally vulnerable." She said that if she sees someone who looks like a
Palestinian parking on the street outside, she immediately calls the
police. And in Nablus in the West Bank, the Palestinian director of
Watani Hospital, Anan Masri, said of the Israelis, "I think they want to
kill us all, but we will not die easily."</TE>
<TE>   There are, however, a few people who see, beyond the gloom, what Moshe
Amirav calls "an unprecedented opportunity for resolving the Middle East
conflict." It involves risk in exchange for potential reward. And for
Israel, Amirav says, it involves painful concessions that would mean
abandoning some of the 140 settlements that house about 200,000 Jews and
are at the heart of Israel's insecurity and the Palestinians' discontent.</TE>
<TE>   Amirav was an advisor to then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak at the failed
Camp David negotiations two years ago. He said the differences that
prevented an agreement were small. In dispute, Amirav said, were 5.4% of
the West Bank, less than a square mile in Jerusalem and the precise
number of Palestinian exiles who would be granted the right of return to
their original homes, with Israel suggesting 30,000 and Arafat wanting
300,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this an unbridgeable gap?" he asked as he sat on the patio of his
hilltop home outside Jerusalem, in the village where Christians believe
that John the Baptist was born. "It's not, of course. And one day, just
as you Americans decided in Vietnam, 'Enough is enough,' everyone in this
conflict will say, 'Enough is enough.' With the Arab League resolution,
we have a rare opportunity in which the return is high and the price, for
Israel, is worthwhile."</TE>
<TE>   Amirav, together with Barak's former chief security advisor, Danny
Yatom, and Middle East expert Joseph Ginat, are floating "a practical
interim agreement" that includes giving up all Jewish settlements in the
Gaza Strip and the isolated ones in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   They advocate the establishment of a Palestinian state on 65% of the
land in the former occupied territories, setting up a Palestinian
municipality in East Jerusalem and erecting a border fence to separate
Israel and a Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Sharon said during a Cabinet meeting that he will not
consider dismantling a single Jewish settlement, not even the most remote
and isolated ones in the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the last Israeli optimist," Amirav said. "Mine is a voice in the
desert today. In the current atmosphere, no one hears me. But even with
the shooting, we're getting closer to the moment of truth when peace is
obtainable."</TE>

<HD>Firms Work to Put Employees on the Road to Wellville</HD>
<DH>Business: Companies are using more carrot, little stick, with
exercise programs, perks to lower costs and keep employees healthier and
happier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEXANDRA R. MOSES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Margaret Brady and her co-workers at Morrissey &amp; Co. practically
have to chase after their boss when they join him for walks along
Boston's Charles River.</LD>
<LD>   The two- to three-mile jaunts are CEO Peter Morrissey's version of an
employee wellness program for his 11-worker public relations firm.</LD>
<LD>   "The 45 minutes to the hour that I'm out, I just feel that . . . the
cobwebs that you get after the coffee buzz wears off are gone," Brady
said.</LD>
<TE>   As health care costs increase, a rising number of companies are using
workplace wellness programs to improve employees' health and reduce
medical claims. These programs generally provide health information, and
many also offer free or low-cost services such as medical checkups and
weight-management and smoking-cessation classes. Some include fitness
centers or subsidized memberships to local gyms.</TE>
<TE>   One factor in rising health costs is Americans' growing tendency
toward obesity. Moreover, said David Hunnicutt, president of the Wellness
Councils of America, "The vast majority of Americans spend the vast
majority of time at work. And it's sedentary."</TE>
<TE>   Health experts say it's incumbent on employers to find ways for
workers to get exercise and information about their health.</TE>
<TE>   Many companies agree. So auto workers at General Motors Corp. relax
and stretch with yoga and Tai Chi classes offered just floors above the
assembly lines in Flint, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Union Pacific Railroad employees can use a fitness center at even the
most remote spots; the company used to have traveling fitness rail cars
before workers started staying in hotels.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler Group offers incentives for its employees to use its
programs, giving out "well bucks" that can be redeemed for gym bags, golf
balls and other gear. Employees earn the well bucks if they get a health
screening, check out a book or video from the company's healthy life
library or get a workplace massage.</TE>
<TE>   Morrissey pays for half the cost of his employees' walking shoes. He
also offers an office bicycle for those who don't want to walk.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, honestly, I thought, 'I have to get out there, I have to
hurry, I have to get back,' " Brady said of the three-day-a-week walks.
But without them, she said, her chances to exercise are "slim to none."</TE>
<TE>   A National Center for Health Statistics report released earlier this
month said seven in 10 adults don't exercise regularly and nearly four in
10 aren't physically active at all.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a federal government survey in 2000 found that 56.4% of
Americans are overweight. Obesity can result in higher health claims and
employee absenteeism.</TE>
<TE>   Companies say wellness programs have proved effective, with reductions
in blood pressure, smoking and cholesterol levels.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,000 people participated in Cigna's weight-management program
last year, and the average weight loss was 10 to 15 pounds, said
Catherine Hawkes, assistant vice president of the insurer's employee
health and work-life programs.</TE>
<TE>   Roughly half of companies that have more than 750 employees offer a
comprehensive employee health promotion program, according to a National
Worksite Health Promotion Survey from 1999, the most recent year such a
survey was done.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the data needs to be interpreted carefully. For example, a
company could send out a health newsletter and say it has a wellness
program. Or, it could have a fitness center, but not encourage employees
to use it.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Hiam, CEO of the consulting firm Alex Hiam &amp; Associates, said
employers sometimes use wellness programs as recruiting tools, touting
gyms, masseurs and yoga classes, but do little to promote their actual
use or find out if employees really want those things.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd favor fewer bells and whistles and [have] simpler programs that
people really use," Hiam said.</TE>
<TE>   The Wellness Council's Hunnicutt said that, although more companies
have wellness programs, they could do better. And Jack Mohen, with the
Boston office of the recruiting company MRI, said he doesn't think
companies really are all that concerned about wellness.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're zoning out on it," Mohen said. "The corporate culture
today is, '[Workers] should thank their lucky stars they still have a
job.' "</TE>
<TE>   But Cigna's Hawkes argues that having programs just makes good sense.</TE>
<TE>   For its work force, which is 78% female, Cigna offers a breast-feeding
support program.</TE>
<TE>   "Mothers who come back to work and breast feed miss fewer days of
work," Hawkes said.</TE>
<TE>   At KWE Associates, a small New York public relations firm, employees
can sign up for a monthly 20-minute massage. Whether the massage has an
actual health benefit isn't necessarily that important, employee Agatha
Gogol said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just the idea that the people you are working for are geared and
motivated about that," she said. "They're thinking about your . . .
wellness and they're not just 'work, work, work.' "</TE>

<HD>From Jewish Outlook, Media Are Another Enemy</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Criticism of TV and newspaper coverage is increasingly
aggressive and widespread--and some of it is warranted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SHAW</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major Jewish organizations and other supporters of Israel in this
country have increasingly bombarded newspapers in recent weeks with
charges of biased reporting on hostilities in the Mideast.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles, almost 1,000 subscribers to The Times suspended home
delivery of the paper for one day to protest what they called inaccurate,
pro-Palestinian coverage. In New York, many in the Jewish community are
calling for a reader boycott of the New York Times.</LD>
<LD>   In Minneapolis, an organization called Minnesotans Against Terrorism
bought a full-page ad in the Star Tribune to accuse that paper of
refusing to call Palestinian suicide bombers "terrorists."</LD>
<TE>   Michael Getler, ombudsman for the Washington Post, says he's been
receiving more than 100 e-mails and calls a day, "the overwhelming
majority saying our coverage is pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Ned Warwick, foreign editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer, says his
paper has been subjected to "an intense barrage of criticism" from the
local Jewish community--"100, 120 e-mails a day, a very sophisticated,
ongoing campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Editors deny charges of bias in their papers, and several have met
with members of the Jewish community to discuss the issue. The editors
say their staff members realize how sensitive the Mideast situation is
and they insist their papers make every effort to be evenhanded.</TE>
<TE>   "We are fallible but we're not biased," says Timothy J. McNulty,
associate managing editor for foreign news at the Chicago Tribune. "A
newspaper, as a human institution, can make mistakes. . . . But the
mistakes are honest mistakes, not a product of bias in any fashion."</TE>
<TE>Major Jewish Rallies Ignored</TE>
<TE>   Several papers have made mistakes--of either omission or
commission--in recent weeks, and that has intensified the perception in
the Jewish community that the coverage is biased against Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Los Angeles Times and the San Francisco Chronicle, for
example, failed to cover major Jewish rallies in their respective cities,
and Jewish leaders excoriated them for it. Executives at the Minneapolis
Star Tribune say the decision to excise and replace the words "terrorism"
and "terrorists" in a New York Times New Service story early this month
was made by an editor who "misinterpreted" the paper's policy of taking
"extra care" in using those words.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very embarrassed," says Ben Taylor, vice president for
communications at the paper. "The wire editor didn't fully understand the
policy and he didn't follow it."</TE>
<TE>   McNulty says a similar policy at his paper is born of a desire to "be
specific and avoid labels," but Jewish leaders say suicide bombings are
acts of terrorism, and members of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah and Al
Qaeda are terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Louis I. Gelfand, reader representative at the Star Tribune, says much
of the criticism that newspapers have received for their Mideast coverage
in recent weeks reminds him of criticism he has heard over coverage of
abortion.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it has to do with language," he says. "People on each side
got upset if we used 'right to life' or 'pro-choice.' "</TE>
<TE>   Now, supporters of Israel complain that newspapers sometimes refer to
Palestinians as "militants" or "freedom fighters" or "guerrillas" instead
of calling them "terrorists" and that they describe the West Bank as
"occupied territory" rather than "disputed land."</TE>
<TE>   Arab Americans and other supporters of the Palestinians take the
opposite view, both on terminology and on Mideast coverage in general,
and they have long accused U.S. news organizations of slanting their
coverage in favor of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "It's misleading, sloppy coverage that does not relate the true
suffering of the Palestinian people," says Ahmed Bouzid, president of the
Philadelphia-based Palestine Media Watch.</TE>
<TE>Pro-Israel Criticism Picks Up After Offensive</TE>
<TE>   Some Palestinian supporters blame Mideast coverage on "Jewish
domination and control" of many major news organizations--and on what
they see as a desire of those organizations to align themselves with U.S.
foreign policy, which has traditionally backed Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Editors have denied those charges as well.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of Israel have criticized the media periodically in the
past--perhaps most aggressively over coverage of Israel's invasion of
Lebanon in 1982. But editors and readers' representatives at many
newspapers say the criticism has been especially vigorous and voluminous
since Israel launched its West Bank offensive last month after a series
of Palestinian suicide bombings killed dozens of Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the criticism is directed at television because of the power
of its visual images.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have pictures of people throwing rocks at tanks, the side
with the tanks gets the worst press," says Robert Lichter, president of
the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say newspapers often have failed to do what they should do
best: put events such as Israel's offensive into the proper historical
context. They also complain that the news media have paid more attention
to the suffering of the victims and survivors of the Israeli offensive
than to the victims and survivors of Palestinian suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Post published "powerful stories about Palestinian
suffering" from Israeli offensives, the Post's ombudsman wrote in an
April 7 column, but the paper did "less well in capturing the impact of
[suicide bombings] . . . on Israeli families and society."</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Downie Jr., executive editor of the Post, says that imbalance
was not intentional but the result of having "so many of our reporters
covering the military action on the West Bank."</TE>
<TE>   The Post dispatched reporter Glenn Frankel to Israel, and he
subsequently wrote two long Page 1 stories about the effect of suicide
bombings there.</TE>
<TE>   Still, criticism of the Post--and of other newspapers--has continued
and even intensified. Emotions on both sides are raw.</TE>
<TE>   "The complaints have really ratcheted up," says Lillian Swanson,
assistant managing editor and ombudsman at the Philadelphia Inquirer. "I
came to work [Wednesday] . . . and I couldn't do anything but answer
calls and e-mails attacking us for a 'remarkably biased approach' on a
story we ran on Page 1 about Israeli soldiers who allegedly trashed a
Palestinian cultural center in Ramallah."</TE>
<TE>   The story quoted the director of the center as saying, "This was not a
security operation. It was just vandalism, part of a conscious desire to
ruin everything Palestinian." She estimated that it would cost $5,000 to
repair the damage, and this prompted Giora Becher, the Israeli consul
general in Philadelphia, to complain, "There is a war taking place, and
$5,000 worth of damage is worth a front-page article?"</TE>
<TE>   Warwick, the foreign editor, attributes some of the Jewish community's
criticism to "their own apprehension about what's taking place" on the
West Bank--and to their realization that "Israel is losing in the court
of world opinion right now."</TE>
<TE>   American Jews sympathetic to Israel "feel helpless to do anything
about what's going on there," Warwick says. "The one thing they can do is
try to influence their hometown paper, so that's what they're trying to
do."</TE>
<TE>   Other journalists say the speed and reach of e-mail and the Internet
have played a major role in growing Jewish criticism.</TE>
<TE>   "Readers are hearing directly from friends or relatives in Israel and
the occupied territories who tell them what's happening in e-mails before
the L.A. Times and the New York Times and CNN can even get in there to
see or confirm anything," says Dan Hortsch, public editor of the Portland
Oregonian, "and then they want to know why we didn't have that story."</TE>
<TE>   Sanders LaMont, ombudsman at the Sacramento Bee, says he senses "more
intensity, more polarity in readers' complaints of late." He adds: "The
big difference is that people who have strong feelings have found sites
on the Internet that they agree with--newspapers in Europe or Israel or
other sources.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll say, 'Why didn't the Bee run this story that Ha'aretz [the
Israeli newspaper] ran about that terrible thing the Palestinians did in
Tel Aviv . . . and they're convinced that they're right."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, LaMont says, readers "get upset because we'll run a story
about a protest or rally in Washington, D.C., and run nothing or only a
very short story on a rally that took place right here." Readers are
often convinced that such decisions are proof of bias.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Times ran into precisely that reaction when it failed
to cover the Israel Independence Day Festival in Van Nuys on April 21
(after having covered the Independence Day celebration in Israel four
days earlier). The Van Nuys event, which doubled as a rally to support
Israel in the current conflict, was covered by most other media in town
and drew more than 40,000 people, including the governor and the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Times editors say misjudgment and miscommunication led to The Times'
failure to cover the event.</TE>
<TE>   "We should have covered it, and it's inconceivable to me that we
didn't . . . but it wasn't deliberate," says Miriam Pawel, The Times
assistant managing editor for local and state news.</TE>
<TE>   John Carroll, editor of the paper, agrees. "If we didn't want to cover
Israel's Independence Day, we wouldn't have had a reporter cover Israel's
Independence Day in Israel," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Local Jewish leaders have long been critical of The Times, and they
see this latest incident as evidence of "an increasing negative bias
against Israel . . . that makes more and more people question if there is
a conscious decision at The Times to portray Israel in a negative light,"
says John Fishel, president of the Jewish Federation of Greater Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The weekly Los Angeles Jewish Journal published a cover story last
year on The Times' coverage of the Mideast and cited criticism from
"significant swaths" of the Jewish community. Rob Eshman, editor in chief
of the Jewish Journal, says feelings are running even more strongly
against The Times now.</TE>
<TE>   "In recent discussions with very reasonable people in the community .
. . the anti-Times rhetoric dominates conversation," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll says he has encountered criticism from Jewish communities at
each of the four newspapers where he has been an editor--in Baltimore,
Philadelphia and Lexington, Ky., as well as Los Angeles--"dating back to
the 1967 war, every time the situation in the Mideast becomes acutely
distressing.</TE>
<TE>   "We sometimes write as many as 10 or 12 articles about the Mideast in
a single day now, and while any one article might not give a complete
picture, a reader who read them all will receive a very complete and
balanced picture."</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone reads every story in its entirety. As the Jewish
Journal story last year pointed out in criticizing what it called
"skewed" choices of photographs, headlines and photo captions, those
items are "frequently the first and sometimes the only items" a reader
will look at.</TE>
<TE>   "When you start to parse the criticism of The Times, it often comes
down to those items," Eshman says. "They can have a dramatic impact on
readers who already feel under siege.</TE>
<TE>   "They're feeling frustrated by events and feeling the world is ganging
up on them, especially with the growing anti-Semitism in Europe. When
they see something they don't like in their hometown paper, it feels as
if the war has come home to their kitchen."</TE>

<HD>Bush Urges Quick Passage of Trade Package in Senate</HD>
<DH>Economy: Democrats want to link 'fast-track' authority with
assistance for workers who lose jobs because of imports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas
</DL>
<LD>President Bush urged the Senate on Saturday to move swiftly to
approve legislation that would expand his authority to negotiate
international trade agreements.</LD>
<LD>   In his weekly radio address, Bush said the trade promotion authority
"would give me the flexibility to negotiate with other countries to open
their markets and get the best deals for American producers and workers."</LD>
<LD>   The president also signaled support in principle for providing help
for U.S. workers who lose their jobs because of imports, an element that
Senate Democrats say is crucial to winning passage of the legislative
package. And Bush urged approval of separate legislation renewing
preferential trade treatment for the Andean nations of Colombia, Peru,
Bolivia and Ecuador.</LD>
<TE>   With the Senate just beginning a delayed debate on the controversial
trade measures, Bush presented them in the context of national security
concerns and continued economic growth. The Andean measure in particular,
he said, could help turn drug-producing communities toward legitimate
economic activity.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate debate is likely to go to the heart of the argument over
how to open foreign markets to American goods and services while
protecting the American market and jobs from competition from low-wage
nations.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said he favors providing funds to retrain workers who have lost
jobs to overseas manufacturers, but the extent of such assistance is
unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   In his most recent speech on trade, to State Department workers on
April 5, the president had been silent on the issue. The White House has
wanted to handle the measure apart from the trade negotiation
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Trade-displaced workers have received extended unemployment benefits,
vocational training and other government assistance since 1962. The
program expired late last year. In 2000, about 35,000 Americans received
the aid.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats have said they are willing to approve the trade
legislation by Memorial Day, but only if the aid, known as trade
adjustment assistance, is included.</TE>
<TE>   "I recognize that some American workers may face adjustment challenges
as a result of trade," Bush said. "I support helping these workers by
reauthorizing and improving trade adjustment assistance programs."</TE>
<TE>   Anne Womack, a White House spokeswoman, said the president wanted the
two issues--workers' aid and the trade negotiation authority--considered
separately.</TE>
<TE>   Because the argument over how to protect American workers from the
economic threat posed by imports remains unresolved--as is the debate
over the full benefits and risks of removing trade barriers--the Senate
debate is likely to be highly charged. The House has passed the
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The law that allowed the government to negotiate trade pacts that
Congress could approve or reject, but not amend, expired in 1994. The
measure lapsed shortly after completion of the North American Free Trade
Agreement with Canada and Mexico and the overhaul of global trade
regulations that created the World Trade Organization.</TE>
<TE>   President Clinton pushed for renewal of "fast-track" authority during
his second term, and Bush has taken up the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Bush argued that in the 1990s, American exports were responsible for
one-quarter of the nation's economic growth and that the global trade
pact and NAFTA added up to $2,000 to the standard of living of an
American family of four.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is the time to build on this record of success," he said, calling
on the Senate to pass the measure "without delay."</TE>
<TE>   He said the failure to renew the trade negotiation authority, which
was available to his most recent five predecessors, had led the United
States to sacrifice its traditional leadership in trade.</TE>
<TE>   Citing scant U.S. participation in a variety of global trade
agreements, Bush said passage of the expanded authority "will give
America's entrepreneurs and workers and farmers and ranchers a fair shot
at the markets of the world."</TE>
<TE>   It is a point he has made frequently in speeches, and one he tries to
turn to a political advantage as he seeks support for Republican
candidates in states with close Senate races.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the overseas effect of trade pacts, the president said Saturday
that the Andean Trade Preferences Act had given Colombia, Peru, Bolivia
and Ecuador such greater access to U.S. markets that over 10 years they
had reported the creation of 140,000 jobs tied to the exports.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said the legislation, reducing the barriers that exporters from
the four countries face selling certain goods in the United States, also
"helped provide an economic alternative to the production of drugs."</TE>
<TE>   The president called for renewal of the measure before May 16, to
avoid the imposition of import duties for at least 90 days. The House
approved the renewal nearly five months ago. The Andean legislation
expired in December, but Bush temporarily waived tariffs on imports from
the countries until May 16.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day we go without expanding trade is another day of missed
opportunities to strengthen our economy," the president said.</TE>

<HD>Brooklyn Official Hopes to Win by Slimmed Margin</HD>
<DH>Health: Marty Markowitz asks his constituents to 'Lighten Up' in
response to reports of high rates of heart disease deaths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Wearing a blue and gold boxing robe, Marty Markowitz, the
admittedly chubby borough president of Brooklyn, stepped on the scale in
a public ceremony designed not only to put himself but also Brooklyn's
2.5 million residents on a diet.</LD>
<LD>   At 5 feet, 5 inches, Markowitz weighed in at 194 pounds.</LD>
<LD>   That was 11 days ago. By Saturday, he had lost 2 pounds.</LD>
<TE>   It has not been easy.</TE>
<TE>   Markowitz, 57, whose father worked in a delicatessen, yearns for his
favorite foods: cheesecake and bread. In the middle of the night he has
hunger pangs and fantasies--so far unfulfilled--of raiding the
refrigerator.</TE>
<TE>   But he is getting a little help from his friends.</TE>
<TE>   The owners of Junior's, a well-known Brooklyn restaurant praised by
critics for its "serious cheesecake," have passed out his photograph to
all its waiters.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell you, many of the waiters know me already," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the shtick is a serious health concern.</TE>
<TE>   Markowitz decided to turn his new diet into a personal crusade after
hospital administrators told him Brooklyn had a record rate of heart
disease.</TE>
<TE>   Brooklyn led the rest of New York City in deaths from cardiovascular
disease, with 8,493 in 2000, according to the most recent statistics
issued by the city's Department of Health.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to put something together that appeals to everyone in
Brooklyn that we could be on the same page at the same time span,"
Markowitz explained.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the "Lighten Up Brooklyn" campaign, he has established 150
stations in churches, drugstores, gymnasiums, hospitals and recreational
centers where people can be weighed for a contest. The neighborhood that
loses the most pounds in two months gets to fly its flag above Borough
Hall in downtown Brooklyn and a delegation of its dieters will appear on
national television.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge isn't easy.</TE>
<TE>   "Our food is dramatically great . . . with portions that are generous,
to say the least," Markowitz said. "The selections are endless."</TE>
<TE>   An aide was more blunt.</TE>
<TE>   "You could eat yourself into a coma in Brooklyn," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, a group of residents from the Ocean Hill-Brownsville
neighborhood joined Markowitz on a brisk walk around Betsy Head Park.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all fired up," he shouted, greeting a handful of weight-loss
enthusiasts, before setting off around the park. Wearing a T-shirt with
the "Lighten Up Brooklyn" slogan, blue sweat pants and sneakers,
Markowitz strode quickly, leaving some people behind.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a campaign not to become skinnies. . . . It's about being
healthy," he told the small crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Markowitz grew up in a family of big eaters. The table groaned under
the weight of pot roasts, meatballs, hamburgers, fried fish, sour cream,
noodles, pasta, cheese and pancakes.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was growing up, my mother said, 'Eat!' . . . We were
encouraged to eat, eat, eat. Eat was better," Markowitz said Saturday.
"Now it is very hard for me every day. It's a challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Politics can be rough on the waistline. It is not unusual for
Markowitz to appear at two lunch events in a single day. Brooklyn is a
collection of neighborhoods with a caldron of local concerns, which
residents voice with vigor. And woe to the politician who's not there to
listen.</TE>
<TE>   While the offices of New York's five borough presidents have been
stripped of many powers, including a voice in the budget-making process,
Markowitz maintains political heft. After serving 13 terms in the state
Senate, he became president of Brooklyn last year by defeating four
opponents, winning 76% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   The politics of poundage fits nicely with his public image and belief
that a borough president can use his office as a bully pulpit.</TE>
<TE>   He is not alone in his campaign for better health. Philadelphia Mayor
John Street has announced his own plan to narrow his city's waistline.</TE>
<TE>   "He's trim and fit," scoffs Markowitz of Street, "so he talks the talk
but doesn't need to walk the walk.</TE>
<TE>   "Me? I'm the poster boy."</TE>

<HD>Book Names New Suspect in 1954 Sheppard Killing</HD>
<DH>Crime: A writer says an ex-Air Force major killed the doctor's wife
in Ohio. The case drew national attention for years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>That notorious July night remains just a blur to Sam Reese
Sheppard.</LD>
<LD>   Only 7 at the time, Sheppard remembers being awakened from a deep
slumber and rushed from his suburban Cleveland home in a panic by
neighbors--vaguely aware, he says, that "something was terribly wrong."</LD>
<LD>   Sheppard and many other sleuths both amateur and professional have
spent nearly the last half-century trying to figure out exactly what
happened that night when his pregnant mother, Marilyn Sheppard, was
bludgeoned to death.</LD>
<TE>   From one of two new dueling whodunits comes the latest chapter--and
one of the more novel twists--in a mystery that America seems unable to
put down.</TE>
<TE>   In a provocative book due out next month, former FBI agent Bernard F.
Conners uses forensic evidence, an odd bite mark, eyewitness testimony
and other clues to point the finger at a new suspect in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Conners' book, "Tailspin," joins the ranks of thousands of articles,
books, documentaries and movies aiming to solve the 1954 murder. Even the
courts in Ohio have revisited the issue, turning down an appeal a few
months ago from the Sheppard family in their effort to exonerate the
victim's husband, Dr. Sam Sheppard, who served 10 years in prison for the
murder.</TE>
<TE>   Conners argues that the real killer was not Sam Sheppard nor the
couple's much-maligned window washer but rather a handsome,
"bushy-haired" Air Force major named Jim Call who went AWOL and became a
gambler, a burglar, a convicted cop-killer and a fugitive.</TE>
<TE>   Call died in a car accident in 1974, six years after he was released
from Attica prison in New York, but Conners believes that solving the
mystery even now is crucial. "We have a very compelling case. I feel very
strongly that Sam Sheppard should be vindicated," Conners said. "It was
outrageous what happened to him."</TE>
<TE>   Conners' book is already stirring controversy. Some people familiar
with the case are attacking his evidence as thin, while others, including
several prominent law enforcement officials, praise Conners as a
real-life Hercule Poirot.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Reese Sheppard, now 54 and a dental hygienist in Oakland, is among
the believers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we now have a serious suspect who was basically ignored at
the time," the victim's son said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   So begins a fresh round of scrutiny into a case that Sheppard expert
James Neff said "has all the elements."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a case that just shook us up. It was all so powerful. It was
the original media frenzy," said Neff, who published his own book, "The
Wrong Man," in November, concluding that Richard Eberling, the Sheppards'
window washer, was probably the culprit.</TE>
<TE>   With a headline-hungry Cleveland newspaper publisher pushing the case,
Marilyn Sheppard's murder on July 4, 1954, became a national sensation
with decades-long staying power.</TE>
<TE>   There was the shock of a pregnant young wife murdered in her own
bedroom in an elite suburban enclave. There was the arrest of her
handsome husband, a doctor in a prominent medical family that ran a local
hospital. There were his proclamations of innocence--and his insistence
that he had battled a "bushy-haired man" who fled the scene.</TE>
<TE>   There was the defense attorney, F. Lee Bailey, catapulted to fame by
the case. And there was "The Fugitive"--and the legend, often discounted,
that the popular television series and the Harrison Ford film about a
wrongly accused doctor searching for his wife's one-armed killer were
inspired by the Sheppard case.</TE>
<TE>   Long before Charles Manson, O.J. Simpson or Robert Blake, the
allegations against Sam Sheppard led to one of the first great "trials of
the century" in America. "Everyone was asking, 'Did he or didn't he? He's
a doctor, he's so handsome, how could he?' " Neff said.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Sheppard was convicted of murder, but the U.S. Supreme Court
ordered a new trial in 1966 because of the "carnival" atmosphere at the
first one. At his retrial, Sheppard was found not guilty. But the damage
was already done.</TE>
<TE>   The suicides of three Sheppard family members were linked to the
trauma surrounding the killing and conviction, and Sheppard descended
into depression, eventually becoming a pro wrestler by the name of
"Killer" Sheppard. He died in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   Prison "destroyed him," his brother, Stephen Sheppard, a retired
doctor in Oregon, said in an interview. "He came out and turned into a
user of uppers and downers and alcohol and anything else. You go to
prison for 10 years, you come out a convict."</TE>
<TE>   One of the many amateur detectives on the case was Air Force officer
George Warburton. He was convinced that a burglar, Jim Call, who was
briefly questioned in New York about the murder, was involved. Warburton
took his theory to Neff, who was then researching "The Wrong Man," but
Neff wasn't persuaded.</TE>
<TE>   Warburton also sent Conners a batch of material, however, and the
former FBI agent was intrigued.</TE>
<TE>   Conners, a Renaissance man of sorts who built a successful career in
Albany, N.Y., as a businessman, best-selling author, publisher and movie
producer after leaving the FBI, had never been much interested in the
Sheppard case. He never even watched "The Fugitive."</TE>
<TE>   But he thought Warburton might be on to something, and he and his
staff spent much of the last five years dusting off long-lost files,
interviewing witnesses and pursuing leads.</TE>
<TE>   "Tailspin: The Strange Case of Major Call," a 506-page tome that
includes dozens of photo exhibits and detailed addenda, traces the
dramatic bends in Call's life, from his rise as a brash and decorated Air
Force aviator to his swift fall into depression and crime after the 1952
death of his wife from a viral infection.</TE>
<TE>   Conners maintains that, in the midst of a string of residential
burglaries nationwide, Call was visiting his sister in Ohio in the summer
of 1954 and broke into the Sheppards' home.</TE>
<TE>   With Sam Sheppard asleep downstairs, a startled Marilyn Sheppard awoke
to find the burglar in her room, triggering a struggle that ended when
Call struck her on the head repeatedly with his Luger handgun and his
burglar's pry bar, Conners maintains.</TE>
<TE>   Among the key evidence Conners cites are a bite mark on Call's hand
that he believes was made when Sheppard bit her victim, dislodging
several of her teeth; a small scrap of brown leather near the victim's
bed, consistent with Call's Air Force-issue flying gloves; and the
testimony of nine eyewitnesses near the Sheppard home who described a
"bushy-haired figure" fitting Call's description.</TE>
<TE>   Neff, who was raised in Cleveland and can tick off the case's most
minute details, concurs on one issue: Sam Sheppard didn't do it. Other
than that, he doesn't buy Conners' arguments.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an interesting theory, but it's farfetched," Neff said. "The
physical evidence contradicts the Call theory. . . . Marilyn Sheppard was
killed by someone that knew the house and knew her."</TE>
<TE>   So the debate, and the armchair sleuthing, continue.</TE>
<TE>   "The beat goes on," Stephen Sheppard said. "There's no end to this,
and there will never be an end to this until this case is solved."</TE>

<HD>Wright's Sagging Masterpiece of a Home Gets a Boost</HD>
<DH>Architecture: Fallingwater, the landmark residence that juts over a
waterfall, has been reinforced to halt its decline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TODD SPANGLER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH
</DL>
<LD>Fallingwater is falling no more.</LD>
<LD>   After months of work, Frank Lloyd Wright's sagging architectural
masterpiece is standing on its own again with the help of an innovative
system of steel cables buried under the home's stone floors.</LD>
<LD>   Dramatically cantilevered out over Bear Run, Fallingwater still tilts
a little bit toward the bucolic stream but is no longer in danger of
being renamed "Fell-in-water."</LD>
<TE>   The steel supports that have propped up the home for the last five
years while engineers were developing the less-obtrusive solution will be
gone by late summer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to soar again over the waterfall," said Lynda Waggoner,
director of the structure voted "Building of the 20th Century" by the
American Institute of Architects.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the 1930s, when Wright was rewriting the concepts of organic
design with his plans for department store magnate Edgar Kaufmann Sr.'s
vacation home 70 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, there were concerns that
the concrete cantilevers could not hold up the building on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Almost as soon as it was completed in 1937, Fallingwater sagged and
cracks formed in its pale ocher terraces.</TE>
<TE>   Engineers believed it was just settling, but the
cantilevers--reinforced concrete beams that jut out of the hillside and
support the house--slowly continued to dip toward the creek bed.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s someone noticed the structure was in danger of
failing completely. Since 1997, steel beams and girders on the creek bed
have helped hold it up, compromising Wright's vision of the structure as
one practically levitating over the creek.</TE>
<TE>   According to Waggoner, weight transferred from the second floor onto
the first floor made the structure sag by as much as 6 inches in some
places.</TE>
<TE>   The Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, which owns the home, called in
Robert Silman's New York engineering firm to help find a way to shore up
the structure, quietly and unobtrusively.</TE>
<TE>   The plan called for taking up the sandstone floors on the first level
and getting down to the cantilevers themselves. Steel cables were placed
next to the beams, running much of their length and anchored in place
with blocks of concrete poured beside the cantilevers.</TE>
<TE>   Over three days, hydraulic jacks slowly pulled the cables taut with
hundreds of tons of pressure. If the building's structure can be compared
to a human skeleton, the cable system--invisible once the stones covering
the first floor and terrace are laid again--acts like muscles to help
Fallingwater hold itself in place.</TE>
<TE>   The cables lifted the structure about a half-inch above the steel
supports rising from the creek and took pressure off the cantilevers.</TE>
<TE>   The plan has worked. The cracks disappeared. The jacks were removed,
the ends of the steel strands were cut off, and the holes in the walls
where the strands had poked through were patched and painted so that the
system is invisible.</TE>
<TE>   Fallingwater will still point downward. Because so much of the
building had settled that way over the years, any drastic leveling of the
structure could have shattered windows and damaged other sections.</TE>
<TE>   "Those deflections will always be there," Waggoner said. "You don't
notice it as much from the interior of the house as you do from looking
at the exterior."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout some of the work--which is part of an overall $11-million
restoration--people could still visit Fallingwater.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Waggoner said, the flooring is back down inside the house.
Weatherproofing on the terrace will soon be replaced and stones there put
back down.</TE>

<HD>Inmate Seeks to Halt Execution for DNA Tests</HD>
<DH>Courts: Richard C. Johnson's tangled legal saga in South Carolina
is scheduled to end Friday with his death.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A South Carolina man, scheduled to be executed Friday for the
murder of a state trooper, is seeking clemency from Gov. Jim Hodges
because someone else has confessed to the 1985 slaying.</LD>
<LD>   There's no doubt that Connie Sue Hess was at the murder scene, but
last year the South Carolina Supreme Court doubted her credibility--in
part because she has changed her story several times over the last 16
years. In a 3-2 vote, it denied Richard C. Johnson's bid for a new trial,
saying that his lawyers had not demonstrated conclusively that a new jury
would acquit Johnson if they heard Hess' testimony.</LD>
<LD>   One dissenting justice said the decision, in the face of Hess'
confession, constituted "a denial of fundamental fairness shocking to the
universal sense of justice."</LD>
<TE>   Even the state trooper's mother wants Johnson's sentence commuted to
life.</TE>
<TE>   "Killing Mr. Johnson, even if he is guilty, will not bring my son back
and serves no purpose," Thelma Blue wrote the governor. "Killing Mr.
Johnson if he is innocent would be an abomination."</TE>
<TE>   Then, just two weeks before Johnson's scheduled execution, his defense
lawyers stumbled onto the possibility of DNA evidence that could cast
doubt on the testimony of another key prosecution witness. The South
Carolina Supreme Court could decide as early as Monday whether Johnson
will be allowed to pursue DNA testing based on that evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 13 years, 107 people have been exonerated from
convictions in the U.S. as a result of DNA testing--including 12 from
death row. However, no nationwide standard exists for deciding whether an
inmate can obtain post-conviction DNA testing. Twenty-four states have
passed laws giving inmates a right to such testing, but South Carolina is
not among them.</TE>
<TE>   If the governor commutes Johnson's sentence to life, it would be the
first time clemency had been granted in a capital case since South
Carolina reinstated the death penalty in 1976. The state has executed 25
people in the last 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   Many death penalty cases have a long and complicated history. But the
Johnson case is a particularly tangled tale.</TE>
<TE>   The story starts in September 1985, when Johnson met Daniel Swansen,
by most accounts an eccentric businessman, in Morehead City, N.C. The two
set out for Florida in Swansen's motorhome.</TE>
<TE>   Near the South Carolina line, the duo stopped at a rest area. Swansen
picked up two hitchhikers, Hess and Curtis Harbert.</TE>
<TE>   Not long afterward, Swansen and Trooper Bruce Smalls were shot dead,
but who pulled the trigger is in dispute.</TE>
<TE>   According to testimony at Johnson's first trial in 1986, Johnson shot
and killed Swansen inside the motorhome and hid his body under a mattress
in the vehicle. Later the same day, Trooper Smalls pulled over Johnson,
who had been drinking heavily, ingesting a variety of drugs and driving
erratically.</TE>
<TE>   Within moments, Smalls was killed. Johnson, Hess and Harbert attempted
to flee but were soon captured.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities threatened to prosecute all three, but only Johnson was
tried. Harbert and Hess testified that Johnson had shot both men.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was convicted of Smalls' murder and sentenced to death. Then,
in a separate trial, he pleaded guilty to Swansen's murder and received a
life sentence. Johnson said he did not recall what happened because of
his drug-induced state. When Johnson was arrested, his blood-alcohol
level was more than twice the legal limit for driving.</TE>
<TE>   Soon thereafter though, the state Supreme Court reversed Johnson's
conviction in the trooper case, because of improper comments made by the
prosecutor in his closing argument, and ordered a new trial.</TE>
<TE>Johnson's Statement Taken as Confession</TE>
<TE>   Before that trial, Hess told her former lawyer that she wanted to
recant her testimony against Johnson, according to court documents.
Harbert had committed both murders, Hess now said.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney sent a letter to the sheriff in the South Carolina county
where the trio was arrested. But Johnson's attorney was not notified of
this potentially exculpatory information, and Hess' new story did not
become public until years later. Prosecutors did not call Hess to the
stand in the second trial. Rather, they used her testimony from the first
one. Harbert again testified against Johnson, and Johnson was again
convicted of Smalls' murder.</TE>
<TE>   In the penalty phase, Johnson did not specifically address what had
occurred, but he made what prosecutors and the judge took to be a
confession. "I have no defense for anything or the tragedies that
occurred. All I have is a sorrow for the lives that I have ruined."</TE>
<TE>   He was sentenced to death. The South Carolina Supreme Court upheld the
conviction and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson then obtained new lawyers, John H. Blume and Diana L. Holt,
who launched new appeals without success.</TE>
<TE>   Holt said Johnson firmly maintains his innocence. She said the
statement he made in court was an "expression of sorrow for people losing
their loved ones, not a confession. Now it's become like suicide for
saying 'I'm sorry.' "</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, as time was running out for Johnson, Holt went looking for
Hess and found her living in Nebraska. Hess told Holt several stories
about what happened, though in each version she said Johnson was
innocent.</TE>
<TE>   Just eight days before Johnson was to be executed, Hess, against the
advice of an attorney, signed a sworn affidavit in the presence of
several witnesses saying that Harbert had murdered Swansen after having
sex with him and that she had murdered Smalls.</TE>
<TE>   At the earlier trials, Harbert said Johnson had murdered Swansen after
having sex with him.</TE>
<TE>   In light of Hess' confession, the South Carolina Supreme Court stayed
the execution and assigned a judge to review the case.</TE>
<TE>   There was no strong physical evidence against Johnson. When his hands
were tested for gunpowder shortly after he was arrested, no residue was
found, records state. Judge William P. Keesley expressed dismay, however,
at his inability to get access to other evidence collected during the
investigation of Smalls' murder.</TE>
<TE>   Months later, Keesley decided that Hess lacked credibility because she
had changed her story several times and consequently concluded that
Johnson's conviction should be upheld.</TE>
<TE>   The state Supreme Court voted, 3 to 2, to adopt his recommendation in
June 2001, and that seemed to be the end of the legal road for Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Then, a couple of weeks ago, a new twist emerged. Blume and Holt asked
the state Supreme Court to stay Johnson's execution based on "recently
discovered exculpatory evidence believed to be in the possession of the
Medical University of South Carolina," which performed the autopsies in
the Swansen and Smalls slayings.</TE>
<TE>   The defense lawyers, aided by DNA specialist Barry C. Scheck of the
Innocence Project in New York, said in court papers that the evidence had
not been disclosed by authorities until April 12 during the investigation
of "matters under seal in another capital murder case." Johnson's lawyers
are under court order not to say more.</TE>
<TE>   William E. Salter III, a senior assistant attorney general in South
Carolina, maintains that Johnson is not entitled to the DNA tests because
he had an opportunity, through different attorneys earlier in the case,
to obtain the relevant material. In addition, Salter maintains in recent
court papers that Johnson is not entitled to the testing because it
relates only to a collateral issue in the case--whether Harbert or
Johnson had sex with Swansen before he was shot.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's attorneys retort that if the tests show that Harbert had sex
with Swansen it would demonstrate that he had lied at trial.</TE>
<TE>   The autopsy report on Swansen states there are clear signs that he had
anal sex before he was killed.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the Richmond, Va.-based U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals,
which has jurisdiction over South Carolina death penalty appeals, ruled
that there is no constitutional right to post-conviction DNA testing. The
court said that if such a right were to be granted it should come from a
state legislature, not from a federal court.</TE>
<TE>   But Judge J. Michael Luttig issued a long opinion in which he became
the first federal appeals court judge to state that he believes there is
a constitutional right to post-conviction DNA testing.</TE>
<TE>   "A right of access to evidence for tests which . . . could prove
beyond any doubt that the individual in fact did not commit the crime, is
constitutionally required, I believe, as a matter of basic fairness,"
wrote Luttig, a staunchly conservative jurist. Luttig added that the
right to testing is particularly important when a defendant's access to
the courts is precluded because he has used up his appeals and his only
remaining chance is clemency.</TE>
<TE>'There Has to Be a Residual Doubt'</TE>
<TE>   Scheck said he hopes Gov. Hodges will heed that message. Johnson's "is
the toughest kind of case for clemency because it involves the shooting
of a policeman."</TE>
<TE>   But he added, "If there is any case that cries out for clemency based
on residual doubt, this has to be it. When two of the five justices of
the state Supreme Court say Johnson is entitled to a new trial, there has
to be a residual doubt about his guilt.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were the governor, I would want to see the testing done in order
to make an informed clemency decision."</TE>
<TE>   But South Carolina Atty. Gen. Charlie Condon said the case had been
reviewed many times by appellate courts and the execution should go
forward. "The system has really bent over backwards to investigate every
possibility of any evidence that we've got the wrong person," Condon told
a South Carolina newspaper a few days ago. "It's time for justice to be
served."</TE>

<DH>Friendship: Teacher turned Army Ranger wanted her to be all she
could be. When he died in Afghanistan, he left her some of his life
insurance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLEN G. BREED</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>FORT MYERS, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>March 4 was to be one of the best days of Jennifer Massing's life.</LD>
<LD>   She made All-Conference in soccer, her high school teammates voted her
most valuable player, and she won a trophy for having the highest GPA on
the squad, a figure boosted by honors classes to 4.93.</LD>
<LD>   Jennifer, 18, couldn't wait to e-mail the news to Marc Anderson. He
was more than just her former math teacher--he was her coach, her mentor,
her biggest fan, her friend.</LD>
<TE>   "I remember thinking, 'Oh, Marc's going to be so proud of me because I
won these--because I'm able to excel in soccer and in school,' " she
said.</TE>
<TE>   She never got the chance.</TE>
<TE>   While Jennifer was reveling in her achievements, 30-year-old Spc.
Anderson was lying dead halfway across the world on an Afghan mountain.
The teacher-turned-Army Ranger, who had left the safety of the classroom
to pay off his college loans, was killed trying to rescue a Navy SEAL who
had fallen out of a helicopter under fire.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a Ranger who served four tours in Vietnam, Anderson was
committed to the creed that no man be left behind.</TE>
<TE>   As awful as the news was, Jennifer could handle it. But she also had
to deal with the disquieting fact that his death brought her some good
fortune. Anderson's military life insurance policy would help put her
through college.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely did not want the money," Jennifer said, sniffing back
tears. "I wanted him instead."</TE>
<TE>   The way friends saw it, Marc Anderson brought to teaching a kind of
civilian version of the Ranger code: Leave no student behind.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson signed on at Fort Myers Middle School in 1995. From the
beginning, it was clear he was going to do more than just sit behind his
desk from bell to bell.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson was in his classroom long before school started and a couple
of hours after it ended to tutor kids who needed help, whether they were
his students or not. He always brought juice, bagels or doughnuts for his
sunrise scholars.</TE>
<TE>   He was a common sight at weekend baseball and soccer games, and would
often go to children's homes to tutor them. Parents jokingly accused the
bachelor teacher of being in it for the free meals, but the kids knew
better.</TE>
<TE>   "The middle school years are rough," says Meredith Hoek, 18, who met
Anderson in a SAT review course. "You could go to him and he related
well, sometimes better than your parents, because he was younger.</TE>
<TE>   "He just really became kind of a peer and a mentor to all of us. Jen
especially."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson and Jennifer met in 1995 under less-than-auspicious
circumstances, during a faculty/student basketball game. He broke her
finger fighting her for a loose ball.</TE>
<TE>   Colleague David Childress says Anderson saw a lot of himself in the
feisty sixth-grader. "Had Jennifer been a boy, she would have been Marc
reincarnate," he says.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, they were always looking out for others.</TE>
<TE>   When he was a student in high school, Anderson would adopt a freshman
every year and protect him from bullies. Jennifer's Fort Myers High
School soccer teammates jokingly call her "Coach Mass."</TE>
<TE>   Childress says Anderson admired her aggressiveness on the field. He
had been an All-American offensive guard in football at Case Western
Reserve and won Florida State University's 1995 Golden Torch award for
being the student-athlete with the highest GPA.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson went to one of Jennifer's soccer games and noticed she was
running on her heels, not her toes. For weeks afterward, he met her after
school and watched her sprint until she improved her speed.</TE>
<TE>   "He was kind of forcing me to do it, in a way, to help me improve. But
at the same time he was like asking my permission to do it," she says.
"In school, it was teacher to student. After school, it was just a friend
helping out a friend."</TE>
<TE>   When Jennifer moved to seventh grade, Anderson was her math teacher.
Math wasn't her best subject, but he always pushed her to improve--and
liked the way she met the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   One day, Anderson asked Jennifer what she'd like to do with her life.
She said that she'd like to be an architect, but that as a woman, it
probably wasn't practical.</TE>
<TE>   Her lack of confidence hit him like a hammer in the chest.</TE>
<TE>   "His face just went sullen--it just went dull," she says. "He didn't
yell at me. He just made it firm that I can achieve whatever I want to
do. . . . I idolized him for doing that for me and making me become aware
of that."</TE>
<TE>   As Jennifer moved on to high school, and he to the Army, the two
stayed close. Somewhere along the line, Anderson decided he was going to
make sure Jennifer lived up to her potential.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's family convinced him to go to college instead of the
military. His oldest brother, John, was making the Marines a career, and
middle brother Stephen had done eight years in the Army and reserves, so
they figured the baby shouldn't have to go.</TE>
<TE>   But after five years of college, Anderson was nearly $45,000 in debt.
He decided the quickest way to pay it off was to join the military.</TE>
<TE>   Friends wanted him to go into officer's candidate school. But that
wouldn't pay all of his debts in one four-year stint.</TE>
<TE>   So at 27, Anderson was back where he was born, at Ft. Benning, Ga. He
must have been a sight, a 6-foot-3, 225-pound hulk out-sprinting
pimply-faced recruits nine years his junior.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, nobody could beat him," says Russell Zayas, Anderson's
18-year-old roommate in the Ranger indoctrination program. "He was a
powerhouse."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Ranger training, Anderson would talk about the young friend
he was trying to shepherd. Zayas would be on the computer after midnight
when Jennifer would message Anderson with a math problem or a request for
counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Zayas says Anderson was devoted to the girl.</TE>
<TE>   "She was truly, to him, like a daughter," he says. "That's exactly how
he treated her, in every way."</TE>
<TE>   Before Anderson was shipped overseas in December, he went to Tampa to
visit his brother Stephen, who had been diagnosed with terminal colon
cancer. Naturally, they talked about death.</TE>
<TE>   "His biggest worry was me not being here when he came back," Stephen
Anderson says.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Anderson, a management consultant, had been handling his
brother's finances. Marc told his brother he had made some changes to his
life insurance policy, but didn't elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Steve, if something should happen to me, things are going
to be spelled out kind of differently. And I know you'll understand.' "</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's tour was nearing its end and he was planning his return to
civilian life. In fact, he was seeking early release so he could get back
into the classroom this fall; Stephen had assembled an envelope with
applications for teaching jobs across southwest Florida.</TE>
<TE>   He never got to send it.</TE>
<TE>   In early March, U.S. troops were tightening a noose around Taliban and
Al Qaeda holdouts in a mission code-named Operation Anaconda. During one
sortie, a Navy SEAL fell out of a helicopter as it came under enemy
ground fire.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson was considered the best in his battalion with a heavy machine
gun, earning him a spot on the rescue chopper. Sometime after he jumped
out to provide cover fire, he took a bullet.</TE>
<TE>   The young Ranger and six other soldiers died in the nine-hour
firefight. The SEAL they were seeking to rescue had been shot to death.</TE>
<TE>   The morning after her academic and athletic triumph, Jennifer was
called out of class to the guidance counselor's office. She figured they
were going to talk about colleges--until she saw the grim face of one of
Anderson's former colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   She told her mother to put away her trophies.</TE>
<TE>   "They're pointless," she said. "Who cares?"</TE>
<TE>   After Anderson's death, his family learned he had left Jennifer about
$12,000 from his insurance policy. Most of them knew next to nothing of
Jennifer, but none was surprised at the gesture.</TE>
<TE>   Because of Anderson's affection for her, they have taken her into
their hearts.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Anderson received the balance of his brother's benefits. Aware
that $12,000 would cover only about a year's tuition and expenses, he
knew that wasn't the kind of security his brother had wanted for
Jennifer.</TE>
<TE>   So he contacted the Bailey Family Foundation, which helps worthy
students attend college. The foundation agreed to pay the rest of
Jennifer's tuition, relieving some of the burden on her middle-class
parents.</TE>
<TE>   To Stephen, seeing Jennifer succeed is a way of keeping his brother
alive.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a girl he cared about, a student that he thought had a lot of
potential," the brother says.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Anderson's death, Jennifer learned she'd been accepted
to the University of Florida, a school she chose for its architecture
program.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting outside her old middle school near a live oak planted in his
honor, Jennifer says Marc Anderson's dying gift has lightened one burden
but given her another that is perhaps harder to carry--the task of living
up to his faith in her.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, I feel like Marc is with me everywhere," she says, her voice
trembling. "And so he's watching every move."</TE>

<HD>Semen-Smuggling Scheme Halted</HD>
<DH>Prisons: A guard acted as conduit for an inmate and his wife, who
failed to get pregnant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC LEVY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HARRISBURG, Pa.
</DL>
<LD>It must have seemed like a bargain to New York mobster Antonino
Parlavecchio and his wife.</LD>
<LD>   For about two years, they paid a guard at Allenwood Federal Prison
$300 or less per trip to smuggle Parlavecchio's semen from the prison,
where he was doing time for racketeering, to Maria, who was desperately
trying to get pregnant.</LD>
<LD>   But guard Troy Kemmerer turned out to be not much of a bargain after
all.</LD>
<TE>   A woman who said she was the girlfriend of an inmate agreed to pay him
as much as $5,000--a nice bonus on top of Kemmerer's salary of
$35,799--to smuggle out her boyfriend's semen.</TE>
<TE>   It would be the last smuggling deal Kemmerer would pursue at
Allenwood--and extinguished Parlavecchio's hopes of having her husband's
child before she turned 40.</TE>
<TE>   The "girlfriend" was a cop, the "boyfriend" inmate was cooperating
with federal prosecutors, and Kemmerer soon found himself, the
Parlavecchios, and another man charged with running the most unusual of
several different smuggling schemes that authorities were slowly
unraveling at Allenwood.</TE>
<TE>   Kemmerer pleaded guilty to bribery and was sentenced to 27 months in
prison. The others pleaded to less serious charges: Maria Parlavecchio
got a year on probation, her husband got six months in prison, and John
Alite, of Voorhees, N.J., got three months.</TE>
<TE>   To the government, the semen wasn't a big deal; prosecutors were more
concerned with rooting out corruption at the federal prison in the rural
north-central Pennsylvania town of White Deer.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole case wasn't what was smuggled in or what was smuggled out,"
said Michael Pinsky, a Westmont, N.J., attorney representing Alite, who
met Parlavecchio while serving time in Allenwood. "It was important that
there were guards for sale."</TE>
<TE>   The guilty guards, by and large, each served "a personal prisoner who
manipulated them very well," said Wayne P. Samuelson, the assistant U.S.
attorney who is prosecuting the cases.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning with Kemmerer in October 2000, 12 people have been
indicted--including four guards, all of whom pleaded guilty. Ten other
inmates could be indicted as federal agents continue their investigation,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Thermadrine bodybuilding pills, toiletries such as soap and shampoo,
Italian meats and cheeses, and a wristwatch were sneaked into the
low-security wing of the prison, while the filled-up sperm kits--test
tubes containing the sperm and a freezing solution--were smuggled out.</TE>
<TE>   But the semen smuggling was not a profit-making enterprise like the
other schemes, which were the brainchildren of a handful of imprisoned
organized crime figures, defense attorneys said.</TE>
<TE>   "There were certain prisoners who had girlfriends who felt their
biological clocks were ticking and wanted to get pregnant," Pinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Post cited anonymous law enforcement sources as saying
that the investigation began several years ago after a convicted Colombo
family hit man in prison since 1988 was seen in an Allenwood visiting
room showing off a toddler he called "my son."</TE>
<TE>   Samuelson said he couldn't comment about the report, but did say that
it is unclear whether Kemmerer was the only guard to smuggle out sperm
kits from Allenwood. At least one guard may have unwittingly smuggled
sperm kits hidden in bottles of lotion, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Parlavecchio was indicted in December 2000 after at least three
unsuccessful attempts to get pregnant through artificial insemination
with the smuggled sperm.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, when she was in her late 20s, she watched her husband
Antonino, now 37, sentenced to as much as 14 years on racketeering
charges and sent to Allenwood--145 miles from her home in the New York
suburb of Garfield, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Conjugal visits are not allowed, and Parlavecchio was seemingly left
with one option if she wanted to have her husband's child.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of her strong desire to have a child," her attorney, Eugene
P. Tinari of Philadelphia, told the court, Parlavecchio was "a previously
law-abiding citizen taking the risks involved in this case knowing she
was breaking the law."</TE>
<TE>   To get the sperm kits, Parlavecchio, 38, explained to a Minnesota
laboratory that her husband was stricken with prostate cancer and needed
to preserve his semen before undergoing chemotherapy, court documents
say.</TE>
<TE>   Antonino Parlavecchio, who is eligible for release in September 2004,
approached Kemmerer about the arrangement in the summer of 1998. His
friend, Alite, acted as the go-between outside the prison, delivering the
empty sperm kits to Kemmerer and paying him when he returned the filled
kits, according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Parlavecchio was "desperate," Tinari said.</TE>
<TE>   About the time that authorities got wise to the smuggling,
Parlavecchio had tried artificial insemination once in October 1998. That
attempt, and what court documents say were several other later attempts
in her doctor's New York office, apparently were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   Even after she pleaded guilty in August, she asked the government to
let her have the remaining sperm samples that were impounded in her
doctor's office.</TE>
<TE>   A judge denied the request, bringing her case to a close and leaving
her with no child by her husband and no visitation rights.</TE>

<HD>Medgar Evers' Widow Donates Papers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JACKSON, Miss.
</DL>
<LD>Showing how much times have changed, the widow of slain civil
rights leader Medgar Evers donated his papers to the state of
Mississippi.</LD>
<LD>   "This is where they belong," Myrlie Evers-Williams told a racially
mixed crowd Thursday as she gave Evers' letters, speeches and notes, as
well as her own papers and photos, to the state Department of Archives
and History. In all, she gave 55 boxes of materials that will become
available to researchers next year.</LD>
<LD>   Evers, field secretary for the National Assn. for the Advancement of
Colored People, was shot in the back June 12, 1963, while standing in the
driveway of his Jackson home with an armful of "Jim Crow Must Go"
T-shirts.</LD>
<TE>   Evers-Williams, who left Mississippi with the couple's three children
after her husband died, was national NAACP chairwoman from 1995 to 1998.</TE>
<TE>   She said her husband always believed his home state could rise above
its racial division. Mississippi has embraced change in the last four
decades and still has more progress to make, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The state archive houses the papers of Confederate President Jefferson
Davis, but until now it has had no papers from national civil rights
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Evers' killer, Byron De La Beckwith, was freed after two all-white
juries failed to convict him in the 1960s. Then in the early 1990s,
documents of a state spy agency, the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission,
revealed that agents worked to get Beckwith acquitted. He was indicted
again and convicted in 1994. Beckwith was serving a life term when he
died in prison last year.</TE>
<TE>   Former Gov. William Winter, a longtime member of the Archives and
History Board of Trustees, said Medgar Evers "gave his life in his quest
to free us all--black and white folks alike--from the bondage of racial
segregation and discrimination. He was a true hero."</TE>

<DL>ADJUNTAS, Puerto Rico
</DL>
<LD>Beyond narrow roads winding through the mountains of Puerto Rico's
Cordillera Central lies a tropical paradise lush with giant ferns,
philodendrons and pockets of orchids.</LD>
<LD>   Less than a decade ago, this nearly became an eyesore of mile-wide
craters dug in a search for copper, silver and gold. But Alexis Massol, a
58-year-old civil engineer, led a community struggle against the
government and the mining industry to stop the area from becoming an
open-pit mining zone.</LD>
<LD>   Massol's 15-year effort to preserve the forests around his native
Adjuntas is being honored Monday with a Goldman Environmental
Prize--sometimes called the "Nobel of environmentalists," which is
presented each year to eight people.</LD>
<TE>   "This achievement makes me proud to be Puerto Rican. We have assumed
responsibility for our community," Massol said in a telephone interview
from a San Francisco hotel where the $125,000 awards are being presented.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s and 1990s, the government of this U.S. Caribbean
territory granted mining permits for 37,000 acres of Puerto Rico's
central mountain range.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the mining would have affected a third of the island.
Aside from a major loss of forests, toxins likely would have polluted the
Vivi and Pellejas rivers, which supply drinking water to the more than 1
million residents of northern Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   Massol reacted in 1980 by creating Casa Pueblo.</TE>
<TE>   "As a community, we united to break dependency on the government and
determine our own mechanisms to deal with problems," Massol said.</TE>
<TE>   But many feared opposing the government. To attract more supporters,
Casa Pueblo evolved into a cultural center. Massol led his group to
neighborhoods, small-town plazas and schools, and held concerts.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986 and 1993, Casa Pueblo beat back two attempts to mine the
mountain area.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in 1995, Gov. Pedro Rossello signed a law banning open-pit
mining.</TE>
<TE>   Massol sought more protection, and the following year the governor
designated the area as Puerto Rico forest land and handed control to Casa
Pueblo. It was dubbed "the People's Forest."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a 15-year struggle," said Massol. "We took a project of death
and turned it into a project of life."</TE>
<TE>   There is no tradition of private trust of public lands here, said
Ariel Lugo, director of the International Institute of Tropical Forestry
in Puerto Rico. The People's Forest became the island's sole
community-run reserve.</TE>
<TE>   Protected public lands cover 5% of Puerto Rico, an island 100 miles
long and 35 miles wide.</TE>

<HD>Airport Says Saudis Made Sexist Request</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DALLAS
</DL>
<LD>Aides to Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah asked that only male air
traffic controllers guide his flights during his visit in Texas, airport
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Prince Saud al Faisal, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister and a member of
Abdullah's entourage traveling around Texas, called the reports "absolute
nonsense."</LD>
<LD>   Ruben Gonzalez, a manager for the company that operates the control
tower at the Waco airport, said a group of Saudis made the request to the
airport manager. He said two male controllers guided the prince's
afternoon flight to Houston, though a female tower manager was on the
premises.</LD>
<TE>   The Dallas Morning News reported Saturday that a Federal Aviation
Administration employee, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Saudis' request was granted on portions of the prince's flights.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, FAA spokesman Roland Herwig said he was unaware of any
such request. "We have not received an official request from either the
Saudis or the State Department," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After flying into Waco to meet with President Bush at his nearby
Crawford ranch Thursday, the prince flew to Houston, where he took a
train to College Station to tour former President George Bush's
presidential library the next day.</TE>
<TE>   A telephone message left at the Texas State Technical College airport
in Waco was not returned.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where this news came from," Saud said in an earlier
interview with a Houston TV station. "I can say, without going back to
our people, that is absolute nonsense that they would do something like
that."</TE>
<TE>   Two other Saudi officials traveling with the crown prince did not
immediately return phone messages left Saturday. A White House
spokeswoman said she was aware of the reports but could not immediately
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Pallone, a regional vice president of the National Air Traffic
Controllers Assn., voiced anger over the reports.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think his request should have even been passed on," he said.</TE>

<HD>Fire Chiefs May Be Leery of Top Floors</HD>
<DH>Skyscrapers: Retired New York commissioner says strategy will
change in at least one regard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERSEY CITY, N.J.
</DL>
<LD>Because of the collapse of the World Trade Center towers, fire
chiefs around the world will be less likely to send firefighters to the
upper floors of burning skyscrapers, the former fire commissioner of New
York City said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Otherwise, strategies for battling such fires are unlikely to change
much after the terrorist attacks on the twin towers, said Thomas Van
Essen, who retired in January.</LD>
<LD>   "If there was a fire today in a high-rise in New York City, we would
respond in the way we have for the last 30 years," he said before
addressing a New Jersey City University forum on the trade center
disaster.</LD>
<TE>   "This tragedy was so overwhelming that no one could have predicted
that, within an hour and a half, both these buildings would collapse," he
said. "No one prepares for jet planes crashing into their buildings."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the 343 firefighters killed at the trade center were trying to
evacuate people from upper floors of the twin 110-story skyscrapers.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have something of this enormity, if the [Sears] tower in
Chicago got hit by an enormous jet plane, the chiefs handling the fire
will be very wary about sending people up to such high floors," Von Essen
said.</TE>
<TE>   The trade center attack also highlighted the need for better radio
communication for firefighters, Von Essen said. He noted that many of the
firefighters who died in the collapse never heard the order to get out.</TE>
<TE>   He added that Sept. 11 also demonstrated the importance of having more
than one water source for sprinkler systems. The jetliners that crashed
into the twin towers sliced through the vertical pipes that were the sole
source of water for sprinkler systems.</TE>

<HD>Fla. Lacks Shelters for Major Hurricane, Study Shows</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>If a major hurricane hits Florida, most of the state's counties
won't have enough shelter space in wind-resistant public buildings to
handle the number of people who seek it, a study says.</LD>
<LD>   Sixty of the state's 67 counties have shortages of space in shelters
built to withstand Category 4 and 5 hurricanes, which have winds of more
than 130 mph, according to a study by the state's Division of Emergency
Management.</LD>
<LD>   In some of the state's most heavily populated counties, more than
100,000 people might have to hole up in a building not designed to
withstand the storm or leave the area to find shelter.</LD>
<TE>   Many local emergency officials say the state dramatically overstates
how many shelter spaces are needed. Even so, many also acknowledge they
don't have enough shelters.</TE>
<TE>   "We know if it's a bad Category 4 or Category 5 coming in, we're
toast," said John Wilson, Lee County's emergency management director.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1900, Florida has been hit by seven hurricanes that were
Category 4 or 5. There has been just one in the last 40 years, Hurricane
Andrew, which had sustained winds of up to 145 mph when it made landfall
south of Miami in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   According to the state study, South Florida's Broward County has the
most dramatic shelter shortage, with nearly 170,000 fewer spaces than it
will need if a big hurricane hits. Hillsborough, Pinellas and Lee
counties on the Gulf Coast each has a shortage of about 100,000 spaces.</TE>
<TE>   Hillsborough officials say their county is only about 75,000 spaces
short. And officials in Broward's biggest city, Fort Lauderdale, say they
have plenty of space for everyone who would have to evacuate in all but
the biggest storms.</TE>
<TE>   Many local officials say the state overestimates how many people would
actually seek public shelter, a number anywhere from 15% to 50% of
residents in evacuated areas.</TE>
<TE>   County officials point to Hurricane Floyd, a huge storm that
threatened the Atlantic coast in 1999 but never made landfall in Florida.
More than 2 million people evacuated coastal areas, but only 87,000 of
them, less than 5%, stayed in shelters.</TE>
<TE>   Still, state officials say they prefer counties to be overprepared
rather than underprepared.</TE>
<TE>   In Lee County, which includes Fort Myers, Wilson still comes up 38,000
spaces short of what he thinks he would need, even counting some
buildings that can't stand up to the strongest storms.</TE>
<TE>   "Those people are probably going to have to go find shelter somewhere
else, either in a hotel or motel, which we have very few of inland, find
it at a friend's or relative's, or they're going to have to leave the
area," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The story is worse just north in Charlotte County, which the state
estimates needs shelter space for 28,174 people. The county has no
hurricane shelters.</TE>
<TE>   The plan for any major hurricane, according to Charlotte emergency
director Wayne Sallade: "We've got to move people out."</TE>
<TE>   But in many of Florida's fast-growing coastal communities, fleeing is
just as problematic as not having a place to stay. Evacuees clog the
roads, creating the danger that people will be trapped in their vehicles
when the hurricane hits.</TE>
<TE>   Trescott said people won't leave that far ahead of a storm. "This is
why shelter is important," he said.</TE>

<HD>Bush Owes Presidency to NRA, NRA Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RENO
</DL>
<LD>At their convention here Saturday, National Rifle Assn. leaders
took credit for President Bush's election, saying they're taking aim next
at unseating gun control advocates in Congress and defeating campaign
finance reform in court.</LD>
<LD>   "You are why Al Gore isn't in the White House," NRA Executive Vice
President Wayne LaPierre told more than 4,500 delegates at the NRA's
131st annual meeting.</LD>
<LD>   "No other group could have done what we did collectively in 2000, and
now it's time to finish the job," NRA lobbyist James Jay Baker said. "The
Senate is the hole in our armor. . . . The Senate is our battleground."</LD>
<TE>   Sen. Zell Miller of Georgia, the first Democrat to give the NRA's
keynote address in more than a decade, agreed that Gore's stands on gun
rights cost him key states, including Arkansas, West Virginia and Gore's
home state of Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   "I recall the surprise of national Democratic leaders at losing those
states in the presidential election," Miller, a longtime NRA member, said
in remarks prepared for Saturday night's banquet.</TE>
<TE>   "All their expert pollsters said voters favored gun control. . . .
Well, I stand with heartfelt conviction over a political wind gauge any
day."</TE>
<TE>   NRA President Charlton Heston narrated an eight-minute videotape about
Ronald Reagan--who in 1983 became the first sitting president to address
an NRA convention--before he told the cheering crowd he would grant their
wish to stay on for an unprecedented fifth term as their leader.</TE>
<TE>   "After all we did in the 2000 elections, I think we deserve a personal
visit from President Bush next year, don't you?" Heston said. The
78-year-old actor then held up an 1874 rifle and reprised a signature
line: "From my cold dead hands."</TE>
<TE>   The crown booed the mention of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), lead
sponsor of the campaign finance reforms that the NRA is challenging.</TE>
<TE>   LaPierre said the group "must grow larger and tougher" to fend off
attempts to implement waiting periods on gun purchases at gun shows, to
protect gun manufacturers from lawsuits and to defend 1st Amendment
freedom of speech in the form of campaign advertising.</TE>
<TE>   LaPierre said those who would restrict gun rights are engaged in
"political terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a far greater threat to freedom than any foreign force," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders also took shots at anti-gun groups they say operate under the
banner of "gun safety."</TE>
<TE>   "We invented gun safety," said Craig Sandler, NRA director of general
operations. "What does the Violence Policy Center know or do about gun
safety? . . . What does the Million Mom March know or do about gun
safety?"</TE>

<HD>Clinton Supports Powell on Approach to Mideast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>McALLEN, Texas
</DL>
<LD>Former President Clinton urged support for Secretary of State Colin
L. Powell's peacekeeping efforts in the Middle East during an appearance
Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   "I think some of the negative publicity about Colin Powell's trip has
been wrong," Clinton told reporters at a fund-raiser for Latino college
students.</LD>
<LD>   "No matter how long they fight or how many people die, in the end if
there's going to be peace there has to be security and normal relations
with neighbors," Clinton said. "There has to be justice and economic
opportunities for the Palestinians."</LD>
<TE>   Powell's recent trip to the Mideast did little to stop the violence.
The State Department has announced that Powell will hold talks next week,
perhaps in Washington, with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Russian
Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov and top officials of the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush recently criticized Clinton, saying his failed 2000
Mideast summit resulted in a "significant intifada."</TE>

<HD>A Little Digging Into Prehistory Really Pays Off</HD>
<DH>Books: Jean M. Auel wanted to write of Neanderthals but knew
nothing about them. Her research resulted in the 'Earth's Children'
series; latest one comes out Tuesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GILLIAN FLACCUS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.
</DL>
<LD>Twenty-five years ago, Jean M. Auel sat down to write the first
threads of an epic prehistoric tale and realized she didn't know anything
about her subject.</LD>
<LD>   She wanted one of her main characters, a young girl, to help a
crippled Neanderthal man get a drink of water. The problem was, Auel
didn't know if Neanderthals had cups--and if they did, how they used
them.</LD>
<LD>   "How do you get a drink of water? I mean, did she have to take him to
the water where he lay down on his belly and lapped it up like an animal
or something?" Auel asked.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't know what I was writing about. I didn't know who these
people really were. I didn't know what they looked like, I didn't know
what they wore and I didn't know where they lived."</TE>
<TE>   A lot has changed since then.</TE>
<TE>'The Clan of the Cave Bear' Begins Series</TE>
<TE>   Auel's first fumbling attempts to write a short story "about a girl
living with people who were truly different" has evolved into the
best-selling "Earth's Children" series. The volumes are an intricately
researched tale set 35,000 years ago, when many people believe early
human and Neanderthal societies overlapped.</TE>
<TE>   The series began with the best-selling "The Clan of the Cave Bear,"
which tells the story of a 5-year-old abandoned girl taken in by a group
of Neanderthals. The fifth book, "The Shelters of Stone," goes on sale
Tuesday with an international release of 2 million copies.</TE>
<TE>   "I sincerely do not know what I'm doing right," the author said. "I'm
writing the story that I always wanted to read. It's important to do the
detail of it, because that's how you make the story come alive."</TE>
<TE>   Developing that detail has been a tremendous challenge--and joy--for
Auel, 66.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever possible, she draws on fact, using details from tools,
skeletons and cave paintings found at prehistoric archeological
excavations around the world. But artifacts of stone and bone don't
reveal the intricacies of daily Cro-Magnon life in the harsh climate of
the last Ice Age. How did people interact? How did they worship? What did
they wear?</TE>
<TE>   Auel had to piece together those details, melding hints from the past
with archeological theories and her imagination.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hints, it's suggestions, but that's enough for me to write
about," she said. "There are pieces missing and I have to color them in.
I'm not going to put palm trees on top of a mountain. On the other hand,
so long as it is within the constraints, I can color that any way I
want."</TE>
<TE>Nearly 35 Million Copies Sold</TE>
<TE>   Auel's coloring has paid off handsomely. Her first four books,
beginning with "The Clan of the Cave Bear" in 1980, have sold nearly 35
million copies.</TE>
<TE>   Fans already are ensuring that "The Shelters of Stone" will be just as
popular. On Monday, it was the No. 3 book on Amazon.com. One advance copy
sold for $625 at a recent high school charity auction.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the following that she has now is incredible," said Barbara
Marks of Crown, Auel's publisher. "There's something about the
characters, and it's not only stepping into a different world. These
characters are just so compelling."</TE>
<TE>   Auel's success is perhaps most surprising to the author herself, who
recently discussed her life and work during an interview at a hotel in
Portland, where she lives. She sipped coffee as she talked, her face
adorned with glasses and framed by her reddish-brown hair.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Chicago, Auel married her husband, Ray, just after high
school. They moved to Roswell, N.M., and she had five children by the
time she was 25. She struggled to rear a family, work and go to night
school, first in math and physics, then for an MBA at Portland State
University.</TE>
<TE>   Until her first novel, which she completed when she was in her
mid-40s, Auel's only published work was "So You Want to Build a Circuit
Board," an instruction manual she wrote while building circuit boards at
Tektronix, an electronic testing equipment manufacturer. She also wrote
poetry in her spare time, but didn't publish it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was never a goal, never a dream for me to be a writer," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Shelters of Stone," Auel follows Ayla as she adjusts to living
in a human community after years with the adoptive Neanderthals and being
on her own. Ayla and her human mate, Jondalar, return to his home in what
is now southwestern France, where Ayla struggles to fit in.</TE>
<TE>   The tale unfolds in a 15-mile stretch of the Perigord region, from
modern-day Montignac to Les Eyzies, where dozens of caves pockmark a
fertile valley. Archeological evidence shows that prehistoric people
lived in the shelters of that region--some measuring 10,000 square
feet--around the same time during the last Ice Age.</TE>
<TE>   Jondalar, who is 6 feet 6, is based on a skeleton of a young male that
was discovered in a nearby cave. He measured 6 feet 5 3/4.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as I read about him . . . I said, that's got to be Ayla's
man," Auel said. "I took a quarter-inch of literary license because it's
easier to write 6-foot-6 than 6-foot-5 3/4."</TE>
<TE>   In the book, Ayla is the first human to domesticate wild animals, an
ability that is mystical to other humans she meets. Her talent delays her
acceptance into Jondalar's community because of fear and suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   Auel used an archeological clue--a carved horse's head bearing strange
markings along the jaw and nose--to develop the idea of domesticating
animals.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people say [the carved lines] are stylized muscle structure, but
they sure look like a bridle to me," Auel said. "We've got this thing
going around the nose, we've got a line going up the horse's head--that's
a bridle. On one of them you can actually see the rope marks carved in."</TE>
<TE>   Not constrained by the need for scientific rigor, Auel gave Ayla two
tamed horses and a domesticated wolf that comes at a whistle, baby-sits
small children and knows its name.</TE>
<TE>   Other elements of early life--such as religious and social
beliefs--were harder to come by. In some cases, Auel looked to
contemporary primitive societies, particularly for inspiration for what
Cro-Magnon burial rituals might have been like. In other cases, she was
forced to examine archeological records for scant clues.</TE>
<TE>   Auel emphasizes equality between the sexes in "The Shelters of Stone,"
often making women powerful spiritual leaders, healers and community
leaders. Women participate in almost every daily activity, from hunting
to cooking to cave-painting.</TE>
<TE>   The author drew on a study showing that scientists have found an equal
number of burial sites for Cro-Magnon women and men, with a slight
preponderance for women.</TE>
<TE>   It's shaky evidence, but it's enough for Auel to go on.</TE>
<TE>   "Scientists can say, 'Well, Dr. So-and-So thinks this and Dr.
So-and-So thinks that,' but if you're writing fiction, characters either
do or they don't," she said. "You have to make a choice--you can't have
it all."</TE>
<TE>   Auel worked hard to make her characters and their daily lives seem
real. She learned to shape flint tools, weave baskets and mats, tan hides
and prepare medicine from wild plants at the Malheur Field Station in the
high-desert steppe of central Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   She also participated in a weeklong dig at Laugerie Haute--the
so-called Ninth Cave in the latest novel. (She will travel to
southwestern France for the novel's release.)</TE>
<TE>   "I have to live the lives of my characters; I have to make them move
in this world," she said. "You had to be darned intelligent to survive in
those days. You had to be intelligent, you had to figure things out, you
had to know."</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, Auel says, archeologists have reacted favorably to
her books, even if they don't agree with every idea.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Kennett, an archeology professor at the University of Oregon,
said "The Clan of the Cave Bear" was required reading when he was a
graduate student. The goal was to help students understand the importance
of telling a story based on research, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, it's sort of fanciful. But in certain cases, she captures
aspects of what the Pleistocene might have been like," Kennett said. "As
long as it's grounded in some kind of scientific reality, that's fine."</TE>
<TE>   Auel said some archeologists have asked her to write about their
excavation sites after reading her books, because even the scientists
enjoy thinking about the "what ifs" of prehistory.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that whole period is so much fun," she said. "I wanted to
show that early humans were not stupid . . . that they were not just
savage, but that they had some sophistication."</TE>

<HD>If All Else Fails, the Air Force Rescue Flight Unit Takes Over</HD>
<DH>Emergencies: Attached to the service's survival school, the group
trains to find lost hunters or skiers after civilian efforts are
exhausted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN K. WILEY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SPOKANE, Wash.
</DL>
<LD>Cold, wet and shivering, Amanda Duclos and Joann Ruddach huddled in
the dark on Mt. Spokane, hours after they had ridden their snowboards out
of bounds from a ski area.</LD>
<LD>   The Ski Patrol, their families and others spent hours searching
unsuccessfully for the 14-year-olds as night fell and temperatures
dropped below freezing.</LD>
<LD>   It was about 12:20 a.m. when the girls heard the distinctive whomp,
whomp, whomp of an Air Force UH-1N Huey helicopter of the 36th Rescue
Flight from Spokane's Fairchild Air Force Base.</LD>
<TE>   A hundred feet above the trees, Maj. Randy Kelly and three crew
members peered into the darkness through night-vision goggles. The Huey's
sophisticated Forward-Looking Infrared Radar, which scans for sources of
heat, was not working properly, so it was strictly a visual search.</TE>
<TE>   As Kelly banked to make a right turn to top a ravine, he saw movement
out of the corner of his eye at the edge of a small clearing.</TE>
<TE>   It was Amanda and Joann, screaming, jumping and waving their arms.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes, Kelly set the helicopter down in the clearing--not
much wider than its 50-foot-diameter rotor blades--and flight medic
Master Sgt. Patrick Kern was wading through waist-deep snow to reach the
girls. They had become the 584th and 585th "saves" of the rescue unit
since its founding at Fairchild in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   The unit, which is attached to the Air Force Survival School, trains
for such mountain operations as part of its civilian search and rescue
mission in an area from the Cascades in Washington to the Rockies in
Montana.</TE>
<TE>   The helicopters are used specifically for finding lost hunters or
skiers, and are not the type the military uses to extricate soldiers from
combat situations, Kelly said.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1956, when the National Search and Rescue Plan was published,
military people and equipment have been available to assist local and
state agencies in life-or-death emergencies. Each mission is authorized
by the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center at Langley Air Force Base in
Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the center answered 7,333 calls for assistance and
authorized 2,821 missions in the contiguous 48 states, spokesman Capt.
John Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   The center has cooperative agreements that the military will respond
only after state and local authorities have exhausted all their
resources, Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force search and rescue crews have been involved in notable
missions in past years, including two in 1999: the search for John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s downed airplane off Martha's Vineyard and tracking the
private jet flying on autopilot in which golfer Payne Stewart died.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, military aircraft participated in mercy flights,
carrying human blood and organs to hospitals in New York City and
Washington when civilian flights were grounded after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force helicopters and aircraft also are used for medical
evacuations when no commercial transportation is available, a person's
life is in jeopardy, and time is critical.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force helicopters are used extensively in rescues of civilians,
mostly skiers, hikers and hunters who get lost in the mountains, but also
searches for downed pilots or Alzheimer's patients and children who
wander away from home.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Amanda and Joann, searchers worked about seven hours
before the Fairchild crews arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Although the girls had a cellular telephone, searchers were unable to
determine their location before the batteries failed, Joann's mother,
Karla Ruddach said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have unique equipment that no one else has," flight commander Lt.
Col. J. Matthew Lyons said. The four helicopters are equipped with
infrared radar, called FLIR, and 250-foot hoists.</TE>
<TE>   Their primary purpose is to support operations of the Air Force
Survival School here, which trains Air Force flight crews in techniques
for surviving and evading capture after their planes are downed in remote
or hostile areas.</TE>
<TE>   "The training missions we fly for the Survival School have a direct
application to civilian uses," Lyons said.</TE>
<TE>   The 14-year-olds visited the flight's headquarters April 11 to thank
Kelly and his crew for saving their lives the previous weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "This is why we fly helicopters," Kern said.</TE>
<TE>   When they were rescued, the girls' body temperatures had dropped to 95
degrees, but they were able to go home after being warmed and checked at
the Mt. Spokane Ski Patrol. They took all the fuss in stride.</TE>
<TE>   "We really didn't think we'd be there that long," Amanda said. "We
really didn't think they'd call out the Air Force."</TE>

<HD>In Hawaii, Black Market Branches Out to Koa Tree</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HILO, Hawaii
</DL>
<LD>The rising value of koa wood--used for everything from Hawaiian
canoes to hand-crafted ukuleles--has led to increasing thefts and a black
market for the traditional hardwood, authorities say.</LD>
<LD>   Although no one knows the scope of illegal activity, foresters and
state conservation enforcement officials point to recent busts that show
an increase in thievery statewide.</LD>
<LD>   A koa tree theft ring was busted on Kauai last year, and a Big Island
grand jury issued indictments in a separate case this year.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said there also have been reports of other recent thefts
on Oahu, while state conservation enforcement officers say they are
investigating a large case on the Big Island.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're seeing is just the tip of the iceberg," said John Holley,
a Big Island state conservation enforcement officer.</TE>
<TE>   The koa tree, a native species that grows only in Hawaii, is not
considered an endangered, but harvesting is scarce and its value has
never been greater.</TE>
<TE>   A mature tree can turn out tens of thousands of dollars worth of
finished koa products.</TE>
<TE>   "It's practically worth its weight in gold," said Andrea Gill,
executive director of the Hawaii Forest Industry Assn.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the wood's rising value is its growing scarcity.</TE>
<TE>   The natural range for the trees has diminished over the years because
of logging and land-clearing for agricultural production and cattle
grazing.</TE>
<TE>   The resource continues to decline under pressure from grazing, an
influx of alien plant species and harvesting.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting mined like it's a mineral," state forester Michael
Constantinides said.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for koa far exceeds the supply, which generally is available
only on private land, mostly from pastures that contain the remnants of
koa forests.</TE>
<TE>   Harvesting on state lands is generally limited to a few areas where
those holding permits are allowed to take only trees that have fallen on
their own.</TE>
<TE>   The shrinking supply has caused prices to shoot up seven to 10 times
in the last 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Koa is like a god," said Mel Pauole, a professional woodworker from
Kailua-Kona. "It plays such a big role in the culture. So many people
here look upon it as a really special wood."</TE>
<TE>   Some say the problem is likely to continue because few eyes are
watching over Hawaii's vast koa forests.</TE>
<TE>   On the Big Island, where most of the state's koa grows, there are
about 20 officers responsible for as much as 1 million acres of state
Department of Land and Natural Resources territory, plus the ocean
extending 12 miles offshore.</TE>
<TE>   In the Kau District, a single officer oversees an area the size of
Oahu.</TE>
<TE>   The state Division of Conservation and Enforcement has increased its
patrol of prime koa stands and lobbied for legislation that would make it
illegal to transport forest products without records detailing where they
were obtained.</TE>
<TE>   But protecting the koa forests remains a daunting task.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't be everywhere," said Lenny Terlep Sr., the forestry
division's Hilo branch chief. "We're being used for security at the
ports, as escorts in the courts. . . . We rely heavily on tips and good,
solid information."</TE>

<HD>Northwest Roiling on the River Over Dredging Plans</HD>
<DH>Shipping: Army Corp of Engineers wants to deepen the Columbia 3
feet to accommodate larger vessels. Opponents say benefits don't offset
risks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHERINE PFLEGER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>If the Army Corps of Engineers has its way, the Columbia River's
shipping channel will be three feet deeper--a dredging endeavor that in
50 years would move about as much rock and sand as was taken to dig the
Panama Canal.</LD>
<LD>   The corps' $188-million plan is based on a decade of study and backed
by shipping, agricultural and labor interests. Northwest politicians
argue that the project is necessary to keep Portland, Ore., and five of
its smaller neighbors viable shipping ports.</LD>
<LD>   Shipping vessels are getting bigger, supporters say, and the river
needs to be able to accommodate larger loads.</LD>
<TE>   "It is not so much a question of if it should be done, but when it
should be done," said Jonathan Schlueter, executive vice president of the
Pacific Northwest Grain and Feed Assn. "We are competitors in a global
market."</TE>
<TE>   But critics--Indian tribes, environmentalists and fishing communities
at the mouth of the river--worry that the environmental risks,
particularly to endangered salmon, are being underestimated to justify
the project.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is that the fish are not happy in their spawning areas and
migration corridors," said Nina Bell, executive director of Northwest
Environmental Advocates. "What we should be talking about is fixing that,
not making it worse."</TE>
<TE>   As designed, the corps' plan would deepen just more than 100 miles of
shipping channel from the river's mouth to Portland, taking its current
40-foot depth to 43 feet.</TE>
<TE>   The deepening would take just a couple of years to complete. But
maintenance dredging to keep the deeper channel would continue for
decades. The dredged material would be disposed of on land, at sea, in
the river and near shorelines to reduce erosion and create shallow marsh
habitat.</TE>
<TE>   All told, the channel deepening project could move an estimated 200
million cubic yards of rock, sand and mud over the next half a century.
By comparison, building the Panama Canal involved removing 211 million
cubic yards of material.</TE>
<TE>   The corps estimates the project would yield about $2 for every dollar
spent, providing $34.4 million in annual transportation savings for the
next 50 years. But its findings have been questioned, and earlier this
year the corps separately began to review and update its calculations.</TE>
<TE>   Two federal agencies--the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the
National Marine Fisheries Service--also are expected to issue reports
soon about how the dredging would affect endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   The corps insists it can help business interests and improve the
habitat.</TE>
<TE>   The plan includes creating shallow marshes with dredged sand and rock.
The agency promises to have experts monitoring changes to ensure that
restoration projects are helping 23 threatened and endangered species.
The project could be stopped or altered as needed, project manager Laura
Hicks said.</TE>
<TE>   But local tribes say one need look no further than the river to show
that corps' environmental improvements sometimes just create more
problems. They cite Rice Island, created from dredging spoils, a
byproduct of work done now to keep the river at its current depth. It has
become a wonderful perch for Caspian terns to hunt salmon, further
thinning the endangered fish population.</TE>
<TE>   "The corps is talking about creating more habitat? Like the habitat
they created with the maintenance dredging?" asked Bob Heinith of the
Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The concerns about possible environmental impact hit American Indians,
crabbers and fisherman in the pocketbook. Some say the deeper channel
will bring more Pacific saltwater farther up the river, harming the
delicate estuary habitat where juvenile fish mature.</TE>
<TE>   Others worry that bigger ships mean bigger wakes, and more fish could
get stranded in shallow pools near the shore. They say crabs at the mouth
of the river would be smothered by dredged material. Still others
complain that plans to do the dredging year-round wouldn't give the fish
a chance to migrate safely.</TE>
<TE>   An investigation by the Oregonian in Portland of the corps' economic
justification for the project also raises questions. The newspaper
concluded that the corps overstated benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than meeting the minimum $1 in economic gain for every $1 in
cost, as corps policy requires, the newspaper concluded that the deeper
channel would yield only 88 cents for each dollar spent--findings the
corps disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Agency spokesman Matt Rabe said the corps has requested the
newspaper's data. The Oregonian said it used agency numbers.</TE>
<TE>   The corps, ports favoring the project and their supporting business
interests argue vehemently that ships carrying grain and containers on
the Columbia are getting larger and will continue to do so.</TE>
<TE>   If the river can't accommodate heavier vessels that sit deeper in the
river, some worry that business will go to deeper ports such as
Washington's Seattle or Tacoma.</TE>
<TE>   David Hunt, executive director of the Columbia River Channel
Coalition--which represents unions, agricultural groups, ports and other
dredging advocates--said the increased depth will save some container
shippers 20% in costs and grain shippers 10%.</TE>
<TE>   The savings are particularly important for grain exporters, he said,
because the United States competes in an international market with ports
in Australia and South America.</TE>
<TE>   He said the range of supporters--from Oregon's Democratic Gov. John
Kitzhaber to former Republican Sen. Slade Gorton of Washington--prove
opponents are "environmental extremists" outside the political
mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   Every member of the Oregon and Washington congressional delegations in
1999 voted to authorize the project. But the federal share of the
funding--$133 million--hasn't been approved. Oregon and Washington would
contribute $27.7 million each.</TE>
