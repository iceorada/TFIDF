<HD>Wisdom From a Beard? Patience, Patience</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Al Martinez</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I've noticed that ever since I began growing a beard, things seem
different.</LD>
<LD>   My wife no longer criticizes me for watching "Buffy the Vampire
Slayer," the dog doesn't growl at me when I walk in the door, and
friends ask my opinions on subjects ranging from Euclidean geometry
to Martha Stewart's new image.</LD>
<LD>   There is an assumption of wisdom attached to my beard, and those
who once dismissed me as a buffoon are now pleased to invite me to
participate in discussions on the impact of facial hair on the
national economy.</LD>
<TE>   I have accepted the new position of wisdom, even though I don't
know a lot about very much. I have learned to simply reply,
"Patience, patience," and it is accepted not only as wise but
extraordinarily quotable.</TE>
<TE>   The other day I heard a friend whisper to his wife that I had
said, "Patience, patience," and she almost cried. Someday the phrase
will be right up there with "I am not a crook" and "I did not have
sex with that woman."</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks ago I was invited to a dinner and sat next to Paul
Boyer, an enzyme specialist who won a Nobel Prize in chemistry five
years ago. While I wisely avoided any subject involving science, I
was able to converse with him without appearing to be a babbling
fool. I even managed not to spill any red wine on my white linen
jacket. I'm sure it was the power of the beard.</TE>
<TE>   When we got home and Cinelli asked when was I going to stop
drinking more than anyone else at the table, I raised my hand in the
manner of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and replied in hushed tones,
"Patience, patience."</TE>
<TE>   I began growing the beard about two months ago, not because I
wanted a beard but because I didn't want to shave. I realized during
that period of growth how easy it was to just let my chin hair have
its way. It is one of the few achievements in life that doesn't
require money and doesn't cause dry mouth.</TE>
<TE>   Some might recall that in a previous column, I mentioned Kai
Cofer, an actor whose name I found in a Web site on beards. It was
his goal, according to the Internet page, to grow the longest beard
ever. I, of course, made fun of his minimalist ambition, and
suggested that it was at least something for him to think about
during long periods between acting jobs.</TE>
<TE>   To my surprise, he called and graciously thanked me for mentioning
his name, but assured me he was working all the time because of the
beard. That intrigued me enough to meet with him and to enjoy a
pleasant lunch discussing facial hair.</TE>
<TE>   Cofer is a good-natured man of 40 with a 16-inch beard. Contrary
to my suggestion, he works regularly on History Channel presentations
with biblical themes, and has had parts in television series such as
"Malcolm in the Middle," "Even Stevens" and "Lizzie McGuire." While
unfamiliar with Lizzie, I'm sure she's a sweetheart.</TE>
<TE>   What Cofer discovered was that the beard set him apart from other
actors and got him roles while his colleagues waited tables. Whenever
he grew the beard, he worked. When he shaved it off, times were lean.
So the beard stays in a "partial-full state," which is somewhere
between those worn by Geoffrey Chaucer and Vlad the Impaler.</TE>
<TE>   He laughed when I asked about growing the longest beard on record,
then said he'd given up that ambition long ago. Someone named Hans
Langseth holds the record by growing a beard 17 feet, 6 inches long.
Poor Hans is dead, but his beard lives on at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   I guess it was the conversation with Cofer that convinced me I
should keep the beard for the time being. While I don't intend trying
out for a biblical role on the History Channel, I could end up among
the wise men on "Face the Nation."</TE>
<TE>   It occurred to me, as I researched the beard, how many famous
people have worn them throughout history, including such luminaries
as Santa Claus, Jesus Christ and Buffalo Bill. Egypt's Queen
Hatshepsut wore a fake beard, believing it would enhance her ability
to rule an empire. Al Gore apparently had the same idea. In some
depictions, God also has a beard.</TE>
<TE>   A book by Allan Peterkin called "One Thousand Beards" contains
more information about facial hair than anyone really needs to know.
But if you're a beard person, it's a bible. Peterkin is also the
author of "The Bald-Headed Hermit &amp; the Artichoke: An Erotic
Thesaurus." I don't even want to know what that's about.</TE>
<TE>   I did learn from him, however, how many different types of beards
exist, ranging from the Poet's Beard, worn by such members of the
cognoscenti as Bob Denver, star of "Gilligan's Island," and the
Cathedral Beard, featured on Leonardo da Vinci, who, while he had no
role on "Gilligan's Island," did manage to achieve in other fields.</TE>
<TE>   As my own beard grew, a light of sorts shone down, endowing me
with the wisdom I now possess, a spirituality in tune with the
universe. Feel free, therefore, to seek my advice on any subject. I
will stroke my beard, nod my head, as wise men are inclined to do,
and reply, "Patience, patience." Can you think of anything better?</TE>

<HD>With Teens and Internet Sex, Curiosity Can Become
Compulsion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Initially, the UC San Diego freshman visited online sex sites because
he had become so anxious during two dates with women that he couldn't
speak. For him, looking at pornographic photos on the Web was a
relief from the pressure of interacting with real women. But the
freshman quickly progressed to watching pornographic videos online
and then to visiting interactive sites for online sex.</LD>
<LD>   Eventually, his cyber sex encounters became so compulsive and
disruptive that his grades dropped and his father began receiving
exorbitant credit card bills for the services.</LD>
<LD>   The freshman's story is told in "The Sex Lives of Teenagers"
(Plume, 2001), written by Dr. Lynn Ponton, a professor of psychiatry
at UC San Francisco. "It was so easy," the freshman, whose name was
kept confidential, says in the book explaining his attraction to sex
sites. "I was in control. I knew what was going to happen next. I
even felt like I was getting experience. I'm not sure when it started
to change, but it was like it started running my life."</LD>
<TE>   Less than 3% of adolescents are "addicted" to cyber sex, said
Ponton, but she and other mental health professionals say that the
cases are troubling for many reasons. What happened to the freshman,
whose father introduced him to pornographic videos as an adolescent
in a misguided attempt to educate him about sex, is what is happening
to other young men who are shy, insecure and have difficulty relating
to a prospective romantic partner.</TE>
<TE>   "This boy had started using these sites in high school and then
went to college where a lot of boys become addicted to online sex
because they are lonely," said Ponton, who usually is contacted by
parents after they get the credit card bills, up to $600 for online
sex services. "These boys are low man on the totem pole and they
don't know how to ask a girl out on a date, so they go to these
[interactive sites] for sex. What concerns me is I have already seen
a lot of boys who can't stop using Internet sex sites and they don't
have the ability to interact with a normal girl," Ponton said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the fusion of sexuality and the Internet has created new
and uncharted influences upon the development of adolescents and
young adults.</TE>
<TE>   In cyberspace, adolescents and teenagers flirt, talk dirty, send
each other photos and have "cyber sex" with people they might never
encounter face to face. In roughly 80% of pornographic sites, said
Ponton, women are featured in an abusive way, in a state of
degradation or as a victim of violence, thereby uniting sex and
violence.</TE>
<TE>   When those sex sites become a part of a boy's sexual response
trigger (which means sexual arousal cannot be reached without them),
breaking the sexual compulsion becomes particularly difficult, Ponton
said.</TE>
<TE>   But the intersection of sex and the Internet isn't all bad. "The
Internet has become a place where teenagers can try flirting with
each other without much risk," said Ponton, who called it practicing
relationships. The problem for girls, though, is they sometimes
present themselves online as one or two years older than they are and
they are more vulnerable to falling in love with a person about whom
they have little real information. Aside from the issue of sex
offenders trying to meet young girls or boys, some psychologists
worry that teenagers who create online relationships are missing out
on developing critical social skills.</TE>
<TE>   "They are bypassing early social skills and jumping into these
charged interactions that are sexually explicit or situations in
which there is aggressive flirting," said Chris Kraft, a psychologist
at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Marital and Sexual Health,
Sexual Behaviors Consultation Unit. "Adolescents are not always ready
to deal with such things. Being exposed to such explicit information
can speed up the sexuality of adolescents who, we know, are sexually
active earlier and earlier." The average age at which teenagers
become sexually active in the U.S. is 16, Kraft said.</TE>
<TE>   About 70% of 15- to 17-year-olds reported they had accidentally
come across pornography on the Web, with 35% of girls and 6% of boys
saying they were upset by the experience, according to the Kaiser
survey. About 57% of 15- to 24-year-olds believed being exposed to
online pornography could have a serious impact on those younger than
18; 41% said it's "no big deal." No one really knows how many
teenagers are intentionally visiting the sites, but for some the
discovery is more than "no big deal."</TE>
<TE>   "I actually had a boy who was 16 and he would be looking at
pornography with his 12-year-old sister and he would turn to his
sister and say, 'Let's try this,'" said Kraft, who added that over
the last couple of years he has seen more adolescent boys dealing
with compulsions for online sex.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good example of how this graphic material is
overwhelming some adolescents when it comes to sexuality. Adolescent
males are at the height of their sexual development and the amount of
masturbation is high during this period, which is normal. But it's a
highly vulnerable period to be aroused by this graphic material."</TE>
<TE>   Potentially, Kraft said, adolescence is a period when a fetish
could develop. Exactly how fetishes develop is still a matter of
debate, but one prevailing theory is that sometime in early childhood
or early adolescence, just as sexual maturation is occurring, a child
will become aroused by an idea, object or image. If the arousal is
intense enough, the theory goes, the child will work to repeat the
experience and, at some point, the trigger object or idea becomes
necessary for sexual arousal.</TE>
<TE>   "This wouldn't be a problem but everything that is a fetish that
you can imagine is available on the Internet now," Kraft said.
"Seeing a lot of this imagery ... normalizes it for some adolescents.
Not all adolescents will respond the same way. But some don't
necessarily know that they are learning unhealthy sexuality. The
Internet can give a skewed impression."</TE>
<TE>   What's a parent to do? Is a V-chip the answer? Teenagers are so
computer savvy, Ponton said, that many know how to hack through a
V-chip, plus computers are widely available outside the home. One of
the best things parents can do, Ponton and Kraft agreed, is talk
openly about sexuality and encourage children to get information from
them rather than from the Web.</TE>
<TE>   More important, parents should become computer literate
themselves, check out various sites, supervise online activity as
much as possible, counsel teens not to give out their address and
intervene if an "online friend" appears to be an older person posing
as a younger person. Kraft advises parents to remove computers from
bedrooms and place them in a central room.</TE>
<TE>   Sexual development and risk-taking are a normal part of
adolescence, Ponton said, and unfortunately parents cannot control
either one.</TE>
<TE>   "Our best tool is to help our kids learn to assess risks and to
have real friends as well as online friends."</TE>

<LD>BAD BLOOD</LD>
<LD>   A Memoir</LD>
<LD>   By Lorna Sage</LD>
<TE>   William Morrow</TE>
<TE>   288 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   An influential literary critic, professor at the University of
East Anglia and biographer of novelist Angela Carter, Lorna Sage had
an active career cut short by an untimely demise. The 57-year-old
Sage died of emphysema and related infections in January 2001. But
she did live long enough to complete the book that won her the 2000
Whitbread Biography Award: "Bad Blood," a scintillating memoir of
three generations.</TE>
<TE>   Few otherwise lamentable situations are richer in comic potential
than a truly rotten marriage--to outsiders, anyway, if not to the
participants.</TE>
<TE>   The first section of the book stars Sage's maternal grandparents,
an Anglican vicar and his wife, who had ceased talking to each other
before their granddaughter was born. So fierce had been their fights
that their daughter (Lorna's mother) lost her front teeth trying to
break up one of their battles, while the vicar bore a scar left by
his wife and her trusty carving knife.</TE>
<TE>   Born during World War II, little Lorna started life in an odd
household. Her father was away fighting the war, her shy,
hard-working mother was kept busy around the house, while her
grandmother withdrew to her room in a permanent fit of pique,
refusing to do housework, socialize with parishioners or perform any
of the functions usually associated with the role of a vicar's wife.
She hated her husband, her marriage and the tiny rural village where
he'd been sent to serve as vicar: "She'd shake a trembling fist at
the people going past the vicarage to church each Sunday, although
they probably couldn't see her from behind the bars and dirty glass."
Lorna became her grandfather's shadow, following him around the
house, church and village, especially the pubs where he pursued one
of his favorite occupations: drinking.</TE>
<TE>   Relegated by his superiors to a poor, remote, backward country
parish in northern Wales, this highly literate, histrionic man had a
flair for dramatic pulpit oratory, a passion for amateur theatricals
and a history of womanizing. He seemed to extract a bitter, ironic
pleasure from his own misery. His wife referred to him as "The Old
Devil," but to little Lorna, he was something else entirely. "Back
then," she recalls, "I thought that was what a vicar was: someone
bony and eloquent and smelly (tobacco, candle grease, sour claret),
who talked into space. His disappointments were just part of the act
for me, along with his dog-collar and cassock. I was like a baby
goose imprinted by the first mother-figure it sees--he was my black
marker."</TE>
<TE>   Sage's accounts of her later discovery of her grandfather's
diaries--and of her grandmother's success in blackmailing him--make
for truly enthralling, downright hilarious reading. Equally brilliant
is her acidulous portrait of her grandmother, "soft and slightly
powdery to the touch, as though she'd been dusted all over with icing
sugar like a sponge cake ... she insisted that she couldn't chew or
digest gristly, fibrous meals with meat and vegetables, but must live
on thin bread and butter with the crusts cut off...."</TE>
<TE>   If her grandparents' marriage might have furnished the material
for a Strindberg play, Sage's parents could have posed for a poster
of marital harmony. Moving out of the chaotic vicarage into sparkling
new public housing after the war, they strove to embody the postwar
ideal of the happy, functional, nuclear family: her father, the
responsible family man and up-and-coming entrepreneur; her mother,
the loyal, loving wife.</TE>
<TE>   Young Lorna's take on her parents' "normalcy" was wryly
subversive: "For a husband and wife to get on together, gang up with
each other, seemed strange and unfair." The adolescent Lorna must
have been a difficult customer: obstinate, self-willed, hard to
reach. (She claims that for years she was actually unable to tell
time.) As befits a future literary critic, she had an insatiable
appetite for all kinds of books. Afflicted with insomnia, she would
stay up all night reading and much preferred imaginary worlds to the
one in which she lived. At the same time, she was entranced with the
emerging teenage pop culture, desperately seeking Elvis-like traits
in the boys she met. Her first romance, so to speak, is quite an
unusual one that might well be used to make a case for mandatory sex
education courses.</TE>
<TE>   Written with shrewd insight and enormous verve, Sage's evocative,
enthralling, often hilarious, memoir accomplishes the two goals of
its particular genre, summoning up the general spirit of a time and
place while conveying a keen sense of individual uniqueness.</TE>

<DH>As their popularity surges, fire performers seek
legitimacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUSTIN HAMPTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After 9 on Wednesday nights in downtown L.A., a usually abandoned
parking lot catches fire. Soot-covered toolboxes, fire extinguishers,
fireproof duvetyn blankets and metallic canisters of white gas are
stacked on the asphalt. And a colorful group of characters ranging
from young professionals to street performers and pink-haired ravers
pull their hair back and reveal their identities as pyrophiles,
members of Los Angeles' growing community of fire performers.</LD>
<LD>   This informal practice group, called Fireplay, has been meeting
here for a year and a half, bringing together a crowd of about 50 to
trade information on upcoming performances, teach newcomers, practice
acrobatic moves and dance steps, and occasionally "light up" their
equipment.</LD>
<LD>   Some juggle burning torches. Others might dance with "poi,"
flaming rectangular wicks that hang at intervals along chains or
cables and swing across the body in incandescent streaks. Whatever
the tool or technique, the goal is the same: to channel fire's
paradoxical nature into fun, spiritual fulfillment--and even
rent-paying gigs at raves, dance clubs and in films.</LD>
<TE>   Once underground, pyrophile communities like Fireplay now thrive
in practically every continent and communicate with each other
through international online destinations such as Home of Poi. Dance
clubs and films like "Charlie's Angels" "The Beach" and "Queen of the
Damned" have tapped the chic atavism of the fire phenomenon for
background flavor. A disparate group of acolytes ranging from ravers
and Goths to Renaissance Fair attendees has discovered common ground
in an undertaking at once universal and intensely tribal. And with
the resurgent popularity comes a new desire for legitimacy, as local
pyrophiles seek to adjust laws and public perception to support their
ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   Essentially, a typical performance consists of a provocatively
dressed performer dancing with flaming props--poi, batons or ornate
finger extensions with wicks on the ends--until the fire goes out.
There's no denying that the inherent danger of manipulating fire
accounts for some of its appeal, says James Taylor, author of the
circus sideshow periodical Shocked and Amazed! On and Off the Midway.</TE>
<TE>   "Fire fascinates people, because you're like a rising phoenix out
of it. You're going into what people fear, and you're coming out of
it apparently unscathed, surviving the worst that nature can throw at
you. Fire plays with all of our primal fears at the base. [It's like]
'This is nothing any normal and intelligent human should do, and here
are people playing with it like it's where they live.' It's very hard
to top that as an act."</TE>
<TE>   But invincibility is a hard-won illusion. Most longtime fire
dancers have been burned at least once in their careers, and
fire-breathers can suffer crippling "blowbacks" of the flame into
their face or throat, as well as kidney and liver failures brought
about by ingesting fuel.</TE>
<TE>   E.J. "Tedward" LeCouteur, an L.A. fire aficionado, has developed a
cottage industry within this growing community by selling poi chains,
Kevlar wicks and other fire tools and toys through his online company
Bearclaw Manufacturing (www.bearclawmfg.com). All are designed to be
safer than those equipment performers make themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Like many who now work with fire, LeCouteur first made contact
with serious fire performance at the annual Burning Man Arts Festival
in northwestern Nevada. He speaks fondly of a moment in the festival
when he displayed his 10-year experience as a kendo instructor with a
pair of flaming swords for an awe-struck crowd. Laid off from his job
as a management information systems specialist, LeCouteur turned to
making fire apparatuses.</TE>
<TE>   At Fireplay, LeCouteur frequently safety-tests his equipment,
which includes an ignitable fire whip and a pair of Kevlar wick-lined
fiberglass bat-wings that extend from the performer's back. He also
rehearses there with the fire performance troupe the Flamethrowers,
who perform at clubs and social functions throughout Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Such paying jobs are hard to come by. Venue owners are jumpy and
permits costly. The Los Angeles Fire Department requires "open flame
acts" to submit a written permit proposal. Then typically, a fire
marshal will witness the act as well as a pre-performance
run-through--with the promoter paying the marshal $55 an hour for a
four-hour minimum, says Inspector Michael Riley of the LAFD's Public
Assemblage Unit. Since most performers are lucky to net $150 for an
entire night, many of them believe there is a better, more
cost-effective way of making everyone happy: setting professional
standards.</TE>
<TE>   LeCouteur has founded the North American Fire Arts Assn., a
professional guild that seeks to establish a national professional
policy based on the safety rules and requirements serious fire
performers already follow. "The idea is that if our internal quality
guidelines are harsher than what the individual states would apply,
then guild membership and accreditation would account for more than
state licensing would in and of itself," he asserts.</TE>
<TE>   The plan has a ways to go. Local fire officials have jurisdiction
over open flame acts, says the state fire marshal's office, so any
guidelines would have to be approved locality by locality.</TE>
<TE>   And defining what constitutes a safe fire performance isn't easy,
says LeCouteur. He's working to do that with other Fire Arts Assn.
members, mainly senior members of the Burning Man Festival's Fire
Conclave, which fire-dances around the festival's "man" during the
annual "Burn." The aim, he says, is "making sure that you're not
taking undue risks that could potentially endanger somebody's life.
Some of them are obvious. Some of them are very subtle, like you have
to keep your fuel capped when you're indoors. It might let off a
vapor cloud that could take any spark in 100 meters and transfer it
back to the source."</TE>
<TE>   L.A.'s fire performers have already proved themselves to Al
Fellerman, who insures most national fire performers through his
brokerage firm Clowns of the U.S. In seven years of insuring fire
performers, he says they have yet to file a claim. "I don't see any
more danger with these [fire performers] as with someone falling off
of a high wire. They're really careful. So we have no qualms with
them doing this."</TE>
<TE>   As artists, fire performers are also pushing forward. Moving
beyond the brief solo presentations of most modern fire performances,
troupes such as L.A.'s Midnight Sun, San Francisco's Seeds of Fire
and Seattle's Cirque du Flambe are integrating fire performance with
theater, dance and acrobatics.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody can jump around and spin fire and the audience will go,
'Ooo, ahhh!' But can you take it to the next step, where it's not the
whole focus, but something you're using as part of your art?" asks
Crimson Rose, leader of the Burning Man Festival's Fire Conclave. "It
isn't, 'Here, let me spin around.' It's actually the whole dynamics,
where you're building something to a height and you're coming back
down. That's really what I'm seeing happen with these groups."</TE>

<LD>The Torah</LD>
<LD>   Did you know that the Torah, the first five books of the Jewish
Bible, is the Jewish people's most cherished and holy text? It is
about 3,300 years old. The Torah is even too sacred to be touched by
human hands, so it is read with the help of a yad, or pointer.</LD>
<LD>   The Torah is so special that it must be written by a sofer, a
person who writes a new copy of the Torah according to specific
rules. The sofer must go to the ritual bath, the mikveh, before he or
she begins working on the Torah. The sofer must write with a quill
(feather) and ink on parchment (the skin of a kosher cow). Also, the
new Torah must be so perfect that if the sofer makes a mistake, that
section must be rewritten.</LD>
<TE>   The Simon Wiesenthal Center Museum of Tolerance has two Torah
scrolls on display in its Multimedia Learning Center. One scroll
looks dirty and torn because it was almost destroyed by the Nazis
(German soldiers) in Tarnow, Poland, during World War II. The other
Torah scroll is also ripped because it had to be protected from the
Nazis.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 3, 1942, the Nazis were preparing to send Jews from
Wolbrom, Poland, to their deaths. A rabbi and other Jewish leaders in
the town collected as many Torahs as they could and buried them in a
Jewish cemetery. They wanted to protect the Torahs from being damaged
or burned by the Nazis. After the war, the son of one of the men who
buried the scrolls found a Torah in an elderly woman's cellar. He
gave the Torah scroll to the Museum of Tolerance.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Sunday at 6:50 a.m. John Leonard may be one of the few
intellectuals in Manhattan on his way to work. Or, perhaps, the only
member of the literati even awake at this hour, except, of course,
for those who still consider it Saturday night. "In my drinking days,
I thought I was a night person," the 63-year-old Leonard says,
walking on an empty West 57th Street to tape his spot as media critic
for CBS' "Sunday Morning." "But it was just the booze. When I
stopped, I realized that I liked going to bed and getting up early."</LD>
<LD>   The massive CBS Building squats on a long block sloping down
toward the Hudson River, gleaming in the bright morning. The writer
calls his Sunday critiques, which usually run four to six minutes,
"sermonettes." And he is something of a political chaplain, using wit
to put across liberal orthodoxy from his '60s active service in the
antiwar and civil rights movements. But Leonard can never quite be
pigeon-holed, calling down God's wrath on American magazines, for
example, from what seems a conservative pulpit: "Why should we shrug
our shoulders at the glossy triumph of the kind of scratch-and-sniff
journalism that, between pornographic ads for vodka and dot-coms,
postures in front of experience instead of engaging it?"</LD>
<TE>   Or calls for plagues on both political houses by arguing that they
have sold out to the ruminations of one man, "the gnome of the Fed,
Alan 'Chuckles' Greenspan." And he is the rare intellectual, on the
left or the right, who not only admits to watching commercial TV, but
enthusiastically praises it as "weirdly democratic, multicultural,
utopian, quixotic and rather more welcoming of difference and
diversity than the audience watching it." Leonard is as happy quoting
Karl Marx as he is Ed Sullivan.</TE>
<TE>   In his 10th book, a recently published collection of essays titled
"Lonesome Rangers: Homeless Minds, Promised Lands, Fugitive Cultures"
(he's fond of subtitles; his last book, "When the Kissing Had to
Stop," pulls a rollicking 36-word train behind it), the author
describes himself as having once been "the young man from the
provinces," that 19th century avatar of ambition, talent and cunning,
who comes up to the Capitol burning to make good. Leonard's province
was postwar Southern California, Lakewood, to be precise, where he
grew up "word-drunk and moon-maddened."</TE>
<TE>   Walking quickly through the narrow CBS corridors, he points out
"the Edward R. Murrow Room, the only place we could smoke." He smiles
nostalgically, "Yeah, that was the Black Lung Room." A locomotive
smoker for more than four decades, Leonard, feeling perfectly fine,
went for a chest X-ray late last year and in January found himself on
an operating table having 40% of his right lung cut out. Practically
race-walking though the maze of the building, he talks about the
difficulties of working without his beloved Tareytons. "I've got to
find a new dance at the keyboard."</TE>
<TE>   Lean, long-faced, terrier-quick and nervous, Leonard responds to
questions tentatively at first, searching, like all good writers, for
the proper opening. After a false start or two he plunges ahead and
speaks the way he writes; intense, amused, full bore.</TE>
<TE>   "I first went on the air back in the '70s doing book reviews for
local news. But," he says with a wicked grin, "when I talked about a
biography of Leon Trotsky they suddenly didn't want me anymore."</TE>
<TE>   More than 40 years ago he arrived and hopped "onto the pogo stick
of a New York career," working for the New York Times for 16 years,
including five as editor of the Book Review, which he transformed
from the Buckingham Palace of American letters (either you were asked
in, turned away, or, with excruciating ceremony, thrown out) to
something open and inclusive. He has been literary editor of the
Nation, is in his 19th year as the weekly TV critic for New York
magazine and has had the CBS gig for 13 years.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the books (including a novel set in Long Beach,
"Crybaby of the Western World"), he's written for everything from
"the old weekly Life before it died for People's sins," to Playboy
and TV Guide. He describes what he does as "sorting the signals of an
overheated publicity culture, manufacturing opinions instead of
widgets."</TE>
<TE>   A subversive with a smile on his face, Leonard lays landmines for
sleepwalkers strolling through a book review, a magazine column, a TV
appearance. He believes politics and culture are two sides of the
corporate coin, and in the Orwellian notion that professing no
politics is in itself a political act.</TE>
<TE>   His work succeeds because he's funny and not, like most of his
peers, merely clever. Part of his technique is long lists, providing
souped-up rhythms with juxtapositions that are revelatory and
slapstick at the same time. In "Lonesome Rangers," names are
roller-coastered together to make a point about the absurd, yet
age-old, practice of living vicariously through manipulated images of
celebrity: Chaucer and Edith Wharton, Helen of Troy and Jodie Foster,
Plutarch and Liz Smith. It jolts a reader into the recognition that
chronicling celebrities is as old as storytelling, and now American
media are perfecting the coverage of personality to the point of
deafening overload, drowning out information about the real world.</TE>
<TE>   It's curious to learn that Leonard began on the opposite pole of
politics, working for William Buckley's National Review. Twenty years
old and writing captions for UPI in New York, he got a call out of
the blue from Buckley who had seen something Leonard had written for
an academic magazine. Soon he was in Havana covering the first weeks
of the triumphant revolution, close enough to hear the firing squads
in the sports stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Pouring coffee, Leonard remembers, "I was one of what Buckley
calls the apostates. He hired Garry Wills, Joan Didion and Renata
Adler, and thought the charismatics of his personality would take
care of the politics. But he had no illusion about me from the
start." (Reached later, Buckley said, "John was with us a year or
two, drank deeply but insubstantially of conservative doctrine, and
went off to distinguish himself." Recalling that in 1975 Leonard went
to Moscow, "I think they gave him a potion that put the finishing
touches on his apostasy, leaving him otherwise as we found him, a
dazzling writer, and a nice man.")</TE>
<TE>   At the studio, Charles Osgood, the host of "Sunday Morning,"
floats in, looking like a benevolent but befuddled country doctor who
has lost his way. Asked about Leonard, he takes a second and then, in
that rumble of a voice, says, "Very simply, and most importantly,
John Leonard elevates the American discussion."</TE>
<TE>   Leonard goes on the set and sits next to Osgood. He crosses his
legs, folds his hands in his lap and is still. One take and he nails
it. ("John never misses," the stage manager says later.
"Letter-perfect every time.")</TE>
<TE>   His piece this day is about the re-release of "ET: The
Extraterrestrial." Twenty years ago seems like a century, he tells
his audience, when aliens were "friendly and playful," seeking
communication. Now aliens want to "abduct our children and steal our
sperm. It's as if our imagination of the other has regressed to the
darkest days of the Cold War '50s, when sci-fi films were full of
pods, blobs, body snatchers and collectivized Bolshevik killer ants."</TE>
<TE>   You can tell America's mood and prophesize its political future,
Leonard goes on, by examining its entertainment. Paranoia in fantasy
mirrors something closer to reality in the body politic.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty minutes later he's walking on a block on the Upper East
Side toward a townhouse he shares with his wife, Sue, and "ten
[thousand] or twelve thousand books, we're not really sure." In an
upstairs sitting room he talks of how he was formed by a vanishing
act, a central theme of "Lonesome Rangers." His mother took
8-year-old John and his younger brother from Washington, D.C., to
California, leaving behind her husband, "a very gentle Irish drunk.
My mother decided she couldn't stand it anymore and set out to find
something, as far away as possible from everything. She's an
extraordinary woman, 82 now, still living in Lakewood on Nixon
Street, which, as a lifelong Democrat, has always irritated her."</TE>
<TE>   Downstairs in his office, he talks of how the process of writing
has changed from when he was editor of the student paper at Woodrow
Wilson High School in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "My whole writing life they've been removing senses. You had ink,
you had paper, you had tactility. I was at the [New York] Times when
they closed down the linotype machines, put down carpets, took away
the sounds of typewriter keys, carriages and bells, and made paper
disappear. But once I started with a computer I realized I was back
where I began in high school, that it was a doodle until I chose to
make it into a sentence. Once that happened, it restored something in
me that had been lost. Playing."</TE>
<TE>   In one essay in "Lonesome Rangers," Leonard examines Elizabeth
Hardwick's work, but could be writing about himself, creating
literature as somehow playing at jujitsu: "We have been thrown by our
own weight, tumbled into deeper meanings, rueful reflections, and
surprise perspectives."</TE>

<HD>The New Colors of Love</HD>
<DH>Though diamonds still rule, more brides-to-be are breaking
with tradition by selecting engagement rings from a rainbow of gems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILARY E. MacGREGOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kim Stevenson thinks of herself as an old-fashioned girl. So when she
and her fiance got engaged, they went shopping for a diamond ring,
just like they were supposed to. "I looked at diamonds and I just
didn't feel much," said Stevenson, 36. "They just seemed so plain to
me."</LD>
<LD>   She came home instead with a velvety blue sapphire that spoke to
her soul. The crystal blue of the stone makes her think of the ocean,
the sky and the time she and her man lived by the beach, during their
early courtship. "I didn't expect to get a sapphire," said Stevenson,
a writer who lives in Thousand Oaks and plans to marry in June. "But
I guess I wasn't going to let tradition make me wear a ring I didn't
like."</LD>
<LD>   I know what she means. I recently became engaged and had to face
the diamond dilemma, too. Diamonds are a symbol of love, but I don't
really like them. I prefer the fire of rubies, and the glow of
emeralds to the cool sparkle of diamonds. So for my engagement ring,
my fiance and I chose a ring with an Australian opal that glimmers
green and blue like winter waves. It was designed by goldsmith Amy
Moss, who works out of a horse trailer in Malibu, and I love it.</LD>
<TE>   But I have to wonder, will people even know it's an engagement
ring? In some repressed feminist way, do I secretly like that they
might not? Am I a contrarian freak?</TE>
<TE>   Much as I hate to admit it, I seem to be part of a trend, albeit a
small one.</TE>
<TE>   Moss, who designs custom jewelry that looks like it was unearthed
from Egyptian tombs, said her clients are often interested in unusual
pieces.</TE>
<TE>   "Diamonds will always be beautiful," Moss said. "But they are more
of a man's idea of doing what their Mom wanted. It's not the creative
decision. It's the young, blushing bride that will choose a diamond.
It usually indicates the wealth of the husband."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly the vast majority of women--and, more important,
men--still believe diamonds are a girl's best friend. But evidence is
emerging--in anecdotes and in the press--that there is growing
interest in non-diamond engagement rings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a nontraditional choice that more and more people are
prepared to make," said Douglas Hucker, executive director of the
Dallas-based American Gem Trade Assn., which promotes the sale of
colored gemstones in North America. "I think people are feeling less
constrained by tradition all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Orman, spokeswoman for New York-based Jewelry Information
Center, said that alternative gemstones made a splash in 1981, when
Lady Diana Spencer--who starred in the biggest bridal princess
fantasy in the latter half of the last century--was presented with a
sapphire engagement ring, surrounded by diamonds. The choice startled
a world trained to love diamonds, and opened the door, ever so
slightly, to options.</TE>
<TE>   The more recent interest in alternative gemstone rings, said
Orman, is driven by demographics and economics. Women are marrying
later, making more money and developing their own sense of identity
and style before they wed. Between 1998 and 1999--the most recent
period for which statistics are available-- women spent $12.1 billion
on diamond jewelry for themselves, a 41% increase over the year
before, according to Orman.</TE>
<TE>   By the time these "female self-purchasers" get engaged, they have
already draped sapphires around their necks, hung rubies from their
ears, or slipped diamonds onto their own fingers.</TE>
<TE>   "The few extra years of singledom serves to solidify one's
personal tastes," said Elizabeth Florence, the Jewelry Information
Center's executive director. "More than ever, women are involved in
the process of picking out the engagement ring. If they prefer a
different gem, they are not afraid to address that."</TE>
<TE>   Jane Bohan, an award-winning New York-based designer who focuses
on gemstone jewelry, says part of this shift is simply availability.
"You think of what was offered 20 years ago, and you just did not see
a sapphire with these arrangements around them," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The glossy pages of women's bridal magazines reflect this
increased openness, availability--and curiosity--about non-diamond
rings. "Perhaps by now you've noticed the color-is-hot trend in all
things bridal," begins an article titled "Gem Dandy" in the
November/December 2001 issue of Bridal Guide.</TE>
<TE>   "Is a diamond really my best friend--or would I swap her for a
sapphire?" asks "Ring in the New," an article in In Style's January
wedding issue. Modern Bride plans to run a story on sapphire
engagement rings in its June/July issue.</TE>
<TE>   "Slowly, things are starting to change," said Tania Riddell,
Modern Bride's accessories editor. "Slowly, you are seeing more
colored rings out there. Women, girls, just want something different.
There are just so many choices out there, and finally consumers are
becoming aware of that."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, most women will stick with diamonds. According to the
Diamond Information Center, which tracks industry trends, 84% of all
U.S. brides celebrated their engagement with a diamond engagement
ring last year.</TE>
<TE>   And Rob Bates, diamond reporter for the trade publication
Jeweler's Circular Keystone, said he does not see any evidence of a
trend of women opting for stones other than diamonds. "De Beer's
research from the last year shows that acquisition rates are steady,"
Bates said. "I think they [gemstones] are something that a more
sophisticated customer might want. But you have got to understand
that most people buying engagement rings are men. They can barely
understand buying a diamond, and then all of a sudden he is supposed
to buy a sapphire, or a ruby? He is just totally clueless."</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to get reliable information on the history of engagement
rings from a source not affiliated with the diamond industry. But
before the middle of the last century, if women even wore an
engagement ring, it would typically contain her birthstone.</TE>
<TE>   The grip of the diamond on the American psyche did not come until
the 1930s, when De Beers--which by then controlled an estimated 90%
of the world's rough diamonds-- hired the advertising agency NW Ayer
to win over the largest market in the world.</TE>
<TE>   In 1947, a copywriter at NW Ayer coined the slogan "A diamond is
forever." That phrase is the most recognized ad slogan of the 20th
century, according to Advertising Age.</TE>
<TE>   De Beers also came up with the "rule" that a man should spend one
month's salary on a diamond engagement ring; somewhere along the way
that leaped to two months' salary.</TE>
<TE>   Bates said De Beers has successfully made diamond engagement rings
into a "cultural imperative."</TE>
<TE>   "The whole idea behind diamond advertising is that a man doesn't
love you if he doesn't give you a diamond ring. The diamond you give
symbolizes how much you love her. It is very clever ... 'If you love
your fiancee, you will write a check to us.'"</TE>
<TE>   So far, no one has been able to sever the tie between diamonds and
love. "I think that when you have an organization like De Beers,
which spends $200 million a year advertising love and romance, it is
hard to get a woman to think of anything else," said William E.
Boyajian, president of the Carlsbad-based Gemological Institute of
America, which trains jewelers. "It keeps people from thinking of
other stones, unless they have a genuine love for rubies, sapphires
or opals. I think it just does not even occur to you. There is no De
Beers of the colored-stone world."</TE>
<TE>   Hucker of the American Gem Trade Assn. does not dispute that
diamonds remain the engagement ring of choice, but said the way data
are collected is unlikely to pick up on new trends. "I don't think
there are any statistics on how many women buy colored gemstones as
opposed to diamonds for their engagement rings," he said. "It has not
been a tradition to ask, 'How many of your rings used natural colored
stones as the center stone?'"</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, reports that trade in rough diamonds has funded
and prolonged bloody regional conflicts in Africa threatened to taint
the carefully cultivated image of diamonds. But the industry has
taken steps to avoid a public relations debacle. (See accompanying
story.)</TE>
<TE>   Unlike gold, which has a world market price, the price of jewels
ranges widely. According to Stuart Robertson, research director of
Gemworld International, which publishes the Guide, the retail price
for a top-quality, 1-carat, brilliant-cut stone varies widely--from
$2,700 to $3,600 for a sapphire; $4,500 to 5,500 for an emerald;
$5,000 to 7,500 for a ruby; and $13,000 to $16,500 for a diamond.</TE>
<TE>   The De Beers logic worked with Shawn O'Connor, 42, of Redondo
Beach, who proposed to his girlfriend April 5 with a diamond ring.
"Anything less than a diamond is ... not looked down on, but
certainly something you have to consider. How true could my feelings
be if I skimp on a diamond for her?"</TE>
<TE>   Women who opt for non-diamond rings seem to play an active role in
selecting their rings, and seem to be slightly older than the average
first-time bride, who is 25. Diane Martinson of New York got married
for the first time in her late 40s to a man she met on a garden tour
of Italy. She wears a second-century Roman ring of imperial gold with
a jasper and a figure of a lion. It is so tiny she must wear it on
her pinkie.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband offered me his grandmother's diamond in a Tiffany
setting, a lovely setting with prongs and everything," she said. "I
didn't want to hurt his feelings, but I said, 'I would never really
wear that ring.'</TE>
<TE>   "I told my mother I had turned the diamond down and she said,
'What, are you, nuts?'"</TE>
<TE>   Often women who receive alternative gemstone rings have an unusual
ring somewhere in their family history. That was true for Emily
Culbertson, 30, of Philadelphia as well as her fiance. Her own mother
had two engagement rings--a diamond and an opal; her fiance's mother
had a ruby.</TE>
<TE>   But finding something different proved more difficult than she
thought. "It's not as easy or simple to walk into a jeweler and say,
'I'd like to see six sapphires,' as it is to walk in and say, 'I'd
like to see six square-cut diamonds,'" said Culbertson, who
researched rings for weeks on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, she bought a sapphire she loves from a jeweler in
Boise, Idaho. "I can still do what every engaged women does,"
Culbertson said. "Which is hold up my hand, and there is a ring on my
fourth finger and people know I am engaged. In that way, it has been
effective."</TE>
<TE>   Do men feel slighted when their women choose color?</TE>
<TE>   Mark Henderson, 41, of Thousand Oaks, who will tie the knot with
Kim Stevenson in June, said the idea of breaking with the diamond
convention appealed to him. Above all, though, he wanted to choose a
ring that made his fiancee happy. "To me a ring is a ring," he said.
"Whether it is plastic or a solitaire diamond, to me it doesn't make
a great deal of difference."</TE>

<HD>Rough Trade Tarnishes World of Rough Diamonds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILARY E. MacGREGOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1998, Global Witness, a London-based nongovernmental organization
that focuses on the links between environmental and human-rights
abuses, published a groundbreaking report on "conflict" or "blood
diamonds."</LD>
<LD>   The report documented how trade in rough diamonds has funded and
prolonged conflicts in Angola and Sierra Leone. De Beers and Global
Witness define "conflict diamonds" as those that originate from areas
in Africa controlled by forces fighting against legitimate
governments. Small, valuable, and easily concealed, many of these
diamonds have fueled resistance for years and found their way into
the legitimate diamond industry.</LD>
<LD>   The report focused particularly on De Beers and its subsidiaries.
In 1996, De Beers was sorting, valuing and selling about 80% of the
world's diamond production. Today, this figure stands at about 65%,
since new mines owned by other companies in Australia and Canada have
increased the diamond supply.</LD>
<TE>   According to Global Witness, De Beers' annual reports during the
1990s make it clear the company was buying rough diamonds in Angola
at a time when the country was engaged in a long and bloody civil
war.</TE>
<TE>   Conflict diamonds are estimated to constitute 3% to 4% of the
world's diamond supply. But the diamond industry was not about to
allow the issue to overshadow the carefully cultivated image of
diamonds and romance.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, De Beers announced an embargo on all diamonds from Angola
by its buying offices around the world. Sierra Leone was later added
to the list. In 2000, producers, manufacturers, traders, diamond
companies and others formed the World Diamond Council to develop a
system to track the export and import of rough diamonds to prevent
their exploitation for illicit purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Governments, industry and nongovernmental organizations have tried
to develop a system to ensure that conflict diamonds do not enter the
legal trading system. Last year, the U.S. House of Representatives
passed a version of the Clean Diamond Trade Act, which provides the
president authority to block rough diamond imports from countries
that do not have safeguards against the trade in conflict diamonds.
The bill is pending in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   William Boyajian, president of the Gemological Institute of
America, said he remembers the conference he attended at the State
Department several years ago when conflict diamonds were first
brought up. "Frankly, I think it was news to a lot of people,"
Boyajian said. "Even to someone like me, who has been in the business
25 years. I think the industry was first shocked, then angry, because
what about oil, what about arms [in terms of fueling conflicts] until
very soon after that, the clearer reality emerged that if this was
going on it was something the industry wanted to confront."</TE>
<TE>   Most jewelers said consumers appear unaware or unaffected by the
issue. Jeweler's Circular Keystone, an industry trade publication,
conducted a survey about a year ago asking retail jewelers if their
customers ever mentioned "conflict diamonds." Of 223 respondents,
85.7% of jewelers said their customers did not ask; 14.3% said they
had received inquiries. "There are certainly some folks, particularly
in areas where there is a tendency to latch onto a cause du jour, who
will eschew diamonds," said Hedda Schupak, editor of Jeweler's
Circular Keystone.</TE>
<TE>   "But as an industry observer, I don't see it as a trend across the
nation."</TE>

<LD>When Max Klein played handball, he could do anything. He could jump
up high, he could hit the ball low, he could even spin around on one
heel and zoom the ball through the other kids' legs. But there was
one thing Max couldn't do. He couldn't tie his own shoes.</LD>
<LD>   Every day during recess, Max and his friends played handball. And
every day when the bell rang, Max's shoelaces were untied.</LD>
<LD>   "The game is over!" yelled Ray one morning, hearing the bell. Ray
was the meanest kid in Room 12, and everybody knew it.</LD>
<TE>   Max looked down at his feet. "Not again!" he cried.</TE>
<TE>   "You're in for it, Max," said Ray. "Mr. Peters doesn't like to tie
kids' shoes." Max could feel sweat dribbling down the sides of his
face, and his stomach started turning in knots.</TE>
<TE>   "I know," said Max, feeling helpless.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody line up!" bellowed Mr. Peters, the teacher, stepping
outside his classroom door.</TE>
<TE>   As Max and Ray hurried over to join the line, the worst thing that
could happen, did. Max tripped on his shoelace, tumbling onto the
concrete.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Peters helped him up. "Are you all right?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," said Max, biting his lower lip and trying not to cry.</TE>
<TE>   "Max," he said, kneeling down on one knee. "You need to be able to
tie your own shoes. I don't want you to get hurt."</TE>
<TE>   "OK, Mr. Peters," said Max, standing as still as a statue, feeling
embarrassed.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Peters quickly tied Max's shoe. Max hurried to the end of the
line, right behind Ray.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Max," said Ray, turning toward him slowly, with a grin.
"I'll bet you one dollar you still can't tie your shoes tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes I can!" blurted Max. "I'll learn to tie my own shoes. I can
do it."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to be rich!" Ray said.</TE>
<TE>   "Not if you lose," Max said. "Then you'll be giving me one
dollar."</TE>
<TE>   Just then Max thought about his piggybank at home in his bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   "Uh-oh!" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: Does Max have a dollar in his piggybank?</TE>

<LD>Wartime code breaking has become a popular theme running through
today's films. It is a key plot device in this year's Oscar-winning
"A Beautiful Mind," in which Nobel laureate mathematician John Nash,
played by Russell Crowe, tries to break a secret code as he struggles
with schizophrenia. And it underlies the plot of this summer's John
Woo film, "Windtalkers," which follows the exploits of Navajo
code-talkers who are recruited as Marines during World War II to
frustrate Japanese efforts to break America's secret military codes.</LD>
<LD>   The latest of the code-breaker films opens Friday, as director
Michael Apted's World War II thriller "Enigma" makes its U.S.
premiere in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago. By May, it will be in
150 to 200 theaters across the country.</LD>
<LD>   Produced by "Saturday Night Live" executive producer Lorne
Michaels and Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger (through the
singer's Jagged Films production company), the film is set in
Bletchley Park, where the best minds in Britain gathered to crack the
German code. The Tom Stoppard script, based on a Robert Harris novel,
tells the story of the Enigma coding machine and the extraordinary
challenges to decoding it, paying homage to the unsung
mathematicians, linguists and electrical engineers whose work helped
shorten the war and accelerated the development of computers.</LD>
<TE>   The film marks the emergence of New York-based distributor
Manhattan Pictures International, whose president and CEO, Paul
Cohen, calls it "serendipitous" that all three of these movies about
code-breakers are coming out in the aftermath of Sept. 11. He said
"Enigma" captures the essence of how the "common man" rises up in the
face of a great challenge at an important moment in history to
accomplish a great task. The film stars Dougray Scott, Kate Winslet,
Jeremy Northam and Saffron Burrows.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>That Saturday's Audiotistic festival worked on any artistic level is
a true testament to the music. In its fifth year, the concert was
moved to the National Orange Show in San Bernardino, a concrete
jungle that, while friendly to raves, is so uninviting that it can
make fans yearn for the sweaty, crowded Hollywood Palladium.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, last year's event (held at the Long Beach Convention
Center) nearly saw the music overwhelmed by the size and spectacle,
and that was with just 15,000 fans. Saturday's show drew in the
vicinity of 35,000.</LD>
<LD>   And crowds were a problem. During the peak times of the night, it
could take up to 20 minutes to get from one stage to another, and
food lines never eased up. Despite the long waits and constant
pushing from all sides, police reported no incidents, and fans seemed
remarkably controlled.</LD>
<TE>   While headliners such as Grammy nominee OutKast and the Roots
might have been the ticket-sellers, Audiotistic also lived up to its
boast of being "the future sound festival" by assembling a stellar
under-card of cutting-edge acts from the worlds of hip-hop and
electronic music.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, fans had the option of seeing Mos Def on the hip-hop
stage or heading to the outdoor house stage for King Britt. During
the busiest portion of the evening, critically acclaimed rapper Talib
Kweli, house DJ Roy Davis Jr. and trance star DJ Dan were playing on
three different stages.</TE>
<TE>   And arguably the most impressive set at that time was found on the
drum-and-bass stage, where Craze, DJ Markie and MC Skibadee were
warming up the crowd for Roni Size and Dynamite with a blend of
fast-paced beats and Jamaican dance-hall vocals.</TE>
<TE>   Kweli's melodic, harmony-rich tunes, including the seldom-played
"Brown Confetti" and some "new twangs," were highly appealing, as
were Davis' warm dance grooves, which provided a nice respite from
the aggressive nature of the other stages. Indeed, the house, or
lagoon, area, with the only grassy field at the Orange Show,
resembled a jam band festival.</TE>
<TE>   At other noteworthy moments, Dave Aude's dramatic keyboard rises
had the progressive building jumping, while the main stage/hip-hop
area was packed throughout the night, from Mos Def's set to OutKast's
crowd-pleasing finale, which, in keeping with the theme of the night,
featured an abundance of hard-edged beats delivered with the band's
usual energy.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Audiotistic's flaws--the crowd issues, the setting and the
blatant commercialism (sections of the grounds looked more like a
flea market than a concert)--attendees were visibly happy with the
event.</TE>
<TE>   As much as people want spectacle, it's still the music that
matters the most.</TE>

<LD>Hollywood is full of enough award shows to keep the tuxedo-rental
business hopping through much of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Still, one of the hardest tickets in town to get skews toward less
formal--or at least more pint-sized--attire: Nickelodeon's annual
Kids' Choice Awards, which will be held and televised Saturday night
from Santa Monica Airport's Barker Hanger.</LD>
<LD>   Kids' Choice has become such a prized event because the children
of entertainment industry executives and stars clamor to attend,
leaving the cable network struggling to accommodate a huge roster of
VIP guests in a venue that seats only 1,500. As it is, many industry
executives are currently on a waiting list, and Nickelodeon reports
that all of its media credentials have been exhausted.</LD>
<TE>   Rosie O'Donnell is making her sixth appearance as host of the
show, which is marking its 15th anniversary. The roster of
presenters, not surprisingly, skews toward films, TV shows and
musical acts with some presumed youth appeal, among them "Malcolm in
the Middle's" Frankie Muniz, wrestler-turned-actor the Rock and
Spider-man.</TE>
<TE>   But parents seeking tickets should be forewarned what to expect by
the theme of this year's show: "Bigger! Louder! Messier!"</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson's "Changing Lanes" drew heavy
traffic as the drama about two men bent on revenge after a
fender-bender debuted in the No. 1 spot with $17.6 million this
weekend.</LD>
<LD>   "Panic Room," the top film for the last two weekends, slipped to
second with $11.3 million, while Cameron Diaz's romantic comedy "The
Sweetest Thing" opened at No. 3 with $10 million, according to studio
estimates Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The horror flick "Frailty," starring Matthew McConaughey and Bill
Paxton, premiered with $4.2 million, tying for eighth place with
"National Lampoon's Van Wilder."</LD>
<TE>   In narrower release, the satiric comedy "Human Nature" opened
weakly with $300,000, averaging a meager $1,339 in 224 theaters. The
film stars Patricia Arquette and Tim Robbins and was written by
Charlie Kaufman ("Being John Malkovich").</TE>
<TE>   "Changing Lanes" averaged $6,716 in 2,613 theaters, compared with
$3,745 in 2,670 cinemas for "The Sweetest Thing" and $2,806 in 1,497
locations for "Frailty."</TE>
<TE>   The overall box office continued a string of up weekends. The top
12 films grossed $84.1 million, an 11.5% increase from the same
weekend a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, Hollywood has posted domestic revenues of about
$2.25 billion, 18% ahead of last year's pace, when the industry set a
yearlong record of $8.4 billion, said Paul Dergarabedian, president
of box-office tracker Exhibitor Relations.</TE>
<TE>   Healthy spring business could boost Hollywood's busy summer
season, which gets an early start next weekend with the debut of "The
Scorpion King," a spinoff of "The Mummy" franchise starring pro
wrestler the Rock.</TE>
<TE>   "Changing Lanes" benefited from generally positive reviews,
Affleck's allure to women and Jackson's appeal to black audiences,
said Wayne Lewellen, head of distribution for Paramount, which
released the film. The audience was split 50-50 between men and
women, and about 70% was older than 25, he said.</TE>
<TE>   That demographic breakdown should help "Changing Lanes" hold up
against "The Scorpion King," which is expected to appeal largely to
teenage boys and young males, Lewellen said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Sweetest Thing" drew mainly 17- to 25-year-olds and a largely
female audience, said Jeff Blake, president of worldwide marketing
and distribution for Sony, which released the movie.</TE>
<TE>   The reissue of "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" took in $1.5 million,
pushing its four-week gross to $32.9 million. The movie's 20-year
total climbed to $432.7 million, edging past "Star Wars: Episode I
The Phantom Menace" for No. 3 on the all-time domestic box-office
chart.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the weekend's top 10 were "Ice Age" at No. 4 with an
estimated $8.7 million, followed by "The Rookie" with $8.1 million,
"High Crimes" with $8 million, "Clockstoppers" with $4.8 million,
"Frailty," and "Van Wilder" and "Blade II" with $4.1 million.</TE>

<HD>Capturing America's Image--the Glossy and the Dark</HD>
<DH>Photography* Two N.Y. exhibitions reveal how the camera and
its artist can shape the look and feel of an era, a historic event or
an urban vision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIELLA BUDICK</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A matched pair of photojournalism shows at the International Center
of Photography chronicles the struggle between an explosive medium
and one of its more celebrated practitioners.</LD>
<LD>   "Rise of the Picture Press: Photographic Reportage in Illustrated
Magazines, 1918-1939" documents the early years after the development
of small hand-held cameras, high-speed roll film and the half-tone
printing process that allowed publications to accompany stories with
photographs rather than engravings.</LD>
<LD>   The need for vivid and graphic dispatches from the front lines
during World War I led to an explosion of news photography, and the
exhibit traces the birth of publications from Germany's Berliner
Illustrierte Zeitung to an American latecomer, Life magazine, which
published its first issue in 1936.</LD>
<TE>   For the next few decades, Life would shape the glossy look of an
era, thanks to the eyes of photographers such as W. Eugene Smith,
whose gritty, noir-ish composite portrait of mid-century Pittsburgh
form the accompanying show, "Dream Street." Smith, who was born in
1918, was reared at Life, becoming one of the magazine's prodigies
when he was in his 20s and satisfying the publication's demand for
uplifting photo essays on stories of human dignity and moral
righteousness.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Luce, the magazine's publisher, described Life's ideal
content as "big pictures, beautiful pictures, exciting pictures,
pictures from all over the world, pictures of interesting people and
lots of babies."</TE>
<TE>   Smith complied: He followed a country doctor on his rounds,
rendered homage to a black nurse-midwife in the impoverished South
Carolina countryside and accompanied Albert Schweitzer on his medical
missions to Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Then something snapped. It's this juncture, when Smith quit one of
the world's best jobs in 1954, that gives "Dream Street" its sad and
compelling power. The Pittsburgh photographs were Smith's after-Life
magnum opus, and with them he produced a darkly urban vision, less
out of a magazine than out of film noir.</TE>
<TE>   He documented a city devoted to the pursuit of prosperity but
riven by poverty, engulfed in clouds of smoke from the steel mills.</TE>
<TE>   Massive monuments of industry dwarf the lonely citizens, who live
on desolate streets and in squat wooden houses. Smith shot in high
contrast and heightened the dark tints to the point of creepiness.
His favorite picture is a close-up of a steel worker's solemn face,
his skin darkened by grime or shadow, a flaming furnace reflected in
his goggles like a pair of infernal eyes.</TE>
<TE>   The show's curator, Sam Stephenson of Duke University, reads this
expressive photo--and the whole Pittsburgh project--as a
self-portrait of an artist caught between success and despair. Smith
was an alcoholic and a drug addict, with a wife, four children, a
thriving career and a streak of self-destructive purity.</TE>
<TE>   Stephenson sees the paradoxes of a city churning toward progress
and leaving vast segments of its population in squalor as metaphors
for Smith's state of mind.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his tenure at Life, which began in 1939, with a long
interruption for World War II, Smith squabbled with his editors,
accusing them of manipulating his images for crass purposes.</TE>
<TE>   He was a professional in a popular business but never relinquished
a sense of himself as an artist whose motives were pure.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a cult of followers throughout the world who look up to me
as the shining light and the protector of integrity and as the one
who never compromises my beliefs before pressures of the commercial
and outside world," he wrote to his mother in 1953. "Perhaps this ...
is a reason I am unhappy because I am afraid I will let these people
and the world down."</TE>
<TE>   That grandiose fear led him to follow the freelance life and
accept an assignment to illustrate a book commemorating Pittsburgh's
bicentennial.</TE>
<TE>   It was exactly the sort of celebratory civic project that a bold,
gloomy visionary like Smith might have found unpalatable.</TE>
<TE>   But he didn't; he saw it instead as an opportunity to show his
former employers what a truly fine photographer was capable of if
left unconstrained.</TE>
<TE>   His task was to take 100 pictures in three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   He wound up spending a year in Pittsburgh and producing 2,000
prints from 17,000 negatives.</TE>
<TE>   After turning in his 100 photographs, Smith's attempt to make the
whole project cohere consumed three more years, two Guggenheim
fellowships, an advance from the Magnum photo agency and hundreds of
gallons of developing chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   Various publishers were interested, but none was willing to grant
him the complete editorial autonomy he demanded.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Popular Photography magazine agreed to cede him control
over layout and text in its 1959 Photography Annuals.</TE>
<TE>   The result, he immediately concluded, was a complete and abject
disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Smith was defeated by the conventions of the photo essay, a
well-established tradition at Life in which pictures and narrative
were combined to deliver a straightforward story.</TE>
<TE>   The sheer quantity of material he had, and his ambitions to
capture an entire city swamped the genre.</TE>
<TE>   He was not capable of making the necessary choices.</TE>
<TE>   What he was after was not a series of punchy vignettes but a
sprawling epic in the manner of his favorite music: Beethoven's late
string quartets and the rhapsodic improvisations of John Coltrane.</TE>
<TE>   There is something epochal about the conflicts between Smith and
the forms he worked with.</TE>
<TE>   The illustrated magazines whose birth we witness in "Rise of the
Picture Press" were based on the notion that the world can be
packaged in a series of neat visual tales and telling pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's embrace of a vaster, messier version of things foreshadows
the 1960s, when magazines such as Life could no longer shoehorn the
country's sprawling chaos into their tidy formats, especially when
television was feeding rawer, more frenetic images to a public now
ready to absorb them.</TE>

<HD>N.Y.'s Dorfman Troupe Pushes Boundaries in Local Debut</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JENNIFER FISHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Dorfman Dance is a New York-based company that was founded in
1985, but it looks as if it has been simmering since the 1960s,
taking all the loose-limbed, flowing improvisation and pounding
energy of a hazy afternoon rock concert and infusing it with enough
architectural rigor and finely tuned technique to fit into the
high-speed Internet Age.</LD>
<LD>   The troupe's first Southland appearance came courtesy of Cal State
Long Beach, where Dorfman just finished a 21/2-week residency. From
this short stay emerged a premiere, "Striking Distance (Keep Your
Closeness)," which joined two pieces performed by company dancers at
the Carpenter Center on Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   The students did well in their beautifully constructed and staged
piece--which had a rumbling electronic score played live by Stephen
Rush and composer Chris Peck.</LD>
<TE>   But it was the company works, co-choreographed by the dancers,
that really showed Dorfman's talents at full strength.</TE>
<TE>   "To Lie Tenderly" (2000) featured a masterful blending of short,
evocative lines of text and fractured yet musically compelling
movement phrases that owed much to the intimacy of contact
improvisation and the graceful athleticism of capoeira.</TE>
<TE>   Sudden, jittery punches and kicks were balanced by rhapsodic
wheeling and sculptural puzzles. If you were to compare Dorfman's
style to ink on paper, you might say it's a combination of elegant
calligraphy and spontaneous doodling.</TE>
<TE>   Composer Amy Denio's score kept pace--a little punk edge, a rock
'n' roll backbone, a folky-sounding song the dancers sailed away on.</TE>
<TE>   Heard on tape, Denio was seen occasionally in video clips, as was
the occasional dancer; both were projected on the few minimalist
surfaces of the set (by Paul Clay), which looked like a postmodern
drive-in.</TE>
<TE>   Standing out in a strong cast were Jeanine Durning, Joseph Poulson
and Paul Matteson.</TE>
<TE>   Less spoken text was used in "Subverse" (1999), which had the same
fluid combination of unfettered yet sculpted movement.</TE>
<TE>   At some moment, violence and cruel laughter arose, because all is
not rhythmic invention in a Dorfman piece.</TE>
<TE>   It's more like a landscape that you get exhausted trying to take
in but never doubt it's worth the trip.</TE>

<HD>She's After the Other Sweetest Thing</HD>
<DH>Movies* Christina Applegate's 'hot babe' image isn't
holding her career aspirations back.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONA GABLE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Christina Applegate barely pads in the door of the Coffee Bean on
Sunset and pays for her tea when the assault begins. "Oh, no," she
says, ducking her head, her pale eyes searching the busy cafe for a
place to hide. A large man in filthy clothes has spotted the former
teen star and is yammering at her in a loud voice.</LD>
<LD>   As if that weren't awful enough, a tall woman with stringy brown
hair begins harassing her too. "Hey, I'm bisexual!" she shouts.</LD>
<LD>   The scene is both frightening and telling. For Applegate, it shows
the dilemma she still faces in trying to escape her "Married ... With
Children" image as just a lusty babe.</LD>
<TE>   It's an image that gets updated in her new movie, "The Sweetest
Thing," a gal pal comedy that also stars Cameron Diaz and Selma
Blair, in which Applegate plays a sexy divorce lawyer named Courtney
Rockliffe.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney would probably slap the scary guy at the cafe with a
restraining order or at the very least demand that this hirsute giant
and his nasty friend get out of her face. But Applegate does no such
thing. Looking scared, she gently talks to the man as though he were
a disturbed child.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, safely seated at a table outside, Applegate
explains that the man, Travis, is a vagrant from her old Laurel
Canyon neighborhood. "He used to talk to me forever," says the
30-year-old actress. "He wants to hang out with me."</TE>
<TE>   Applegate was then 17, a year into her role as Kelly Bundy on the
raunchy sitcom series "Married ... With Children," and had just moved
into her first house after living with her mother.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of vagrants around that area," she says. "One of
them broke into my house. He got arrested. I don't know if Travis got
arrested. But he was in this circle of bad boys who'd hang around and
drink and bother people."</TE>
<TE>   Now calmed down, Applegate finally gets to the reason she's here:
to discuss her new movie.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in ratty jeans, a tank top and flip-flops, her face bare
of makeup, she looks tiny and delicate. She's also thoughtful,
low-key and nice. It's hard to connect the serious woman sipping tea
with the sexpot she played on TV for 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Sweetest Thing," which opened Friday and took in $10
million at the box office over the weekend, Applegate and her
girlfriends swear a lot, pursue one-night stands and run around in
their underwear. In short, it's single gals in their 20s as you've
rarely seen them, more "American Pie" than "America's Sweethearts."</TE>
<TE>   "I read the script, and I died laughing," Applegate says. "I loved
the way that it really shows the women I know who are stuck in that
stage of life where you're going from being a girl to a woman. You're
looking for more mature relationships, and you're not really sure how
to do that."</TE>
<TE>   The film is being marketed by Sony as a goofy romantic comedy, so
audiences may be surprised by its gross gags and coarse language.</TE>
<TE>   But to Applegate, that's part of its bracing charm. "Women, I
think, talk dirtier than men do behind closed doors," she confides.
"I think women are more willing to use language that isn't really
acceptable with each other. I loved the fact there was that banter."</TE>
<TE>   Understandably, it's not a movie she's going to take her
80-year-old Italian grandmother-in-law to see. "I just don't think
it's the humor of her generation," she says. "I think she'd be
offended by it." Her in-laws, however, were to attend the Los Angeles
premiere. "So we'll see if they still talk to me," she jokes.</TE>
<TE>   Last October, in a small ceremony in Palm Springs presided over by
a Catholic priest and a "metaphysical person," Applegate married her
longtime boyfriend, actor Johnathon Schaech, who has a cameo in the
movie as a hunk she picks up in a club.</TE>
<TE>   Applegate is the kind of person who says things like: "It's not
what happens to you in this life, it's what you do with it." "She's
really got it together," says "Sweetest Thing" director Roger Kumble.
"I don't think she'd mind me saying this, but she's a very spiritual
person."</TE>
<TE>   After a trail of largely forgettable movies, Applegate hopes her
movie career is finally taking off. Next fall, she'll appear in "View
From the Top" with Gwyneth Paltrow, a comedy about two trailer-park
girls and their antics as flight attendants.</TE>
<TE>   Applegate says this is a great time in her life, regardless of the
success of her films. "I love being married," she says. "It's the
biggest joy in the world. I love understanding what love is. And I
don't think any of this," she says, meaning the movie, "would make
any difference in my life if I didn't have that understanding at
home."</TE>
<TE>   Applegate's been working almost nonstop since she was little, when
her mother took her along on her own auditions because she couldn't
pay a baby-sitter. Her parents, actress Nancy Priddy and former
record producer Robert Applegate, split up shortly after she was
born, and Applegate lived with her mother. For a time there wasn't
much money..</TE>
<TE>   "The Sweetest Thing" is the biggest movie to date for Applegate,
who also starred in the NBC show "Jesse," which was canceled last
year after two seasons. But whether the picture will inspire
Hollywood to risk other female-driven comedies is hard to say. Even
Kumble, who jokes that he was probably the only guy on the project,
isn't sure.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a slam dunk," he said in a phone interview. "Men
generally don't go to see these movies. I think men are going to
discover it, but men are not going to rush out to see it."</TE>
<TE>   To play Courtney, Applegate not only had to vie with dozens of
other actresses but also win over Diaz. Applegate isn't afraid to
admit that she really wanted the role.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to do it," she says, trying to talk over the drone of
motorcycles passing by. "I saw Courtney, and I saw so much of myself
there. I went through the same phase of life right before I met my
husband. I used to call it receiving mode. You don't go after guys or
pay much attention whether it's going to be a relationship. It's all
about being with your girlfriends and having a good time."</TE>
<TE>   After reducing the field to a few actresses, Kumble had Applegate
do a couple of scenes with Diaz in a suite at the Chateau Marmont.
"You could tell she embodied the part of Courtney," he says. But
Diaz, who reportedly got $15 million for the film, had the final say.
To make sure the two clicked, Kumble set up a lunch. "I think I said
hello," he deadpans. "About an hour and a half later, I picked up the
check. They just hit it off amazingly well."</TE>
<TE>   "We were kind of all over each other," recalls Applegate. "Not
physically all over each other," she quickly notes. "At least that's
how I felt. I hope she felt the same way."</TE>
<TE>   She did. "The first day we met we looked at each other, 'Let's be
friends,' like kids on the playground," said Diaz by phone from New
York, where the film had premiered the night before.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, like most people, I knew her from 'Married ... With
Children.' I used to always think she was so cool. She's so sexy and
so hot and so funny. She wasn't just some bimbo. You can't play that
part without having cleverness, which takes intelligence."</TE>
<TE>   Back in L.A., Applegate is ducking a question about the other two
actresses she beat for the part when the woman who demanded her
attention earlier wanders up and interrupts. "I just want to know
what your sign is," she says. "Ah, Virgo," Applegate says. "Really?"
says the woman. "That's a good sign. It's been a pleasure meeting
you."</TE>
<TE>   After the woman leaves, the actress confides that she's actually a
Sagittarius. "But she didn't have to know that much about my soul."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if playing Kelly Bundy for so long perhaps prevented her
from being considered for more serious roles, she concedes,
"Probably. I think about this a lot because it's a question I get
asked a lot. It was something I never questioned because I had my own
integrity. I knew what I was doing as far as this was a character I
was playing, and when I went home I was a different person.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people put limits on you," she goes on. "As long as you
don't believe in those limits, you're OK. I'm sure there were doors I
couldn't get in to. I'm sure there are doors I still can't get into.
And that's OK."</TE>

<HD>An Extroverted Take on Shostakovich</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though Shostakovich's symphonies are now being given some priority
downtown by Esa-Pekka Salonen, Jorge Mester beat him to the punch
long ago, dipping into this cycle regularly since near the beginning
of his tenure at the Pasadena Symphony.</LD>
<LD>   Along the way, he has pulled together several distinguished
performances--and to that list, add his rendition of the Symphony No.
15 at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium on Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Every conductor seems to have a different slant on this bafflingly
elusive piece.</LD>
<TE>   Some take Shostakovich at his dubious word and present it as a
distant dream of childhood. Others emphasize satire and mockery or a
stark, chilling terror of death or a lyrical bent or a defeated,
sullen attitude.</TE>
<TE>   Mester offered yet another view, an extroverted one, with a
deliberately paced yet firmly rhythmic grasp on the first movement,
deep yet not brooding brass sonorities elsewhere, the fleeting
climaxes played out in bold, even brash fashion as if this was one of
the vast middle symphonies.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the mesmerizing percussive coda, which some interpret as a
death rattle, it felt like a life-affirming performance, a viewpoint
this work can take.</TE>
<TE>   In the why-didn't-anyone-think-of-this-before department, Mester
shrewdly led off the concert with Rossini's "William Tell" Overture,
whose notorious galloping finale is quoted repeatedly and mockingly
in Shostakovich's first movement.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since the Lone Ranger and Spike Jones had their ways with it,
we've tended to forget how masterfully dramatic this overture is--and
Mester took it seriously, refusing to rush the finale, conjuring
eloquence from the cellos.</TE>
<TE>   Mester also set up Dohnanyi's "Variations on a Nursery Song"
cunningly, making a blasting noise out of the deceptively tragic
introduction so that pianist Robert Edward Thies could get a big
laugh when he pounded out the banal little theme.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Mester caught the broad humor of the Brahms parody
variation, and Thies displayed crystalline clarity throughout.</TE>

<HD>For Now, NBC Anchor Brokaw Remains on Deck</HD>
<DH>Television* Amid reports he's about to retire, the busy
newsman hosts a special on an aircraft carrier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>For a man possibly on the verge of retirement from the "NBC Nightly
News," anchor Tom Brokaw is working awfully hard. Or maybe he's just
trying to get it all in before signing off.</LD>
<LD>   Three weeks ago, Brokaw was reporting from Beirut and Israel. On
his way there, he stopped to spend two days on the U.S. aircraft
carrier John C. Stennis for a one-hour special, "Ship at War: Inside
the Carrier Stennis," which will air Wednesday night. He was
forthcoming about his trip to the Afghanistan war theater, less so
about what he plans to do when his contract expires this summer.</LD>
<LD>   Of whether he plans to stay at the anchor desk or step back into a
less demanding role at NBC News--as he has hinted he might, fueling
speculation in news circles--Brokaw joked, "I'll tell you what I've
told all the other reporters who have asked me: Give me your home
phone number, and you'll be the first person I tell."</LD>
<TE>   He said he expects that his decision will be made sooner rather
than later but declined to say when that would be.</TE>
<TE>   The uncertainty surrounding Brokaw coincides with worries on the
part of some TV industry observers that the evening newscasts could
be in peril once Brokaw, CBS' Dan Rather and ABC's Peter
Jennings--who have each spent almost two decades in their respective
anchor chairs--step down.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent debate was set off when ABC attempted to recruit
comedian David Letterman, which would have bumped ABC News'
"Nightline" from its long-established late-night slot. Brokaw quipped
that he told his friend Letterman to ask for a 6:30 p.m. spot next
time, so the media attention could focus on him.</TE>
<TE>   Brokaw called the debate over the future of broadcast news "an
awful lot of intra-fraternity council stuff going on. The public has
always been able to move from one era to another pretty
seamlessly.... We're good to go here for a while."</TE>
<TE>   Network news is dealing with what Brokaw called "the big
bang"--new technology, the cable explosion and the "voracious
appetite for news and information on the part of the public."</TE>
<TE>   Newscasts will evolve to find their place in that environment, he
predicted, "although that doesn't mean they will be the same as when
[Chet] Huntley and [David] Brinkley were doing it."</TE>
<TE>   The Stennis special came about when NBC News and Brokaw were
looking for a follow-up to "The Bush White House: Inside the Real
West Wing," a hit with viewers in January, although Aaron Sorkin,
creator of NBC's dramatic hit "The West Wing," charged Brokaw in a
New Yorker interview with going easy on the president, showing him
with a busier schedule than usual.</TE>
<TE>   Sorkin later apologized to Brokaw.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon also has been criticized for allowing selective
access to its Afghanistan operations, largely keeping news reporters
far away while allowing in entertainment producers who want to
profile military personnel, presumably in a more flattering, less
discerning way.</TE>
<TE>   Brokaw noted that NBC News also has reporters trying to get
independent access to the battlefield. "This is just one component to
our coverage," he said, adding, "I think it's a useful exposition
from the point of view of how one of these big ships operates ...
[and] a reminder that there is a war going on."</TE>
<TE>   NBC negotiated with the Navy over access almost to the end, Brokaw
said, and unlike the entertainment specials was not required to get
Pentagon review.</TE>
<TE>   NBC, which used a team of 16 cameras and 40 production people to
document the floating city of more than 5,000 military personnel, had
the free run of the ship, except for its nuclear power operation.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not led around by the nose," he said.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tonight's "Once and Again" carries an important message for its
passionate fans: Life goes on--after divorce, affairs, accidents and,
yes, the cancellation of television shows.</LD>
<LD>   For this, the final episode of the acclaimed but
ratings-challenged series (10 p.m., ABC), does its level best to
serve some chicken soup to those souls who have analyzed its every
nuance on the Internet and organized campaigns to save it, including
a protest planned outside ABC today in Burbank.</LD>
<LD>   In somewhat of a departure from the show's customary pace, which
is just this side of grass growing, the finale presents one
life-altering development after another in its adult characters'
lives. For some, there's the prospect of marriage; for others,
turning points in careers or relationships or both.</LD>
<TE>   Into the last category fall the central figures of Lily (Sela
Ward) and Rick (Billy Campbell), who began the series' third season
in September as newlyweds. Back then, they were trying to unite a
house filled with kids from each of their first marriages. Now,
they're trying to keep the realization of their professional dreams,
the intrusion of "too much good news," from tearing them apart.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, the emotional development of the characters is key, as
is fine acting from an ensemble cast. So often here it takes just one
look, one smile, one furrowed brow to tell much more than the script
or a plot point ever could. But in the effort to tie up loose ends
and suggest what direction the future will take when the series is
dead and gone, some things got trampled.</TE>
<TE>   The children, who formed the crux of many an episode or at least
provided interesting subplots, play little more than background roles
tonight. More important, the confluence of all these dramatic, or
melodramatic, flash points seems contrived, an incongruous end to a
show seeking to reflect upon reality.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the finale does offer closure. Watch the last five
minutes and you'll see that, even if this wasn't everyone's idea of
entertainment or the second coming of "thirtysomething," the show had
a way of touching people's lives.</TE>

<DH>Classic fairy tale gets a proletariat tweaking in the
large-scale Russian production of 'Cinderella,' but retains its
fantasy appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oleg Vinogradov's version of "Cinderella" wants to be a slightly
unconventional retelling of a classic fairy tale, a lyric dance-drama
about people imprisoned by their place in life and a grand-scale
classical showpiece that belongs alongside the story ballets of the
19th century. But it integrates dance and narrative awkwardly, lacks
theatrical magic and never really accounts for the darkness and
sarcasm in Sergei Prokofiev's score.</LD>
<LD>   Originally choreographed in 1964, it joined the repertory of the
Kirov Ballet and during Vinogradov's tenure as that company's
artistic director was scheduled to be seen in the 1995 Kirov season
at the Orange County Performing Arts Center--a season canceled
because of problems earlier on the company's national tour.</LD>
<LD>   Enter the Perm State Ballet, a company with strong links to the
Kirov in training and style. Even before performing the production at
home in Russia, Perm brought this newly restaged "Cinderella" to the
Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts on Saturday, with the
vividness of Stanislav Benediktov's sets and costumes erasing the
memory of the company's antique, threadbare "Giselle" on its first
visit last year.</LD>
<TE>   In outline, Vinogradov's production follows Communist-era
priorities by satirizing Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters as
the dregs of crass, acquisitive, bourgeois society--and by sending
Cinderella and her Prince off to Fantasy Land at the end lest they
return to the palace to head the ruling class. (Both of them decline
a crown during Act 2.)</TE>
<TE>   However, Vinogradov does tweak the standard narrative here and
there. For instance, Cinderella doesn't earn her transformation by an
act of charity; her Fairy Godmother protects her from the very
beginning. And although the Prince carries Cinderella's slipper
around the world, he never asks anyone to try it on but simply holds
it up as a divining rod or homing device. (It's gone before he and
Cinderella are reunited.)</TE>
<TE>   His most sensitive insight is showing the Prince as much stifled
by palace glitter as Cinderella is by fireplace grime--and thus how
they are made for one another. Their mutual need and growing ardor
are reflected in the best of his dances: duets in the second and
third acts full of complex partnering tasks and bravura steps,
especially for her.</TE>
<TE>   Although the title role showcased the exemplary Natalia Moiseeva,
the most memorable dancing at the Saturday matinee came from the
corps: 18 women playing the Fairy Godmother's attendants doing
matched beaten steps with feathery lightness late in Act 1, and 12
men playing the Prince's guards doing quasi-equestrian and military
maneuvers with great flair early in Act 3.</TE>
<TE>   The alarming decline in corps proficiency at American Ballet
Theatre and other U.S. companies may have helped make Perm's
achievement seem so striking. We have fine Cinderellas of our own but
no ensembles like this.</TE>
<TE>   Dancing initially in folk clogs as a symbol of the oppressed
masses, Moiseeva graduated to toe shoes without losing her remarkable
warmth. Suavely partnered by Vitaly Poleschuk, she floated through
every test of balance and tossed off 30 fouettes with rapid changes
of arm positions. A lovely performance.</TE>
<TE>   As the Prince, Poleschuk managed to make Moiseeva look weightless
in every difficult lift but danced unevenly in solo display
passages--at best smooth and clean, but with limited elevation and
occasionally rocky transitions.</TE>
<TE>   The gracious Yulia Mashkina also sometimes looked shaky in the
Godmother's extended Act 1 duties, but Irina Kozyntseva danced the
nasty Stepmother with faultless security. Tatiana Bolshukina (addled,
in red) and Natalia Makina (pouty, in green) played the Stepsisters
effectively, but never made the characters into the very bad dancers
that Vinogradov required.</TE>
<TE>   Unbilled, but a very good dancer: Yana Fedotova in the Spanish
divertissement. Dmitry Durnev bumbled charmingly as the king but
Dmitry Assaulyak and Oleg Posokhin hadn't yet made anything
distinctive out of the finicky character roles of the Tailor and
Dance Master.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Valery Platonov expertly led the company orchestra and the brass,
again, proved a real liability.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Giggles, guffaws, chuckles and chortles abounded Saturday night at
Pepperdine University's Smothers Theatre when the Second Hand
strutted its endearingly oddball brand of movement magic.</LD>
<LD>   The three-man ensemble--co-artistic directors Greg O'Brien and
Andy Horowitz, and newcomer Marlon Torres--is a real crowd pleaser,
especially in the kiddie arena. No matter. Their 70-minute show,
which included four numbers new to the West Coast, definitively
proved that a plethora of props, huge sets or fancy costumes are not
needed for a good act.</LD>
<LD>   Particularly appealing: "Window-7," a premiere set to the music of
Plastic Nebraska in which the stage area was shrunk down to the size
of a 4-by-4-foot site. Talk about a Magritte-like atmosphere! This
so-called window provided the perfect backdrop for somersaults, dives
and leaps.</LD>
<TE>   Another premiere, "The Much," featured Richard Marino's
xylophone-based score, with the men hopping in unison--when they
weren't leaping onto somebody's hands or doing a bit of comic
shoulder shrugging.</TE>
<TE>   Also new: "Viklarbo." Alfred Newman's adagio accompaniment saw an
array of machine-like moves that recalled Charlie Chaplin's film
"Modern Times." Wearing silver unitards, the trio looked like
friendly aliens. "Lonesome Cowboy Bob," the evening's other premiere,
was like Agnes de Mille on acid, with plenty of bouncing in place,
backward leaping and upper-torso wiggling, all set to the tune
"Ragtime Cowboy Joe."</TE>
<TE>   A gaggle of previously reviewed numbers, including "The Weird
Sisters," "Rachmaninov" and "Clackers" completed this lovable, albeit
loony, program.</TE>

<HD>Elevating the Natural</HD>
<DH>Architecture's top honor goes to Glenn Murcutt of
Australia, who blends Modernism with a love of the environment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The architect Glenn Murcutt, a self-employed, independent spirit who
has never worked outside of Australia, has won the Pritzker Prize,
architecture's highest honor.</LD>
<LD>   Murcutt is best known for designing small, rural houses that
combine a Modernist aesthetic with a deep sensitivity to the
environment. Over a 40-year career, he has built a body of work whose
central theme is the desire to heighten our awareness of the natural
landscape--its sounds, smells and climate. His best designs rest on
the landscape with an almost reverential delicacy.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, unlike previous Pritzker Prize recipients, Murcutt has never
completed a major civic building. His largest project to date is the
Arthur and Yvonne Boyd Education Centre--a $1.3-million,
8,690-square-foot research and study facility in Riversdale, New
South Wales, just south of Sydney.</LD>
<TE>   "Getting the prize was a terrible shock," the Sydney-based Murcutt
said during an interview over lunch in Los Angeles. "What is amazing
is that it has gone to someone of my stature. I work with no staff,
no secretary, no computer-aided design. I don't even have a cellular
phone. It is a small operation--just me."</TE>
<TE>   Established by the Hyatt Foundation in 1979, the Pritzker Prize
each year honors a living architect who is judged to have made
"consistent and significant contributions to humanity and the built
environment through the art of architecture." Previous winners
include Richard Meier and Frank O. Gehry of the United States; Rem
Koolhaas of the Netherlands; Renzo Piano of Italy; Kenzo Tange of
Japan; and, last year, the Swiss team of Jacques Herzog and Pierre de
Meuron.</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Silvetti, a Pritzker juror and chairman of Harvard's
graduate school of architecture, said the decision to select Murcutt
reflects an effort to "broaden our perspective, to look beyond
Europe, Japan and America. Architecture can occur at many scales. And
Murcutt is a person who has a healthy obsession with basic
architectural issues--the environment, light, materials, technology.
His work is about going deeper into these issues, rather than trying
to create something novel with each project."</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1936, Murcutt grew up in Upper Watut, New Guinea, where
his father worked as a gold miner. The nearest European settlement
was 10 miles away, and the family lived in a simple wood-frame house
raised on stilts. The experience imbued Murcutt with a heightened
sensitivity to the natural environment, a driving theme in his later
life as an architecture.</TE>
<TE>   "It was extremely wild," Murcutt said of his early home. "And it
could be a very dangerous place to be, with wild pigs and scorpions.
But the nights were cool, and we were surrounded by a field of Kunai
grass, which grow to about 5 feet tall. Beyond that, there was a rain
forest that looked like broccoli."</TE>
<TE>   It was Murcutt's father, an avid architecture fan, who introduced
his young son to the works of earlier Modernists such as Mies van der
Rohe and Charles and Ray Eames. Murcutt also cites a later trip to
Europe as having opened his eyes to Modernism's range, in particular
a visit to Pierre Chareau's 1928 Maison de Verre in Paris. The
house's glass-brick facade and exposed I-beams were muscular
expressions of a unique, industrial aesthetic.</TE>
<TE>   "That house was extremely important to me," he said. "Chareau
showed me that Modern architecture could be open-ended--not just
white buildings with horizontal slots. It was about using the
technology of the day."</TE>
<TE>   What sets Murcutt apart from the early Modernists is that his most
significant works are set in rural areas, far from the buzzing urban
context that was the traditional playground of the avant-garde. As
such, a more relevant precedent may be Chareau's studio for Robert
Motherwell, built in Long Island in 1946 and demolished in 1985. The
studio's long, arched roof, which recalled a Quonset hut, was made of
inexpensive, corrugated metal. Its long, mechanical window allowed
light, air and nature to spill into the space.</TE>
<TE>   Murcutt's Marie Short House, completed in 1975, similarly explores
the relationship between industrial forms and natural landscape, but
with a lighter touch. Built at a bend in the Maria River in a lush
rural setting, the house is raised slightly on short stilts to
protect it from floods and snakes. An enormous, corrugated metal roof
provides shade. The perimeter walls are designed as a system of
adjustable, horizontal louvers to control the flow of air through the
interiors.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the house's structure was made of timber left from a
nearby sawmill. The louvers are made of steel, with a baked enamel
finish. "When the wind is blowing in the summer, it has a wonderful
cooling effect," Murcutt said. "In the winter, the louvers have a
tendency to heat up, and you can warm your back against them in the
mornings."</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, the Magney House, completed in 1984, is a bolder
technological statement. The house's long, low profile is carefully
positioned to take advantage of the northern light. The asymmetrical,
winglike form of the roof--the design's most prominent
feature--allows water to collect into one central gutter. The water
is then recycled for drinking and heating. The exterior walls defy
conventional construction practices, with brick along the interior
and corrugated metal outside, to provide better insulation.</TE>
<TE>   Murcutt's Arthur and Yvonne Boyd Education Centre uses similar
techniques on a larger scale. The structure includes a 180-seat
covered theater, which opens onto terraced outdoor seating. A
lightweight metal roof folds up and down to mimic the slope of the
landscape.</TE>
<TE>   But Murcutt has had less success working in Australia's urban
centers, where he has often been frustrated by government
bureaucracies. In 1993, Murcutt was hired to design a proposal for
major addition to Sydney's Custom's House, on a site overlooking the
harbor.</TE>
<TE>   Murcutt suggested demolishing a series of 1960s additions to the
original structure, a U-shaped stone structure built in the 1870s. A
new glass structure was designed to frame the courtyard's fourth
side, which would house escalators and stairs. The courtyard was
covered by a sawtooth, mechanical roof, which could open on warm
days. Above, enormous reflecting panels would draw light and air into
the space. The panels could be adjusted depending on weather
conditions and the sun's position.</TE>
<TE>   But once the design was complete, the local council asked another
firm to come up with a more traditional counterproposal, and Murcutt
eventually pulled out, refusing to compete.</TE>
<TE>   "My father gave me a healthy disrespect for the government,"
Murcutt said. "The argument against my work is that my buildings
don't 'harmonize' with the natural environment. But I see harmony as
something different--disparate sounds in combination with each other.
What they're asking for is monotony, and I can't tolerate that."</TE>
<TE>   This year's Pritzker Prize ceremony will be at Michelangelo's
Campidoglio in Rome, Italy, on May 29.</TE>

<HD>Marin's Ode to Individuality</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's no point in reviewing Maguy Marin's "Points de Fuite," a
puzzling, complex, 80-minute postmodern abstraction performed at UCLA
on Friday by her 10-dancer Compagnie Maguy Marin.</LD>
<LD>   Obsessed with fugal structures and individual action within a
group, the piece continually recycles a spoken text by poet Charles
Peguy that makes any criticism pointless by insisting that "the stock
of ideas is exhausted," and "everything has been said...."</LD>
<LD>   "For 6,000 years, others have said it before you or haven't said
it or were able to or could have said it," one dancer after another
declares. So it's irrelevant to point out that "Points de Fuite"
co-opts movement ideas and processes developed more than a quarter
century ago by American postmodernists--innovations recently
revisited on this same Royce Hall stage by Mikhail Baryshnikov and
his White Oak Dance Project.</LD>
<TE>   "Ideas are cadavers," Peguy and Marin's dancers emphasize, and, by
implication, the future of human culture and choreography is "purely
a matter of management."</TE>
<TE>   In "Points de Fuite," management begins with dancers in street
clothes executing various structural ploys on a bare stage, each of
them from time to time moving to a microphone for text recitations
and to the assortment of electric guitars and drums at the left to
play a texture-dominated but often assaultive score by Denis
Mariotte.</TE>
<TE>   Running in circles, the dancers introduce new motifs with each
lap: lifts, falls, pulling someone back. Other sequences develop into
chains of gestural acts (heads being shoved down) or gymnastic feats
(women hurled from a moving cluster of bodies) or shifts of position
(dancers flinching and twisting as they lie in a line on the floor).</TE>
<TE>   Ulises Alvarez usually initiates the segments, and at one point
his leadership turns nasty, with Marin having him shove people around
in a weird passage of fugal abuse.</TE>
<TE>   There are no conventional dance steps, and Marin has said that the
piece shuns virtuosity. But a sequence of hopping moves, with the
dancers nearly lying down on their sides but propelling themselves on
their right knees and palms, looks impressive. And their stamina
alone seems virtuosic.</TE>
<TE>   But it's a trap to describe what happens in "Points de Fuite"
because we hear, over and over, that the only important issue is the
human element, "what comes from you." The first text serves as a
warning: "Don't talk to me about what you are saying.... I'm asking
you how you are saying it." So the core of the piece is supposedly
the interaction among dancers, the way each moment of physical
contact becomes an intense relationship event for the participants.</TE>
<TE>   Besides choreographing intimate face-to-face lifts that dramatize
her dancers' closeness as an ensemble, Marin ritualizes their
self-examination and even provides a string of solos that shows them
alternately befuddled, eccentric, inquisitive ("Are you feeling
alive?") or likable. And she brings in 10 more individuals drawn from
the local community as surrogates for the rest of us.</TE>
<TE>   In this sense, the work serves as a metaphor for the set
structures of our lives: the inescapable repetitions of the daily
grind. How we affirm and deepen our individuality within those
structures is what interests Marin most: how intently Marcelo
Sepulveda balances on a rock, for instance, and how tenderly Ennio
Sammarco rescues him from that precarious task.</TE>
<TE>   "Points de Fuite" isn't improvised, however, and when Alvarez
turns into a control freak or Thierry Partaud ends a group run by
becoming too much of a jock and disrupting the formation, we feel
Marin manipulating her dancers into roles: characters who may or may
not be true to life.</TE>
<TE>   Based in Rilleux-la-Pape, near Lyon, Marin is best known locally
for vivid theatrical concepts: her ghostly evocation of characters
from plays by Samuel Beckett ("May B"), a divertissement for dancers
in bodysuits that made them look grotesquely fat--and naked
("Grossland")--and, most of all, a "Cinderella" set in a giant
dollhouse. A profound sense of estrangement has colored all these
works, including a contemporary reinterpretation of "Coppelia," seen
locally only on cable.</TE>
<TE>   Deliberately stark and unadorned, "Pointes de Fuite" is not the
first abstraction by Marin on our stages, but its declaration that
idea-based human achievement has reached a dead-end is a peculiar
stance indeed for a choreographer who has always found ideas about
staging dance more compelling than the act of dancing.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, even her humanism here may well represent just another
staging ploy: reality-based dance in which company members garnish
and freshen dry movement etudes by playacting her fictionalizations
of them.</TE>
<TE>   If so, the result qualifies as "a matter of management that is
more or less well organized," in Peguy's words, but is still
profoundly estranged from the human individuality that it tries to
celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the dancers mentioned, the company includes Preciosa Gil,
Isaias Jauregui, Sylvie Pabiot, Livia Patrizi, Cathy Polo and

<HD>'Lopez' Family Dynamics Not True to Life</HD>

<LD>You always have to root for the homeboy. So on Wednesday, March 27, I
made sure to be home by 8:30 p.m. The premiere of "The George Lopez
Show" was a "must-see TV" event for me. Even though I don't know
Lopez personally, I have friends and do business with Latinos who
have similar backgrounds to his, living half in the Latino world and
half in the non-Latino world. Their perspective on the "situation" is
generally light and often funny, so I was ready to laugh.</LD>
<LD>   I got home about 8:15 and my wife was watching "American Family"
on PBS, so I was relegated to the little TV in the kitchen. Here we
were, watching two "Latino-themed" programs--and with "Resurrection
Boulevard" coming on at 10 p.m. on Showtime, I realized we had made
some progress. Three television shows about three Latino families. We
have Wednesday night. Perhaps we should call it "Must Si TV."</LD>
<LD>   I really liked the opening of "The George Lopez Show." The
characters flying in and out of frame to the beat of a snappy theme
makes a good background for credits. At this point, I did not know
that the credits would end up being my favorite part.</LD>
<TE>   Like any other profession, comedy writing has certain rules. One
of them is, "You've got to have likable characters." That doesn't
mean your characters can't have flaws or make mistakes, but by the
end of the episode the audience has to be at peace with those people.</TE>
<TE>   Take Ray's mother on "Everybody Loves Raymond." No matter how
annoying she is, there is always at least one moment in each episode
where she is "human" and compassionate. We know that if push came to
shove, she would gladly give up her life for those boys and those
grandkids ... although maybe not for the daughter-in-law. On the
other hand, in "The George Lopez Show," his mother is a bitter, angry
woman who constantly puts him down. Whether alone or in front of
others, she doesn't show one iota of compassion. I would not invite
this woman into my home for five minutes, never mind a half-hour.</TE>
<TE>   I've had friends who have messed up their whole lives and done
really, really stupid things. Yet their mothers always believed they
were basically good, misunderstood and innocent of whatever crime
they may have committed. George is a hard-working family man. Why is
his mother so angry?</TE>
<TE>   Not likable. Not funny.</TE>
<TE>   But even more important than that is the No. 1 rule of comedy
writing: "You must be honest." Without that, this one rule, by
itself, can destroy the best-laid story plans. Your characters have
to be honest and your situations have to be true. The family
dynamics, and especially the Latino family dynamics, depicted on "The
George Lopez Show" are not honest.</TE>
<TE>   Being the father of two daughters, ages 16 and 20, I was surprised
at the lack of insight into family life displayed by the writing in
the pilot. George's 13-year-old daughter refuses to wear a bathing
suit and the parents jump to the conclusion that she must have
started her first menstrual cycle. The mother is excited because her
"baby has become a woman." Wrong. Then she wants to call their
friends and announce this "event." Wrong. Wrong. The daughter storms
off and the wife sends George to find out what other personal problem
it could be. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The Latina mothers I know are more apt to break down in tears
because their baby was becoming a woman or deny the event has even
taken place. And as for who would investigate further: In my house, I
would be banished to the TV room and my wife would cordon off the
perimeter around my daughter until the problem was revealed,
researched and remedied.</TE>
<TE>   But on the show, the daughter refuses to discuss her problem with
George for about 10 seconds. Then she tells him that her concern is
unsightly hair.</TE>
<TE>   Oh my gosh. I don't want to sit through this. I don't want to know
when my daughter shaves, and I certainly don't want to know when
George's TV daughter shaves. Where's her mother?</TE>
<TE>   I'm sorry to say the second episode was not much better. And the
third episode's main story line revolved around the fact that
George's mother had never encouraged him to have any aspirations in
life. "That way you'll never be disappointed." Wow.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, I hope "The George Lopez Show" finds its way--for
two reasons. First, if it fails, "they" will surely say, "Latino
sitcoms just don't work," when in fact all we know for certain is
that they broke the first rule of comedy writing. Second, no matter
what, you always have to root for the homeboy.</TE>

<LD>The flowers and the fringe were flying at Santa Monica's
Morgan-Wixson Theatre on Friday when the company Canela Pura (Pure
Cinnamon) presented "Viejos Tiempos." A Fountain Theatre production,
this fierce flamenco concert proved first-class, with sublime
artistry the order of the evening.</LD>
<LD>   Under the artistic direction of singer Antonio de Jerez--whose
soulful vocal chops thrilled to the bone--the husband-wife team of
guitarist Paco Arroyo and dancer Yolanda Arroyo also dazzled with
incomparable technique and style to burn.</LD>
<LD>   In her opening duet, "Cuatro Esquinas," with guest artist
Marcellina de Luna, Yolanda Arroyo, who seems to have written the
book on smoldering, positively oozed staccato bursts of footwork,
while the duo's crisp unison moves also satisfied. De Luna's solo,
"Habanera," cast the dancer as exotic bird, her stellar fan work
sharp and sexy. Also guesting: Valeria Pico, whose swift, syncopated
stomping and arched back gave off whiffs of unbridled sensuality in
her solo, "Las Caracolas."</LD>
<TE>   The company rocked in both "Rescordito" and "Alhambra," with Paco
Arroyo plucking out pizzicato-like motifs in the latter, providing
fine accompaniment as the female triptych let off machine-gun volleys
of hot heel and toe work. Yolanda Arroyo gave new meaning to the word
intoxicating with her solo, "Viejos Tiempos," her feet a blur as she
executed a series of champion half-kicks.</TE>
<TE>   With Scott Tuomey's sumptuous lighting and more fanciful costumes
than one might encounter at an Edith Head retrospective, the night
took passion to new heights. Who says the Westside doesn't know how
to get down?</TE>

<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The brokerage industry may face a flood of legal actions from burned
tech-stock investors, experts say, as a result of a New York state
report alleging that Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analysts recommended
Internet stocks to investors while at the same time privately
scorning them as "junk."</LD>
<LD>   The report's startling allegations are providing what purports to
be a glimpse of the seamy side of the tech-stock boom that swept Wall
Street in the late 1990s, creating billions of dollars in paper
profits that later evaporated as once highly touted stocks plunged in
value.</LD>
<LD>   A 10-month investigation by New York State Atty. Gen. Eliot
Spitzer, an initial report on which was released last week, turned up
e-mails from a Merrill Lynch research team then headed by widely
followed Internet analyst Henry Blodget.</LD>
<TE>   In the e-mails, analysts speak in deprecating--and at times
obscene--terms about stocks that at the time sported the analysts'
highest ratings. The ratings, such as "buy" or "hold," are used by
many investors when deciding whether to own a particular stock.</TE>
<TE>   Among the firms mentioned was Pasadena's GoTo.com, now known as
Overture Services. The report alleges that Merrill skewed its rating
on Overture stock in an effort to win business from the company.
Overture officials said they are cooperating with the attorney
general's investigation and believe they were "a victim of Merrill's
practices," a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   The crux of the report is that Merrill analysts maintained high
ratings on many Internet stocks largely to curry favor with the
companies, in the hope that the firms would award the brokerage
fee-rich stock underwriting business and other banking deals.</TE>
<TE>   The Merrill e-mails "have confirmed what a lot of us have
suspected for many years," said Mark Maddox, an Indianapolis attorney
who represents investors in complaints against their brokers. "The
New York attorney general's office was able to find the smoking gun
evidence of this improper practice by Merrill Lynch."</TE>
<TE>   Merrill has rejected the allegations, saying the e-mails have been
taken out of context and that Spitzer's report did not give the
brokerage an opportunity to defend itself.</TE>
<TE>   But Spitzer's inquiry is spreading: At least six other major
brokerages have received subpoenas, sources say. And that has
securities experts predicting waves of lawsuits on behalf of
investors burned in the meltdown of Internet and telecom stocks over
the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   They also expect a surge in individual damage claims submitted to
the National Assn. of Securities Dealers and the New York Stock
Exchange for arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always nice to have journalists and government people do the
expensive discovery for you," said Henry Hu, a securities law
professor at the University of Texas in Austin.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Maddox referred to the New York probe as "a plaintiff
attorney's dream" and said he personally is reviewing a half-dozen
previously filed claims against Merrill and a dozen other prospective
cases.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to cause a lot more cases to be filed than
otherwise would have been filed, and it's going to make a lot of
cases that were already on file better," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's allegations that analysts hyped stocks to generate
investment banking fees for their firms--and million-dollar bonuses
for themselves--are detailed in a 37-page affidavit he filed in state
Supreme Court last week. Spitzer is seeking to force Merrill to
immediately change how it discloses potential conflicts of interest
to investors, pending a final report on his investigation. A court
hearing is set for Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The affidavit will resonate deeply with millions of small
investors who lost money on tech stocks and may suspect they were
tricked, Hu said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is easy for anyone to understand," he said. "It's not like
Enron--no complexities, no off-balance-sheet partnerships. It seems
to be a clear issue of right and wrong, with an element of greed
layered on top. It certainly plays into a paranoid view of Wall
Street."</TE>
<TE>   Broadening the controversy beyond Merrill Lynch, Jacob Zamansky,
an attorney whose claim against Merrill last year became the basis of
the Spitzer inquiry, filed a new arbitration case with the NYSE last
week. It raises similar conflict-of-interest charges regarding Jack
B. Grubman, a high-profile telecom analyst at Citigroup Inc.'s
Salomon Smith Barney brokerage unit.</TE>
<TE>   The claim says George Zicarelli, 60, a CBS News videotape editor,
lost $455,000 by investing in Global Crossing Ltd., whose plan to
operate a worldwide fiber-optic cable network ended in the nation's
fourth-largest bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Zicarelli, who borrowed heavily to buy Global Crossing stock, was
worried when the stock started falling in late 2000 and insiders
including Chairman Gary Winnick were selling shares, the claim says.
The complaint says Zicarelli's broker persuaded him to buy more
Global Crossing shares by showing him Grubman's research, which urged
investors to be "aggressive buyers" of the "cheap" stock.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing shares, which topped $60 in 1999 and early 2000,
were trading at 8 cents a share Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Zicarelli, who has filed for bankruptcy protection from his
creditors, is seeking to recover his $455,000 plus punitive damages
of $10 million--an amount the claim contends was half of Grubman's
annual salary. Salomon Smith Barney spokesman Dan Noonan declined to
comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Zamansky alleges that Salomon Smith Barney won the job of handling
Global Crossing's initial public stock offering in 1998 largely as a
result of efforts by the influential Grubman. Instead of producing
neutral research, Grubman "was nothing more than a cheerleader," with
his salary dependent on drumming up business, Zamansky says.</TE>
<TE>   Zamansky previously won $400,000 from Merrill in an NYSE
arbitration claim filed on behalf of an investor who blamed steep
losses in shares of InfoSpace Inc. on a "buy" recommendation from
Blodget. Spitzer's affidavit said that even as Blodget's private
e-mails called the stock a "piece of junk," InfoSpace was on
Merrill's "favored 15" list of most-recommended stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Describing himself as "usually pretty cynical" about Wall Street,
UT professor Hu said he was "taken aback a little" when he read the
lengthy affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   "The gap between what was being said privately--unless somehow it
was taken completely out of context--and what was being said publicly
was just so huge," Hu said.</TE>
<TE>   He said it's conceivable that New York authorities could file
criminal charges in the case to send a powerful message to Wall
Street, as the federal government has done in the Enron
document-shredding case involving accounting firm Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a securities analyst, even a 1% chance of being
criminally indicted will affect your behavior profoundly," he said.
"On the other hand, do [prosecutors] really want to use it? Its very
power is such that you'd only use it in the most egregious
circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   A Spitzer spokesman said criminal prosecutions are possible under
New York's Martin Act, which has looser fraud standards than federal
securities laws, but no decision has been made on whether to pursue a
criminal case.</TE>

<HD>Wet Seal CEO Fit for Tough Business</HD>
<DH>Kathy Bronstein's eye for trends has led to solid sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wet Seal Inc. Chief Executive Kathy Bronstein prowls the room,
surveying peasant blouses, ruffled skirts and slinky dresses being
considered for Wet Seal stores this summer. She moves from one piece
to another, fingering material, her face fixed in concentration.
Mostly, she is pleased. But a striped dress doesn't fit in.</LD>
<LD>   "Go away," she says, yanking it from the wall and tossing it on
the floor.</LD>
<LD>   This is, by any definition, a hands-on chief executive, a woman
with a keen sense of style who hurls directives like fast balls.
Those who have worked with her say she's a formidable
leader--confident, determined, demanding.</LD>
<TE>   "She doesn't suffer fools gladly," Wet Seal Chairman Irving
Teitelbaum said.</TE>
<TE>   Such intensity and style sense may be just what is needed, because
Foothill Ranch-based Wet Seal faces challenges maintaining its
momentum in the brutally competitive niche that targets girls and
young women. Though its stock has been surging amid solid sales and
earnings gains as Wet Seal's trendy styles hit the mark with
customers, there are still hurdles ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The retailer is in a race that never ends, trying to stay ahead of
a fashion curve that's constantly shifting. It also is continuing to
expand in a niche where some analysts think there already are too
many stores.</TE>
<TE>   "We typically refer to retail as a zero-sum game," said Elizabeth
Pierce, an analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities, who credits Wet
Seal with deftly leaping ahead of the current "hippy, dippy bohemian"
fashion trend.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody wins when somebody loses," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Such challenges are nothing new for Bronstein. At 50, she is one
of the few women heading a publicly held company--in this case, a
onetime bikini shop that grew to what is now about 570 stores
nationwide. Wet Seal had sales in 2001 of just under $600 million.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to its namesake brand, the company operates Contempo
Casuals and Zutopia stores. Its Arden B. chain was named after
Bronstein's 10-year-old daughter.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, the retailer is in a groove. It recently announced
a 19% jump in fourth-quarter earnings, and its stock, which
repeatedly has been hitting 52-week highs, is up 61% for the year.
The stock closed Friday at $37.87, up $2.31, in Nasdaq trading.</TE>
<TE>   Wet Seal also is in the midst of a major marketing push. It has
begun striking deals with record companies to create videos it can
show first in its stores, and it is relaunching a catalog that will
hit 1.3 million households this summer. It also has just launched a
line of cosmetics.</TE>
<TE>   "The business seems to be on fire," said Brian Tunick, an analyst
with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   But it is tough to keep such fires flaming, he cautions, since Wet
Seal and its competitors--including Charlotte Russe Holdings Inc.,
Bebe Stores Inc. and Forever 21--are at the mercy of some very tough
customers: young shoppers who want trendy clothes at moderate prices.</TE>
<TE>   Further, some competitors have given Wet Seal migraines by selling
their own products at lower prices than Wet Seal sells its own,
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   To compete in this niche, companies must regularly anticipate the
whims of fiercely fickle females and cut their losses quickly if they
blow it.</TE>
<TE>   Bronstein does both, industry insiders say. She is as quick to
make decisions as she is to cut her losses, a woman who snuggles into
bed at night with sales reports to keep track of what's selling.</TE>
<TE>   "She is probably the most proactive retailer I've heard of in
terms of acting upon a suggestion, a piece of advice, news," said
Ilse Metchek, director of the California Fashion Assn. "That's been
the key to her success. Nothing really winds up a dismal failure for
a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Bronstein's standout skill is her ability to spot a trend and
translate it into something shoppers will buy, said those who know
her. She's "the best in the business" at selecting merchandise, said
Steve Schoenholz, owner of Tempted Apparel Inc. in Los Angeles, which
makes clothes for Wet Seal and other companies.</TE>
<TE>   "She's able to predict trends and jump on them," Schoenholz said.
"She's very fast."</TE>
<TE>   She also can be tough to do business with, some in the industry
said.</TE>
<TE>   Because Wet Seal is so tuned in to fashion shifts, it sometimes
tries to backtrack on an order if a style starts to cool, which can
be especially hard on small vendors. But such tactics aren't unusual
in the garment industry, others said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very tough business on the small guy," said one supplier
who asked not to be named. "There's no humanity in it."</TE>
<TE>   "The fashion game is a very volatile business," Wet Seal's
Teitelbaum said. "I think Kathy is as demanding as the best of them."</TE>
<TE>   Some vendors said they cannot talk openly about Wet Seal if they
want the company's business in the future, which most of them do,
especially since Wet Seal seems to be flourishing at the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "[Bronstein] is a tough businesswoman," said one analyst, who
asked not to be named. "You can get away with this when times are
good. They need to do business with her now."</TE>
<TE>   Bronstein said she's tough but fair. "We don't cancel orders
unless terms of the orders have not been adhered to--that is deliver
date, quality and fit."</TE>
<TE>   Moshe Tsabag, a Los Angeles clothing maker who has known Bronstein
for 20 years, said she is "very hard-hitting because she knows
exactly what she wants."</TE>
<TE>   "She's one of the greatest merchants I know in the industry," said
Tsabag, owner of HotKiss Inc. "She knows fabric, color, styles. She
breathes, she eats, this juniors business."</TE>
<TE>   Bronstein says her knack for knowing what will sell stems from
instinct and experience. She also gets plenty of help. Wet Seal
subscribes to at least four trend-predicting services. She regularly
visits Europe to stay plugged in to global trends.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, she and Wet Seal design director Lenny Parrella were
walking in Rome when a young Italian woman strolled past wearing a
shirt crocheted at the wrist and neckline that caught Bronstein's
eye. This year, sweaters with crocheted details were selling briskly
in Wet Seal stores, Parrella said.</TE>
<TE>   Even as a child, Bronstein exuded self-confidence, said her
brother Chris Korge, a Miami attorney who still chuckles at the
memory of his hard-charging sister as a debutante.</TE>
<TE>   "Growing up, she always knew what she wanted and she found a way
to get it," he said. "She was always a high achiever. Always."</TE>
<TE>   The Korge clan was a noisy, happy family that ate dinner together
nightly, precisely at 6 p.m. Their 3,000-square-foot home in Miami
was carefully decorated with ornate touches, unlike the casual
furnishings of homes in the surrounding neighborhood. A maid kept
things tidy.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was one of the first homes I ever saw where things
matched," said Anne Schrott, a longtime friend of Bronstein who met
her when they were high school freshmen. If Bronstein simply had to
vent some anger, she would dump out a dresser drawer, her friend
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bronstein was a smart, serious student who was miffed when she
didn't make cheerleader her junior year, Schrott said. But she wasn't
given to typical teenage angst and didn't seek peer approval. "She
didn't necessarily want to fit in," Schrott said.</TE>
<TE>   Bronstein's career in retail began a quarter of a century ago
after she earned a bachelor's degree in advertising from the
University of Florida in Gainesville. Unable to quickly find work in
her field, she packed up for Philadelphia and landed a job as an
assistant buyer for Deb Shops Inc., a women's specialty clothing
chain.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, she was back in Miami, buying belts for Jordan Marsh
department stores.</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, she moved to California when she got a job buying tops
for clothing store Fashion Conspiracy in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Bronstein immersed herself in a grueling work schedule at home and
on the road, said Kathleen Buckley, her assistant at Fashion
Conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   "Many times I would spend the night at her place and we would work
until we could no longer keep our eyes open," Buckley said. "She can
outlast most people."</TE>
<TE>   Bronstein said she wasn't particularly trying to climb the
corporate ladder.</TE>
<TE>   "I always focused on doing what I enjoyed and being as good as I
could be at it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A growing Wet Seal hired Bronstein as general merchandise manager
in 1985. Seven years later, she was chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   "Kathy stepped up to the plate and, in the main, has hit home
runs," Teitelbaum said. As he sees it, Wet Seal has had three major
shifts in its 40-year history.</TE>
<TE>   The first was its initial public offering in 1990. The second was
five years later when it bought the much larger Contempo Casuals from
Neiman Marcus Group Inc., instantly adding 237 stores to its stable.
The most recent was a management reorganization of the last 18
months, which followed a difficult period for Wet Seal during which
sales stumbled.</TE>
<TE>   The company fell out of step with its customers in 1999 as it
began to build the Arden B. division. While Bronstein concentrated on
the new brand, the company's signature stores floundered. Analysts
grumbled that Wet Seal's casual clothes were too dressy and its
dressy clothes too casual. Bronstein had taken her eye off the ball,
they said.</TE>
<TE>   The tide turned as she beefed up the company's management ranks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the real sea change that has occurred over the last year
or two is that [Bronstein] realized she can't do everything," said
Steven Richter, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.</TE>
<TE>   When Bronstein did go after fresh talent, she wasn't shy about it.
When she found people she wanted, she "chased them all over town,"
she said. She "hounded" Greg Scott, who had helped build the Bebe
brand and whom Bronstein was determined to make Arden B.'s president.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I met him, I handed him an offer letter on the
spot," she said. "I called him constantly on his cell phone." Scott
has since signed on with the company.</TE>
<TE>   In another shift for the company, Wet Seal lately has become more
"shareholder friendly," willing to chat up the stock to investors,
analysts said. After a recent trip to Europe, executives flew into
New York to woo analysts, giving a presentation about Seal TV--the
new in-store videos--and Seal Cosmetics.</TE>
<TE>   Bronstein said she has had little inclination to schmooze much
with Wall Street, or even in her industry. She said she'd rather
spend her time with her daughter. They go to church together, take
tennis lessons and eat at Ruby's Diner.</TE>
<TE>   "We are really good friends," said Bronstein, who is divorced.
"She is my biggest supporter and my biggest fan, of everybody I know.
She always says the nicest things to me."</TE>
<TE>   In November, Bronstein completed a major personal project,
building a home at Newport Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Bronstein sold 426,500 shares of Wet Seal stock last year for
between $10.7 and $11.1 million, records show. It was not immediately
clear what Bronstein netted from the sales.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, Bronstein said she's very happy with her life, and
she gives no thought to retirement. But Schrott is hoping Bronstein
at least will slow down eventually so they can squeeze in "a girls'
weekend" together.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe when she's 80, she'll be able to put a couple things on ice
and relax a bit," Schrott said. "But I don't know."</TE>

<HD>Marketing the State's Virtues to Filmmakers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was the sort of pitch a producer likes to hear: an array of
locations available for filming, cooperation from government
bureaucrats vowing to make shoots go smoothly, even potential tax
breaks as a financial incentive.</LD>
<LD>   It is the kind of marketing that has worked so well for North
Carolina, Vancouver, Australia and the myriad other places throughout
the world that have successfully lured away big chunks of film and TV
production from Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   But at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium last weekend, it was
California making the hard sell on its own turf.</LD>
<TE>   State film officials, representatives from 33 counties and cities
and officials from some of the state's best-known scenic areas
staffed the annual three-day Locations Expo to help persuade the
industry to consider shooting in its own backyard before fleeing to
cheaper locales.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't take it for granted they will shoot here," said Allison
Martin, executive director of the film commission in Imperial County,
where Universal's upcoming "The Scorpion King" was filmed.</TE>
<TE>   State and county officials, who in the past have been criticized
for being slow to react to runaway production, agreed that the stakes
have never been higher. This year Gov. Gray Davis proposed a
wage-based tax credit for productions that stay in California, the
first time a governor has gone that far. California officials also
have been touting incentives such as free use of some state-owned
locations as well as programs that waive permit fees.</TE>
<TE>   State and local film officials are finding it harder than ever to
compete because low-cost locations, especially in Canada and
Australia, have become so appealing to studios seeking to tighten
budgets. Canada's sagging currency has been hovering at about 62
cents to the U.S. dollar. On top of that, Canada and its provinces
provide financial incentives and have successfully developed a
skilled entertainment work force.</TE>
<TE>   Upcoming major films shot in Canada include Paramount Pictures'
"The Sum of All Fears," shot in Montreal, and DreamWorks SKG's Jackie
Chan film "The Tuxedo," which was shot in Toronto. A sequel to the
20th Century Fox action film "X-Men" is scheduled to be shot in
Vancouver, and Paramount's "Timeline" will shoot in Montreal. And
directors Ridley and Tony Scott are involved in building a
state-of-the-art studio on Toronto's waterfront for
Pinewood-Shepperton Studios.</TE>
<TE>   California's competitors were well represented at the Locations
Expo, which is sponsored by the Assn. of Film Commissioners
International. Canada and most of its provinces commanded a large
part of one aisle decorated with miniature maple-leaf pennants.
Australia, whose growing film industry has hosted such film shoots as
"The Matrix" series, had a large booth with the words "Stretch your
dollar further in Australia." Also selling themselves were states
such as Georgia and Oklahoma that recently enacted financial
incentives for film productions.</TE>
<TE>   But California nearly filled the back of the convention center
with booths, many handing out freebies such as packaged coffee from
Santa Barbara and boxes of raisins from Fresno. Even Siskiyou County
and cities as small as Fillmore had booths. Scenic areas such as Big
Bear, Catalina Island and the Safari West wildlife preserve in Santa
Rosa--whose booth featured two young cheetahs--also were represented.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very important industry in the state. We will be very
aggressive to retain it and develop the business here. We acknowledge
there is stepped-up competition by other states and countries," said
California Film Commission Director Karen Constine.</TE>
<TE>   Location manager Bruce Lawhead said he is familiar with most of
the areas exhibiting at the show but comes anyway to say hello to
officials from locations where he's worked in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, he said, he discovers an unfamiliar place that he
can use in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Conspicuously absent were representatives of Los Angeles. The
Entertainment Industry Development Corp., which issues film permits
and promotes local filming in Los Angeles, has said for years that it
doesn't need the show, contending that it promotes poaching of Los
Angeles production. Vice President Morrie Goldman said the EIDC
regularly deals with Hollywood decision makers and doesn't want to
waste $2,400 for a booth.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fading genre. The exhibit floor isn't where decisions are
made. We interact with producers on a day-to-day basis. We don't
think it's a good use of our money and staff to man a booth and hand
out pens," Goldman said.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's somewhat disingenuous to support an organization
that is helping open up film commissions around the world and
training their staffs to attract production. We think it sends the
wrong message to support this trade show," Goldman said.</TE>
<TE>   Maggie Christie, the trade show's executive producer, said the
show has no agenda but is aimed at providing information so producers
can make their own choices.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really too bad about Los Angeles. If some of these small
counties can afford to come here, they can be here," she said.</TE>

<HD>CalPERS Health Costs May Jump</HD>
<DH>Benefits: Possible double-digit increases in premiums could
set pace across the country.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a closely watched decision that could signal significant increases
in health-care costs, a key panel of the California Public Employees'
Retirement System will consider Tuesday whether to recommend
double-digit increases in premiums for its members.</LD>
<LD>   CalPERS has been negotiating with major health-care providers to
mitigate proposed rate increases averaging more than 25%, one of the
sharpest jumps in years.</LD>
<LD>   How CalPERS negotiates the costs sets the pace for employers
across the country and provides an early look at what consumers can
expect to face in rate increases. CalPERS negotiates health benefits
for 1.2 million members and thus is the nation's second-largest buyer
of health insurance after the federal government.</LD>
<TE>   This year CalPERS officials rejected initial bids from health
plans proposing rate increases ranging from 15% to 41%. A second
round of negotiations failed to produce any significant reductions in
the rates, prompting CalPERS to start another around of talks but
also to consider reducing the number of major managed-care plans to
one from three.</TE>
<TE>   That proposal could force 150,000 members to change providers,
although 90% would keep their current physicians.</TE>
<TE>   The move, if approved, would be a short-term cost cutting measure
reflecting the system's long-range goal of contracting with a single
health-care provider, CalPERS spokeswoman Pat Macht said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a recognition that our years of being able to leverage
prices are over, and CalPERS can't bring affordable health care to
its members alone," Macht said. "This is a problem that is endemic to
the state and nation. The back is beginning to break on the
health-care delivery system in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Exactly what the latest negotiated rates might be won't be
unveiled until Tuesday's meeting of the pension fund's health
committee.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the agency faced similar proposed increases, ranging from
5% to 41%, but stuck to raising premiums by 6% only after agreeing to
double members' out-of-pocket costs for office visits and
prescription drugs. With the increases in so-called co-payments, the
actual increase to members' costs was about 13%.</TE>
<TE>   The health committee, which includes seven of the 13 CalPERS board
members, is scheduled to recommend new rates and plan-cutting
proposals Tuesday. The full board, which typically approves the
recommendations, is scheduled to take up the issue on Wednesday.
Still, the panel could elect to postpone the decision and continue
negotiating for better rates, Macht said.</TE>
<TE>   A recent staff report described the initial proposed rates as
being at "an all-time high" compared with CalPERS' view of what it
deemed as justified rate increases. The report, completed by Nancy
Welsh, the agency's chief of the health program development division,
also noted that the members were offered no added services despite
the sharp increase in premium payments.</TE>
<TE>   Any increase is expected to face strong opposition from its
members, including the California State Employees Assn., which
reportedly already has objected to another increase in expenses and
the possibility of cuts in benefits. The union, with 100,000 workers,
demonstrated against last year's rate hikes.</TE>
<TE>   Until last year, CalPERS has been well-known for its ability to
leverage its size in negotiating affordable health care for its
members, composed of public employees, retirees and their families.</TE>
<TE>   But late last year, CalPERS joined the National Coalition on
Health Care, an alliance of big companies and unions that has long
campaigned for a national solution to problems of health-care costs
and access.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS admitted in essence that its ability to control costs,
even as a big buyer, was shrinking, and that a national debate on how
to deal with the problem was needed.</TE>
<TE>   In a report, staff members said they will recommend that the
pension fund consider dropping Kaiser Permanente as a plan option,
saying that Kaiser's proposed rates "are not only disappointingly
high, but also higher than justified target rates."</TE>
<TE>   In a harshly critical report, Welsh said "Kaiser's current
approach appears to be to charge whatever it thinks the market will
bear in order to meet its capital and expansion needs."</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly Kaiser's traditional role as one of CalPERS' lower-cost
plans can no longer be assumed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Welsh said that "for CalPERS, as with health programs all
across the country, there are no easy choices this year."</TE>

<HD>Battle Stirs Over Copyright Laws</HD>
<DH>Electronics: Industries are at odds over Senate bill
requiring safeguards in digital devices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Although they are heavily dependent on each other, the people who
make DVD and CD players and the people who produce DVDs and CDs are
preparing for a showdown.</LD>
<LD>   As consumers switch to digital forms of entertainment, Hollywood
is pushing Congress to pass laws that make it more difficult to copy
movies and music. But consumer-electronics manufacturers warn that
there is no such thing as a perfectly secure system.</LD>
<LD>   The arcane world of copyright law rarely triggers such uproar. But
intense lobbying by Walt Disney Co. and other entertainment
firms--which collectively gave nearly $38 million to politicians in
the last election cycle--has sparked a movement on Capitol Hill to
boost copyright protection.</LD>
<TE>   The studios and record labels fear a day when consumers swap
perfect copies of blockbuster movies online as easily as some now
trade bootlegged music.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) introduced a bill
that would, for the first time, make it a crime for anyone to sell,
create or distribute "digital media devices," such as computers, TV
set-top boxes or DVD players, unless they contain government-approved
technology to thwart unauthorized copying. In effect, the Consumer
Broadband and Digital Television Act would make equipment
manufacturers responsible for safeguarding the content their gear
plays.</TE>
<TE>   The bill faces an uphill battle. But equipment makers, consumer
groups and lawmakers are bracing for a bruising political fight.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a shot across the bow," said Gigi Sohn, co-founder of
Public Knowledge, a Washington watchdog group that follows
intellectual-property issues. "I do not support piracy. But you don't
punish technology to get at bad [consumer] behavior."</TE>
<TE>   At stake are billions of dollars in digital entertainment sales
and the future development of the Internet, cable TV and other
communications networks capable of delivering digital content to
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters and opponents of Hollings' bill agree that getting
Hollywood to put its valuable wares on the Internet could trigger a
wave of spending by encouraging consumers to buy more movies and
music, more robust computers and faster Internet connections.</TE>
<TE>   Already, computer CD recorders have become standard equipment on
new PCs. And DVD players are the fastest-growing consumer electronics
product in history,  with worldwide shipments expected to exceed 35
million this year, according to research firm Cahners In-Stat/MDR in
Newton, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   But consumer groups, equipment makers and other opponents said
that if the Hollings bill passes, consumers who want new digital
entertainment services will need government-approved devices--
ranging from copy-proof MP3 players to car stereos and PCs that will
automatically manage how many times, if any, copy-protected digital
content can be copied.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than finding a workable market solution, an imprudent
[federal] mandate could require millions of dollars in engineering
changes that, in the end, will be passed on to consumers," Rep. Anna
G. Eshoo (D-Atherton) told her colleagues in a letter last week.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America in
Washington, said the industry needs greater protection. He said
piracy saps $3.5 billion from the motion picture industry annually
and discourages studios from releasing more digital content.</TE>
<TE>   "The copyright industry [for entertainment and publishing] is
America's greatest trade asset, providing more than 5% of the
nation's gross domestic product," Valenti said. "The movie industry
alone has a surplus balance of trade with every single country in the
world. No other industry can claim that. It is very important to find
some way to protect these valuable works in this digital age."</TE>
<TE>   Besides imposing a new security standard on electronic equipment,
the Hollings bill would make it unlawful to import software or
hardware without government-approved security features. The
government's anti-piracy standard would be imposed within 18 months
of the bill's passage unless the industry agreed on alternative
anti-piracy technology.</TE>
<TE>   Record companies already are trying out several anti-piracy
technologies to protect music CDs.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, country singer Charley Pride became the first artist
to acknowledge selling a CD with copy-protection technology aimed at
thwarting digital duplication. Music on the disc can be played on CD
players but not on personal computers. Several big record labels,
including Vivendi Universal unit Universal Music Group, also have
embraced copy-protection technology.</TE>
<TE>   Major film studios, meanwhile, have been in talks with computer
and consumer-electronics companies for more than a year to come up
with an industrywide copy-protection standard. Their task is more
difficult because they are seeking an anti-piracy solution that would
secure unprotected television content sent over the air, such as the
hospital drama "ER."</TE>
<TE>   Studio officials met in Menlo Park, Calif., in September with a
number of entertainment and technology officials, including John
Chambers, president of computer networking giant Cisco Systems Inc.
and Valenti. But Hollywood executives said Hollings' bill is needed
to reach an accord.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a reason cases get settled on the courthouse steps:
Without the stimulus of an impending decision by an [independent
arbiter], the parties would go on arguing forever," said Preston
Padden, Disney's executive vice president of government relations.
"We are the people who wanted to get this done yesterday. After all,
it is our movies that are getting pirated."</TE>
<TE>   Silicon Valley companies also are victimized by piracy and lose
about $2.6 billion annually in the U.S. from unauthorized copying of
software, according to the Washington trade group Business Software
Alliance. But the firms said Hollywood's efforts to win greater
copyright protection through legislation are misguided.</TE>
<TE>   "Industry will come up with a much better solution than one
mandated by Congress," said Robert Holleyman, president of the
Business Software Alliance. "If there was a silver bullet that would
defeat piracy, we would be for it. But the Hollings bill is not the
answer."</TE>
<TE>   Because the ubiquitous personal computer has a flexible design
that makes is possible to make exact copies of almost any digital
data without degradation, many technology experts, such as Princeton
University computer science professor Edward W. Felten, believe it is
impossible to develop a mass-market anti-piracy technology that can't
be defeated.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood has been spared the Napster-like, mass-market sharing of
videos that has hit the music industry. That's because only 10
million American households have the high-speed Internet connection
needed to quickly download a feature-length film. Using a standard
dial-up modem, downloading a movie could take as long as a day.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the movie industry faces a growing threat from
Web-based services that let consumers download unauthorized copies of
movies for free. And Valenti, aware of the threat, said he is hopeful
of reaching agreement on a new copy-protection technology in the next
few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not looking for perfection," he said. "But what we are
looking for is [sufficient] copyright protection ... so that we can
offer our products to law-abiding consumers at a fair and reasonable
price."</TE>

<HD>Digital Revolution Taking Place Behind the Scenes</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Broadcasters have been slow to embrace the
technology, but it is being used in production by filmmakers and
advertisers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five years into the digital transformation of television, most
viewers still don't see a change on their screens.</LD>
<LD>   The digital TV revolution is making its mark, though--in movie
theaters, Web sites, office buildings and malls.</LD>
<LD>   The high-definition digital cameras and production equipment that
were supposed to deliver a new generation of TV have quickly found
their way into filmmaking and advertising, despite their slow
adoption by local TV stations. And though relatively few households
have splurged on expensive digital TV monitors and receivers,
millions of consumers will go to theaters this summer to see movies
shot with digital camcorders--many of them built for TV news crews.</LD>
<TE>   The high-definition productions on display will range from "Star
Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones" to film clips of runway
models, which shoppers at shoe and clothing store Kenneth Cole in New
York's Rockefeller Center view on flat-panel screens.</TE>
<TE>   A growing number of TV shows are being produced in high-definition
video too, even though less than 1% of all homes are equipped to view
them.</TE>
<TE>   Many film and video producers would have gone digital even if the
federal government hadn't ordered TV broadcasters to make the leap.
But equipment suppliers say the digital video trend has received an
important boost from the mandate on broadcasters, just as the TV
industry is benefiting from the digital experimentation being done by
others in the video arena.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an issue of critical mass. I'm not sure this would be
happening if not for the digital-TV transition," said Stuart English,
a marketing vice president at Panasonic's broadcasting equipment
division as he stood among an array of digital editing and
distribution equipment at the National Assn. of Broadcasters
convention in Las Vegas last week.</TE>
<TE>   A key new market has been film and television production, in which
high-definition gear is starting to take the place of 16-millimeter
and 35-millimeter film.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to cut costs, TV networks "said to their producers, 'We
would like you to produce more in [high-definition digital] because
there's a cost savings,'" said Bob Kaufmann, owner of Video One Inc.,
a video-equipment rental firm in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   Kaufmann's crew is working on the television pilot "In My
Opinion," a situation comedy being shot in high definition for Warner
Bros.</TE>
<TE>   To the Hollywood production community, he said, the main appeal of
high-definition video is that it can look like film.</TE>
<TE>   William Meurer, owner of Birns &amp; Sawyer, a Hollywood equipment
company, said about 20% of his rental cameras are digital, and
they're the ones in greatest demand.</TE>
<TE>   That demand extends beyond high-definition to conventional digital
cameras such as Canon's XL-1, which was designed for news crews but
has been adopted by such noted filmmakers as Steven Soderbergh.</TE>
<TE>   "The beauty of digital is that it has lowered the barrier to entry
in Hollywood," Meurer said. "At the end of the day, everybody would
rather shoot film except George Lucas. But the reality of people's
lives is, 'Hey, I can get an XL-1 camera, I can get a couple of my
buddies, go to a friend's place and make a film.'"</TE>
<TE>   Digital video equipment made its debut in the mid-1990s, when
companies including Sony, Panasonic and Canon offered digital
versions of the camcorders they sold to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   These cameras promised better quality than analog products and
enabled users to edit footage easily and cheaply on personal
computers.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the Federal Communications Commission ordered commercial
TV stations to begin broadcasting in digital by May 2002. The new
digital broadcasting standard included a range of formats, letting
station owners decide whether to offer richer, more cinematic images
(high definition) or maintain the current picture quality (standard
definition).</TE>
<TE>   The commission's order didn't require stations to produce shows in
digital, just to transmit them that way.</TE>
<TE>   Still, broadcasters couldn't deliver news, sports and other
videotaped programs with better picture quality unless they used
digital cameras and production gear, particularly high-definition
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers started adapting their digital video gear to support
high-definition television and other new TV formats.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Panasonic gradually extended its DVCPro line of
cameras, which were marketed for use by roving television news teams,
to include versions offering enhanced picture quality and, later,
HDTV.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcasters bought standard-definition digital cameras as a
money-saving alternative for their news crews and invested relatively
little on HDTV gear. They were spending $1 million or more per
station to transmit programs in digital, but not the additional
millions required to equip their studios for high definition.</TE>
<TE>   And as the advertising slump deepened last year, the stations'
investments in the technology slowed even further.</TE>
<TE>   "Our sales are down dramatically," said Robert J. Estony,
communications director for Ikegami Electronics, a major supplier of
video cameras. "We sell to networks, and the networks aren't buying."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Tubbs, assistant director of the broadcast division at
Canon USA, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The digital transition at the TV station level ... has been very
slow to occur," Tubbs said. "It makes our business very slow."</TE>
<TE>   Panasonic took a step back 18 months ago to reevaluate its
business strategy.</TE>
<TE>   English said he told his colleagues at the time that "TV is
killing high definition" and that the company should focus on other
outlets for the technology.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Panasonic and other manufacturers found a small but
rapidly growing market among filmmakers, TV studios, commercial
directors and corporations for high-definition equipment. To move
those markets along, companies have customized their products to meet
the different sectors' needs.</TE>
<TE>   A good example is Sony's decision in 2000 to build a
high-definition video camera that captured images 24 times a second,
mimicking the 24 frames of film shot by movie cameras. The move
helped spur interest in high-definition video among filmmakers and TV
production houses.</TE>
<TE>   Panasonic followed suit last year, adapting its
60-frame-per-second high-definition cameras to the slower rate
preferred by filmmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Liao, Panasonic's chief technical officer and president of
Panasonic Technologies, said 60 frames a second is great for
recording sports and other programs that have long been shot on
video.</TE>
<TE>   "What we really didn't appreciate the way we should have is that
cinema quality, which is 24 frames per second ... makes such a big
difference. People are used to things that are captured on film."</TE>

<HD>Top Executives Saw Pay Decline in 2001 as Recession Took
Hold</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN CLENDENNING</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Last year wasn't just bad for big business. It was bad for big
businessmen: Many chief executives at large publicly traded companies
saw their annual pay shrink for the first time in more than a decade.</LD>
<LD>   Top company officers of major corporations still raked in
millions. But the salaries that spiraled ever higher from the early
1990s through 2000 edged up only slightly in 2001 as recession took
hold, compensation experts say.</LD>
<LD>   And there were sharp reductions in the huge year-end bonuses that
business leaders customarily receive, causing a drop in overall cash
compensation. Some bonuses were eliminated altogether because of poor
company performance in a bad economy only made worse by the Sept. 11
attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The compensation picture is emerging in year-end reports that
companies are filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   It's the worst year in recent memory for chief executive
compensation, according to experts who acknowledge that the
executives are still well-rewarded.</TE>
<TE>   "While pay is down, it's not as if pay is low," said Robin
Ferracone, a partner and senior executive compensation consultant
with William M. Mercer Inc. "CEOs aren't wondering where the next
meal is coming from."</TE>
<TE>   Salaries rose slightly but bonuses were reduced 13% at 100 of the
nation's largest companies, meaning that the combined total annual
compensation for chief executives dropped 2.9% in 2001, according to
preliminary results of the annual Wall Street Journal/William M.
Mercer CEO Compensation Survey.</TE>
<TE>   The full survey, to be released in mid-April, is expected to show
similar results. If so, it would be the first decline for CEOs since
the survey began in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Other corporate compensation experts expect steeper declines.
Pearl Meyer &amp; Partners, for example, said cash compensation for
executives at 200 well-known companies dropped 14% on average for
companies that ended their fiscal year by Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl Meyer said average compensation for chief executives came in
at $12.5 million for 2001 after factoring in stock options they
exercised during the year. That's down from $12.7 million for 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Companies in industries particularly hard hit by the recession or
other factors ended up reducing executive compensation the most.</TE>
<TE>   FleetBoston Financial Corp., which wrote off loans in Argentina,
gave Chief Executive Charles Gifford a $992,200 salary, the same as
in 2000. His bonus fell from $4.5million to $2.25 million.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco Systems Inc., among the technology firms that suffered badly
last year, paid Chief Executive John Chambers $268,000, down from
$323,000 a year earlier. He got a $1-million bonus in 2000 but
received no bonus in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Sun Microsystems Inc., another tech giant, gave CEO Scott McNealy
a $100,000 salary and no bonus. In 2000, he was paid $104,000 plus a
$4.7-million bonus.</TE>

<HD>Gemstar to Name a New President</HD>
<DH>Media: Appointment of Jeff Shell would signal a more
active role for News Corp. in managing the Pasadena company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an attempt to improve its credibility on Wall Street and plug a
management void, Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc. is expected as
early as today to name News Corp. executive Jeff Shell as president
and chief operating officer, according to sources close to the
company.</LD>
<LD>   The appointment would be the strongest signal yet that News Corp.,
which last year doubled its stake in Gemstar to 44%, is taking a more
active role in managing the Pasadena-based company, which publishes
TV Guide magazine and produces electronic TV program guides. But it
was unclear how much authority News Corp. would have over Gemstar's
management, which is led by founder and Chief Executive Henry Yuen,
who also controls the board. Sources said Yuen has approved Shell's
appointment.</LD>
<LD>   Shell has been a top executive at News Corp. since 1994, most
recently overseeing the group that distributes the company's cable
networks, including FX, two dozen regional sports networks, National
Geographic and the Speed Channel, formerly Speedvision.</LD>
<TE>   Sources say News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch is angered by the
poor performance of Gemstar, whose value has plummeted by 90% since
2000, when the media mogul merged his TV Guide into the Pasadena
company. Murdoch's goal was to create the dominant TV navigational
portal by combining the marquee magazine name with an on-screen
guide.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Gemstar stock closed at $10.54 on Nasdaq, up 62 cents.</TE>
<TE>   The move to bring in Shell was said to be prompted by recent
disclosures by Gemstar of aggressive accounting practices that have
provoked a dozen class-action shareholder lawsuits and an
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition,
News Corp. was forced to take a $2-billion write-off last month on
its investment in Gemstar because of the steep decline in value.</TE>
<TE>   And some analysts say News Corp. could be forced to take another
charge because of the accounting disclosures.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar's stock has slipped steadily amid court challenges to its
dozens of patents covering electronic TV guides and falling
confidence in Yuen and his management team.</TE>
<TE>   Although Yuen is considered a brilliant inventor, he lacks
management acumen to step into the void left by a series of executive
departures. Co-Chief Operating Officers Peter Boylan and Joe Kiener
were swept out in the last year, leaving Yuen and Chief Financial
Officer Elsie Leung, who also became chief operating officer, to run
the company.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the restructuring, Leung would relinquish her title as
operating chief and become co-president alongside Shell, as well as
retain her CFO title, according to the sources. Shell would become
sole operating chief, sources say.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar has lost a third of its value since April 1, when it
disclosed that it reported about $80million in revenue last year that
it had not collected. Gemstar recorded revenue that came from
advertising swaps and licensing fees it hoped to collect through a
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The pain for Murdoch is that much greater because of his increased
exposure in Gemstar. Last year, he swapped News Corp. shares for
Liberty Media's 22% of Gemstar to add the combined interest to a new
company, Sky Global, hoping that the bulkier value would improve his
chances of buying DirecTV from Hughes Electronics Corp. News Corp.
lost its bid for DirecTV to rival Echostar Communications Corp.</TE>
<TE>   One analyst on Sunday viewed Shell's addition as a positive
development, but some insiders say that Murdoch will have difficulty
asserting management authority in the face of Yuen's control.</TE>
<TE>   Although News Corp. controls six of the 12 seats on the Gemstar
board, Yuen, who governs the other half, has ultimate power because
of his ability to break any tie vote.Sources say Yuen and Leung would
continue to have a lock on the purse strings of the company, which
could make it difficult for Shell to have any impact. While Shell
would oversee operations, the finance group would continue to report
to Leung.</TE>
<TE>   Shell, a respected executive who cleaned up the financial
structure of News Corp.'s cable group since taking charge two years
ago, has several challenges at Gemstar. Aside from restoring Wall
Street confidence, he must revive TV Guide, whose circulation is
falling. It still reaches 7 million subscribers but is viewed by many
as irrelevant in the 100-channel universe.</TE>
<TE>   Many on Wall Street also have become disenchanted with the
potential for electronic guides to become an advertising powerhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to Gemstar say Shell is expected to start at Gemstar
today. News Corp. is not expected to name his successor immediately.</TE>

<HD>Kmart Seeks Increased Pay for CEO</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp. has asked a federal bankruptcy judge to approve a
$1.5-million annual base salary, higher than a previous request, for
Chairman and Chief Executive James Adamson.</LD>
<LD>   The salary proposal was filed Friday evening in a motion with the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern
Division. Kmart's attorneys plan to present the revised proposal on
April 23 or April 24.</LD>
<LD>   In the motion, Troy, Mich.-based Kmart said the amended employment
agreement was negotiated by the company and Adamson and called the
terms of the amended agreement "reasonable and appropriate under the
circumstances."</LD>
<TE>   Kmart said the terms are necessary to induce Adamson to serve as
CEO through the company's reorganization proceedings. The company
called Adamson "the best candidate" to serve as its CEO.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart filed for voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Jan.
22 after weak holiday sales and brutal competition from rivals left
it strapped for cash. Kmart, the No.7 U.S. retail chain based on 2001
sales, is the largest U.S. retailer to ever seek protection from
creditors. Adamson was named chairman Jan. 17.</TE>
<TE>   In an April 3 filing, Kmart sought U.S. bankruptcy court approval
to pay Adamson $1 million in salary and an additional $4 million if
the discount retailer emerges from bankruptcy before July 2003. The
amended plan filed in court late Friday would bring Adamson's base
salary to $1.5 million, retroactive to March 11, when he became CEO
after the resignation of Chuck Conaway.</TE>
<TE>   Adamson, a turnaround specialist, has been a Kmart board member
since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   In the motion, Kmart also said that Adamson shall be eligible for
an annual bonus, and that the target bonus shall be 125% of his base
salary at the time the bonus is given. Adamson can be paid more or
less than that target bonus depending on the level of achievement of
performance goals, the motion said.</TE>

<LD>Flood of Earnings Reports Is Expected</LD>
<LD>   A tidal wave of earnings reports will flow this week from
household names and some of the bluest of the blue chips: fast-food
chain McDonald's Corp., financial services bellwether Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co., auto makers General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., and
computer sector giants IBM Corp., Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp.
(See accompanying chart).</LD>
<LD>   Investors also will sift through a slew of reports on the U.S.
economy. These include data on business inventories, consumer prices,
housing starts, industrial production, international trade and weekly
unemployment statistics, as well as the leading economic indicators,
a key forecasting gauge.</LD>
<TE>   "We will continue to get data pointing to economic recovery. We
need corporate [earnings] numbers to show the same," said Michael
Kayes, chief investment officer of Eastover Capital Management, which
oversees $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   This week's economic reports:</TE>
<TE>   * Today, the National Assn. of Home Builders is scheduled to issue
its index for April, which measures the sentiments of home builders
about home sales and home buyer traffic.</TE>
<TE>   * Tuesday, the Commerce Department reports on housing starts for
March, which are expected to slow to an annualized figure of 1.686
million from 1.769 million in February.</TE>
<TE>   Also, industrial production numbers for March, which are expected
to support recent data suggesting a mild rebound in that key sector,
will be released.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the Labor Department will report the consumer price index
for March, expected to be up 0.5%, after February's gain of 0.2%,
according to economists polled by Reuters. Excluding volatile food
and energy prices, the March core CPI is seen up 0.2% after rising
0.3% in February.</TE>
<TE>   * Wednesday, the Commerce Department discloses the U.S. trade
deficit in goods and services for February. It probably widened to
$29 billion from $28.5 billion in January.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will testify on the
U.S. economy and monetary policy to the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   * Thursday, Wall Street will watch for the March index of leading
economic indicators, which economists expect to rise 0.3% after a
flat February reading.</TE>

<TE>   State Lawmakers to Urge Restrictions for Auditors</TE>
<TE>   Corporations would be required to change auditing firms every four
years under legislation expected to be proposed today by California
lawmakers in response to the Enron and Andersen accounting scandals.</TE>
<TE>   The measures also would restrict consulting work by auditing
firms. Critics say the firms' dual role as consultants can create
conflicts of interest for auditors, which are supposed to maintain
their objectivity.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers touted their bills as consumer protection legislation
needed to restore investor confidence. They said California investors
need better information and protections to make wise decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the proposed bills are unnecessary or should be handled
nationally instead of creating piecemeal regulations in 50 states,
said Mike Ueltzen, past president of the California Society of
Certified Public Accountants.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Lou Correa (D-Anaheim) said that California can be a
national leader. It's not uncommon for businesses to face both state
and federal rules, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other proposed legislation would require accountants to keep audit
working papers for seven years, and bar accountants from taking jobs
with former clients for two years after leaving their accounting
firms. The restrictions would apply only to auditors registered in
California.</TE>

<TE>   McDonald's to Report on Social Responsibility</TE>
<TE>   Stung by unfavorable attention it has attracted as a symbol of
rampant globalization, McDonald's Corp. is touting its record of
promoting animal welfare, protecting tropical rain forests and hiring
disadvantaged workers.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the world's largest fast-food chain plans to issue a
45-page document on a broad range of issues, including relationships
with employees, suppliers, the environment and local communities in
the 121 countries where it operates.</TE>
<TE>   The report provides a detailed look at McDonald's 50-year history
of social responsibility, with topics ranging from fair wage
practices to job training and education, transportation and community
outreach such as its Ronald McDonald House charities.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand that people have questions about the brand, and we
have an obligation to talk about the business in a much broader way
than just how much money we're making," Chief Executive Jack
Greenberg told Reuters. "I think we recognize this obligation of
being more open and more transparent about issues that are of
increasing importance."</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's has faced
lawsuits from vegetarians charging it failed to report its use of
beef extracts in its french fries, a federal investigation
surrounding a promotional contractor that is accused of bilking
customers out of millions in prize winnings, and concern over beef
safety abroad, where sales in Europe and Japan have suffered amid
cases of "mad cow" disease.</TE>
<TE>   Greenberg said he hopes the report will serve as a benchmark
against which McDonald's will measure itself in similar periodic
audits. Available on the Internet this morning at
www.mcdonalds.com/corporate/social, the report was prepared using
guidelines provided by Global Reporting Initiative, a Boston-based
group developing international standards for social reporting.</TE>

<TE>   Bombardier Says It Won't Revise Wage Offer</TE>
<TE>   Bombardier Inc., the world's third-largest civil aircraft maker,
said it was not revising the wage offer rejected by about 8,000
workers at its Montreal-area plants who plan to paralyze jet
production with a strike set for today.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with Local 712 of the International Assn. of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers, which represents the Bombardier aerospace
employees in Montreal, said the strike is set to begin with the first
production shift this morning.</TE>
<TE>   One of Canada's largest industrial groups, Bombardier is the
world's leading maker of regional jets and the global No.1 maker of
passenger trains. Most of its profit comes from its aerospace
division, mainly because of the popularity of its regional jet
family.</TE>
<TE>   It also manufactures snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles and
personal watercraft.</TE>
<TE>   A strike over higher wages and retirement provisions would shut
down production of the Canadair Regional Jets of 50, 70 and 90 seats
at the three plants affected. Production of the Challenger business
jet also would be halted.</TE>

<TE>   IMF to Issue Outlook for Global Economy</TE>
<TE>   Prospects for the world economy appeared bleak after Sept. 11. The
situation has brightened, given a surprisingly strong U.S. rebound.</TE>
<TE>   The International Monetary Fund will release an updated "World
Economic Outlook" on Thursday that will serve as the basis for
discussions among finance officials at their weekend meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Mussa, who for a decade was the IMF's chief economist,
agrees that prospects have improved after last year's global
slowdown, the most severe in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "The world economy will see a significant recovery of growth in
2002 and 2003," he forecasts. But he warns this outlook could be
derailed by "a major terrorist outrage on the scale of Sept. 11" or a
sustained jump in oil prices caused by Mideast tensions.</TE>
<TE>   Barring such calamity, Mussa predicts a global growth rate of
2.75% this year, and 4.5% in 2003.</TE>

<TE>   Daily New York Sun to Hit Newsstands</TE>
<TE>   The first new daily paper in New York in nearly two decades hits
stands this week, bidding for a slice of the city's readership amid
the worst advertising recession since World War II.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Sun, to be sold starting Tuesday in over 4,000
locations in all five boroughs, revives the name and slogan--"It
Shines for All"--of a paper that was founded in 1833 and folded in
1950.</TE>
<TE>   The original Sun was considered the first mass daily that changed
the face of the American press with its mix of more fast-paced
general news and its price of only one penny.</TE>
<TE>   The new Sun will carry a price of 50 cents to compete with the
city's most widely read tabloids, but contain content to woo readers
of the most respected dailies.</TE>
<TE>   However, concerns about ad spending have inevitably raised
questions about the Sun's future.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the odds, the new Sun is being backed by a group of U.S.
investors and Canada-born press baron Conrad Black, who seem
confident there is still room for one more daily in the most
competitive newspaper market in the world.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I recently joined a medium-sized company as a full-time,
salaried employee.</LD>
<LD>   When employees are away from the office during a work day on
personal matters, the company requires us to provide a note or a
receipt as proof of where we were.</LD>
<LD>   For example, if I were late for work because I had car trouble, I
would be required to show a receipt from the towing company.
Otherwise, my absence would be considered unexcused, and after a
certain number of these absences, I could be subject to disciplinary
action.</LD>
<TE>   I and many co-workers find this policy to be paternalistic at best
and an invasion of privacy at worst.</TE>
<TE>   Is my employer legally entitled to know the specifics of my
medical appointments, errands and responsibilities outside of work?</TE>
<TE>   --S.M., Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Yes, if you must miss work to attend to them. Employers
have a legitimate interest in ensuring that employees attend work
regularly and that absences be kept to a minimum. Your employer's
policy seems to be an effective means of doing so.</TE>
<TE>   The only legal restriction on your employer's policy is that
employees who are eligible for coverage under the Family and Medical
Leave Act may not be terminated for having too many absences that
relate to covered medical conditions. But the act permits employers
to require employees to provide medical documentation of absences.</TE>
<TE>   Also, although your employer does not need to know (and probably
does not want to know) the specific reasons for doctor visits or the
treatment you received, your employer is entitled to receive
confirmation that you had a medical appointment that caused you to
miss work.</TE>

<TE>   Employer Sets Exempt Worker's Schedule</TE>
<TE>   Q: I am a professional, salaried employee whose time is billed to
clients. I am expected to work during lunch and after hours,
including weekends, as needed, without receiving overtime pay.</TE>
<TE>   Yet my employer insists I report to work by 8:30 a.m. each
morning, and stay at my desk until 5:30 p.m. each night. If I am late
to work or leave early, can I legally be penalized?</TE>
<TE>   --D.W., Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   A: As an exempt, professional employee, you are entitled to be
paid a salary that does not vary with the quantity or quality of the
work you perform. You are not entitled to overtime pay when you work
more than eight hours in a day or 40 hours in a week.</TE>
<TE>   By the same token, your salary cannot be docked or reduced if you
arrive for work late or leave early.</TE>
<TE>   But the law permits employers to set an exempt employee's work
schedule. Thus, although your employer cannot dock your pay, your
employer can legally discipline you, or even fire you, for tardiness
or for leaving work early.</TE>

<TE>   Bonuses Can Come in Cash or 401(k)</TE>
<TE>   Q: My former employer was in the habit of giving a cash bonus at
the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, however, I received part of my bonus in cash, while the
rest was deposited into a new profit-sharing program.</TE>
<TE>   I was not consulted about the distribution.</TE>
<TE>   After being laid off because of the slow economy, I was told that
my money in the profit-sharing program is subject to the same vesting
schedule as employer 401(k) contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Can the company legally subject my bonus to a vesting schedule?
The letter the company gave me explaining the bonus distribution
plainly stated the full amount as my bonus.</TE>
<TE>   --L.V., Costa Mesa</TE>
<TE>   A: Your employer has the discretion to pay the bonus directly to
you or contribute it to a tax-qualified retirement plan on your
behalf.</TE>
<TE>   There is no requirement that bonuses be paid in cash to employees
or that the employer consult with the employees to determine their
preferences.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, contributions for the profit-sharing program can be
subject to the same vesting schedule as matching employer
contributions to your Section 401(k) plan.</TE>

<TE>   Rights to Overtime Pay Can't Be Signed Away</TE>
<TE>   Q: I just joined a consulting firm that agreed to pay me so much
per hour for all hours worked.</TE>
<TE>   Did I sign away my rights to overtime pay by signing that
agreement?</TE>
<TE>   --P.S., Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   A: No one can sign away the right to receive overtime
compensation. If you were entitled to overtime compensation before
you signed the agreement, you still are.</TE>

<HD>Big-Name Stock Losses Obscure Market Gainers</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stock market, as measured by popular indexes, has fallen for four
straight weeks, the longest losing streak in a year. Big-name issues
such as IBM Corp. and General Electric Co. are trading at their
lowest levels since at least October.</LD>
<LD>   But under the surface, the market doesn't look nearly as bad as
the indexes might suggest, analysts said. And that is dispelling some
concerns that the 2000-01 downtrend has resumed.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1% and the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite was off 0.8%, bringing their
four-week declines to 4.7% and 6%, respectively.</LD>
<TE>   By contrast, the S&amp;P small-stock index jumped 3.5% last week and
the S&amp;P mid-size stock index gained 2.2%.</TE>
<TE>   On the Nasdaq market overall, rising stocks outnumbered losers by
2,190 to 1,818 for the week, even as the Nasdaq composite declined.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street's recent trend is reinforcing the pattern of the last
two years: Many stocks continue to do well, but some of the biggest
names, and the technology and telecom sectors, are dragging the major
indexes down.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the mirror image of 1999, when the S&amp;P 500 headed higher
because of the effects of tech and telecom but the majority of stocks
were trending downward," said Sam Stovall, investment strategist at
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   For investors with diversified portfolios, this market arguably is
healthier in that there are more sectors in which to find winning
stocks:</TE>
<TE>   * Over the last month, stock sectors such as real estate
investment trusts, defense, household products, gold mining,
hospitals, insurance and banks have advanced strongly, even as the
Nasdaq computer-stock index has fallen 9.3% and the Nasdaq telecom
index has slumped 14.7%.</TE>
<TE>   * Of the industry groups in the S&amp;P 1,500 composite index (which
is composed of S&amp;P's small-, mid- and large-cap indexes), 81 of 114,
or 71%, are in the black year to date, Stovall said.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that the "market," as many people know it and own
it, is dominated by big stocks: The S&amp;P 500, for example, accounts
for about 90% of the market capitalization of the S&amp;P 1,500.</TE>
<TE>   In the mutual fund industry, funds that own big-name "growth"
stocks hold about $357 billion in investors' assets, according to
Lipper Inc. Those funds have fallen 7.1% this year, on average.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, funds that own small "value" stocks, which hold about
$66 billion in assets, have surged 9.7% this year, on average.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, investors who haven't diversified their portfolios to
include shares other than blue chips and technology may not be
participating in the broader market's strength.</TE>
<TE>   Stovall believes that several factors continue to favor smaller
stocks over blue chips: history, because smaller names tend to
outperform coming out of a recession; valuations, because
small-company stock prices, overall, still are lower than big-company
stock prices relative to earnings prospects; and sentiment, because
many investors' concerns about accounting issues make them most wary
of larger companies, which typically have more complex finances.</TE>
<TE>   Mutual fund managers who have been in the market's sweet spot with
smaller stocks over the last two years are at least guardedly
optimistic about their continuing prospects.</TE>
<TE>   Warren Isabelle, manager of the ICM/Isabelle Small Cap Value fund
in Boston, noted that his fund is up 16.2% year to date partly
because of his bet last fall on economically cyclical companies such
as specialty chemical makers and aluminum fabricators.</TE>
<TE>   "This looks like a textbook kind of a turnaround, a classic
recession recovery scenario," Isabelle said. "Companies with high
fixed costs get crushed at the bottom of an economic cycle, but they
pay down debt and get lean and mean, giving them the operating
leverage to recover strongly when things turn around."</TE>
<TE>   Isabelle said many of his holdings fit that bill, such as chemical
makers PolyOne Corp. and Commonwealth Industries Inc. and aluminum
producer Crompton Corp.</TE>
<TE>   These stocks have recovered sharply from their depressed September
levels in anticipation of a business pickup, Isabelle said, and they
could continue to gain if earnings improve in the second half of 2002
along with the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the economy remains a major question mark for stocks of all
sizes and sectors, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts will be watching closely this week as many companies
report first-quarter earnings, and, Isabelle said, April business
orders also will be important to watch for signs of sustained demand
across the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is whether company managers have just been making
readjustments to their inventories or whether they are gearing up"
for sustained strength in the economy, he said. "I have to keep
looking out of the corner of my eye, because there have been so many
false signals in this market."</TE>
<TE>   Jon Burnham, manager of the Burnham Fund in New York, which
focuses on large-cap stocks, also is cautious in his optimism.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that despite the S&amp;P 500's losses this year, many
"old-economy" blue chips are doing well, such as General Dynamics
Corp., up 18.8% year to date; Procter &amp; Gamble Co., up 16.2%;
Coca-Cola Co., up 13.2%; and Caterpillar Inc., up 11%.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy is improving and I'm still optimistic, but there's a
mind-set out there that is very doubtful about everything, a general
malaise," said Burnham, whose fund is off 2.6% year to date.</TE>
<TE>   The blowup of Enron Corp. has hurt mega-cap stocks such as IBM and
GE as their accounting has come under scrutiny from nervous
investors, Burnham said. And now, major brokerages such as Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. face the threat of legal action including investor
lawsuits stemming from alleged conflicts of interest involving their
analysts, he said.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the Middle East situation remains a potential threat
to the global economy and markets, Burnham said.</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side for stocks in general, oil prices pulled back
sharply last week, and long-term Treasury bond yields have fallen to
their lowest levels in more than five weeks, analysts said.</TE>

<HD>Hitachi to Start Selling Flat-Screen TVs in U.S.</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Electronics maker Hitachi Ltd. plans to start selling flat-screen
televisions in the U.S. later this month ahead of South Korean
rivals, Nikkei English News said, citing unnamed company officials.</LD>
<LD>   Tokyo-based Hitachi aims to sell about 10,000 sets with 32-inch
and 42-inch flat screens in the U.S. by the end of next spring, the
Nikkei said. The screens for U.S.-bound TVs initially will be made by
Hitachi in Japan, with production shifted to company plants in Mexico
later this year.</LD>
<LD>   Sharp Corp., Japan's largest maker of liquid-crystal displays,
plans to more than triple its U.S. sales of such flat-screen TVs to
200,000 in its current fiscal year, the report said. Sharp has begun
selling 30-inch TVs in the U.S., in addition to 13- to 20-inch
models.</LD>

<HD>Witness May Hurt States' Microsoft Case</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine states' quest for tough antitrust restrictions on Microsoft
Corp. suffered a serious blow when an economist didn't endorse their
bid for a stripped-down version of the Windows operating system,
experts say.</LD>
<LD>   Economist Carl Shapiro, the states' final witness, will complete
his testimony as court hearings enter their fifth week. The No.1
software maker will present testimony supporting a settlement it
negotiated to end a 4-year-old antitrust suit by the U.S. government.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses this week will include economist Kevin Murphy, the
company said.</LD>
<TE>   Shapiro, a University of California professor, said the accord
does little more than bar Microsoft from repeating illegal actions.
He backed other antitrust remedies offered by the states, but his
reluctance to endorse their demand for a version of Windows from
which computer makers could remove programs such as Explorer hurt the
states' case, experts say.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Metrocall Inc. plans to fire 495 workers and file for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection from creditors later this month, the
second-largest U.S. paging-services provider said in a regulatory
filing.</LD>
<LD>   Alexandria, Va.-based Metrocall had a loss of $612.8 million in
2001, the company's annual report filed Friday with the Securities
and Exchange Commission said. In all, Metrocall said it will fire
about 850 of its 2,976 workers this year, or about 29%, and close an
undisclosed number of its 30 stores.</LD>
<LD>   Metrocall, which serves about 5.4 million customers, is the latest
victim in an industry losing customers to cell phones and other
devices. One-way pager users in the U.S. fell to about 30 million at
the end of 2001 from about 50 million in 1998, the Cellular
Telecommunications &amp; Internet Assn. said.</LD>

<HD>Fix for Security Delays Might Be Close at Hand</HD>
<DH>Travel: Fingerprints digitalized on identification cards or
passports can be verified in a second, decreasing the wait at
checkpoints, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL CONLON</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The need to positively prove identity in the world left changed by
Sept. 11 is driving technology designed to help people clear security
checkpoints at airports and elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   One of the methods to which experts have turned also is one of the
oldest--the fingerprint.</LD>
<LD>   Giesecke &amp; Devrient, a German firm, recently unveiled a "smart"
identity card that will contain two of the owner's digitalized
fingerprints on an embedded chip.</LD>
<TE>   The company has been hired to use the technology to give the
entire population of Macao--540,000 people--counterfeit-proof
identity cards that will speed up processing at border points in the
territory on the southeast coast of China.</TE>
<TE>   The firm also says it has a contract with Egypt to provide a
comprehensive identity system for each of that nation's 42 million
citizens older than 16.</TE>
<TE>   A Swedish company, Fingerprint Cards, recently announced that its
technology, which allows fingerprint information to be incorporated
in a bar code, will be used in a system being developed for airline
check-in and boarding.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, documents as familiar as the passport also are
undergoing changes. U.S. passports are being made with digital photos
that are embedded into the paper itself, making it virtually
impossible to switch one photo for another.</TE>
<TE>   The British government recently announced it was considering
adding a smart card to British passports. It would include such
things as fingerprints and iris scans, which use the eye as a
positive method of identification.</TE>
<TE>   The concept of a national identity card is still controversial in
some countries.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has said he does not back one for the United
States, but efforts are underway to use fingerprints and other
information on state driver's licenses, which could have the effect
of creating a de facto national identity card.</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons fingerprints are in the fore is that, when
digitalized, they can be verified very quickly, in less than a
second, said Winnie Ahn, marketing specialist for SecuGen Corp., a
biometric technology vendor based in Milpitas, Calif. Fingerprints
also have been long known to be unique identifiers, and the
technology employing them the most mature, making it relatively cheap
for widespread use, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ahn said digitalization allows fine data points and spatial
aspects of a print to be recognized, so that the complete print with
all its curves and whorls does not have to be stored. She said
fingerprints are used in more than 40% of biometric identification
systems.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone can be fingerprinted. In cases where skin is worn
smooth or calloused, identification can be difficult.</TE>
<TE>   People in those situations will require supplemental information
on identification cards or other systems, she said.</TE>
<TE>   There is continuing demand among business travelers for some way
to speed up processing for those who pass through airport checkpoints
most frequently.</TE>
<TE>   The National Business Travel Assn. said its recent survey of 200
corporate travel managers found that two of every three favored some
sort of "trusted traveler" identification system that would make
moving through airport security as fast as before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In a similar survey in January only half of those questioned
thought business travelers deserved such favored treatment.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the survey found that 40% of those contacted
were considering reducing the number of out-of-town meetings if
security processes continue to slow travelers, and 56% said they
might make more conference calls for the same reason.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of the travel managers surveyed said, however, that a
strong economy, and not improvements in security technology, is the
most important factor that will push business travel back to
pre-recession levels.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, 35% said they expected it to be nine months to a
year before business travel recovers to levels of two years ago; 25%
said they thought it would be six to nine months.</TE>

<DH>Asia Global Crossing is speeding up its plans amid turmoil.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The collapse of its majority owner has left Asia Global Crossing Ltd.
scrambling to find new sources of financing and to speed up a
business plan aimed at connecting Asian countries with a single
fiber-optic system and providing data networking services.</LD>
<LD>   Asia Global was expecting a $400-million cash infusion from Global
Crossing Ltd., which owns 59% of the Beverly Hills company. But
Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late January,
putting the subsidiary in a financial bind. Asia Global was counting
on the funds to help it move from a network builder to a provider of
data services over the lines it owns or leases.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the company acknowledged that it is talking with 19
investors, which reportedly include a group of four companies ready
to invest at least $250 million for a controlling stake in the
company. And billionaire Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.,
already a shareholder, said it may make a bid for the cash-strapped
operator of undersea communications cables.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Asia Global expects a "material loss" for the fourth
quarter. It delayed the release of fourth-quarter results as it
assesses the effect of $232.6 million in devalued assets and federal
investigations into the accounting practices of Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the company struggles financially, Asia Global executives
are hiring 100 salespeople and 50 engineers in Asia to help transform
the existing staff of 450 into a provider of communications products
ranging from private lines and Internet access to sophisticated
systems such as virtual private networks, or VPNs.</TE>
<TE>   It operates a U.S.-to-Japan cable and has nearly completed a
system connecting Asian countries from Korea to Singapore, partly
through lines it acquired in swaps of capacity with other carriers.
In such swaps, Asia Global used excess capacity on its cable instead
of cash to buy space--called indefeasible rights of use, or IRU--on
other cable systems.</TE>
<TE>   Such IRU swaps are at the heart of the investigation into Global
Crossing, which was accused by a former executive of improperly
boosting revenue by failing to report accurately the expense of
acquiring the IRUs.</TE>
<TE>   Asia Global's chief financial officer, Stefan Riesenfeld, says the
subsidiary has followed generally accepted accounting practices in
recording IRU swaps. But for now, he and other executives are busy
shoring up the company's prospects, distancing it from Global
Crossing and insisting that it can survive without its parent
company.</TE>
<TE>   Question: How far along are you in talks with potential investors?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: We've sent out information on a nondisclosure basis to a
significant number of people who were interested in understanding
more about Asia Global Crossing. The level of discussion obviously
varies across that spectrum. And at this stage it's probably not
appropriate to comment on exactly how far along we are with the
various individual parties or to name any of them specifically.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How long do you expect this process to take?</TE>
<TE>   A: We are hopeful that we will get some pretty strong indications
of where we are within the next 60 days.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you have enough money to last that long?</TE>
<TE>   A: At least. We really see our funding being sufficient to get us
through the majority of this year. So we don't feel this type of time
frame is any issue at all relative to liquidity.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Despite financial problems, you're going on a hiring binge. How
are you able to hire so many people?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's really what I refer to as reprofiling. As we transition
from the construction of the cable to a focus on recurring services
revenue, obviously you need salespeople to fuel that growth. At the
same time, you probably don't need as many of the people with the
skill sets that were appropriate to the prior stage of the company.
[The company already has fired about 25 construction workers in
Asia.] We have always said that services are going to be the
long-term future of this company. Under the circumstances, the IRU
market, or the wholesale capacity market, is not as robust as people
would have thought, and that has caused us to accelerate the roll-out
of our services and to focus more on intra-Asia services.</TE>
<TE>   Q: By recurring services revenue, do you mean the data products,
everything from private lines to VPNs?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes. As we look forward, we probably expect a bit less than
two-thirds of our business to be on the private line side of things.
What we're really focused on selling are simple, straightforward
products. Part of the reason is that the markets we serve are not as
far progressed, in terms of value-added services, as you might see in
the United States or in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How much revenue are data products bringing in?</TE>
<TE>   A: We're growing from starting this business from scratch in the
third quarter of 2000. Last year, our data services revenue was about
$80 million [and maintenance fees on the lines added $20 million].
This year, we're projecting considerably more than $100 million in
revenue with very rapid growth thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You want to accelerate your business plan, but what do you need
to make it work?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think we need to have the right people. And we have been
successful in attracting a number of new people to the company in the
last three to six months. These are people who have a strong
background building exactly the recurring revenue businesses we're
building. For instance, Bill Barney joined us from WorldCom, and he
had grown WorldCom's data services business from very small levels to
quite extensive levels over a short period of time.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Were they concerned about joining a company beset by such
financial problems?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think most people joining the company now recognize we have
challenges, and that means we also have opportunities. So I think
people see this as an exciting plan to be part of. And I think one of
the decisions that has made this easier is that these are people who
have worked together before. You not only have to have confidence in
the market, you have to have confidence in your team.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Global Crossing had committed to providing $400 million in
financing but couldn't do it. How has the loss of that money hurt
operations?</TE>
<TE>   A: In the last six months, we've had a combination of a slowdown
in the wholesale IRU market and then the ramp-up of our services
business. We're unfortunately caught in this position that though we
think our services business will grow rapidly--you can't start
services until your cable system is fairly far evolved--we are fairly
early in that cycle. Therefore, this is a peak financing time.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How much money do you figure you'll need and where do you think
it will come from?</TE>
<TE>   A: We need a few hundred million dollars, and I don't want to be
too specific. The interest we have seen [from investors] is fairly
broad. It's a combination of what you might call strategic investors
and some financial investors.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What effect does a majority owner in bankruptcy have on the
company?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think our biggest concern is simply the customer
destabilization. Any time you are related to a company that has
visible financial issues, you have to work hard to keep your customer
base informed of what the implications are on your company and as
comfortable as they can be with the situation. [They need to know]
you will continue to be a provider of services that they can rely on.
We think we can offer that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Have you lost customers because of the bankruptcy?</TE>
<TE>   A: We have not lost any significant customers because of that.</TE>

<HD>Tent Companies Tap Into a Suite Kind of Hospitality</HD>
<DH>Events: More firms are offering executives and guests a
privileged experience in outdoor corporate settings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid furiously racing cars, greasy tires getting changed and dust
flying around the pit stops of the Long Beach Grand Prix, the event's
outdoor hospitality suites were a plush, elegant oasis of black
Astroturf and linens.</LD>
<LD>   Waitresses stopped to offer refreshments as corporate VIPs
trickled in throughout the three days surrounding the race to
schmooze and find the perfect vantage point on raised platforms
protected from wind and potential showers.</LD>
<LD>   Few even noticed that they were gathered under a 10-foot-high
canvas tent, a structure that was dismantled within hours of the
final lap.</LD>
<TE>   Creating a comfortable and exclusive setting is important for the
organizers of events such as the Grand Prix because these
high-profile productions are driven by corporate sponsorships, said
Kevin O'Brien, president of marketing and sales for the Long Beach
Grand Prix.</TE>
<TE>   In return for their dollars, the companies want perks that give
their executives and guests a privileged experience.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the tent companies that provide these temporary
havens are growing in popularity by increasingly offering outdoor
event producers more than just canvas shades.</TE>
<TE>   "Corporate hospitality is done in a very classy setting. You have
environments that are in preferred facilities like stadiums and
arenas. But with the Grand Prix it's downtown, on the street,"
O'Brien said. And when a tent company can dress up an outdoor
setting, "they make our job a lot easier."</TE>
<TE>   For the Long Beach Grand Prix, employees from Torrance-based Aztec
Tents &amp; Events began setting up some 450 tents, covering 150,000
square feet of covered space about 10 days before the race. Workers
also installed 170,000 square feet of Astroturf, 15,000 chairs, 2,000
tables and 5,000 pieces of silverware. Housed within red and white
striped tents, the corporate hospitality suites were up to 800 feet
long and 20 feet wide.</TE>
<TE>   "The tents are highly visible here. The Grand Prix was the first
large event we ever did," in 1986, said Chuck Miller, Aztec's
president.</TE>
<TE>   The popular race event led the company to growth within the field
of party event equipment rentals into what is now an $11.5-million
company, based on annual revenue, that also manufactures tents, he
said. Miller refused to disclose the amount of his contract with the
Grand Prix.</TE>
<TE>   Aztec's other contracts include installing a 72,000-square-foot
tent for Raytheon Co. at the company's El Segundo plant parking lot
when the defense contractor wanted to celebrate a new contract in a
big way last year. Renting the tent, which sheltered President Bush
among others, cost $150,000 for the day. To purchase the same size
tent would have cost $850,000.</TE>
<TE>   And Aztec solved a problem another event planner had for an
upcoming meeting of world dignitaries in Cabo San Lucas by having
designers engineer a perfectly symmetrical table and tent that would
not have any of the leaders sitting at the head of the table.</TE>
<TE>   Aztec's clients vary from sporting events such as tennis, racing
and golf to business expositions, trade shows, fairs, new-car tours
and, of course, backyard weddings.</TE>
<TE>   "[Tent companies] are basically taking the outdoor wedding to the
Nth degree, which is good for us," said James Leitz, vice president
of IMG, a national sports production company based in San Francisco
that puts on massive outdoor festivals such as extreme sports
competitions, the annual Beach Bash in Hermosa Beach and the U.S.
Open in Surfing in Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "We laugh, because we're basically oversized party planners,"
Leitz said. "And no party is complete without the circus tent. When
you have a sports events like the Grand Prix or a tennis tournament,
it's basically a three-ring circus anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Academy Tent &amp; Canvas was present at the king of all circuses. The
Los Angeles-based company owned by Tom Shapiro and Maury Rice set up
more than 700,000 square feet of rented tents for the recent Winter
Olympics in Salt Lake City. And as one of the top makers of tents in
the United States, the company has found unexpected avenues for
sales.</TE>
<TE>   Rice said the development of stronger canvas and sturdier frames
is opening up a new area of growth: semi-permanent storage space.</TE>
<TE>   Companies that may need extra temporary space would rather rent a
tent than build a new building, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They have always been festive and we do a lot of sporting events,
but now you have people who require long-term temporary space using
them too," such as a computer company that used a tent to store
hardware, Rice said.</TE>
<TE>   For others, tents simply continue to be used as a shade and the
extra special touch that make outdoor events complete.</TE>
<TE>   "Tents make the festival and the look," Leitz said. "They give an
event personality with their shape and dominant arches. Sometimes
it's just for aesthetics. The roof line of a tent against a blue
sky--we hope--looks great."</TE>

<HD>Northrop Ups Offer for TRW by Nearly 13%</HD>
<DH>Defense: Surprise move, which raises hostile bid by $6 to
$53 a share, increases merger prospects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northrop Grumman Corp. said late Sunday that it will increase its
offer for TRW Inc. by nearly 13% to $53 a share, heightening the
prospects for a merger of the two defense behemoths.</LD>
<LD>   In a surprise move that came just eight days before TRW
shareholders are scheduled to consider the hostile bid, the Century
City-based company said it was raising the offer because of improving
economic conditions that have increased the value of TRW's defense
and automotive businesses.</LD>
<LD>   The latest offer is $6 more than Northrop's initial $47-a-share
bid, which TRW directors rejected as "grossly inadequate," and raises
the overall value of the all-stock deal by $752million to about
$6.7billion.</LD>
<TE>   The move is likely to make the offer more palatable to TRW
investors who have valued the firm at about $51 a share since
Northrop announced the takeover bid in February. In New York Stock
Exchange trading Friday, TRW shares closed up 49 cents at $51.97.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing it basically because the global economic conditions
have improved TRW's end market, namely the automotive business,"
Northrop spokeswoman Rosanne O'Brien said. "And the defense industry
in general continues to be very strong."</TE>
<TE>   TRW said it was reviewing the new offer and advised shareholders
"to take no action at this time."</TE>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and subsequent military
action in Afghanistan, shares of defense contractors have been rising
steadily. As such, Northrop shares reached a 52-week high last week,
to a level that meant its stock offer for Cleveland-based TRW
increased automatically.</TE>
<TE>   Under Northrop's initial proposal, the value of the bid rose if
its stock climbed past $113. In the last week, Northrop has hovered
around $118 a share, which under its formula would have raised the
bid by $2 to $49.</TE>
<TE>   Still, until Sunday, Northrop had refused to raise the bid beyond
the formula, saying it would consider doing so only if TRW allowed
the firm to look more closely at its financial information.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa reiterated calls for TRW
to open up its books.</TE>
<TE>   "We strongly encourage TRW shareholders to send a strong message
to their board of directors in favor of inviting us to conduct due
diligence," Kresa said. "If the TRW board continues to deny us
access, this offer will not proceed."</TE>
<TE>   In raising the offer, which will come in an amended filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission today, Northrop said it also
is revising the so-called "collar" for the stock exchange ratio.
Under the new formula, the offer would rise if Northrop shares rose
beyond $123 and fall if the shares fell below $113.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts have predicted that Northrop's stock could rise as
high as $160 a share in the next 12 months in anticipation of
increased defense spending.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the bid for TRW became increasingly tense in recent weeks
as both companies hired high-profile proxy solicitation specialists.
Northrop has been trying to persuade shareholders to pressure TRW
directors to begin formal negotiations, and TRW has been trying to
fend off the bid by saying it could continue independently.</TE>
<TE>   In response to Northrop's proposal, TRW directors came up with
their own breakup plan, which calls for selling the aeronautics
business and using the proceeds to pay down debt. It also would split
off its debt-laden automotive business and focus on its space and
defense electronics business, which is what Northrop covets.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Q: How much water is there on the Earth?</LD>
<LD>   A: About 326 million trillion gallons, according to www.how
stuffworks.com. Ninety-eight percent of the water is in the oceans;
only 2% is fresh water, of which 80% is locked up in the polar
icecaps and glaciers. Another 0.36% is underground in aquifers and
wells. Surprisingly, only about 0.036% of the planet's total is in
lakes and rivers. The rest is in the form of water vapor and clouds
in the atmosphere or is found in the bodies of plants and animals.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Astronomers have found two collapsed stars that they say appear to be
made of free-floating quarks, an exotic form of matter whose
existence has been theorized but never before seen. If confirmed, the
finding would enhance understanding of how matter behaves under
extreme conditions. Earth-bound physicists have been trying to
briefly create a form of quark matter at Brookhaven National
Laboratory.</LD>
<LD>   In atom-smasher experiments, physicists have shown that protons
and neutrons in the atom's core are made of tightly bound trios of
even smaller bits called quarks. Physicists infer the existence of
such confined quarks from the debris of high-energy particle
collisions. Some theorists have argued that certain collapsed stars
may produce conditions in which neutrons will be broken down into a
mass of unbound, free-floating quarks.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Women whose sexual partners are circumcised have lower rates of
cervical cancer, and their male partners have lower rates of sexually
transmitted disorders, an international team reported in Thursday's
New England Journal of Medicine. For years, doctors have known that
the human papilloma virus (HPV) is the cause of 99% of all cases of
cervical cancer and that men who have multiple sex partners are most
likely to transmit it.</LD>
<LD>   But in an analysis of seven studies in five countries, researchers
found that circumcision is key to limiting the spread of the virus
and, hence, the cancer. Only 5% of circumcised men carried HPV, they
found, compared with 20% of uncircumcised men.</LD>

<LD>Scientists have discovered a new species of whale, a startling find
made through DNA analysis of a handful of the marine mammals that
washed ashore in California over the last three decades. The 13-foot
beaked whales had been lumped together with another species of the
same family found in Australia and New Zealand. But genetic analysis
of the five known specimens of the whale indicate that they represent
a species distinct from their southern Pacific cousins, despite
looking similar.</LD>
<LD>   "Even off the coast of California, where we thought we knew
everything, we're discovering new species," said John Heyning, an
official at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, where
remains of several of the whales are housed. A report on the
discovery will be published in the journal Marine Mammal Science in
July.</LD>

<HD>When the Dangerous or Unusual Becomes the 'Normal,' Beware</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K.C. Cole</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I didn't understand what a truly bizarre place L.A. was until a few
months after I arrived and was invited to a Halloween party. Despite
considerable effort, I couldn't find an appropriate "costume": No
matter how outrageous a get-up I picked, I was informed it was
"normal" attire for someone.</LD>
<LD>   A scant year later, a friend visiting from the East Coast kept
surprising me by exclaiming every time we passed a thong bikini or a
crown of spiked hair. For her, these oddities demanded attention; for
me, they were already wallpaper.</LD>
<LD>   So it goes. What at first glance sets off sirens in your
cerebellum, after a while fails to stir up so much as a neuronal
breeze.</LD>
<TE>   I was horrified to see my daughter go to school with bra straps
showing, only to realize that all her friends were wearing more or
less the same attire. These days, I don't even notice errant
lingerie--on myself or anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   We get used to almost anything that comes upon us slowly. The
classic example is that of the frog plopped into a pot of hot
water--it will leap out. Plop the same frog into cool water and turn
the heat up slowly, and he'll sit contentedly until he's cooked.</TE>
<TE>   It can be useful not to notice things, of course. You'd be
endlessly distracted if you couldn't shut out such constant signals
as the feel of clothes on your skin, the glasses on your nose, the
nose on your face. (And when would college students ever sleep if
they couldn't tune out professors during lectures?)</TE>
<TE>   Then again, some people become so accustomed to their own bad
smells or foul manners that their "normal" becomes unbearable for
anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   Resetting "normal" means, in effect, resetting the zero point for
sensation. (Physicists even use a version of this--appropriately
enough called renormalization--to set unwanted effects to zero.) To
register, a signal needs to rise above the background--like a car
radio in a convertible. Like the stars over city lights.</TE>
<TE>   It's a now classic L.A. story: During the Northridge earthquake,
when L.A. went suddenly dark, hundreds of worried people called
Griffith Observatory wondering about those strange lights overhead.
So steadily that hardly anyone noticed, we'd been spilling city light
into the sky, washing out the stars; and while a nearly starless sky
seemed "normal," the sight of thousands of stars was shocking.</TE>
<TE>   Leave it to the Czech Republic (a nation run by a playwright) to
become the first nation (this February) to pass a law prohibiting
light pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Here's another: Not so long ago, the deadly microorganism known to
biologists as Clostridium botulinum was mostly known as the source of
a lethal poison found lurking in bulging soup cans--one of the most
poisonous substances known. Today, it's a beauty treatment, injected
at some expense into foreheads to make wrinkles go (temporarily)
away. This has gotten to be so "normal" that "Botox" parties are what
Tupperware was to my mother's generation.</TE>
<TE>   This is not a good thing, to put it mildly. According to the
editor of Science magazine, Donald Kennedy, in a recent issue of his
journal, C. botulinum ranks right after anthrax on the list of
biological weapons terrorists might employ. If the demand for Botox
continues to soar, and longer-lasting strains hit the market, as soon
seems plausible, "will we be happy to have that many of these hot
bugs around?" Kennedy asks.</TE>
<TE>   The key to spinning poison into beauty potion lies partly in the
words: Botox sounds better than botulism. It's always the way with
"normalization." A "daisy cutter" seems so Martha Stewart. "Taking
out" is a term from musical chairs, or for taking out the garbage--</TE>
<TE>   certainly not somebody's son or grandmother. No splattered blood
or melted flesh.</TE>
<TE>   In reality, a daisy cutter is, as everyone now knows, a
15,000-pound "anti-personnel" weapon. It delivers scarcely
one-thousandth the power of the Hiroshima nuclear bomb--which itself
is pathetically puny by today's (even mini-nuke) standards.</TE>
<TE>   What does it mean to scale up by a thousand? Imagine, as a
physicist friend did, that you suddenly find yourself serving dinner
for 4,000 people instead of four. Making do with the same kitchen,
same pots, same glassware. This is a fair comparison, he said,
because after all, the Earth itself--the people, the homes, the
civilizations--does not change even as firepower increases.</TE>
<TE>   The progression from conventional weapons to nuclear ones is not
like going from bra straps to tongue piercing. Closer to summing up
the situation is Einstein's remark: "I do not know with what weapons
World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with
sticks and stones."</TE>
<TE>   Good people will differ on choices of action, but you can't see
where you're going if you mistake your destination for wallpaper. Be
careful what you normalize. It might just take you out.</TE>

<HD>The Real Scorpion King</HD>
<DH>Archeological finds may push back the first known use of
writing and rewrite the history of Egyptian civilization.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The upcoming movie "The Scorpion King" is fiction, but recent
archeological studies indicate there really was a King Scorpion in
ancient Egypt and that he played a crucial role in uniting the
country and building it into the world's first empire.</LD>
<LD>   A depiction recently discovered in the Egyptian desert of the
Scorpion King's victory in battle against the forces of chaos may be
the oldest historical document ever found, some archeologists
believe.</LD>
<LD>   New discoveries in his tomb suggest that the first writing--one of
the most important developments of civilization--may have occurred
during his reign.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, his tomb in the desert at Abydos may be the rudimentary
blueprint upon which subsequent rulers based their own designs,
making it a crucial forerunner of the Great Pyramids at Giza.</TE>
<TE>   In short, King Scorpion was one of the fathers of Egyptian
civilization.</TE>
<TE>   Great achievements for a man who for nearly 5,000 years was
thought to be mythical.</TE>
<TE>   Egypt Was Divided Into Two Kingdoms</TE>
<TE>   King Scorpion dates from a time when Egypt was composed of two
separate kingdoms. Upper Egypt surrounded the upper portion of the
Nile; Lower Egypt stretched from just south of what is now Cairo
northward to the Mediterranean Sea.</TE>
<TE>   For millenniums, all the way back to the ancient Egyptian
historian Manetho and the lists of kings found in Egyptian temples,
the first true ruler of Egypt--the founder of the First Dynasty of
pharaohs--has been listed as King Menes. It was Menes who was thought
to have unified Upper and Lower Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1898, excavations at Hierakonpolis in Upper Egypt revealed
sacred objects dating back to the very beginnings of Egyptian
civilization.</TE>
<TE>   The most important of those objects was the so-called Narmer
Palette, which depicted a king not mentioned in Egyptian histories.</TE>
<TE>   This King Narmer--a name meaning "striking catfish"--was depicted
wearing both the white crown of Upper Egypt and the red crown of
Lower Egypt, suggesting it was he who had unified the two lands.</TE>
<TE>   Some scholars believe that Narmer and Menes were the same person.
Others claim Narmer was Menes' immediate predecessor and that his
name was not included on the lists for reasons that are not yet
known.</TE>
<TE>   The argument has yet to be settled.</TE>
<TE>   Mace Is Oldest Ever Discovered in Egypt</TE>
<TE>   Also found in the 1898 excavations was a mace, the traditional
symbol of kings.</TE>
<TE>   The mace--the oldest ever found in Egypt--portrays a man wearing
the white crown of Upper Egypt, accompanied by the symbols for king
and scorpion. In the absence of any supporting evidence, however,
most archeologists had believed that this King Scorpion was a
mythical figure.</TE>
<TE>   One hundred years later, however, Gunter Dreyer of the German
Archeological Institute discovered a tomb buried in the sands near
Abydos, the Egyptian necropolis, or city of the dead, that he is
confident is King Scorpion's.</TE>
<TE>   The 12-room tomb is constructed of mud bricks and appears to be a
downsized replica of Scorpion's palace.</TE>
<TE>   Although the tomb had been pillaged and the mummy stolen, Dreyer
found an ivory scepter, a clear indication that it was a royal tomb.
Carbon-14 dating showed that the scepter dates from about 3250 BC,
making it the oldest scepter found in Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   One room in the tomb was filled with pottery shards, apparently
from jars used to hold wine and other valuables for the afterlife.
Inscribed on each of the jars in ink was the symbol of a scorpion.</TE>
<TE>   Tags Could Be First Known Writing</TE>
<TE>   Dreyer's most controversial find in the tomb was a series of 160
bone and ivory tags the size of postage stamps carved with simple
pictures that Dreyer believes are primitive hieroglyphs.</TE>
<TE>   If they are, in fact, writing, they predate the commonly accepted
origin of cuneiform writing in Mesopotamia by 200 years.</TE>
<TE>   "This totally refutes the accepted theory of the origin of
writing," Dreyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Renee Friedman of the British Museum speculates that King Scorpion
ordered the development of writing to record the payment of taxes to
the royal treasury.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the tags, Dreyer says, are documentary records of linen
and oil delivered to King Scorpion, short notes, numbers, lists of
kings' names and names of institutions.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Yale University archeologist John Darnell and his
wife Deborah have discovered a primitive scene carved on rocks near
the Qena Bend of the Nile River that appears to commemorate a victory
by King Scorpion, who already ruled the kingdoms of Abydos and
Hierakonpolis, over the kingdom of Naqada--a city that worshipped
Set, the god of chaos.</TE>
<TE>   Carving May Signify an Early Unification</TE>
<TE>   Darnell believes it is the oldest known historical document, and
that it signifies the unification of Upper Egypt 150 years before
Narmer unified the entire country.</TE>
<TE>   Conquest of Naqada gave King Scorpion control not only of the
Nile, but of crucial roads leading east to the Red Sea and west to
the oases of the western desert.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called Scorpion Tableau shows a figure wearing the white
crown of Upper Egypt, identified as King Scorpion, wielding a mace
over a wild-haired captive next to a bull's head mounted on a stick.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not sure how it is pronounced yet, but that symbol
represents the name of Naqada's king," Darnell said.</TE>
<TE>   Next to the figures is the image of a stork devouring a snake.</TE>
<TE>   The stork represents Horus, the patron god of Abydos, while the
snake is Set, the patron god of Naqada. This symbol later evolved
into a common hieroglyphic symbolizing victory.</TE>
<TE>   Before Dynasty One,There Was Dynasty Zero</TE>
<TE>   "Before Dynasty One began with the unification of Egypt, there was
a Dynasty Zero that began with the unification of the south," Darnell
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew it happened, but we didn't know how.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, the discoveries about King Scorpion are giving us a handle
on what really did happen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A documentary about the search for the Scorpion King will appear
on the History Channel at 9 p.m. April 23.</TE>

<HD>2 Tragic Cases Show Marked Contrasts</HD>
<DH>Crime: Gender plays a role in media coverage when a parent
is accused of killing children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unlike Andrea Yates, the Houston mother convicted of drowning her
five children, Adair Garcia of Pico Rivera hardly stirred a ripple in
the national news when he was accused of killing five of his
children.</LD>
<LD>   No network TV trucks lined up outside the courthouse March 19 as
he pleaded not guilty to killing the children by lighting a barbecue
grill in his living room. No news conferences. Only a handful of
local journalists showed up.</LD>
<LD>   Some wonder whether a double standard was at work.</LD>
<TE>   "As a city leader, I am happy that the Garcia case did not turn
into a major media circus," said Pico Rivera Mayor Greg Salcido. But
"it kind of makes you feel like five lives in Pico Rivera do not mean
as much as five lives in Houston."</TE>
<TE>   The Yates case was chronicled in more than 1,150 published
articles nationally in the first four weeks after police discovered
the children, according to a database of newspapers, magazines,
scientific journals and legal documents. The case of Garcia, who is
scheduled to be arraigned today, resulted in 77 over a similar
period.</TE>
<TE>   Why the disparity? Many elements played a role, among them gender
and the way the children died. The Yates case was more newsworthy,
experts say, in part because it was more surprising.</TE>
<TE>   "A father going nuts is less abnormal than a mother going nuts and
doing something heinous to her children," said Jim Naughton,
president of the Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank in
Florida. "In our culture, the female parent is emblematic of
nurturing."</TE>
<TE>   The Yates case, media experts say, fascinated the media and the
public for a variety of reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Bryce Nelson, a journalism professor at USC's Annenberg School of
Communication, said Yates' mental condition contributed to the
story's dramatic appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Yates, 36, faced a type of mental anguish rarely talked about by
the news media, Nelson said. She had been on medication for
postpartum depression and murdered her five children--ages 6 months
to 7 years--by drowning them in the family bathtub.</TE>
<TE>   "Women identified with what she was going through," said Nelson.
"Some felt sympathy for her, but I do not think that anyone could
have imagined depression leading to what she did."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Yates' husband continued to support her also drove
the story, Nelson said. "How could anyone have all their children
killed and still stick with their wife?" Nelson said. "In a grotesque
kind of way, this kind of stuff fascinates people."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia also faced mental anguish, according to authorities, but of
a more common type. Garcia was depressed, police allege, over his
failing marriage. His wife had been gone for a week when, on Feb. 20,
Garcia tucked his children into bed, investigators said, lighted a
barbecue grill and went to sleep as the house filled with poisonous
carbon monoxide.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda, 10; Jonathan, 7; and Anthony, 2, were dead when rescue
workers arrived the next morning. Cecilia, 4, died later that day,
and Vanessa, 6, the next day. Only 9-year-old Kassandra survived.</TE>
<TE>   The deaths did not create the same mental images as those of the
Yates children, who died struggling and gasping for air as their
mother held them underwater, a doctor testified at her trial. Yates
had to chase the oldest, 7-year-old Noah, throughout the house. When
she finally caught him, he cried and apologized to his mother,
thinking he must have done something wrong. He was found face down in
the bottom of the bathtub.</TE>
<TE>   The surviving family members also played a role in how the story
was portrayed. The Garcia family was reluctant to speak to the media,
mainly to protect their surviving daughter, investigators said.
Russell Yates, by contrast, held a news conference the day after his
children were killed and frequently granted interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Yates even established a "Yates Kids Home Page," to "honor
the memory of our children, Noah, John, Paul, Luke and Mary, who died
tragically on June 20, 2001. I'd like this to be a place that anyone
can go to 'visit' the children."</TE>
<TE>   Yates also allowed media coverage of the funeral and memorial
service. The Garcia family, with the help of the sheriff's station in
Pico Rivera, held a private burial at Rose Hills Memorial Cemetery.
One TV cameraman tried to sneak in, but he was shooed away by
deputies.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the killings, the Garcias appeared to be a private
family, and their neighbors on Washington Boulevard had very little
to say about the family, only that they appeared happy when they were
out in public.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers of the Yates and Garcia cases see them as an
example of sexist bias. Among them is Susanna Cornett, operator of
Cut on the Bias, a Web site that specializes in pointing out bias and
spins in media and crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Yates' situation was extreme in a variety of ways, and perhaps
her psychosis did result in the deaths of her children," said
Cornett, a doctoral student in criminal justice at Rutgers
University. "But I think we do damage to our judicial system when we
consider that she is a mother who did this, rather than she is a
parent who did this."</TE>
<TE>   With so many similarities, Cornett says, coverage should have been
almost equal.</TE>
<TE>   But stories that are similar have had different media impact in
the past, Naughton said. He cited stories about workplace shootings
as an example.</TE>
<TE>   Shootings at the workplace always make headlines, but when James
Huberty walked into a San Ysidro McDonald's in 1984 and gunned down
21 people, before being killed himself, it was much more than a
workplace shooting story.</TE>
<TE>   "Why? It was McDonald's," he said. "A cultural icon. A place that
most Americans consider safe. It was a national story."</TE>
<TE>   At Garcia's last court appearance, Evelina Salas of Whittier
happened to be in the courtroom, waiting to handle a traffic matter.</TE>
<TE>   Salas had noticed days before that candles and flowers were no
longer in front of the Garcia house. It looked abandoned to her.
Salas, 24, had followed early coverage of the killings and wondered
why she hadn't heard more.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was over," she said, surprised to hear that the
legal process was just getting started.</TE>

<HD>Avocados May Get National Ad Campaign</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Growers will vote in summer on whether to
assess a fee for research and promotion. The levy could raise up to
$14 million a year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County avocado growers are preparing to take part this summer
in a nationwide vote on a promotional drive that could do for their
industry what the "Got milk?" campaign has done for dairy farmers.</LD>
<LD>   More than 6,000 growers and importers will be eligible to decide
whether to tax themselves to create a national board responsible for
carving out new markets and boosting consumption of the pear-shaped
fruit.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Department of Agriculture published rules for the
referendum last week in the Federal Register.</LD>
<TE>   "We've got a good product, and we want to do what we can to
increase demand," said Roger Essick, who farms 200 acres of avocados
in Ojai and Fillmore and serves on the board of directors of the
California Avocado Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can get people in the rest of the country eating avocados
like they do out West, I think it will be money well spent," Essick
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Avocado Commission and grower groups have long been
involved in a variety of promotional campaigns, the federal program
seeks to broaden those efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the 21/2-cents- per-pound assessment say that
California growers--who produce 90% of the U.S. crop--have paid most
of the costs for market research and promotion.</TE>
<TE>   But as avocado imports have increased, particularly from countries
such as Mexico and Chile, California growers have searched for ways
to ensure that foreign growers pay a share of those costs.</TE>
<TE>   The California Avocado Commission pushed legislation, adopted last
year, requiring the USDA to put the issue to a vote.</TE>
<TE>   "We know there is going to come a time when the only way for
everyone to be successful in the market is to build demand in the
United States," said commission Vice President Tom Bellamore, who
estimates the assessment could generate more than $14 million a year
for research and promotional efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "Here in California, we eat a lot of avocados," he added, "but
there are other parts of the country where there is still much work
to be done."</TE>
<TE>   Similar programs have been successful in building demand.</TE>
<TE>   The USDA oversees a dozen national boards for everything from
mushrooms to watermelon, in which producers agree to tax themselves
to pay for research and promotion.</TE>
<TE>   Cattlemen pay $1 a head to fund a variety of promotional
activities, including the national advertising campaign that
generated the slogan, "Beef, it's what for dinner."</TE>
<TE>   Milk producers pay 15 cents per hundredweight for similar efforts,
and in 1993 hit the mother lode with their successful "Got milk?"
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The effort was said to have boosted sales and consumption.</TE>
<TE>   Avocado growers don't know if they can hit it quite as big. But
many across California are willing to give it a try.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we'll generate as much money to do what milk and
beef have done, but we will be able to break into new markets across
the nation," said Jerome Stehly, a second-generation avocado farmer
in northern San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   "But in order to do that, we need more money to advertise and we
need [importers] to pay their fair share," Stehly said.</TE>
<TE>   The vote will take place from June 24 to July 12. If a majority of
those who take part in the balloting support the program, the USDA
will assemble a national board to set policy for the research and
promotional efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a strong 'yes' vote, and I think you'll find that kind of
support throughout the industry," Santa Paula rancher Richard Pidduck
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the Avocado Commission would have gotten this far
if [the program] didn't have broad industry support," Pidduck said.</TE>

<HD>Making Textbooks a Bargaining Tool for Teachers Is a Tough
Sell</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   It seemed like a smart idea: The state was broke, so don't bother
lobbying for more money. Push instead for something with no cost, but
still highly desired.</LD>
<LD>   If you're the state's biggest teachers union--a powerful political
player expected to deliver every year for your 300,000 members--this
is the answer:</LD>
<TE>   Teachers are the experts and they want a louder voice in what they
teach. So seek legislation making textbooks and curriculum part of
collective bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   Whoops! Not  a smart idea.</TE>
<TE>   Labor bosses, salary haggling and the McGuffey Reader--or whatever
it is children study these days--simply do not have a harmonious
ring. Teachers abandoning their classrooms and hitting the bricks
over some reading program?</TE>
<TE>   There were screams of protest from school boards and
administrators, business leaders and editorial writers. Quiet gripes
even from some of the union's political beneficiaries, nervous
Democratic legislators squeezed between their potent patrons and
community leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Hyperbole, responds the California Teachers Assn. There'd be no
strikes over textbooks or curriculum. "Teachers won't walk for
anything except money," says CTA President Wayne Johnson, a former
L.A. high school instructor.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, he notes, the bill merely would require negotiation of the
"procedures" for selecting curriculum and textbooks.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, sure, counters Kevin Gordon of the California Assn. of
School Business Officials: "This bill is all about greater leverage
on compensation issues. The broader they can make the scope of
bargaining, the more chips they have."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, opponents add, collective bargaining is combative and
not always civil. Do we want textbook decisions caught up in that?</TE>
<TE>   Not on his watch, proclaimed Gov. Gray Davis, who last week
declared he'd veto the bill if it passed. "Teachers should have a
role" in advising which textbooks are selected by local school
boards, he said. But "I don't want textbooks to be held hostage to
issues involving wages.</TE>
<TE>   "The teachers' role is now advisory. Sometimes it's heeded.
Sometimes it is not. I would like to see it formalized, but not in a
way that links it to collective bargaining."</TE>
<TE>   Later in an interview, Davis said he and lawmakers are
"brainstorming" a possible compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers' views "should matter at least as much as
administrators'," he said. Perhaps there could be some sort of
"academic senate" like at the state universities, but with less
power.</TE>
<TE>   The "hard work" in selecting textbooks, Davis continued, actually
is done by the state Board of Education, which whittles the choices
to two or three. Maybe the final pick could be made by a six-member
committee split evenly between teachers and administrators. "If
there's a tie, then the state board decides.</TE>
<TE>   "Or you could do it a lot of ways: two parents, two teachers, two
administrators.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just an idea. I'm just throwing this out."</TE>
<TE>   Governors'  ideas tend to become bills--especially when the idea
already is kicking around the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   "A faculty senate becomes a joke--a debating society," responds
CTA's Johnson. "We want to put it into the bargaining process to give
it teeth."</TE>
<TE>   The CTA spent about $2 million helping to elect Davis. For his
reelection so far, it has donated only $62,000. Johnson predicts
"most of our teachers will just sit on their hands. They're not going
to a phone bank. They're not going to write checks. They see him
siding with bureaucrats over teachers."</TE>
<TE>   We'll see. Under Davis, the state has increased money for
teachers' salaries by 30%, granted unprecedented income tax credits
up to $1,500 and boosted pensions.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature's most ardent advocate of the bill is the author,
Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles), a former teacher and
school board member. She says the bill's opponents should "stop
screaming the sky is falling, which is exactly what they did before
we got collective bargaining [in 1975]. Did the world end? No."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, she adds, "all these guys are becoming victims of their
own rhetoric. Wayne Johnson says we're not going to amend it. And I
say, 'Yes we are.' At some point, we're going to come to the table.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm not going to explore that while people are being so
insulting to teachers."</TE>
<TE>   The bill's first hearing will be Tuesday in the Assembly Public
Employees Committee. It's expected to survive and be sent to the
Education Committee, where the sell could be tougher.</TE>
<TE>   Here's an idea: Everybody settle down and help the teachers exert
more control over their teaching. Get them more involved in
decision-making and pay them for the extra work. Mandate for every
district what's already working well in some. But chuck the
collective bargaining notion.</TE>
<TE>   The union still would be delivering for teachers--just not
negotiating about textbooks.</TE>

<HD>Westwood Fears Dead Could Lie Too Close</HD>
<DH>Cemetery: The owner of the resting place for Marilyn Monroe
and Jack Lemmon wants to build at property lines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They're heeeeere!</LD>
<LD>   That's the cry being raised in Westwood, where life threatens to
imitate art in a "Poltergeist"-like dispute between homes and graves.</LD>
<LD>   This time it is a cemetery that is being criticized for wanting to
put graves almost on top of nearby homes, however. Not the other way
around, as in the Steven Spielberg-produced 1982 horror movie.</LD>
<TE>   Operators of the Westwood Village Memorial Park plan to triple its
capacity by building nearly 2,100 above-ground crypts along the
cemetery's south side.</TE>
<TE>   Angry neighbors say the project would result in bodies towering 20
feet over their backyards.</TE>
<TE>   The cemetery at 1218 Glendon Ave. is tucked between Wilshire
Boulevard high-rise office buildings and a 75-year-old neighborhood
of single-family homes. Although it covers less than three acres, it
is world-famous as the final resting place for such Hollywood
celebrities as Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Natalie Wood.</TE>
<TE>   Actresses Dominique Dunne and Heather O'Rourke, stars of
"Poltergeist" who met untimely deaths, are also interred there.</TE>
<TE>   The movie depicted spirits taking revenge for a housing tract
built over a graveyard. O'Rourke, who died at age 12 from congenital
stenosis of the intestine, portrayed the pint-size character Carol
Anne who announced the arrival of ghosts by uttering the film's most
notable line: "They're heeeeere!"</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles laws call for a fenced-in and landscaped 300-foot
buffer between cemetery structures and residential property. But the
Texas company that owns the Westwood cemetery wants a waiver that
would allow some mausoleum walls to be built right up to the property
line. Other areas would have a 10-foot setback between the walls and
the property line.</TE>
<TE>   Houston-based Service Corp. International, which bills itself as
"the world's largest provider of funeral and cemetery services," is
asking the city to classify the expansion as a "public benefit
project."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors scoff at that. They say the cemetery company stands to
make as much as $70 million by boosting the capacity from its current
1,126 casket spaces to 3,089.</TE>
<TE>   "This is big-box architecture. It's a warehouse of corpses. It's
that obscene to us," said resident Lila Rioth. "That's packing a lot
of bodies in what has been a beautiful cemetery."</TE>
<TE>   Rioth, herself an architect who lives on Wellworth Avenue,
directly south of the cemetery, said homeowners should not be forced
to look out their kitchen windows at mausoleums.</TE>
<TE>   "And out of respect for the dead, people who are visiting the
cemetery shouldn't hear people playing in their backyard pools or
smell chicken on the barbecue grill when they are visiting their
loved ones."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Tamar Hoffs, a screenwriter, agreed. "They want to make
the back wall of the mausoleum the back wall of the property. Can you
imagine children batting tennis balls off of it? I think it will be a
sacrilege of huge proportion for those bodies not to have serenity."</TE>
<TE>   Residents Elliot Lewis and Lili Young are among those who have
also condemned the expansion for its potential effect on traffic and
parking in the congested Westwood area.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners protested the project last week at a Planning
Department hearing. City hearing officer Jon Foreman said he will
rule on the application after a public comment period ends today.</TE>
<TE>   Initially called the Sunset Cemetery, Pierce Bros. Westwood
Village Memorial Park was surrounded by fields when it was created in
1888, according to Westwood historian Greg Fischer. It was owned by
the Pierce family--which for a time lived on Wellworth Avenue--before
Service Corp. International bought it about 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The cemetery has had a high profile since 1962, when Marilyn
Monroe was laid to rest there after dying of a drug overdose. For
more than 20 years her ex-husband, baseball great Joe DiMaggio, had
fresh flowers delivered regularly to her crypt. The space next to
Monroe's crypt was later acquired by Playboy magazine publisher Hugh
Hefner.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrities buried there include actors Burt Lancaster, Dean
Martin and Carroll O'Connor; writers Truman Capote and Will and Ariel
Durant; and musicians Frank Zappa, Mel Torme and the Beach Boys' Carl
Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Until the late 1990s, nearby homeowners were shielded from the
burial area by cemetery offices and chapel buildings and open space.
But a new interment area that contains the remains of figures such as
Walter Matthau and George C. Scott has been developed near the
chapel.</TE>
<TE>   Cemetery manager Kathy Boyett declined to comment on the expansion
plan. But a spokesman for Service Corp. International said the new
mausoleum space would resemble crypt structures currently in use
there.</TE>
<TE>   Reading from a statement, spokesman Greg Bolton said his company
"has been in contact with local residents and the Westwood Homeowners
Assn. to assure them this construction will have no adverse impact on
the surrounding area."</TE>
<TE>   The homeowners association has come out in opposition to the
expansion plan, however. And City Councilman Jack Weiss, who
represents the Westwood area, said he is "very concerned" about the
project.</TE>
<TE>   "The issues raised by the residents are legitimate and must be
addressed," Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   City planning officials said Foreman's recommendation will be
forwarded to the Planning Commission. A City Council committee will
review the application and the commission's recommendation before
Weiss and his colleagues are asked to consider any "public benefit"
designation.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, Westwood residents said they are prepared to go to
court if necessary to fight the project. Theirs is one neighborhood,
they pledge, that isn't about to roll over and die.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County planners are rewriting the rules for code enforcement
after an internal review confirmed complaints from rural residents.
The complaints say inspectors have behaved like police, arming
themselves, racing with flashing lights down twisting back roads and
conducting possibly illegal searches.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Zeiler, for one, said he was taken aback when an
official-looking white car and a deputy sheriff's vehicle sped up his
driveway in remote Williams Canyon last May, lights flashing.</LD>
<LD>   "Whatever it was and whenever it happened, I didn't do it," he
recalled joking nervously to a large man who exited the white car.
When the man identified himself as a county code-enforcement officer,
Zeiler relaxed, slightly.</LD>
<TE>   Zeiler said he explained that the pile of dirt in his frontyard
was there because he needed to shore up a low spot that had developed
after the main dirt road through the canyon was paved and raised.
He'd researched the law, he said, and if you had less than 50 cubic
yards of dirt, you didn't need a permit.</TE>
<TE>   When the inspector questioned him about construction work on the
house, he said he had permits and offered to go inside and get them.</TE>
<TE>   "You stay right where you are!" barked the sheriff's deputy,
placing his hand on his holstered gun, Zeiler recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Zeiler said he stayed put as the code officer wrote him up for
illegal grading and earth movement--of 500 cubic yards. He has
refused to pay the fines, saying he was perfectly within his rights,
and that the code officer and the deputy were wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Complaints about that type of "very heavy-handed" response led to
an internal review and redrafting of policy, said Brian Murphy,
spokesman for the county Planning and Development Services
Department, which oversees the 3-year-old inspection program.</TE>
<TE>   "When we heard about this, we said, 'Whoa, this is not the
direction we want to be going,'" Murphy said. "We do not want a
law-enforcement image."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy said that although code officers occasionally face hostile
property owners, threatening dogs or other risks, the tactics
described by Zeiler and other complaining residents were not
appropriate. He said the officers would not be available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the planning department's review, a survey of code
enforcement in nearby cities and other Southern California counties
was done. None were using a law-enforcement approach except the city
of Orange, which has one police officer assigned to it.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Spitzer, the Third District county supervisor, said he
ordered the review after hearing complaints from residents of Orange
County's rural edge. The code-enforcement staff primarily covers the
rural canyons and unincorporated islands in the northern part of the
county, including west Anaheim, Santa Ana Heights, El Modena and
Midway City.</TE>
<TE>   "On the one hand, you want your code enforcement to be vigorous.
On the other hand, you don't want them to overstep their bounds,"
Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   The review, Spitzer said, found that inspectors were arming
themselves with pepper spray, bulletproof vests and "saps," which are
small, sand-filled weapons sometimes used by police instead of
batons. They also were speeding through narrow canyon roads with
amber lights flashing, and occasionally were working with armed
off-duty sheriff's deputies, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, they were just acting like cops," said Spitzer.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy, the planning department spokesman, said the amber lights
and bulletproof vests have already been taken away, and more changes
are coming.</TE>
<TE>   "There were some individuals who were carrying these things on
their own. None of this was official-issue equipment," Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he did not know if any of the officers have been
disciplined.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why code enforcement officers would use such equipment and
otherwise behave as if they were police, Murphy said, "Sometimes it
could be overzealousness. Or they might have suspected something far
worse than what they found when they actually got there."</TE>
<TE>   In December, the Board of Supervisors, following recommendations
by the planning staff, voted unanimously that the aim of code
enforcement officers should be voluntary compliance by residents and
that their approach should be administrative.</TE>
<TE>   This week, a manual proposed for adoption will be considered by
county agencies and representatives of the public. It recommends that
inspectors seek voluntary compliance with building codes first and
would require them to obtain search warrants if they were not allowed
onto property. Code officers also would be required to wear "business
casual" attire, rather than uniforms, and take communication and
civil-rights training sessions.</TE>
<TE>   But Murphy warned that for Zeiler--whose case is pending--and
others, citations and fines would not disappear because of the way
they had been issued.</TE>
<TE>   "In the event it was handled poorly, that still doesn't disqualify
[a citation]," Murphy said.</TE>

<HD>State Energy Consultant Is on Edison Payroll</HD>
<DH>Ethics: The firm paid a retainer of $100,000 or more last
year to former executive who helped negotiate power pacts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- The parent company of Southern California Edison paid
$100,000 or more last year to a former executive who has done no work
for the company but has helped negotiate long-term electricity
contracts for California power buyers, according to state records and
Edison officials.</LD>
<LD>   The former executive, Vikram Budhraja, said Edison International
agreed to pay him a retainer of at least $100,000 a year when he
resigned as a Southern California Edison senior vice president in
January 2000. The money gives the company the right to consult with
him, Budhraja said.</LD>
<LD>   "That's the arrangement I worked out with Edison," he said.</LD>
<TE>   It is not clear exactly how much Edison is paying Budhraja. As a
consultant to state power buyers, he is required to disclose his
sources of income. The state forms ask a filer to mark off boxes that
indicate broad ranges of income. In Budhraja's case, he checked the
box indicating gross income of more than $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Budhraja and Edison officials refused to release copies of his
current or past contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "Like most major corporations," said Brian Bennett, Edison
international vice president of external affairs, "we retain the
services of specialists so that, when needed, their expertise is
immediately available."</TE>
<TE>   Bennett said Budhraja has done no work for the Rosemead-based
utility since the third quarter of 2000, when he was asked to assist
with litigation over a 1996 power outage. The contract was renewed
for 2002, Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   Budhraja said he would recuse himself from any consulting work for
state power buyers that directly involved Edison. While on retainer
to Edison, Budhraja has a $6.2-million contract with power buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Since January 2001, the state has been buying electricity to fill
in the gap between what the customers of Edison, Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric use and what the utilities can
generate themselves with nuclear and hydroelectric plants. Secretary
of State Bill Jones, who last summer called for investigations of
possible conflicts of interest among Gov. Gray Davis' energy
advisors, said he was outraged to learn that Budhraja was still
taking money from Edison while advising state electricity buyers.</TE>
<TE>   "How in the world in the last 18 months," Jones said, "can he
possibly make the case that he's been working for the state and not
come in contact or had a conflict with the second-largest energy
company in California?"</TE>
<TE>   Jones, an unsuccessful contender for the Republican nomination for
governor in last month's primary election, said he hoped that the
Fair Political Practices Commission, the Securities Exchange
Commission and the state attorney general's office would step up
their probes of Budhraja and others hired by Davis, a Democrat,
during the electricity crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "It just shows you the arrogance of power in this administration,"
Jones said. "They've ignored the ethics of this."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers Action
Network in San Diego, said retainers are common in the utility
business. Sometimes companies pay experts to prevent them from
working for competitors, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The outsider has legitimate reason to be unnerved by these
arrangements," he said, "but it gives a sense of the degree to which
there's a lot of incestuous relations."</TE>
<TE>   Budhraja's arrangement with Edison and the Department of Water
Resources is "more condemnatory of the business than it is
condemnatory of the man," Shames said.</TE>
<TE>   An engineer whose colleagues praise him as a technical wizard on
many aspects of the electric utility business, Budhraja left Southern
California Edison in January 2000 to join a consulting company he
helped found, called Electric Power Group. Many employees of the firm
are former Edison employees.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2001, the Davis administration gave Electric Power
Group a $6.2-million contract to help the state Department of Water
Resources take over the power-buying role of utilities that had been
drained of cash and good credit by seven months of exorbitant
electricity prices.</TE>
<TE>   The department used its new authority to sign long-term power
contracts at prices lower than the spot market. Budhraja helped
negotiate many of the biggest of 56 agreements with energy companies.
Valued at a combined $43 billion, those contracts ultimately will be
paid for by utility customers through their monthly bills.</TE>
<TE>   Although the contracts helped spare the state from extraordinarily
high market prices last spring, a range of critics now call them too
expensive and ill-matched to California's power consumption patterns.</TE>
<TE>   Budhraja said his company's current work for the water resources
department includes forecasting power needs and managing the
long-term power contracts. He said he told both the department and
Edison that he would recuse himself from any consulting work at the
department that directly involved Edison. He also said Department of
Water Resources officials knew of his relationship with the utility
before they hired him.</TE>
<TE>   Budhraja's consulting work has raised questions of conflicts of
interest in the past. The SEC inquired into his stock ownership last
summer at the behest of Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Budhraja's personal financial disclosure forms from July show that
he bought multiple blocks of Edison International stock in January
2001, just before going to work as a consultant for the state. He
sold the stock within 12 days.</TE>

<DH>Justice: Restitution center is for women who stole. They
repay debts, avoid prison.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gina Faison takes the bus every morning to the downtown Los Angeles
law office where she works.</LD>
<LD>   She cannot leave the building for lunch with colleagues. She
cannot stop at the mall after work. Nor can she go home to her
husband and three young sons at night.</LD>
<LD>   Faison, a paralegal and convicted thief, is serving an unusual
three-year sentence at California's only restitution center for
women.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know if I could have made it over the wall," said Faison,
a 38-year-old first offender, referring to state prison.</TE>
<TE>   She is one of 43 women now living at the minimum-security facility
in Pico-Union, where inmates wear whatever they like, sleep two to
six in a bedroom and sip their morning coffee outside under bright
blue awnings.</TE>
<TE>   The program is designed to move nonviolent inmates from prison
into the work force to repay their victims, said Doris Mahlum,
district administrator for the state Department of Corrections.</TE>
<TE>   Participants have paid $250,000 in court-ordered restitution in
the last two years, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite increased prosecution of white-collar criminals and the
popularity of alternative sentences for nonviolent offenders, the
restitution center has operated in relative obscurity since 1971.</TE>
<TE>   It serves inmates from throughout California, but rarely, if ever,
have all 100 beds been occupied at once. Ten are now empty.</TE>
<TE>   To qualify, inmates must be nonviolent, must have been ordered to
pay restitution and sentenced to three years or less. They are
required to get a job and turn over two-thirds of their salary to
their victims and the state to defray the costs of incarceration.</TE>
<TE>   The women are housed in a beige one-story structure built in 1910
as the Chase Sanatorium in a residential area on West 18th Street
near Union Avenue. A 50-bed men's center is in a renovated motel in
an industrial section of South La Cienega Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the general prison population, most of the inmates are
educated and have marketable job skills, said Cheryl
Atterbury-Brooks, the parole officer assigned to the women's center.</TE>
<TE>   "We have doctors, lawyers, nurses," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A few earn more than the staff that supervises them. Program
manager Ernest Green recalled a geologist convicted of fraud who was
paid $30 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the women work in offices and restaurants. Banks are
strictly off-limits.</TE>
<TE>   They are banned from working "too close to where they dirtied
their hands before," Mahlum said. "I don't want them to get sticky
fingers."</TE>
<TE>   Employers are told they are hiring inmates who have defrauded or
embezzled money, often from a previous employer.</TE>
<TE>   A few of Encino attorney I. Mark Bledstein's clients, including
Armen Oganesyan, have been sentenced to a restitution center.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Oganesyan, 26, was ordered to spend 16 months there and
pay $50,000 in restitution for hacking into his former employer's
computer. He is a first-time offender with a wife with two young
children.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great benefit to this guy ... and the victim gets the
money," Bledstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Toni Medina, 41, was lucky. She got the first job she applied for.</TE>
<TE>   The former suburban San Diego housewife has been a waitress at a
Denny's restaurant in Mid-Wilshire for more than a year. Now she's
the restaurant's top waitress and a candidate for management
training.</TE>
<TE>   Life is so good that some days Medina said she forgets she's a
prisoner. She recently turned down a police officer who asked for her
telephone number, and jokingly offered to give him her "W" or prison
number.</TE>
<TE>   But Medina said she would never break the center's rules, for fear
of being sent back to prison.</TE>
<TE>   Serious violations, including escapes, can add up to 36 months to
an inmate's sentence. Lesser offenses can get an inmate transferred
back to prison.</TE>
<TE>   "When they do go back, it's horrible," Medina said. "They scream,
kick and cry."</TE>
<TE>   In the evenings, the women eat dinner together, watch television,
use pay telephones in the hallway. They wash their own clothes and,
if they like, can order pizza.</TE>
<TE>   The dorm-style rooms each have a small bathroom with a toilet and
sink. Communal showers are located in each wing.</TE>
<TE>   Family visitation is from noon to 4 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   After 14 months at the center, Medina has bittersweet feelings
about returning home this week.</TE>
<TE>   She feels a strong bond with the other women. And she's proud of
her professional accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   "You actually start a life, and all of a sudden you are paroled
and you have to go back to your county and start a life," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Medina, who divorced in prison, plans to return to San Diego to
live with her three children. A secret addiction to crystal
methamphetamine led to her arrest in a check and credit card fraud
ring.</TE>
<TE>   She suspects prison would have hardened her--and destroyed the
little self-esteem she had left.</TE>
<TE>   Medina said she is grateful for the safe and nurturing alternative
to prison.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm walking out as a productive member of society," she said. "I
can guarantee you, I will never be back."</TE>

<HD>Stark, Bitter Debate Plays Out Over Dunes</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Environmentalists upset about plans to reopen
protected desert to off-roaders take 13-mile trek to call attention
to its fragility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALGODONES DUNES</DL>
<LD>The afternoon sun brought long shadows, tall tales and dire warnings.</LD>
<LD>   For two days, a band of environmental activists trudged across
what is believed to be the nation's largest sand dune system, hugging
the ridges of 300-foot dunes, leaning into a wind so fierce that it
felt like a blow-dryer between the eyes.</LD>
<LD>   Their opponents dismiss them as greens, and they lived up to the
label last weekend--eating tofu, trading tales of demonstrations and
arrests, marveling at any hint of nature, including at one point the
droppings of a kangaroo rat.</LD>
<TE>   About 26 miles east of Brawley, the dunes stretch nearly 40 miles
from the Chocolate Mountains to the Mexican border, about 150,000
acres in all. They are a natural enigma, distant and dead at first
glance, but actually teeming with life--strange life, from albino
grasshoppers to horned lizards that flatten out into discs to protect
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The trek, organized by the Tucson- and Idyllwild-based Center for
Biological Diversity, was designed to call attention to the fragility
of the dunes' plants and animals, and to the government's recent
decision to open a broad swath of protected land here to off-road
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   That decision, center officials believe, has made the dunes the
most threatened landscape in California.</TE>
<TE>   The 13-mile hike was no small feat, and by the time they cleared
the eastern dunes and strode into a mudflat wash amid gnarled morning
glories and 1,000-year-old ironwoods, there was a swagger in their
step. Despite their dire warnings about the devastation that dune
buggies and all-terrain vehicles would bring here, they spoke of
commitment and their campaign to preserve this ecological wonder.</TE>
<TE>   Beneath that bravado, though, like the sand itself--which shifts
two feet a year toward Mexico--they know they are losing traction.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, after Congress declared millions of acres of remote
Western land off-limits to commercial enterprises, wildlife officials
were taken aback by a boom in hiking and camping.</TE>
<TE>   The surge in interest forced government agencies to wrestle with
the then-puzzling notion that mountains, deserts and forests could be
overrun--loved to death by outdoor enthusiasts.</TE>
<TE>   Today, marking the latest chapter in a long tug-of-war over
wilderness, another outdoors renaissance is underway. This one is
borne not of backpacks and boots, but of machines--snowmobiles, dune
buggies and Jet Skis.</TE>
<TE>   And the machines--their drivers emboldened by a friendly response
from the current occupant of the White House--are winning:</TE>
<TE>   * Last spring, the Bush administration decided to review bans on
personal watercraft at four national parks. Buoyed by that decision,
an Orange County group recently sued the federal government to throw
out similar proposed bans at 21 seashore and recreation areas--though
environmentalists say the watercraft spew the same amount of
pollution in seven hours that a car does every 100,000 miles.</TE>
<TE>   * The administration is considering throwing out a plan to phase
out snowmobiles at Yellowstone National Park. President Clinton set
that plan in motion because of concerns that snowmobiles were
harassing elk and bison and turning the air blue with exhaust.</TE>
<TE>   * The federal government has taken steps to weaken protection of
roadless areas in national forests, a move that could allow more
roads in places like Los Padres National Forest and opening
once-protected regions to commercial development.</TE>
<TE>   Those changes have accompanied a dramatic rise in the use of
so-called thrill-craft--which was prompted by aging baby boomers'
sudden discovery that roaring up a sand dune on a $40,000 souped-up
dune buggy was more fun than climbing it.</TE>
<TE>   "For those of us in the 'boom' generation, 20 years ago, hey,
backpacking and hiking was a great idea," said Bill Horn, a
Washington attorney who represents snowmobilers and a group of
anglers and hunters fighting to keep Florida's Big Cypress National
Preserve open to swamp buggies and airboats.</TE>
<TE>   "Now you've got a couple of kids and you've been sitting at a desk
for 20 years. And you think, 'You know, I don't think I can walk up
that mountain.' So you get a motorized vehicle, and then you can
plant your broadening derriere on that."</TE>
<TE>   But environmentalists are convinced that the machines are
shattering the tranquillity of wild areas across the nation,
harassing rare animals and trampling delicate plants that are those
animals' homes and food sources.</TE>
<TE>   "These areas we are talking about are public trusts," said Derek
Shuman, 46, a UC Berkeley mechanical engineer and a hiking enthusiast
who joined the Center for Biological Diversity for last weekend's
trek. "If we lose it, we lose it forever. I don't think this
administration understands that. The Bush administration seems to be
giving a green light to people that place recreation over
wilderness."</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere, perhaps, does that debate play out in more stark and
bitter terms than at the Algodones Dunes.</TE>
<TE>   Hiking across the dunes is a struggle; every step an adventure.
There are two kinds of sand here--hard and soft. Carrying a full pack
and struggling against 40-mph wind gusts, you find yourself praying
for the former. To hedge your bets, you learn quickly to spread your
weight out a bit by walking like a duck--flat-footed, not heel-toe.</TE>
<TE>   The wind spins billowing plumes of sand 50 feet off the lips of
some dunes, and sends dust devils spiraling off others. Many dunes
are sculpted into sheer cliffs, but it's perfectly safe to step
blindly off the edge and then, essentially, hike vertically into
giant, shadowy valleys.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unlike anything I've ever seen," said Andrew M. Harvey, a
Los Angeles-based photographer and one of the hikers.</TE>
<TE>   It's also become a consummate playground for off-roaders, whose
numbers have soared in recent years. Last Thanksgiving weekend,
200,000 off-road riders swarmed the dunes. By the time it was over,
three people were dead and 200 were injured. There had been scores of
crashes, a shooting, a stabbing and an attack on a ranger.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, federal officials announced plans to overturn a
Clinton-era legal settlement banning off-road vehicles on about
50,000 acres of the Algodones Dunes, also known as Imperial Sand
Dunes Recreation Area.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement restrictions were considered temporary until the
U.S. Bureau of Land Management enacted a permanent plan to manage the
site. This new proposal is part of that plan, and conservationists
say it will render the legal settlement moot.</TE>
<TE>   Although the plan won't be final until later this year, after a
series of public hearings, federal officials expect to reopen about
16,000 acres of dunes without limitations and 33,000 acres with
limits on the numbers of off-road vehicles allowed each day.</TE>
<TE>   Those acres would be opened in addition to the roughly 50,000
acres that are open today to off-road vehicles. The northern third of
the dunes, north of California 78 and protected through an act of
Congress more than 15 years ago, will not be affected by the proposal
and will remain off-limits to off-road vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Off-road enthusiasts say the arguments for keeping the 50,000-acre
chunk protected by the November 2000 settlement closed for good fall
flat.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the lawsuit that prompted the November 2000 closure
was based largely on a perceived threat to Peirson's milk vetch, an
endangered plant whose seed pods rattle in the breeze. The plant
grows only in the Imperial Valley desert. It is one item on a
three-page, single-spaced list of "endemic species" the Center for
Biological Diversity has compiled.</TE>
<TE>   Off-roaders, however, call the plant far from unique to the dunes,
saying it has been spotted in Mexico and New Mexico. Moreover, they
say they work hard to protect the plant because a high-speed
encounter with a bush can devastate expensive wheels and other
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like we say, 'Oh, my God, I don't want to hit a plant,
because I want to save the planet.' But you're going to mess up your
vehicle," said William Tranzow, 34, a Los Angeles-area law
enforcement officer who frequently rides off-road vehicles in the
dunes. "So we don't want to run them over."</TE>
<TE>   The Center for Biological Diversity led last weekend's trek
largely to demonstrate that the dunes are a hikers' paradise. But the
reality is that, especially during warmer months, the dunes are a
relatively forbidding place to all but the most dedicated hikers. Few
expect it to become a day-hikers' paradise.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been going out there since 1984, and I've never seen a
hiker, other than someone who is walking because their ATV broke
down," Tranzow said. "This is not a hiking issue."</TE>
<TE>   Horn believes it boils down to a difference in taste.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional, old-school environmentalists simply don't like to
hear the roar of a dune buggy in the distance while they camp, nor
the bellowing of a swamp buggy while they fish. And that, Horn said,
is not a legal basis to limit the use of public property.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are arguing about here are fundamentally aesthetic
issues," Horn said. "But in the broader context, trying to close
major pieces of public land on the basis of aesthetic taste is not
going to get you a lot of political traction. So they converted it
into a research and environmental issue."</TE>
<TE>   Put another way, Tranzow said: "Nobody cares about the Peirson's
milk vetch. And nobody runs over the Peirson's milk vetch because
nobody wants to pop their tires. Peirson's milk vetch is not curing
cancer. It's just another loophole that environmentalists are using
to close down public land."</TE>
<TE>   Back in the desert, the Center for Biological Diversity's
Patterson stood among towering dunes, shaking his head in dismay.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't just the trash he found during his two-day hike--a
flip-flop and a beer can sandblasted into a dull gray. The group
walked through areas where off-road vehicles are banned but found,
among other things, tire tracks and a hard plastic chunk of a
long-forgotten motorcycle radiator.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, his group stopped at the boundary between protected
dunes and unprotected dunes. The contrast was staggering. The
protected dunes were dotted with a variety of vegetation, all homes
for dozens of rare animals. The flat-tailed horned lizard, for
example, survives and finds moisture by scurrying from plant to
plant.</TE>
<TE>   The unprotected dunes were bare--"burnt ground," Patterson said.</TE>
<TE>   On a metal tube left behind by World War II-era military
exercises--also in an area where vehicles are not allowed--Patterson
found a sticker advertising the American Sand Assn., one of the top
lobbying arms representing the interests of off-roaders.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be taking this," Patterson said with a wry smile, ripping
off the sticker and stuffing it in his pocket. "These supposed
law-and-order types drove out and put this here."</TE>
<TE>   Patterson stressed that the environmental movement has no plans to
try to close the dunes to off-roaders altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big place," he said. "There is room for off-roaders. And
there is room for conservation. But we don't need to sacrifice the
whole place for one industry. We didn't work this hard to stand
around and watch the whole thing get scrapped for politics."</TE>

<HD>For Fans, a Ford Is a Forever Kind of Thing</HD>
<DH>Autos: In Buena Park, 20,000 buffs admire 1,800 cars and
trucks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a celebration of Ford Motor Co.'s history, thousands of automobile
enthusiasts flocked to Buena Park on Sunday to show off or gawk at
their favorite Ford car or truck, from antique Model Ts to
limited-edition Mustangs due out next year.</LD>
<LD>   The 17th annual Fabulous Fords Forever car show, which has become
one of the largest events of its kind in the country, drew an
estimated crowd of more than 20,000, organizers said.</LD>
<LD>   Held in a dirt-and-grass lot across from Knott's Berry Farm, the
free event was a virtual outdoor museum for Ford owners and fans,
some of whom traveled from as far as Michigan to check out the
display of 1,800 cars and trucks.</LD>
<TE>   Filling the lot were Model Ts, Model A's, early Ford V-8s, 117
Thunderbirds, 737 Mustangs, pickups, Broncos and an assortment of
Lincolns and Mercury Cougars. The vehicles came from eight states and
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Among the biggest attractions were 49 Shelby Cobras, including the
1962 original that was designed, built and is still owned by Carroll
Shelby, the entrepreneur, auto designer and former racer who was a
special guest of the event.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to come to this because it's the biggest Ford event of the
year," Shelby said. "All motor-vehicle companies realize events like
these are needed to attract younger buyers."</TE>
<TE>   Shelby, 79, of Los Angeles, said he has produced 150,000 cars and
100 models during his career, including the Mustang GT-350 and
GT-500. He still makes 200 Cobras a year under his own name. The
classic design, which combines a powerful eight-cylinder engine with
the body of a British roadster, has not changed much over the years.</TE>
<TE>   A centerpiece of the show was a 2003 Mustang Mach 1, a special
edition with upholstery and instrumentation reminiscent of the
original Mach 1, built from 1969 to 1973. Compared to the earlier
version, the car has more horsepower and a hood that exposes the
engine's air scoop. Ford expects to make less than 7,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mach 1 was a car legendary in its time," said John Coletti,
chief engineer for Ford Special Vehicles and a designer of the latest
Mach 1. "Mustangers really connect with the car, and we try to
connect with them.... You really feed the psyche of an enthusiast
with a specialty car. You keep giving them something to talk about."</TE>
<TE>   For some enthusiasts, like Stan Fuller of Long Beach, the show
gave them a chance to connect with the past. Fuller owns a Model T.
The retired mechanic restored his and drives it whenever he can. It
was made in 1927, the last year the Model T was made and the year
Fuller was born.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as old as I am and it's in better condition," he joked.</TE>

<HD>Bought Home, Selling Castle</HD>
<DH>Housing: Ventura County real estate prices have soared in
the last two months. With buyers lining up, bidding wars return.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Flush with a $95,000 profit from a Los Angeles County home, Mike
Riach thought he'd have no trouble finding a house he could afford in
Ventura County.</LD>
<LD>   But the 33-year-old firefighter lost out on a full-price offer in
Ventura. Then he found that just about anything in his price range
was sold by the time he saw it.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, after months of hunting, Riach and his wife, Suzie, got
lucky in a lottery-type sale in Camarillo and bought the last model
home in a new subdivision for $340,000. Eighty people had signed a
waiting list for the opportunity.</LD>
<TE>   "They called out our name and my wife jumped up screaming," he
said. The victory will cost the Riaches 44% of their take-home income
each month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's $100,000 more than I wanted to spend; just way too much,"
Riach said. "But it's really good for today's market. It's amazing
what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   In the last two months, Ventura County's scorching housing market
has gotten so hot that some veteran agents say it matches or
surpasses the real estate run-ups of the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Bidding wars are back, agents say. Some owners sell their own
homes without an agent in days. And even houses priced above the
perceived market are regularly fetching more than owners are asking.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost as if somebody flipped a switch in late January, and
everybody came out in droves," said Ventura agent Harold Powell. "In
the last month we've had multiple offers on four or five properties.
Three of them have sold over the asking price."</TE>
<TE>   Those houses sold for $285,000 to $500,000, he said. A year or two
ago, they would have cost $50,000 to $100,000 less.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County, a commuter haven for San Fernando Valley workers
for decades, is now also seen as an affordable alternative for
professionals who work in the pricey coastal enclaves of Los Angeles
and Santa Barbara counties.</TE>
<TE>   Broker Mike Glickman, the onetime golden boy of San Fernando
Valley real estate, began his move into Ventura County a year ago to
catch what he said is the strongest market he seen since entering the
business in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a gold rush out here," he said. "There's nothing to compare
to the frenzy going on in Ventura County right now."</TE>
<TE>   Glickman said he personally sells a house a day in this county,
about one-third of his total in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the Spanish-style home Jill and Matthew Clark bought for
$390,000 in the lower Ventura hills in June. Two weeks ago, they sold
the same 1,600-square-foot bungalow on a postage-stamp lot for
$460,000. That's a cool $70,000 bump in 10 months.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen people called the first day, and the house sold by
nightfall.</TE>
<TE>   "Even the Realtors were shocked at how quickly it went," Jill
Clark said. "It's a very hot market in this moderate price range."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Evans, the agent who listed the Clark home, said Santa
Barbara's prices, especially, have sent young couples southward to
Ventura and Oxnard looking for deals. An older Spanish home with a
view can cost $800,000 to $900,000 in Santa Barbara, he said, but
$500,000 in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates are that 20,000 Santa Barbara County workers commute
from west Ventura County each day, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lived here 32 years, and I've never seen anything like
this," Evans said. "They'll drive 45 minutes each way to save
$300,000 on a house. Every time we sell a house, we'll raise the next
price $10,000 or $15,000 for the same neighborhood, and it still
sells. Sometimes in a day or two at full price."</TE>
<TE>   Countywide home sales figures for February, the most recent
available, were up 36% from the year before and far outpaced those
for the same month in 1988 and 1989. The median price soared from
$253,000 in February 2001 to $303,000 a year later.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got sales numbers we wouldn't normally see until summer,"
said John Karevoll, analyst for DataQuick Information Systems of La
Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   DataQuick's figures are based on closed escrows and generally
reflect deals reached in January. A west county Realtors' group,
which counts escrows when they open, reported that March sales were
up 41% over February and that the median price for the nearly 500
single-family homes on the market is about $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Agents say prices and competition for homes have only increased in
recent weeks as buyers have tried to beat twin bugaboos--rising
prices and mortgage interest rates hikes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very unusual market," said Karen Campbell, president of
the Ventura County Coastal Assn. of Realtors, which represents agents
from six cities in the west county.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago in Ventura, for example, only about 80 houses and
condos were for sale, far fewer than usual. About 100 more were on
the market in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing to sell," she said, "so prices are continually
going up. There are five buyers for every house, so you're going to
have bidding wars."</TE>
<TE>   It's purely a seller's market, and that's not good, Campbell said,
because it prices the young, the old and even middle-income couples
out of the market.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks agent Jim Keith said he saw the problem recently.</TE>
<TE>   A woman shopping for a Thousand Oaks condo agreed to pay $167,000
for 900 square feet of living space, $2,000 higher than the asking
price. But the deal fell through, and a few days later an identical
model was listed for $172,500 and had six offers, including five that
were above the asking price.</TE>
<TE>   Keith said he called about another condo in Simi Valley listed at
$174,500. But it already had five offers pending. Keith's buyer
decided not to compete in such a volatile market.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Greer, president of the Conejo Valley Assn. of Realtors,
said the housing supply is far below demand in the Thousand Oaks area
even though there are about 1,000 listings between Agoura Hills and
Newbury Park.</TE>
<TE>   "The last three I did all sold within 10 days for very close to if
not the full asking price," he said. "They were all $300,000 to
$400,000, which is really our best market."</TE>
<TE>   There are those who think the boom of the last year can't last,
and they fear a bubble similar to the one that burst in 1989, cutting
20% off the value of a typical Ventura County house.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what's happening," said association president Campbell, a
Ventura agent. "I bought a condo in '82 for $99,000, and it was worth
$170,000 in the late '80s. Four years after that, it was worth
$99,000 again, and then we sold it two years ago for $174,000. We're
on top now. But I'm waiting to see where we are going from here."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Campbell has invested in the strong new market herself. After
languishing on a waiting list to buy a new house in a central Ventura
subdivision for months, she bought a home in a new tract in east
Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   "The builder called and said, 'Do you want this house or not? If
you don't, I've got people waiting behind you,'" she said.</TE>
<TE>   She bought the 3,028-square-foot home for $460,000. Since then,
the builder has opened a fifth phase of the same project.</TE>
<TE>   "They sold them all in a day and a half, for more than I paid,"
Campbell said. "So it already looks like a good deal."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a somber and reflective occasion at Sinai Temple in Los
Angeles on Sunday as a standing-room crowd gathered to remember the
horrors of the past during a time of tumult in Israel.</LD>
<LD>   Holocaust Remembrance Day was marked at this Westside synagogue by
an observance featuring a string of influential speakers, including
former Middle East envoy Dennis Ross, Mayor James K. Hahn and Gov.
Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   The temple shook with standing ovations when speakers drew
parallels between the Holocaust and the current struggles in the
Middle East.</LD>
<TE>   "We must remember the Holocaust in all its barbaric details,"
Davis said. "We must not shrink from it, and we must summon up the
outrage to prevent history from repeating itself."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said Americans and Israelis share a bond of common ideals,
and he declared his "support for the state of Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said this year's event was more important than ever, not only
because it occurred during a backdrop of conflict but also because he
was worried that violence against Jews was on the rise.</TE>
<TE>   "We see anti-Semitism very strong again in Europe ... and even
right here in Los Angeles," said Hahn, noting that police are
investigating a recent assault against Jewish students. It's "so
important that we come together to remember how awful the Holocaust
was. The problem still continues."</TE>
<TE>   The day had a particularly deep resonance for the many Holocaust
survivors among the crowd of roughly 2,000. They spoke of the pain
conjured up by recent events.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a most difficult time," said Samuel Goetz, a 73-year-old
who was liberated from a Nazi concentration camp when he was 16. "We
are remembering the struggles we have gone through, and that is
painful enough. But we are also looking for reason for optimism with
what is happening in Israel, and that is a difficult thing to find
these days."</TE>
<TE>   The event took place under extremely tight security, with dozens
of Los Angeles police restricting access to the area surrounding the
temple, located on Wilshire Boulevard. The atmosphere was tense.
Concrete barriers lined the streets and metal detectors were used on
those entering the event.</TE>

<HD>Aloft, in His Grandfather's Spirit</HD>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>In hopes of replicating his grandfather's historic 1927 flight across
the Atlantic and boosting interest in civilian aviation, Erik
Lindbergh took off Sunday in a plane dubbed "The New Spirit of St.
Louis."</LD>
<LD>   Lindbergh, 37, an artist and executive with the St. Louis-based X
Prize Foundation, taxied alone down the runway at an airport named
for his grandfather in a state-of-the-art single-engine Lancair
Columbia 300.</LD>
<LD>   "This flight is all about celebration of the past and hope for the
future," Lindbergh said.</LD>
<TE>   He touched down Sunday evening in St. Louis, en route to Long
Island, N.Y., and finally a May 1 departure for Paris.</TE>
<TE>   He wants to drum up interest for the high-stakes competition being
staged by the nonprofit X Prize Foundation, dedicated to promoting
science research and civilian space travel.</TE>
<TE>   With heavy corporate sponsorship, the foundation is offering $10
million to the first group that can build an aircraft capable of
sending three adults 62.5 miles into space and bringing them back
safely, and then repeating the feat within two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Charles Lindbergh's flight changed the public's mind-set about
aviation," said X Prize Foundation Chairman Peter H. Diamandis. "We
want the same from Erik--for people to say, 'Hey, there's no reason
space travel is just for government employees or wealthy
millionaires.'"</TE>
<TE>   Competitions have long been part of aviation. Charles Lindbergh
was motivated by a $25,000 prize being offered for the first nonstop
New York-France flight.</TE>
<TE>   Lean and self-deprecating in the manner of his famous relative,
Erik Lindbergh has another reason for attempting the flight: to raise
awareness about rheumatoid arthritis.</TE>
<TE>   A star gymnast as a teenager, Lindbergh was diagnosed with
arthritis in his early 20s and soon could barely walk without canes.
But now with new medication and a devotion to exercise and diet, he
shows few effects of the crippling condition.</TE>
<TE>   "This mission is also about the future of medicine," he said.
"It's about overcoming obstacles and [about] perseverance."</TE>
<TE>   That the flight should start in San Diego is historically proper.
Although the money to back Charles Lindbergh's flight came from St.
Louis--hence the name of his plane--the expertise and determination
came from San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   A financially struggling company called Ryan Airlines built his
single-engine monoplane on a shoestring budget and without
blueprints. A full-size replica resides in the rotunda of the San
Diego Aerospace Museum in Balboa Park.</TE>
<TE>   At an average cruising speed of 184 mph, Erik Lindbergh estimates
that his 3,600-mile Long Island-to-Paris leg of the flight will take
about 18 hours. At 108 mph, his grandfather took 33 1/2 hours in the
original Spirit.</TE>
<TE>   The all-composite Lancair has a satellite phone and Global
Positioning System technology--a far cry from the submarine-like
periscope that Ryan designers put in the original Spirit to overcome
the fact that an oversized fuel tank blocked his view.</TE>
<TE>   Bend, Ore.-based Lancair Co. wants to gain a niche in the private
market as a faster (maximum cruise speed of 219 mph) but less
expensive ($325,000) alternative to better-known brands.</TE>
<TE>   Erik Lindbergh said he remembers little of his grandfather--who
died in 1974--except that he was reluctant to talk about the flight
that had made him internationally famous.</TE>
<TE>   "If anyone in the family asked him about the actual flight, he
would say, 'Read the book,'" his grandson said. "I knew there was
something different about him, but I'm still learning about how he
and my grandmother [Anne Morrow Lindbergh] affected the world."</TE>
<TE>   Although solo trips across the Atlantic are not unusual, the
effort still remains "the Mt. Everest" of civilian aviation,
Diamandis said, because of the distance and the fact that most of the
trip is over water.</TE>
<TE>   Lindbergh's plane has a life raft, but--like his grandfather--he
decided not to take a parachute. He plans to cruise at about 11,000
feet; Charles Lindbergh got so close to the waves that sea-spray hit
his face.</TE>
<TE>   Although aviation has changed greatly in the 75 years since
Charles Lindbergh made the world's first solo flight across the
Atlantic, one factor remains as important as ever: luck.</TE>
<TE>   Erik Lindbergh figures he has something that will work as a good
luck charm: a Swiss Army knife given to him by his grandfather.</TE>
<TE>   "Very little of their effects are still with the family," he said.
"They donated most of their things to museums."</TE>

<HD>State High Court to Rule on Jail Phone Taps</HD>
<DH>Law: In a debate that goes back to the 1970s, panel will
decide whether prosecutors can eavesdrop on inmates' conversations to
gather criminal evidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutor Thomas Rogers was convinced that Christine Loyd had killed
her mother out of greed. But he lacked enough evidence to charge the
Bay Area woman, who was already in jail in another murder case.</LD>
<LD>   Rogers solved the problem by taping calls Loyd made from jail. The
tapes were played to the jury that convicted her.</LD>
<LD>   The California Supreme Court will soon decide whether
eavesdropping by prosecutors on conversations between inmates and
their family and friends is permissible for gathering criminal
evidence.</LD>
<TE>   The legal debate over tapping jail phones for evidence without a
court order goes back to the 1970s case of newspaper heiress Patricia
Hearst, in which authorities recorded a conversation she had with a
jail visitor and used it against her during her trial for bank
robbery.</TE>
<TE>   The state high court, then presided over by liberal Chief Justice
Rose Bird, ruled in 1982 that the taping of inmates' calls and visits
with family and friends was illegal if done for prosecutorial
purposes. Calls could be monitored only for penal security--to
prevent escapes, for example, the court ruled.</TE>
<TE>   The court, now dominated by moderate to conservative Republicans,
will decide in the next several weeks whether to overrule the
precedent, and if not, whether prosecutors should be sanctioned for
violating it.</TE>
<TE>   A state Court of Appeal that considered the Loyd case in 2000
castigated Rogers, the Alameda County assistant district attorney.
But Rogers, who the court said committed misconduct, insists the
practice is widespread in California jails.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't a cowboy going off and doing something that was
completely unusual or out of line," Rogers said. "It was an accepted
practice by the courts, the judges and other prosecutors in my
office."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Chief Deputy Public Defender Michael McMahon agrees
that county prosecutors eavesdrop on inmates' telephone calls on
occasion, but says the high court should stop the practice.</TE>
<TE>   "The system could profit from a little bit of ethical behavior on
the part of prosecutors," said McMahon, who represents the state
Public Defender Assn. in the Loyd litigation.</TE>
<TE>   The Bay Area murder case has reached the state's highest court at
a time of increasing debate over government efforts to listen in on
inmates' conversations. The federal government recently granted law
enforcement officers limited authority to listen to inmates'
conversations with their lawyers in cases of suspected terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Although California will continue to bar officers from
eavesdropping on lawyer-client conversations, prosecutors say inmates
deserve no such privacy when they are talking to friends and family.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think there is anybody around here who would like to see
the people of Al Qaeda have the right to make private phone calls to
their associates on the outside?" asked Mark Hutchins, an Oakland
prosecutor who represents the California District Attorneys Assn. in
the state Supreme Court case. "I think most people would say no. Lots
of prisoners in California are just as dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   Rogers said he ordered the taping of Loyd's calls because he
needed evidence to charge her with the slaying of her mother, Myrtle
Loyd. The 1991 death of the Oakland woman, who was found in her
bathtub, had initially been classified an accident.</TE>
<TE>   Christine Loyd, 57, worked for years as a manager of a medical
insurance company. Divorced with no children, Loyd lived in an
upper-middle-class home her parents had helped her buy in Contra
Costa County, east of San Francisco. She had no criminal record or
history of psychiatric problems, Rogers said.</TE>
<TE>   At the time Loyd made the incriminating phone call, she already
was in an Alameda County jail on charges that she killed Virginia
Baily, 59, a Berkeley vitamin saleswoman whose finances Loyd had
offered to manage and whose money prosecutors said she stole.</TE>
<TE>   Baily was dead a year and a half before there was enough evidence
to charge Loyd. Baily's body had been badly burned in a 1994 fire at
her downtown Berkeley home, but an autopsy revealed the presence of
maggots, indicating she had died before the fire. Loyd had purchased
two 40-ounce cans of lighter fluid and a hose days earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors Learn of Mother's Death</TE>
<TE>   While preparing to prosecute the Baily slaying, Rogers learned
that Loyd's mother had died in what was classified as an accident
three years before Baily's death. Myrtle, 76, was found dead in her
bathtub with six lacerations on her head.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought this was odd," Rogers recalled. "So I checked [Loyd's]
financial status. Did she have money problems?"</TE>
<TE>   Rogers said Loyd had not made payments on her house during the
months before her mother's death. He said he saw a red flag when he
learned it was Loyd who had discovered the body.</TE>
<TE>   Loyd told police she found her mother when bringing groceries to
her apartment near Lake Merritt. Loyd said she tried but failed to
lift the body out of the tub and drained the water.</TE>
<TE>   The autopsy found that the lacerations on Myrtle Loyd's head were
caused by a long, heavy instrument. One of Myrtle Loyd's fingers had
been dislocated, and there were bruises on her hand. These injuries
were consistent with defensive wounds, the coroner's office
determined.</TE>
<TE>   The office alerted homicide detectives, but the case was
eventually closed. The death was classified as an accident due to
blunt trauma.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers says he believed that Loyd, who received her mother's
$100,000 annuity, had killed out of greed. But he had only
circumstantial evidence. The mother and daughter, by all accounts,
had been on good terms.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard people say that they spoiled their children, and the
children ended up hating them," Rogers said. "I think that is what
happened. I think the daughter was very spoiled and desperate not to
lose her house and had no source of income."</TE>
<TE>   Loyd's attorney did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers obtained the evidence he needed when Loyd telephoned her
brother from jail. Her brother, who prosecutors said was not involved
in the murder, believed in his sister's innocence, Rogers said.</TE>
<TE>   Taped Phone Call Helped Get Conviction</TE>
<TE>   Rogers played part of the tape at Loyd's trial in the two
slayings, and it appeared to imply that Loyd was trying to pin her
mother's killing on her mother's hairdresser.</TE>
<TE>   "The tapes permitted the prosecutor to play conversations between
defendant and her brother in which they seemed to be concocting
patently false scenarios to explain away the defendant's opportunity
to commit the crime," wrote Justice Marcel B. Poche of the 1st
District Court of Appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "The tapes also permitted the prosecutor to suggest that Myrtle
Loyd's death was initially treated as an accident in large measure
because the defendant was a convincing liar who manipulated a lazy
police officer into accepting her false tale of accidental death,"
continued Poche, who dissented in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Loyd was convicted of both killings and sentenced to 55 years to
life in prison. The Court of Appeal upheld the convictions 2 to 1,
but all three justices on the panel agreed that Rogers had committed
misconduct by tapping Loyd's telephone calls in jail.</TE>
<TE>   In an opinion written by Justice Patricia K. Sepulveda, the
majority said Rogers had defied the California Supreme Court's ruling
against such wiretapping but had not violated Loyd's federal
constitutional rights.</TE>
<TE>   "We emphatically condemn this behavior," Sepulveda wrote. "All
attorneys are officers of the court, and the plain holdings of the
Supreme Court may not be simply ignored by any attorney, least of all
the public prosecutor, who is entrusted with the power and charged
with the duty to vindicate the rule of law against those who would
disregard it."</TE>
<TE>   Poche argued in his dissent that the prosecutorial misconduct
warranted overturning Loyd's conviction for killing her mother.</TE>
<TE>   "By using the illicit jailhouse tape of defendant's conversation
with Philip Loyd, the prosecutor effectively bolstered what was a
purely circumstantial case with statements from the mouth of
defendant herself," Poche wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In accepting the case, the California Supreme Court said it would
consider whether the trial court erred by not dismissing the case or
recusing the prosecutor for misconduct. The high court could also
find the taping proper or rule it improper but not egregious enough
to have affected the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   At issue in People vs. Loyd, S092653, is the 1982 ruling by the
state high court that barred prosecutors from using jailhouse tapes
of conversations between inmates and family. That ruling was
triggered by the trial of Hearst.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst Told Visitor About Crimes</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Tobin, a friend of Hearst, had visited her in jail when
she was awaiting trial on charges that she robbed a bank with other
members of the Symbionese Liberation Army. The radical group had
kidnapped the heiress from her Berkeley apartment in 1974 and she
later joined them in committing several crimes.</TE>
<TE>   In a conversation that was taped and played at the trial, Hearst
told her friend that she hoped to make a statement from a
revolutionary feminist perspective and confided that "my politics are
really different" from what they were when the SLA abducted her.</TE>
<TE>   Federal courts upheld the admissibility of the tape, but the
California Supreme Court, in a separate lawsuit, later said state
prosecutors had no legal right to invade inmates' privacy in such a
way.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say the 1982 ruling is outdated and should be
overturned, and Rogers' taping should be approved.</TE>
<TE>   The appellate court "lambasted Tom Rogers for doing this, when the
average person would say what a great job he did," said Hutchins,
senior deputy district attorney of Alameda County. "He saw the
similarity between the two crimes and figured out how to get the
goods on her on the murder of her mother."</TE>
<TE>   Rogers could have sought a warrant from a judge to wiretap Loyd,
Hutchins said, but "getting a warrant is very cumbersome."</TE>
<TE>   Rogers said he may not have had enough evidence at the time to
persuade a judge to grant a wiretapping warrant under the legal
standard of probable cause.</TE>
<TE>   Alan L. Schlosser, who wrote a brief on behalf of Loyd for the
American Civil Liberties Union, countered that inmates should have
privacy when talking with family and friends on intimate matters. He
said the taping violated Loyd's federal constitutional right to due
process.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people are in jail because they can't make bail," Schlosser
said. "You can't cavalierly take the position that you don't have any
constitutional rights in jail."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura Deputy Public Defender McMahon said the California Supreme
Court must find a way to punish prosecutors who violate the 1982
precedent.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't come up with a remedy for these intentional, illegal
activities by government officials, it is almost the equivalent of
condoning it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers has been a prosecutor for more than 25 years. He has never
before been cited for misconduct and wants the state high court to
clear his name. "I was just another prosecutor doing what every other
prosecutor was doing across the state," Rogers said.</TE>

<HD>Foes Block School's Parking Structure Plan</HD>
<DH>Construction: Newport Beach neighbors also don't like
expansion effort by church, which would share in the use.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A proposal to build a parking structure at a Newport Beach high
school is on hold after a series of public meetings dominated by
angry residents opposed to it and a related church expansion plan.</LD>
<LD>   "Parking structures are security risks," fumed Kathy Stuart, who
lives near Newport Harbor High School, where the structure is
proposed. "They attract the partyers and the perverts, they are not
appropriate for residential areas and they're just plain ugly."</LD>
<LD>   Neighbor Michael O'Donnell is equally opposed: "This is not an
alternative and I don't think it should happen."</LD>
<TE>   At first blush, school officials say, the project seemed like the
perfect solution to a daunting problem. Like many California schools,
Newport Harbor High has endured a parking crunch as more students
drive to school.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, administrators received a compelling offer from St.
Andrews Presbyterian Church directly across the street: Build the
two- or three-level parking structure on campus, church officials
said, and the congregation will help cover the cost if it can also
use the space.</TE>
<TE>   It's actually the church's plan to expand on its own grounds,
which helped prompt its offer to the school, that appears to be the
major irritant to neighbors opposed to the parking structure. They
see problems with crowding and a burdensome church-school connection.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue for us is that it's a big campus with inadequate
parking," said Michael Fine, the Newport-Mesa Unified School
District's assistant superintendent for business services. "The
church said it was willing to write a big check."</TE>
<TE>   Because of budget constraints, said Duwayne Brooks, director of
school facilities for the California Department of Education, more
schools rely on construction and operating agreements with outside
parties to defray costs. And a shortage of big parcels, along with
more student drivers have prompted many districts building schools to
include parking structures in their designs.</TE>
<TE>   "It just gets worse every year," Brooks said. "Thirty years ago,
most families had just one car. Now how many do they have?"</TE>
<TE>   Brooks said he doesn't know of any schools in California with
parking structures that were not included in their original designs.</TE>
<TE>   St. Andrews made its overture to the school in November.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it would help some of the parking and traffic problems
that exist in the neighborhood," said Herb Smith, the church's
business administrator. "It's been an issue for years and, for some
reason, the parties haven't gotten together to talk about solving
it."</TE>
<TE>   What put the proposed parking structure on the church's immediate
agenda, Smith said, was its own expansion plan, which calls for
adding about 30,000 square feet to its family center over the next
four years. And that could require more parking. The school's parking
structure--which would cost the church and the school a total of
about $8 million for three levels--would add 570 spaces to the
school's existing 397.</TE>
<TE>   "We are purely in the conceptual stages," Smith said, adding that
the city had given preliminary approval to the church's expansion.</TE>
<TE>   In three public meetings at the high school last week, neighbors
decried the church's plans.</TE>
<TE>   "The school should be separated from the church," said resident
Monica Mazur. "Perhaps the church has outgrown the neighborhood. If
it needs a bigger area, perhaps it should move."</TE>
<TE>   Said Terry Butros: "What we have in front of us is a project
brought by a private enterprise as part of its plan to expand. It
steps all over the school district and the citizenry."</TE>
<TE>   Fine, the assistant school superintendent, said the neighborhood
opposition prompted him to cancel two more public meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to stop here," he said, "and ask the church to work
with its community some more. Clearly, people are upset with them,
and I think the church has to do some community engagement before
things go any further."</TE>

<HD>Code Rulings Unfair, Rural Residents Say</HD>
<DH>Enforcement: Orange County canyon dwellers complain they're
held to building, land-use laws, but commercial projects aren't.
Officials deny it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As suburbia spreads to Orange County's canyons, longtime residents
say a double standard is being applied by county code officials and
politicians in their neck of the woods.</LD>
<LD>   While owners of small homes in Modjeska, Silverado and other
canyons have faced an enforcement crackdown on building and land-use
regulations, major commercial ventures build and operate at will
without permits, residents say.</LD>
<LD>   For instance, 70-year-old retiree Claude Franklin has been cited
twice by code enforcement officials for keeping chickens in
"unsightly" sheds.</LD>
<TE>   But a large motocross track was built without grading permits or
environmental approvals in the dry bed of Irvine Lake last summer,
and has stayed open long after a temporary use permit expired,
despite complaints by area activists. And one area couple held up to
four weddings a week in their backyard at $5,000 per event, without
permits, although neighbors complained repeatedly about traffic,
noise and other problems. Thomas B. Mathews, director of the county's
Planning and Development Services Department, insisted there is no
double standard. Tough zoning codes regulate chicken coops, for
instance, he said. As for the weddings, he said he didn't want to
cancel long-scheduled ceremonies while the couple sought required
permits.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel sorry for Claude Franklin, but we don't get to choose what
we enforce," agreed Planning Department spokesman Brian Murphy, who
said Franklin's case still was being studied for a possible
compromise.</TE>
<TE>   The real difference, Murphy said, is that larger applicants can
afford to hire attorneys to fight planning decisions. That doesn't
equate to favoritism, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Is Major Spitzer Contributor</TE>
<TE>   But critics note that Stephen Sheldon, an attorney for both the
wedding organizers and the motocross operators, is a campaign
contributor to Supervisor Todd Spitzer, and Spitzer and his staff
intervened repeatedly in county efforts to require permits at both
sites.</TE>
<TE>   Sheldon was Spitzer's largest single individual contributor last
year, donating $3,000 on Nov. 24 to his bid for the 71st Assembly
seat, a state race not subject to county campaign finance caps. A
former staffer of Spitzer's also was hired by both projects to
prepare engineering reports.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a clear example of the buddy-buddy money game," said
Sherry Meddick, a resident of Silverado Canyon and an outspoken
activist. "It's special rules for special people."</TE>
<TE>   Sheldon denied any link between his backing of Spitzer and the
code enforcement issues.</TE>
<TE>   "There is absolutely no connection between who my wife and I
support because of our political convictions, and my clients," he
said. "Frankly, I'm offended."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, a former county prosecutor who represents the rural
areas, denied showing political favoritism. He said he follows the
law "to a tee" and considers every project on its merits. He and his
staff were involved because both projects were in his district and
because he has been actively involved in zoning matters, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said he questioned Sheldon about the wedding site at a
recent supervisor's meeting, then voted against a permit for the
couple to continue holding weddings, citing noise, drainage, an
overloaded septic system and other concerns.</TE>
<TE>   But neighbors say it took nearly two years to reach that point.</TE>
<TE>   As for the motocross track, county planning documents show that
Spitzer or his staff have questioned an October ruling by Mathews
saying the track was operating illegally, and had long conversations
with Sheldon about it. Spitzer's involvement is the reason the track
has stayed open after its temporary use permit expired in February,
records and interviews show.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said his actions are unrelated to Sheldon. He said he
personally likes motocross and felt that the operators, Saddleback
Motorsports Partners, were young small-business owners who had been
misled by the Serrano Water District, which leased them the site and
told them a decades-old general recreation permit for the property
was all that was necessary. He also noted that hundreds of motocross
users had phoned and e-mailed his office when the course was
temporarily closed in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Etter, co-owner of the track, said he and his partners hired
Sheldon, a land-use attorney, based on a recommendation from a law
school friend.</TE>
<TE>   Etter said suggestions that they were a large, politically
connected business were off base.</TE>
<TE>   "I think of us as a small, mom-and-pop recreational activity,"
said Etter, an estate tax attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Motocross Operators Must Get Permits</TE>
<TE>   David Noyes, general manager of the water district, said the
motocross operators were not misled. He believes the old permit is
sufficient, but that if additional permits were required, it is the
track operators' responsibility to get them.</TE>
<TE>   Sheldon said he went to Spitzer's office because he wanted the
matter brought before the Board of Supervisors, which can overturn
some planning decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Mathews issued a temporary use permit allowing the track to reopen
last November, based on Sheldon's assurance that all necessary
federal permits had been obtained. After a U.S. Fish and Wildlife
official notified the county that that was not true, Sheldon said he
had been relying on a prior permit.</TE>
<TE>   Mathews said he stands by his decision that up-to-date county
permits are needed, but that he had no problem with having the
question considered by the Board of Supervisors. He said operators
have submitted a grading and erosion-control plan, answering his most
immediate concerns. He has held off on shutting down the site or
taking any other action since Spitzer placed it on the agenda for
discussion in February. Since then the item has been postponed twice.</TE>
<TE>   Mathews said many of the complaints from residents about unfair
treatment simply mean that suburban norms are finally reaching the
county's fiercely independent rural areas, known as "the canyons"
because they are nestled in the Santa Ana Mountains. Many people
there have long practiced "the canyon way," waiting for a three-day
weekend to install a new septic tank without a permit, or
surreptitiously adding a second story to a home.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent years, complaints from new neighbors have grown, and
code officials say they have increased oversight.</TE>
<TE>   "Our stepped-up enforcement is all intended, first and foremost,
to educate the people that even though they live in the rural areas,
there are requirements that apply to everyone," Mathews said.
"Remember, this entire thing is complaint-driven," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin, the chicken farmer, says a Newport Beach man bought the
land next door and decided he wanted things "cleaned up." The
neighbor could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin, who has owned his land for 30 years and has gardened and
raised chickens on it for the last decade, was cited last year for
having illegal sheds. He appealed, and a hearing officer agreed the
land was zoned for agricultural use. He said he was told all he
needed to do was move a trailer off the property.</TE>
<TE>   But within months, a code enforcement officer issued another
citation over the sheds.</TE>
<TE>   "I called them up and said, 'You boneheads, doesn't the left hand
know what the right is doing?'" Franklin said.</TE>
<TE>   Planning Department spokesman Murphy said the arbitrator did
largely agree with Franklin, but that code enforcement officials
later determined that large sheds still were not allowed.</TE>
<TE>   "The man is not being hassled over the long run," Murphy said.
"There are relatively minor problems. We're just asking him to fix
them."</TE>
<TE>   But neighbor Dana Judd disagreed. "We're talking about a couple of
chicken sheds, for god's sake," said Judd, adding that allowing the
commercial weddings to continue without permits for months in someone
else's backyard while citing Franklin was unfair. "We are just
horrified at the difference in two sets of law. What is going on
here?"</TE>

<TE>   Enforcement Based on Phoned-In Complaints</TE>
<TE>   He added that all of the enforcement was based on calls from
residents. "Remember, this entire thing is complaint-driven," he
said.</TE>

<TE>   Franklin, an advocate of the old ways, believes neither he nor
anyone should have to bother with permits. That includes the
Motocross track operators and wedding planners. . "People should be
allowed to do what they want on their own land," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many disagree, and since the system is complaint-driven, feuds
have developed between neighbors. Some residents are calling
anonymously to "rat" on others, as one woman put it.</TE>
<TE>   Not just newcomers think people should follow the rules for
building properly. Longtime resident Meddick says she fought for
years to have proper grading and safety codes implemented. But, she
says, "the rules should be applied fairly and evenly."</TE>

<LD>Two men on a mission: the energy-blues brothers.</LD>
<LD>   The brotherhood is strictly political. They are two Republican
assemblymen who are burning the midnight filament as they work to
hang the financial fallout from the energy crisis tightly around Gov.
Gray Davis' neck.</LD>
<LD>   To mark the one-year anniversary of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.'s
bankruptcy filing, Moorpark's Tony Strickland and Northridge's Keith
Richman delivered a cake to the governor's office. It was shaped like
a lightbulb and frosted in gray icing--get it? Gray as in the
governor, gray as in "dimouts."</LD>
<TE>   "Last year at the 'State of the State,'" said Strickland, who
co-commissioned the cake, the governor "promised there would be no
bankruptcies, no bailouts and no rate increases--and we got all of
them. Gray Davis might say, 'Let them eat cake.' He's sort of like
Marie Antoinette"--who, as historians have found, was indeed rather a
free-spender but should be acquitted on the cake-quote rap.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's press secretary, Steve Maviglio, parried in keeping
with the cake theme. Deregulation, signed into law under Davis'
predecessor, was "a half-baked idea brought to us by the
Republicans." Thus, perhaps the cake should be trundled off for
chemical analysis. "There might be some secret Enron documents
inside," Maviglio added.</TE>
<TE>   Other great pastry moments in history: In 1986, Reagan National
Security Advisor Robert McFarlane led a secret mission to Tehran to
trade weapons for U.S. hostages. As a goodwill gesture, he carried a
Bible signed by Reagan and a key-shaped cake.</TE>
<TE>   Bush Now a Friend of Bill (No, Not That Bill!)</TE>
<TE>   The White House, which backed the wrong horse by supporting Dick
Riordan in California's Republican gubernatorial primary, is now
kissing and making up.</TE>
<TE>   Both President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney held
a 25-minute chinwag with nominee Bill Simon, the man one Bush player
had called to suggest that he drop out. Just as significantly,
Simon's strategist, Sal Russo, met with Bush's political tactician,
Karl Rove.</TE>
<TE>   By way of making up, Bush will be headlining two fund-raisers for
Simon later this month to dump another $3 million or $4 million into
a campaign fund that is rattling its few forlorn coins compared to
Gray Davis' well-stuffed piggy bank.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also met with four Cabinet secretaries, which is more than
can be said for the state's Republican Party. Some of its loyalists
are still miffed, feeling that the Bush folks have bigfooted
California and snubbed them--the conservative forces that won the
election for Simon.</TE>
<TE>   They like to point out that Bush's top-ops man in California,
Gerald Parsky, has had his moments of friction with Simon, and that
he told that other Times newspaper back in Gotham that Simon's hopes
of winning depend on adopting "the formula I describe" to open the
door to GOP moderates.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has said that the Cabinet secretaries will help him raise
money. But while said secretaries have come to California at least 75
times since Bush was elected, only the agriculture secretary, who is
a California native, has actually appeared at a state Republican
Party event to raise money and morale.</TE>
<TE>   California's Republicans have always had a streak of "we'd rather
be right than president," which has sometimes thwarted Republican
successes here. And there's a sentiment afoot that Parsky--who would
dearly love to haul California into Bush's column after that
million-vote loss to Al Gore--is pushing a "my-way-or-the-highway"
technique to get the state party to knuckle under: no cooperation, no
Cabinet members. Party on!</TE>
<TE>   A Man for All Political Seasons</TE>
<TE>   Got books?</TE>
<TE>   This week is National Library Week, and for the 14th year, a
retired small-town librarian from Maine makes news with her famous
favorites list, the cherished reading material of the nation's
politicians and celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   California's movie figures from the geriatric to the juvenile
answered Glenna Nowell's e-mails. Bob Hope cited "Huckleberry Finn."
The 14-year-old actor Haley Joel Osment favored a Michael Crichton
novel and the seminal Gettysburg account, "Killer Angels."</TE>
<TE>   For political pop psychologists, the choicest choice was Gov. Gray
Davis. He e-mailed Nowell that he is reading "John Adams," David
McCullough's biography of the second president. Davis' all-time
favorite book: Robert Bolt's book about England's sainted statesman,
Sir Thomas More--"A Man for All Seasons."</TE>
<TE>   Campaign's a Bust--and So Is Bank Account</TE>
<TE>   First a political belly-flop, now a financial belly-up.</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove GOPster Jeff Chavez, nominated in March to stand up
to the plate and take on Democratic Rep. Loretta Sanchez, then did
the unthinkable: He quit the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Personal reasons, he said.</TE>
<TE>   And now it appears he is walking away from more than just a life
in politics. In a letter to vendors--people who supplied his
short-lived campaign--Chavez told them he won't be doing any more
fund-raising to cover his $21,000 campaign debt. "Unfortunately, the
result of this campaign is like that of a failed or bankrupt business
as the campaign and candidate are now unable to pay any invoices for
services rendered prior to March 6, 2002," the letter said.</TE>
<TE>   Happy income tax day, Mr. Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   'West Wing' Flunks in Literature, Speech</TE>
<TE>   The "Wednesday night presidency," otherwise known as "The West
Wing," a TV program crafted here on the West Coast, enjoys a
prosperous and learned following--which golden demographics backfired
a bit after a recent episode, in which a White House aide was trying
to get some presidential props for her high school English teacher.</TE>
<TE>   In the course of this plot line, President Jed Bartlet, an erudite
Nobel Prize winner (but not in literature), refers to the great epic
"Beowulf" as a classic of Middle English.</TE>
<TE>   Zounds! It's in Old English, and didn't the e-mails make that
clear! Will there be a script with a Beowulf makeup test?</TE>
<TE>   In the same episode, actor Martin Sheen, who plays the president,
pronounced "cavalry"--as in the George Custer horseback cluster--as
"Calvary"--as in the last sufferings of Jesus. At least it isn't like
Jimmy Carter, who spent four years, and not just one weekly hour of
prime time, mispronouncing "nuclear" as "new-cue-lur."</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Sorkin, creator of this prime-time administration,
responded, "Ic agan nic answaru"--in Old English, roughly: "no
comment."</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Gray Davis' new appointee to the California Science Center in
Los Angeles: Fabian R. Wesson, wife of Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson.</TE>
<TE>   * Former GOP U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson, the comedy sensation from
Wyoming (not to be confused with that other Wyomingite, the
strait-laced Dick Cheney) speaks May 1 at a lunch of the Orange
County Forum in Irvine, then does an encore the next day at UC
Irvine's Center for the Study of Democracy.</TE>
<TE>   * On L.A. Mayor Jim Hahn's 2002 budget list of 50 "new and
improved" park facilities in his city, No. 28 is the "Richard
Alatoree Pool" in El Sereno, misspelling the name of the former
council member who went off the deep end, having a fling with cocaine
and dodging income taxes on money handed over to him by people who
wanted to influence matters bigger than the name on a civic swimming
pool.</TE>
<TE>   * Who can follow the Iron Lady? Chapman University is casting
about for a big-name replacement for former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, now Baroness Thatcher, whose May 4 appearance at
the university's Global Citizen Gala was canceled after her series of
small strokes three weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   * Terry Landreth, a longtime El Segundo resident disgusted with
local politics, patched together the names of two City Council
incumbents running for reelection to create a phantom write-in
candidate, "Jelly Gaowell," but Gaowell lost to the incumbents,
collecting fewer than a dozen write-in votes in last week's election.</TE>

<HD>Hundreds Rally in Support of Israel</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of Jews and Christians lined Bristol Street near Costa
Mesa's South Coast Plaza on Sunday for a pro-Israel rally stirred by
the recent wave of violence in the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   The demonstrators proudly waved blue-and-white Israeli flags and
hundreds of pro-Israel or anti-Palestinian signs during the afternoon
event, which was sponsored by the Jewish Federation and other major
Jewish organizations.</LD>
<LD>   Police and security personnel were out in force, although the
rally was ''orderly and peaceful,'' said Sgt. Frank Rudisill, who
estimated the crowd at more than 500. Demonstrators, however,
believed their ranks were twice that figure.</LD>
<TE>   Ana Faitlowicz, a physician from Huntington Beach, joined
demonstrators with her friend, Greg Silvers of Los Alamitos.
Together, they walked along the sidewalk shouting anti-Yasser Arafat
slogans and carrying flags and signs.</TE>
<TE>   ''I'm here to support Israel and for our country to support
Israel,'' said Faitlowicz, a Jew and native of South America, whose
pro-Israel sign was in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   Silvers, who carried a U.S. flag, said he joined his friend
because he felt compassion for Israel and Israelis. If people in the
United States could live as Israelis in Israel, then they would
understand ''what these people are going through on a daily basis,''
Silvers said. ''These people could die at any moment.''</TE>
<TE>   Jewish organizations nationwide have stepped up activities to
promote the pro-Israel side of the Mideast conflict. Organizers of
the Costa Mesa rally said they are taking their message to the
streets to influence public opinion.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,000 supporters of Israel also demonstrated Sunday in
Manhattan. A pro-Israel rally is scheduled in Washington today.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Lopez, 12, came to the Orange County rally with his
grandmother, Irene Lopez of Orange, a Christian from Calvary Chapel
in Costa Mesa, who said she joined the demonstrators for a spiritual
reason. ''The land belongs to the Jews because the Lord said they're
the chosen ones,'' she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her grandson agreed.</TE>

<HD>Making Steelhead Welcome to Creek</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: The U.S. Park Service will tear down barriers
keeping the endangered fish out of stream in Santa Monicas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After nearly five years of desperate searching and scraping for
money--the usual routine for Malibu real estate--wildlife officials
believe they've found a new home for the beleaguered southern
steelhead trout.</LD>
<LD>   But like a lot of property acquisitions, it involves a tear-down.</LD>
<LD>   This week, the National Park Service will begin demolishing one of
several small barriers blocking the wily salmon-like fish from
swimming up tiny Solstice Creek into the Santa Monica Mountains.</LD>
<TE>   It's the first time the shovel will hit dirt to save the
endangered fish in Los Angeles County, where thousands of steelhead
once traveled from the mountains to the sea and back again in the
area's streams and rivers.</TE>
<TE>   There are at least 15 unique populations of steelhead along the
West Coast, 11 of which have suffered serious declines in recent
decades.</TE>
<TE>   The southern steelhead is the worst off--one expert describes the
fish's predicament as "grim"--and current estimates are that there
are only a few hundred remaining between the Santa Maria River in
Santa Barbara County and San Mateo Creek in northern San Diego
County.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that Solstice Creek by itself isn't going to recover
steelhead," said Ray Sauvajot, a resource specialist with the
National Park Service. "But this is the kind of project that can
serve as a model for similar efforts across Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   Park Service officials said the creek still has all the key
ingredients the fish need. There's cool, clean, year-round water in
the shady creek, besides plenty of insects for food. And nearly all
of Solstice Canyon is protected from development by the surrounding
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing missing: steelhead.</TE>
<TE>   Southern steelhead are rainbow trout, with a twist. Hatched in
coastal streams, steelhead migrate to sea as adults and then, after
one to four years, return to freshwater streams to spawn and
die--although a few hardy fish manage a second round-trip.
Historically, some adults caught in the region have reached lengths
of 2 1/2 feet.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with Solstice Creek is that steelhead can't reach it
because of a series of obstacles, including two culverts, two small
dams and a "concrete apron"--a road that plows through the stream
rather than over it.</TE>
<TE>   The Park Service is replacing the apron with a bridge and removing
parts of the old dams. Between the park boundary and the ocean,
Caltrans plans to renovate a culvert under Pacific Coast Highway to
make it more fish friendly and to fix a culvert beneath Corral Canyon
Road.</TE>
<TE>   The project will cost about $1.5 million and officials hope that
it will be completed by December 2003. The popular Solstice Creek
trailhead will remain open to hikers, but no parking will be
available during construction, which is expected to last the rest of
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Solstice Canyon also will get a few more parking spaces, new
restrooms and an amphitheater for nature programs.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very, very important project politically," said Jim
Edmondson of the Southern California Steelhead Recovery Coalition.
"Once the project is done, you have a great place where the public
can have a picnic and, hopefully, see steelhead. There has to be a
place like Solstice Creek, to be a poster child for the fish."</TE>
<TE>   Solstice Creek is only 5 to 10 feet wide and, at best, offers only
about a mile of habitat for the fish--enough room for maybe 300
steelhead. But the project has been free of the red tape, controversy
and funding problems that have slowed other efforts to restore
steelhead runs on larger streams.</TE>
<TE>   Those include the removal of two huge, silted-up dams, including
one on Malibu Creek and the other on Matilija Creek near Ojai. Taking
down either structure--Matilija Dam is the most likely to fall--would
open profoundly more habitat than is available at Solstice. But each
of those projects would take years.</TE>
<TE>   With the large projects moving at a snail's pace, there is a
growing emphasis on performing a sort of triage on smaller streams
that are home to steelhead. One recent study found that in 25
watersheds in southern Santa Barbara County, at least 400 barriers
hindered or blocked steelhead from migrating up creeks.</TE>
<TE>   "These smaller streams offer a lot of hope because a lot of those
barriers are easy fixes," said Matt Stoecker, an ecologist working
with the Conception Coast Project in Santa Barbara. "If we can get
steelhead back in the small streams, that can be a seed population to
later repopulate the major rivers."</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, a road crossing has been repaired to allow fish
passage up Salsipuedes Creek near Lompoc. An upcoming project will
fix nine bad road crossings on Quiota Creek outside Solvang.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Fish and Game also recently moved two
biologists to Los Alamitos, where they will work exclusively on
southern steelhead issues.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been hard for the department because, up to now, we
haven't had anyone doing restoration down here," said Mary Larson, a
Fish and Game biologist. "Now we do and, hopefully, I can come in and
help."</TE>
<TE>   But will the steelhead find their way back to Solstice Creek?</TE>
<TE>   Biologists think the answer is yes, because of a neat evolutionary
trick the fish use. Unlike salmon, southern steelhead do not show an
undying fidelity to their native spawning grounds. The reason is that
in arid Southern California, their native streams often dry up.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, steelhead are inclined to take what they can get. One
line of thought is that steelhead swim along the coast until they
sense a change in water chemistry signaling fresh water is nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Using that mechanism, biologists said, the fish may stumble onto
Solstice Creek and then recolonize it. If that doesn't work, there is
talk of relocating a few steelhead from some other stream.</TE>
<TE>   The Park Service's Sauvajot said he's like many Southern
Californians in that he never heard of steelhead while growing up in
San Diego. Now he plans to be one of many on the Solstice Creek banks
in two years looking for the fish.</TE>
<TE>   "In my nine years [with the park service], we've done nothing of
this scale, trying to bring something back that's been gone," he
said. "But the most exciting part about this project is you can
actually see an end point. We know if we do this and do that, it's
done."</TE>
<TE>   Then, he says, it's all up to the fish.</TE>

<HD>Investor Traffic Heavy on 101 Tech Corridor</HD>
<DH>Business: Venture capital firms are focusing on the
companies along the freeway. Area now rivals the Westside.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like other technology centers, the western San Fernando Valley
experienced a steep drop in investment during the dot-com bust, but
has since rebounded and matches the Westside in popularity, a new
report shows.</LD>
<LD>   The old-economy ways of most of the privately held, bootstrap
companies of the West Valley and eastern Ventura County shielded them
from the worst of the high-tech fallout, according to the report by
Larta, which conducts research on technology markets in California.</LD>
<LD>   In 2000, the technology corridor that stretches along the Ventura
Freeway from the San Fernando Valley to the Conejo Valley in Ventura
County received a little less than 10% of the venture capital spent
in Southern California, the report said. In contrast, high-tech firms
in Santa Monica and the Westside received about 36%.</LD>
<TE>   Since then, companies along the 101 corridor took in about 14% of
the $835 million in investment dollars, a fraction of a percentage
less than what Westside firms received, according to Larta's Sand
Dollar Report on venture capital in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "The Ventura Freeway corridor has a strong diversified economy,"
said Rohit Shukla, president and chief executive of Larta. He said
spinoffs from defense and first-generation technology companies
fertilized the ground for new businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "There is access to a stock of reasonably good communities, good
schools and a reasonable pool of intellectual capital," Shukla said.</TE>
<TE>   The 101 corridor took root as a technology center in the 1970s
when a few companies worked on U.S. Army projects. By the 1990s,
entertainment and multimedia firms emerged, some from the former
defense outfits. The advent of the Internet and businesses'
dependence on computer networks gave rise to a crop of companies that
dominates the hillside offices of the West Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Computer hardware, network equipment and software design firms
fill the office parks along the 101 Freeway, providing products such
as video games and the digital sound systems used in major film
releases.</TE>
<TE>   The area's defense technology and talent provide fertile ground
for growing companies, such as Westlake Village-based Inphi, which
makes ultra-high speed network equipment. Two of Inphi's three
founders came from HRL Laboratories (formerly Hughes Research
Laboratories), an aerospace research firm in Malibu. Most of the
other 45 employees cut their teeth at tech companies in the West
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   When the bottom began to fall out of the Bay Area's technology
economy two years ago, venture capital firms started looking to
Southern California, the report said. Inphi started in January 2001
with $12 million in funding from two Silicon Valley companies,
Mayfield and Tallwood Venture Capital.</TE>
<TE>   "We look at it like we came out at a good time," said Ann
Dahlquist, Inphi marketing communications manager. A delay in demand
for high-speed hardware gave Inphi time to develop its product, a
device that translates digital information from cables to fiber optic
lines.</TE>
<TE>   "We were somewhat sheltered from the bust," Dahlquist said. "We
came in after they separated wheat from chaff of start-ups that got
money from the we'll-fund-anything period."</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Starr of San Diego-based Mission Ventures agreed that
investors overlooked much of the 101 corridor because they were
distracted by businesses "with great parties and espresso."</TE>
<TE>   "What remains there are what we have always looked for--businesses
with deep technology that have defensible competitive business
advantage."</TE>
<TE>   The seaside digs of Santa Monica attracted more young companies
when money flowed like wine, said Benjamin Kuo, publisher of an
online news digest on local technology that reaches 4,000
subscribers, www.socaltech.com.</TE>
<TE>   "They were hip, but now they're broke," Kuo said.</TE>
<TE>   Kuo's site lists 241 tech companies along the Ventura Freeway,
more than the 134 on the Westside and more than anywhere else in Los
Angeles and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1999, more foreign investors have discovered the 101's tech
campuses. French technology firm Alcatel bought Xylan of Calabasas.
British Spirent absorbed NetCom Systems, another Calabasas company.
Small firms became part of larger ones and big ones became bigger.</TE>
<TE>   Although the West Valley claims notable dot-com survivors such as
United Online (formerly Netzero), it is also home to Homestore.com,
which lost about $1.5 billion last year, according to the Securities
and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the Southern California tech sector grew faster in the
past year than other established silicon centers in the Bay Area, New
York, Austin and Massachusetts, according to the Sand Dollar Report.</TE>

<HD>Program Helps Students Get Suited for the Job</HD>
<DH>Philanthropy: Those seeking to move from welfare to work
get a boost from Mervyn's, which provides free business clothing to
wear to interviews.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Julie McHugh didn't need to think twice when asked if she'd like a
free shopping trip courtesy of Mervyn's Community Closet.</LD>
<LD>   An opportunity for a new outfit doesn't come along too often for
this 28-year-old mother of four. For McHugh, the timing couldn't have
been better.</LD>
<LD>   After her shopping excursion aboard the department store's
converted 72-foot big-rig truck, McHugh was headed for her
third--and, it turns out, final--interview for a position as a
teacher at the child-care center at Amgen Inc. in Newbury Park.</LD>
<TE>   "This is what I'm going to wear to my interview. It's nice to know
the community is out there and willing to help," the Thousand Oaks
resident said before stepping inside the bright yellow truck, which
was stationed in a student parking lot at Moorpark College for two
days last week.</TE>
<TE>   Friday afternoon, McHugh found out she got the job.</TE>
<TE>   Set up like a miniature store, the vehicle was fitted with racks
of clothes, four dressing rooms and a lounging area. Several Mervyn's
associates were on hand to help with the selection of clothing and
accessories.</TE>
<TE>   McHugh was one of 68 people chosen to participate during the
Moorpark College stop of the Community Closet program, which was
created five years ago to assist people trying to move from public
assistance to self-sufficiency through education and job training
programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these folks have never had new clothes," said Cynthia
York, vice chair for the Ventura County Commission for Women and an
employment career specialist with the East County Job and Career
Center.</TE>
<TE>   York helped bring the Mervyn's tour to Ventura County. Along with
the Moorpark College stop, the Community Closet visited Thousand Oaks
last week and has trips planned to Ventura College April 23 and 24,
and Oxnard College April 25 and 26.</TE>
<TE>   Community Closet beneficiaries are from organizations such as
CalWORKS, a welfare-to-work program that provides financial
assistance to students. Other participating groups include the career
centers of Ventura, Oxnard and Moorpark colleges, Extended
Opportunity Program and Services (EOPS), and Caregivers.</TE>
<TE>   About 300 men and women will have been outfitted by the time the
big rig rolls out of the county. The store on wheels will make 22
stops throughout California.</TE>
<TE>   "For our Oxnard College participants, it's a reward for completing
and excelling in our vocational training," said Lillian Manning,
CalWORKS coordinator at the college. Women receive a jacket, skirt,
dress pants, blouse, twin sweater set, scarf, belt, pantyhose, shoes
and earrings; men get a blazer, dress and casual pants, dress shirt,
polo shirt, tie, belt, socks and shoes. Each ensemble is worth $350
to $400.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't know what to expect when we came out to help," said
Daron Oda, a volunteer from the Simi Valley Mervyn's store. "To see
some of these people walk in so timidly and then walk out bolstered
with self-esteem is so great."</TE>
<TE>   To further ease the anxiety that goes with job interviews, the
Moorpark College coordinators put together a briefcase filled with a
gift certificate for a free haircut, notepads, pens, a daily planner
and other items. Additionally, there was a cosmetics rep available to
give the women free makeovers, while the men received free
after-shave.</TE>
<TE>   As Moorpark College student Ursula Johnson, 37, headed out with an
armful of bags, she said she appreciated the help received from the
EOPS program and the department store.</TE>
<TE>   "This is so important, because not everyone who attends college is
fortunate," she said. "And you know what they say: 'You never get a
second chance to make a first impression.'"</TE>

<HD>'Sold' Is Sign of the Times in County</HD>
<DH>Housing: Real estate prices have soared in the last two
months. With buyers lining up, bidding wars return.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Flush with a $95,000 profit from a Los Angeles County home, Mike
Riach thought he'd have no trouble finding a house he could afford in
Ventura County.</LD>
<LD>   But the 33-year-old firefighter lost out on a full-price offer in
Ventura. Then he found that just about anything in his price range
was sold by the time he saw it.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, after months of hunting, Riach and his wife, Suzie, got
lucky in a lottery-type sale in Camarillo and bought the last model
home in a new subdivision for $340,000. Eighty people had signed a
waiting list for the opportunity.</LD>
<TE>   "They called out our name and my wife jumped up screaming," he
said. The victory will cost the Riaches 44% of their take-home income
each month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's $100,000 more than I wanted to spend; just way too much,"
Riach said. "But it's really good for today's market. It's amazing
what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   In the last two months, Ventura County's scorching housing market
has gotten so hot that some veteran agents say it matches or
surpasses the real estate run-ups of the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Bidding wars are back, agents say. Some owners sell their own
homes without an agent in days. And even houses priced above the
perceived market are fetching more than owners are asking.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost as if somebody flipped a switch in late January, and
everybody came out in droves," said Ventura agent Harold Powell. "In
the last month we've had multiple offers on four or five properties.
Three of them have sold over the asking price."</TE>
<TE>   Those houses sold for $285,000 to $500,000, he said. A year or two
ago, they would have cost $50,000 to $100,000 less.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County, a commuter haven for San Fernando Valley workers
for decades, is now also seen as an affordable alternative for
professionals who work in the pricey coastal enclaves of Los Angeles
and Santa Barbara counties.</TE>
<TE>   Broker Mike Glickman, the onetime golden-boy of San Fernando
Valley real estate, began his move into Ventura County a year ago to
catch what he said is the strongest market he has seen since entering
the business in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a gold rush out here," he said. "There's nothing to compare
to the frenzy going on in Ventura County right now."</TE>
<TE>   Glickman said he personally sells a house a day in this county,
about one-third of his total in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the Spanish-style home Jill and Matthew Clark bought for
$390,000 in the lower Ventura hills in June. Two weeks ago, they sold
the same 1,600-square-foot bungalow on a postage-stamp lot for
$460,000. That's a cool $70,000 bump in 10 months.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen people called the first day, and the house sold by
nightfall.</TE>
<TE>   "Even the Realtors were shocked at how quickly it went," Jill
Clark said. "It's a very hot market in this moderate price range."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Evans, the agent who listed the Clark home, said Santa
Barbara's prices, especially, have sent young couples southward to
Ventura and Oxnard looking for deals. An older Spanish home with a
view can cost $800,000 to $900,000 in Santa Barbara, he said, but
$500,000 in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates are that 20,000 Santa Barbara County workers commute
from west Ventura County each day, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lived here 32 years, and I've never seen anything like
this," Evans said. "They'll drive 45 minutes each way to save
$300,000 on a house. Every time we sell a house, we'll raise the next
price $10,000 or $15,000 for the same neighborhood, and it still
sells. Sometimes in a day or two at full price."</TE>
<TE>   Countywide home sales figures for February, the most recent
available, were up 36% from the year before and far outpaced those
for the same month in 1988 and 1989. The median price soared from
$253,000 in February 2001 to $303,000 a year later.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got sales numbers we wouldn't normally see until summer,"
said John Karevoll, analyst for DataQuick Information Systems of La
Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   DataQuick's figures are based on closed escrows and generally
reflect deals reached in January. A west county Realtors' group,
which counts escrows when they open, reported that March sales were
up 41% over February and that the median price for the nearly 500
single-family homes on the market is about $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Agents say prices and competition for homes have only increased in
recent weeks as buyers have tried to beat twin bugaboos--rising
prices and mortgage interest rates hikes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very unusual market," said Karen Campbell, president of
the Ventura County Coastal Assn. of Realtors, which represents agents
from six cities in the west county.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago in Ventura, for example, only about 80 houses and
condos were for sale, far fewer than usual. About 100 more were on
the market in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing to sell," she said, "so prices are continually
going up. There are five buyers for every house, so you're going to
have bidding wars."</TE>
<TE>   It's purely a seller's market, and that's not good, Campbell said,
because it prices the young, the old and even middle-income couples
out of the market.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks agent Jim Keith said he saw the problem recently.</TE>
<TE>   A woman shopping for a Thousand Oaks condo agreed to pay $167,000
for 900 square feet of living space, $2,000 higher than the asking
price. But the deal fell through, and a few days later an identical
model listed for $172,500 and had six offers, including five that
were above the asking price.</TE>
<TE>   Keith said he called about another condo in Simi Valley listed at
$174,500. But it had five offers pending. Keith's buyer decided not
to compete in such a volatile market.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Greer, president of the Conejo Valley Assn. of Realtors,
said the housing supply is far below demand in the Thousand Oaks area
even though there are about 1,000 listings between Agoura Hills and
Newbury Park.</TE>
<TE>   "The last three I did all sold within 10 days for very close to if
not the full asking price," he said. "They were all $300,000 to
$400,000, which is really our best market."</TE>
<TE>   In the Conejo Valley, activity doesn't seem as frenzied as it did
in the boom 13 years ago, Greer said.</TE>
<TE>   "But that doesn't mean it won't get there," he said. "Supply is
definitely low and demand is definitely high."</TE>
<TE>   There are those who fear a bubble similar to the one that burst in
1989, cutting 20% off the value of a typical Ventura County house.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what's happening," said association president Campbell, a
Ventura agent. "I bought a condo in '82 for $99,000, and it was worth
$170,000 in the late '80s. Four years after that, it was worth
$99,000 again, and then we sold it two years ago for $174,000. We're
on top now. But I'm waiting to see where we are going from here."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Campbell has invested in the strong new market herself. After
languishing on a waiting list to buy a new house in a central Ventura

Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   "The builder called and said, 'Do you want this house or not? If
you don't, I've got people waiting behind you,'" she said.</TE>
<TE>   She bought the 3,028-square-foot home for $460,000. Since then,
the builder has opened a fifth phase of the same project.</TE>
<TE>   "They sold them all in a day and a half, for more than I paid,"
Campbell said. "So it already looks like a good deal."</TE>

<HD>History Tells Us That We Need Bin Laden Dead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAX BOOT</AU>
<BD>Max Boot, the Wall Street Journal's editorial features
editor, is the author of "The Savage Wars of Peace: Small Wars and
the Rise of American Power" (Basic Books, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent capture of Abu Zubeida, one of the top Al Qaeda leaders,
is certainly good news. But where's Osama bin Laden?</LD>
<LD>   In the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, President Bush pledged to
bring back the world's top terrorist, "dead or alive." He was
promptly pilloried for "personalizing" the conflict. Now
administration officials stress that, while they'd dearly love to get
their hands on Bin Laden, this is no longer a top goal.</LD>
<LD>   It's true that capturing or killing Bin Laden wouldn't win the war
on terrorism, but not capturing or killing him would be a huge
setback. To get a sense of how huge, we need to go back to 1916. On
March 9 of that year, Francisco "Pancho" Villa, the famed Mexican
bandit turned revolutionary, attacked the town of Columbus, N.M. His
pistoleros killed 18 Americans and wounded nine.</LD>
<TE>   President Woodrow Wilson, sounding very much like George W. Bush
in 2001, pledged that an army expedition "will be sent at once in
pursuit of Villa with the single object of capturing him and putting
a stop to his forays."</TE>
<TE>   Gen. John J. Pershing's expedition is incorrectly remembered as a
clumsy, lumbering, slow-footed beast. Actually its 10,000 men engaged
in some of the fastest and longest cavalry rides in U.S. history. But
they came close to snaring Villa only once, and that was within the
first two weeks of the expedition. The Mexican revolutionary, wounded
in the leg, barely escaped and then hid out in a cave to recuperate
while Pershing's men searched all of northern Mexico for him.</TE>
<TE>   Pershing did manage to kill 135 Villistas, wound 85 and capture
19, but in the process he almost sparked a war with the Mexican
government. By July 1916 the expedition was forced to retreat to a
camp site in northern Mexico, where it remained until being withdrawn
entirely in early 1917.</TE>
<TE>   Villa had been on his last legs when he attacked Columbus. But the
armed yanquis in their midst allowed him to rally patriotic sentiment
to his side. Before long he had 5,000 men and was on the offensive.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of the Pershing expedition has long been debated by
historians. Was it a success or a failure? It was a little of both,
but more failure than success because it didn't snare Villa. It
didn't matter how many of his followers were killed or apprehended.
As long as their charismatic leader--whose eyes, according to one
person who met him, were "really not eyes at all, but gimlets which
seem to bore into your very soul"--was still at large, he could
always assembly another army.</TE>
<TE>   Osama bin Laden is, by all accounts, every bit as magnetic as
Villa, and even more dangerous. He may already be dead, but if he's
not, we'd better get him fast, lest he stage a Villa-like resurgence.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that the U.S. armed forces have staged some
daring raids in the past to capture or kill rebel leaders just as
elusive as Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   In 1915 U.S. Marines occupied Haiti to end a long period of
turmoil. Four years of U.S. rule led to accumulated grievances, and
in 1919 an attorney named Charlemagne Peralte rallied a rebellion
behind the cry "Haiti for the Haitians." His cacos--a combination of
bandits and revolutionaries, named, it was said, after a local bird
of prey--soon had much of the north in turmoil.</TE>
<TE>   The job of stopping Peralte fell to Marine Herman Hanneken, who
financed his own "caco" band, which pretended to stage attacks on
gendarmerie outposts. Hanneken hoped to lure Peralte down from the
mountains, but the rebel leader was too smart to leave his camp. So
Hanneken went to get him.</TE>
<TE>   He and another Marine, Cpl. William Button, blackened their
bodies, and along with some native gendarmes, pretended to be cacos.
The ruse worked; they reached Peralte's camp and in a brief firefight
killed him. The war was all but finished that night.</TE>
<TE>   America today could use some "Hard Head" Hannekens--soldiers who
can use their imagination to lay unexpected traps for our enemies.</TE>
<TE>   The consequences of not capturing Bin Laden are far worse than the
consequences of not capturing Peralte or Villa. Bin Laden has already
killed far more Americans than the other revolutionaries combined. If
he lives to defy America's wrath, the consequences may make Sept. 11
seem benign by comparison.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush had it right from the beginning: We need to bring
back Osama bin Laden, dead or alive.</TE>

<HD>The U.S., Europe: Two Old Friends Must Renew Mutual Respect</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEREK CHOLLET</AU>
<BD>Derek Chollet, who served in the U.S. State Department
during the Clinton administration, is a fellow at the American
Academy in Berlin.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Listening to the voices from both sides of the Atlantic, it is easy
to think that the United States and Europe are headed for an
irreparable break. Whether it's about Ariel Sharon, Saddam Hussein or
steel, the U.S. and Europe just can't agree.</LD>
<LD>   Many in Europe believe that President Bush and his administration
are unbending unilateralists who don't care about the views of their
long-standing allies.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile in Washington, many believe that Europe is so
self-absorbed and so weak militarily that it neither understands the
nature of the threats emanating from places such as the Middle East
nor could it do anything about them.</LD>
<TE>   Both sides are right. But at the same time, both are wrong. The
Bush administration has shown that it is capable of deft multilateral
diplomacy when it wants to be, and in the recent military campaign in
eastern Afghanistan, Europe has proved it is ready to join in the
fight. Rather than finger-pointing, Washington and Europe must change
how they approach each other.</TE>
<TE>   For the Bush administration, this requires a more serious attempt
to get its European partners on board. So far, Bush has offered only
rhetoric and meetings with British Prime Minister Tony Blair--neither
of which goes very far on the Continent.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of real effort to consult Europe has been astonishing.
Secretary of State Colin Powell's visit to Madrid last week is his
first to Europe this year. On Vice President Dick Cheney's 10-day
tour to build support for confronting Iraq, his only European stop
was London. Bush will finally visit Europe in May.</TE>
<TE>   European officials say that there are virtually no working-level
consultations. They complain that Washington calls only when it has
made a decision. It will be impossible for Washington to get Europe's
support if it does not even try. Yet to simply try harder will not be
enough--Europe needs to show that it is a willing partner. This
starts, of course, by Europe doing more to improve its military
capabilities so it can be a powerful ally.</TE>
<TE>   Europeans have been slow to appreciate the new threats that shape
world politics. In some ways this is understandable. From World War
II through the 1990s, the U.S.-European alliance's highest priority
was to promote European stability and make the Continent whole and
free.</TE>
<TE>   That dream is almost reality. So Europe must see that the new
threats come from terrorist networks and those anti-democratic,
anti-Western states that prey on innocents and are determined to
undermine stability and our way of life.</TE>
<TE>   Europe must acknowledge loudly that suicide bombers and regimes
like Hussein's represent everything the alliance has stood
against--and that bold action is required, not more rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   This does not mean that European leaders should simply step aside
and salute while the U.S. acts on its own. But they must be more
mature partners. All too often it seems that the best Europe can do
is second-guess U.S. policy. If its leaders think that a different
strategy could be more effective, then they need to offer Washington
real alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, expect a self-fulfilling prophesy: The less Europe
offers, the more the Bush administration's unilateral instincts will
be reinforced and the more Europe will be isolated and ignored.</TE>
<TE>   If Europe fails to change its outlook and approach--if it refuses
to acknowledge that new threats exist, and if it can't move beyond
its well-worn criticisms of U.S. policy and instead suggest better
ideas--then U.S.-Europe relations may be headed for the breach so
many fear.</TE>
<TE>   If this happens, it will be a historic failure of leadership, and
both sides will be to blame.</TE>

<HD>Lasting Peace Grows One Olive Leaf at a Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>OSHA GRAY DAVIDSON</AU>
<BD>Osha Gray Davidson is the author of "The Best of
Enemies" (Scribner, 1996), a nonfiction account of a friendship
between a North Carolina Ku Klux Klan leader and a black domestic
worker.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like thousands of other American Jews who grew up in the late 1950s
and early '60s, I have cherished memories of "leaf stamps" and of the
semi-religious ritual that surrounded them.</LD>
<LD>   Once a month, I brought quarters hoarded from my allowance to
Sunday school at Temple B'nai Jeshurun in Des Moines and exchanged
them for stickers the size and shape of postage stamps, each one with
a picture of a leaf. I pasted the stamps on a poster with the image
of a bare-limbed tree. The fun was watching the limbs fill up with
leaves, one by one--spring played out on paper in tantalizing slow
motion. When the poster tree was filled with stamps, a real tree was
planted in Israel, and I was handed a new poster tree, its bare limbs
once again crying out for leaves.</LD>
<LD>   This notion of planting trees in a desert half a world away may
sound like an abstract exercise, but it was overwhelmingly real to
me. I daydreamed about those endless groves of oranges, lemons and
grapefruit, the desert made to bloom thanks to my quarters. A
miracle!</LD>
<TE>   But an even more important miracle lay beneath the surface: The
trees were both real and symbolic, a stand-in for the still fledgling
Jewish state. What young Jew growing up in the shadow of the
Holocaust could resist such an enterprise? You were funding both a
real tree and a metaphoric one, a tree of hope.</TE>
<TE>   Hope. Today, how can one even utter the word in the context of the
Mideast? The unblinking eye of television shows us scene after scene
of violence.</TE>
<TE>   The carnage wrought by yet another suicide bombing, with all the
usual and horrifying elements: a shoe, a handbag, walls smeared with
Israeli blood. Tanks blasting apart the homes of alleged militants
and their families. The Israeli military keeps journalists at a
distance, so we can only imagine what we're not allowed to see: the
shoe, the handbag, walls smeared with Palestinian blood.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli hard-liners insist that the only way to achieve peace is
through Ariel Sharon's nightmare policies of West Bank incursions,
targeted assassinations and ever-expanding settlements. It's a
fantasy based on crushing, if not eliminating, the Palestinians. But
these hard-liners are not only immoral, they're also wrong. As wrong
as their Arab counterparts who preach a peace that comes from the
destruction of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Those posters of trees from my childhood provide the only way out
of the current situation. The dream remains the same, but as an
adult, I see another branch on that tree of peace, and it is labeled
Palestine. Without a viable Palestine, the old dream of an Israel at
peace will remain a fantasy.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Israeli group Rabbis for Human Rights began
collecting money to replant some of the more than 30,000 Palestinian
olive trees that have been bulldozed by the Israeli military. It may
not sound like much, but perhaps it is as close to a miracle as we
can hope for today. Because, as I learned decades ago, lasting peace
grows one leaf at a time.</TE>

<HD>The Right to Refuse Searches Is in Danger</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC L. MILLER and RONALD WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>Marc L. Miller is a law professor at Emory University.
Ronald Wright is a law professor at Wake Forest University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We became a new nation after Sept. 11. Legislatures and courts
continue to reassess police powers and individual rights. Sometimes,
the best answer to a threat to our values is to reaffirm the idea of
liberty and to bolster the freedoms that define American life. Making
"consent" searches fairer would be a good place to start.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a criminal
case involving drug runners, but potential terrorists will lurk in
the background.</LD>
<LD>   The deceptively simple issue in the case is whether police must
tell citizens in confined settings such as a public bus that they
have the right to refuse to consent to a search of their persons and
belongings.</LD>
<TE>   In United States vs. Drayton, three police officers boarded a bus
at a Greyhound station in Tallahassee, Fla. One officer knelt on the
empty driver's seat, looking toward the rear. The other two officers
walked to the back of the bus and worked their way forward, asking
passengers where they were traveling and matching travelers to
luggage.</TE>
<TE>   The officers identified themselves in low voices and asked two men
for permission to search their one bag. The men agreed. After the
officers found nothing in the bag, they asked the men if they could
conduct a pat-down search. The men agreed again. The officers
discovered packets of cocaine on the men's thighs.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the men's
convictions on drug charges, finding that the passengers' consent
"was not sufficiently free of coercion to serve as a valid basis for
a search."</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court does not write on a clean slate. Thirty years
ago, in Schneckloth vs. Bustamonte, the high court held that the
federal Constitution does not require police to inform citizens of
their right to refuse to consent when a police officer asks for
permission to search. Consent, the court said, can happen without
knowledge of the available options.</TE>
<TE>   While not a staple of popular TV dramas, consent searches dominate
the real world of police work. Once a person consents to a search,
all the usual 4th Amendment protections go out the window, including
the requirement that police have probable cause for searches, or the
lesser requirement of reasonable suspicion for short investigative
stops.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law recognizes that a person, in theory, could refuse to
answer or walk away. But in fact most citizens do not believe they
have any choice.</TE>
<TE>   The officers in the Drayton case testified that in 800 searches
over the previous year, only five to seven passengers declined
luggage searches.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of Drayton would have been easy to predict before
Sept. 11; it has become even easier now. The court is likely to
reverse the 11th Circuit and reaffirm its view that the U.S.
Constitution does not require that citizens know they can refuse to
consent to a search.</TE>
<TE>   Although this outcome is predictable, it is wrong. True consent
should reflect true choice. To consent, a citizen must know she can
refuse to consent.</TE>
<TE>   The high court could instead give common-sense meaning to consent
searches. A brief warning--one far simpler than the already simple
"Miranda warnings" required before interrogations--would not
interfere with police work. The court could limit the warning
requirement to settings such as buses or traffic stops, where a
person is least likely to believe that there is any option other than
kowtowing to authority.</TE>
<TE>   For many years, the FBI has required its agents to explain that a
citizen may refuse to consent. So have some state courts and
legislatures and local police departments, sometimes requiring
consent to be in writing.</TE>
<TE>   Some situations since Sept. 11 will require that police be granted
new authority to search.</TE>
<TE>   Some unreasonable searches before the terrorist attacks now will
be deemed reasonable. But in settings like this where the law is
built on a dishonest premise, the shock to the foundations of our
legal systems should instead encourage greater liberty.</TE>
<TE>   In Drayton, the Supreme Court has the opportunity to fix a major
flaw in current 4th Amendment doctrine.</TE>
<TE>   Since it is unlikely to do so, state courts, state legislatures
and local police departments have the responsibility to reshape
consent searches and other police-citizen interactions into a fairer
framework.</TE>

<LD>The Bush administration has found a new excuse for exploring and
drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--Saddam
Hussein's cutoff of oil exports. But this argument is just as weak as
all that came before. Even the White House acknowledged Thursday that
the Iraqi cutoff had not affected the oil market. ''The point is why
take the risk?'' Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said. The response
should be: Why undertake the systematic industrialization of one of
the nation's premier wilderness areas for a marginal amount of oil?</LD>
<LD>   The president is determined to open the refuge even though the oil
companies themselves show little enthusiasm for poking around the
tundra for an estimated 3.2 billion barrels of economically
recoverable oil, about what this nation consumes in six months.</LD>
<LD>   To allow the search for and possible production of oil in the
Alaska refuge, Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska) is expected soon to
propose an amendment to energy legislation now before the Senate.
Hussein has stopped oil exports from Iraq for at least a month or
until Israel withdraws its forces from the West Bank. But the oil we
get from Iraq amounts to only about 3% of U.S. supply. The far
greater flow of oil from Venezuela was interrupted by a recently
ended oil workers strike, with no great outcry.</LD>
<TE>   The loss of those imports has had little impact on oil markets,
administration officials acknowledge. Saudi Arabia and others are
expected to make up for the loss, and the Alaskan oil, which would
take years to get to market, could hardly ease any need soon.</TE>
<TE>   Fleisher's question about "why take the risk?" would be better
applied to drilling in the Arctic wilderness. Other hard questions
include: Why deliberately risk a unique natural environment when the
oil companies can develop greater oil supplies at far less cost
elsewhere in the world? Why mock the notion that exploration and
drilling would disturb the caribou? Why outrageously exaggerate the
potential economic benefits of the Alaska petroleum? Why keep
peddling the myth that oil production would not harm the Arctic
environment?</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has made drilling in the refuge something of a
political holy war. He is spending political capital that he will
need later and should weigh the cost.</TE>

<LD>Several U.S. Supreme Court justices seem poised--indeed, eager--to
allow widely expanded drug testing in schools. Think of what that
might mean in Los Angeles, where too few schools have enough
textbooks, credentialed teachers or even toilet paper. Would
administrators be expected to spend classroom time and buckets of
money making tens of thousands of students urinate into plastic cups?
That strikes us as unconstitutionally invasive, not particularly
helpful in rooting out drug use and certain to sour whatever love of
learning is left in these difficult educational times.</LD>
<LD>   In 1995, the court upheld an Oregon school board's policy that all
athletes submit to drug testing as a condition of participation in
team sports. In 1998, Tecumseh High School in Oklahoma went much
further, insisting that students in any after-school program be
subject to routine and random tests. You want to sign up for the
choir? Future Farmers of America? The chess club? Here's a cup, get
in line.</LD>
<TE>   Now it's up to the Supreme Court to decide whether this is
constitutional. Last month, when they heard the challenge to
Oklahoma's testing policy, brought by a choir member, now graduated,
several justices made clear that their sympathies were with the
Tecumseh school. If parents do not like the policy, Justice Antonin
Scalia snapped, they can ask the school board to change it. Or send
their child to a "druggie school," offered Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy. A ruling is expected by summer.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's hard enough for a student to grasp algebra or a
Shakespearean sonnet without being distracted by mumbling pot heads
or babbling coke addicts. But when school officials have reasonable
suspicion that a student is using illegal drugs or has brought them
onto campus, they already can--and should--identify that individual
and, if a search or test confirms drug use, expel him or her. Schools
already have the authority to search lockers and backpacks, and
vigilant administrators in Los Angeles and elsewhere do that.</TE>
<TE>   But what would happen if schools received a green light for drug
testing in the absence of specific suspicions, as seems possible
based on the justices' sharp retorts in the case? The kids doing
drugs are probably too messed up to make the track team or be
interested in the debate club in the first place. So under the
Tecumseh policy, schools would focus their testing on the kids least
likely to be stoners and make them feel like criminals in the
process. Indeed, in the first year the policy was in place only three
students turned up with positive drug tests. Probably lots of other
kids were dissuaded from joining school clubs.</TE>
<TE>   In Northern California's Modoc County, the school board was poised
to go even further, requiring annual drug tests of all high school
students. But the board dropped the plan last week amid protests from
parents and students--one of whom asked the provocative question: Why
not test the whole town?</TE>
<TE>   There's a serious constitutional issue at stake here. The 4th
Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches would seem to require school
officials to have reasonable suspicion that a student is using drugs
before subjecting him or her to a urine test.</TE>
<TE>   To endorse Tecumseh's invasive and humiliating screening policy is
to declare that children, as a group, leave their constitutional
rights at the schoolhouse door. Only prisoners, as a group, have
lesser constitutional protections by law. And to reach that condition
people have to be convicted of a crime first. Surely we don't think
of our children as prison inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Tecumseh's policy is not only extremely troubling on
constitutional grounds, it's also costly, distracting and not much
help in cutting drug use on campus. If only the Supreme Court could
see that.</TE>

<LD>What a long, strange trip it's turned into for Louis Rukeyser, the
69-year-old financial news talk show host who recently was evicted
from his cozy, living room-like set on public television. Bearish
fans have threatened to silence upcoming PBS phone pledge banks, and
the regular panelists of "Wall Street Week" are boycotting the
replacement show.</LD>
<LD>   Maryland Public Television sparked the unlikely protest with its
decision that the show no longer was relevant to today's
investors--read that as being out of touch with younger viewers. Then
the outfit inexplicably hired a 72-year-old replacement host.</LD>
<LD>   The ensuing ruckus would have delighted the late Jerry Garcia,
another guy who figured out how to profit from loyal fans. Though
small in relative numbers, Deadheads and Lou's Legions clearly stand
by their men. The musicians of Garcia's Grateful Dead were masters of
spinoff merchandising, and the surviving members continue to market
new compact discs and T-shirts even though they haven't played
together in years.</LD>
<TE>   Rukeyser likewise has spun his own fortune, with speeches,
newsletters, conferences and ocean cruises that generate $20 million
in estimated annual revenue. It's no accident that "Wall Street Week"
regulars drum up business by strutting their stuff on Mediterranean
cruises and at conferences in Italian resorts. CNBC, where a new show
called "Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street" debuts Friday night, is getting
a potentially hot commodity in the dry world of financial journalism.
Rukeyser in turn gains the national television audience he needs to
keep his empire flourishing.</TE>
<TE>   PBS can be faulted for its handling of the messy divorce. But
maybe it was time for Rukeyser, the cheerleader for unbridled
capitalism, to test his free-market theories without the publicly
subsidized safety net provided by PBS viewers.</TE>

<LD>Re "Good Riddance to Oprah's Book Club, and Her Literary Amateurism,"
Commentary, April 11:</LD>
<LD>   Who on Earth does Norah Vincent think she is, and who made her the
arbiter of quality literature? What colossal arrogance to assume that
Oprah Winfrey's taste and opinions are "amateurish to say the least."
Apparently Oprah's inspiring "the masses" to read is a transgression
since she represents the "pernicious homogenization of American life"
with her "demeaning sensibility." Which, inevitably, leads poor
Vincent to "existential despair"!</LD>
<LD>   How can Vincent say she "abhors snobs" when that is precisely what
she is? I don't know what or if she has written, but with her elitist
condescension I would not read her book, sticker or not.</LD>
<TE>   Naomi Z. Feldman</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What an angry piece by Vincent; it reeks of sour grapes. Not all
may agree with the selections in Oprah's Book Club, but no one should
question Winfrey's positive influence in getting Americans to read
more and to discuss literature in group settings. Her efforts have
played an enormous role in the rise of book groups, particularly
among women. These book groups provide a wonderful sense of community
and connectedness in an increasingly confusing and disconnected
world.</TE>
<TE>   I for one thank Winfrey for her efforts. Vincent needs to get a
life--or maybe just read a good book before she sinks further into
"existential despair."</TE>
<TE>   Rose Hayden-Smith</TE>
<TE>   Ventura</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I have seldom read such a whining, self-satisfied column as the
one Vincent wrote regarding the demise of Oprah's Book Club. Was it
really so disastrous that a television host would actually encourage
her audience to read?</TE>
<TE>   In case Vincent is too highbrow to notice or care, many of Oprah's
choices are downright great books; for example, she encouraged my
daughters, sister and me to read the critically acclaimed "The
Poisonwood Bible" by Barbara Kingsolver, and we all thoroughly
enjoyed it and have had many great discussions about it.</TE>
<TE>   I've been an avid reader all of my life and believe that Winfrey
should be highly praised for her support and love of reading and for
spreading that message to her huge television audience.</TE>
<TE>   Judith Squires</TE>
<TE>   Burbank</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For a while, I have been thinking that author Jonathan Franzen and
I were the only ones who objected to Oprah and her self-serving book
club choices, but here we have Vincent's article wishing her "good
riddance." Franzen is an intellectual, a talented writer, as is
Vincent, and I am just a book lover. And yet I objected to Oprah's
choices as being redundant, simplistic and way too commercial, what
with her logo, of all things, on a stand-alone book.</TE>
<TE>   Shame on Oprah for her runaway ego, thinking she is all things to
all people, even readers of books. I never bought a book with the
Oprah logo on it, although I did read a couple of her choices. Once
again, we readers are returned to the days when we can make our own
choices, based only on any of the numerous book reviews,
recommendations from friends or bookshop employees, or even based on
the cover alone, if we like. Let's go read a book.</TE>
<TE>   Anne Salazar</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vincent's claws were newly sharpened and out in her attack on
Oprah's Book Club. I guess I'm one of the morons who enjoy being
advised of a good book. Nobody forces me to read or visit Barnes &amp;
Noble; that's my choice. Maybe Vincent should read Franzen's book;
she might meet someone she knows!</TE>
<TE>   Jack Mason</TE>
<TE>   Palm Desert</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Funny, Vincent says: "If Oprah's Book Club is gone, good riddance.
Now if only B&amp;N would go with it." This is after also saying,
"Because someone famous said it, suddenly it matters, even though the
famous person in question often knows little or nothing about the
matter at hand." Um, who is she again?</TE>

<HD>Taking Good Advice on Bad Drugs</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Along the lines of psychiatrist Julie Holland's "Teaching Young
People Safe X Beats Just Saying No" (Commentary, April 10), perhaps
public service announcements should give practical advice on how to
drive while intoxicated. Let's face it, you can tell people not to
drive while drunk, but this only tempts them even more. We need to
adopt a more enlightened approach. When driving drunk, drive slowly.
Try to stay in your lane. Try not to pass out while you are waiting
for the light to turn green. Avoid hitting other vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   Ecstasy is just a bad drug. It may not kill you if taken in
smaller doses, but the risk of long-term depression, panic attacks,
other psychiatric disorders and reduced memory capability are reasons
enough to stay away from this drug.</LD>
<LD>   Andrew Koines</LD>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I applaud Holland's efforts to keep children safe. Though the
thought of one's children taking Ecstasy--or any other drug, for that
matter (over-the-counter and prescription drugs included)--can be
frightening, the thought of harm or even death is worse.</TE>
<TE>   Teenagers will ultimately make their own decisions, and the best
path is to teach them how to stay as safe as possible. Sensationalism
and scare tactics do not work. Honesty does.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Ruckel</TE>
<TE>   Program Associate</TE>
<TE>   Drug Policy Alliance</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On one hand, educating kids about Ecstasy may help save young
lives. On the other hand, by teaching kids about Ecstasy and what the
safest way to take it is, we are accepting it and sending the wrong
message to our youth. When kids read these guidelines on how to take
the drug they will think that it is safe to take as long as they
follow the instructions.</TE>
<TE>   Once someone is under the influence of this drug, he or she is in
no condition to accurately follow the guidelines. Teaching kids about
safe sex should not be compared to teaching kids about how to use
drugs. Sex is not against the law nor is it wrong. Under no
circumstances is it acceptable to take Ecstasy.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I occasionally drop off and pick up people from LAX. The lack of
common sense of many of the traffic police makes me wonder what they
are being told to do by their supervisors. Recently, I picked up my
wife at the Southwest terminal at 8 p.m. I saw her waiting but could
not get over to the inside lane to pick her up. I pulled over by the
shuttle bus lane for no more than 30 seconds with no one behind me.
She climbed in the car and we started to drive away, when a traffic
policeman knocked on my window and told me to pull over. He started
writing me a ticket, making me wait in the red zone, and now blocking
traffic because he made me wait for 10 minutes while he filled out
the ticket.</LD>
<LD>   I have other examples (making drivers move their cars when there
is no line and no other cars are waiting), but the issue is, aren't
they there to make things run more smoothly, not less?</LD>

<LD>Gov. Gray Davis has mismanaged California's schools, energy supplies
and state budget, yet he continues to be a prodigious fund-raiser.
Why? As noted in "Simon Trails Davis in Major Fund-Raising" (April
10), our governor raked in $251,000 from the California Correctional
Peace Officers Assn. after he agreed to a substantial raise for state
prison guards and recommended that five private prisons be closed.</LD>
<LD>   At the very least, Davis gives the appearance that he is a
politician who is for sale to special interests. That is why voters
who care about about California's schools, energy and budget should
vote for Bill Simon.</LD>

<LD>Re your April 11 photo, "A Fight Against Famine": Since when does the
U.N. make famished people work for their 4 1/2 pounds of grain? I was
appalled to see this photo of North Koreans--starving people--piling
up dirt for food. It looked pathetic and like "make work" to me, and
no better than slavery. I hope that The Times can follow up on this
issue with further reporting on the policies of food distribution by
the U.N. and in particular an explanation of the South Pyongan
situation.</LD>

<HD>Dietary Supplements Feed a Healthy Industry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"A Dose of Herbal Reform" (editorial, April 10) is way off the mark.
Yes, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) sponsored the 1994 Dietary Supplement
and Health Education Act, but it was the American people who pushed
it through--via one of the largest grass-roots responses ever seen on
Capitol Hill. Today, given our ailing health care system, the
American people want free access to their dietary supplements more
than ever. They want, whenever possible, natural alternatives to
prescription medications.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, there are some unscrupulous small-time outfits selling herbs
and steroids, but the dietary supplement industry is doing all it can
to follow good manufacturing practices. When your editorial describes
the makers of supplements as "spoiled" and "powerful," it is frankly
ridiculous. The pharmaceutical giants, engaged in the most profitable
business in the nation, are the ones with awesome power. They don't
want the competition and are trying to discredit, control and usurp
the dietary supplement industry. In the meantime, they push dangerous
drugs through the Food and Drug Administration, raise prices to
obscene levels, taint medical ethics by funding doctors and
researchers and, obviously, influence the media.</LD>
<LD>   Judith Plowden</LD>
<TE>   Venice</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Examples of hypocrisy from politicians are hardly rare, but the
example is clear in Hatch's unbending support for the dietary
supplement industry. Even though death and serious health problems
are documented from the use of certain dietary supplements, his
insistence is that the industry--which is mainly based in his own
state--remain free of any regulation and its products be treated as
food products. Yet Hatch is a staunch supporter of the federal war on
marijuana, a war where even a hint of suggesting regulation is
ridiculed as being preposterous. Any discussion on the subject of a
state's right to regulate the medical use of marijuana is summarily
dismissed, even though marijuana has never caused a single death;
quite to the contrary, it is a healing herb.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Sen. Hatch is beholden to his constituents in the dietary
supplement industry. Clear, also, is his service to the
pharmaceutical industry--a major donor to powerful people on both
sides of the aisle--in making sure sick people are prevented from
growing their own medicine or otherwise acquiring it from a
noncorporate source.</TE>

<LD>"Bilingual Charter School Hopes to Be a Model, in Any Language"
(April 9) states that in kindergarten and first grade at the LAUSD
Multicultural Learning Center, students are immersed in Spanish-only
instruction about 90% of the day. But why don't the Spanish-speaking
children and their families feel proud about their ability to learn
and speak perfect English? That's the goal for students from Russia
or Eastern Europe. They learn to speak English, and they can still
feel proud of their backgrounds.</LD>
<LD>   Why not teach English 90% of the day and Spanish 10%, while the
children are young enough to pick up English more easily? They return
to their homes and speak in Spanish, for the most part, so they get
little or no English reinforcement at home. Without excellent English
skills, we are ensuring that they will have difficulty competing for
well-paying jobs in the future.</LD>

<HD>Bertha Miller, 96; Resistance Worker Whose Story Has Been
Twice Told</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bertha Miller, a Polish-born Jew who worked in the French Resistance
while her husband was imprisoned by Nazis during World War II, has
died. She was 96.</LD>
<LD>   Miller, whose life story has been featured in two books, died
March 29 at her home in Berkeley after a short illness.</LD>
<LD>   Born Brucha Gutrajman, she immigrated to France as a young woman
to escape growing anti-Semitism in Poland. In Paris, she met and
married another Polish refugee, George Miller (originally Melszpajz).
They both worked in factories.</LD>
<TE>   Bertha was a bobbin winder, replacing bobbins on a knitting
machine in a clothing factory--a skill that later led to her four
decades of working in Los Angeles' garment district.</TE>
<TE>   As the war developed, George Miller joined the French army and was
soon imprisoned by the invading Germans and taken to a labor camp in
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   His wife stayed behind, sent their small daughter, Odette, to live
with a Catholic family in the countryside, and worked with the
Resistance to hide other Jewish children, relay messages that helped
damage the German war effort, and raise money for arms and
ammunition. Fearing capture, she eventually fled to the country
herself and lived quietly with her daughter in a small village until
the family was reunited in Paris at war's end.</TE>
<TE>   After the birth of their second daughter in 1949, the Millers
immigrated to Los Angeles. Their story was told in the memoir "Doors
to Madame Marie," published in 1997 by their older daughter, the late
Odette Meyers. The couple's 70-year marriage was also featured in the
1996 book, "Living Happily Ever After--Couples Talk About Lasting
Love."</TE>
<TE>   Bertha Miller, who learned to swim at 72, competed in senior
race-walking events well into her 80s and took classes in writing and
yoga into her 90s, had completed her own memoirs.</TE>
<TE>   The autobiography, still untitled, is scheduled to be published
late this year by Creative Arts Book Co. of Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by her husband, George; younger daughter,
Anne-Marie Miller, both of Berkeley; and three grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Dorothy Coates, 74; Gospel Singer and Songwriter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dorothy Love Coates, a singer and songwriter who wrote and recorded
such gospel favorites as "Get Away Jordan," "That's Enough" and "(You
Can't Hurry God) He's Right on Time," has died. She was 74.</LD>
<LD>   Coates died Tuesday in a Birmingham, Ala., hospital of heart
disease.</LD>
<LD>   Armed with a fierce voice and bluesy singing style, Coates was a
fixture on the gospel music scene for four decades, playing such
famed venues as New York's Apollo Theater and Carnegie Hall as well
as small halls and churches around the country. She also had small
parts in the movies "The Long Walk Home" and "Beloved," in which she
led a group of women in a gospel song.</LD>
<TE>   One of seven children and the daughter of a minister, Dorothy
McGriff grew up in a row house across the street from a Baptist
church in Birmingham. By age 10, she was playing piano for her
church. As a teenager, she sang in church choirs and started a gospel
group, the McGriff Singers.</TE>
<TE>   At 16, she married Willie Love, a singer with the Fairfield Four.
They were divorced 10 years later. Her second marriage, to Carl
Coates, a gospel music business manager, lasted 40 years until his
death in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Her career had taken a big step forward in her late teens when she
joined the Original Gospel Harmonettes. The group's early recordings
of "I'm Sealed," followed by "Get Away Jordan," placed the ensemble
in the top ranks of gospel singers.</TE>
<TE>   Over most of the next 25 years, the group made several successful
records and concert tours, performing songs written mainly by Dorothy
Coates. Other hits for the Harmonettes included "You Must Be Born
Again" and "No Hiding Place."</TE>
<TE>   After the Harmonettes disbanded in the early 1970s, Coates
continued to record and tour with her own group, Dorothy Love Coates
and Her Singers, which also featured her sister Lillian.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Cash and Ray Charles each recorded "That's Enough," and
Coates' song "No Hiding Place" was on the soundtrack to the movie
"Ghost." Mahalia Jackson and the Rev. James Cleveland each recorded
"(You Can't Hurry God) He's Right on Time." Andrae Crouch recorded
"Heaven," and the Blackwood Brothers did "Every Day Will Be Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Coates rejected efforts by record producers to
have her venture into more popular music in the manner of Aretha
Franklin. "They told me I had to stop singing gospel and cross over
to make a dollar," she told a Birmingham newspaper some years ago. "I
wouldn't do it. I decided to stay with my maker. There's nowhere else
we can go but to the Lord."</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by two daughters, two sisters, a brother and two
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Robert McGruder, 60; Journalist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Robert G. Mc- Gruder, executive editor of the Detroit Free Press and
a champion of diversity who broke racial barriers, died Friday of
cancer. He was 60.</LD>
<LD>   McGruder, a soft-spoken but strong and aggressive editor sometimes
called "Darth Vader" for his quiet intensity, died in a hospice in
suburban Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   The first black reporter for the Plain Dealer in Cleveland in
1963, McGruder became the first black executive editor of the Free
Press in 1996.</LD>
<TE>   In 1995, when he was managing editor of the Free Press and his
paper was in the midst of a long, bitter strike, McGruder became the
first black president of the Associated Press Managing Editors.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing colleagues at the group's national convention in Denver
the following year, he rejected reports of the demise of daily
newspapers, urging editors to give readers what they find "useful,
fresh and important to them.... That's news, news and news."</TE>
<TE>   McGruder also used the APME platform and the nationwide respect he
gained throughout his career to promote diversity in the newsroom.
Earlier this year he earned the award given by Wayne State University
to the journalist who best furthers the cause of a diversified media.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to respect and learn from diversity, and many of us have
a problem dealing with differences," he told fellow journalists at
the 1996 managing editors' convention in Denver. "Newspapers find it
hard to keep their lead because they cannot deal with it in their
newsrooms. We fail to respect the differences and the strengths of
our communities."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, when McGruder won the John S. Knight Gold Medal, the
highest honor given to an employee of Knight Ridder, the parent
company of the Free Press, he said: "I stand for diversity. I
represent the African Americans, Latinos, Arab Americans, Asians,
Native Americans, gays and lesbians, women, and all the others we
must see represented in our business offices, newsrooms and our
newspapers if we truly want to meet the challenge of serving our
communities."</TE>
<TE>   McGruder joined the Free Press in 1986 as deputy managing editor.
He was named managing editor-news in 1987 and managing editor in
1993.</TE>
<TE>   He became executive editor Jan. 1, 1996, when the strike was still
in progress and, as a former union member and negotiator in
Cleveland, often said: "The strike was easily the most painful time
in my life as a newspaperman."</TE>
<TE>   But he had spent a career and a lifetime overcoming obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   McGruder was born in Louisville, Ky., and grew up in Dayton, Ohio,
where his divorced mother worked two jobs, as teacher and librarian,
to send him to private school and enable him to graduate from Kent
State University.</TE>
<TE>   Stricken by polio at age 6, he nevertheless grew into a strong and
vibrant man who stood 6 foot 4. After he was diagnosed with cancer in
August 2000, he said he drew on the experience of his battle with
polio.</TE>
<TE>   He spent a summer working at the Dayton Journal Herald in 1963
before moving to the Plain Dealer, where--with time out for Army
service--he covered city government, politics and the civil rights
movement.</TE>
<TE>   McGruder and Allen Wiggins worked with former Cleveland Mayor Carl
B. Stokes to write "Promises of Power," a 1973 biography of Stokes,
who was the first black mayor of a major U.S. city.</TE>
<TE>   McGruder became city editor of the Plain Dealer in 1978 and
managing editor in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   He served for several years as a board member of the American
Society of Newspaper Editors and as a Pulitzer Prize nominating
juror.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife, Annette; his mother; a stepdaughter;
and a grandson.</TE>

<LD>Safet Zhulali, 59, Albania's deposed defense minister, died Saturday
in Tirana, Albania, of a heart attack.</LD>
<LD>   Zhulali was defense minister from 1992 to 1997 under former
President Sali Berisha of the Democratic Party. But he had to give up
his post in 1997 when Berisha's government was overthrown because its
fraudulent investment schemes collapsed.</LD>
<LD>   Tens of thousands of investors lost their life savings. Enraged
rioters stormed army depots, stealing weapons that were used in
street violence that killed some 2,000 people.</LD>
<TE>   The succeeding government, led by the Socialist Party, charged
Zhulali with crimes against humanity for his role during the crisis.
He spent a few weeks in jail.</TE>

Graham Evangelistic Assn., died Friday in Raleigh, N.C., of unstated

association took more than 150 trips to the Middle East to teach
Christianity.</LD>
<LD>   Gustafson officially retired in 1986, but continued to make
international trips on behalf of the evangelical group. He

<HD>K. Seetharamaiah, 87; Founded Communist Rebel Group in
India</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Kondapalli Seetharamaiah, 87, founder of a Maoist guerrilla group in
India, died Friday in Vijayawada in India's Andhra Pradesh State. No
cause of death was announced.</LD>
<LD>   Seetharamaiah began the People's War Group in 1980, but later had
a reported falling out with its other leaders.</LD>
<LD>   The rebel group, which claims to defend the rights of the poor,
remains active in southern and central India. Its goal is to create a
communist state. More than 6,000 people have died in rebel attacks
over the last two decades.</LD>
<TE>   In 1993, Seetharamaiah surrendered to police after his reported
break with other rebel leaders. He was jailed for two months, then
freed because of his poor health.</TE>
<TE>   A schoolteacher-turned-activist, Seetharamaiah joined the
Communist Party during India's freedom struggle against its British
colonial rulers. He left the party after it entered parliamentary
politics following India's independence in 1947.</TE>

<LD>You just never know where those camera shots of NBA fans dancing in
the aisles can lead. Would you believe an all-male dance team at
Dallas Maverick games?</LD>
<LD>   No, not those kind of male dancers, ladies. The Dallas Morning
News described them as "Clydesdales, not Chippendales."</LD>
<LD>   The Mavericks' ManiAACs (American Airlines Center) are scheduled
to shake their stuff--and perhaps the floor--at Dallas' first home
playoff game.</LD>
<TE>   A full-body photo was required with all applications on the
Maverick Web site.</TE>
<TE>   One candidate, 41-year-old Dr. Doug Smith, of suburban Plano,
describes himself as a "full-figured 6-1, 300 pounds."</TE>
<TE>   No word on whether Mo Vaughn has applied.</TE>
<TE>   Head case: Tommy Salo knows what's coming, but he is returning to
Sweden to play for his national hockey team at this month's world
championships.</TE>
<TE>   The Edmonton Oiler goaltender allowed a bizarre goal during the
Salt Lake City Olympics that sent Belarus to a big upset of Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never said no to Sweden before," Salo said. "I'm not going
to say no to Sweden now. I'm not worried about what happened."</TE>
<TE>   The powerful Swedes were upset by Belarus in the quarterfinals
when a 70-foot shot by Vladimir Kopat bounced wildly off Salo's head
and into the net with 2:24 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to be reminded of it every time.... The worst is over.
It can't get worse," Salo said.</TE>
<TE>   It's good to see Salo is keeping his head in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the major league record for pinch hits in a
career?</TE>
<TE>   Wheel crazy: Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong never
competes in the Paris-Roubaix cycling race, and for good reason.</TE>
<TE>   Mud, cobblestones and the risk of accident awaited the 194 riders
who started the 100th edition Sunday. More than a century after 48
men set out one spring morning for the first race, many of its
challenges remain unique even if the bikes, clothing, diet and
training have advanced.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden this year over 163 miles in northeastern France, a fifth of
the route covers narrow stretches of cobblestones, causing
bottlenecks, falls and punctures. Some crashes are serious.</TE>
<TE>   France's Philippe Gaumont didn't return to the sport until March
after breaking his leg last year.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have to be completely crazy to ride it," said 1999
winner Andrea Tafi. "But it does help."</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Perfect: Yao Ming played the perfect game Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   In the first game of the Chinese Basketball Assn. championship
round, the 7-foot-6 center, who's expected to be one of the top two
picks in the NBA draft, was 21 for 21 from the field in Shanghai's
127-125 loss to the Chinese Army team, Bayi. Yao finished with 49
points and 17 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Next month, Chinese officials will allow Yao to visit the U.S. and
work out for about a half-dozen teams. Chinese officials are hoping
he is drafted by a big-market team with a big Asian population.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Lenny Harris, with 151.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Retief Goosen, the runner-up at the Masters: "Do I
get a pair of green pants for finishing second?"</TE>

<HD>Venus Williams Learns Lesson and Beats Henin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Experience has been Venus Williams' best teacher.</LD>
<LD>   A slow start Sunday in the final of the Bausch &amp; Lomb
Championships at Amelia Island, Fla., didn't faze Williams. It only
made her more determined to rally and defeat second-seeded Justine
Henin for her fourth title this year.</LD>
<LD>   "Back in the day, I lost a lot of matches like these," the
top-seeded Williams said after overcoming fatigue and 60 unforced
errors to win the $585,000 clay court event, 2-6, 7-5, 7-6 (5).</LD>
<TE>   "I guess about two years ago it came to a point where I was tired
of losing. I was tired of heartbreak," Williams added. "I was tired,
not that I didn't deserve it, of watching other people win when I was
at the finish line."</TE>
<TE>   Williams was down a set and four games before working her way back
into the match. Twice, she was within two points of losing, but found
a way to keep going in the heat. It was her 16th title in the past
three seasons--and 25th overall--boosting her career earnings past
$9.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted it to look presentable. I didn't want to lose 6-2,
6-0," said Williams. "I got a game, then I got another. I kept
telling myself I wasn't losing today."</TE>
<TE>   Henin, playing her third match in 24 hours, served twice for the
championship. But she couldn't hold a 5-4 lead in the second set,
then faltered again when she had a chance to close after leading,
5-3, in the third. "I'm a little disappointed, but that's tennis,"
Henin said. "I'm only 19. I got nervous trying to finish the match. I
have to work on that."</TE>
<TE>   David Nalbandian of Argentina and Magui Serna of Spain won their
first titles, winning finals in the Estoril Open at Oeiras, Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   Nalbandian defeated Finland's Jarkko Nieminen, 6-4, 7-6 (5).
Serna, seeded fourth, beat German qualifier Anca Barna, 6-4,
6-2....Younes El Aynaoui of Morocco beat defending champion Guillermo
Canas of Argentina, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, to win the Grand Prix Hassan II
Open at Casablanca.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo scored twice in four minutes, helping move Inter Milan
closer to the Italian title while also strengthening Brazil's hopes
for the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Having spent much of two years on the sidelines because of knee
injuries, Ronaldo scored in the 79th and 83rd minutes at San Siro to
rally the league leader past Brescia, 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Those were his first goals since December. The FIFA player of the
year in 1996 and '97 has played in only seven of Inter's 31 league
games, but has five goals.</TE>
<TE>   AS Roma and Juventus also won. With three games left, Inter has 65
points, Roma 63 and Juventus 62. Roma beat AC Parma, 3-1; Juventus
defeated AC Milan, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy was named the
Professional Footballers' Assn. Player of the Year in a ceremony at
London. A poll of the pro players put him ahead of Arsenal's Thierry
Henry and Robert Pires, fellow Manchester United players David
Beckham and Roy Keane and Chelsea's Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.</TE>
<TE>   College Football</TE>
<TE>   With spring football entering its final week, USC's running game

<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Arsenal and Chelsea won FA Cup semifinals Sunday, setting up a
championship between London rivals in the showcase game of English
soccer.</LD>
<LD>   Arsenal beat Middlesbrough, 1-0, on an own goal by Gianluca Festa
minutes after he entered the game. Chelsea defeated Fulham, 1-0, on
John Terry's goal in the 42nd minute at Villa Park.</LD>
<LD>   The final is May 4 at Cardiff, Wales.</LD>
<TE>   Festa replaced Ugo Ehiogu in the 33rd minute at Old Trafford. Five
minutes later, he tried to clear an Arsenal corner kick only to prod
the ball past his own goalkeeper.</TE>
<TE>   It was the only goal Middlesbrough had conceded in this season's
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Arsenal gained a spot in the final for the second consecutive year
and the 15th time overall. The Gunners lost to Liverpool in last
season's final.</TE>
<TE>   Arsenal also leads the Premier League and is bidding to win the
league and FA Cup for the third time.</TE>
<TE>   This will be Chelsea's third final in six years, with titles in
1997 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Chelsea's score was a semblance of an own goal. Terry's angled
shot struck Louis Saha on the way in after Fulham failed to clear a
corner kick.</TE>
<TE>   The game ended with several players pushing and shoving each
other.</TE>

<HD>Mussina Is Satisfied With Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Mussina wasn't disappointed about not getting a perfect game
after retiring the first 16 batters--not after his previous Fenway
Park appearance last summer.</LD>
<LD>   "I've been within a strike, so I've got to be pretty close to be
upset about it," he said after the New York Yankees ended a four-game
losing streak with a 6-2 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Last Sept. 2, Mussina (3-0) retired the first 26 batters and had a
1-2 count on pinch-hitter Carl Everett, who blooped a single into
left field.</LD>
<TE>   Six days later at Yankee Stadium, he beat the Red Sox again,
giving up one run and three hits in six innings. In his two previous
starts this year, he yielded two runs and six hits in 15 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Mirabelli was Boston's first runner Sunday when he singled
with one out in the sixth. Mussina gave up four hits in the seventh,
including Manny Ramirez's two-run homer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always nice to get a hit," Mirabelli said, "but it was kind
of meaningless as far as the game went."</TE>
<TE>   The game had more than the usual meaning for closer Mariano
Rivera, who had a rare failure Saturday when he gave up Shea
Hillenbrand's homer in the eighth that gave Boston a 7-6 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera got the final four outs for his fifth save in six chances
as the Yankees moved back into the AL East lead, half a game ahead of
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "I watched the replay last night and I knew what I did wrong. I
slept well," Rivera said. "I was hoping to pitch today."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Wakefield (1-1) pitched six strong innings for Boston, leaving
with a 2-0 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "Mussina is on top of his game and I knew I'd have to pitch my
best to keep pace," Wakefield said. "I did that for six innings."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 9, Texas 7--Alex Rodriguez certainly did his share for the
Rangers at Arlington, Tex., hitting two homers and driving in five
runs, but it wasn't enough to prevent the Mariners from winning their
seventh in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Ruben Sierra, who went five for five against his former team, hit
a single that put the Mariners ahead to stay after they rallied from
a 5-1 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez had a two-run homer in the fourth and a three-run drive
in the sixth for his 21st career multihomer game. Rodriguez and
Ranger starter Kenny Rogers were participants in a fourth-inning
triple play, the first in the majors this season.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle, which had 18 hits, scored eight runs against the bullpen
to improve to 7-0 in the road. The Mariners set an AL record with 59
road victories last season.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied, 7-7, in the eighth, Mike Cameron drew a walk
from Rudy Seanez (0-2), took second on a wild pitch and scored on
Sierra's single.</TE>
<TE>   Shigetoshi Hasegawa (2-0) gave up two hits in 12/3 relief innings
and Kazuhiro Sasaki got four outs for his third save.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 9, Chicago 4--Melvin Mora hit a three-run homer and
scored three times and Jay Gibbons hit a two-homer to lead the
Orioles at Comiskey Park.</TE>
<TE>   Calvin Maduro (1-1) pitched in and out of trouble over six innings
for the Orioles. Maduro gave up three runs, seven hits and two walks.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Lee homered for the White Sox, who did not get another good
outing from Dan Wright. Wright (1-1) gave up five runs, five hits and
walked three in two-plus innings.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbons, who had three hits, hit a leadoff double in the third,
and Wright was relieved by Lorenzo Barcelo. One out later, Marty
Cordova hit a run-scoring single.</TE>
<TE>   The Orioles scored four more in the fourth. David Segui hit a
two-run single and Gibbons hit his third homer, a two-run shot to
right to make it 9-2.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 5, Toronto 4--Ben Grieve's run-scoring single in the
10th inning at St. Petersburg, Fla., prevented the Blue Jays from
completing a series sweep and extending their winning streak to five
games.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Winn hit a two-out double off Pasqual Coco (0-1). After
Steve Cox was intentionally walked and Greg Vaughn walked on a 3-2
pitch, Grieve singled down the left-field line.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto's Jose Cruz Jr. hit a two-run homer in the sixth and tied
the score, 4-4, with a run-scoring double in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay second baseman Felix Escalona saved two runs when he
dove to the left to grab Vernon Wells' hard grounder, and then threw
Wells out at first to end the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Devil Ray starter Wilson Alvarez left in the sixth inning with a
pulled rib-cage muscle.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez went down to one knee and grabbed his right side after
making a 2-2 pitch to Carlos Delgado.</TE>
<TE>   The left-hander was making his second start after sitting out the
previous two seasons while recovering from a partially torn left
rotator cuff. He gave up two runs and two hits in 52/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City at Cleveland--Rain finally slowed down the Indians,
whose winning streak was on hold at 10 after their series finale
against the Royals was postponed by bad weather. No makeup date was
announced.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland (11-1) is off to its best start since opening 1966 at
14-1.</TE>

<HD>It Just Keeps Getting Worse for the Tigers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Even with a two-run lead in the eighth inning, the Detroit Tigers
couldn't win.</LD>
<LD>   For that matter, they couldn't even keep it close Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Pinch-hitter David Ortiz, who was hitless in his last 16 at-bats,
hit a tiebreaking, bases-loaded triple during an eight-run eighth
inning and the winless Tigers lost their 11th consecutive game, 13-7,
to the Minnesota Twins.</LD>
<TE>   "It's getting tougher," Bobby Higginson said. "You keep thinking
when you're coming into the ballpark that today's going to be the
day. It's getting a little old."</TE>
<TE>   Craig Paquette homered twice, had four hits and made a nice
defensive play at third to help the Tigers go ahead, 7-5--their first
eighth-inning lead since April 3 against Tampa Bay, when they lost,
2-1, in 12 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "I literally thought to myself, today is the day," Tiger starter
Steve Sparks said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got the ball bouncing our way. I thought we'd cruise
through there. I thought we'd cruise through there, especially when
Paquette hit that home run."</TE>
<TE>   But it was Ortiz who broke a slump, not the Tigers.</TE>
<TE>   A.J. Pierzynski singled off Jose Paniagua leading off in the
eighth, Matt Anderson (0-1) relieved and pinch-hitter Bobby Kielty
tied the game hitting a homer on the third pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "My fastball wasn't there, but we're all professionals. We've got
find something else to get them out with," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult, but it's 7-7 if we get out of that inning and
we've got the momentum. I just couldn't shut them down after that
homer."</TE>
<TE>   Jacque Jones and Cristian Guzman followed with singles, Doug
Mientkiewicz walked and Ortiz tripled to right for a 10-7 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, when I face him, he tries to get me with the
off-speed," he said. "That one I hit was slider."</TE>
<TE>   Torii Hunter added an RBI single off Juan Acevedo, who later
walked Kielty with the bases loaded and gave up Jones' sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a perfect example of why you have to play a full
ballgame," Twin Manager Ron Gardenhire said. "We were fighting and
clawing pretty much the whole game to stay in it."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit, which replaced Manager Phil Garner with Luis Pujols after
six games, is off to its worst start since going 0-13 in 1920 and the
worst in the major leagues since the 1997 Chicago Cubs began 0-14.
The Tigers are off today, then start a series at home against Tampa
Bay on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   J.C. Romero (2-0), the fifth of six Minnesota pitchers, got one
out for the win.</TE>
<TE>   Randall Simon also homered for the Tigers, who overcame a 5-2
deficit by taking a four-run lead in the sixth off Joe Mays. Simon's
three-run homer tied the game, and Robert Fick drove in Paquette with
a single off Jack Cressend for a 6-5 lead.</TE>
<TE>   ''We hit the ball well today,'' Pujols said. ''Sparks gave us some
good innings. We saw some good things today.''</TE>

<HD>Victory Is Music to the Angels' Ears</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Anaheim ends its losing streak at six, Anderson
homers and Spiezio's single breaks tie in 4-1 win over Oakland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Music blared inside the Angel clubhouse at Edison Field on Sunday
afternoon, the recently unfamiliar sound spurred by an unfamiliar
result.</LD>
<LD>   An Angel victory.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels ended a losing streak at six games and won for only the
second time at home by defeating the Oakland Athletics, 4-1, before a
sun-splashed crowd of 32,881 at Edison Field.</LD>
<TE>   It was the Angels' first victory since beating the Texas Rangers
on April 6 at Arlington, Texas. It was their first home victory since
April 2 when they defeated the Cleveland Indians in the second game
of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely nice to come into a clubhouse with music on,"
said first baseman Scott Spiezio, who broke a 1-1 tie in the fourth
inning with a run-scoring single against A's starter Barry Zito.</TE>
<TE>   While it was rock group Van Halen that thumped from the clubhouse
speakers, the Angels' play was more characteristic of smooth jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran right-hander Kevin Appier (1-1) turned in his second
consecutive solid outing, giving up one run, four hits and striking
out five in seven innings. Dennis Cook pitched the eighth and Al
Levine earned his third save with a perfect ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Garret Anderson hit a first-inning home run for the
second consecutive game and also made two outstanding catches.
Shortstop David Eckstein, the Angels' leadoff man, had three hits,
including a run-scoring double in the fifth inning, and also scored a
run and played solid defense.</TE>
<TE>   "Our challenge is to really do this every game," Angel Manager
Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   They had not done it for a while against the A's. Oakland went
into the game having won nine consecutive games against the Angels,
who had had not defeated Oakland since July 5.</TE>
<TE>   Appier set the tone Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up a fourth-inning home run to Eric Chavez that tied the
score, 1-1, but was otherwise in control. He threw 108 pitches, 65
for strikes, and benefited from two spectacular catches by Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   With a runner on in the sixth, Anderson ventured far to his left
and extended his body to nab a sinking line drive hit by Scott
Hatteberg.</TE>
<TE>   He also leaped to catch a fly ball hit toward the left-field fence
by Mike Colangelo with a runner on in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   "Every win is great, but after the way things have been going, we
were searching for something to turn things around," said Appier, who
lowered his earned-run average to 2.37. "This is only one game, but
the way the guys played out there was incredible and hopefully this
is the start of a real good streak."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson went into the game with seven hits in 18 at-bats against
Zito (0-1), who had won his last nine regular-season decisions.
Anderson's success against the former USC All-American continued when
he smacked a 2-and-1 pitch into the right-field seats in the second
inning.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez hit his American League-leading sixth home run in the
fourth to tie the score, but the Angels answered with a run when Troy
Glaus drew a leadoff walk, moved to second on a two-out single by
Bengie Molina and scored on Spiezio's hit to left field. Spiezio, who
struck out in the second inning, was 0 for 8 against Zito before the
single.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels extended the lead on consecutive doubles by Jeff
DaVanon and Eckstein in the fifth. Eckstein, who is batting .340, put
the Angels ahead, 4-1, when he scored from third base on a nubber hit
back to the mound by Glaus.</TE>
<TE>   "Eck comes out and plays the same style of game no matter the
circumstances," Scioscia said. "Offensively, he sets the tone."</TE>
<TE>   The A's threatened in the eighth after Cook replaced Appier. With
one out, Cook walked Jeremy Giambi and Frank Menechino. Hatteberg
then hit a foul pop-up that was caught by Glaus in front of the Angel
dugout.</TE>
<TE>   That brought up Chavez, who hit a 1-and-0 pitch to the
center-field wall where Darin Erstad made the catch to end the
inning.</TE>
<TE>   "One win can't do a lot," Anderson said. "But it does set in our
minds that we can win against good teams."</TE>

<LD>The Angels' 4-1 victory over the Oakland Athletics on Sunday improved
their record to 4-8 and buoyed their hopes of contending for the
American League West championship.</LD>
<LD>   For inspiration in ways to overcome a slow start, all the Angels
had to do was look across the field.</LD>
<LD>   Last season, the Athletics began the season with high
expectations, only to start 8-18.</LD>
<TE>   The A's recovered to finish with 102 victories and earn the AL
wild-card spot.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland Manager Art Howe said he sympathizes somewhat with the
Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel for them because I know what it's like," Howe said before
Sunday's game. "On the other hand, I'm glad it's them and not us."</TE>
<TE>   Howe said the unbalanced schedule, which has AL West teams playing
19 consecutive games against each other, can work both ways.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're playing well, it allows you to put some distance
between you and the other clubs," said Howe, whose team is 8-5. "If
you don't play well coming out of the blocks, it's an uphill battle
the rest of the way. It's tough to overcome. We were phenomenal last
year. I don't know if you can expect that kind of performance very
often, but it can be done."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel pitcher Jarrod Washburn said there was something positive
that came out of his 4-2/3 inning performance Saturday night in a 7-2
loss to the A's.</TE>
<TE>   "The only good thing is that I did make an adjustment after I gave
up a home run [to Eric Chavez]," said Washburn, who is 0-2 with a
6.00 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   "I started getting ahead of hitters and hitting more spots.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, I had already lost the game before figuring it
out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Closer Troy Percival threw in the bullpen for seven minutes and
will probably throw in a simulated game Tuesday or Wednesday as he
progresses toward becoming activated Friday or Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Percival, who has been on the 15-day disabled list since April 3
because of a strained muscle in his rib cage, said he threw a few
pitches with 100% effort but most were in the 90%-95% range.</TE>
<TE>   Percival expects to be utilized in save situations immediately
when he returns.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't need to ease my way back," he said. "Last year there were
numerous times I had 10 days off. There is no difference here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Utility man Benji Gil, on the disabled list since April 6 because
of a sprained left ankle, is continuing daily treatment and is hoping
to return soon.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple of days ago, it felt like I took a step backward, but
it's much better today." Gil said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Chavez home run usually results in a victory for the A's.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland had won 23 consecutive games in which Chavez homered
before Sunday</TE>

<LD>The Chicago Cubs activated outfielder Moises Alou from the disabled
list after their 5-1 victory Sunday in Pittsburgh.</LD>
<LD>   To make room for Alou, the Cubs sent outfielder Mario Encarnacion
to triple-A Iowa of the Pacific Coast League.</LD>
<LD>   Encarnacion went hitless in two at-bats Sunday and is 0 for 7 with
the Cubs.</LD>
<TE>   Alou, one of Chicago's major off-season additions, has not played
yet this season because of a strained right calf.</TE>
<TE>   He spent the weekend on a rehabilitation assignment at Class-A
Daytona of the Florida State League, going five for eight, including
four singles, a double and two RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Alou, who played for Houston last year, went on the disabled list
April 5, retroactive to March 31.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Matt Stairs of the Milwaukee Brewers will see a heart
specialist in Milwaukee today as a precautionary measure.</TE>
<TE>   Stairs, who experienced chest pains and an accelerated heartbeat
before Friday's game in San Francisco, has been getting chest pains
since his early 20s, but hadn't had a problem for more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't like waking up at 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning with
my chest getting tight, and my heart going 100 mph," said Stairs, who
doubled in a run as a pinch-hitter in Sunday's 4-3 victory over the
Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Stairs said he has been examined in the past and pronounced fit.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's pain was described as an anxiety attack by Giants' team
doctors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle third baseman Jeff Cirillo was struck by a batted ball
during batting practice before the Mariners' game against the Texas
Rangers at Arlington, Texas, and was scratched from the lineup. The
injury was not considered to be serious.</TE>
<TE>   Cirillo was standing to the left of the batting cage when he was
hit in the head by a ball that ricocheted off the pitchers'
protective screen.</TE>
<TE>   He was on the ground for several minutes before being helped to
his feet.</TE>
<TE>   He walked wobbly-legged to the clubhouse, where team medical
personnel treated a cut above his left ear.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners said Cirillo--who has gone 96 games without an error,
two short of the major league record for third basemen--was scratched
as a precautionary measure, but probably would be available to play
if needed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Catcher Michael Barrett and second baseman Jose Vidro of the
Montreal Expos did not play because of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Barrett left Saturday's game because of a strained right hip and
Vidro left with a strained left groin. Both players are listed as
day-to-day.</TE>

<HD>Kings' Next Stop: Avalanche Country</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scenarios varied as to where the Kings would land for the opening two
games in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Detroit, St.
Louis, Chicago, Colorado, San Jose. All were possible destinations.</LD>
<LD>   About an hour after the Kings held off the Mighty Ducks, 1-0, at
Staples Center Sunday, travel plans were finally in place. The Kings'
first-round series would open where their playoff run ended a year
ago: Denver.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings, who finished with 95 points and earned the seventh seed
in the Western Conference, will face the defending champion Colorado
Avalanche in Game 1 Thursday at 7 p.m. PDT.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, from Coach Andy Murray's seat, the final day of the
regular season was not about which team the Kings were going to draw,
but which team was going to draw the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone is licking their chops to play us," Murray
said. "It's not la-la land here in L.A. any more.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a time when the Stanley Cup was viewed as something for
Colorado, Dallas, Detroit, New Jersey, teams like that. That circle
now includes the L.A. Kings, it includes the Vancouver Canucks. The
circle has eight teams in the Western Conference that can win the
Stanley Cup."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, no one was hoping to be that No. 8 team and open the
playoffs in Detroit, home of several future NHL hall of famers. The
Kings made sure they were not bound for the Motor City, getting past
the Ducks in front of 18,349, their 19th consecutive sellout.</TE>
<TE>   Goalie Jamie Storr, starting for only the second time in 22 games,
stopped 23 shots for his second shutout. Ziggy Palffy chipped in a
power-play goal three minutes into the third period. And the Kings
made do with just five defensemen, as both Mathieu Schneider and
Jaroslav Modry were too sick to play.</TE>
<TE>   That was all the Kings needed to close out the season with the
fourth-highest point total in franchise history. They are in the
playoffs for the third consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if there was always an expectation here in terms of
winning," Murray said. "When you hear [players in] Colorado, San Jose
and Detroit saying what a tough team the Kings are and that we're
their rivals, those are good things to hear. I would prefer to have
the pressure to win than be on the other side of it."</TE>
<TE>   The other side is the Ducks, although they, too, can claim some
success. The Ducks did not finish last in the conference, as they did
last year, but tied for 13th after a 15-13-2 run in their last 30
games. Still, the Ducks missed the playoffs for the seventh time in
nine seasons.</TE>
<TE>   There was a point where the Ducks were ahead of the Kings in the
standings, back on Nov. 8. That changed rapidly as the Kings were
able to overcome a poor start by going 32-13-7-2 since Dec. 8.</TE>
<TE>   "We were outside looking in until December," King defenseman
Mattias Norstrom said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks still have their noses pressed against the playoff
glass. But they did match the Kings stride for stride Sunday. Both
teams were business as usual on the power play, which provided the
margin of victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have the NHL's worst power play and were scoreless in
five tries.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings finished with the league's top power play and showed why
early in the third period. With Aris Brimanis off for holding the
stick, Jason Allison circled behind the net and tried to jam in a
shot. Duck goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere made the save, but had no
chance on the rebound, as the net was left wide open for Palffy.</TE>
<TE>   It was Palffy's team-high 15th power-play goal. It was Allison's
league-high 32nd power-play assist.</TE>
<TE>   Storr took care of the rest in extending the Kings' home unbeaten
streak to 11 games (9-0-2). He wasn't tested often, but turned away
good opportunities. That included a sprawling save in the second
period against Steve Rucchin. "When you sit that much you don't play
if you sit back in practice," right wing Ian Laperriere said. "Jamie
showed today how hard he works in practice."</TE>
<TE>   His reward is to go back to the bench for the playoffs, as Felix
Potvin will start against the Avalanche. Storr and the Kings can only
hope he will have a front-row seat for a couple of months.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to be happy with just going one or two rounds,"
King forward Adam Deadmarsh said. "That's not why we wanted to make
the playoffs."</TE>

<HD>Simply Put, Lakers Let One Get Away</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Playing here is harder than it looks, so if the Lakers have to come
back for the playoffs, the Portland Trail Blazers will have Sunday to
remember themselves by.</LD>
<LD>   It should be noted that as the final, inconsequential points were
being scored, as the Lakers were done for good, 128-120, after two
overtimes at the Rose Garden, Ruben Patterson was standing on the
scorer's table. His fists were over his head, a smile was over his
face, and his emotions were over the top, perfect for a town that
can't stand what the Lakers have become, not to mention the bloated
Trail Blazers.</LD>
<LD>   Trail Blazer guard Bonzi Wells, who had a team-high 33 points,
scored six points in the second overtime and Steve Kerr made a
critical three-pointer for the points that eventually beat the
Lakers.</LD>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal scored 36 points, but missed four of six shots
after regulation ended at 105-105, and Kobe Bryant had no points and
three turnovers in the two overtime periods. He missed nine of 15
shots and scored 23 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are 56-24. They can hold their No. 3 playoff seed by
winning at Staples Center tonight against Seattle and Wednesday
against Sacramento. If they do, they would open defense of their
back-to-back titles against Portland in a best-of-five series
expected to begin Sunday in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, the Lakers said it didn't matter that they were outplayed
at all the crucial times, that they were outdone in the dirty little
corners of a game spent on the edge of frantic. There were five
technical fouls assessed, two in the second quarter that forced the
ejection of Scottie Pippen and caused the hurling of Bill Walton
dolls--Sunday's giveaway--to the floor. There was a flagrant foul.
There were dust-ups and glares and all the things you'd expect ... in
the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a playoff game," said Patterson, who had seven offensive
rebounds and 10 in all. "The win gives us confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Of course it was important to the Trail Blazers. While they begged
otherwise, the Lakers appeared to be as mystified as the Trail
Blazers were jubilant. Coach Phil Jackson lowered his head and said,
"We gave it away twice, in regulation and the first overtime, so I
thought it was appropriate that it finished the way it did. You can't
have that many lives out there on this court."</TE>
<TE>   It would be his only statement, and it would be twice as much as
O'Neal would say. He suffered a hyper-flexed knee in the fourth
quarter, stayed on his back for a while, but stayed on the floor. He
played 49 minutes and Bryant played 51, both season-highs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all right," O'Neal said as he left.</TE>
<TE>   They went to the first overtime when Rasheed Wallace made a
three-pointer with 2.5 seconds remaining, and the second when Derek
Fisher made two free throws with eight-tenths of a second remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "We had good looks, but did not knock them down," said Robert
Horry, who missed a straight-on three-point attempt at the regulation
buzzer. "This was a jacked-up game, from the officiating to the plays
that we ran. It was just a wacky game."</TE>
<TE>   The thing is, with the Lakers insisting that they'd found a
playoff gait, the Trail Blazers did the difficult things to prevail.</TE>
<TE>   They came from 94-84 down in regulation. And they came from
113-105 down in the first overtime.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers built leads that the Trail Blazers overcame. They built
momentum that the Trail Blazers ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, it was the Trail Blazers who pushed first, they who ran
off to a lead in the second overtime, and the Lakers wouldn't come
back. Wells made rainbow three-pointers to rally the Trail Blazers
back in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   "Bonzi played extremely well," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   And Patterson?</TE>
<TE>   "He's a garbage player who gets garbage points," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was Patterson's energy, however, that helped drive the Trail
Blazers. The Lakers had a 10-point lead with 5:42 left in regulation,
and lost it. They had a four-point lead with 27.2 seconds left in
regulation, and lost that too. The defense that carried them to three
consecutive victories and a sense they were regaining their playoff
legs? The Lakers allowed 35 fourth-quarter points, 18 by Wells, most
on wide-open attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bryant insisted, "We're close. We're getting there. We
played pretty well."</TE>
<TE>   They have two games. A few practices. A week.</TE>
<TE>   "We maybe underestimated how much of a cushion we needed," Rick
Fox said. "They kept fighting.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems an unlikely scenario to be sitting here talking about a
loss."</TE>
<TE>   Patterson, of course, happily accepted some credit for Bryant's
off game. He had 17 points, 10 rebounds and three steals, and again
was very physical against Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "You all know the situation," he said. "I know his moves. I kind
of wore him down out there. That's what you try to do against good
players."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Bryant appeared to fall off as the game rushed on,
sometimes without him. Bryant dismissed it, however.</TE>
<TE>   "Certain parts we didn't play well and we let it get away," he
said. "Defensively we let them get too many layups. They got too many
open looks.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel fine. It's a game we let slip away, and we know that. We
just want to win these next two games."</TE>

<DH>Auto racing: A pit accident and his pit strategy pave win
at Long Beach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you like high-speed passing on the race track, the 28th running of
the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach was no place to be.</LD>
<LD>   But if you like pit strategy and controversial pit accidents,
Sunday was a great day.</LD>
<LD>   The only time there was a pass on the track for the lead during 90
laps around the 1.97-mile seaside circuit was when Brazil's Cristiano
da Matta swept past pole-sitter Jimmy Vasser on the outside going
through the first turn of the first lap.</LD>
<TE>   Da Matta appeared to be a runaway winner until he was taken out in
the pits by Mexico's Adrian Fernandez. Vasser should have taken over
the leader's mantle, but he was snookered by Michael Andretti and the
Motorola crew.</TE>
<TE>   The veteran Andretti, who won the race in 1986 and whose father
Mario won it three times, finished 0.466 seconds ahead of Vasser as
U.S. drivers took the first two positions in a CART race for the
first time since 1996 when Andretti and Bobby Rahal ran one-two at
Vancouver. Andretti was driving a Honda-powered Reynard for Barry
Green, Vasser a Ford Cosworth-Lola for Rahal.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that it was mostly a parade race, the huge crowd loved
it as two Americans battled for the win over the final laps. Grand
Prix officials announced a three-day attendance of 210,000, of which
probably 90,000 were jammed around the downtown circuit Sunday
despite cool, foggy weather.</TE>
<TE>   Vasser was quick to admit that he was probably asleep at the
switch after making his final pit stop, not thinking about the two
drivers who did not pit at that time--Andretti and Italy's Max Papis.</TE>
<TE>   "I never gave Michael or [third-place finisher] Max a thought in
the equation when I made my last pit stop," Vasser said. "All I was
thinking about were Kenny Brack and the other guys who had been
chasing me. So we assumed we were going to pick up the pace car and
be in the lead. I slowed a little to save fuel, but I should have
hustled the car up to the pace car.</TE>
<TE>   "They just had the right strategy today. It goes to show you that
sometimes the fastest car doesn't always win. I think Da Matta had
the car to beat, but he had trouble too. That's what makes racing so
exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Vasser and the other race leaders pitted on Lap 61, but Andretti
and Papis, who had been out of sequence earlier, did not pit until
Lap 64.</TE>
<TE>   "When you start at the back of the pack [15th] you have to do some
gambling, and that's just what we did," said the 39-year-old
Andretti. "I had clean laps when I stayed out [after Vasser pitted]
and I drove as hard as I could. We had a great car, but we had to
have some great luck too. If we'd had to come in a lap or two sooner,
we might never have made it, but when I ran my fastest laps I knew
Jimmy and the other guys were on cold tires."</TE>
<TE>   Due to mandatory pit stops every 29 laps, Andretti was due to come
in on Lap 64 and as luck would have it, rookie Mario Dominguez of
Mexico hit the tire wall in the first turn and brought out a full
course yellow.</TE>
<TE>   With Vasser dawdling along in what he thought was the lead,
Andretti and Papis came flying out of the pits still in front.</TE>
<TE>   With 29 laps still remaining, Vasser passed Papis and looked as if
he might reel in Andretti, but once he got close he could not get by.</TE>
<TE>   "This place is very special for me, this is where I won my first
race, back in 1986," said Andretti. "It's also special to have Jimmy
next to me, two Americans on the podium. You don't see that very
often."</TE>
<TE>   Then he looked at Papis and added, "And a great day for Italians
too."</TE>
<TE>   "This was more than a podium finish," said Papis. "It is like a
win for Sigma Autosport because it is their best finish ever. And we
did it without even being in the car since [the last race in] Mexico
more than a month ago, and because we did not test, and because we
have only one car and no backup."</TE>
<TE>   It was the 42nd career win for Andretti, the all-time CART leader
and third behind father Mario (52) and A.J. Foyt (67) in open-wheel
Indy-type car victories.</TE>
<TE>   Had there not been a pit accident on Lap 33, however, there
probably would be no need for discussion of race tactics by either
Andretti or Vasser.</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta, who had led by as many as eight seconds and seemed
unbeatable while seeking his fourth consecutive victory, was exiting
the pits when Fernandez was coming in. When Fernandez dove into his
pit stall, he cut off Da Matta, forcing the leader's car into the
wall where he rammed a stack of tires. It took about 10 seconds for
Da Matta's Newman-Haas crew to push his car back into position and
get it restarted.</TE>
<TE>   This was enough to drop the Brazilian to 16th place, from where he
wasn't able to contend again. He finished eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta blamed the incident not on Fernandez, but on poor pit
selection by his team.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we made a mistake to choose the pit spot [close to the
pit entry], and we learned from our experience today," he said. "If
you are running well in the race, you pit and then have to exit your
box when everyone else is coming in. There is a lot more possibility
that something is going to go wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw Adrian coming in as I was merging from my pit box. I didn't
expect him to brake and turn in so quickly. I don't blame him, and I
also don't think I did anything wrong. We were hooked up today, but
being in the wrong end of pit lane bit us."</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez, the only car owner-driver in the race, blamed Da
Matta's crew for the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "They called Da Matta out when I was coming in, and I was already
ahead of him," the veteran Mexican driver said. "They just threw him
right in front of me. Of course, we lost a lot of time and some
positions too."</TE>
<TE>   Said Tom Anderson, managing director of Fernadez's team: "If
someone would have said that Cristiano da Matta would be parked in
our pits during one of our stops, I would have found that a little
hard to believe, but in essence that's what happened."</TE>
<TE>   The blow was not only to Da Matta's Newman-Haas team, but also to
Toyota, which was hoping that he would bring the manufacturer its
first victory in the race it has sponsored for the last 28 years. The
first Toyota finisher was Brack, in fourth.</TE>

<KH>THE 66TH MASTERS</KH>
<HD>Two Straight Jackets</HD>
<DH>Golf: Businesslike Woods jumps ahead early in final round,
avoids trouble and cruises to victory at Augusta for second year in
row.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>There was nothing really flashy about how Tiger Woods won his third
Masters ... if you don't count birdies on two of the first three
holes or chipping in at the sixth or knocking a pitching wedge to two
feet at the 15th to take a five-shot lead with three holes left.</LD>
<LD>   No, Woods was all business Sunday at Augusta National Golf Club,
and the record will show that business was good.</LD>
<LD>   He wound up with a three-shot victory over Retief Goosen and it
couldn't have been any more workmanlike if he had put on overalls and
punched a time clock on his way out of the locker room.</LD>
<TE>   It wasn't as if Woods' one-under closing round of 71 had the earth
shaking under everybody's feet, but it seems clear that something was
shaking the other guys out there, because almost from the start, no
one got close enough to see what color shirt he was wearing.</TE>
<TE>   Davis Love III said there's something not so funny going on.</TE>
<TE>   "He's like Nicklaus, like Palmer," Love said of Woods. "He's
playing great golf [but] we're not putting it to him. There are guys
who can do it, but just aren't doing it. Something's going on with
him that's not going on with us."</TE>
<TE>   What's going on with Woods is that he is the dominant figure in
golf, which isn't exactly news, although his victory Sunday at sloshy
Augusta National should serve as a jarring reminder</TE>
<TE>   Woods, 26, has won six of the last 10 major championships and now
has seven in all, tying him with some of the greatest names in the
history of golf--Bobby Jones, Sam Snead, Gene Sarazen, Harry Vardon
and Arnold Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   Woods is only the third to win the Masters in consecutive years,
equaling Jack Nicklaus in 1965-66 and Nick Faldo in 1989-90. His
three Masters titles match Jimmy Demaret, Snead, Gary Player and
Faldo. He is one behind Palmer and halfway to Nicklaus' record of six
Masters championships.</TE>
<TE>   Experience counts, said Woods, especially his experience at the
Masters.</TE>
<TE>   "I think going into today, it's a big relief knowing the fact that
no matter what happens, I'm still a champion here and I've done it
before," Woods said. "You know what it takes to win here. I know how
to handle my emotions and being in the final group here at Augusta
[and] you go out there and just play."</TE>
<TE>   His 32nd PGA Tour victory also cemented Woods' reputation as one
of the greatest front-runners of all time. He is 23-2 after holding
or sharing the 54-hole lead. And one more thing: Woods has been in
the last group on the last day of a major seven times ... and he is
7-0.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the beefed-up Augusta National was a significant factor
because of its new length. But the rain Friday and Saturday that
softened the greens and made the course seem even longer was equally
important to the outcome, because it played right into the
long-hitting Woods' hands. He averaged 293.8 yards off the tee.</TE>
<TE>   Tied with Goosen when the day began, Woods took his first lead of
the tournament when Goosen pulled his drive and made a bogey at the
first hole. When Woods hit a wedge to four feet and made the putt to
birdie the second hole, then followed it up with a pitching wedge to
seven and another birdie at the third, Woods led Goosen and Vijay
Singh by three shots.</TE>
<TE>   From there, Woods just buttoned up his three-piece suit, didn't do
anything stupid, played to the fat parts of the greens and watched
everyone around him fall by the wayside. Goosen was four over through
11. Through nine, Phil Mickelson--who would finish third--was no
better than par.</TE>
<TE>   Goosen, who shot a 74 Sunday, said Woods has earned a place in
golf's highest circles.</TE>
<TE>   "Besides Jack Nicklaus, Tiger is the best player," Goosen said.
"Give him a couple more years and I think Tiger will be even greater
than Jack Nicklaus. It's just a matter of time. He's hitting the ball
so well, and with great imagination."</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Els dropped out when he triple-bogeyed the par-five 13th,
hitting his drive into the trees and his second shot into Rae's
Creek. He tied for fifth with Padraig Harrington. Singh disappeared
when he bogeyed the 14th and then made a nine at the par-five 15th,
twice knocking balls into the water.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the end of that," said Singh, who finished seventh.</TE>
<TE>   There were more misadventures. Sergio Garcia shot a 75 and
finished eighth. Thomas Bjorn shot a 77 and tied for 18th. Jose Maria
Olazabal played the front in one over and was fourth despite three
birdies on a solid back side.</TE>
<TE>   As for Mickelson, he was turned back again in what he called his
"quest" for a major title. Mickelson is 0 for 39 in majors, but this
was his 15th top-10 finish in those Grand Slam events.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel like it was a missed opportunity," he said. "I
played very solid golf, but I didn't have that explosive spurt to
vault me up on the leaderboard."</TE>
<TE>   At the top of the leaderboard, Woods continued on his way, trying
to do the right thing. He said he didn't feel he had won the
tournament when he chipped in from 30 feet from the back of the green
for a birdie at the sixth, but most everyone else felt that way.</TE>
<TE>   He bogeyed the 11th when his nine-iron second shot missed the
green right and he missed a six-footer for par. At the 13th, Woods
laid up and made his par. He also laid up at the 15th--the hole that
sunk Singh--and rolled in a two-footer for birdie.</TE>
<TE>   By then, it was all over except for the matter of slipping into
the green jacket for a third time. It didn't matter that he drove
into the trees at the 17th and made a bogey, only that he made it
through the round without twisting an ankle or something.</TE>
<TE>   He finished the tournament at 12-under 276.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson said it's faulty thinking to wait for Woods to stumble.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about Tiger is that he's the only leader that you don't
have the hope he'll falter," he said. "When other guys are up there,
you know that if you can just stay around there, there's a good
chance they might come back two or three shots. But Tiger doesn't
ever seem to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Woods said he didn't just mail it in after he took his lead, not
with so much trouble all over the place on the back nine. He said he
thought it was a lot tighter than most people thought.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that everyone thinks everybody laid down," Woods said.
"That's not how it was out there."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not, but even if everyone wasn't lying down, there was only
one player who stood up when it counted, the one in the green jacket.</TE>

<TE>   2002: Tied for the lead going into the final round, Woods birdied
two of the first three holes and never let anyone closer than two
strokes the rest of the way. He closed with a one-under 71 to claim a
three-stroke victory over U.S. Open champion Retief Goosen.</TE>
<TE>   2001: Woods shot a final-round 68, including a birdie on the final
hole, to finish at 16-under 272 for a two-shot win over David Duval.
The victory meant he was the current champion in each of the four
majors.</TE>
<TE>   1997: Woods humiliated the world's best golfers, shooting 18-under
270 (the lowest score in tournament history) and finishing 12 shots
ahead of runner-up Tom Kite. It was the largest margin of victory at
a major in the 20th century and second only to Old Tom Morris'
13-shot triumph in the 1862 British Open.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Should Not Elbow Aside Concerns</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Just as they strongly insist that Kevin Brown's accelerated return
from elbow surgery wasn't dictated by the highly-paid pitcher--"We
reacted to how he was feeling and what he told us but he wasn't the
conductor of the orchestra," General Manager Dan Evans was saying
Sunday--it would be a surprise if the Dodgers were to concede they
are walking a high wire with Brown and Andy Ashby.</LD>
<LD>   The reality, however, is this:</LD>
<LD>   With pitching critical to their success, with so much invested in
Brown and Ashby, with largely suspect options if either had to be
replaced for a long period, the Dodgers are operating without a net,
the tightrope only as strong as the rebuilt flexor tendon in each of
their elbows.</LD>
<TE>   As the Dodgers nervously waited for a medical update on Brown
Sunday after he was forced to leave Saturday night's start when he
felt pain and burning in that pivotal elbow after delivering a 93-mph
fastball, catcher Paul Lo Duca came closest to conceding what is
obvious.</TE>
<TE>   "For us to win, we need Kevin Brown," Lo Duca said. "He's a leader
on and off the field. I don't know if I'd call it a tightrope, but it
would be a blow if we lost either of those guys for any length of
time. It's really key for us that both of them stay healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca admitted he couldn't be sure of his own health as he
watched Brown leave Saturday's start.</TE>
<TE>   "How did I feel?" he said. "I wanted to throw up."</TE>
<TE>   The update Sunday was reassuring, although not definitive.</TE>
<TE>   Brown had no pain and no overnight swelling, suggesting that "very
little serious [damage] occurred," trainer Stan Johnston said after a
clubhouse examination by Dr. Greg Schwab.</TE>
<TE>   The suspicion remains, Johnston said, that Brown simply tore scar
tissue, but more should be known today when he is examined by Dr.
Frank Jobe after undergoing an MRI test.</TE>
<TE>   Will he miss Thursday's start against the Padres at Dodger
Stadium?</TE>
<TE>   Will he go on the 15-day disabled list, which would seem prudent?</TE>
<TE>   Evans said the Dodgers won't make a decision until he gets Jobe's
report but that he was "very encouraged" by Brown's condition Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   And Brown? Is he optimistic?</TE>
<TE>   "I was optimistic [after Saturday night's game] but some people
didn't believe me," he said, typically taciturn. "Doom and gloom."</TE>
<TE>   He added that he doesn't have a crystal ball but will be ready to
pitch "at the earliest my arm will let me."</TE>
<TE>   Omar Daal would replace Brown if necessary. It isn't clear who
would replace Ashby or another starter if that became necessary and
Brown was sidelined as well.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have no intention of removing Eric Gagne from the
closer role, the triple-A rotation isn't promising, and three other
members of the 2001 rotation in L.A.--James Baldwin, Terry Adams and
Chan Ho Park--work elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The hope, of course, is that it won't come to a worst-case
scenario.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby is scheduled to make his third start Tuesday in Coors Field,
and if that environment isn't enough to create an upset stomach,
watching Brown leave Saturday night, his right arm hanging limply,
did just that, Ashby said.</TE>
<TE>   It was a painful reminder of his own rehabilitation, rekindling
doubts he thought he had put behind him. Asked if it will be easy to
forget what he saw, Ashby shook his head and said:</TE>
<TE>   "You want to say you won't do anything differently, but you're
going to think about it, especially having gone through the same
procedure. In spring training you go through [the recovery] process.
You get to a point where you think, 'OK, you know what, I think I'm
over it.' The main thing is to try to block it out and not think
about it. It's not easy, but I've just got to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Because Ashby had surgery on June 15, 2001 and was back throwing
almost three months ahead of Brown, who had surgery Sept. 27, he
suspects that if he experienced some of the same scar tissue
discomfort that Brown did (or is thought to have), he was able to
work through it during the off-season rather than in a game
situation.</TE>
<TE>   That Brown started later and still caught Ashby in the
season-opening rotation helped convince skeptics that the Dodgers had
moved too fast with Brown and that the $15-million-a-year pitcher had
dictated his timetable.</TE>
<TE>   Evans continued to deny that Sunday, insisting the decisions were
made in concert with Brown and the medical staff, and that "the same
people who say we've been too quick with him forget that he made a
79-pitch gem" last Sunday, giving up four hits in seven shutout
innings against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I always thought he was ready," the catcher said, "and there was
no doubt about it the way he was throwing [Saturday night]. That was
the hardest I've seen him throw in 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe that's why he broke up the adhesions."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, but Schwab, the doctor who examined him in San Diego,
seemed to raise questions about the Dodger timetable when he said of
Brown:</TE>
<TE>   "He had his injury and he had his surgery. When you get to the
point of recovery, it's a blank page. Everybody's different. Maybe
this was a sign he hasn't completed the healing process. He was
definitely wise to stop when he did."</TE>
<TE>   At one point in spring training, pitching coach Jim Colborn and
others speculated that Brown might not be ready for opening day and
the opening week. Brown reacted with a degree of anger, and did, of
course, start the opener--much to Barry Bonds' delight.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any of us felt he was rushed," Colborn said Sunday.
"There are a lot of intelligent, professional people whose opinions
went into the decision and who understand what the club has invested.
I'm confident this is just a bump in the road. I certainly hope so.
He deserves a full year of competition. I don't remember one start,
from spring training on last year, when he didn't have pain. It
started in his foot, went to his neck and settled in his elbow.</TE>
<TE>   "He deserves some fun. Baseball is a game, not a tour of duty at
Attica."</TE>
<TE>   Some might say that fun is an alien concept to Brown. It can
definitely be said that a team whose hopes rest on pitching will
experience an Attica-like lockdown if he is out long.</TE>

<HD>Alomar Finally Gets Offensive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roberto Alomar borrowed one of Mike Piazza's bats and suddenly became
a slugger too.</LD>
<LD>   Alomar homered twice and singled to set up Piazza's go-ahead
single in the sixth inning, leading the New York Mets over the
Montreal Expos, 6-4, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Alomar began the afternoon batting .170 with one home run since
moving to the Mets after 11 years in the American League.</LD>
<TE>   The perennial All-Star hoped to change his luck by trying out a
Piazza bat he sampled in spring training.</TE>
<TE>   "He gave it to me five days ago. Today, I decided to use it, and
it worked," Alomar said. "Using a heavier bat helps me stay back."</TE>
<TE>   Alomar said he planned to use the 33-ounce model tonight against
Atlanta. And that's fine with Piazza.</TE>
<TE>   "He can use them all he wants if he keeps hitting like that," the
All-Star catcher said. "I'll have to order some more for him."</TE>
<TE>   The Mets won for the fourth time in five games. Steve Trachsel
(1-2) got the victory despite another costly error by New York's
shaky infield.</TE>
<TE>   Alomar gave the Mets a quick lead when he hit a three-run homer in
the first inning. In the third, he won a 12-pitch duel with Tony
Armas Jr. (1-2) with a solo shot. Alomar recorded the 13th multihomer
game of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if we'll see a lot of two-homer games from Robbie,
but we'll see a lot of great nights," Met Manager Bobby Valentine
said.</TE>
<TE>   Valentine had offered to give Alomar the day off, but was turned
down.</TE>
<TE>   "I know you're going to have ups and downs," Alomar said. "I
wanted to play."</TE>
<TE>   Florida 7, Atlanta 0--The Marlins (6-6) are at .500 or better
after 12 games for only the third time in their 10-year history. They
started 8-4 in 1997, when they went on to win the World Series, and
6-6 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   They won at Miami behind A.J. Burnett (2-1), who pitched a
four-hitter, and third-string catcher Ramon Castro, who homered
twice.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Marquis (1-2) gave up three home runs, including one by
Derrek Lee that cleared the 434-foot sign in left-center field--and
the 26-foot-high wall behind it. The distance was estimated at 442
feet.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 5, Pittsburgh 1--Jon Lieber waited out more than three
hours of rain delays at Pittsburgh to remain unbeaten against his
former club, limiting the Pirates to a run over five innings.</TE>
<TE>   The game was called with the Pirates about to bat in the eighth
after the third of three rain delays that totaled 3 hours 53 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Lieber (2-0) won for the 19th time in 22 decisions dating to last
season and improved to 7-0 in 10 career starts against the Pirates,
who traded him for outfielder Brant Brown in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 4, San Francisco 3--Barry Bonds left the game in the
second inning at Pacific Bell Park with a hamstring injury and the
Brewers rallied to end their seven-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, who hit his 574th home run Saturday to move past Harmon
Killebrew into sole possession sixth place on the career list, walked
leading off the third inning, advanced on an infield groundout and
scored on Shawon Dunston's single.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds left the game at the end of the inning and the Giants said
he had a mild right hamstring strain, an injury he first sustained
during the final week of spring training.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 6, Colorado 5--Quinton McCracken had three hits and two
RBIs, including his first home run since 1999, helping the
Diamondbacks complete a four-game sweep.</TE>
<TE>   It's the first time the Rockies have been swept in a four-game
series at Coors Field, which opened in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   McCracken, who played for the Rockies from 1995 to 1997, started
his second consecutive game and had a homer, triple and single.
Leading off, he also scored three runs.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 3, Cincinnati 1--Vicente Padilla took a shutout into
the ninth inning at Philadelphia and Bobby Abreu had two RBIs as the
Phillies salvaged the finale of a three-game series.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla (2-1), used primarily as a reliever in the past, gave up
six hits and had 11 strikeouts in his third major league start. He
didn't walk a batter in eight-plus innings.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 5, St. Louis 4--Shane Reynolds (2-1) gave up two runs--one
earned--and six hits in 51/3 innings at St. Louis as the Astros
stopped a five-game Cardinal winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal starter Garrett Stephenson (0-2) yielded two runs and
five hits in three innings, but left because of lower back spasms.</TE>

<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>He was in the echoes. He was in the stares. He was in their heads.</LD>
<LD>   It was one-on-five at Augusta National playground Sunday, a
completely unfair game, because the one was five, and Tiger Woods was
everywhere.</LD>
<LD>   He was in Ernie Els' backswing when, on the 13th hole, the smart
and composed Els tried to hack a ball through a tree trunk.</LD>
<TE>   Triple bogey. Timber!</TE>
<TE>   He was in Vijay Singh's grip when, on the 15th hole, the serene
and steady Singh tried to teach a ball to swim.</TE>
<TE>   Quadruple bogey. Man overboard!</TE>
<TE>   For four hours at the Masters Sunday, Tiger Woods was not only a
golfer, but a specter, his strength and history haunting those around
him until they tugged their hair and tore their clothes and ran
screaming off a cliff.</TE>
<TE>   Woods is so much better than every other golfer on the planet, he
won his third Masters not by being a hero, but simply by being Tiger.</TE>
<TE>   He shot a 71 Sunday, the worst round of any of his three winning
Masters.</TE>
<TE>   He had a total of 276, the worst score he has dared scribble on a
green jacket order form.</TE>
<TE>   None of it mattered.</TE>
<TE>   Not when partner Retief Goosen, who began the round tied with
Woods, left the first tee and hid behind a tree.</TE>
<TE>   Or when Singh got so mad he threw his ball into a creek.</TE>
<TE>   Or when Sergio Garcia threw his ball into the bushes.</TE>
<TE>   Or when Phil Mickelson lost his common sense.</TE>
<TE>   Or when Els lost his cool.</TE>
<TE>   Five of the world's best players surrounded Woods when the round
started.</TE>
<TE>   But, as evidenced by their needless risks and silly dares, it was
the five players who felt surrounded.</TE>
<TE>   Woods simply hung back and watched all five fall on their
keisters, then swooped in with a wink and smile.</TE>
<TE>   Leave it to golf's hippest dude to turn an honorable sport into
short-track speedskating.</TE>
<TE>   "I honestly don't think that anyone can really appreciate, except
for the players, how difficult this golf course was playing today,"
Woods said.</TE>
<TE>   Nudge, nudge.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, if your name wasn't Tiger Woods, it was almost
impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Try blocking out the echoes of wild cheers for Woods as they
drifted through the late afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to play with Tiger, because he doesn't give you any
room to maneuver," Jose Maria Olazabal said.</TE>
<TE>   Try ignoring the pleading looks of fans who constantly remind you,
if you don't do something dramatic, you don't stand a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about Tiger is that he's the only leader that you don't
have the hope he'll falter," Mickelson said. "When other guys are up
there, you know that if you can just stay around there, there's a
good chance they might come back two or three shots.</TE>
<TE>   "But Tiger doesn't ever seem to do that."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, try beating the Yankees in Game 7 at Yankee
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Augusta is the perfect match for Woods' big hitting and brainy
shot-making.</TE>
<TE>   Especially if he gets last at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   Is it any wonder, then, that his caddie Steve Williams shouted
this specific request at Tiger's sailing ball on his final approach
shot of the third round Saturday afternoon:</TE>
<TE>   "Get into the last group!"</TE>
<TE>   Woods, of course, birdied that hole and moved into a final group
that he likens to a pole position.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody thinks they can outrun him from there--he won all six
previous majors in which he led or shared the lead after three
rounds.</TE>
<TE>   But everyone is willing to smash into a wall trying.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, this tournament was actually won Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "If you think you can't make any mistakes," said Thomas Bjorn
after his final-round 77, "then you are going to make mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Woods already averaged a four-stroke advantage over his playing
partners in the final round of his previous winning majors, so it's
no surprise that Goosen laid a 74, three strokes worse than the
champ.</TE>
<TE>   But who would have thought that former Masters champion Singh
would hum a 76, featuring two splashdowns on the 15th hole?</TE>
<TE>   "That was the end of that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Who would have guessed that-- Els Bells!--Ernie would hit a 73
with his triple bogey?</TE>
<TE>   "I told myself not to hit to the left," he said of the 13th jinx.
"I guess I just didn't listen to myself."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia shot a 75 and, with wide eyes, said, "It just happened."</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson made two quick birdies, played the rest of the course in
one over par, then sighed.</TE>
<TE>   "You know that you have to go after him to make birdies to catch
him," he said, "which is why I think we saw guys taking aggressive
plays and making bogeys and doubles because of it."</TE>
<TE>   Like he said. A haunting.</TE>
<TE>   The only time any of the leaders hung with Woods was at the 18th
green, when Goosen made a rookie-type mistake by not staying back and
allowing Woods to walk alone into the circle of cheers.</TE>
<TE>   But that's OK. He'll learn. Tiger Woods will show him. Just as he
shows all of them. Simply by showing up. Right?</TE>
<TE>   "We've been over this a million times," said an irritated Bjorn,
spinning on his spikes and stalking away into the Augusta evening, a
red shirt on his mind, a strange breeze on his shoulder.</TE>

<HD>Chang Makes Quick Work of Mamiit</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The end is near. But it's not here.</LD>
<LD>   Top-seeded Michael Chang defeated No. 5-seeded Cecil Mamiit, 6-3,
7-5, in 89 minutes Sunday in the championship match of the U.S.
Tennis Assn. Challenger of Calabasas at Calabasas Tennis and Swim
Club for his first tournament title since winning the Los Angeles
Open in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   "It feels great," Chang said. "Coming into this week, I was hoping
to win a match."</LD>
<TE>   Since advancing to the quarterfinals of a Challenger event at
Hawaii in January, Chang, 30, had lost in the first round of six
consecutive tournaments, including last week at Tarzana, where he
also was seeded No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, he finally felt like a top-seeded player, even if it
happened in a lower-level match than he has been used to playing for
most of his career, and on a tour he has been forced to join on a
regular basis to gain ranking points and boost his sagging
confidence, admittedly hurt by two years of struggle on the court.</TE>
<TE>   His last victory in an ATP Tour match came at Vienna in October.</TE>
<TE>   "I think most people would see this as just a Challenger, but I
see it as much more than that, especially because it has been so
long," Chang said. "The longer you play, every victory that you get
becomes that much sweeter."</TE>
<TE>   The victory over Mamiit finally gave the 1989 French Open champion
more titles in challengers (two) than in grand slams (one) because he
rarely had to play at the developmental levels after bursting on the
scene as a teenager. It probably will give Chang, No. 92 in the world
in the ATP entry-system rankings, a standing high enough to ensure
direct entry into this year's French Open on May 28-June 10.</TE>
<TE>   Although his career is winding down, the French Open will not be
his swan song. Chang said he plans to play for at least another two
years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if you asked me that a week ago, I might have had a very
different answer," he said. "Obviously, that's not set in stone. It's
been a really tough road for me. But it's not a pride thing for me.
I'm just out here trying to help my game and help my confidence. If I
get to the point where I don't want to be out there and working as
hard as I can, then I'll know it's time."</TE>
<TE>   In the doubles final, Paul Rosner of South Africa and Glenn Weiner
outlasted Paul Goldstein and former UCLA player Justin Gimelstob,
6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (4).</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Gentry Disagrees That Team Has Packed It In</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With 11 losses in their last 15 games, the Clippers would seem to
have packed it in for 2001-02, content to have improved by seven
victories over last season.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Alvin Gentry hopes that's not the case, however.</LD>
<LD>   "We still have a lot to play for," he said. "We've told the
players it's no different from working at IBM or Xerox or whatever.
If you work for 10 months, you don't all of a sudden stop the last
two months of the year."</LD>
<TE>   Gentry attributes the lackluster stretch of games to facing
difficult opposition in the last few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Clippers haven't lost to a team below them in the
Western Conference standings since a defeat March 23 against the
Phoenix Suns. Moreover, the Clippers have played only two teams in
their last 10 games that won't advance to the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Their final games are Tuesday against the Memphis Grizzlies and
Wednesday against the Golden State Warriors--two teams that will join
the Clippers in watching the postseason on TV.</TE>
<TE>   Two victories would give the Clippers a 40-42 record, only the
third time in the franchise's L.A. history it has won 40 or more
games. Gentry is also fond of pointing out that the Clippers would be
the first team since the Houston Rockets of the early 1980s to go
from 15 victories to 40 or more in two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think we could end up on a positive note and have a
really successful season," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Darius Miles echoed his coach's comments.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to try to finish the season strong and win the next
two games," he said. "I knew it was going to take time. We didn't
come out [this season] to win a championship. We'll take it step by
step. We're a couple of games out of the playoffs this year and,
hopefully, we can make the playoffs next season."</TE>
<TE>   Added guard Earl Boykins: "We still have to go out and play. We're
going to go out there and try to finish the season with a couple of
wins."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers hold their final practice today and Gentry has no
plans to scrap his lesson plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We're approaching it like it's still the middle of the season,"
he said. "We're not going to take any shortcuts."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanford, the No. 2-ranked team in the nation, used the long ball to
batter USC pitching all weekend in knocking the Trojans out of the
Pacific 10 Conference lead.</LD>
<LD>   The Cardinal took two of three games at Stanford's Sunken Diamond
by blowing out USC, 15-4, Sunday behind three-run home runs by Arik
VanZandt, Brian Hall and Jason Cooper. All three hit homers in USC's
16-11 victory Saturday and Stanford had 11 home runs in the three
games.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, the Trojans (20-16, 6-3 in Pac-10 play) were held in
check by starter John Hudgins (6-0) after banging out 16 hits
Saturday, led by David Gordon's four hits and four runs batted in and
Joey Metropolous' three-run homer.</LD>
<TE>   Hudgins gave up four runs and nine hits in seven innings,
including home runs by Brian Barre and Alberto Concepcion.</TE>
<TE>   USC fell half a game behind Arizona State, and Stanford (25-8,
4-2) pulled within one game of the Sun Devils.</TE>
<TE>   "It's huge for us to win two out of three games against USC,"
Cooper said. "We expect them to be right near the top of the Pac-10
standings when the season is over."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State (24-13, 8-4) took over first place with a 15-2
victory over UCLA at Jackie Robinson Stadium. The Bruins lost two of
three and fell to 15-22, 2-4.</TE>
<TE>   In the Big West, first-place Long Beach State (23-10, 8-1) kept
its one-game lead with a 4-2 victory over UC Santa Barbara at Blair
Field. Jered Weaver (5-2) scattered eight hits in five innings and
Nate Beucler threw four shutout innings of relief for his first save.</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Chris Wright went three for three and nine for 11 for
the series. Wright said Sunday's victory was key after the 49ers
committed three errors Saturday and gave up seven runs in the 10th
inning of a 13-6 loss.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach, ranked 14th by Baseball America, has won eight of 10
three-game series this season.</TE>
<TE>   "The key thing [Sunday] was we didn't let our emotions get in the
way," Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Fullerton (23-12, 7-2) took two of three at Pacific by
winning, 11-4. The No. 13 Titans won, 5-4, Friday before losing, 8-7,
Saturday. Cal State Northridge (25-13, 6-3) dropped two games behind
Long Beach by losing 8-2 to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo after splitting
the first two games of the series. Kevin Correia (7-2) pitched a
seven-hitter in outdueling Northridge ace Bill Murphy (7-2).</TE>
<TE>   UC Riverside (22-16, 3-6) completed a three-game sweep of Cal
State Sacramento by winning 17-5 on Sunday. In winning their first
Big West games, the Highlanders outscored the Hornets, 34-8, in the
three games.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Silva sparked a three-run eighth-inning rally with a home run
as Loyola Marymount (16-21, 9-5) defeated Pepperdine, 8-5, to take
two of three from the Waves. Pepperdine (19-20, 8-5) had its lead in
the West Coast Conference's Coast Division sliced to half a game over
St. Mary's.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Natasha Watley's single drove in Casey Hiraiwa with two out in the
bottom of the 10th inning to give No. 2 UCLA a 1-0 victory over No. 8
California in a Pac-10 softball game at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA won two in a row against Cal after defeating No. 3 Stanford
on Friday. Amanda Freed shut out the Golden Bears on four hits as the
Bruins improved to 37-6, 5-3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A bench-clearing baseball brawl between Maryland and Georgia Tech
prompted umpires to suspend Sunday's game at College Park, Md.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Tech led, 12-0, in the seventh inning when Jeff Watchko
threw a pitch behind Jason Maxey. Moments later, Maxey hit a home run
and exchanged words with Watchko as he rounded the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Watchko was ejected, and as Maxey's teammates gathered at the
plate to congratulate him, catcher Tyler Parker got into an argument
with Maryland players. Georgia Tech players then rushed onto the
field.</TE>
<TE>   The umpires conferred for about an hour before deciding to suspend
the game because of Georgia Tech's travel arrangements. The Atlantic
Coast Conference is expected to decide the game's outcome today.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>So Far, All Signs Are Encouraging for Brown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Kevin Brown experienced mild stiffness but no pain Sunday in his
surgically repaired elbow, which the Dodger right-hander reinjured in
the second inning against the Padres on Saturday night. There was
also no increase in swelling overnight, leading the Dodgers to
believe Brown's latest setback is minor.</LD>
<LD>   Brown could miss his next scheduled start Thursday, and there's a
chance he could go on the disabled list, but after being examined
again Sunday by Dr. Greg Schwab, a San Diego physician, there appears
to be no structural damage to the ligaments or muscles in Brown's
elbow.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a little difficult to interpret after surgery, but there's
nothing that looked real ugly, nothing that looked terrible," Schwab
said. "I've been surprised before, but I don't think so [in this
case]."</LD>
<TE>   Brown, who underwent surgery to repair a torn flexor muscle last
Sept. 27, will be examined today in Los Angeles by Dodger physicians
Frank Jobe and Ralph Gambardella. He will also undergo an MRI test.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks good so far, but we'll take it one day at a time,"
General Manager Dan Evans said. "It's encouraging when he doesn't
have pain, and everything we believed [Saturday] night looks to be
the same [Sunday]."</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Stan Johnston said the burning sensation Brown felt in his
elbow while delivering a 2-and-2 fastball to Tom Lampkin in the
second inning Saturday night is consistent with the breakup or
release of scar tissue.</TE>
<TE>   If Brown misses his next start, he will be replaced in the
rotation by left-hander Omar Daal. If he goes on the disabled list,
Daal would remain in the rotation and the Dodgers would recall a
reliever--probably Ricky Bones, Guillermo Mota or Kevin Beirne--to
take Daal's bullpen spot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paul Quantrill has lost that sinking feeling on a few too many
pitches, and as a result, the Dodger reliever has not been nearly as
effective as he knows he can be.</TE>
<TE>   Quantrill has given up seven earned runs and 11 hits in 31/3
innings of his last four games, sending his earned-run average to
9.45. A sinkerball and control specialist acquired in a winter trade,
Quantrill went 11-2 with a 3.04 ERA in 80 games for Toronto last
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not locked in by any stretch of the imagination," Quantrill
said. "I'm a little out of whack and fighting myself. When I'm on, I
minimize mistakes, and my pitches are fairly consistent with good
sink. Right now, I'll throw several good ones and then one that
flattens out."</TE>
<TE>   Quantrill has hit some tough luck. Wednesday night in San
Francisco, in the ninth inning of a 1-1 game, Quantrill pitched Giant
slugger Barry Bonds about as tough as he can be pitched. But Bonds
sliced a full-count inside pitch for an opposite-field fly ball that
landed just inside the left-field line for a game-winning RBI double.</TE>
<TE>   "That was probably the best sequence of pitches we threw to Bonds
in the six games we played him," Manager Jim Tracy said. "That was
the worst he looked in any at-bat against us."</TE>

<HD>Dodger Bats Decide to Take the Day Off</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Offense fails to push across a run despite
numerous scoring opportunities in 1-0 loss to Padres.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers' nine-game road trip through San Francisco, San Diego and
Colorado hits Coors Field tonight, and not a moment too soon.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodger offense fizzled again in a 1-0 loss to the Padres
before 46,410 in Qualcomm Stadium on Sunday night, failing to score
after loading the bases with no out in the fifth inning. In their six
losses, the Dodgers have scored a grand total of seven runs.</LD>
<LD>   But if ever there's a place to add a little fuel-injection to your
offense, it's Denver's Coors Field, where the Dodgers averaged 7.7
runs in nine games against the Rockies last season, including a 22-7
victory on July 21.</LD>
<TE>   "You've still got to hit the ball, though," said second baseman
Jeff Reboulet, who epitomized the Dodgers' frustration by stranding
six baserunners in his first start of the season Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   "The balls I hit tonight weren't going anywhere. They were four
feet in front of the plate. Unless the ground is a lot harder in
Coors Field, those aren't going to be hits up the middle anyway."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers got another superb effort from their starting pitcher,
as Hideo Nomo gave up one run and four hits in 62/3 innings, but
that's nothing new. In the last nine games, in which the Dodgers are
6-3, their starters have given up only four earned runs in 521/3
innings for an earned-run average of 0.69.</TE>
<TE>   "We should be 8-1 or 9-0 in those games, but we haven't produced,"
catcher Paul Lo Duca said. "Hideo didn't lose this game; we did. Our
pitching the last nine games has been phenomenal.</TE>
<TE>   "What's really frustrating is our pitching has carried us, and we
haven't clicked as an offense. We haven't gotten hits when we need
them. Coors Field may be a hitter's haven, but we need to do a better
job of executing with guys on base. Everyone."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego right-hander Brian Lawrence, who extended his scoreless
streak to 16 innings with seven four-hit shutout innings, had a
no-hitter through four before giving up singles to Shawn Green and
Brian Jordan to start the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan beat Lawrence's throw to second on Eric Karros' dribbler
back to the mound, loading the bases with no out. Adrian Beltre hit a
grounder to third baseman Sean Burroughs, who threw to home to force
Green. Reboulet tapped to Lawrence, who threw home to force Jordan.
Nomo grounded to short, ending the inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers also put two on with two out in the seventh and eighth
innings, but Padre shortstop Deivi Cruz ranged far to his left for a
nice play on Reboulet's grounder to end the seventh, and Green popped
to shallow left to end the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys' batting averages are going up, but it's not helping us
score runs," Jordan said. "We're not getting the hits when we need
them. We blew a lot of opportunities. No way can you expect to win
when you don't score after loading the bases with no outs."</TE>
<TE>   Reboulet, a reserve infielder who had only four at-bats prior to
Sunday night's game, took the loss hard.</TE>
<TE>   "We had about 400 guys on base," Reboulet said. "It was my
[season] debut, and I was pretty much the culprit as far as leaving
guys on. You've really got to get them in when you have the chance."</TE>
<TE>   Reboulet was far from the only culprit. The top three batters in
the order, Dave Roberts, Cesar Izturis and Lo Duca (pinch-hit for by
Dave Hansen in the eighth), combined to go 0 for 10. Roberts should
be of particular concern; the leadoff batter is now hitting .206 with
a .270 on-base percentage.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who went 0 for six with runners in scoring position,
hit only eight balls to the outfield. They managed five hits, the
fourth time this season they've been limited to five or fewer. Not
surprisingly, of their 12 games this season, six have ended in
shutouts, with the Dodgers going 3-3 in those games. They're 6-6
overall.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres scored in the seventh, an inning that began with Cruz's
bloop single and Lawrence's sacrifice. Pinch-hitter Mark Sweeney
lined to left, and Dodger Manager Jim Tracy stuck with Nomo instead
of going to left-handed reliever Jesse Orosco against switch-hitter
D'Angelo Jimenez.</TE>
<TE>   On Nomo's 114th and final pitch, an 0-and-2 fastball on a night
his forkball was working so well, Jimenez lined an RBI single to
center.</TE>
<TE>   "I chose to throw a fastball in that situation," Nomo said through
an interpreter, "and unfortunately he hit it."</TE>
<TE>   Which is a lot more than the Dodgers did Sunday night.</TE>

<LD>KINGS VS. AVALANCHE</LD>
<LD>   OFFENSE: While the search for balance continues, Jason Allison,
Ziggy Palffy and Adam Deadmarsh have been the Kings' only consistent
scoring threats. Joe Sakic is the leader of an Avalanche attack that
has sputtered at times. The wild cards are Peter Forsberg, who has
sat out all season but could return for this series, and Milan
Hejduk, recovering from abdominal surgery.</LD>
<LD>   DEFENSE: A versatile, high-scoring corps of mobile defensemen led
by Olympians Mattias Norstrom and Aaron Miller and all-star Jaroslav
Modry is the Kings' greatest strength. For the Avalanche, Rob Blake,
Adam Foote and Darius Kasparaitis rank among the league's best
defensemen and helped Colorado lead the league in goals-against
average.</LD>
<TE>   GOALTENDING: As Felix Potvin goes, so go the Kings. Colorado's
Patrick Roy led the league with a career-best goals-against average
of 1.94 and was second with a .925 save percentage. Against the
Kings, however, the game's preeminent goaltender was 2-2 with a 3.26
goals-against average and .859 save percentage.</TE>
<TE>   COACHING: Andy Murray deserves credit for keeping the Kings
focused when they were on the verge of falling out of playoff
contention in early December. Bob Hartley guided the Avalanche
through the final two rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs last season
and to their eighth consecutive division title this season without
Forsberg.</TE>
<TE>   KING LINES</TE>
<TE>   RONNING-ALLISON-DEADMARSH: Allison, Deadmarsh club's top two
scorers.</TE>
<TE>   BEDNAR-SMOLINSKI-PALFFY: Palffy always dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   ELORANTA-CHARTRAND-LAPERRIERE: Consistent checking line.</TE>
<TE>   JOHNSON-E. BELANGER-BUCHBERGER: Blend of speed, veteran
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   AVALANCHE LINES</TE>
<TE>   TANGUAY-SAKIC-VRBATA: Sakic was NHL's 2000-01 MVP.</TE>
<TE>   DRURY-REINPRECHT-HINOTE: Solid second line.</TE>
<TE>   MESSIER-YELLE-KEENE: Will try to contain Allison line.</TE>
<TE>   PODEIN-NEDORAST-PARKER: Forsberg return will scramble lines.</TE>
<TE>   FINAL ANALYSIS: Roy makes the Avalanche the better team, but his
struggles against the Kings this season give Murray &amp; Co. hope. The
Kings nearly derailed the Avalanche's championship run last spring
before losing in Game 7 of the Western Conference semifinals.</TE>

<LD>In terms of quality, the Kentucky Oaks, which will be run May 3, is
looking like it will be a better race than the Kentucky Derby, which
follows the next day at Churchill Downs.</LD>
<LD>   Besides Take Charge Lady, who has been very impressive in three
victories in 2002 in Louisiana and Kentucky, the Oaks will include
You, Habibti and Bella Bellucci.</LD>
<LD>   Trained by Neil Drysdale for owner Michael Tabor, Bella Bellucci
looks to be approaching the Oaks the right way, given how easily she
captured the $108,200 Comely Sunday at Aqueduct.</LD>
<TE>   Ridden with confidence by Gary Stevens, the 3-year-old daughter of
French Deputy dominated at 3-5, beating pacesetter and 16-1 shot
Short None by seven lengths.</TE>
<TE>   Now a winner four times in five starts, the 2-year-old purchased
for $925,000 completed the mile in 1:352/5.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a nice prep," said Drysdale, whose filly had won her 2002
debut on March 24 at Santa Anita, rallying from last in the Santa
Paula. "I was very pleased. It was just what the doctor ordered.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted her to have two comfortable races before the Kentucky
Oaks. I have no distance concerns with her [the Oaks is 11/8 miles].
Her full brother, Kurofune, won going long in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "She galloped out very well today and I don't think she will have
a problem with two turns. The 3-year-old filly division is very
strong this year. Take Charge Lady has been very impressive."</TE>
<TE>   Along with stablemate Sunday Break, who will point for the Derby
after finishing a perfect-trip third in the Wood Memorial on
Saturday, Bella Bellucci will go to Churchill Downs on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mountain Rage became the fourth horse to win three stakes at the
Santa Anita meet when he rolled to a three-length victory Sunday in
the $82,050 La Puente.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Bob Baffert for a partnership, the 3-year-old son of
Mecke and 9-5 favorite had one beat after a half-mile, but rallied
strongly to win in 1:344/5 for the mile on turf.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Victor Espinoza, Mountain Rage--who had won the Hill
Rise and Academy Road earlier in the season-- joined Came Home, Snow
Ridge and Megahertz as triple stakes winners at Santa Anita, which
concludes its 85-day meet Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Doc Holiday, the pacesetter and 7-1 fourth choice in the field of
eight, held second, a length in front of Stormy Forever, then came
9-5 second choice Johar, Don't Holler, Night Passion, Dark Sorcerer
and Red Briar.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Wayne Lukas won three races at Keeneland, including the
$272,000 Commonwealth Breeders' Cup with 5-2 second choice Orientate.</TE>
<TE>   Over a track labeled muddy, Orientate, led throughout in winning
for the fifth time in 12 starts, beating 9-5 favorite Aldebaran by
11/4 lengths in 1:212/5 for the seven furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   "He was on cruise control most of the way," said winning rider Pat
Day. "He's like a little quarter horse leaving the gate. We heard
[Aldebaran] coming down the lane, but there was plenty left in the
tank."</TE>
<TE>   Besides Orientate, Lukas also won the fifth with Summer Heat, a
debuting Capote filly, and the seventh with 6-1 shot Unbridled Time.</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>King goalie Jamie Storr made it a fine family outing Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Storr had played only 37 minutes 34 seconds in relief since
surviving a 5-4 victory over Pittsburgh on Feb. 27. But he stepped up
and made 23 saves in a 1-0 victory over the Ducks Sunday at Staples
Center.</LD>
<LD>   "I was really excited because it was my son's first game," Storr
said.</LD>
<TE>   Tyson Storr was born last month and Storr's wife, Niki, brought
him to a hockey game for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "He can't recognize anything yet, but just the fact he was here
was important," Storr said. "When he gets older, I will be able to
show him the game puck. He'll be able to hear all about this game."</TE>
<TE>   There will be a lot to tell. Storr has played in only 19 games
this season, as Felix Potvin set a King record by playing in 72
games. But he saved one of his best performances for Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks didn't overwork him, but Storr did turn away several
quality scoring opportunities for his second shutout of the season.
He also blanked the New York Rangers on Jan. 9.</TE>
<TE>   "They only got 23 shots because the guys played awesome in front
of me," Storr said. "Whenever I had to make a save, I had guys there
clearing the rebounds."</TE>
<TE>   Both Mathieu Schneider and Jaroslav Modry were too sick to play,
leaving the Kings with only five defensemen.</TE>
<TE>   "We told Schneider last night to stay home," King Coach Andy
Murray said. "Then I got the call about Modry this morning. I called
Schneider and said, 'You feeling any better?' He tried, but it was
better that we sent him home."</TE>
<TE>   That provided extra time for Andreas Lilja, who had sat out the
last seven games. Lilja played 32 shifts and 22:53.</TE>
<TE>   "Boy, our defensemen played as well today as they have played all
year," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   Storr picked up a penalty for roughing in the first period. Lilja
and Duck enforcer Kevin Sawyer crashed into Storr and, with a pileup
by the net, Storr landed a few punches to Sawyer's head.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a mistake," Storr said. "Someone hit me and I found out
later it was Andreas."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were scoreless on five power-play tries. They closed out
the season with only four goals in their last 65 power plays.</TE>
<TE>   "That is absolutely the story of the year [for us]," Duck Coach
Bryan Murray said. "We played hard, we played determined, we didn't
give up many scoring chances, we didn't give up many shots and we
don't score any goals. It's decided on the power play.</TE>
<TE>   "We had power-play chances and didn't finish. How many times did I
say that this year?"</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' Paul Kariya finished with 32 goals, one less than last
season. He nearly got No. 33 in the second period, but ringed a slap
shot off the crossbar.</TE>

<HD>Maybe Pippen Had His Phil</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Now the Portland Trail Blazers have to wonder about Scottie Pippen
against Phil Jackson, Pippen against the Lakers, Pippen against
Pippen, in the playoffs, assuming that's the matchup.</LD>
<LD>   He missed 16 of 18 shots in a 12-point loss to the Lakers 21/2
weeks ago, when he kept shooting and the Trail Blazers kept falling
farther behind.</LD>
<LD>   On national television Sunday afternoon, as the Trail Blazers
desperately sought to unnerve the Lakers here, he threw a basketball
20 rows into the crowd with more than 36 minutes left in a close game
the Trail Blazers eventually won in two overtimes, 128-120.</LD>
<TE>   That brought only the first technical. Then Pippen snapped at
referee Bennett Salvatore, and Salvatore ejected him with the second
technical, which brought a hail of miniature Bill Waltons.</TE>
<TE>   Pippen apparently mistakenly thought a Salvatore whistle with 2:20
left in the second quarter was a foul instead of a defensive
three-second call.</TE>
<TE>   Pippen chose poorly. He scored 14 points in 20 first-half minutes
and had five assists, every bit the offensive conductor Jackson had
talked about before the game.</TE>
<TE>   Several times in the first quarter, Pippen stood at the free-throw
lane facing his former coach. The two made eye contact. They grinned
and nodded, two old friends who'd been through all of it hundreds of
times, most of it together.</TE>
<TE>   It is Jackson, however, whose championship run has continued on
the backs of the game's greatest players.</TE>
<TE>   It is Pippen who carries the greater load, the underachieving
franchise that will enter the playoffs as the likely sixth seed, two
years after standing a quarter from the NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   When the tiny redheads were thrown, Jackson picked up one, holding
it aloft.</TE>
<TE>   When the referees cleared the floor of players and sent ball boys
to gather up the drinks and dolls and trays, Jackson extricated the
miniature Hall of Famer from its plastic container and passed it to
Tex Winter, sitting just off his left shoulder.</TE>

<LD>   Khannouchi, born in Morocco and a U.S. citizen, surpassed by four
seconds his previous mark, set three years ago in Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   Paula Radcliffe of Britain, in her first race at the distance, won
the women's division in 2:18:56, the second-best time in history.</LD>
<TE>   Radcliffe's time was nine seconds slower than the world mark set

<HD>Gentilozzi Shows He's Game on Last-Lap Jam</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For anyone enjoying late-race theatrics, it was hard to top the
Johnson Controls 100 in the Trans-Am Series for the BF Goodrich Tires
Cup.</LD>
<LD>   Three drivers led the last lap, the leader going into the last lap
made contact with other drivers at least four times in the final
minutes, and Paul Gentilozzi went from third to first with only three
turns remaining to score the 24th victory of his career.</LD>
<LD>   The timed race was scheduled for 51 laps or 70 minutes, and it
went 45 laps. The wild finish began with Boris Said taking the white
flag and second-place Gentilozzi and Justin Bell trailing. Said went
into Turn 1 too hot, and Gentilozzi closed the deficit--bumping the
back of Said's Panoz Esperante.</LD>
<TE>   They continued to battle to the back straightaway on the 1.97-mile
layout on the Long Beach streets, their cars touching as Said tried
to block the three-time champion.</TE>
<TE>   As they tangled and Gentilozzi backed off, Bell--who won last
year's season finale--made a desperate move past Said, "but I think
he forgot to brake," Gentilozzi said. Bell appeared to take the lead
ever so briefly before making contact with Said, and in Turn 8, he
spun nearly 180 degrees as Gentilozzi moved into first on the 11-turn
course.</TE>
<TE>   "That last straightaway was World Wrestling at its best," Said
said. "[Bell] threw a Hail Mary on fourth and long."</TE>
<TE>   Gentilozzi, the pole-sitter in a Jaguar XKR, took on new tires
during his pit stop and won Long Beach for the fourth time. Said, who
started second and did not take tires, was second and Johnny Miller,
also in a Jaguar, was third. Bell, who started 15th in a Corvette,
finished eighth.</TE>
<TE>   The climactic end was set up by a caution flag with nine laps to
go, wiping out about a seven-second lead that Said had built by
pitting early and then passing last year's race winner, Lou
Gigliotti, as the leaders pitted on Lap 24.</TE>
<TE>   "I hated to see that last yellow come out because we had this race
won easily," Said said. "No way they were going to catch me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Canada's Michael Valiante made a daring pass of Alex Gurney on Lap
20 and scored his first victory in the series, giving Lynx Racing its
second consecutive victory at Long Beach in the Toyota Atlantic
Chevron Challenge.</TE>
<TE>   The timed race was shortened from 32 to 29 laps because it was
slowed by 14 laps under caution. A first-turn accident on the first
lap brought 24 of the 27 cars to a standstill. Gurney, Valiante and
the man who caused the pileup, third-place finisher Jon Fogarty, were
the only drivers to get through the first turn.</TE>
<TE>   Fogarty made an aggressive attempt at the lead from the inside of
the second row, but locked his wheels and slid past the apex of the
turn, sending pole-sitter Joey Hand and No. 2 qualifier Ryan
Hunter-Reay into a tire wall.</TE>
<TE>   Several cars made contact in the bottleneck.</TE>
<TE>   The first six laps, and 14 of the first 19, were run under yellow
all because of three crashes in Turn 1. On the restart on Lap 20 with
Gurney protecting the inside, Valiante made a gutsy pass on the
outside going into the first turn.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that was probably going to be my last chance," Valiante
said. "I couldn't come off the hairpin [at the front of the
straightaway] as good as him, but I was running a little less
downforce. I don't think I would have passed him if I didn't pass him
right then."</TE>
<TE>   Valiante wobbled through the turn, coming within inches of the
wall, and was never challenged, winning by 2.812 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "I pulled up a little because I thought he wasn't going to make
it," said Gurney, who lives in nearby Newport Beach. "When he made
it, I said, 'You lucky dog.'"</TE>
<TE>   In seven Atlantic races, Valiante has never finished lower than
sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Fogarty retained the series lead with 35 points, three more than
Valiante. Rocky Moran Jr., who finished fifth, has 21 points,
followed by Luis Diaz with 19 and Gurney with 17.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter-Reay, who finished 18th, broke the Atlantic course record
with a lap of 1 minute 18.456 seconds, and was more than a second
faster than anyone else in the field.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like the entire Atlantic field got lucky today because I
had the best car I have ever driven," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was particularly heartbreaking to Dorricott Racing's Gurney,
who started fourth, because his father, Dan Gurney--who celebrated
his 71st birthday on Saturday--played such an integral role in
creating the Grand Prix.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been great to win," he said, "but they had the
strongest car."</TE>

<HD>Peace With Honor for Mickelson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL PLASCHKE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a week of tension, Phil Mickelson ended another tumultuous
Masters at peace.</LD>
<LD>   This wasn't only because of his one-under-par 71 Sunday, equaling
the best final-round score of the five top leaders.</LD>
<LD>   This also wasn't only because he moved up to third place, equaling
his highest finish here, further convincing him that he is on the
verge of finally winning a major tournament.</LD>
<TE>   His peace was about, surprisingly enough, a movie.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson said he saw the critically acclaimed film "The Rookie"
this week, and that one line uttered by actor Dennis Quaid--playing
the role of former pitcher Jim Morris--changed his approach.</TE>
<TE>   "He said one line that hit home with me about how he was very
excited about how today he's very lucky to be able to play baseball,"
Mickelson said. "And today I thought I was very lucky to be able to
play the final round of the Masters here at Augusta, play the back
nine and be on the leaderboard and play this game for a living and be
very fortunate."</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson also thanked those members of the media who have
attempted to defuse the growing tension between the two parties.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a very awkward past 12 or 15 months in that I've not
had the most popular or positive stuff written about me," he said.
"But this week, a lot of you came up to me, my wife, Amy, and my
family members and showed a lot of encouragement and I appreciate
those kind words."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tom Watson celebrated the 25th anniversary of his first Masters
victory by leading the tournament with eight three-putts and
finishing tied for 40th among 45 players who made the cut. His score
was 295.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he gave his conservative seal of approval to the lengthening
of the course.</TE>
<TE>   "I think No. 18 is too long up the hill, but No. 9 is OK," he
said, referring to two of the five holes that were changed. "I like
the changes. They are good for the golf course. I have no
complaints."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe this means he won't get one of those letters of dismissal
now given aging golfers by Masters Chairman Hootie Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   The letters have become so infamous, even Tiger Woods jokingly
addressed next year's record-attempting defense of his consecutive
titles by saying, "If I don't get a letter, I'm coming back."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest ovations on the final day was for John Daly,
who was cheered mostly just for finishing.</TE>
<TE>   He shot a 75 and finished tied for 32nd, but at least he didn't
walk off the course in the middle of a round, or double-hit a putt in
frustration, or break any other rule or ethical code.</TE>
<TE>   A changed man, finally? He says yes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievable, they haven't given up on me," he said of the
fans. "Now there are important things at home [his fourth wife]. As
long as I set daily goals, it keeps me going. The difference in my
game is that I try harder every time I go out."</TE>
<TE>   Although Woods averaged 293.8 yards per drive, he was still beaten
in that category by Daly, who led everyone with 297.8.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The best round of the final day was played by Shigeki Maruyama,
who shot five-under 67 to move into the top 15 at 287, his highest
Masters finish in five tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   Maruyama, who lives part-time in Beverly Hills, was perhaps the
only player who didn't seem intimidated by the presence of Woods. Of
course, teeing off three hours before Woods helps.</TE>
<TE>   "I was attacking it today, it was great," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The head-in-the-sand-trap award goes to, as usual, CBS Sports,
which repeatedly showed Sam Snead's ceremonial first drive, complete
with tinkling piano music and tradition-filled waxing.</TE>
<TE>   They made absolutely no mention that Snead's drive hooked into the
crowd, careening off the face of a spectator, cutting his nose and
breaking his glasses.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With his final-round 71, Woods set the Masters record for most
consecutive subpar rounds--10.... Retief Goosen's 74 Sunday ensured
that, in its 66 years, the Masters still has not had a player shoot
four rounds in the 60s.</TE>

<HD>Lead Is the Safest Place for Labonte in Virginia 500</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MARTINSVILLE, Va.</DL>
<LD>Bobby Labonte isn't one for the bumping and banging that characterize
short-track racing. So when the Pontiac driver found himself in prime
position Sunday, he only had to drive.</LD>
<LD>   On a day when Kevin Harvick wasn't allowed to race, the Virginia
500 NASCAR Winston Cup race still featured plenty of banging, and one
near gift from Tony Stewart that Labonte turned into his 19th
victory.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm never going to push anybody out of the way like I've seen
other guys do, so I figured if I was up front I probably had a better
shot than being behind somebody," Labonte said of his first
short-track victory.</LD>
<TE>   Harvick's growing status as NASCAR's bad boy was solidified hours
before the race, when the governing body made him the first driver
barred from an event because of rough driving in the series' 54-year
history.</TE>
<TE>   Harvick's penalty came after he clashed several times with Coy
Gibbs during the Advance Auto Parts 250 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series
race on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   In all, there were 14 caution flags that slowed the pace for 104
laps, many caused by the nose-to-tail and side-by-side contact that
typify short-track racing.</TE>
<TE>   The race even ended under a final-lap caution after a crash,
allowing Labonte to cruise home.</TE>
<TE>   In all likelihood, he had Stewart to thank. Stewart, who finished
third, led until Stacy Compton and Johnny Benson got together, Benson
spinning into the wall to bring out the 11th yellow flag.</TE>
<TE>   Only 55 laps remained, but Stewart and Bobby Hamilton, running
fourth, pitted to take on two new tires, giving Labonte the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "If he'd have stayed out, he probably would have won," Labonte
said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Labonte won with an average speed of 73.951 mph, becoming
the 10th different driver to win in the last 10 Virginia 500s.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Kenseth, who started 26th, finished second.</TE>
<TE>   Pole-sitter and four-time series champion Jeff Gordon finished
23rd, a non-winner for the 16th consecutive race.</TE>

<HD>Allen Does His Share for the Bucks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the midst of the most trying season of his NBA career, Ray Allen
had the game of his life.</LD>
<LD>   Allen scored a career-high 47 points thanks to a club-record 10
three-point baskets, and the slumping Milwaukee Bucks took a step
toward earning a playoff berth by beating the Charlotte Hornets,
98-91, Sunday at Milwaukee.</LD>
<LD>   "Ray just put them on his shoulders and wouldn't let them lose,"
Hornet Coach Paul Silas said. "That's what great players are supposed
to do."</LD>
<TE>   Allen's eight three-point baskets after halftime tied an NBA
record for three-pointers in a half and his 47 points were the most
by a Buck player since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar scored 50 against Portland
on Jan. 19, 1975.</TE>
<TE>   Allen has been playing all season with knee tendinitis and an
atrophied thigh muscle in his left leg--the result of Philadelphia's
Eric Snow banging into him during Game 7 of the Eastern Conference
finals last year.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the confidence I think I needed, working through having
the injured knee, and the confidence my team needed," Allen said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bucks, in danger of falling from Eastern Conference favorite
to the draft lottery in one of the biggest collapses in league
history, ended a five-game losing streak and won for only the fifth
time in 20 games.</TE>
<TE>   The Bucks (40-40) are battling with Toronto and Indiana for the
final two playoff spots in the East.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 95, Orlando 89--The injury-depleted 76ers are playing
playoff-caliber basketball at just the right time.</TE>
<TE>   Despite playing without three injured starters, including Allen
Iverson, Philadelphia clinched a postseason berth by beating the
Magic at Orlando, Fla., behind Eric Snow's 22 points and Dikembe
Mutombo's 18 points and 12 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   The 76ers have won three consecutive games and four of their last
five to tie Orlando for fourth place in the Eastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Iverson, sidelined by a broken left hand, the 76ers
were without Aaron McKie (scratched cornea) and Derrick Coleman
(hyperextended left knee).</TE>
<TE>   "This is about as satisfying a win as we've had," 76er Coach Larry
Brown said. "Plus, we played as a team, which was the best part."</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 86, Washington 80--For a while, it seemed the Pacers might
have to spend the summer living with the fact that they were locked
out of the playoffs by the Wizards. Jermaine O'Neal wouldn't let it
happen. Neither would Reggie Miller.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal scored 26 points and Miller made a key three-point basket
with three minutes left at to play at Washington as the Pacers kept
alive their hopes of making the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 101, New Jersey 82--The Raptors held onto sole possession
of seventh place in the Eastern Conference by routing the Nets at
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   The Raptors, who have won 11 of 12 since losing Vince Carter to
season-ending knee surgery, remain a game ahead of Indiana and
Milwaukee for the final two playoff spots.</TE>
<TE>   New York 94, Miami 67--Kurt Thomas scored 20 points and Allan
Houston added 19 as the Knicks, playing without suspended guard
Latrell Sprewell, won at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, the Knicks suspended Sprewell for missing the
morning shoot-around.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis 98, Houston 95--Will Solomon and Stromile Swift made key
free throws in the final four seconds at Houston. The Rockets were
missing three starters, including their top two scorers in Steve
Francis and Cuttino Mobley. Center Kelvin Cato also sat out.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Dallas Mavericks sent a powerful playoff message to the
Sacramento Kings.</LD>
<LD>   Nick Van Exel scored 14 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter as
the Mavericks became the only opponent to win twice at Arco Arena
this season, ending the Kings' 11-game winning streak with a 113-100
victory Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   Raef LaFrentz had 21 points and 13 rebounds, and Steve Nash had 21
points and 13 assists as the Mavericks (56-24), playing without
injured All-Star Dirk Nowitzki, moved into a tie for the lead in the
Midwest Division with San Antonio, which holds the tiebreaker.</LD>
<TE>   Chris Webber had 19 points and nine rebounds for the Kings
(60-20), whose biggest home loss of the season dropped their
league-leading home record to 35-5.</TE>
<TE>   After Michael Finley shot the Mavericks to a big first-half lead,
new Dallas acquisitions LaFrentz and Van Exel combined for 24 of
Dallas' 28 points in the fourth quarter as the Mavericks simply ran
away from the Kings for their seventh victory in nine games.</TE>
<TE>   If these teams meet in the second round of the playoffs, Dallas
will carry a significant psychological edge. The Mavericks have won
five of the last six meetings, and they turned the latest win into a
rare blowout loss for the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   In a game befitting the NBA's two highest-scoring teams, Dallas
matched its up-tempo style with a physical defensive effort against
Webber.</TE>
<TE>   Vlade Divac had 18 points and nine rebounds for the Kings, who
clinched their first Pacific Division title and the NBA's best record
with a victory over the Clippers on Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Since San Antonio took three of four games from the Mavericks in
the season series, Dallas must finish a game ahead of the Spurs to
claim the division title and the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Both teams finish the season with games against Phoenix and Utah.</TE>

<LD>The St. Louis Blues had one of the strongest finishes in the NHL and
the Detroit Red Wings had one of the worst.</LD>
<LD>   Both teams, however, know that none of that matters once the
playoffs start this week.</LD>
<LD>   St. Louis got goals from five players and defeated the Red Wings,
5-3, Sunday at Detroit.</LD>
<TE>   The Blues, which will play host to Chicago in the first round
later this week, won the final four games of the regular season and
eight of 11.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit, which will play Vancouver in the first round and has the
league's best record, is winless in seven and has only one victory in
10 games.</TE>
<TE>   There was pushing and shoving throughout, resulting in nine
penalties for each team, and when Cory Stillman scored the final goal
at 18:19 of the third--after hitting Detroit goaltender Dominik Hasek
near the neck with his stick--a several-minute delay ensued as fans
threw debris on the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "These two teams are very competitive, and Detroit-St. Louis is a
big rivalry," Tkachuk said. "We always play them that way, and that's
the way hockey should be played."</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 3, Philadelphia 1--Dave Scatchard scored early
in the third period to break a tie at Uniondale, N.Y., helping the
Islanders secure fifth place in the Eastern Conference and a
first-round playoff series with the Toronto Maple Leafs. Philadelphia
will play Ottawa in the first round of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 6, Nashville 4--The Coyotes scored four goals in the third
period at Phoenix to lock up the victory and sixth place in the
Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 4, Minnesota 2--Josh Green had two unassisted goals and
backup goalie Jussi Markkanen made 30 saves for the Oilers at St.
Paul, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 2, Columbus 0--Eric Daze scored his 200th career goal and
the host Blackhawks clinched the fifth seed in the Western
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 2, Colorado 2--Steven Reinprecht scored with 2:59 left in
regulation at Denver and the Avalanche secured home-ice advantage for
the first two rounds of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 2, Atlanta 2--Martin Gelinas scored in the third period
at Atlanta, helping Southeast Division-champion Carolina stay
unbeaten in 15 games all-time against the Trashers.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 3, Florida 2--Vincent Lecavalier scored during a two-man
advantage in overtime at Sunrise, Fla. Lecavalier's 20th goal made
him the first player in team history to post three consecutive
20-goal seasons.</TE>

<LD>They came to Augusta National, they didn't like what they saw, and
so, coincidence or no, they are both calling it a day.</LD>
<LD>   Arnold Palmer got out early, just as soon as his rain-delayed
second round hobbled into the clubhouse Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Ken Venturi had to stick it out until the very ugly end, much to
his disbelieving dismay.</LD>
<TE>   It was not the most satisfying of exits for these two Masters
fixtures.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer played his last Masters, ending a streak of 48 in a row,
after taking a look at the newly reconfigured course and assessing:
Too much, too long. Venturi, at the same time, called his last
Masters, ending a streak of 35 in a row, after taking a look at
Sunday's final-round field and assessing: Too many gone wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen a lot of Masters, I've been here a long time, but I've
never seen a Sunday like this in my life," Venturi said as he watched
Ernie Els and Vijay Singh take turns going deep-water golfing.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could explain myself," Venturi continued, sounding more
exasperated than Retief Goosen and Phil Mickelson, who also were
spiraling fast out of contention.</TE>
<TE>   "On the leaderboard, we have six of the top seven leading players
in the world [struggling]. I don't know if it's, 'Am I playing safe?
Am I going too much for it? Is Tiger going to win [and] there's no
need trying?' Where are we going?"</TE>
<TE>   Not to Butler Cabin, that much was certain.</TE>
<TE>   Venturi ticked off the list of the scattered, one-time challengers
to Woods in this tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody to me, looking at them, they all look--Singh,
Mickelson, Goosen, Els, [Sergio] Garcia--they all look confused," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   None of them were doing much of anything right, except, Venturi
noted, "making sure Tiger wins."</TE>
<TE>   CBS' golf experts found themselves in strange territory during
Sunday's final round of the Masters: Tiger Woods was in the lead,
right where they had wanted him four days earlier, and the tournament
with (all together now) "a tradition unlike any other" had turned
into a dud unlike any other.</TE>
<TE>   Woods wasn't charging to his third Masters championship, he was
coasting, laying back into a golf-version four-corners offense while
everyone once within striking range kept tripping over their spike
marks.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the also-rans were playing so poorly, in Venturi's
estimation, it was hurting Woods, who appeared at times to be playing
down to the competition.</TE>
<TE>   "Tiger hasn't been challenged," Venturi said, "and that's why
we're not seeing the Tiger Woods that we've watched play here [in the
past]."</TE>
<TE>   CBS ran a montage of Woods' first two Masters victories, with Jim
Nantz, who likes to label, piping up again with his handy nicknames
for each.</TE>
<TE>   Woods' record-breaking first Masters title, in 1997, was, of
course, "The Win For The Ages."</TE>
<TE>   His second, in 2001, was, if you needed reminding, "The Tiger
Slam."</TE>
<TE>   Nantz, however, didn't have anything at the ready for this one.</TE>
<TE>   How about: "Tiger And The Tanked."</TE>
<TE>   With Woods on the 13th hole and every other one-time threat in
full-scale retreat, Venturi called them as he saw them.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at the first seven names on the leaderboard--I can't
believe the aggregate scores," he said. "Of the seven names on top of
the leaderboard, their aggregate is plus-five. The low score so far
is [shared by] Tiger Woods and Jose Maria Olazabal, who are both one
under. One player today has broken 70 and that's [Shigeki] Maruyama,
and he shot 67....</TE>
<TE>   "I was expecting some really good scoring today."</TE>
<TE>   Big scoring is what he got: Singh carded a quadruple-bogey nine on
15, and Els hit water twice en route to an agonizing-to-behold
triple-bogey eight on 13.</TE>
<TE>   Venturi was there at 13 for the complete dissection, describing
Els' slow trudge into the rough and along the creek as a long "walk
of dejection." After Els dried his golf ball, took a drop and knocked
his next shot back into the creek, Venturi was rightly horrified.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh boy!" he exclaimed. "This is ... this is crazy!"</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't supposed to be how the Masters played out. At least
according to the advertising. The best of the best? Sunday belonged
to the busts of the busts.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh ... wow," David Feherty lamented as Singh splashed down short
of the 15th green. "This is like watching a, I don't know, just a
train wreck in slow motion."</TE>
<TE>   And what music best accompanies a train wreck?</TE>
<TE>   Soft, tinkling piano.</TE>
<TE>   That's what viewers got as they were still mulling Feherty's
graphic word picture. A lovely, lilting bit of piano--CBS' trademark
ode to the grandness of the Masters--which evidently couldn't be
subbed on the spot with Beck's much more appropriate "Loser."</TE>
<TE>   For the record, Venturi had planned to make this his final Masters
long before Sunday's dog day afternoon. He had hoped for a better
send-off, as had Palmer, but, you know, that's golf.</TE>
<TE>   In the Butler Cabin, where Masters Chairman Hootie Johnson
presented Woods with the green jacket because Woods couldn't present
it to himself, Venturi talked about his relationship with the
Masters, which began in 1954, with Venturi walking the course as a
player.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I had seen everything here," he mused. "Until I saw
today."</TE>

<HD>Lifestyle Changes Give De La Rosa Purpose</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a time not so long ago in Jose De La Rosa's life when you
were more likely to read about him as a troublemaker or as the victim
of a violent crime than as the top player on the North Hills Monroe
High baseball team.</LD>
<LD>   De La Rosa carved out a humdrum existence his freshman and
sophomore years, associating with gang members and seemingly
attending more funerals than classes. The only regular appearances he
made in school were in the office of counselor Julie Kovacs, who
chided him for indiscretions ranging from truancy to apathy.</LD>
<LD>   Kovacs recently called De La Rosa into her office to reminisce.</LD>
<TE>   "Do you remember three years ago when you would get mad?" she
asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I just started cussing," De La Rosa recalled. "I didn't really
care."</TE>
<TE>   "And now?"</TE>
<TE>   "I just walk away."</TE>
<TE>   De La Rosa smiled shyly. The senior who speaks in short, choppy
sentences has come a long way since those dim days when he had to
walk straight home from school with his friends for fear of being
beat up if he stuck around for baseball practice and walked home
alone.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as a shortstop and team captain batting .357 in his second
year with the Vikings, he is on track to become the first member of
his family to graduate from high school. If everything falls into
place, he might even attend a junior college.</TE>
<TE>   De La Rosa attributes much of his turnaround to baseball, the
sport that has captivated him since age 5.</TE>
<TE>   "I love baseball," he said. "That's my thing."</TE>
<TE>   The sport has kept him in class--and in school, for that matter.
It has pushed him to study even after a long day at school, practice
and his job as a go-cart attendant. And it has made him consider
college, even though he had long figured he would go straight to work
to support his toddler son.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what baseball is about, to help [kids] become productive
in life," Monroe Coach David Muskrath said. "It's a super long shot
that any one of them is ever going to go to the major leagues, but if
they have fun and learn how to be productive in life--how to get
things done on time, be responsible and show good work ethics--that's
what matters."</TE>
<TE>   Muskrath looks at De La Rosa and sees a little bit of himself. The
first-year coach was once headed to a junior college with no grand
plans but two years later enrolled at Cal State Northridge and went
on to become an English teacher.</TE>
<TE>   But Muskrath never had to contend with the obstacles confronting
De La Rosa. The teenager spent his first few years of high school in
a gang-infested neighborhood, where he hung out with the rough crowd
but somehow resisted the temptation to join a gang.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd go out and drink and act dumb," De La Rosa said.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, the fallout was more serious than a hangover. De La
Rosa attended the funerals of three friends who were shot and killed.
Another friend was shot in the mouth but survived. De La Rosa has
relocated to a more peaceful neighborhood in Panorama City.</TE>
<TE>   De La Rosa was thrown another curve in September of his junior
year, when the girl he had been dating for about a year gave birth to
a boy. Yet, De La Rosa didn't look at his little Anthony as a burden
but a catalyst for change.</TE>
<TE>   "When I had my kid," he said, "I knew I had to do good in school
if I wanted a career."</TE>
<TE>   So De La Rosa went to class regularly and did his homework. He
found that when he put his mind to it, a funny thing happened: He
succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   When baseball season rolled around, De La Rosa was eligible to
join the team for the first time. He started making new friends such
as Alex Reyes, an infielder with an ebullient personality and a
penchant for doing the right thing.</TE>
<TE>   Everything was going well until his grades slipped late in the
season and he had to sit out the last couple of weeks. But that
wasn't the rest of the story.</TE>
<TE>   De La Rosa returned to school last fall even more determined to
keep his grades up so that he could play an entire season and not
make his mom regret her decision to pre-order his graduation ring. He
also wanted to succeed for the twin brother he never knew.</TE>
<TE>   "Jose tells me, 'Mom, I have to do good, I have to make something
out of my life for him,'" Emma, Jose's mother, said in Spanish of the
boy who died during childbirth. "Jose says he feels as if he has a
guardian angel looking over him."</TE>
<TE>   De La Rosa showed a tremendous work ethic in fall-winter league,
prompting Muskrath to designate him as a co-captain along with Reyes.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not giving a lackadaisical effort," Reyes said of De La
Rosa. "I see him studying and sometimes he'll call me because he
needs help. I'll give him some insight on the project he's doing or
math class. In baseball, he doesn't need any help."</TE>
<TE>   The 5-foot-11, 190-pounder has a sweet swing but his at-bats have
been limited recently by a lower back injury suffered about a month
ago on a throw to first base. He expects to be in the lineup today
when Monroe (6-6-1, 0-2 in Valley Mission League play) plays at Van
Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   De La Rosa's turnaround isn't complete. He must take a few extra
classes in May and June to complete his graduation requirements, but
with the continued support of Muskrath, Kovacs and his parents, De La
Rosa is well on his way.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in good shape," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The kid still pops into Kovacs' office occasionally, but now it's
only to say, "Hi."</TE>
<TE>   "He's not sent to me anymore, which is nice," Kovacs said. "He
knows that I'm really proud of him, and he's really proud of himself
because he knows how much he's accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows now that he's going to make it."</TE>

<LD>First one out is not a good thing.</LD>
<LD>   Tony Kanaan kicked a retaining wall and put his helmeted head in
his hands. Kanaan stared at his No. 10 Pioneer-WorldCom/Mo Nunn
Racing Honda-Reynard. The car's engine had died, just stopped. The
fast car stood still and Kanaan had just become the first driver out
of the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   In two events this season, Kanaan has scored zero points.</LD>
<TE>   For a moment Kanaan's spirits were low. But not for long. Kanaan,
a 27-year-old Brazilian whose father had raced stock cars on a
Brazilian circuit Kanaan says "is as big as NASCAR," has an
understanding of his life and the place racing has in it. He walked
off the track waving and smiling at the fans. On the way to his
garage, Kanaan signed autographs and told those around him who
thought the day a disaster that they didn't understand disaster.</TE>
<TE>   "I have had three big things, very bad, affect my life and myself
deeply," Kanaan said. "From these things I have grown in my
understanding of what is important and what is not. Being rich and
famous and winning all the races would be nice but not so important.
Helping my friends and family and being a good person who is happy,
that is important."</TE>
<TE>   Last September, in the first major worldwide sporting event held
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Kanaan watched in shock and
despair as his best friend, Alex Zanardi, escaped with his life but
without his legs after a horrific crash at the American Memorial 500.
The race in Germany had been renamed to honor the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Zanardi, an effusively happy and popular Italian CART driver, had
befriended Kanaan nearly a decade earlier. Kanaan had come to Italy
with no ability to speak Italian and no money. The teenager slept on
a mattress on the floor of the garage of the Italian team that had
tabbed Kanaan as a future star. Zanardi, already established as a
driver, took it upon himself to help Kanaan learn the language of
both the word and the car.</TE>
<TE>   The two had remained friends, close enough to talk on the phone
several times a week as Kanaan made his way from Italy and Formula 3
racing; to the U.S., and the Indy Lights series (in 1997 Kanaan won
the Indy Lights season championship); and onto the CART series in
1998. Last year, for the first time, Kanaan and Zanardi became
teammates on the Mo Nunn Racing Team on the CART circuit.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the best thing, to have my friend on the team," Kanaan
said. "And then came the accident."</TE>
<TE>   Kanaan spent six days in the hospital with Zanardi, helping
Zanardi's wife, waiting for his mentor to come out of a coma and then
come to grips with the new life ahead, the one where Zanardi would be
without his legs and without his life's love, racing.</TE>
<TE>   "You want me to say what I have learned from Alex?" Kanaan said.
"You must never despair. Alex has never been in despair. He walks
now, on his new legs. He buys shoes. He takes care of his wife and
his son. We talk on the phone, just as before. No different. I don't
treat Alex different because Alex wouldn't want that. We talk like
normal and that's how life must be. You make the new normal."</TE>
<TE>   Kanaan is pretty good at making the new normal. When he was 13, a
driver of go-karts with a derring-do attitude he inherited from his
father, Kanaan suffered the first of the three tragedies of his life.
His father, Tony, died of liver cancer, a shocking illness in a man
who never drank and always had been strong. Kanaan said that as his
father got sicker, "my father put the business of our family into the
name of my uncle, his brother.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly my mother, my sister and I had no money. We had been
comfortable and now we had nothing."</TE>
<TE>   As the man of the little family in Sao Paolo, Kanaan went to work.
He gave go-kart driving lessons and built go-karts to sell. Four
years later the great Brazilian racer Ayrton Senna, who died in a
1994 race crash, recommended Kanaan to an Italian racing team looking
for young, talented Brazilian drivers. "I knew nothing of Italy or
the language, but I wanted to race and so I went," Kanaan said. "I
had nothing but my love of racing and determination to make it."</TE>
<TE>   In so many senses, Kanaan has made it. His two proudest
accomplishments on the track were that Indy Lights title and winning
the 1999 Michigan 500. He lives in Miami now with his 23-year-old
sister, Karen, who is going to school. He is able to send money to
his mother.</TE>
<TE>   But as happy a moment as that 1999 victory was to Kanaan, it is a
year that also brought Kanaan deep sadness. Kanaan's other close
friend in racing was Greg Moore, the young Canadian who was killed in
a 1999 crash in the Marlboro 500 at the California Speedway in
Fontana.</TE>
<TE>   "To lose my father and to have the bad consequences for our
family, and then to lose Greg, my good, dear friend, that was very
hard. From those things, and from Alex's accident, I think I
understand life more. I understand the things that matter are having
great family and great friends and being there for them.</TE>
<TE>   "People laugh when they hear I live with my sister. But my sister
and I were separated for so many years and now we are being reunited
in a way. We have so much fun together. I would be the sad one if she
moved out."</TE>
<TE>   Kanaan had been pleased with earning the sixth spot on Sunday's
starting grid and, on the first turn, had moved up to fifth. His car
had recorded the second-fastest practice time Sunday morning. To have
the engine quit was a huge disappointment to the team but Kanaan
chose to look ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "Tough luck, huh?" Kanaan said. "We'll get 'em next time. That's
the only way to respond to something like this because it's totally
out of your control."</TE>
<TE>   It is the way of racing and of life. Kanaan gets it.</TE>

<LD>Never usually means never.</LD>
<LD>   Except in tennis.</LD>
<LD>   Things have a way of changing in this sport, alliances shift and
reform, which is why some players retire twice or even three times,
and return to a tournament or Davis Cup after saying they would never
come back.</LD>
<TE>   So, after the U.S. Davis Cup team advanced to the semifinals, in
September against France in Paris, it was reasonable to look ahead:
What about Andre Agassi?</TE>
<TE>   The question of his availability certainly was valid. Agassi, the
1999 French Open champion, would drastically change the dynamic of
the U.S. team and alter the odds of success on clay at Roland Garros.
U.S. captain Patrick McEnroe, wisely, already had spoken to Agassi
about the future and said he sensed a flicker of interest.</TE>
<TE>   There was, however, the little matter of this quote:</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have it in me anymore. I just don't."</TE>
<TE>   Agassi said this about his future Davis Cup participation at the
Australian Open in January 2001. He does not like the current format
of the international competition. (Of course, who does in this
country?) That day in Melbourne, Agassi sounded and looked adamant.</TE>
<TE>   But he seemed just as resolute in the past when saying he was
never going to play again, and returned in 2000 for matches at
Zimbabwe and in Los Angeles against the Czech Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Those close to Agassi said he doesn't want to talk about the
issue, referring to his past quotes, most notably at the Australian
Open, saying that statement speaks for itself.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was that the Zimbabwe experience took more out of him
than anyone realized. Agassi had to shoulder more of the load in
Harare because Pete Sampras pulled out because of an injury suffered
in a loss to Agassi at the Australian Open.</TE>
<TE>   Days after winning the Australian Open, Agassi was put into
another tense and heated situation, won both of his singles matches
but got sick on the court the final day. He returned home ill and
injured.</TE>
<TE>   If you look at his record, Agassi would not win another tournament
the rest of that year and took months to regain his equilibrium. At
the remaining three majors in 2000, he lost in the second round of
the French Open, the semifinals at Wimbledon and the second round at
the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Agassi is more cognizant than ever of pushing
himself beyond his limits.</TE>
<TE>   He will turn 32 on April 29, and any sort of draining repeat of
Zimbabwe could be a career-killer at this stage.</TE>
<TE>   So, for now, never appears to mean never. But we won't say it.</TE>
<TE>   Money for Something</TE>
<TE>   Growth does not appear to be a problem at La Costa.</TE>
<TE>   It was relatively interesting to note that the Acura Classic at
the La Costa Resort and Spa, which is July 29-Aug. 4, has increased
its total prize money to $775,000, up from last year's $750,000. The
Tier II tournament has almost always been able to draw a first-rate
field, based upon the setting and the willingness of its organizers
to listen to the players' needs.</TE>
<TE>   "Our decision to increase the amount of total prize money in our
tournament reflects the overall increased popularity of women's
tennis worldwide," tournament director Raquel Giscafre said.</TE>
<TE>   What is more notable is the increase in prize money in the last
few years at this event. In 1998, the total purse was $450,000, and
it jumped up to $535,000 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, prize money in the French Open has gone up for the
women but does not equal the men's. The women's purse increased by
11.5%, and the men's 10.4%.</TE>
<TE>   The Australian Open and U.S. Open are the only Grand Slam events
to offer equal prize money.</TE>
<TE>   Sister Act</TE>
<TE>   If Dinara Safina's WTA debut last week was any indication, her
name will be heard in connection with her game as well as her older
brother Marat Safin's.</TE>
<TE>   Safina, who will turn 16 on April 26, defeated Martina Sucha of
Slovakia, Miriam Oremans of the Netherlands and Maja Matevzic of
Slovenia to reach the Estoril Open semifinals at Portugal. She lost
to qualifier Anca Barna of Germany in the semifinals Saturday, and
had won 20 of 21 matches this year before the loss to Barna.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't wait to be 16 and be able to play more WTA tournaments,"
Safina said.</TE>
<TE>   Safina is ranked 404, and should move to about 240 in the world
this week, the WTA said.</TE>

<HD>Woods Goes to Great Lengths to Win Masters</HD>
<DH>Golf: Unfazed by course changes, sport's best player wins major
title for second year in a row.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.
</DL>
<LD>When Tiger Woods arrived at Augusta National Golf Club for the 66th
Masters tournament, he was greeted by a new course--longer, meaner,
narrower and presumably not nearly as good a fit for him as the green
jacket that came with his victories here in 1997 and 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Yet all the alterations made by the hierarchy at Augusta
National--making nine holes longer and adding nearly 300 yards to the
course, moving tee boxes, planting more trees and enlarging
bunkers--couldn't change the final result: Woods posted a surprisingly
easy three-shot victory over Retief Goosen on Sunday, becoming only the
third golfer to win back-to-back Masters.</LD>
<LD>   The design changes made to one of the sport's most treasured layouts
were supposed to counteract the advantages enjoyed by the long hitters
who have dominated professional golf in recent years, Woods chief among
them.</LD>
<TE>   But Woods shot a one-under-par 71 in the closing round while his
closest challengers failed to mount even the mildest of charges. With his
mother, Kultida; father, Earl; and girlfriend Elin Nordegren watching
closely, Woods, helped by Augusta National Chairman Hootie Johnson,
slipped on the green jacket signifying the Masters champion for a third
time. For the tournament, Woods shot a 12-under 276.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long week," said Woods, who had to play 26 holes Saturday
after rain delayed completion of Friday's second round. "I'm pleased I
kept my focus and stayed strong and managed to come out on top."</TE>
<TE>   Woods began the last round tied for the lead with Goosen, but after he
birdied the second and third holes, Woods held a three-shot lead. No one
managed to move any closer to him. Allowed to play conservatively with
such an advantage over his peers, Woods was not forced to be daring or
aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   It was an unconventional approach for the swashbuckling Woods, but as
the results showed, it was also the correct strategy. When he walked up
the 18th fairway, he removed his cap and allowed himself a rare smile as
the gallery cheered and applauded. Woods barely missed a birdie putt,
then tapped in for his par and raised his arms to celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   "Besides Jack Nicklaus, Tiger is the best player," Goosen said. "Give
him a couple of more years and I think Tiger will be the greatest of all
time.</TE>
<TE>   "He played really solidly and was never really in trouble. Nobody was
putting any pressure on him. He was just cruising in. He knew he had it
in the bag."</TE>
<TE>   Said Woods: "The golf course was playing so difficult early today,
conditions that we were not accustomed to, and I just tried to stay as
patient as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Woods, who five years ago became the first African American to win the
Masters, continues to dominate golf like no one since Nicklaus or Tom
Watson in their prime. Of the last 10 major championships, Woods has won
six.</TE>
<TE>   Since he turned professional in August 1996, Woods has lived a sports
story rarely matched for fame, success and wealth. At 20, he signed his
first endorsement contract with Nike was worth more than $40 million over
five years. Since then, his combined income from endorsements and his
golf game has grown to a reported $20 million annually.</TE>
<TE>   He commands an appearance fee of more than $1 million to play
tournaments that are not sanctioned by the PGA Tour, and off the course,
his corporate partners have grown as his scores have shrunk.</TE>
<TE>   His popularity helped the PGA Tour recently negotiate a new, four-year
contract with a variety of broadcasters for about $850 million, an
increase of 30% over the previous contract.</TE>
<TE>   Woods obviously translates well on television. Saturday's third-round
coverage of the Masters on CBS earned a 7.0 overnight rating and a 17
share, the third highest ever. The only third-round telecasts with higher
ratings were in 1997, when Woods was on his way to his first Masters
triumph, and last year, when he also won. (Ratings for the Sunday
telecast will be released today.) "I hit some good shots and made a
couple of good putts when I absolutely needed them and just really hung
around," Woods said. "And I was able to outlast the guys today."</TE>
<TE>   Winning the Masters gives Woods a shot at becoming the first player
since Bobby Jones in 1930 to win all four major championships in the same
calendar year--the Grand Slam of golf. Woods already has won a version of
the Grand Slam, by taking four consecutive majors over two calendar
years--the U.S. Open, the British Open and the PGA Championship in 2000
before he added the 2001 Masters. Jones' Grand Slam consisted of the
British Amateur and British Open, plus the U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur.</TE>
<TE>   Woods said last week the significance of his Grand Slam accomplishment
did not strike him immediately. He had found himself more in the moment,
of trying to win the tournament that Jones had started in the rolling
Georgia countryside.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely appreciated it more than I did right after I won," Woods
said. "I had won the Masters, it didn't feel like I won four in a row. I
focused so hard on just winning this one tournament. When it was over, it
was like, 'Oh, wow, I just won the Masters.' But your mind does not go
back and say, 'Oh, I won three previous to that.'</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, as time has gone on, and over the last year, I appreciate
it a lot more. I was too close at the time."</TE>
<TE>   Woods has seven major championship titles in less than six full
seasons as a professional, at the age of 26 years, three months, 14 days.
By comparison, Nicklaus won his seventh major title at the U.S. Open at
Baltusrol in 1967 at the age of 27 years, four months, 28 days. Woods
turns 27 on Dec. 30.</TE>
<TE>   His seven major titles tie Jones and Arnold Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   Woods has won 31 PGA Tour events, well short of Nicklaus' total of 70,
which he accomplished in 25 years between 1962 and 1986. Strangely
enough, Nicklaus' first victory as a professional was the 1962 U.S. Open
and his last was the 1986 Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus remains the goal for Woods, especially his total of 18 major
championship titles. As a child growing up in Cypress, Woods taped a list
of Nicklaus' accomplishments to the wall of his bedroom. Woods' total of
seven in six years compares favorably to Nicklaus, who had six in his
first six years.</TE>
<TE>   Woods also is halfway to Nicklaus' record of six Masters titles.
Nicklaus, who won in 1963, 1965, 1966, 1972, 1975 and 1986, when he was
46, leads Palmer, who had four victories at Augusta National.</TE>
<TE>   Woods is next with three, tied with Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead, Gary
Player and Nick Faldo.</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus was 25 days younger than Woods at comparative stages when
they won their third Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Woods earned $1,008,000 for his victory Sunday and leads this year's
PGA Tour money list with $2,685,000, even though he has played only eight
tournaments. Woods is also the leading money winner in the history of
professional golf with $28.87 million.</TE>

<HD>Powell Talks to Both Sides; No Progress</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Arafat says Israel must withdraw troops from West Bank
before he will crack down on militants. But Sharon gives U.S. secretary
no timetable for a pullback.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met with Yasser Arafat for three
hours Sunday at the Palestinian leader's besieged and bullet-scarred
headquarters here but came away without a commitment to end a wave of
suicide bombings before an Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.</LD>
<LD>   In a meeting later with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, Powell
also came up empty-handed. Sharon would not commit himself to a timetable
for a pullback.</LD>
<LD>   Powell called his first meeting with Arafat, under the watchful eye of
Israeli troops just a few yards away, a "useful and constructive
exchange." In blunt terms, the secretary repeatedly told Arafat that the
suicide attacks are a major barrier to any progress on Palestinian hopes
for an independent state, according to a senior State Department
official.</LD>
<TE>   "We've always said that Chairman Arafat has authority, has leadership,
he has stature within his community, within the Arab world [and] that he
needs to speak clearly about how this violence harms the Palestinian
case," the official told reporters traveling with Powell.</TE>
<TE>   But Powell was unable to settle the basic chicken-and-egg conundrum
concerning conditions to achieve a cease-fire in the deadlocked
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the Israelis complete their withdrawal, we will, as
Palestinians, carry out our obligations," senior Arafat advisor Saeb
Erekat told reporters after the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview later, Erekat added: "We need to have two sides, and
we have only one side involved so far. . . . We're willing to do
something as soon as we have a Palestinian Authority again, but we have
no authority now."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of promising a crackdown, Arafat spent the first hour of the
meeting outlining the specifics of the humanitarian crisis and
deteriorating conditions in the reoccupied Palestinian areas,
particularly Jenin and Bethlehem.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting featured "no breakthroughs" and "no blowups," said one
U.S. official who was present.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Powell shuttled to Tel Aviv for a second round of talks
with Sharon to push again for Israel to expedite a pullback from the West
Bank. These talks were described as "very good and thorough" by State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher.</TE>
<TE>   But according to Israeli sources, Powell did not get a date from
Sharon for an Israeli withdrawal.</TE>
<TE>   "The prime minister said we will pull out as soon as possible, and
where there is no more terror we will pull out," said Sharon spokesman
Raanan Gissin. "But the problem is the Palestinians have done nothing. We
did not give a deadline, and Secretary Powell did not ask for one."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon stuck to his hard-line positions on several issues, including
the Israeli siege of Arafat's headquarters, Gissin indicated.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, rather than move to end the incursion, Sharon's Cabinet
approved plans Sunday to set up buffer zones in three locations to keep
Palestinians out of Israel. Sharon has said the army, when it completes
its offensive in the West Bank, will pull back to these zones, which will
be located near the border between the West Bank and Israel in the
vicinity of the West Bank city of Tulkarm, opposite the Israeli Arab town
of Umm al Fahm and near Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   The buffer zone plan is controversial because it would establish a
permanent Israeli presence on West Bank land.</TE>
<TE>   The Cabinet also debated Sharon's proposal that Israeli troops enter
Arafat's headquarters to capture suspects in connection with last year's
assassination of an Israeli Cabinet minister. Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres was reported to have objected vehemently to that plan. Israel
believes two of the suspects are holed up with Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   So at the end of the day, after rebuffs by both sides, a breakthrough
in Powell's diplomatic rescue mission appeared as elusive as ever.</TE>
<TE>   The secretary has begun exploring several ideas with the two sides to
resolve both immediate problems and long-term issues. One area of urgent
focus is the standoff in Bethlehem at the Church of the Nativity, where
more than 100 Palestinian gunmen sought refuge April 2 from invading
Israeli troops. The bodies of two Palestinians who have been shot dead
during the siege remain in the church.</TE>
<TE>   Because the standoff is a major problem for both sides, the United
States is focusing on it as a microcosm of the broader confrontation. If
it can be solved, that may serve as proof that cooperation is possible.</TE>
<TE>   "We've discussed Bethlehem for a couple of days. Arafat identifies
Bethlehem as one of his top issues, so it's worth the effort," the senior
State Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Gissin said, Sharon asked Powell to relay one proposal to
Arafat: Surrender the Palestinian gunmen to a third party, such as the
International Committee of the Red Cross, or agree to their permanent
exile from their homeland.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone not suspected of participating in attacks on Israelis "would be
free to go home," Gissin said. Those on Israel's wanted list would be
allowed to choose between going on trial in an Israeli military court or
accepting exile from the Palestinian-ruled territories.</TE>
<TE>   "They will sign a paper where they will leave the country forever,"
Gissin said by telephone Sunday evening.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Israel had insisted that the gunmen surrender their weapons
to the Israeli army and stand trial in an Israeli military court. But the
Israelis would like to resolve an impasse that has produced the
embarrassing spectacle of Israeli tanks ringing the 4th century basilica
revered by the world's Christians.</TE>
<TE>   Salah Tamari, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council from
Bethlehem, rejected the Israeli offer, however.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a people who suffered exile for 30 years, and we are not going
to allow anybody to send any of our people into exile again," said
Tamari, who was appointed by Arafat to negotiate an end to the stalemate.
And the Palestinian Authority, he said, would not agree to handing
fighters over to be tried in Israeli military courts.</TE>
<TE>   "We have laws; we have our courts; and when any Palestinian violates
our law, he stands before our court," Tamari said. "Sharon's the last
person on earth to talk about law, morality and the blood on the hands of
Palestinians."</TE>
<TE>   Powell is also exploring the idea of holding an international
conference--including the Israelis, Palestinians and some or all of the
Arab world--to resolve the broader political question of a final
settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, according to U.S.,
Israeli and Palestinian officials.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech late Sunday, Sharon predicted that the U.S. would convene
a conference.</TE>
<TE>   "We are ready to have a regional conference in which a number of
countries would participate--Israel, Egypt, the Saudis, Jordan, Morocco
and Palestinian representatives. It doesn't have to be limited to these,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The conference would be hosted by the United States. This idea is
acceptable to the United States, and I estimate that within a short
period of time, the conference will indeed convene," added Sharon, who
proposed a conference before last month's Arab League summit, at which
the Arab world offered Israel recognition in exchange for its return of
territories it occupied in the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   Erekat confirmed that Powell also discussed the concept of a
conference with Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon has stipulated that Arafat would not be allowed at any
conference--a condition that would be unacceptable to both the
Palestinians and the Arab world.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said Sunday that the
United States is considering "anything" to further the peace process but
does not want to act prematurely.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to get Powell back here after his mission is complete. A
lot has happened in the last week or so, and we need to assess where we
are. But we're looking at a number of ideas that might move this forward.
Any conference, any meeting has to proceed from a set of principles,"
Rice said on NBC's "Meet the Press."</TE>
<TE>   Powell's peace mission also took on a new component Sunday with the
announcement that he will travel to Lebanon and Syria today to try to
defuse escalating hostilities along Israel's border with the two
countries.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has become increasingly concerned that the
daily exchanges between Hezbollah guerrillas and the Israeli military
across Israel's roughly 50-mile border with Lebanon will open up a new
front. Powell will hold talks with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri
in Beirut and Syrian President Bashar Assad in Damascus about trying to
rein in Hezbollah.</TE>

<HD>Alaskans Pin Hopes on Drilling in Refuge</HD>
<DH>Economy: The proposed oil project would help the state solve
mounting fiscal problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE
</DL>
<LD>It's tax day for most Americans, but here in Alaska, nobody is
writing a check to the state. There is no state income tax. To the
contrary, Alaska sent a $1,850.28 check in October to every man, woman
and child in the state.</LD>
<LD>   The annual Permanent Fund bonanza fuels everything from new big-screen
TVs in Anchorage to all-night gambling parties in the bush. The windfall
is thanks to royalties from the million barrels of oil flowing every day
out of Alaska's North Slope.</LD>
<LD>   It is one of the biggest reasons why Alaska--more than President
Bush's energy advisors, probably more than the oil companies--wants to
see the U.S. Senate open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil
drilling. This week's expected debate is the culmination of a $7-million
lobbying campaign in which the state has ferried members of Congress to
one of the most remote places on Earth and hired lobbyists to work in a
dozen crucial states.</LD>
<TE>   The oil dividends are also a big reason why Alaska has given major tax
breaks to oil companies, why Alaska has tolerated the effects of dozens
of serious oil spills on its North Slope, why Alaska is moving to roll
back some of its permitting regulations on the oil industry.</TE>
<TE>   The boom years are over. Prudhoe Bay, the biggest oil field in North
America, is sending only half the amount of oil down the trans-Alaska
pipeline that it did during the 1980s. The state, which depends on oil
money for more than 80% of its budget, is facing a shortfall of $865
million--nearly half the general fund. Alaska is running through its
$2.6-billion oil savings account so fast it will likely run dry within
four years.</TE>
<TE>   What to do? Adopt an income tax? Pass a sales tax? Or start pumping
more oil? For about 70% of Alaskans polled recently, it's a no-brainer.</TE>
<TE>   In a state that has tried for years to develop a well-rounded
economy--tourism has boomed, fishing is suffering but still
profitable--it is oil that continues to fuel the state treasury, and oil
and gas that remain the cornerstone of Alaskans' planning for their
futures.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like cocaine," said Kip Knudson, general manager of Era
Aviation, a regional carrier. "Without it, we just don't have the
population base nor the property tax base to support the life to which we
have become accustomed. We are about as Third World as you can get. We
are completely dependent on resource extraction, and we don't know what
to do without it."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, an increasingly vocal lobby of environmental
groups--empowered by the spectacular growth in tourism, which depends on
Alaska's pristine landscape--has raised questions about the environmental
costs of oil development.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute on the local scene goes far beyond the caribou and their
calving grounds that have been the focus of the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge debate. While the oil fields at Prudhoe Bay are probably the
best-operated in the world, there has been an average of nearly 400
spills a year on the North Slope since 1996, involving more than 1.3
million gallons of diesel, crude oil and hydraulic oil. While most
incidents were minor, 79 spills were greater than 1,000 gallons.</TE>
<TE>Personnel Matters Raise Questions</TE>
<TE>   In the last few weeks, the state Department of Environmental
Conservation, which has no full-time inspectors on the North Slope, has
been rocked by the March 5 resignation of its oil spill prevention and
cleanup supervisor, Susan Harvey, who had been removed from spill
oversight duties two months earlier. The department said her workload was
too heavy, but co-workers said she had been punished for regulating the
oil industry too vigorously.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks later, an air quality supervisor for the state Department
of Natural Resources, Bill MacClarence, was charged with insubordination
for complaining outside the chain of command about the method used to
measure oil industry air pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an issue the state doesn't want to deal with, because it's
pretty sensitive politically. Because it involves a lot of money,"
MacClarence said.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows how bad the air is on the North Slope, he said, because
no one monitors it. "I can tell you, I've been up there, and it's not
pleasant," he said. "In the dead of winter, it takes your breath away."</TE>
<TE>   These revelations are providing ammunition for the environmental
community in Alaska, which has worked for years to try to persuade the
government to wean the state off oil.</TE>
<TE>   "The oil industry's record has been one of chronic, continual spills,
leaks, improper disposal of waste, long-term contaminated sites that are
still needing to be cleaned up," said Pam Miller, head of Fairbanks-based
Arctic Connections, who opposes drilling in the wildlife refuge.</TE>
<TE>   Yet a good many Alaskans--most, probably--don't see it that way. They
point to the industry's record of rapidly cleaning up spills and the fact
that, after two decades of operations on the North Slope, the
consequences have been minimal. The caribou herd at Prudhoe actually has
prospered under oil development, growing from 3,000 in 1974 to about
27,000 today.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Rosier, president of the Alaska Outdoor Council, the largest
fishing, hunting and trapping group in the state, said oil revenue allows
the state to protect wilderness. "In the absence of these revenues, it
could hamper natural resource management and impair those resources
everyone would like to protect," he told Congress recently.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, proponents of drilling in the refuge say conservationists who
oppose drilling in the heavily regulated Arctic are effectively pushing
oil production to areas of the world where its environmental costs are
likely to be much greater.</TE>
<TE>   "They [drilling opponents] make it seem like an anti-environment vote,
that we are going to destroy the coastal plain. Like anyone in Alaska has
any interest in destroying the Arctic environment," complained Kim Duke,
executive director of Arctic Power, the group lobbying for opening the
refuge to oil exploration.</TE>
<TE>   "They put a little polar bear picture on something and say, 'The big
oil industry wants to destroy the polar bear, send us $25. . . .,' " she
said. "And they don't point out that the population of all wildlife
species on the slope has maintained, or grown."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody wants that message heard more than the Alaskan government. To
that end, the state has poured $7.3 million into funding Arctic Power's
lobbying efforts since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   With the money, supplemented by large grants from the oil industry,
Arctic Power has flown lawmakers up to see the refuge and hired lobbyists
and public relations consultants in Washington in an attempt to sway
Congress to open it for drilling. Efforts were successful in the House,
which approved the drilling last year.</TE>
<TE>   The lobbying group produced a video on how ice roads constructed to
oil fields can allow drilling with minimal or no damage to the underlying
tundra. Footage from the video, along with other shots of the stark,
frozen coastal plain, made it onto the Interior Department Web site,
prompting U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) last week to accuse
Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton of illegally using lobbying material to
argue for opening the refuge.</TE>
<TE>   A chunk of the lobbying money also went to the tiny Eskimo village of
Kaktovik, which lies on the edge of the coastal plain and is hoping to
access its own oil reserves underneath the refuge. Kaktovik elders were
paid $100 honorariums for news interviews, along with substantial travel
expenses for regular trips to Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   State officials tend to view the Arctic Power expenditures as an
investment in the state's economic stability.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no place in America with the huge quantity of oil our nation
needs than beneath a small portion of the [refuge]," Gov. Tony Knowles
said in his Jan. 16 State of the State address. "This environmentally
responsible development will create tens of thousands of jobs in Alaska
and throughout America. We must keep a full-court press working . . . to
open ANWR this year."</TE>
<TE>   Though revenue from the refuge wouldn't start flowing for at least 10
years, state petroleum economist Chuck Logsdon said drilling could bring
$500 million a year to Alaska's treasury.</TE>
<TE>   With the $2.6 billion in the state's oil-funded budget reserve
scheduled to be depleted around 2004 to 2006, something needs to happen
soon, economists say.</TE>
<TE>   Legal settlements from the oil industry fund the reserve, which is
different from the Permanent Fund, which survives on leasing and royalty
deposits.</TE>
<TE>Searching for Long-Term Solutions</TE>
<TE>   "For 10 years, we've been able to draw on money we've had in the bank.
. . . But that source is disappearing fast," said Scott Goldsmith of the
University of Alaska's Institute of Social and Economic Research.</TE>
<TE>   The wildlife refuge, he said, can't be the solution, not in the long
run. The ultimate answer, he said, must be either to implement a
broad-based tax or to tap into the earnings of the Permanent Fund, an
option that could raise $800 million a year. That fund, which began
tucking away a portion of oil revenue in 1977, has earned $25 billion
since then and paid out $11 billion in dividends, which cost the fund
about $1 billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   Knowles has proposed a state income tax that would raise $350 million
and other tax increases that would raise $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   The governor has also proposed a $4.8-million spending package that
would streamline processing for oil and gas permit applications for
exploration and development and hire inspectors for the North Slope.</TE>
<TE>   But conservation groups fear that, with the Legislature slashing the
budget, the new inspectors will never be funded.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Legislature is reviewing a package of bills that would
significantly roll back some of the stringent measures adopted after the
1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.</TE>
<TE>   The bills make it easier to obtain water use and solid waste permits,
and lift a requirement that the state order oil companies to plan for the
best available technology in cleaning up possible spills.</TE>
<TE>   "In our view, [the state is] just blowing off a lot of spill plan and
air quality laws on the North Slope, to the point that their own
employees are screaming about it," said Peter Van Tuyn, litigation
director for Trustees of Alaska, a conservation group. "It is a very
significant rollback."</TE>
<TE>   State officials say they already monitor oil activities more
stringently than any other industry. Only 17% of the hazardous material
spills in the state occurred on the North Slope, noted Larry Diedrick,
director of the DEC's division of spill prevention and response.</TE>
<TE>   Knudson, the Era Aviation executive, said he and other businessmen
support opening the wildlife refuge because they know the industry has
done a good job so far. "I think the general theory among Alaskans is
that people in the Lower 48 are ignorant. They screwed up their states
and they're going to make it right in Alaska," Knudson said.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, he was in Los Angeles, and the refuge came up. "They were
all opposing it," he recalled. "I said, 'How can you possibly live in
Southern California and be opposed to more oil development?' They didn't
get it. They went home and turned on their air conditioning."</TE>

<DH>Conflict: Residents of the Jenin refugee camp speak of the
viciousness of the Israeli attack.</DH>

<DL>JENIN, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Lukea Tomei could only watch through a peephole as one neighbor was
shot, his arms in the air. She cried out when she saw an elderly woman
blasted by a sniper.</LD>
<LD>   But she could stay still no longer when she saw a little girl
wandering through a mine-filled street.</LD>
<LD>   "The soldiers told me not to go out, but I didn't listen to them,"
said Tomei, a Palestinian nurse who rushed outside to snatch the girl to
safety. "I could not sit by any longer."</LD>
<TE>   Nearly two weeks after the Israeli army launched the bloodiest battle
in the West Bank since the 1967 Middle East War, there is growing
testimony that its victory at the Jenin refugee camp was marred by human
rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli soldiers shot unarmed civilians, bulldozed people alive and
blocked access to medical care, according to more than a dozen witnesses
who spoke Sunday in a temporary shelter just outside the smoldering camp.</TE>
<TE>   Their accounts, which could not be independently confirmed, painted a
picture of a vicious house-to-house battle in which Israeli soldiers
faced Palestinian gunmen intermixed with the camp's civilian population.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli forces escorted a group of reporters into the blasted camp
Sunday for the first time since the start of the offensive. The body of
one bearded Palestinian gunman lay in the street, covered with flies.
Homes and other buildings were flattened. Israeli soldiers said they had
found booby traps throughout the camp.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officers said they had almost achieved their objective of
ridding the camp of militants, noting that half the suicide bombers who
have killed scores of Israelis during the last 18 months came from the
Jenin camp, which was established in 1953.</TE>
<TE>   But late in the day, after the group of reporters had left this city,
fighting flared anew. Explosions that locals said were charges designed
to blow down doors could be heard. Machine-gun fire rattled, and tank
fire boomed. Black smoke billowed from one side of the camp, once home to
13,000 refugees.</TE>
<TE>   A local man, speaking by telephone, said that few people remained in
the camp, which lacked water and telephone service, though power was
restored late Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in despair," said the man, who identified himself as Waleed
Zagha, a father of three. "We can smell the rotting bodies."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli officials put the number of dead at 23 Israeli soldiers
and about 70 Palestinians, though they said more bodies might be found
under 25-foot-high piles of rubble. Palestinians have insisted that
between 300 and 500 people were killed in almost two weeks of fighting.</TE>
<TE>   The final toll may remain controversial. On Sunday, Israel's Supreme
Court denied a bid by Israeli Arab politicians and human rights groups to
block the burial of bodies by the army. It said the army was entitled to
bury the dead if Palestinian authorities failed to do so, although it
recommended that the International Committee of the Red Cross be
involved.</TE>
<TE>   Military officials denied that any massacres or human rights
violations had taken place.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the houses we approached on entering the camp were empty [of
civilians]. The camp was ready for war," Lt. Yoni Wolff, commander of a
platoon involved in the battle, told reporters. "We saw very few
civilians. Some old ladies and children were made to hold a gun in front
of terrorists to make it hard for us to fight back."</TE>
<TE>   Many of those who fled the camp in the last few days have wound up at
the headquarters of the local Muslim charity and school, where about
2,000 people were packed into two buildings without running water.</TE>
<TE>   There, as tanks rumbled through the city's deserted and devastated
streets, more than a dozen witnesses independently described a pattern of
attacks against civilian targets that began April 3, the first day of the
Israeli assault, and continued until Saturday, when the camp was nearly
vacated.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those interviewed said they had seen Israeli soldiers shoot at
unarmed civilians or bulldoze occupied houses. Others said Israeli
soldiers had prevented wounded people from seeking medical treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Still others said Israeli soldiers had detained them and threatened
them with death before releasing them.</TE>
<TE>   On the first night of the invasion, Tomei ran from a United Nations
clinic in the camp to seek shelter in the nearby home of a cousin. Later,
as she watched through a peephole, she saw a man walk into the street,
holding his stomach, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "He had no guns. He said: 'I want a doctor. I want to go to the
hospital,' " Tomei said. "They shot him."</TE>
<TE>   Tomei and a second witness, Baha Awad, 20, a worker for the
Palestinian ambulance service, also described an incident in the early
days of the invasion when Israeli soldiers ordered a family out of a
house with loudspeakers, then proceeded to bulldoze it.</TE>
<TE>   The family ran out, screaming that they had been forced to leave
behind their mentally handicapped son. Army officials denied that they
had buried civilians alive.</TE>
<TE>   "We never bulldozed houses if we knew civilians were inside, only when
firing persisted despite our repeated calls for surrender," Wolff told
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The battle grew heated in the center of the camp, in two neighborhoods
known as Al Damaj and Al Hawashin.</TE>
<TE>   There, Israeli and Palestinian sources said, about 200 Palestinian
fighters holed up in various homes, vowing to fight to the end. At least
13 Israeli soldiers were killed by an explosion in the area Tuesday. That
represented the Israel Defense Forces' heaviest loss in a single incident
since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Gasan Haija, 22, who identified himself as a Palestinian fighter, said
the Palestinians managed to get into positions all around the Israelis in
the two neighborhoods, which are filled with winding alleys only a few
feet wide.</TE>
<TE>   Haija, who said he was throwing pipe bombs from a home, was shot by a
sniper. On Sunday, he lay in a bed in the temporary shelter, a metal bolt
protruding from his shattered leg and a bullet wound in his side.</TE>
<TE>   "They got stuck in the middle of the camp. That was where they ran
into trouble," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the confusing days at the beginning of the battle, camp residents
said, the Israelis brought in helicopter gunships to provide cover for
bulldozers to knock down buildings and clear out the warren of alleyways
in the camp's center.</TE>
<TE>   Kamel Ali, 48, said his son and a friend, both 20, were fleeing from
one home to another April 5 when a rocket struck, killing both young men.
Ali said neither was armed.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, on April 8, Ali and four other men were rounded up
by Israeli soldiers, taken outside and made to strip. One man who said he
spoke Hebrew said he heard the soldiers discussing whether to execute the
men in a store or beside a car. The men, frightened, wrote their names on
a nearby wall as a memorial to their killings.</TE>
<TE>   Then, after three hours, the Israelis handed the men white T-shirts
and told them to leave the camp.</TE>
<TE>   "Such acts only solidify hatred in our children, when they see such
humiliating things," said one of the men, Mohammed Hamed, 52.</TE>
<TE>   Not far away that same day at the camp clinic, said Awad, the
emergency worker, Israeli soldiers entered the facility, hit and slapped
several people, including himself, and told them to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "They said: 'You'll take out explosives in your ambulances. You're
just treating terrorists,' " Awad said.</TE>
<TE>   Tomei, meanwhile, remained locked in her cousin's house, terrified of
leaving. One day, she said, an elderly woman who was staying with the
family went to the bathroom to wash herself for prayers.</TE>
<TE>   As she came out, a soldier in an apartment across the street heard the
noise of the door opening and fired several shots through it, killing the
old woman.</TE>
<TE>   But the final straw for her, Tomei said, came when she looked out the
window and saw the little girl, who seemed as if she had only just
learned to walk, tottering alone through the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Tomei rushed out and scooped her up despite soldiers' protests. Family
friends now have the child, but Tomei said several people have told her
that the girl's parents were killed during the invasion.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in peace and harmony. I have never hated the Jews," Tomei
said. "But now, they have forced me to hate them."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JIANGYONG, China
</DL>
<LD>Stooped over like a wilted rose, 95-year-old Yang Huanyi hobbles
out of her tiny, spartan home to receive guests who come calling from
around the world.</LD>
<LD>   In her gnarled hands she clutches a rough-hewn notebook. It is the
reason so many foreigners journey to this bucolic corner of southern
China to visit her.</LD>
<LD>   On its pages Yang has written the woeful story of a girl trapped in an
unhappy marriage, a common lot among women in rural China. But the tale
is not what attracts attention. It is how Yang recorded it: in a unique
form of writing invented and passed down through generations by the women
of Jiang-yong--and kept apart from their fathers, husbands and sons.</LD>
<TE>   Long before Western pop psychologists coined the concept of "he said,
she said," the women here were putting it into living, daily practice.
Using their special form of communication--called nushu, or women's
script, in Chinese--they carved out their own private linguistic space in
a world dominated by men.</TE>
<TE>   It was a rare act of female solidarity in one of the world's oldest
civilizations, kept mostly hidden from public view until 20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The language, mainly written but sometimes spoken or sung, enabled its
users to share thoughts, spread gossip and swap experiences at a time
when most of their sex in China were illiterate and often denied
identities apart from their menfolk.</TE>
<TE>   Confined to the home, the women of Jiangyong transformed objects of
daily life into tools of greater intellectual independence. They copied
down their writings in books, embroidered them into handkerchiefs and
painted them onto paper fans.</TE>
<TE>   Their stories are recognizable to women everywhere. Wistful nushu
poems lament over faraway friends, letters complain of nasty husbands and
nastier mothers-in-law, jealous tales attack enemies and rivals.</TE>
<TE>   The women circulated their texts among close companions, "sworn
sisters" who formed small sororities that became crucial female support
networks in the face of male domination.</TE>
<TE>   "Beside a well, one does not thirst," a popular nushu saying holds.
"Beside a sister, one does not despair."</TE>
<TE>   Scholars believe that Yang is the last woman alive who grew up with
nushu as a vital part of her girlhood and adult life, the sole survivor
of a tradition that will die when she does.</TE>
<TE>   Already, her hands are too unsteady to write much. The soul mates who
once deciphered her script, giggled at her jokes, cried at her losses and
then wrote back about their own lives are gone.</TE>
<TE>   And the younger generation, Yang's granddaughters and
great-granddaughters, has no use for nushu. "Nobody's learning it now,"
Yang lamented. "They all go out to work."</TE>
<TE>   A handful of Chinese and Western scholars is working to preserve the
script, as are a few local women and government officials who hope to
exploit its tourist value.</TE>
<TE>   But like Latin, nushu has ceased to function as a living language,
driven to obsolescence by the universality of Mandarin Chinese and the
availability of public education for girls, who see no need for a secret
form of communication as their mothers once did.</TE>
<TE>   "It has no pertinence to anyone's lives anymore," said Cathy L.
Silber, an authority on nushu who teaches at Williams College in
Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   Because the script was never codified, and because of slight
variations from village to village, no precise count exists of the number
of nushu characters invented over the years. Experts put the figure at
between 600 and 1,000. Mandarin Chinese, by contrast, boasts at least
50,000 characters.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike their Mandarin Chinese counterparts, nushu characters do not
represent meanings but sounds. Visually, some nushu writing resembles
Chinese, perhaps because wives and daughters watched their husbands and
brothers learn the dominant language, memorized a few characters and then
modified them for their own use.</TE>
<TE>   But mostly, nushu and Chinese look as different as female and male,
almost literally. Classic Chinese characters are bold and boxy, whereas
nushu characters are wispy, often curvy and written at an elegant slant.
Local residents liken nushu characters to the hieroglyphic-like
scratchings on oracle bones, the earliest evidence of writing discovered
in China.</TE>
<TE>   Through generations, mothers passed on their knowledge of nushu to
their daughters. Grandmothers taught granddaughters while they worked
together at home, spinning, sewing, cooking and singing, segregated from
the men.</TE>
<TE>   "We lived upstairs and didn't even go downstairs, much less go out to
work," Yang recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, elite families hired tutors for their daughters. Female
teachers could thus teach nushu in more formalized settings.</TE>
<TE>   Yang learned alongside a neighbor girl, Gao Yinxian, who eventually
became a prolific nushu author. "I was about 10 years old or so," Yang
said. "I was so happy first learning to sing the songs and then how to
write."</TE>
<TE>Men Just Didn't Listen</TE>
<TE>   The separation of the sexes meant that men took little notice of
nushu, which stayed entirely in the female sphere. If men had listened
closely, they might have been able to understand the language in its
spoken form, which sounds similar to the local dialect of Jiangyong, an
obscure county (pop. 240,000) in southern Hunan province.</TE>
<TE>   But primarily, nushu is a written language. Composition followed
certain conventions. Most writings are in verse, usually seven characters
per line, similar to patterns found in Chinese oral literature, such as
opera.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the extant nushu texts, now in the hands of scholars, are
sanchaoshu. These are special cloth booklets that were presented to a
bride by the women in her family. Inside are songs and poems reflecting
sadness at being separated and anger at the custom that forced a married
woman to leave her childhood home for her husband's household. "The
emperor has made the wrong rules," goes a popular refrain in many bridal
books.</TE>
<TE>   Letters served as a grapevine through which news and gossip could make
the rounds. One letter tells the story of a distraught young newlywed
whose husband in an arranged marriage turned out to be physically
disabled. Another spreads word of a tiger attack in the fields.</TE>
<TE>   A few juicy nushu texts drip with insult and sarcasm, angry missives
that chew people out for bad behavior or some other offense, Silber said.</TE>
<TE>   One particularly acid-tongued woman wrote to another: "At least
animals go into heat in season. But you, . . ." What prompted such
venomous gusto is not clear from the letter, although it might be
guessed.</TE>
<TE>   More serious writings broached politics, at least in terms of their
effects on domestic life.</TE>
<TE>   A song from the first half of the 20th century criticizes China's
Nationalist government for conscripting too many sons into the army.
Another describes how Japanese bombers forced residents to flee their
villages and take refuge in the hillside caves around Jiangyong.</TE>
<TE>   The only subject not covered in nushu writings appears to be finances,
said professor Xie Zhimin, a nushu expert at the Central South China
Institute for Nationalities in Hubei province. "My guess is that it's
because women's status was still low and they weren't allowed to be in
charge of money at home," Xie said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the texts show a surprising degree of independent thought,
Silber cautions against viewing them as subversive. True, the women
complained about the emperor's rules on marriage, "which is a political
statement," Silber said, "but it's not 'Let's overthrow the dynasty.' "</TE>
<TE>   The origins of nushu are lost in legend.</TE>
<TE>   Some scholars theorize that the script was created more than 2,000
years ago, one of many tribal languages scattered across China before the
first emperor, Qin Shihuangdi, unified the country in 221 BC and
promulgated Chinese as the national tongue. The script then wound up in
the hands of women as men switched to mastering the official language.</TE>
<TE>   Another, more fanciful theory centers on a precocious girl from
Jiangyong who was plucked from her childhood home to become an imperial
concubine. "But she was so miserable in the palace that she developed
nushu as a code to send letters of woe to the folks back home," Silber
said.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever its source, nushu is known to have existed at least by the
start of the Taiping Rebellion in 1850. A coin from that period recently
was found stamped with nushu characters.</TE>
<TE>   For generations, the women of Jiangyong penned their letters, composed
their poems and communicated among themselves with little outside
intrusion.</TE>
<TE>   At worst, their writings mystified the men around them. One story has
it that a woman picked up in another part of Hunan province during the
1950s or '60s was believed to be a spy after police found nushu texts in
her possession, which they could not decipher.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, nushu was blasted as a
feudalistic leftover.</TE>
<TE>Crackdown on Nushu</TE>
<TE>   "The women who knew nushu, who used to get together to sing [nushu
songs], were seized and protested against and criticized," said Zhou
Shuoyi. "And the materials they had were confiscated and burned."</TE>
<TE>   Zhou, 77, is a retired official of the Jiangyong county cultural
bureau and is widely credited with exciting scholarly interest in nushu.
He came across mention of the language as a child, and in the 1950s
befriended women proficient in the script.</TE>
<TE>   In 1958, he was denounced as a "rightist," partly for his work on
nushu, and sent to toil in the countryside as a farmer. Rehabilitated 20
years later, Zhou set about publicizing nushu to the outside world. By
then, many of the women who knew the script had died; others were, at
first, too afraid of being persecuted to resume writing.</TE>
<TE>   Local officials see the language mostly as a tourist attraction. One
village set up a nushu school, partly to draw tourists, but ran out of
funds to keep it going.</TE>
<TE>   The teacher, Hu Meiyue, is the granddaughter of Gao Yinxian, the nushu
writer. Hu, 40, has tried to pass on what she knows, but even her
daughter shows little interest.</TE>
<TE>   These days, many of the people whom Yang, the 95-year-old nushu
speaker, meets with to discuss the secret script are foreign visitors and
journalists.</TE>
<TE>   Her face is wizened, her hair nearly gone. But beneath crinkled folds,
her eyes twinkle and her mouth curls up in a charming, toothless smile.
She misses the days when she and her four "sworn sisters" shared stories,
away from the prying eyes and ears of men.</TE>
<TE>   "When I learned nushu, it was to meet with friends and sisters to
exchange our thoughts and letters. We wrote what was in our hearts, our
feelings," Yang said.</TE>
<TE>   "But now," she added with a sigh, "there's no use learning it
anymore."</TE>

<HD>DNA Shakes Up Child Support Law</HD>
<DH>Rights: System is challenged by men forced to pay for children who
are not theirs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Advances in DNA testing have liberated convicts from death row and
helped clear up scores of unsolved mysteries, but they have been slower
to release men from obligations to pay child support in cases where the
tests show they are not the biological father.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of resolving some of those cases, DNA has plunged the area of
child support and paternal obligation into complicated new debate over
the law and issues as profound as what it means to be a father.</LD>
<LD>   Bert Riddick's three children cram into one room in his
brother-in-law's house in Carson because Riddick is required by a court
order to pay child support for a girl he has never met and who is not his
own. The result is that Riddick cannot afford to provide for his
biological children.</LD>
<TE>   A similar order sent Dennis Caron to an Ohio jail for 30 days because
he refused to pay child support for a boy who DNA tests showed was not
his own.</TE>
<TE>   And in the case of Carnell Smith of Decatur, Ga., a $120,000
child-support bill for an ex-girlfriend's offspring who did not belong to
him caused Smith to double-check the paternity of his wife's new baby
with another DNA test.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety-nine point nine-nine-nine percent mine," Smith said proudly.</TE>
<TE>   The three men share more than a legal dilemma. They belong to a
loose-knit movement of fathers who are gradually reshaping child-support
laws in state after state so that men who can prove they did not father
children can avoid paying for them.</TE>
<TE>   In doing so, they have raised new issues about the legal system's role
in defining the rights and responsibilities of those men who are deemed
fathers by the courts, only to have those rulings later challenged by new
scientific evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Roderick Wright (D-Los Angeles), author of a paternity
reform bill slated to be heard by the Assembly Judiciary Committee on
Tuesday, said payments sometimes take a hefty chunk of a man's earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "It ain't his baby and we know it ain't his baby and here we're
hitting him for 60% of his salary," Wright said. "In any other area of
law, if that happened, that would be fraud. We'd be going out and
screaming bloody murder."</TE>
<TE>   But while Wright highlights the injustice of forcing men to pay
support for children who are not their own, some child-support advocates
see a different danger. They say Wright's bill and similar ones in a
dozen other states can harm children by letting men who have acted as
fathers for years escape their obligations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of those things where the science has given us the ability
to do something we maybe shouldn't do," said Paula Roberts of the Center
for Law and Social Policy in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "What you're saying is that all a man is, in terms of a father to a
child, is a sperm donor. . . . We think that's really bad social policy."</TE>
<TE>   The dilemma is created by legal tradition that holds that once a court
has ruled that a man is the father of the child, the judgment must stand.
If the man does not protest quickly enough, his only recourse is to pay
support until the child turns 18.</TE>
<TE>   The number of men affected could be large, especially because
child-support orders are often entered without the man appearing in
court.</TE>
<TE>   Wright cites statistics from a 1999 study by the American Assn. of
Blood Banks. That study found that of 280,000 blood tests performed to
determine the paternity of children, 30% excluded the subject tested as
being the father.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, courts can order children to submit blood or tissue
samples for DNA testing, but rules regarding when and how those tests may
be used vary from state to state.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a clash between jurisprudence concepts rooted in English
common law of a judgment being inviolate, versus 21st century science
that has shown, well, sometimes we were wrong," said Steven Eldred, a
deputy district attorney in Fresno County's child-support office. "This
is a hot issue. Every state is going to have to deal with this."</TE>
<TE>   Several already have. Eight states have passed laws allowing men armed
with DNA evidence to challenge paternity judgments. Legislation is making
its way through at least four others, including California. Ohio's law
passed its Legislature two years ago with only one dissenting vote.</TE>
<TE>   "People just said, 'Hey, gee, this is common sense,' " said Caron, a
45-year-old corporate recruiter who lives outside of Columbus and lobbied
for the bill. "Why should some guy get the shaft like this when he isn't
the father?"</TE>
<TE>   After a protracted divorce and custody battle, Caron in 1997 found
through DNA testing that he was not the child's father. After testifying
before the Ohio Legislature about the need for paternity reform, Caron
was sentenced to 30 days in jail for refusing to pay child support. He
was released when his ex-wife's new husband adopted the child.</TE>
<TE>Congressmen Referred Constituents for Help</TE>
<TE>   The experience made him a child-support celebrity, and calls began
coming in from desperate men. Caron says some congressmen have referred
constituents to him for help. Caron's experience in Ohio gave Carnell
Smith hope.</TE>
<TE>   The 41-year-old engineer read about Caron on the Internet after
becoming embroiled in his own child-support battle. For years, Smith
said, he helped raise the daughter of a former girlfriend who had told
him the child was his. But parishioners at his church advised him to
demand a DNA test after the woman pressed him for child support.</TE>
<TE>   In April 2000, Smith said, he was excluded as the father by a DNA
test. But the judge ordered him to pay anyway. It was then that he took
to the Internet, reasoning that there must be other men in his situation.
He found Caron and obtained a copy of Ohio's legislation, which he
carried to the home of his assemblyman in Decatur.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia's law passed both houses of the Legislature earlier this year,
and the two bodies are working to reconcile technical issues. Smith,
meanwhile, has started an online group to spread what he calls
"anti-paternity fraud" statutes across the country.</TE>
<TE>   "I've declared war on this issue," said Smith, estimating that he has
spoken to nearly 1,000 people. "I want to make sure my son doesn't face
this same system."</TE>
<TE>   Both Smith and Caron had acted as the children's fathers before
discovering that they had no biological connection and refusing to pay
child support. That troubles many critics of the new statutes. They argue
that being a father is more about acting as one than producing a genetic
match.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot have guys who functioned as some kid's father for 12 years
going in and saying, because of some test, all right, I'm off the hook,"
said attorney Jenny Skoble, director of the child-support project at the
Harriet Buhai Center for Family Law in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, for the guy who's acted as the father of a child for 12 years
who finds out that he's not the dad, it's a drag to have to pay the child
support. But it's more of a drag for the child to lose the only father he
or she has ever known," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said child-support advocates like Skoble miss the point.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the problem has already happened, it's like throwing a cluster
bomb in the room--everybody's going to be hurt," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But two people are walking away with no responsibility at all--the
biological mother and the biological father. They had their fun, now they
walk away."</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 2000, the Conference of Commissioners on Uniform
State Laws, a nonprofit group that proposes legislation to be adopted by
states, wrestled with the question of whether men who are not biological
fathers should pay child support.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, of the Center for Law and Social Policy, said the group
agonized over the issue. It ultimately concluded that after a child's
second birthday, the harm of losing a father would outweigh the harm of a
man paying to support a child who was not his own.</TE>
<TE>   "We concluded there was always going to be a set of cases where, no
matter how you came down, you were going to feel badly," Roberts said.
"But if your focus was on the child, at the end of the day you decided
the adults in this relationship are just going to have to suck it up."</TE>
<TE>   Texas and West Virginia adopted laws modeled on the conference's
recommendation, requiring that men have only two years after the birth of
a child to challenge paternity in child-support cases, Roberts said. But
other states, including Ohio, Maryland and Alabama, do not have limits on
when a man can challenge a paternity judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does Wright's bill in California, although it would not allow the
contesting of paternity if the man had previously admitted it in court
while represented by an attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Wright said he tailored his bill to apply to men who never appeared in
court to fight their child support orders--sometimes because they were
not properly served, a common problem in California child support--and
only later discover that they are being billed for a child who is not
their own.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the legislation is written to help men like Bert
Riddick.</TE>
<TE>   Riddick said he was just about to leave on a business trip in 1991
when he found out that an ex-girlfriend had named him as the father of
her newborn child. His then-fiancee had received the summons at their
home and hid it in anger. Riddick went on his trip and missed the
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   When the district attorney's office began to garnish his wages,
Riddick pleaded for relief, but was told there was nothing he could do.</TE>
<TE>   As the bills mounted, Riddick could not support his new, growing
family. His car was repossessed. His new wife went on welfare after
having their second child. They were evicted from the Torrance house they
rented and moved in with the wife's brother. And Riddick began going from
job to job, enjoying a full paycheck for a few weeks before the child
support office found he had new employment and began to garnish his
wages.</TE>
<TE>   After Riddick was featured in a Times series on problems with child
support in Los Angeles, his phone began to ring. He became a fixture on
television news magazine shows and assembled a list of other men in his
circumstance. But he was unable to escape the child-support debt.</TE>
<TE>Learned About Others While Searching Web</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he found out about Caron, Smith and others while searching
the Internet. He contacted Wright, who has backed several fathers' rights
bills. Riddick and two other activists secured a midsummer meeting with a
key Wright aide in a Burbank hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's complicated," Riddick said of the issues. "The women's
rights groups still have this thing where they start the speech with 'the
best interests of the child.' My response to that is, the best interests
of whose child? My children are suffering now."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, of the Center for Law and Social Policy, acknowledged that,
like many DNA cases, Riddick's is a tough one. Still, she said, the fault
is his for missing that hearing 11 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the ultimate Solomon's baby situation," Roberts said. "There
is no way that someone is going to come out not feeling they've been
wronged."</TE>

<HD>Venezuela's Chavez Aims for Healing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela
</DL>
<LD>Free after 48 hours under military arrest, President Hugo Chavez
retook control of Venezuela on Sunday and began anew to place his
personal stamp on the country.</LD>
<LD>   He said he would seek "national reconciliation," but he also held his
chief opponent in custody and hinted at "corrective action" against the
media that supported last week's attempt to oust him.</LD>
<LD>   Chavez appeared to emerge stronger than ever from the conflict with
opposition forces that was led, largely, by disaffected members of the
middle class and the business community. Badly miscalculating the level
of support for Chavez among military officers and the poor, those forces
brought to power an interim president who lasted only a day before Chavez
was returned to this capital early Sunday to resume his post.</LD>
<TE>   The former paratrooper's first address to the Venezuelan people, just
before dawn Sunday, was vintage Chavez. For an hour, he told the story of
his days and nights in captivity, giving the tale tragic and comic turns
and using props like the crucifix he said he had held while praying for
"the safety of my wife and my children."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez also made an important concession to this country's restive
opposition, agreeing to fire the oil officials whose appointment in
February had provoked last week's crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be no retaliation, no revenge," he said. "I didn't come
back to hold a witch hunt."</TE>
<TE>   Later, the president visited the military base where an air force
general had been among the first to declare himself in rebellion against
Pedro Carmona, the hapless interim president who displaced Chavez.
Carmona's ministers fled the Miraflores presidential palace in panic
Saturday night when a large pro-Chavez crowd surrounded the building.</TE>
<TE>   According to Reuters, the Roman Catholic Church said security forces
killed 23 people in riots Saturday night, but there was no official word
on casualties. State television said nine people died.</TE>
<TE>   A mild-mannered leader of the nation's largest business federation,
Carmona was under arrest Sunday, and his family asked the Catholic Church
to help ensure his safety.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, who is in the second year of a six-year term, said in a radio
interview Sunday that Carmona was "being detained but is not being held
incommunicado like I was. . . . He has a right to a defense attorney and
is being investigated by the attorney general to determine the charges
against him."</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Rodriguez Chacin, who serves as both justice and interior
minister, said the military officers who rebelled against Chavez would
also be held to account for "bringing the country to the brink of civil
war."</TE>
<TE>   "Let this [episode] serve as a lesson to us that we should always
maintain the constitutional order," said Rodriguez, who had been arrested
Friday by Carmona's government.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona had earned the wrath of many Latin American leaders Friday
when he took an extraordinary series of measures to undo Chavez's control
of all three branches of government. He dismissed the national
legislature and the Supreme Court, both of which are dominated by Chavez
supporters.</TE>
<TE>   The United States was one of the few countries to suggest that
Chavez's overthrow might have been justified. On Sunday, National
Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" that
Chavez needed to "respect constitutional processes."</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that Hugo Chavez takes the message that his people sent
him--that his own policies are not working for the Venezuelan people,
that he's dealt with them in a highhanded fashion," Rice said.</TE>
<TE>   Once supportive of Chavez's nationalist politics, many middle-class
Venezuelans have grown tired of what they see as his arbitrary style of
rule. They formed a loose coalition to bring him down--including
business, labor, church and civic groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Now Chavez has shown that he can rule without the middle class,"
Anibal Romero, a professor of political science at the University of
Simon Bolivar here, said Sunday. "But he can't make the country
prosperous without them. I'm not sure Chavez has learned that yet."</TE>
<TE>   The rebellion against Chavez failed, Romero said, because of the
"naivete" of its leaders, most of whom have little political experience.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez's surprising return to power brought celebrations in both Cuba
and Iraq. The official Iraqi News Agency released a statement that was
sent Sunday to Chavez from President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "We received with overwhelming and great happiness news of the foiling
of the coup attempt that took place in your country," the message said.
Chavez visited Iraq last year.</TE>
<TE>   In Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, officials issued repeated calls
for calm, as scattered looting and rioting similar to what accompanied
the demonstrations for Chavez's return continued Sunday morning.</TE>
<TE>   The unrest pointed to the underlying tensions in a country where the
majority of people live below the poverty line.</TE>
<TE>   Before Thursday's uprising against him, Chavez had a 34% approval
rating in polls here, having fallen precipitously from 65% in June,
according to pollster Luis Vicente Leon.</TE>
<TE>   A slumping economy and a steep devaluation of the national currency
fed the growing dissatisfaction with Chavez's rule. He slashed the
national budget, a measure prompted in part by his decision to reduce oil
output to keep in line with OPEC quotas.</TE>
<TE>   Leon expects Chavez's popularity to increase somewhat in the short
term, "because he has become a martyr figure to many people." And many
will see his dramatic return to power as proof of his strong leadership,
Leon added.</TE>
<TE>   For some Chavez supporters, the populist strongman's lightning-fast
resurrection from what seemed certain political death has only added to
his mystique as a fighter for Venezuela's downtrodden.</TE>
<TE>   "God gave us this president to look after us, and it's our job to take
care of him," said Milagro Urbaneta, a Caracas resident who had come to
the Miraflores palace to join a celebration of Chavez's return. "He
doesn't think of himself. He thinks of his people first."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez only added to his image with his Sunday morning speech, which
he made as his Cabinet and other followers sat alongside him, addressing
his audience with the easy familiarity of a talk-show host. He recounted
how the generals holding him captive had tried to force him to resign
Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true that they put in front of me a page that said 'Resign.' I
said: 'Put that away. I'm not going to sign it. I am a prisoner
president.' "</TE>
<TE>   Later, as his captors shifted him from one military base to
another--to five different locations in all--he managed to smuggle out a
letter via a loyalist soldier who had asked him: "Is it true, my leader,
that you resigned?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, son, it's not true," Chavez responded.</TE>
<TE>   The soldier gave Chavez paper to write and told him to deliver the
note by crumpling it up and throwing it in a waste basket. The soldier
later retrieved it and smuggled it out to Chavez's supporters, who
offered it as proof that he never resigned.</TE>
<TE>   "I realize now," Chavez concluded, "that it's been too long since I
spent time with the soldiers."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez had harsh words for the Venezuelan media. On Thursday, most of
Venezuela's privately owned television stations offered extensive
coverage of anti-Chavez demonstrations. But Saturday, they ignored the
growing unrest as Chavez supporters took to the streets, and broadcast
regular programming.</TE>
<TE>   "The hour has come for some profound corrective actions" regarding the
media, Chavez said, without offering specifics. Later, a Chavez official
promised an investigation of the television coverage.</TE>

<HD>Immigration Bill Faces a New Holdup</HD>
<DH>Germany: Landmark legislation that would let in a limited number of
skilled foreign workers may get tied up in a constitutional review.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>A landmark immigration law cleared its last legislative hurdle
nearly a month ago, but election-year politics have taken it hostage.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, which would ease the entry of a limited number of skilled
foreigners, finally recognizes Germany as a multicultural society,
supporters say. Detractors say it wantonly throws open the country's
doors to job-stealing foreigners and religious extremists.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation has languished on the desk of President Johannes Rau
since its March 21 approval because opponents have vowed to challenge it
on a procedural technicality.</LD>
<TE>   Rau is expected to sign the bill, perhaps by the end of this month,
after weighing the advice of legal experts. But archconservative
followers of Christian Social Union leader and chancellor candidate
Edmund Stoiber say they will block the bill from becoming law by calling
for what could be a lengthy Constitutional Court review.</TE>
<TE>   Stirring up anti-immigrant sentiments has been a
tried-but-not-always-true campaign tactic in Germany. The Christian
Democratic Union, which is allied with the CSU, soared to victory in
Hesse state in 1999 by bashing government policy toward the 9% of this
country's 82 million people that is non-German.</TE>
<TE>   But the Kinder Statt Inder--"Our Children, Not Indians"--electoral cry
of the party in North Rhine-Westphalia two years ago backfired badly,
leaving the Social Democratic governor firmly in office and painting the
Christian Democrats as opportunistic panderers to racist hostility.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they are winning a lot of credibility with this latest
campaign," said Cem Oezdemir, a Greens Parliament member and naturalized
son of Turkish immigrants. "There is not even unity among the Christian
Democrats on the wisdom of pushing this message."</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives hoping to unseat the Social Democratic governor of
eastern Saxony-Anhalt state in an election Sunday have been warning
voters that the law threatens further job losses; the state is afflicted
with the country's highest unemployment rate at more than 20%. Stoiber
has referred to the state vote--the last before Sept. 22 federal
elections--as a referendum on immigration policy.</TE>
<TE>Bill Would Ensure Visas, While Cutting Red Tape</TE>
<TE>   "When they start such a campaign in a state where foreigners are less
than 2% of the population, they are really playing with fire and they
know it," Oezdemir warned. "It's mathematically impossible for
non-Germans to be responsible for the state's high unemployment."</TE>
<TE>   The immigration bill, as passed by the Bundestag, the lower house of
Parliament, on March 1 and narrowly endorsed by the upper house 35-34,
aims to replace decades of ad hoc practices in deciding work and
residency permits. Skilled immigrants and entrepreneurs willing to bring
their business to Germany would be guaranteed visas and spared much of
the current red tape. The bill also mandates German-language training for
refugees and immigrants who fail a proficiency test--a measure long
sought by all political factions to better integrate those allowed to
move here.</TE>
<TE>   Once signed by Rau--now officially nonpartisan but a longtime Social
Democrat--and sent for Constitutional Court review, the bill, which was
intended to become law Jan. 1, 2003, could be paralyzed for months on the
court's crowded docket. A quick-review option exists for matters deemed
urgent, but with the pressures of a political battle between Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder and Stoiber escalating, many fear that the court, which
is supposed to be above partisan influences, will put off consideration
until after the federal election.</TE>
<TE>   Though Germany suffers more than 10% unemployment, its industrial
chieftains estimate that there is a dearth of high-technology know-how to
the tune of at least 75,000 workers. Most jobless Germans came from the
antiquated heavy industries of eastern Germany and from manufacturing
spheres increasingly driven by robotics. But the nation's network of
trade schools and universities has proven too slow to respond to the new
needs of industry by training more specialists or re-educating laid-off
blue-collar workers for technology jobs.</TE>
<TE>More Jobs Than Resources Can Fill</TE>
<TE>   "People don't always understand that just because we have high
unemployment, that doesn't mean we can fill every job with available
resources," said Barbara John, Berlin's ombudsman for foreigner issues
who departs from her Christian Democratic colleagues in supporting the
immigration law.</TE>
<TE>   "This law will make it possible to bring in those people most needed
to spur economic growth," John said. "What's more, we can finally offer
jobs and residency permits to those foreign students who do study here.
Up to now, we've been training specialists for the U.S. market because
foreign graduates found it easier to move there than stay here."</TE>
<TE>   The government last year introduced a "green card" program, issuing
five-year residency permits to foreigners with the skills employers
couldn't find within the country. Of the 20,000 permits made available,
about 14,000 have been issued, mostly to tech-savvy immigrants from
Eastern Europe, John said.</TE>
<TE>   The immigration bill was the product of years of negotiation among
German politicians, employers, churches and social groups represented on
the federal Independent Commission on Immigration headed by former
Bundestag president and Christian Democrat Rita Suessmuth.</TE>
<TE>   "In the interests of peaceful coexistence we have to do everything
possible to avoid creating an anti-foreigner atmosphere," Suessmuth told
the Berliner Zeitung in a recent interview in which she described
Stoiber's views as "problematic."</TE>
<TE>   More than 70% of young immigrants here have too little command of
German to follow the public school curriculum, which serves to keep them
dependent on social welfare and separated from the cultural mainstream,
said Suessmuth. She added that the bill now in political limbo would not
only reduce state dependence but send a signal to immigrants that Germans
want them to integrate.</TE>

<HD>Sunshine Law Sheds Little Light on Big Bureaucracy</HD>
<DH>Japan: Citizens seeking government documents under new disclosure
measure are disappointed that officials are stymieing them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>After decades of scandals, insider dealings and official arrogance,
Japan last year enacted a national information disclosure law designed to
open bureaucrats' shadowy corridors of power to greater public scrutiny.</LD>
<LD>   A year later, Atsuko Nomura, head of an Osaka group called the Right
to Know Network, is roundly disappointed. Requests for information have
been put off, ignored or answered with a fraction of what her group has
asked for. Bureaucrats are dismissive. And the balance of power is still
very much in favor of petty officials.</LD>
<LD>   "This system just doesn't work properly," Nomura says. "They blocked
us at the door. The central government seems incapable of dealing
directly with its own people, and most of our requests have been flat-out
denied."</LD>
<TE>   Although citizens filed 40,000 disclosure requests in the last year,
according to government statistics, 46% of the responses were incomplete
or nonexistent. Officials face few penalties if they don't comply, and
they often use excuses such as, "We're too busy," "Citizens are asking
too much of us," and "We're not used to these kinds of questions."</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the expense. Under a billing system that would confuse an
Enron accountant, there are application fees, copying charges and
browsing fees, some of which differ depending on whether documents touch
each other in filing cabinets or sit in different drawers. A sizable
search can cost more than $600, and getting it copied onto a CD can cost
several hundred more. Some ministries accept cash; others accept only
coupons sold at post offices. "It's as if they're saying you shouldn't
even think about asking for this," Nomura says.</TE>
<TE>   That said, even tough critics believe that the law in this land of
incremental change is an important first step. The fact that ministry
officials can be challenged by ordinary citizens is starting to make some
rethink for whom they're working.</TE>
<TE>   Yukiko Miki, executive director of the Tokyo-based Information
Clearinghouse Japan, sees it as a long-term battle requiring constant
vigilance and determination. "Bureaucrats act like those gophers in
arcade games," she says from a tiny office stuffed floor to ceiling with
documents. "You hammer down one, and another one pops up."</TE>
<TE>   In the first few weeks after the law was enacted, citizens formed long
lines in front of ministries, prompting at least one agency to erect
tents to handle the overflow. In recent months, requests have dropped off
in part because the backlog has diminished but also because some
taxpayers have become too frustrated to continue their quest.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very, very discouraging," says Masahiro Hirota, assistant
manager of the Osaka tax office, whose request for details on Cabinet
office slush funds was turned down. "They didn't even give a reason when
they said no."</TE>
<TE>   By law, ministries must respond within 30 days to a request. Because
the regulations governing bureaucrats were written by fellow bureaucrats,
however, embarrassing queries can seemingly be put off indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Citizens who feel they're getting the runaround can appeal to a
government review board. But this body lacks much muscle beyond some
vague threat to embarrass those unwilling to yield information. And for
scandal-plagued ministries already battered by public opinion, that
threat doesn't count for much.</TE>
<TE>Disclosure Standards Vary by Agency</TE>
<TE>   Another problem is inconsistent disclosure standards. Some ministries
are forthcoming, helpful and willing to reveal names, while others are
obstreperous. A recent survey by the Tokyo-based Citizens Center for
Information Disclosure ranked the Foreign Ministry--which has been the
subject of a string of payoff, embezzlement and infighting scandals--the
worst. Other laggards were the ever-secretive Imperial Household Agency,
charged with managing the emperor and his family, and the Defense
Ministry. The best marks went to the Environment Ministry, a relatively
weak agency eager for public support to fight its battles with other
government entities.</TE>
<TE>   Critics also complain that bureaucrats hide behind privacy rights,
another murky legal area. And the lack of Internet access and credit card
payment systems also can handicap citizens trying to obtain information
from outside Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Scholars say the law rests on weak pillars. Many important policy
decisions in Japan are still made without writing anything down. This
long-standing practice gives officials enormous discretionary power and
great deniability, says Shohei Muta, senior researcher with the Japan
Center for Asian Historical Records.</TE>
<TE>   Even when decisions are recorded, rules on preserving those records
are very weak, adds Hiroshi Asako, a law professor at Waseda University.
While the U.S. and most European national archive systems have strict
rules designed to preserve documents for posterity, Japanese bureaucrats
are free to destroy most records after five years.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, they can tell you a record doesn't exist, they hide them
or change them to suit their needs," Asako says. "As so often happens in
Japan, those with real power remain hidden."</TE>
<TE>   Akio Fujii, a deputy director general with the Ministry of Public
Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications, disagrees.
Japanese bureaucrats have citizens' best interests in mind and aren't
trying to hide anything, he says. Western countries just have a different
culture about keeping records, he adds. Besides, Japanese officials don't
have as many secretaries, and it would take too much work to save
everything.</TE>
<TE>   "Providing information is important, but when citizens start acting
like prosecutors, it's going too far," Fujii says.</TE>
<TE>   One sea change, however, is the face-to-face contact between the
public and central officials long viewed as the elite, cloistered
guardians of the nation. For those used to pulling the levers of power
from behind the shoji screen, this can be quite disconcerting.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent weekday afternoon on the second floor of Japan's Health
Ministry, a young, well-dressed man was in a standoff with two ministry
officials for over an hour after trying for four months to get his
information request filled. As the debate heated up, he became more
emotional, and the officials grew more stubborn. Both sides looked angry.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't trust these bureaucrats," he said afterward, requesting that
his name not be used. "When they don't want to do something, they just
change the person in charge, avoid responsibility and hide things for
their benefit."</TE>
<TE>   Japan's information disclosure battles started in the 1970s and early
1980s, when a series of health scandals involving Thalidomide, food
additives, hepatitis and AIDS prompted victims to begin seriously
questioning government benevolence.</TE>
<TE>   The first town to pass an ordinance was Kanayama in 1982, followed a
year later by Kanagawa prefecture. By April 2000, all 47 prefectures and
85% of Japan's cities had information disclosure laws in place. This
finally embarrassed the central government into enacting its own law a
year ago, two decades after the issue was first raised in parliament.</TE>
<TE>Media Have Been Wary of New Law</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., the media were a major catalyst for passing so-called
sunshine laws, many of which have been in place for three decades. In
Japan, however, civic groups say the media have been somewhat wary of the
changes, concerned that they may lose the monopoly on government
information that they have enjoyed under Japan's cozy press-club system.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's national law widened the scope of documents eligible for
disclosure after it was discovered that local governments were keeping
parallel filing cabinets--a sanitized version for public consumption, and
a real one for internal use.</TE>
<TE>   That said, activists credit local governments with doing a better job
of coordinating requests and giving consistent answers as well as using a
far simpler and less expensive fee system.</TE>
<TE>   Information Clearinghouse Japan is trying to encourage local
governments to match the best features of the national law, then use
progressive local laws to nudge the central government to improve its law
when the measure comes up for review in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "Bureaucrats will never change by themselves," says Tsunesuke
Kurayama, director general of the Sendai Citizens Ombudsman, a civic
group. "It's essential that we citizens keep our eyes peeled and continue
to make noise."</TE>

<DL>BAGRAM, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>After weeks of no reported combat with Al Qaeda or Taliban
fighters, American-led forces clashed with "terrorists," and several of
the enemy were believed killed, the U.S. command said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   In a separate incident, rockets were fired at a U.S.-controlled
airstrip in southeastern Afghanistan, a stark reminder that the country's
struggle to overcome 23 years of war is far from over.</LD>
<LD>   In the clash Saturday, no casualties were reported among U.S. Special
Forces troops or their Afghan allies. The skirmish erupted after a joint
patrol came under fire, said Army Maj. Bryan Hilferty, U.S. military
spokesman. He said troops called in air support from an AC-130 gunship.
He would not say where the clash took place.</LD>
<TE>   Hilferty said the troops could not confirm the death toll among the
attackers, but he said the patrol believed that it had "killed several
terrorists" because "the AC-130 saw them, fired, and then didn't see them
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The second attack took place outside the eastern city of Khowst, near
the Pakistani border. The region is believed to have pockets of Al Qaeda
and Taliban resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Accounts of what happened varied. A local leader contacted by
satellite phone said unidentified attackers fired three rockets at an
airstrip there around midnight. A building was hit, injuring three
Afghans, according to Fazal Mir.</TE>
<TE>   However, Tribal Affairs Minister Amunalah Zadran said that two
missiles exploded about four miles from the airport and that no one was
hurt.</TE>
<TE>   No American troops were at the base at the time, U.S. officials said.</TE>

<HD>When No Place Is Really Home</HD>
<DH>Migration: Ethnic Russian is seen as a foreigner in Kabul, as are
her half-Afghan children. But Moscow refuses to claim her.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>In the dank stairwell of apartment block 2 in the suburban Kabul
neighborhood of Blakhay Qasaba Kargari, you are transported a world away:
This soulless concrete box could be in Moscow, or any other Russian city.</LD>
<LD>   Eight flights up, a Russian woman named Galina Margoyeva, 35, yearns
for just such a place. Anywhere in Russia.</LD>
<LD>   She came more than 14 years ago from the Soviet Union, when its war to
occupy Afghanistan was coming to its failed conclusion. She was trapped
here, survived war and outlasted the Taliban, only to be told that Russia
would not claim her, and that she was a citizen of nowhere.</LD>
<TE>   Her children are treated as enemies. And her family's spartan two-room
apartment has been like a prison where she hid Russian fairy tales and
classics like "Anna Karenina" under the stove during the Taliban era.</TE>
<TE>   Her ability to speak Russian is beginning to trickle away, with Dari
seeping into her dreams, drowning out her mother tongue.</TE>
<TE>   All this is the price of her love for an Afghan man.</TE>
<TE>   An ethnic Russian born in Tajikistan, a Soviet republic bordering
Afghanistan that is now an independent country, she married Haji Hussein
in the mid-1980s, and the couple planned a life in the Soviet Union. But
he had to return to Afghanistan after completing his studies, and when he
could not go back to the Soviet Union, she joined him in Kabul, the
Afghan capital, in 1987. Tears flooded her eyes when the pilot announced
that the plane had left Soviet airspace. The same day, Islamic guerrillas
unleashed a fierce rocket attack on Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Still stranded in an alien land years later, Margoyeva is afraid to go
far from her apartment. She knows a handful of people, has few friends
and is spooked by rumors of violence against women who go out without
burkas, the garment women wear to cover their faces and bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Her life reflects the fears, antipathies and suspicions common in
Afghanistan, a country she has never liked enough to call home.</TE>
<TE>   Her world is the apartment block, and after years of being cooped up,
she resents and even despises some of her neighbors. Some of them, she
says, leave piles of rubbish at her door and taunt her four children as
shuravi, as the Soviets, who occupied the country for a decade, were
called.</TE>
<TE>   With children who speak little Russian and an Afghan husband,
Margoyeva might find her dreams of a radiant homecoming to Russia
disappointed. Russia too is a country suspicious of outsiders,
particularly people from southern regions and republics.</TE>
<TE>   Last October, 250 neo-Nazi skinheads targeted Afghans and other
foreigners at the Sevastopol Hotel in Moscow and a nearby market. In the
riot, a 40-year-old Afghan refugee was beaten and then hospitalized in a
coma. Three people were killed: a Tajik, an Indian and an Armenian.
Despite such violence, Margoyeva is convinced that her family would be
better off in Russia, and her husband has always wanted to live there
too.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Russian children are like Afghan children. Afghan
children are envious and cruel," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her two sons, Farid, 15, and Khomed, 8, look Russian like their
mother, but her husband gave them Afghan names. Daughters Lina, 12, and
Marina, 11, look more Afghan but have Russian names.</TE>
<TE>   Margoyeva met her husband, who is now 41, in Tajikistan, where he was
training as a building engineer. Forced to return to Afghanistan when his
studies ended, he was drafted by the pro-Soviet government into the
military and his term was extended for several years.</TE>
<TE>   He fought the anti-Soviet moujahedeen. He despises them and the
Taliban equally.</TE>
<TE>   The family's efforts to return to the Soviet Union were frustrated
first by lack of money, then by the closure of the embassy after the
Soviet army withdrew in 1989, and by the expiration of Margoyeva's Soviet
passport.</TE>
<TE>   "The most difficult day was the day when we saw the last Soviet plane
leave, and with that our last hope died," said Margoyeva, who lives close
to Kabul's main airport--a prime target in the civil war that raged after
the retreat of the Russians.</TE>
<TE>Airport Always a Target</TE>
<TE>   Whether it was fighting among moujahedeen factions in the early 1990s,
or the Taliban pushing toward Kabul in the mid-1990s, the airport was
always a strategic target.</TE>
<TE>   "The moujahedeen were like terrorists. They used to come here at night
and kill people. Everyone was afraid of them," Margoyeva said, describing
how a neighbor was dragged away in the early 1990s. Her family was afraid
someone would denounce her as a Russian and an enemy.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'd know what it was going to be like, I would never have come.
Who wants to live in a slaughterhouse? Every day you worry, every day bad
news. No freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in prison for 14 years. It goes on and on, even today."</TE>
<TE>   Life under the Taliban was particularly severe, but even now she feels
repressed. She has nothing to do but sweep the floors and wash the dishes
and clothes. She used to spend the days reading Russian stories to the
children, but they are now in school.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't hold your husband's hand in the street or they're
immediately pointing the finger at you," she said. "My nerves are on edge
when someone insults me or shouts 'Shuravi!' at my children. I just stare
at them, speechless. I immediately start trembling, and I begin to cry."</TE>
<TE>   In late March, the family bought a television, set up a satellite dish
and was able to pick up Russian television for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "Bravo!" shouted Margoyeva, who had not seen Russian programs for 10
years.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband recently set up a building firm and won a contract with a
Western agency in Afghanistan. But when the Russian Embassy opened at the
end of December, she hurried there in hopes of getting a passport that
would allow them to leave. However, she was told that she had lost her
citizenship, and that she was stateless.</TE>
<TE>   In a typically Russian bureaucratic twist, she was told to become an
Afghan citizen before she could apply to be a Russian.</TE>
<TE>   "I was amazed. I said, 'I don't want to be an Afghan citizen. I have
been living with this horror for 14 years waiting for the Russian Embassy
to reopen so that I can leave this place. Now that you're here, you're
telling me I should become an Afghan?' "</TE>
<TE>   She insisted on applying for Russian citizenship, and was allowed to
fill out a passport application, which has been sent to Moscow for a
decision.</TE>
<TE>   As an ethnic Russian born in Tajikistan, her case is in some ways
similar to those of millions of Russians left in other republics outside
of Russia when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Many of them, like
Margoyeva, from Central Asian republics, moved to Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Russian Embassy officials in Kabul say her problem was her family's
desire to move to Russia. They said they had no problem issuing a
passport to another Russian woman married to an Afghan who planned to
stay in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Unthinkable in most Afghan homes, Margoyeva meets male guests with her
face uncovered. Her willingness to correct her husband and her failure to
leap to her feet to make him tea when he walks in the door would seem to
be proof here of a lack of love, not a sign of equality. Yet Margoyeva
says her deep love of her husband is what has seen her through.</TE>
<TE>Burka 'Was Unbearable'</TE>
<TE>   Like most Afghan women, she rarely ventured outside while the Taliban
was in power. She put off going out in a burka, which is called a chaderi
in the Dari language, until a family wedding, when there was no choice.
She got one from a neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   "The chaderi is a real horror. It's heavy. It pulls your head back,
and you have this net in front of your eyes so you get a lot of
headaches. In the summer it was unbearable," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I put it on, I found the whole thing degrading. It was
like putting a sack on your head. It's as if a woman is not even a
person.</TE>
<TE>   "I told my husband, 'I don't even know how I could get out of the
apartment and reach the car,' " she said. He comforted her, and they even
laughed together over her initial clumsiness in the burka.</TE>
<TE>   The hated garment is now stuffed away in a cupboard, never to be worn
again. Instead, she dons a head scarf to go out. But she is waiting for
the day when she can go where she likes and wear what she likes.</TE>
<TE>   As a student, Margoyeva studied the piano. She loves Rachmaninoff, and
struggles to remember the piece she studied for an exam long ago. There
is no piano in the apartment except for a small child's toy, with a dozen
plastic keys. Alone at home, she sometimes would let her fingers wander
over the keyboard, trying to recapture memories.</TE>
<TE>   "I had this small toy piano that I sometimes played," she said,
pulling out the tinny little instrument with a wistful smile. "When I
played, I had this sad, sad feeling that I'd come here and couldn't go
back."</TE>

<HD>Oil Prices Likely to Spike Upward Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>Oil prices are expected to rise today amid the confusing turn of
events in Venezuela that have returned Hugo Chavez to power and clouded
the future of a nation that is the world's fourth-largest exporter of
oil.</LD>
<LD>   Oil prices rose sharply last week as Venezuelan labor unrest spread.
Then they fell back just as sharply on Friday when Chavez was driven from
power as traders bet that a new regime would bring stability and possibly
even raise oil production above levels observed by Chavez.</LD>
<LD>   Today's oil trading, now that Chavez has returned to power after two
days under arrest, could be just as volatile--and could remain so until
the Venezuelan political scene stabilizes. Venezuela is the third-largest
U.S. source of petroleum and refined products.</LD>
<TE>   "I think the market's going to go berserk," said Michael Lynch, chief
energy economist at DRI-WEFA, an energy consulting firm based in
Lexington, Mass. He said prices could rise by $1 a barrel. On Friday,
crude oil for May delivery fell to $23.47 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "The concern is this is still all in process, that there may be a
counter counterrevolution."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Rothman, energy analyst at Merrill Lynch, agreed that the events
will affect trading. "There will be a knee-jerk reaction; whether it's
massive or minuscule remains to be seen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In his first day back in office on Sunday, Chavez made conciliatory
moves toward the workers at Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, the
state-owned oil company where labor unrest last week prompted a general
strike, galvanized citizen discontent and helped drive him from power.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez accepted the resignations Sunday of PDVSA President Gaston
Parra and the entire board of directors, which Chavez had stacked with
cronies in February. Those appointments, combined with firings of top
PDVSA executives in recent weeks, helped trigger the strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez on Sunday also was said to be preparing to name Bernardo
Alvarez, now vice minister of mines and energy, as new PDVSA president.
Alvarez is generally well-perceived in the PDVSA ranks, sources said. A
general meeting of employees has been set for today.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the conciliatory gestures, analysts expect the political
situation to remain uncertain, with continued labor strife and violence
possible if Chavez fails to achieve reconciliation of opposing factions
whose street clashes left a dozen or more people dead last week.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez also might take a sterner hand in dealing with the oil company
now that the failed coup has revealed his opponents' lack of will, said
one Caracas oil industry analyst, who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   "We might have a few more weeks of uncertainty, people worrying that
the company will go back on strike and production will go down again,"
said Lynch of DRI-WEFA.</TE>
<TE>   PDVSA output has been eroding over the last several months, due to
Chavez's custom of bleeding it dry of cash reserves that in past years
had been spent on maintenance and on new drilling, Lynch said. A work
slowdown called Operation Turtle also has hurt production.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuelan officials said Friday that crude oil production had fallen
from 2.5 million barrels a day to 1.4 million barrels. Lynch estimated
that PDVSA's current capacity--that is, its maximum output level--has
shrunk by 1 million barrels a day to 2.5 million over the last six months
because of reduced investment.</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons that prices fell on Friday is that market traders
expected that a new president would abandon Chavez's strict adherence to
production quotas set by OPEC, to which it belongs, and instead resume
what Lynch described as Venezuela's "old cheating ways."</TE>

<HD>Attempt on Colombian Candidate Hits Others</HD>
<DH>South America: Bomb misses presidential race leader, but kills
four.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>A bus exploded as the motorcade of Colombia's leading presidential
candidate drove by Sunday, leaving him unharmed but killing at least four
people and injuring several others, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Alvaro Uribe Velez's caravan was pulling out of a campaign stop at a
public market in the Caribbean coastal city of Barranquilla when the
parked bus exploded. Uribe, a hard-liner running on pledges to crack down
on leftist guerrillas, appeared on local radio and television moments
later to say he was unharmed.</LD>
<LD>   "What happened is lamentable. I hope that the wounds that my
colleagues suffered are not serious," Uribe said.</LD>
<TE>   Gen. Armando Sandoval, police chief in Atlantico state, said four
bystanders had died in the blast but that their identities were still
unknown. He said three police officers were wounded. Uribe aides said the
injured people were motorcycle escorts.</TE>
<TE>   "Attributing blame at this moment would be speculation," Sandoval told
local RCN radio.</TE>
<TE>   Suspicion in the attack was likely to fall on the main rebel group,
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe, a former governor, holds a commanding lead ahead of May 26
presidential elections--in large part because his tough rhetoric against
the FARC has resonated with fed up Colombians.</TE>
<TE>   Rebel attacks have been escalating since peace talks collapsed in
February with President Andres Pastrana's government.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's 38-year war pits the FARC and another guerrilla faction
against Colombia's military and a right-wing paramilitary group. About
3,500 people have died annually, most civilians.</TE>

<HD>India's Ruling Alliance Holds Despite Discord</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI
</DL>
<LD>India's shaky ruling coalition survived a revolt Sunday over its
handling of the worst religious violence in a decade, winning at least a
reprieve.</LD>
<LD>   The Telugu Desam Party, or TDP, the second largest in the alliance,
did not walk out despite its anger at the way the coalition leader, the
Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, has handled complaints over Hindu-Muslim
bloodshed in Gujarat state.</LD>
<LD>   But the TDP stopped short of declaring wholehearted support for the
alliance, saying it did not discuss withdrawing from the coalition during
a strategy meeting that lasted more than five hours Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   The coalition earlier had appealed to the TDP not to quit over the
explosion of Hindu-Muslim violence in Gujarat, saying it was committed to
a secular agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Telugu Desam and other coalition members have demanded that the BJP
sack its Gujarat chief minister, Narendra Modi, for failing to prevent
the bloodshed, in which more than 800 people died, and are furious that
it instead protected him and ordered an early state election.</TE>
<TE>   That decision provoked protest from rivals and allies, who said it was
a cynical exercise to win votes in Gujarat by cashing in on simmering
Hindu anger there.</TE>

<HD>Jetliner Crashes in S. Korea</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Beijing-to-Pusan flight with 166 aboard goes down in
heavy fog. At least 44 people may have survived.</DH>

<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>An Air China passenger plane on its way to the South Korean city of
Pusan crashed into a mountainside this morning while approaching an
airport heavily shrouded in fog.</LD>
<LD>   There were 155 passengers and 11 crew members aboard. Fourty-seven
people were removed from the wreckage and taken to Pusan-area hospitals,
Yoon Sun Jung of the Home Affairs Ministry told the Reuters news agency.
He said 44 of the 47 were alive.</LD>
<LD>   Sixteen of the passengers worked for the same South Korean fire
insurance firm and were returning from a company-paid vacation.</LD>
<TE>   The Boeing 767 from Beijing went down at about 11:45 a.m. Earlier in
the morning, poor visibility around Pusan and other cities in the
southern part of the Korean peninsula had forced cancellation of nearly
40 flights.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot of the Air China plane apparently was trying to turn back
and crashed into the mountainside while attempting a U-turn.</TE>
<TE>   "Just before the crash, the pilot broadcast, 'We will land at Kimhae
Airport in a few minutes.' Then the plane started shaking and filled with
smoke," a survivor identified as Kim Moon Hak told South Korean
television.</TE>
<TE>   Poor weather was suspected as the cause of the crash, although some
witnesses reported that the plane started to burn before it hit the
ground, which would imply either engine malfunction or sabotage.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a flame from the tail part of the plane before it crashed,"
said a witness who was quoted on South Korea's KBS News.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little dizzy. I was leaning down to the floor of the plane.
There was a big shock. I don't know what happened next," said another
survivor, Kang Man Se, a woman in her 50s, who was quoted from her
hospital bed by South Korean cable news channel YTN.</TE>
<TE>   The mountain that Flight CA-129 crashed into is just outside the Pusan
airport, and the plane narrowly missing an apartment complex. South
Korean television showed footage of the aircraft broken in half and in
flames.</TE>
<TE>   Kim, the survivor, managed to stagger away from the wreckage to a
police call box and report the crash. He said there were other survivors.</TE>
<TE>   Pusan is South Korea's second-largest city, 200 miles southeast of
Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   The passengers were mostly South Koreans on their way home from
vacation in China. Witnesses said rescue workers were having difficulty
reaching possible survivors because of the burning wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   "It's on top of a mountain. There is a black cloud of smoke, which
makes it dangerous for rescuers to approach the aircraft," a television
journalist reported from the scene. Television news showed dramatic
footage of rescuers making their way through a forest burning from the
wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   The South Korean Ministry of Construction and Transportation set up an
emergency committee to investigate the accident.</TE>
<TE>   Air China is China's flag bearer and its largest airline in terms of
traffic volume, according to the airline's Web site. Air China has not
had a fatal crash since it was founded in 1988, according to the aviation
safety Web site Airsafe.Com.</TE>

<DL>KATMANDU, Nepal
</DL>
<LD>At least 17 Maoist rebels were killed in a new clash with soldiers
after last week's assault on two security posts in which more than 300
people are believed to have died, state radio said today.</LD>
<LD>   Radio Nepal said soldiers recovered weapons and bombs after the gun
battle late Sunday in Murkatti, near Dang in western Nepal, where last
week's rebel attacks took place.</LD>
<LD>   King Gyanendra earlier Sunday appealed for an end to the increasingly
deadly battle to topple him.</LD>
<TE>   All Nepalese must "unite in widening the base of mutual confidence and
understanding through democratic exercise," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nepal is under emergency rule as Gyanendra and his government try to
crush Maoist rebels who control about a quarter of the country and are
seeking to create a one-party communist state.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities fear that more than 300 people were killed last week in
two of the bloodiest attacks of the six-year rebellion, including dozens
of police officers who were forced to strip before being executed.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 bodies have been recovered.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Although both sides declared victory in a ruling on their border
dispute, jubilation in Ethiopia and a muted mood in Eritrea hinted that
the most prized turf may have gone to Ethiopia.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by neutral experts, published on a U.N. Web site, gives
Eritrea large territorial awards in the border's western sector but hands
Ethiopia symbolically important, high-profile towns.</LD>
<LD>   The award to Ethiopia of Badme village, where the 1998-2000 war
started, may be a political triumph for Addis Ababa. But once the highly
technical ruling is studied, it may be found to have handed Eritrea more
land, diplomats said.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two survivors of last week's deadly gas truck explosion at a
2,000-year-old Tunisian synagogue told a newspaper that they believe the
attack was deliberate.</LD>
<LD>   Helmut Eckart, 59, told Germany's Bild am Sonntag newspaper that the
truck was outside the synagogue on the island of Djerba when he and other
tourists arrived. Tunisian authorities have said the tanker bumped into a
synagogue wall while turning around and then exploded.</LD>
<LD>   "That can't be. It was there all the time," Eckart said. "It struck me
as odd: A man got out, closed the doors. Then, he went away quickly
toward the town."</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, three more Germans died Sunday from their injuries,
bringing the blast death toll to 16.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NABLUS, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>On their seventh day entombed in a home that had been crushed by an
Israeli bulldozer, Abdullah Shobi's wife turned to him and said: "I think
today is our last day. We are going to die." Shobi, 68, a retired baker,
nodded in agreement.</LD>
<LD>   He called out again for help.</LD>
<LD>   "I am Abdullah Mohammed Ahmed Shobi. Save us!"</LD>
<TE>   The words bounced off the rubble that had turned their bedroom into a
dark, sealed cave. No reply came back. Dehydrated, dazed, their food and
water gone, Shobi and his wife, Shamsa, said a prayer. They had no words
left.</TE>
<TE>   The Shobis lived in a three-story home near the old quarter of Nablus,
the largest West Bank city. The house was a family compound, filled with
uncles and aunts, nephews and a niece who was seven months pregnant.
There were 10 of them in all--three generations of one family--and from
their roof they could see the minarets that stretched across the skyline
and many of the soap factories that had made Nablus a bustling commercial
center.</TE>
<TE>   But Nablus also has been a hotbed of anti-Israeli activism and, Israel
says, a haven for terrorists. On March 29, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
sent his tanks into the West Bank in response to a spate of suicide
bombings that were claiming the lives of Israeli civilians by the dozens.
The mission was designed to cut off the terrorist network at its neck.</TE>
<TE>   Of the hundreds of targets that military planners listed, one was the
Shobis' home. According to Israel, it was used to make explosives for
suicide attacks. There is no way for independent observers to know
whether Israel's intelligence was correct. The Shobis say that it was
not, that they were an ordinary family uninvolved with political or
military matters.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting marked the Israelis' entry into Nablus, and the destruction
wrought by Israeli tanks around the old quarter was stunning. An Israeli
bulldozer equipped with a backhoe rumbled down the Shobis' street. It
stopped at their compound, raised its blade and began to bash in the
third floor.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian witnesses said the top floor fell into the second floor,
killing eight occupants--including the Shobis' pregnant niece--in an
avalanche of brick and mortar and ceiling beams. Then the second floor
fell into the ground floor, where Shobi and his wife had their bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   The roar of the bulldozer's engine drowned out Shobi's call for
help--"We are people here!"--as it pushed rubble 6 feet high against the
front door, sealing off the home with no rear exit and no side windows.
So that is where, cowering on their bed, the couple were trapped April 5,
in utter darkness, with one bottle of water and two pieces of bread, the
air so thick with dust and debris that each breath ripped at the lungs.</TE>
<TE>   Severe thirst set in. Hunger pains came and went. Bruises darkened.
Seven days passed. Then something miraculous happened. Moments after the
old man and his wife had raised their right forefingers toward heaven and
said together, "I testify that there is no god but God. I testify that
Muhammad is the prophet of God," they heard the faint crunching of
shovels above them.</TE>
<TE>   There were 14 men there, led by the Nablus fire chief, Yusef Jabi, who
had heard rumors that someone might still be alive in the house but
didn't quite believe them. He had negotiated with the Israelis for two
days over the phone asking permission to look for survivors. The
Israelis, he said Sunday, had refused.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided to take on the job at our own risk," Jabi said.</TE>
<TE>   At first, when the fire brigade broke curfew and started digging at
the Shobis' home Friday afternoon, Israeli soldiers fired into the air to
discourage the rescuers. Then they relented and let the group proceed.
Soon the rescuers heard a weak voice: "I am Abdullah Mohammed Ahmed
Shobi!"</TE>
<TE>   Jabi shook his head in disbelief.</TE>
<TE>   Jabi's men chiseled a hole in the collapsed roof. They lowered ropes.
Shobi tied them around his waist and was pulled to freedom. Ninety
minutes later, after the firemen cut a bigger hole, his 250-pound wife
emerged.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing the clear light and tasting the fresh air of a spring dusk,
Shobi said, "This is like being dead and getting reborn."</TE>
<TE>   Shobi and his wife recounted their ordeal Sunday in Watani Hospital,
where doctors said it was a miracle that they had survived. The Shobis
agreed. They were being treated for dehydration and bruises and were
expected to be released in a few days.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the hospital, with the Israeli-enforced curfew still in
effect, Nablus appeared as lifeless as a graveyard. Laundry flapped on
balconies, but not a soul was in sight, not a shop was open, not a dog
lounged on the sidewalks. It was as though the city's 125,000 residents
had all disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Shobi said no, he really didn't know what he would do or where he
would live next.</TE>

<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>The Israeli military said it has arrested a top militant, the
leader of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade in the northern part of the West
Bank, a week after he was reported killed in an explosion in a refugee
camp.</LD>
<LD>   Nasser Awais, 32, was arrested in the village of Tubas, the military
announced Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Awais was reported killed April 5 when an explosives belt he was
wearing--equipment of a suicide bomber--exploded prematurely during
fighting with Israeli troops in the northern city of Nablus. The news of
his death came from a spokesman for the Al Aqsa group, which is linked to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement.</LD>
<TE>   After Awais' reported arrest, an Al Aqsa source said Awais had
survived the fighting in Nablus. The militia's leaders told the media
that Awais had died because they thought that Awais was the target of the
Israeli invasion in Nablus and that the incursion might stop if Israel
thought he was dead, said the source, who declined to give his name.</TE>
<TE>   Awais would be one of the highest-ranking militants captured during
the Israeli offensive in the West Bank, which began March 29 in response
to a series of bloody Palestinian suicide bomb attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Awais lived in the Balata refugee camp next to Nablus and controlled
the powerful armed faction which took responsibility for many attacks
against Israelis.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>The Palestinians and foreign peace activists trapped inside Yasser
Arafat's headquarters here got a bit of a reprieve over the weekend.
After two weeks without water or phones, with limited electricity and
serious food shortages, a visit by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell on
Sunday brought them some relief--at least temporarily.</LD>
<LD>   The Israelis who surround the compound turned on the water Saturday,
and many of the Palestinian officials, members of security forces and 40
activists inside had their first wash since the siege began more than two
weeks ago. Toilets were flushed. Lights went on. The stench reported by
earlier delegations dissipated.</LD>
<LD>   The adjacent parking lot and grounds had been littered with debris and
cars crushed by lumbering Israeli Merkava tanks when troops took over
this West Bank city, whose name means "God's mountain." But the area was
cleaned up by the Israeli troops who ring the three-story white limestone
building, according to U.S. officials who visited the compound in
preparation for Powell's visit.</LD>
<TE>   But the compound, with a gaping hole in one wall and bullet holes
everywhere, is still a forlorn place. Conditions there are desperate, and
the inhabitants are enraged about the Israeli siege.</TE>
<TE>   Two Palestinians--a bodyguard for the Palestinian Authority president
and an intelligence official--have been killed in gun battles around the
compound in the last two weeks, and a dozen people have been injured. Two
are in serious condition, and medical supplies have almost run out,
according to Dr. Zeid abu Shawish, deputy health minister of the
Palestinian Authority. He said he had performed major surgery with only a
local anesthetic.</TE>
<TE>   "Some days we eat one meal, some days two," said Ali Sawaftah, a
Palestinian journalist inside the compound. "We sleep in shifts on the
floor or a few mattresses."</TE>
<TE>   For sustenance, the Palestinians and activists have relied on the
International Committee of the Red Cross, which periodically brings food
and drinking water. A few days ago, the Norwegian ambassador brought a
chocolate cake, which the Palestinians saved and served to the Powell
delegation Sunday along with coffee--although there was no milk.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat is reported by those inside to be in good spirits, but he
appeared pale and thinner than usual when he met with Powell for three
hours Sunday. As the members of Powell's media entourage waited for the
secretary to come out and make a statement, three Palestinian journalists
who had been trapped inside joined them--mainly to stand in the spring
sunlight, they said. For 17 days, the compound's windows have been sealed
because of fear of Israeli snipers, and this was the Palestinian
journalists' first outing in the sun.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat--who was known as Abu Ammar, or "father of war," during his
time as a Palestine Liberation Organization guerrilla leader--is said to
frequently make the rounds of his staff and the activists to find out how
they are faring or remind them to stay away from the windows.
Occasionally, he cracks a light joke or two, according to Mohammed
Mesharqa, a Palestinian journalist with the newspaper Al Ayam who has
been wiling away the hours recording events in his diary, writing poetry
or watching CNN when the electricity is on.</TE>
<TE>   One of the angriest people inside the compound is the only Israeli.
Neta Golan, a 30-year-old therapist and activist, burst into the room in
which Arafat and Powell were meeting to rail against U.S. policy.</TE>
<TE>   "When hundreds are dying or being massacred in the West Bank, Powell
meets with [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon and calls him a friend,"
she told reporters. "But when six Israelis are killed in a suicide
bombing, Powell will postpone meeting Arafat. Arab blood is cheap. As a
Jew, I cannot accept that the world remains quiet."</TE>
<TE>   The situation is leading to the "Talibanization" of the Palestinian
street, Golan warned, referring to the fundamentalist regime that ruled
Afghanistan until last year.</TE>
<TE>   The reprieve from the siege didn't last long. The phones that went on
shortly before Powell arrived shut off just after he left, according to
Saeb Erekat, Arafat's senior advisor and a mediator with the U.S. team.
And the water that was turned on Saturday was knocked out when an Israeli
vehicle ran over the pipe Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   When Powell arrived, the pipe was leaking on the ground outside--and
there was again no water within.</TE>

<LD>Applications to the Appalachian School of Law in Grundy have
increased dramatically in the three months since a gunman killed the
dean, a professor and a student on campus.</LD>
<LD>   As of April 6, the school had received 587 applications for the coming
academic year. At the same time one year ago, 387 people had applied. The
school expects to have an incoming class of 125 in the fall. That will
boost total enrollment to about 300.</LD>
<LD>   The increase in applications, officials contend, is credited in part
to the attention brought by the Jan. 16 shooting.</LD>

<HD>Cardinal, Under Fire, Skips Mass</HD>
<DH>Protests: It was the first time in nearly two decades that Boston
archbishop Law failed to perform the sacrament at Holy Cross Cathedral.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>Pots of lilies abounded Sunday on the altar at Holy Cross Cathedral
here. Men in white robes offered the sacraments--a proud, ancient ritual.
Worshipers knelt and sang and shared the spirit of Communion.</LD>
<LD>   But at the 11 a.m. Mass, something--or rather, someone--was missing.</LD>
<LD>   In the face of an escalating scandal over clerical sexual abuse,
Cardinal Bernard Law--the archbishop of Boston and the highest-ranking
Catholic prelate in the U.S.--remained in his chancery. Except when he
was out of town or in ill health, his absence Sunday was the first time
faithful Catholics here could remember that Law had skipped Mass at his
cathedral since coming here in 1984.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed," said 75-year-old Albert Madden, who is retired.
"It broke a long streak of him saying Mass. When the crunch came, he
didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Law missed a sanctuary that was less full than usual, with fewer than
one-quarter of the pews filled--and that included three busloads of high
school students from New Orleans, in town for a band competition.</TE>
<TE>   In his absence, he also bypassed a feisty demonstration outside the
hulking Gothic cathedral in the city's South End. Practicing Catholics
all, the three dozen men, women and children aimed much of their ire
directly at Law, who informed fellow priests Friday that despite new
evidence that he was aware of pedophile priests in his archdiocese, he
would not step down as cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   Portrait artist Casserine Toussaint, 48, passed out "Bernie bucks"
shaped like dollar bills, but with Law's face in the center.</TE>
<TE>   "It buys you 10 years off purgatory," said Toussaint, who also carried
a parasol adorned with a sign reading "Bernie, go."</TE>
<TE>   Calling herself a "cradle Catholic, with all the sacraments,"
Toussaint said it galled her that Law avoided the main Mass. She is
outraged by the scandal that has swept the church worldwide since the
January child molestation trial and conviction in Boston of defrocked
priest John J. Geoghan--but she saves special venom for the cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   "My Catholic faith has been a huge source of consolation to me, all my
life," she said. "I am appalled that his toxic narcissism will prevent
other people from enjoying what I have enjoyed."</TE>
<TE>   Carrying a poster that read "Bernard Law--Morally Bankrupt--Resign
Now," Carole Gunning, 60, said she chose to protest the Mass, rather than
attend it, because "I wanted to do something. I feel paralyzed, and I
don't want to be passive. So I am here now."</TE>
<TE>   Gunning, an administrator at MIT, said the idea that legions of
priests for decades were preying on children "goes right to the core of
me."</TE>
<TE>   Since Geoghan was jailed in January, the Boston archdiocese has given
prosecutors the names of more than 80 priests suspected of molesting
children over 40 years. Dozens of priests around the country have been
removed from their parishes this year as hundreds of alleged abuse
victims have stepped forward.</TE>
<TE>   But disclosures last week that Law and the Boston archdiocese
knowingly shipped a pedophile priest to a new assignment in Southern
California added fuel to the growing wrath among Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   "The cover-up is worse than the crime," Gunning said. "The crime was
committed by sick priests. Those who took part in the cover-up, they
don't have the excuse of being sick."</TE>
<TE>   As Mass was about to begin Sunday, police asked physicist Richard Webb
to stop shouting into his bullhorn. Webb gave one last cry of "Prison for
Law! Prison for the man who wears the red hat of shame!" and then
politely set his loudspeaker aside.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the cathedral, Msgr. Fred Murphy conducted the service in Law's
absence. In a lesson about the disciples, Murphy said that in the last
week, "particularly in the city here and in the archdiocese, we have all
experienced the confusion and disappointment of the disciples. Things
have not turned out as we expected. People have disappointed us."</TE>
<TE>   He offered a special prayer, "particularly for families of children
who have been abused by clergy."</TE>
<TE>   That acknowledgment was of little comfort to Stephen Lewis, a
44-year-old custodian who said he was abused by a priest in nearby Lynn,
Mass., when he was 10 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Until this year--and especially, until the last week--Lewis said he
considered himself "Catholic, with a struggling limp." He even sang in
the Boston archdiocese papal choir until recently.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, this totally destroys it," Lewis said. "The fact that this man
is so arrogant--and it is all about power, power and money."</TE>
<TE>   But Lewis had an admonition.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing positive could be said about the horror of priests abusing
children, he conceded. "But right now, the Boston archdiocese could be a
model," Lewis said. "We have a window of opportunity here, a unique
moment--and a brief one--to hold the administrative Catholic church
accountable."</TE>

<CX>   Cardinal Law--A headline for a story in Monday's Section A about
Boston's Cardinal Bernard Law incorrectly stated that he had not missed a
Mass at Holy Cross Cathedral since 1984. As the story stated,
parishioners could not recall his having missed a Mass with the exception
of illness or having been out of town.</CX>

<LD>In designing the new American government, the founders expected
tremors in public opinion to rattle the windows in the House of
Representatives before anyplace else. James Madison, in "The Federalist
Papers," insisted that of all the government's branches, the House most
needed "an immediate dependence on, and intimate sympathy with, the
people." To stay attuned to the people, Madison believed House members
had to stay accountable to the people, with frequent elections that he
considered the only way to ensure that "dependence and sympathy."</LD>
<LD>   Two hundred fifteen years later, House members still stand for
election every two years.</LD>
<LD>   They just don't face much risk anymore that they will lose those
elections.</LD>
<TE>   Perversely, the House has become the arm of government that is now
arguably the most insulated from shifts in the public mood. Throughout
the 1990s, almost three-fourths of the 435 House seats never changed
hands between the parties, calculates independent political analyst
Rhodes Cook. The signs point toward even less turnover in the years
ahead. Even this far from election day, it appears that only about four
dozen House seats may generate plausible races this year. By this fall,
experts on both sides expect the number of truly competitive contests to
drop to as few as two dozen.</TE>
<TE>   It's a trend that should have Madison turning in his grave. "It's
outrageous," says Mark Gersh, Washington director of the National
Committee for an Effective Congress, a leading liberal political action
committee. "The political trends are muted with this many noncompetitive
seats, because even if the public wants to express an opinion about what
is going on in Congress, they can't. It is really a perversion of
democracy."</TE>
<TE>   Partly, the death of competition in the House can be explained by
natural causes. In recent years, many of the most competitive seats were
held by members caught, in effect, behind enemy lines: Southern Democrats
holding seats voting Republican for president, or Northeastern
Republicans in the opposite position. As voters have harmonized their
votes for president and Congress, many of those legislators have now been
replaced with representatives more unambiguously in tune with the
district's dominant ideology. That evolution has taken many of those
districts out of play.</TE>
<TE>   But far less benign factors have also contributed to the collapse in
competition. One is money. In the 2000 election, the average House
incumbent raised almost six times as much as his or her opponent. A
financial disadvantage isn't always fatal in Senate races because those
contests attract enough media attention to let challengers become known,
even if they can't match the incumbent's television budget. But House
races usually draw less coverage than high school baseball games. That
means House challengers without the money to buy advertising are almost
always doomed.</TE>
<TE>   Just as important in the muffling of competition has been
redistricting. That's the process where states, once every 10 years,
redraw the lines of congressional districts after the census maps the new
distribution of population.</TE>
<TE>   This year's redistricting is likely to be remembered as a bipartisan
monument to back-scratching. In a few states where one party controlled
the state legislature and the governorship, it used that leverage to draw
maps that will tilt several congressional seats in its direction. Most
often, though, the two parties colluded to protect incumbents, creating
districts so heavily Republican or Democratic that the other party has
little chance of ever taking them.</TE>
<TE>   The most dramatic example is in California. In the 1990s, about
one-fifth of the state's congressional districts changed hands between
the parties at least once. But Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at UC
San Diego, says the state's 53 districts now all lean so heavily toward
one side or the other, it's possible none will change partisan control
until the next redistricting, 10 years from now.</TE>
<TE>   And California isn't alone. "It is going to be true all over the
country," says former Republican National Committee general counsel
Benjamin Ginsberg, who consults with state Republican parties on
redistricting. "If there are two dozen seats at play in any election
[nationwide], it is going to be a lot."</TE>
<TE>   That prospect has several implications, none of them healthy. First it
means that absent some major unpredictable event--a recession, a big
scandal--there won't be enough truly competitive seats to give either
party more than a slim majority in the House. "They are locked into
narrow margins," says Ginsberg.</TE>
<TE>   That will make governing tough. Governing will get even tougher as
more House members represent seats so safe that they don't have to
consider the views of voters outside their own base. That allows--indeed
encourages--them to embrace purist ideological positions, which impedes
compromise.</TE>
<TE>   It is probably no coincidence that legislators were more willing to
cross party lines on key issues when more of them had to run in
competitive districts. Twenty years ago, members of Congress sided with
their own party on about three-fourths of major votes, according to
Congressional Quarterly. On average since 1995, Democrats have voted with
their own party 83% of the time, and Republicans 88%. An excess of safe
seats is transforming Congress into "Crossfire."</TE>
<TE>   The heaviest price for shrinking competition will be paid by voters,
especially moderate voters not firmly aligned with either party. Those
swing voters will be dissected and courted and coddled in presidential
elections and statewide races for governor or senator. But in most House
districts, they can be safely ignored because the result is guaranteed by
the die-hard partisans around them. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of
Americans who vote this fall will cast ballots in House races where one
candidate is so likely to win that individual voters have no realistic
chance of changing the outcome. That's a mockery of Madison's vision of
the people's house and a bipartisan assault on the right to cast a
meaningful vote.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A woman is suing a snack food company for $50 million, saying its
label on Pirate's Booty corn and rice puffs foiled her diet.</LD>
<LD>   In her New York lawsuit, Meredith Berkman, 37, claims she suffered
"emotional distress" because the snack contained three times more fat
than its label advertised. Berkman said it caused her "weight gain . . .
mental anguish, outrage and indignation."</LD>
<LD>   Pirate's Booty, manufactured by Robert's American Gourmet Food Inc.,
was recalled in January after the Good Housekeeping Institute found it
contained 147 calories and 8.5 grams of fat, while its label said it
contained only 120 calories and 2.5 grams of fat.</LD>
<TE>   The company said the discrepancy was a result of new machinery that
changed the nutritional information on three of its snacks: Pirate's
Booty, Veggie Booty and Fruity Booty.</TE>

<LD>Two spacewalking astronauts successfully rewired the international
space station to extend the reach of its robot arm--via a railroad.</LD>
<LD>   It was the third spacewalk by the visiting crew of space shuttle
Atlantis, with a fourth and final excursion planned Tuesday to finish
installing a 44-foot girder equipped with a rail car and track.</LD>
<LD>   By rerouting power, data and video cables, the spacewalkers paved the

<HD>Partisanship Is About to Sink Budget Plan</HD>
<DH>Congress: Agreement on spending caps eludes lawmakers in an
election year, which opens the door for a 'free-for-all' on pet projects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Congress is about to fall down on its most basic job: writing a
budget plan for the U.S. government.</LD>
<LD>   Even though Republicans and Democrats are not far apart on many key
spending priorities, lawmakers are so polarized in this election year
that it seems increasingly unlikely they will adopt a budget resolution.</LD>
<LD>   Such a resolution, which sets an annual ceiling on government
spending, is supposed to be passed by today. But there's no final plan in
sight.</LD>
<TE>   That does not mean the government grinds to a halt. But it does
mean--without an overall budget cap--it will be harder to keep lawmakers
from adding pet projects to the appropriation bills that fund specific
agencies and programs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in for a free-for-all," Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) said.</TE>
<TE>   The situation could put tremendous pressure on President Bush, whose
veto may loom as the only strong check on spending. Bush told Republican
leaders last week he was prepared to wield his authority for the sake of
fiscal discipline.</TE>
<TE>   "He's itching to do it," Santorum said.</TE>
<TE>   The partisan logjam on the budget resolution shows how much the
climate has changed in Congress since the immediately after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, when differences between the parties melted away and
lawmakers quickly passed an array of complex measures.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Congress seems incapable of bridging differences large and small.
The result is impasse on issues ranging from energy policy to the
confirmation of judicial nominees. Even a bill to correct a grammatical
error in an obscure 1925 statute on legal procedures has stalled in the
Senate.</TE>
<TE>   No issue is more fundamental to Congress' role as guardian of the
public purse than the budget process that has guided government spending
decisions since 1974.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to be living in a lawless, ruleless world with regard to
budget" if Congress does not agree to a spending cap, said Carol Cox
Waite, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a
nonpartisan watchdog group.</TE>
<TE>   The budget process was designed to force Congress to set parameters
for spending and revenue by today, before it passes tax and spending
bills for particular programs.</TE>
<TE>   Although Congress can--and often does--override the proposed ceiling,
the budget makes it more difficult for spending to increase willy-nilly.
For example, three-fifths of the Senate, not a simple majority, is needed
to pass a spending measure that violates the budget.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican-controlled House, on a narrow party-line vote, in March
passed a resolution for a $2.1-trillion budget that broadly reflected
Bush's priorities and allowed for a $45-billion deficit. It made room for
the big funding increases for defense and homeland security; conversely,
the plan would slow the growth of spending for an array of domestic
programs.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic-controlled Senate, however, appears stalemated in its
budget debate. The Senate Budget Committee, on a party-line vote, last
month approved a competing resolution that would give Bush none of the
additional tax cuts he requested while spending more than the House plan
on domestic programs and debt reduction.</TE>
<TE>   But Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) has no immediate plans
to bring the budget resolution to the floor, acknowledging that he does
not have the votes to pass it. Republican leaders say none of their ranks
will vote for the resolution, and some Democrats have said they cannot
support it. Sen. Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.), for one, said it does not
reduce the deficit enough.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have begun to lambaste Democrats for not passing a budget,
saying it is evidence of their inability to do more than criticize the
GOP.</TE>
<TE>   Said Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.): "What better example
of whether or not you can govern than whether or not you have a budget
for the year?"</TE>
<TE>   Daschle has said he expects the Senate will take up the budget "at
some point." But it wasn't included in Daschle's recent list of bills
next up in the Senate. And a senior advisor to Daschle said that even if
the Senate passed a budget, it would be hard to reach a compromise in a
conference committee with House members.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's a conference product that can come out of
this," said the advisor, who requested anonymity. "What good is it doing
a budget resolution?"</TE>
<TE>   In truth, the House and Senate resolutions are not that different in
the short term: Both would increase defense and homeland security
spending and both would run deficits to help pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   But provisions for the years ahead diverge in ways that neither side
may be inclined to reconcile. The Senate budget, for instance, would not
guarantee Bush the defense buildup he seeks after 2004.</TE>
<TE>   If no budget resolution is enacted, Democrats say they may find some
other way to set a spending target for the year. But such a plan would
lack enforcement tools.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Congress will be buffeted by election-year pressures to
spend, impulses compounded by the bipartisan willingness to open the
government's purse at a time when economic growth is tentative and the
military is mobilized against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   That's why fiscal conservatives have urged Bush to be ready to veto
potentially bloated spending bills later this year. House Speaker J.
Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) said Bush told him last week he would use the
House-passed budget resolution as his "veto guide."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats bridled at Bush's talk of a veto threat before Congress even
begins to put pen to paper for appropriation bills.</TE>
<TE>   And some Republicans may bridle if, on the eve of November's
elections, Bush vetoes bills that include projects their constituents
value.</TE>
<TE>   "Not all our guys will be happy with that," said a top GOP leadership
aide.</TE>

<HD>Toddler Curiosity Found to Boost IQ</HD>
<DH>Research: Youngsters who show more exuberance and sociability score
higher on intelligence tests when they are older.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Children who are outgoing and adventurous as toddlers have
substantially higher IQs by the time they are preteens, according to new
research by scientists studying how personality shapes intelligence.</LD>
<LD>   Seeking links between childhood behavior and mental ability,
scientists at USC and UC Riverside compared how eagerly youngsters sought
out new experiences at age 3 and how well they performed on various tests
of mental ability eight years later at age 11.</LD>
<LD>   The most adventurous and curious 3-year-olds scored 12 points higher
on total IQ when they were tested--"a substantial gain" over their shyer
peers--the scientists reported today in the Journal of Personality and
Social Psychology.</LD>
<TE>   The children also showed superior scholastic and reading ability.</TE>
<TE>   This measurable difference in mental ability held true for boys and
girls, and across variations in ethnic background and income levels, the
researchers said. The amount of parental involvement and education did
not appear to matter either.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter how you cut the pie; the effect shows up no matter
what group you look at," said USC neuropsychologist Adrian Raine, who led
the research team.</TE>
<TE>   "It is like they are carrying their own Head Start program in their
heads."</TE>
<TE>Adventurous Behavior Could Be Taught</TE>
<TE>   There is considerable debate about the origins of intelligence;
researchers have been unable to sort out the effects of genetics, family
upbringing, nutrition and behavior. Studies of twins highlight hereditary
influences, while laboratory experiments implicate the role of
environment. Nature and nurture inevitably intertwine.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, the research cannot show whether the children's outgoing
curiosity as toddlers was the cause of their better scores on IQ tests or
whether children who have higher IQs are, by nature, more curious and
outgoing.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers, however, believe that the toddlers' adventurous
behavior is the cause and the IQ gain the effect. They also think that it
may be possible to teach the helpful behavior to other children.</TE>
<TE>   If their findings bear out, it could have "significant" implications
for theories of how intelligence develops and "practical implications for
how intelligence can be increased," the researchers reported.</TE>
<TE>   Gregarious 3-year-olds, the researchers found, had higher intelligence
scores than 3-year-olds who were skilled at assembling blocks, copying
shapes or identifying people and objects.</TE>
<TE>   "Young children who physically explore their environment, engage
socially with other children, and verbally interact with adults create
for themselves an enriched, stimulating, varied and challenging
environment," Raine said.</TE>
<TE>   This, in turn, results in "enhanced cognitive ability and better
school performance."</TE>
<TE>   Until now, no one had documented a link between how readily very young
children seek out stimulation and their mental abilities later in life.</TE>
<TE>   Raine is best known for more controversial work in seeking the roots
of antisocial behavior.</TE>
<TE>   In earlier studies, he has scanned the brains of convicted murderers
for clues to the biology of violence. He has monitored heart rates,
measured glucose metabolism and recorded brain wave patterns in search of
a telltale signature that could predict aggressive behavior.</TE>
<TE>   But in this newest research, Raine and his colleagues instead gained
an insight into how personality molds the mind in a positive way.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Raine and his colleagues studied nearly 1,800 boys and girls
growing up on the isolated island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, as
part of a long-running project on childhood health and development.</TE>
<TE>Some Children Create Enriched Environments</TE>
<TE>   The researchers measured how often 3-year-old preschoolers engaged in
conversations with other children and adults, how they played, how
energetically they explored their surroundings, and how much generally
they sought stimulating circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   A battery of standard tests measured basic verbal, numeric and spatial
abilities. In a bow to the island's local culture, the children were
given sugar cane sticks to measure length, rocks to judge size, and a tea
set to assess their ability to follow directions. Eight years later, the
same children were given a variety of tests to measure intelligence,
reading ability and scholastic achievement.</TE>
<TE>   The findings, the researchers said, suggest that these more actively
engaged children create for themselves a more enriched environment than
traditional educational enrichment programs.</TE>
<TE>   "This environment, in contrast to [educational] programs, can produce
long-term IQ changes that last throughout childhood," they said.</TE>

<HD>Acne-Drug Campaign Aimed at Preventing Birth Defects</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE KNICH</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Starting last week, patients filling prescriptions for the acne drug
Accutane have to follow unusually strict rules imposed by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration and Roche Pharmaceuticals aimed at
preventing pregnant women from taking the drug, which is known to
cause miscarriages and severe birth defects.</LD>
<LD>   The program, known as SMART--an acronym for System to Manage
Accutane-Related Teratogenicity (birth defects caused by a
drug)--enlists doctors, pharmacists and patients to stop women who
are already pregnant from taking Accutane and to keep women who are
taking the drug from becoming pregnant while on it.</LD>
<LD>   Women who want to start taking the oral medication will have to
show their doctor they've had two recent negative pregnancy tests
before being issued a prescription. Each month before refilling their
prescription, they will have to get another pregnancy test. They will
also need to agree to use two forms of birth control or completely
avoid sexual intercourse while taking the drug and for a month after
stopping. Women and men must sign consent forms indicating that they
are aware of the drug's risks, which also include depression and
suicidal thoughts.</LD>
<TE>   Physicians will have to register with Roche and sign an agreement
saying they understand the drug's risks and agree to follow the new
guidelines for prescribing it. They will also be required to provide
patient counseling or referrals about effective pregnancy prevention;
write prescriptions for no more than a one-month supply; get a
negative pregnancy test from female patients before writing another
prescription; and apply a bright yellow qualification sticker--the
cornerstone of the SMART program--on all Accutane prescriptions they
write.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmacists will be expected to fill only prescriptions bearing a
yellow sticker, dispense only a one-month supply at a time and refuse
to fill prescriptions more than seven days old.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmacist Joe Smith, owner of the Medicine Shoppe in Falls
Church, Va., called the new safety measures extraordinary. Accutane,
he said, now carries more instructions and warnings than any drug
he's ever seen. Besides the warnings printed on the package, he has
to hand out a large medication guide with each prescription. "It's
almost a matter of overkill," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a consumer
advocacy group, complained that the program doesn't go far enough and
that the controversial drug is over-prescribed.</TE>
<TE>   There are two facts about Accutane on which physicians,
pharmacists, the FDA and Roche agree. The first is that Accutane
works. Within four to six months, it clears up the nasty kind of acne
that lodges painful red lumps deep under the skin and leaves
inflamed, pus-filled lesions that often cause permanent scars. The
second is that, for women who get pregnant while taking Accutane or
who begin taking the drug when they are already pregnant, the drug
carries significant risk of miscarriage, premature birth or severe
birth defects. Exactly how many women have become pregnant while
taking the drug is not known. FDA reports between 1982 and Dec. 31,
2001, show 2,261 pregnancies for women who had been exposed to
Accutane. Of these, 1,349 chose to abort, 252 had spontaneous
abortions, 195 had normal babies and 167 had babies with birth
defects.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, in response to even more pregnancies, the FDA and Roche
launched the "Pregnancy Prevention Program for Accutane," a voluntary
program aimed at educating patients to avoid pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   The program recommended many of the same measures required by
SMART including pregnancy tests before starting the drug and two
forms of birth control while on it, but it had no method like the
yellow qualification sticker to ensure compliance. It recommended but
didn't require monthly pregnancy tests.</TE>
<TE>   The new SMART program mandates these tests and prohibits call-in
prescriptions.</TE>
<TE>   But Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research
Group, wants more. His organization has petitioned the FDA repeatedly
since 1982 to permit only dermatologists to write Accutane
prescriptions--any doctor can now write them--and only for patients
who exhibit severe forms of acne and have had no success with other
acne medications.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Wilkin, director of the FDA's Division of Dermatologic
and Dental Drug Products, said that if the SMART program does not
succeed in reducing birth defects tied to Accutane, the agency will
institute an even stricter program.</TE>

<HD>Study: Circumcision Reduces Cancer Risk</HD>
<DH>Procedure helps to lessen men's chances of contracting
sexual diseases, researchers say, and may lower the rate of cervical
cancer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DELTHIA RICKS</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Women whose sex partners are circumcised have lower rates of cervical
cancer, and their male partners have lower rates of sexually
transmitted disorders, researchers found in an international
investigation released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   For years, doctors have known that the human papillomavirus (HPV)
is the cause of 99% of all cases of cervical cancer and that men who
have multiple sex partners are most likely to transmit it.</LD>
<LD>   Seven studies in five countries and on three continents found that
circumcision is the key to limiting the spread of the cancer. Men who
underwent surgical removal of the foreskin as infants, researchers
said, were less likely to harbor and transmit HPV, which can thrive
in the foreskin's crevices. Cervical cancer, affecting about 13,000
women in the U.S. this year, is a major cause of death for women
worldwide. In developing countries, the malignancy is a leading cause
of death, outnumbering breast and uterine cancers. Globally, more
than 460,000 cases of the cancer will be diagnosed this year.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Xavier Castellsague of Llobregat Hospital in Barcelona, Spain,
found in his review of the major studies on HPV transmission and
cancer that HPV could be detected in 20% of all uncircumcised men
studied. That compared with slightly more than 5% of circumcised men.
Women whose sex partners were circumcised had a 58% lower risk of
cervical cancer than did women whose partners were uncircumcised.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Dimitrios Trichopoulos, an epidemiologist at Harvard
University's School of Public Health, said doctors have long
suspected that male circumcision could help reduce the risk of
cervical cancer, but there was no solid scientific proof until now.
"I would recommend circumcision of all male babies," Trichopoulos
said, "but I don't think that will ever happen." Instead, he
recommended condom use and proper hygiene.</TE>
<TE>   HPV causes cervical cancer by insinuating into the genes of
healthy cells, transmuting them into malignant ones. Regular Pap
smears can detect cellular changes within the cervix, doctors say.
The cancer is curable when detected early. Medical researchers are
testing an HPV vaccine.</TE>

<HD>Don't Brush Off Scallops, Crab Meat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHELDON MARGEN and DALE A. OGAR</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shellfish sometimes get ignored because they are perceived as a
luxury and a nutritional no-no. Though it is true that shellfish are
somewhat high in cholesterol, they are very low in fat, with almost
no saturated fat. Most authorities agree that saturated fat is the
bigger risk factor for heart disease.</LD>
<LD>   Lobster and shrimp are probably the most popular of all shellfish,
but two others to consider are scallops and crab.</LD>
<LD>   Scallops: Unlike shellfish that can be kept alive until cooking,
scallops aren't able to close their shells tightly and, as a result,
die soon after harvesting. In order to maintain freshness, they are
usually shucked and trimmed aboard the fishing boats or shortly
thereafter. This makes preparation extremely easy.</LD>
<TE>   Scallops are lower in cholesterol than other shellfish (34
milligrams in 3 ounces of cooked scallops). Unfortunately, they are
not among the bigger sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which help
protect against heart disease and appear to have anti-inflammatory
properties. A normal serving (3 ounces) contains 113 calories, 331
milligrams of potassium, 435 milligrams of sodium and 62% of the
recommended daily allowance for vitamin B-12. Scallops are also a
good source of magnesium and vitamin E.</TE>
<TE>   There are two kinds of scallops readily available commercially:
bay scallops, which are quite small and have a sweet, delicate
flavor, and sea scallops, which are larger, chewier and less
expensive. Another variety, known as the Calico scallop, is actually
a small sea scallop sometimes sold as a bay scallop.</TE>
<TE>   The height of the season for fresh scallops is October through
March, but you can usually find them year-round. If you buy fresh
scallops, make sure they have a sweet smell. They should be glossy
and firm, but if they're bright white and bulging, causing them to
"melt" together, they have probably been soaked in something to make
them heavier or preserved with phosphates to keep them fresh longer.</TE>
<TE>   Watch out for bay scallops that are very uniform. They may have
been cut out of larger, less desirable sea scallops.</TE>
<TE>   As always with seafood, it is important to keep scallops very cold
until you are ready to cook them. And don't take the chance of
cross-contaminating cooked foods by having them come in contact with
any raw fish or meat.</TE>
<TE>   Scallops take very little cooking time. They can be added to pasta
sauces; poached and used in salads; substituted for shrimp in dishes
like scampi, marinara or other favorites; stir-fried with vegetables;
or skewered (sea scallops) and grilled.</TE>
<TE>   Crab: Nutritionally, crab meat contains good quantities of
protein, niacin, zinc, folate, iron and selenium. It is also
extremely high in vitamin B-12 (more than 250% of the RDA in a
3-ounce serving). Like regular fish, it also contains protective
omega fatty acids. Regardless of whether the crabs come from the
Atlantic or the Pacific oceans (or from freshwater areas), there are
two main types: crabs that swim (like the blue crab) and crabs that
walk (like the rock crab). Within those two broad categories are
several different kinds in the market in most areas.</TE>
<TE>   When you are buying crab, use your eyes and your nose. They should
smell fresh and look bright and clean. The shells should be hard
(except for the soft-shell varieties), and if they are alive, they
should be active. They should feel heavy for their size.</TE>
<TE>   If you are buying cooked crab, it should smell completely fresh.
Avoid any with ammonia or fishy odors, and look for those with bright
orange-red shells.</TE>
<TE>   The meat should be pure white (although some pieces may be tinged
with a little brown or red). Ask to make sure that it was cooked the
day you are buying it, and look to see that it is not being displayed
next to any raw fish or shellfish that could contaminate it with
bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   If you are buying live crabs, cook and eat them the same day you
purchase them. However, fresh-cooked crab meat will keep in your
refrigerator for a day or two.</TE>
<TE>   Crab meat is incredibly versatile because has a very mild taste.
It will absorb the flavor of anything you cook it with. It makes a
great addition to a burrito or enchilada. Crab cakes are delicious,
but be careful to fry them quickly in very hot oil so they don't
absorb too much extra fat.</TE>

<HD>Another View of Cardiac Center at Mission Hospital</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was surprised and disappointed that Trudy Lieberman used Mission
Hospital as a negative example for her "Health Matters" column
("Hospitals Appeal to the Heart," March 18), which focused on
competition and cost in cardiac-care services.</LD>
<LD>   There were several inaccuracies and clearly a lack of
understanding regarding the purpose of the Muldoon Cardiac Center at
Mission Hospital, which opened in January to serve the rapidly
expanding needs of south Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   Mission Hospital does not need to attract new patients from nearby
hospitals, as the article misstated.</LD>
<TE>   It is simply a case of supply and demand--something recognized by
the many generous donors, such as Edward and Ann Muldoon, who made
the cardiac center a reality.</TE>
<TE>   The population in the primary service area is estimated to
increase by 10% by 2005, with a 22.9% increase in adults ages 45 to
63, many of whom will need quality cardiac care.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Hospital expanded its cardiac facilities to a new floor to
absorb these needs and help save the lives of numerous residents.</TE>
<TE>   The center enables the hospital to increase its cardiac
intensive-care capacity by 35% in a technologically advanced and
nurturing environment.</TE>
<TE>   The article further stated that there is a negative correlation
between volume of cardiac procedures performed annually and quality
of care.</TE>
<TE>   However, Mission Hospital rates better than the national average
in readmission rates for open-heart surgery, and the cardiac
interventional services have earned a five-star rating from Health
Grades.</TE>
<TE>   Now, an even greater number of patients in need will benefit from
this quality care.</TE>

<HD>Questioning the Benefits of EMDR</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I read with interest Linda Marsa's article "Trauma Therapy's New
Focus" (March 25).</LD>
<LD>   Contrary to the impression created by her article, clinical
studies have shown that EMDR (eye-movement desensitization
reprocessing) is vastly inferior to other cognitive-behavioral
treatments for panic disorder and for phobia. Moving one's eyes back
and forth is not the best way to overcome either of these problems.</LD>
<LD>   Although EMDR is more effective than nothing at all for
post-traumatic stress disorder, research has repeatedly failed to
show that the eye movements (or tapping) add anything to the
desensitization (and placebo) components of EMDR.</LD>

<LD>Question: What is the best home fitness equipment to help me lose fat
fast (before summer)?</LD>
<LD>   I want to shed 10 pounds. I am 5 feet 6 and 145 pounds. I used to
be good about going to the gym until my work schedule got hectic.</LD>
<LD>   PATTY FREED</LD>
<TE>   Quebec City, Canada</TE>
<TE>   Answer: You bring up two important points--quick weight loss and
how to fit exercise into a hectic schedule. Let's deal with the
weight-loss issue first.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what you read, hear or imagine, quick weight loss
usually is not permanent, because our bodies just don't burn fat
really fast.</TE>
<TE>   When you see a dramatic drop on the scale, it's usually from water
loss. Why don't you shoot for 3 to 5 pounds by June, focusing on ways
to keep healthy and active throughout and after the summer? This will
help you reach your ongoing fitness and weight-management goals.</TE>
<TE>   As for inexpensive ways to get fit, try buying a jump rope and a
pair of light hand weights (5 to 8 pounds). Alternate between jump
rope sets and strength-training exercises such as crunches, push-ups
and other free-weight exercises.</TE>
<TE>   Also, take advantage of the warm weather and the longer summer
days by going for regular walks, runs or bike rides.</TE>
<TE>   Exercise doesn't have to be an "all or nothing" endeavor. Do your
best during the busy times, and try not to let the exercising itself
stress you out.</TE>
<TE>   Stick to a balanced eating plan, and I'm sure you'll soon see a
weight loss.</TE>

<HD>Study Dismissing St. John's Wort Raises More Questions</HD>
<DH>Research* Some medical experts argue that recent findings
claiming the herb to be ineffective in treating severe depression are
inconclusive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Definitive though it may have sounded, the recent federal study of
St. John's wort still hasn't answered all the questions about the
herb's effectiveness in treating depression.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers reported last week that the herb failed to alleviate
moderately severe cases of the illness, which can interfere with
work, sleep, eating habits and personal relationships. The $6-million
study, begun in 1997, was the first multi-center clinical trial
funded by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative
Medicine, and the results were widely anticipated.</LD>
<LD>   But the research didn't deliver a verdict on whether the popular
herb can ease milder forms of the disorder. And study critics,
including the American Herbal Products Assn., the National
Nutritional Foods Assn. and the American Botanical Council, fear that
consumers will come away from the latest findings with the impression
that St. John's wort is useless for all depression.</LD>
<TE>   In the study, which was reported in the April 10 issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Assn., researchers studied 340 people
whose depression affected their daily activities, but who weren't
suicidal. After eight weeks, all the participants showed similar
results on two major measures of improvement--better scores on a
depression scale and being symptom-free--regardless of whether they
were given extracts of the plant Hypericum perforatum (St. John's
wort), the prescription antidepressant sertraline (Zoloft) or a
placebo.</TE>
<TE>   The lead researcher, Dr. Jonathan R.T. Davidson, a psychiatry
professor at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C., said
that on some secondary measures, patients taking Zoloft did a little
better than the other patients. But the small differences among the
treated and untreated groups suggest that St. John's wort wasn't
effective, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although it will take a series of studies to provide a definitive
answer, he said, "so far, there is no evidence that St. John's wort
is a leading candidate for the treatment of moderately severe major
depression."</TE>
<TE>   The results came a year after another JAMA study, funded by a
major pharmaceutical firm, found St. John's wort to be no better than
a placebo in treating major depression. Complementary health experts
attacked that study as well, saying the patients selected might have
been among those who just don't respond to any treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller studies have suggested the herb's effectiveness in milder
forms of depression, and experts say more definitive data on that
issue is needed.</TE>
<TE>   The center's director, Dr. Stephen E. Straus, said the decision to
first study use of the herb in more severe forms of depression before
studying its use in milder illness was based on public health
interests. People with more debilitating depression shouldn't
self-medicate, he said, but instead should seek professional guidance
and opt for established treatments, such as medication or
psychotherapy. Straus and depression experts hope that, by hearing
that St. John's wort would be unlikely to ease their depression,
those with severe forms might be more likely to seek help.</TE>
<TE>   Straus said the study should put to rest questions about the
herb's value in such cases.</TE>
<TE>   "In science, people have a hard time coming to closure and saying
that we have absolutely enough data," he said. "We have about 1,500
herbs to study. At some point, now that there have been two very good
studies, I think we should move on."</TE>
<TE>   The herb's effect on milder forms of the disorder will soon be
examined in a $4-million federal study at the Harvard-affiliated
Massachusetts General Hospital and two other centers.</TE>
<TE>   But some study critics say much is still unknown about the herb's
effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   "My feeling is we really have no data that it's not good for
severe depression," said Jerry Cott, a psychopharmacologist who
worked on the initial design for the study. Because study patients
who got St. John's wort or Zoloft did no better the placebo patients,
he said, it's hard to tell whether the study failed or the treatment
failed.</TE>

<HD>Allergy Medications With Side Effects</HD>
<DH>Drugs* Seemingly harmless over-the-counter remedies, such
as antihistamines and decongestants, can pose unexpected health
risks.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the hay fever season upon us, millions of allergy sufferers are
grabbing over-the-counter remedies to ease their sniffles, sneezes
and nasal congestion. But these seemingly innocuous drugs can have
unexpected consequences, especially for the elderly and those with
chronic illnesses.</LD>
<LD>   "Several of these products have significant side effects," said
Dr. Paul H. Ratner, co-author of an article on allergy and cold drugs
that appeared in this month's issue of Mayo Clinic Proceedings, the
journal of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. "They can also
counteract the effects of other medications."</LD>
<LD>   Experts are most concerned about the adverse effects of
antihistamines--which control such allergy symptoms as sneezing,
itching and runny nose--and pseudoephedrine, the active ingredient in
most decongestant cold medications.</LD>
<TE>   Antihistamines often make people feel sleepy--which isn't a
problem if you're ready for bed but can be dangerous if you're behind
the wheel.</TE>
<TE>   A 2000 University of Iowa study, which used a simulator to test
participants' responses, found that the driving performance of people
who had taken the antihistamine diphenhydramine (the active
ingredient in Benadryl) was even poorer then those who were legally
drunk.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, these medications dry up not only mucous membranes
but also other bodily fluids, which can create bladder and prostate
problems in people such as the elderly who already have difficulty
with urination.</TE>
<TE>   Pseudoephedrine (found in popular decongestants such as Dristan or
Actifed Cold &amp; Sinus), on the other hand, can cause insomnia,
hyperactivity in children and irregular heartbeats
(phenylpropanolamine and phenylephrine, two other decongestants, have
similar effects).</TE>
<TE>   The drug narrows blood vessels, which helps clear nasal
congestion, but can spike blood pressure in people with hypertension.
It can also interfere with the effects of sleeping pills or blood
pressure medication.</TE>
<TE>   "Allergies are not a trivial problem," says Dr. Michael Schatz,
chief of the department of allergy at Kaiser Permanente Medical
Center in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "People should consult with their doctors, who can prescribe
medications that are more effective with fewer side effects."</TE>
<TE>   If you can't see your physician, however, at least ask a
pharmacist about possible adverse reactions.</TE>
<TE>   "OTC drugs aren't like candy you can just pick up at the
convenience store," says Jeffery A. Goad, an assistant professor of
clinical pharmacy at the USC School of Pharmacy.</TE>
<TE>   "They're still potent medications."</TE>

<HD>Tongue Piercing's Effect on Teeth Isn't So Cool</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANNE PARTIE LANGE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The motivation to put a tiny barbell through the tongue may escape
anyone over age 22, but even young people would be smart to give up
tongue piercing if they care about their teeth. A study of 52 young
adults whose tongues were pierced found that receding gums were quite
common in the years following the procedure.</LD>
<LD>   About half of the men and women studied who had worn long barbells
for two years or longer had receding gums on their lower incisors.
This may be because a long barbell--defined for the study as one that
is 5/8 inch--is more likely to reach and physically damage the gums
than a short one. "We were surprised at how common this was, because
gum recession in this age group is rather unusual," says Dimitris N.
Tatakis, professor of periodontology at the Ohio State University
Health Sciences Center. And gum trouble wasn't all: 47% of those who
had pierced tongues for four years or more had chipped back teeth.</LD>
<LD>   Short barbells, with a stem length of 1/4 inch or less, were most
likely to chip teeth, possibly because the wearers tend to bite on
them. While piercers at tattoo parlors often advise customers to wear
plastic rather than metal barbells, says Tatakis, the young people
examined in this study wore both types. "We don't know if plastic
makes a difference in actual tooth fractures," he says. (Journal of
Periodontology: 73 [3]; pp. 289-297.)</LD>
<TE>   Black Cohosh Relieves Menopausal Symptoms</TE>
<TE>   Women who don't want to take estrogen replacement therapy for
menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes, may have an effective
alternative in black cohosh. It is the most popular herbal treatment
for menopause in Germany and is available without a prescription in
the United States as well.</TE>
<TE>   A study looking at how the herb affects tissues stimulated by
estrogen found that black cohosh had no estrogenic effects yet
relieved physical and emotional symptoms of menopause in women who
took it for 12 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   To test the safety and effects of Cimicifugae racemosae
rhizoma--also known as black cohosh, black snakeroot and rattlesnake
root--German researchers studied two doses of a pharmaceutical form
of the herb, Remifemin, in 149 perimenopausal and menopausal women.
One group of women received the usually recommended daily dose of
Remifemin, the trade name of an extract of the herb, for 12 weeks.
The second group took three times the usual dose every day. Most of
the women continued taking Remifemin for 24 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Both doses were effective, and there were no serious adverse
effects. Examination of cells from the vaginal lining showed none of
the increased growth that would have been seen if the herb acted like
estrogen. Female hormone levels did not change either. "I've
recommended this extract for years for women with mild to moderate
symptoms, like hot flashes, who are early in the menopausal process,"
says Dr. Mary Hardy, medical director of the integrative medicine
program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. "They may
still be having periods and don't want to take hormones just yet."
It's also useful for women at risk of breast or endometrial cancer or
who have fibroids, she says. Hardy is a consultant to
GlaxoSmithKline, which markets Remifemin in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The results of this research apply only to the extract studied.
There are several types of black cohosh available, and their effects
may not be the same. (Journal of Women's Health &amp; Gender-Based
Medicine: 11 [2]; pp. 163-174.)</TE>
<TE>   For Heart Patients, Mental Stress Can Have Physical Consequences</TE>
<TE>   Some people seem to take the stresses of life in stride, but for
others they create a host of health problems. Now researchers have
found that how heart patients react to stress may affect their
chances of dying.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier studies showed that stress can curtail blood flow to the
heart by as much as 70%. New research shows that people with heart
disease who have this kind of physical reaction to psychological
pressure have three times the risk of dying as those who don't.</TE>
<TE>   A group of 196 people, mostly men, had an exercise stress test and
a mental stress test done while a kind of motion picture of blood
flow through their hearts was recorded, using a technique called
radionuclide angiography. When the tests were done, all the
participants had either had a previous heart attack or had over 50%
narrowing of at least one heart blood vessel. The patients were
tracked for about five years after testing, a period during which
some of them died. The mental stress test detected abnormal blood
flow to the heart in 20% of participants.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen of those tested died over the following years, and 40%
of them had abnormal reactions to mental stress. Although the study
does have shortcomings--there was no recording of nonfatal heart
attacks, and the cause of death wasn't reported--the researchers
believe that further study would be useful to learn how to tailor
treatment to those at risk. Stress management, for instance, might be
useful.</TE>
<TE>   According to David S. Sheps, professor of medicine and associate
chief of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Florida College
of Medicine in Gainesville, researchers are working on a mental
stress test that could be available in the future. (Circulation 2002:
105.)</TE>
<TE>   Splints Can Replace Surgery on Infants' Misshapen Ears</TE>
<TE>   By the time most children with misshapen or prominent ears can
have corrective surgery, they have been exposed to years of unkind
remarks and stares. That's because surgeons must wait until the ear
is more than 90% of its adult size, typically when the child is 5 or
6 years old, before attempting to repair it. Taking the lead from
orthopedists who have learned that splinting can help correct some
types of hip and foot deformities, plastic surgeons in Israel are
using similar techniques to coax congenitally misshapen ears into
their proper position.</TE>
<TE>   A study of 92 ears on 52 newborns found that splinting the ears
with a customized mold for about seven weeks on average produced
excellent results in 87% of the babies' ears. In each case referred
to them soon after birth, a team of surgeons in Rambam Medical Center
in Haifa placed a mold of the desired shape in the child's ear and
then, using surgical tape, positioned the ear close to the child's
head.</TE>
<TE>   The parents were taught how to remove the splint for cleaning and
replace it every two days for six to 12 weeks. Six months later, 87%
of the ears had achieved excellent results, according to the parents.</TE>
<TE>   An ear deformity may not be obvious until later in infancy, but
when it is noticed at birth and treated with splinting when the
cartilage is still malleable, the child may be spared not only years
of teasing but also the complications that can follow later surgery,
the researchers conclude. And splinting is a lot less costly.</TE>
<TE>   Lead author Yehuda Ullman of Rambam Medical Center says the
technique is accessible and easy to perform, but the medical
profession and the general public aren't aware that early correction
is possible.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Luce, president of the American Society of Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgeons, says he is not aware of any U.S. surgeons
trying it yet. "The hitch," he says, "is getting referrals from
pediatricians when the babies are young enough to have this done."

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: As a pediatrician, I often feel like a one-woman army
trying to combat simultaneous use of acetaminophen (Tylenol) and
ibuprofen (Motrin, etc.) for children with fever. Some parents
alternate doses as often as every two hours; others give these
medications together to bring down a fever.</LD>
<LD>   Fever is a physiologic function that helps the body fight
infections. I try to educate parents about this, but there's an
almost irrational fear of fever in our culture.</LD>
<LD>   I am also alarmed about recent case reports of kidney failure in
children who had received this combination.</LD>
<TE>   Answer: "Fever phobia" is a concern of many pediatricians. A mild
elevation in temperature is part of an immune-system reaction to
infection, and lowering such a fever might be counterproductive.</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence that alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen
or administering both drugs together lowers fever faster.</TE>
<TE>   Q: A friend of mine sent me an article about garlic being toxic.
He says it slows reflexes and impairs concentration. I am a great fan
of garlic and use a lot of it when I cook, but now I am concerned
about what my love of garlic might be doing to my health.</TE>
<TE>   A: We think this is an urban legend. Garlic has been used in
cooking and healing for thousands of years. If garlic were really
hazardous, cooks around the world would be in big trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have documented the cardiovascular benefits of garlic,
and it seems to help control blood sugar and might reduce the risk of
certain cancers.</TE>
<TE>   High doses of garlic, either as a dietary supplement or in food,
can irritate the digestive tract, with possible heartburn and nausea
as a result. Surgeons sometimes warn patients to avoid large amounts
of garlic before an operation to reduce the risk of excessive
bleeding.</TE>
<TE>   Q: I'm a 39-year-old woman in need of an herb that can decrease
sex drive. I think you've written about this before, but I can't
recall the herb you suggested. I'm taking only Flonase, Ortho
Tri-Cyclen and an occasional Advil.</TE>
<TE>   A: In the past, we asked herb expert James Duke, who suggested an
extract of chaste tree berry (Vitex agnus-castus). Vitex has a
progesterone-like effect.</TE>
<TE>   As you might guess from the name, folklore holds that these
berries, once called monks' pepper, can lower libido. Although there
is no science to support this belief, progesterone can interfere with
normal sex drive. Please check with your doctor before adding this
hormone-like herb to your birth control pills.</TE>

<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>And now a word about daylight saving time, fitness and spending an
hour or two with your kid.</LD>
<LD>   At our house, morning is not a good time for exercise, unless the
pandemonium of getting out the door qualifies. I'd be rich if I had a
buck for every time "It's already 7:15" was uttered under our roof.
And after our two teenagers are deposited at their respective
schools, my wife and I still have to make our own dashes for the
office.</LD>
<LD>   Until now, evening hasn't been great for exercise either, on
account of darkness. I'm not one of those folks who like to adorn
themselves with blinking lights for a run at night. I'm the one who
nearly hits them on the drive home from work.</LD>
<TE>   But now, blessedly, daylight saving time is upon us. When I got
home the other day, there was still plenty of sunshine left for a
hike. For company, I recruited my son, Nick. We had not been hiking
for some time, mostly because of hectic schedules and the fact that
darkness had almost always fallen by the time I arrived home. When
such an opportunity does occur, it is time well spent because hiking
provides the combination of exercise and uninterrupted time to talk
and catch up.</TE>
<TE>   We headed for the mountains, which isn't nearly as exotic as it
sounds. The San Gabriel Mountains are the northern boundary of Los
Angeles, the view from thousands of windows. There are abundant
hiking trails throughout Southern California, some more challenging
than others but almost all easily accessible. They range, for
example, from paths deep into the Angeles National Forest to places
such as the Hollywood Reservoir or El Moro Canyon, just north of
Laguna Beach.</TE>
<TE>   For our hike, we simply drove up Arcadia's Santa Anita Avenue
until we came to the Angeles National Forest. In five minutes, the
San Gabriel Valley was far below us. In five minutes more, the valley
had disappeared, replaced by steep mountains on all sides. After a
series of switchbacks we were at Chantry Flat, the starting point for
any number of hiking trails through the mountains and one of the most
beautiful settings in Big Santa Anita Canyon. This, less than 20
miles from downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   We parked at Kim Kelly's pack mule station, where several donkeys
were loaded with lumber destined for a cabin deep in the forest.
Kelly is relatively new to the business, but the station has been a
gathering place for locals since the Great Depression. The mules are
the only way to get large amounts of supplies and equipment to the
80-odd cabins that are tucked away in the canyon. None of them has
electricity or running water, and some were built more than 100 years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   So we set off, both of us wearing heart rate monitors. Nick was
wearing the basic model I'd bought several years ago that only
registers heartbeats per minute. I was wearing the fancier version
that also measures things like calories expended. According to
calculations that come with the monitor, my maximum heart rate is
167, while Nick's is 207. These numbers are arrived at by subtracting
your age from 220.</TE>
<TE>   So off we went, with Nick's monitor registering 99 and mine at
102. We were headed for Sturtevant Falls, a scenic four-mile round
trip that is only difficult at the end, when the trail back to
Chantry Flat is very steep. Very early in the hike, just as we
entered the lush forest of giant alders, we came upon a sign that
said, "Take care of the land. Someday, you'll be part of it."</TE>
<TE>   We eased into a comfortable pace on the trail, which parallels a
boulder-strewn stream. We crossed paths with a fisherman, who said
he'd had no luck that day. And we passed a cabin with a sheet of
plywood over one of its windows. The last time I'd been on the trail,
the window had been smashed open, the cabin burglarized.</TE>
<TE>   We talked of various things as we walked, including school and
sports and how the day had gone for both of us. And we occasionally
looked at our heart rate monitors. On a bit of an uphill climb, mine
registered 144, a few ticks over my optimum. Nick's was a steady 125.
No surprises there. He plays a lot of sports and, more to the point,
has a school gym teacher who works his students hard every day.</TE>
<TE>   When we got to the falls, which towered 50 feet above us, I
checked my monitor again. After two miles of walking, I'd expended
389 calories. We rested for a few minutes and headed back, retracing
a trail that led us over three stream crossings. Then we started the
steep climb at the end of the trail. My heart rate climbed to 165 and
Nick's went to 166, though he showed no sign of fatigue.</TE>
<TE>   "You OK?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," I replied, though I could feel the strain in my legs. We
stopped once to rest briefly before reaching the top of the hill.
When I checked the monitor, it said I'd used up 859 calories in one
hour and 19 minutes of walking. It also said I had been in my
zone--the optimum heart rate--for almost 50 minutes, a record for me.</TE>
<TE>   We didn't dally at Chantry Flat but hopped in the car and went
down the mountain. My daughter was in a high school track meet, and I
thought we might still have time to get there before she ran. And the
sun was still shining.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>

<LD>Calcium is one of the most important nutrients for kids, but too many
of them don't get enough of it.</LD>
<LD>   More than half of American children and teens have diets that are
lacking in this nutrient, experts say, putting them at risk for
serious health problems. Long-term low calcium intake is linked to an
increase in broken bones, dental problems and weaker bones later in
life (called osteoporosis).</LD>
<LD>   "Your bones are like a bank account. You can put in the biggest
deposits in terms of building bones, up until the age of 18. After
that, all your body does is make withdrawals," says Joan Carter, a
registered dietitian and instructor with the Children's Nutrition
Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to building strong bones and teeth, calcium helps your
muscles contract, your heart beat, your blood clot and your nerves
function.</TE>
<TE>   Children ages 4 to 8 need 800 milligrams of calcium daily; kids
from 9 to 18 require 1,300 milligrams. Dairy foods such as milk,
yogurt and cheese are an excellent source of calcium; low-fat and
nonfat products are fine, as are flavored milks.</TE>
<TE>   Some kids can't digest dairy foods, and other people choose not to
use milk products. In such cases, it's especially important to find
other sources of calcium. Some examples are calcium-fortified foods
such as soy milk and cheeses, cereals and juices, plus tofu and some
leafy vegetables. If you don't eat dairy products, a doctor or a
nutritionist can help you and your parents plan a balanced diet.</TE>
<TE>   In general, kids should get their calcium from food, rather than
from supplements intended for adults. (In fact, always check with
your doctor before taking any kind of supplement or vitamin.)</TE>
<TE>   "I discourage calcium supplements [for kids] because food offers a
banquet of nutrients," says Carter.</TE>
<TE>   Some studies suggest that dark colas may interfere with the body's
ability to absorb calcium.</TE>
<TE>   Experts also say that kids who drink sodas are losing out on
nutrients from healthier beverages. There's no question that sodas
should be regarded as an occasional treat, rather than a daily drink.</TE>

<HD>Pharmacies Stick by Nicotine Pops</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA MARSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pharmacists say they will continue to make nicotine-laced lollipops
despite a federal crackdown on the Internet sale of the
smoking-cessation aid.</LD>
<LD>   L.D. King, executive director of the International Academy of
Compounding Pharmacists, said that making nicotine-spiked products is
legal as long as pharmacists abide by the U.S. government's
regulations.</LD>
<LD>   "We've advised our members to dispense these lollipops only with a
valid prescription, to use childproof packaging, to avoid making any
claims as to the effectiveness of these products, and to use
FDA-approved ingredients," King said.</LD>
<TE>   The federal Food and Drug Administration had sent warning letters
last week to three Internet pharmacies selling nicotine lollipops and
nicotine lip balm.</TE>
<TE>   The agency said that the products were being sold without a
prescription and that they contained a form of nicotine not tested
for safety and effectiveness in smoking cessation.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the FDA said, the products didn't have warning labels or
packaging that would prohibit their use by children. The companies
have 15 days to respond to the warning letters and let the FDA know
they have complied with their request. Owners of two of the
companies, Ashland Drug in Ashland, Miss., and the Compounding
Pharmacy of Aurora, Ill., said they have stopped selling the
lollipops. The third pharmacy, Bird's Hill Pharmacy in Needham,
Mass., refused to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Compounding pharmacists operate like old-fashioned apothecaries
and formulate special prescription-only medicines.</TE>
<TE>   In the past two years, hundreds of compound pharmacists across the
country have been dispensing these nicotine-spiked lollipops as a
tool to help their customers stop smoking.</TE>
<TE>   They say these smoking-cessation aids not only curb the craving
for tobacco but also satisfy the oral fixation associated with
nicotine addiction.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Barris, owner of Pacifica Pharmacy in Torrance, a
compounding pharmacy that's been concocting the quit-smoking candies
for two years, doesn't plan on making any changes. "I'm already in
compliance, so I'm going to do what I've always done," he said. "At
the moment, I'm comfortable with that until I'm told otherwise."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sandra Smith, a freelance writer in Modesto, realized she was in a
jam last fall when her health insurer abruptly stopped selling
policies.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, 53, scoured the market for affordable coverage, but found
few options. Two large insurers turned her down for coverage because
of preexisting medical conditions: She has high blood pressure and is
overweight. She checked out a California program for people who have
trouble getting insurance because of health problems. But the Major
Risk Medical Insurance Program's policies were too expensive for her
and there was a two-year wait for coverage.</LD>
<LD>   "The situation has become desperate," Smith said. "Baby boomers
are going to be flooding the market. What are these people going to
do?"</LD>
<TE>   Smith's dilemma mirrors that faced by millions of Americans in
their 50s and early 60s. About 3.2 million Americans between the ages
of 55 and 64 lacked insurance in 2000, according to U.S. Census
figures. The people in this group, sometimes referred to as the "near
elderly," have typically been insured all their lives, but for a
variety of reasons are losing coverage just as the health problems
that come with growing older began to surface. While much of the
debate over the 40 million Americans who lack health insurance has
focused on covering children and the poor, this less visible slice of
the population has gone largely unnoticed.</TE>
<TE>   Many, like Smith, lose health coverage when they leave a job to
become self-employed. Others have lost their jobs through corporate
layoffs. Some are the younger spouses of people who are 65 or older
and who are covered for Medicare. All are too young for Medicare
themselves and some have developed health problems that make it
difficult--and expensive--for them to buy individual health policies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a rough combination, being physically in need of care,
vulnerable to corporate downsizing, and facing a market that makes it
difficult for someone in this age group to [afford] the premiums,"
says John Rother, director of policy for the AARP. Statistics paint a
troubling picture for this group in the years ahead. People ages 55
to 64 are six times more likely to get cancer as those between the
ages of 35 and 44, according to a report issued in February by the
Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health policy organization. Yet
the number of people who have no medical insurance to cover those
illnesses is expected to grow. The Commonwealth Fund, a New
York-based philanthropy, estimates that 16% of women between ages 55
and 65 are uninsured and predicts that figure will grow by at least
50% during this decade as many baby boomers hit age 55.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is exacerbated by a rapidly declining number of
employers offering medical benefits to retirees, including early
retirees and those who stay on the job to age 65 and beyond. Fewer
than one in four large employers now provide health coverage for
those retiring at 65, and a little more than one in four cover those
retiring early.</TE>
<TE>   So where does that leave the near elderly? Their calls are "one of
the most frustrating to get," says Marilyn Lozis, program manager for
Orange County's Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program.
"You don't have much to offer in the way of help."</TE>
<TE>   Programs designed to help people stay insured sometimes have the
opposite effect. Take COBRA, the federal law that says workers who
leave their jobs can retain their same health coverage for 18 months
by paying the premium themselves. But that may be difficult to do if
you've just lost your job. In California, there is the Major Risk
Medical Insurance Program, or MRMIP, but policies are expensive: for
example, a typical 56-year-old living in Los Angeles County would
have to pay from $5,000 to $12,000 a year, depending on the type of
plan. Insurance companies, of course, sell individual policies.
However, most states allow insurers to deny coverage for the very
health conditions for which people require medical care. No insurer
wants to sell property insurance to cover a house that's already on
fire. The same applies to medical coverage.</TE>
<TE>   As for Smith, the Modesto writer, she finally found a way to get
insurance by setting up a partnership with a fellow freelancer that
gave her access to a group policy with more affordable premiums. She
bought a PPO plan costing $267 a month. That arrangement, though,
won't work for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of universal health insurance that would spread the
cost of providing care over the young, old, healthy and sick, the
sensible solution would be to let the near elderly "buy-in" to
Medicare. Using their money, people could buy Medicare coverage and
get the same benefits now available to those older than 65,
presumably at less cost than private insurance policies. If
low-income people needed help paying the premiums, some type of
government subsidy might be available. But members of Congress are
deeply divided over expanding government programs, and there's the
issue of money and other spending priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Given the current lack of options for the near elderly, it is
important that anyone considering early retirement look into the
health insurance programs before making a decision to leave their
jobs. Many of us may be in this predicament some day.</TE>

<LD>   www.herbmed.org</LD>
<LD>   Background: HerbMed is a catalog of herbal medicine maintained by
the Alternative Medicine Foundation, a Potomac, Md., nonprofit
devoted to integrating Western and complementary healing techniques.
The Web site is aimed at both consumers and doctors who have
questions about the track records of medicinal herbs.</LD>
<TE>   What Works: The site covers many of the herbs found in
over-the-counter preparations--St. John's wort, echinacea, saw
palmetto, sassafras--listing the clinical trials and side effects of
each, with links to abstracts of the relevant studies and a
discussion of "ethnobotanical use" (folk remedy uses). The
information is presented without judgment, but the site could be more
consumer-friendly: The content is highly technical, with plant genus
names mixed freely with biochemical jargon. Yet in an area of
medicine swimming in healing myths and snake oil, the hard science is
refreshing.</TE>

<HD>Can Millions of Statistics Be Wrong?</HD>
<DH>Data* If information on maladies is to be believed, every
American has some medical woe. Or perhaps some health product maker
has exaggerated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CRAIG STOLTZ</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Newspapers receive plenty of health information, and much of it is
not to be trusted. That's because a great deal of the material is
designed to promote products that treat various medical conditions.
Often these pitches helpfully include estimates of how many people
suffer from the condition the product treats.</LD>
<LD>   Often these numbers smell funny.</LD>
<LD>   Let's assume the U.S. Census Bureau estimates are correct, and
stipulate that the population of Americans 16 and older (the group
usually cited, or at least implied, in the marketing materials) is
around 215 million.</LD>
<TE>   Now consider that, if various marketers' claims are correct, 60
million of these people have symptoms of GERD (an uptown name for
heartburn), 80 million of them "suffer" (their word) from hereditary
hair loss, 44 million have either osteoporosis or low bone density
and 28 million have migraines. These figures almost add up to the
entire U.S. adult population. Which could mean that every U.S. adult
has one of these four conditions. Every single one of us is either
going bald or having heartburn, on the verge of breaking a bone or
having a terrible headache.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's also reasonable to assume that some individuals
have multiple maladies--that some large percentage is suffering from
hair loss and heartburn, say, and maybe fragile bones too. This would
mean at least a few adults have none of those four conditions,
something common sense would suggest.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, these calculations don't allow for the 76 million
Americans who get food-borne illnesses every year, the 50 million
sidelined by motion sickness, the 43 million who have foot problems
(usually because of bad shoes), the 28 million who risk skin cancer
by spending time in tanning booths or the 20 million who, often
secretly, carry the human papillomavirus, which can cause cervical
cancer. These groups equal the size of the entire U.S. adult
population too.</TE>
<TE>   Again, let's assume that, instead of every U.S. adult having at
least two of the nine conditions already mentioned, high users of
disease have several. Perhaps members of the
hair-loss-heartburn-fragile-bone group also spend time in tanning
booths, carry the virus and maybe have sore feet. So now we're led to
think that there is a large population of U.S. adults that's pretty
much falling to pieces, the rest maybe having just one or two of
these maladies.</TE>
<TE>   And yet we've said nothing about the 43 million who have arthritis
symptoms (but can remain undiagnosed), the 100 million Americans who
suffer with mild dental irregularities (but, sadly, often don't think
they need braces), the 20 million who have kidney or urinary tract
diseases, another 20 million who have asthma, 18 million who have
sleep apnea and 10 million who carry the TB virus. That's another
full head count of U.S. adults. Add the 140 million who will suffer
from chronic, recurring bad breath, and the 32 million with COPD
(serious chronic breathing problems) and you've covered over
three-quarters of the same folks again.</TE>
<TE>   But let's not forget the 64 million who have allergies, 58 million
with high blood pressure, 43 million who have social anxiety, 30
million who have chronic sinusitis, 15 million who suffer from TMJ
(that misaligned jaw thing) and 15 million with diabetes. That covers
the whole group again.</TE>
<TE>   Just the 172 million with gum disease and the 64 million with
herpes pave the whole field over one more time.</TE>
<TE>   Add up all these figures--a mere trickle of the data flood that
swamps our offices over a couple months--and you get enough diseases
and conditions to guarantee every U.S. adult at least half a dozen of
them.</TE>
<TE>   The better guess is that at least some of the figures cited here
are extremely generous extrapolations by drug and health product
marketing people trying to lasso as many souls as they can into a
customer group. Less diplomatically, they are intentional distortions
designed to gain market share or boost a stock price.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, even if you cut some of those huge numbers in half to
account for exaggeration, overly generous definitions of the
condition and pure guesswork, the figures suggest Americans to be
wheezy, achy, irritated, nauseated, itching, virulent, anxious,
myopic folks with lousy teeth, bad breath, sick tummies and bum
backs.</TE>
<TE>   Which makes it a small miracle, I think, that only 18 million of
us, if the figures can be trusted, suffer from depression.</TE>

<HD>A Pill to Stretch Your Day</HD>
<DH>A new drug keeps people awake with no apparent ill effects.
But is prescribing it the right thing to do?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY GOWER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has become a modern cliche: There aren't enough hours in the day.
Americans are struggling to balance work and family commitments while
trying to find time for a social life and recreation. A growing
number of supermarkets, restaurants, gyms and other businesses are
accommodating today's 24/7 culture by staying open all night. Not to
mention, of course, that the Internet never shuts down. But what if
you could do the same?</LD>
<LD>   What if you could take a pill and stretch your day--by skipping
sleep?</LD>
<LD>   That sounds like the stuff of science fiction, but a drug called
Provigil could make it possible. Studies have shown that this new
medication allows people to remain awake and attentive when their
bodies normally crave shut-eye, without suffering the unpleasant side
effects and risk of addiction associated with caffeine, amphetamines
and other stimulants.</LD>
<TE>   Researchers caution that the long-term health consequences of
avoiding slumber by taking Provigil, or any drug, aren't well
understood.</TE>
<TE>   And the makers of Provigil go out of their way to state that the
drug is strictly for patients who feel sleepy during the day due to
diagnosed medical disorders. Yet as its reputation grows, doctors may
soon find themselves faced with a difficult question: When is
sleepiness a sickness?</TE>
<TE>   "This drug is going to bring up some very interesting ethical
dilemmas," says Dr. Mark Mahowald, director of the Minnesota Regional
Sleep Disorders Center in Minneapolis and an expert on the causes of
daytime sleepiness. "Do you prescribe a stimulant medication for
someone who is intentionally sleep deprived?"</TE>
<TE>   Currently the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved
Provigil only for the treatment of one condition, narcolepsy, which
causes a sudden and uncontrollable urge to sleep. But Cephalon, the
West Chester, Pa.-based company that sells Provigil, hopes to win FDA
approval within a few years to market the drug as a pick-me-up for
people plagued by sleepiness associated with any medical condition.
Many doctors in this country already prescribe Provigil "off-label,"
that is, for conditions not approved by the FDA (which is a common
and perfectly legal practice). Those conditions include depression,
sleep apnea, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, scientists at sleep clinics across the United States
are studying whether Provigil can help those working the swing or
graveyard shift, who are sometimes diagnosed with a condition known
as "shift work disorder." Symptoms can include insomnia, headaches
and an all-around blah feeling, in addition to problems staying
focused on the job.</TE>
<TE>   For 20 years, Jane Jaegers has worked the overnight shift as a 911
dispatcher for Santa Clara County--four days a week, 9 p.m. to 7 a.m.
The San Jose resident loves the job, but her body has never adjusted
to the odd schedule. In the wee hours of the morning, Jaegers says,
her attention occasionally drifts during nonemergency calls. If she
takes them in time, caffeine pills such as Vivarin and No-Doz help,
but they leave Jaegers staring at the ceiling when she goes home and
crawls into bed. Constantly exhausted, she has seen her social life
suffer. Go to a movie? "As soon as the theater gets dark, I'm gone,"
says Jaegers, 55.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Jaegers heard that scientists at the Sleep Disorders
Clinic at Stanford University were studying Provigil, whose name is
shorthand for "promotes vigilance." She signed up right away.</TE>
<TE>   Every night before leaving for work, Jaegers takes two small
tablets--she calls them "magic pills." Because half the people
participating in the study are receiving placebo tablets, Jaegers
can't be sure she's popping Provigil. But she thinks her pills are
the real deal. "I just feel more alert," says Jaegers, who adds that
she sleeps soundly these days too. "I'm tickled with the stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Drug Is Not Classified as a Stimulant</TE>
<TE>   Provigil was developed in France in the 1970s. Although no one is
sure how it works, animal studies show that the medication--unlike
other drugs that induce wakefulness--doesn't seem to dramatically
increase levels of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with
arousal and alertness.</TE>
<TE>   Caffeine and older prescription stimulants buzz the entire central
nervous system, causing jitteriness, insomnia and other unwanted
effects. When people who use coffee or amphetamines to stay awake
finally doze off, they often remain in bed for much longer than
usual, their bodies paralyzed by the need for "rebound sleep."
Provigil, meanwhile, seems to target only the part of the brain that
keeps us awake. When its effects wear off, the user resumes a normal
sleep pattern.</TE>
<TE>   "Provigil isn't considered a stimulant per se, though it has a
wakefulness effect," says Dr. Jed Black, director of the Stanford
Sleep Disorders Clinic, who is involved in the shift-work study.
Although Black says Provigil isn't effective for all patients, it
helps many people haunted by daytime sleepiness keep on their toes.
While a few users report mild nausea, most don't feel a thing other
than awake and alert. When patients switch from older stimulants to
Provigil, says Black, they often return to his office and say, "It's
not working. I don't feel revved up." Yet tests usually show that
their ability to stay awake is much improved.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier research found that when healthy people take Provigil they
are able to stay awake and on the ball for a long, long time. For
example, a 1995 Canadian study showed that subjects taking the drug
were able to perform well on cognitive tests while remaining awake
and in good spirits for two and a half days. In another study,
published in 2000, U.S. Army helicopter pilots stayed awake for 40
hours while being called upon periodically to perform maneuvers on a
flight simulator. Unmedicated, the aviators became sloppy and made
errors in the early morning hours. But while taking Provigil during a
second 40-hour marathon, their skills and focus never wavered.</TE>
<TE>   Army psychologist John Caldwell, who conducted the latter study,
says more research is needed to determine whether dosing soldiers
with Provigil is a safe and effective way to promote alertness.
However, he says, it's possible that one day the drug could be used
"as an emergency measure to briefly overcome fatigue in 'must-do'
missions where total sleep deprivation is unavoidable."</TE>
<TE>   What About Students and Working Parents?</TE>
<TE>   But aren't many of us faced with our own "must-do missions" from
time to time? If Provigil works for soldiers and pilots, won't it do
the same for college students cramming for exams? Medical students on
36-hour rotations? Or a working parent with a sick child and a
presentation to finish for tomorrow's big meeting with potential
investors?</TE>
<TE>   Cephalon spokesman Robert Grupp emphasizes that Cephalon has no
plans to market Provigil to the all-nighter crowd. "It's not for
people who work too long," he says. "It's for people with clinical
illness." But as word spreads of Provigil's powers, it seems
inevitable that the healthy-but-harried will be intrigued.</TE>
<TE>   "Silicon Valley will go wild over this thing," says Andy Serwer, a
columnist for Fortune magazine who admits to burning a fair amount of
midnight oil when he's on deadline. Instead of swigging Jolt cola and
espresso, software designers under the gun could simply take
Provigil, which costs about $4 per pill--not much more than the price
of a double latte.</TE>
<TE>   But would executives pressure their employees to take a pill for
the team? Possibly, says Serwer, if they heard that workers at other
firms were pulling Provigil-fueled all-nighters. "You would be at a
competitive disadvantage if you didn't," he says.</TE>
<TE>   If any doctors have begun prescribing Provigil to college students
and corporate workers under the gun, they're keeping the practice
quiet. But Provigil does raise a difficult question for the medical
community. What if people who work in positions where sleepiness can
endanger themselves and others start asking their doctors for the
drug?</TE>
<TE>   Shift Workers Pose Dilemma for Doctors</TE>
<TE>   Take long-haul truckers, for instance. According to federal
regulations, they're supposed to take breaks every 10 hours. But many
drivers ignore the law, even if it means navigating an 18-wheeler
while bleary-eyed. A recent expose by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
featured an interview with one driver who admitted to being behind
the wheel of his big rig for 36 straight hours.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you give that person the medication to keep him awake and not
kill himself and a car full of people?" asks Mahowald, of the
Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center. "Or do you as a matter of
principle say, 'No, you cannot have this medication because you don't
have the proper sleep disorder'? ... Quite frankly, in the interest
of public safety, I would be tempted to give the individual stimulant
medication."</TE>
<TE>   Not all sleep experts feel that's the right choice. "I think that
becomes irresponsible," says Black. "There might be fewer accidents
on our highways, but there might also be long-term health
consequences" associated with using Provigil "that we aren't
anticipating." Black says he will only prescribe the drug to people
whose sleepiness and fatigue are caused by a medical condition or
occur as a side effect from another medication. However, Black,
Mahowald and other sleep researchers agree that it's unwise to think
Provigil or any pill will make shut-eye optional.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't understand the role sleep plays," says the Army's
Caldwell. "It's a bad idea for anyone to rely on a drug of any
description to maintain alertness."</TE>
<TE>   And yet for Jane Jaegers and other shift workers, Provigil may
mean the difference between a zombie-like existence and a normal
life. And they represent a huge potential market for Cephalon. The
number of shift workers in the United States increases 2% to 3% each
year, says David Mitchell, a spokesman for Circadian Technologies, a
Lexington, Mass., company that advises firms that want to convert to
24/7 operation.</TE>
<TE>   The nationwide shift-work study should be completed by the end of
this year. If the results are promising, perhaps Provigil will one
day be found in the medicine cabinets of police officers,
firefighters, nurses and other people who work nights. And if that
happens, what's to stop the son of a shift worker from asking, "Hey,
Dad, I've got a history final on Tuesday--can I bum a Provigil?"</TE>
<TE>   Then again, maybe Junior won't bother asking--the medication is on
sale through Internet-based pharmacies based overseas, often marketed
as a "smart drug."</TE>
<TE>   In "Faster: The Acceleration of Just About Everything" (Vintage,
2000), author James Gleick writes about our changing notion of time.
Reached by e-mail, he was dubious about using a drug to lengthen our
days. "In a time-obsessed age, this is the Holy Grail," said Gleick.
"Cheating sleep is the closest thing we have to cheating death."
However, until scientists better understand the phenomenon known as
sleep, he was quick to add, "Beware of miracles."</TE>

<HD>More Troubles for Supplement</HD>
<DH>Study * Researchers found PC SPES, a blend of Chinese
botanicals, to have traces of estrogenic, anti-inflammatory drugs as
well as blood thinner.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aherbal supplement recently pulled from store shelves because it
contained traces of a prescription blood thinner also was
contaminated with two other drugs, a detailed analysis has shown.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers from UC San Diego, Rational Therapeutics of Long Beach
and two other institutions discovered diethylstilbestrol, or DES, in
the supplement as well as the blood thinner warfarin and the
anti-inflammatory drug indo- methacin. The study examined samples of
PC SPES manufactured from 1996 to 2001.</LD>
<LD>   DES has highly potent estrogenlike properties that could explain
the apparent effectiveness of PC SPES in reducing tumor growth in men
who had failed other types of prostate cancer therapy, the
researchers reported.</LD>
<TE>   When applied to cancer cells in a test tube, the study showed that
the highest degree of biological activity was in samples of PC SPES
that contained the highest concentrations of DES. Use of DES is
associated with side effects such as breast enlargement, hot flashes
and nausea.</TE>
<TE>   The study, undertaken by doctors interested in the remedy's
apparent effectiveness, was reported last week at the annual meeting
of the American Assn. for Cancer Research in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the California Department of Health Services
requested a recall of PC SPES after its testing revealed
contamination with warfarin. PC SPES, which is a blend of eight
Chinese herbs, is made by BotanicLab in Brea.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for BotanicLab, John Sonego, said the company was
surprised by the new study showing three contaminants in the product.</TE>
<TE>   "Our testing, and testing from independent researchers, didn't
find DES," says Sonego. "The Department of Health Services testing
didn't find anything but warfarin."</TE>
<TE>   Chemists at BotanicLab believe the warfarin detected in PC SPES
could actually be a naturally occurring compound called
phytocoumarin, which is found in more than 300 green plants and has
characteristics similar to warfarin, Sonego said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Sonego said Botanic- Lab is revamping its manufacturing
process to avoid future contamination. The measures include
establishing an improved quality control system, switching raw herb
suppliers and moving the manufacturing facilities from Brea to China.</TE>
<TE>   He said the company does not know how contamination might have
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was a contamination problem, we believe it was with the
suppliers in China," Sonego said. "One of the things this whole issue
did for us is made us realize that when you are importing ingredients
from China, you have to be really careful about quality."</TE>
<TE>   The company plans to submit new samples of PC SPES to the
Department of Health Services soon in order to obtain permission to
resume sales.</TE>

<HD>Vitamin Packets: Take With Caution</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENEDICT CAREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They hang on racks beside key chains at gas stations and crowd the
candy bars at convenience stores: little packets full of pills
promising a day's dose of energy, stamina and good health.</LD>
<LD>   "You're there with your coffee and Danish, maybe you had a bad
night, and you say, 'I'll try one of these,'" said Patrick Rea,
director of natural product research at Nutrition Business Journal in
San Diego. "It's an impulse buy," he adds, and "you're not even
thinking much about what's in it.''</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps you should, doctors say. The contents of daily supplement
packets vary widely: Some products, with names like Xtra-Energy and
MINI Natural, contain ephedrine, the amphetamine-like stimulant in
diet and sports products that some doctors have linked to heart
palpitations, stroke, cardiac arrest and sudden death. Others contain
mostly vitamins and minerals--sometimes in heavy dosages.</LD>
<TE>   Many combine vitamins with a list of natural extracts that could
be taken from a Harry Potter novel: hawthorn berry, bissy nut, yellow
dock, dong quai, fo-ti root, ashwaganda, yerba mate--you get the
idea.</TE>
<TE>   "They come up with all these combinations for which there's no
evidence whatsoever that they do much of anything," said Dr. Joyce
Lashof, professor emeritus of public health at UC Berkeley. "Hawthorn
berry--honestly, who really knows what that's doing in the body?"</TE>
<TE>   A daily-packet dose certainly can wake you up, pharmacists say,
even if there's no ephedrine in it. Dr. Michael Wincor, an associate
professor at the USC School of Pharmacy, said several of the herbal
extracts commonly found in packets contain caffeine. Depending on the
preparation, he said, the packets may contain the equivalent of up to
two cups of coffee. "There's your energy boost right there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, because dietary supplements makers don't have to prove their
products to be effective or safe, many doctors are skeptical of them.
Even essential vitamins such as A and D can cause health problems
over time if taken in large doses, Lashof said.</TE>
<TE>   In studies among more than 25,000 people during the early 1990s,
researchers found that high doses of beta carotene--the plant form of
vitamin A--appeared to increase the risk of lung cancer in smokers.
There's no good evidence that beta carotene supplements cause health
problems in nonsmokers. Some companies that sell the daily packets
insist that their products are safe and effective. Fresh Start
Vitamin Co. of Carson claims to have sold some 700 million vitamin
and herb packets without receiving a complaint more serious than a
mild allergic reaction, said a company spokesman, who asked not to be
named.</TE>
<TE>   He said the company's products, which contain no ephedrine, are
regularly tested for purity and dosage, offer a balance of vitamins
and minerals, and are distributed at some military bases, fire and
police departments.</TE>
<TE>   The Fresh Start "Herbal Energy Tablets" contain such ingredients
as wu chi root (thought to soothe menstrual cramps, among other
things); fo-ti root (said to boost circulation); and mullein
(anti-inflammatory properties).</TE>
<TE>   Vivi Ann Keene, chief executive of Uptime Sports Nutrition in
Santa Barbara, said she is unaware of any major customer complaints
during some 20 years of selling supplement packets. Uptime makes a
variety of preparations, none with ephedrine, which contain vitamins,
minerals and herbs.</TE>
<TE>   "We have many very loyal customers," she said, "and what we always
say is, if someone is worried about a product, or they have an
illness, they should take the product to their doctor first."</TE>
<TE>   There are several extracts in the company's Uptime Herbal packet
that Keene had to look up when asked about them, including dong quai
(for menstrual problems, among other things) and ligustrum (thought
to stimulate the immune system).</TE>
<TE>   Doctors say it's not clear yet whether most of these substances
reliably boost immune response, or circulation, or prevent disease,
or whether the dosages in supplements are enough to induce those
effects. But insofar as the herbs are active in the body, they can
also have side effects.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmacists say mullein may cause skin inflammation if used
topically, and drowsiness; yellow dock can induce abdominal pain and
diarrhea; dong quai may cause diarrhea, even fever.</TE>
<TE>   Some herbs may also interact with common prescription or
over-the-counter drugs. Doctors, for example, caution against taking
doses of ginkgo biloba with blood thinners such as aspirin.
Cholesterol-lowering drugs such as Lipitor and Mevacor interact with
several herbs, including gotu kola, which is taken for fatigue and
skin problems, among other things.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Dentali, vice president of scientific affairs at the
American Herbal Products Assn., a group in Silver Spring, Md., that
represents the dietary supplement industry, said he often takes
herbs.</TE>
<TE>   "But I don't take them willy-nilly," he said. "I read labels, and
if the label doesn't make sense to me, then I won't take it. If I was
looking at the label to check for sources of caffeine, for instance,
I would want to know exactly how much caffeine is there and where
it's coming from."</TE>
<TE>   But packet labels are as variable as the products: Some appear
detailed and complete; others are confusing. "The bottom line is we
really don't have any idea what's in these things, and we have no
idea how they might interact with one another," Lasher said.</TE>
<TE>   She offers a better option for getting your vitamins and minerals,
along with an energy lift: a balanced meal and a cup of strong coffee
or tea.</TE>
