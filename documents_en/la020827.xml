<HD>A Weekend for Snoozers</HD>
<DH>Unlike other holiday films, Labor Day movies are usually
stinkers that studios hope will fade away</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK GOLDSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood filmmakers can survive all sorts of slings and arrows of
misfortune, but when it comes to bad tidings, nothing stings quite as
much as the news that the studio is putting your movie out on Labor
Day weekend. In an era when holiday weekends are jammed with splashy
new releases that rocket off to box-office records, Labor Day has
become the industry's toxic waste pit, a dumping ground for the kinds
of clunkers that would challenge the skills of the best used-car
salesman.</LD>
<LD>   Over the past 15 years, less than a handful of Labor Day weekend
movies have made more than a paltry $20 million in their entire
theatrical runs. Exhibitor Relations, the firm that tracks box-office
statistics, recently compiled the top 45 holiday weekends of all
time: Labor Day made it on the list just once, with last year's tally
ranking No. 44.</LD>
<TE>   How bad have the offerings been? In 1998, the weekend's
top-grossing film was "Knock Off," featuring Jean-Claude Van Damme as
a fashion designer (!) who joins forces with a CIA agent (Rob
Schneider) to combat terrorism. In 1999, the top film was "Chill
Factor," which had Cuba Gooding Jr. and Skeet Ulrich joining forces
to stop a new biological weapon that's designed to explode if exposed
to air chilled below 50 degrees. In 1997 you could choose between
"Kull the Conqueror" with Kevin Sorbo as a barbarian battling other
barbarians to keep his throne or "Excess Baggage," which starred
Alicia Silverstone (remember her?) as a spoiled rich girl who falls
in love with a guy who steals her car.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a director and the studio puts your movie on Labor
Day," says DreamWorks marketing chief Terry Press, "you pretty much
know what they think of your movie."</TE>
<TE>   This year the pickings are as slim as ever. The only nationwide
release is "feardotcom," a horror picture that looks to be such a
stinker that Warner Bros. isn't screening the film until Wednesday
night, two days before it opens. The TV ads, packed with images of
screaming women in jeopardy and a leering Internet dominatrix, don't
mention the names of the film's actors or even display a credit box,
as if the talent had been hustled into a witness relocation program.</TE>
<TE>   But why is Labor Day the worst weekend? People still go to
baseball games and rock concerts, then why not movies? When you look
at the long list of Labor Day losers you have to wonder: Is it a bad
weekend because the studios only put bad movies on that date, or do
they put bad movies on that date because they know people won't go
anyway?</TE>
<TE>   "It's a cultural thing," explains Revolution Studios partner Tom
Sherak, who picks his studio's release dates. "It's the end of
summer, and people are distracted. Kids are going back to school,
parents have to go shopping for their kids, and everyone's mind-set
is changing from a summer of leisure to a time of hitting the books
again. Once that happens, events like movies lose their urgency, they
take a back seat to other things."</TE>
<TE>   You could argue that Labor Day is a holiday with an inherently
negative spin, with people shifting from summer fun to schoolwork and
9-to-5 drudgery. It hardly puts you in a receptive mood for a movie,
does it? But what would happen if someone put "Star Wars" on Labor
Day--would people still stay away?</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it would be an event. It would do lots of business,"
says Sherak. "But if you're not sure, why take the chance?"</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reason, expectations are low. David M. Evans, who
directed "First Kid," a 1996 comedy that was one of the
better-grossing Labor Day weekend films, says he didn't realize his
film was coming out on such a slow weekend "until I got a call over
the weekend from a studio marketing executive who told me, 'You
should be ecstatic. We did a whole lot better than we thought we
would.' "</TE>
<TE>   The industry's old pros say teenagers are the only reliable
audience who'll show up on Labor Day, which is why most releases then
are teen comedies or horror films, the two most popular teen genres.
During the 1990s, horror films were standbys, with such entries as
"Child's Play 3," "The Crow: City of Angels," "The Prophecy," "Texas
Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation" and "Highlander: Endgame."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, MGM had the biggest Labor Day hit ever with "Jeepers
Creepers," a teens-in-jeopardy horror film that took in $15 million
in its opening weekend and ended up earning nearly $38 million, both
Labor Day records. Former MGM distribution chief Larry Gleason, who
picked the film's release date, says, "If you have a picture that
primarily appeals to teens, then Labor Day is the right place to take
a shot. We needed an easy opening weekend without any real
competition to really launch the picture."</TE>
<TE>   After MGM's surprise success, you'd think Labor Day might look
slightly more enticing. But for all of the industry's devotion to
market research, when it comes to selecting opening weekends for
movies, Hollywood is a surprisingly superstitious place. If a movie
does well on a particular date, it usually encourages the studio to
release a similar movie on the same date.</TE>
<TE>   The same thinking applies for dates where films have failed.
According to conventional wisdom, the first week of December was a
dead zone. In fact, until the 1970s, business was so slow that many
theaters were closed during the first two weeks of December. The end
of the year is a popular time for female-oriented Oscar pictures, but
studio marketers say that in early December, most women are out doing
Christmas shopping. So studios target big family movies for
Thanksgiving and Oscar-oriented films for Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   For years, there wasn't a major studio release during the first
week of December. Then last year, desperate to get the jump on all
the other war movies about to hit theaters, 20th Century Fox rushed
out "Behind Enemy Lines" at the beginning of December. The movie was
a modest hit, bringing in $60 million. This year Warners has picked
Dec. 6 to release "Analyze That," a big-budget sequel to "Analyze
This" that stars Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal.</TE>
<TE>   The first weekend in October was also considered a box-office
wasteland. But in 2000, Universal used the date to launch "Meet the
Parents," which went on to be one of the year's biggest hits. Now
early October is prime time: Universal has cornered the date for "Red
Dragon," the latest installment in the Hannibal Lecter saga and a
film the studio sees as its biggest commercial release of the year.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Disney put out M. Night Shyamalan's thriller "The Sixth
Sense" in the first weekend of August. It was a mega-hit. But
Shyamalan's next film, "Unbreakable," came out at Thanksgiving and
was a box-office disappointment. So this year Disney and Shyamalan
went back to the beginning of August for "Signs," which is on track
to be another blockbuster.</TE>
<TE>   The magic doesn't always stick. For years, the first week in June
has been an auspicious date for Jerry Bruckheimer action films--the
Disney-based producer had three straight hits on the weekend with
"The Rock," "Con Air" and "Gone in 60 Seconds." But when Disney put
the Bruckheimer-produced "Bad Company" on the same date this year, it
flopped.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to imagine any of this preoccupation with release dates
registering with moviegoers. They're simply looking for good movies
to see. But this fondness for good luck charms speaks volumes about
the fragile Hollywood psyche. In a business that breeds rampant
insecurity, where runaway success is just as mysterious as abject
failure, filmmakers look for any shiny talisman that will soothe
their nerves and give them a tiny glimmer of inner peace. Directors
may forget the names of their own children, but they never forget the
release date of their hit movies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a director thing," Press says. "It's like Linus and his
blankie. In a world where everything else is unknowable, having the
same release date is comforting. It's the one constant that's
controllable. It's something you want to repeat."</TE>
<TE>   Unless your movie's coming out this weekend. Ask anyone in
Hollywood. Having a movie on Labor Day is like making a film with
Steven Seagal. It's not an experience you want to repeat.</TE>

<HD>At Almario Tribute, He Does the Honors</HD>
<DH>The Colombian-born saxman puts his versatility on display
as he receives a Jazz Pilgrimage award.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saxophonist Justo Almario received a much-deserved tribute Sunday
night at the Ford Amphitheatre when Jazz Pilgrimage 2002, a
production of the Hollywood Arts Council, selected the Colombian-born
jazz artist as its honoree of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Almario, clearly moved by the award, responded with an
extraordinary display of musicianship, performing in a small jazz
group, with Tolu (the stirring Latin jazz band he leads with drummer
Alex Acuna) and taking the lead role in the salsa-tinged sounds of
the Jazz on the Latin Side All Stars.</LD>
<LD>   His versatility was remarkable. Playing alto saxophone on a
supercharged rendering of "I'll Remember April," Almario was an
improvisational whirlwind. Tossing out bebop licks, whipping across
his instrument from top to bottom, propelling the music forward with
an inexorable sense of swing, he was a consummate straight-ahead jazz
artist.</LD>
<TE>   When he was joined by Acuna and his fellow members of Tolu, the
emphasis shifted somewhat, retaining a firm connection with jazz but
adding Latin-tinged call-and-response patterns over a surging caldron
of rhythm, enlivened by the guest-star presence of last year's Jazz
Pilgrimage honoree, percussionist Francisco Aguabella.</TE>
<TE>   Almario once again took the lead, urging the crowd to join in a
vigorous version of the title tune from the band's new album, "Bongo
de Van Gogh." Adding flute and tenor saxophone to his arsenal, his
playing thoroughly affirmed his belief in the potentially seamless
connections that can be made between the music and rhythms from
across North and South America.</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz on the Latin Side All Stars, initially organized for a
one-time-only outing by DJ Jose Rizo, have quickly emerged as one of
the Southland's most popular Latin jazz ensembles.</TE>
<TE>   Their appeal is clearly heightened by the fact that the group's
musical director, trombonist Francisco Torres, maintains an
irresistibly danceable foundation for many of the pieces.</TE>
<TE>   That was not the case for their opening number, a version of Dizzy
Gillespie's "Bebop," filled with the sort of explosive brass passages
and fiery soloing--from Almario, Torres and Acuna--that surely would
have pleased the trumpet great.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the All-Stars set wound to a close, however, salsa
rhythms had taken over, much to the pleasure of the numerous audience
members who were dancing in the aisles.</TE>
<TE>   And, even here, revealing yet another facet of his talents,
Almario soloed in a fashion that kept the jazz elements of the music
alive and the crowd happily in action.</TE>

<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Sept. 11 terror attacks had two concrete effects on the business
of television news. One was that "NBC Nightly News" anchor Tom Brokaw
decided that he wasn't yet ready to give up his anchor chair as he
had been contemplating, and he signed a new contract to remain as
NBC's lead anchor through 2004. The other was the appearance of the
now-ubiquitous "news crawl" at the bottom of everything from the
cable news networks to E! Entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   The rest of the fallout from that day is much fuzzier.</LD>
<LD>   The nightly newscasts of the broadcast networks now have more
viewers, after years of falling ratings. News divisions gained
renewed respect of corporate bosses who perhaps hadn't been fully
appreciative of the role played by units that don't always return the
highest profit margins. Extra budget money was found for the
unexpected costs of war coverage, a trend that will continue for a
second fiscal year, as the networks anticipate the possibility of
having to cover military action in Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   But the reminder of the importance that televised news can play
didn't stop one corporate owner, ABC's Walt Disney Co., from flirting
with the idea of doing away with one of the medium's most serious
news programs, the single-subject, late-night "Nightline," when the
network thought it could lure David Letterman from CBS.</TE>
<TE>   As for the cable news universe, CNN decided its mission would
henceforth be serious news. "I think Sept. 11 showed us that the
world really matters and covering it in a straight and honest way is
a good mission to have," said Walter Isaacson, CNN News Group
chairman. "It's reinvigorated us and allowed us to follow our
passion, which is journalism."</TE>
<TE>   Audiences had other ideas, however. While all cable networks have
more viewers than a year ago, audiences have favored Fox News
Channel, which pursues an opposite strategy; its schedule is filled
with opinion-laced shows that more closely resemble talk radio. It
surged into first place among cable news networks several months
after the attacks and has stayed there. That prompted MSNBC to follow
suit, with its own opinion-driven schedule. The attacks "re-energized
cable news and carved out a new audience of people so totally into
this story," said NBC News President Neal Shapiro.</TE>
<TE>   CNN, too, despite Isaacson's high-minded ambitions, has recently
veered toward more talk and high-spirited debates.</TE>
<TE>   In the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, which followed a frenzied
August 2001 of shark stories and rampant speculation about the
private life of Rep. Gary Condit, TV news rushed to embrace serious
topics and the foreign news that had previously been shunted aside.
Networks competed to see who had the most personnel and equipment in
the Afghanistan region. CNN went so far as to send lengthy daily
e-mails to print reporters who write about television, listing the
whereabouts of every CNN correspondent in a vast swath of the Mideast
and the highlights of what they had said on air during the day.</TE>
<TE>   But as the attacks receded, other news crept in. The bombing in
Afghanistan became the daily routine, and stories of financial
scandal at Enron and elsewhere competed for air time. MSNBC cut back
on reports from NBC News correspondents in the field and hired a
stable of talk hosts. Cable networks filled their summer days with
running reports on child kidnappings; the network morning news shows
scrapped for two escaped kidnap victims as guests.</TE>
<TE>   One recent Monday, a CNN anchor read a report plugging CNN's
first-place finish in a new study on media credibility in the year
since the Sept. 11 attacks. Then she turned to the movie "Signs" and
read e-mails from viewers weighing in on whether they believe complex
patterns found in crop fields are paranormal occurrences.</TE>
<TE>   On cable, in particular, "we're seeing much more of a mix,
including an obsession with less important stories," said Andrew
Heyward, president of CBS News. "To a degree, that's reassuring,
because it's a barometer of America getting back to normal....
Obsession with unimportant things is a luxury."</TE>
<TE>   CNN's Isaacson, testily running down an exhaustive list of one
recent day's reports from overseas, said fluffy stories are the
exception. "You'll catch us doing something at some point," he said,
but he insisted that "we're more hard news than any other network,
and we do more hard news than we did before Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of the summer, CNN executives gathered at
Isaacson's Atlanta home, he said, "and we talked very openly about
whether we wanted to pursue a more opinion format or stick closer to
hard news and journalism." Journalism won out, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there was a very strong feeling that post-Sept. 11 we
should reemphasize our core mission, which is reporting from around
the world." Although executives "worried about would it be cheaper
and easier to get ratings by another approach, I don't think anybody
really argued for that," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcasters, too, said the attacks helped them hone what their
priorities should be. "The biggest effect is almost in the way we
perceive ourselves," said ABC News President David Westin. Before
Sept. 11, "as devoted as many of us were to the news, we had a lot of
questions raised in our minds about 'what is our future, should we
chase after this or that competitor,' " he said, and covering the
attacks and the aftermath was "clarifying. One cannot be all things
to all people, and the fact that someone else is doing something and
succeeding doesn't mean we have to chase after them."</TE>
<TE>   "I do think there's been an increased seriousness and an awareness
of the fact that most Americans were blindsided by 9/11," says Ken
Waters, a journalism professor at Pepperdine University. "But the
media did a lousy job of explaining to people that maybe we're the
most powerful country, but not the most popular. Certainly the rise
of radical Islam is a complex issue, and TV news is not the best
medium to explain it.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be said [TV news is] increasing coverage. My question is,
so what? ... If you fly reporters in from Europe to cover news in
Africa or the Middle East, or fly Tom Brokaw in with Jerusalem in the
background, that's simply entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   Ever the academic, Waters concludes: "I'd give them a C. There's
an awareness of a need, and some attempts to improve. But I think
they have a ways to go."</TE>
<TE>   For networks and print journalists, the attacks brought about a
realization that some stories had simply been overlooked, such as the
rise of Islamic fundamentalism, said NBC's Shapiro. They also
"starkly illuminated for people that the world is more interdependent
than many viewers ever thought, and can have a direct, powerful
influence on the lives--and deaths--of Americans who thought they
were safe and secure in our borders." He said that has made the
audience "more willing to watch some stories they might have said,
pre-9/11, are 'not about me.' "</TE>
<TE>   Still, network newscasts, too, have worked lighter features into
their 22 minutes. "To the extent that news programs are a mix of the
obligatory and discretionary, a year later there is more leeway for
the discretionary," Heyward said. "But at least at CBS, many more
stories than a year ago are devoted to issues that come out of the
terrorism attacks. The story continues to reverberate in many places,
and that's reflected in the mix."</TE>
<TE>   He argued, however, that the attacks didn't provoke any "huge
philosophical change, because I think the networks were more
responsible than people gave us credit for before." Rather, he said,
covering the story "was a tremendous challenge for the networks, for
all journalists, and I think we rose to the challenge. It was a
reminder to everyone of what's important ... and reminded everyone in
this increasingly diverse and eclectic media landscape there is still
a big place for networks."</TE>

<HD>The Summer of Lost Brain Cells</HD>
<DH>Dolt-fests are everywhere on TV, drawing large numbers of
benumbed viewers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's one theory: Something in the devices the Nielsen ratings
people attach to U.S. television sets is causing inadvertent
lobotomies. Here's another: We reached our evolutionary peak this
past spring, and the summer is the beginning of what will be an
apparently rapid decline.</LD>
<LD>   Or maybe it's only that American culture has given up. We'll never
be as clever or as cosmopolitan as the Europeans, so we've reached a
collective, unconscious decision to surrender to our inner morons.
Whatever you would hold responsible (were your brain still engaged
enough for such high-level thinking), this is, undeniably,
television's Summer of Dumb.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly, less than a year removed from Sept. 11 and its
predictions of a coming era of high-mindedness, dolt-fests are
everywhere on the tube, and they are, almost all of them, dumbly
drawing boatloads of benumbed viewers. Statistical probability
suggests few, if any, of these people are watching with guns to their
heads. Ordinary Americans are swarming voluntarily to such
celebrations of cerebral vacancy as "Dog Eat Dog," "American Idol"
and "The Anna Nicole Show."</LD>
<TE>   They're watching the blatant rip-off (of the movie "Meet the
Parents") that is the dumb reality show "Meet My Folks," which in
turn witlessly uses its air time to advertise another shameless "Meet
the Parents" idea-swipe, the dumb upcoming sitcom "The In-Laws."
There are even people unrelated to any of the contestants who are
watching "Big Brother 3," the I.Q.-savaging series that provides the
obvious answer to the question of what happens when you cram vain
dullards into a camera-laden house. That answer: not the discovery of
a cure for cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The networks, especially NBC and Fox, have finally learned the
lesson of "Survivor" and "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," two hits
that debuted in summer: There is an audience then that is ready to
embrace new material. Unfortunately for all of us, what's being
offered also gives a bear hug to the old theory that you'll never go
broke underestimating the intelligence of the public.</TE>
<TE>   Now, I know what you're saying. Relax, dude. It's summer. This
spate of empty-headed reality programming is just a little harmless
diversion. So what if we finally have, after years of nothing but
reruns during the balmy season, the television equivalent of beach
reading? Bullfeathers. TV, never a meeting place for Mensa members,
now has people flocking to their sets to see an apparently chemically
stupefied Anna Nicole Smith simulating sex on a bed, talking to her
intelligent teen son as if he's a toddler and giving her
court-awarded half of the cremains of her deceased octogenarian
billionaire husband a tour of her new home.</TE>
<TE>   My point is that these programs cannot be apologized away as
guilty pleasures. They won't have any effect on the fall season,
which was already locked in place by the time they gained success.
But let this kind of participant-debasing, brain-cell-consuming
material gain a foothold, even in summer, and the next thing you
know, instead of three "Law &amp; Orders" and a "West Wing," we'll have
an endless succession of low-talent talent shows and frantic contests
that end with pies in faces and pants on backward. An exaggeration?
Consider where we are already.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's "Dog Eat Dog," a top-10 summer show, pits its cast of Joes
so regular you wouldn't trust them to spell "Joe" against one another
in anti-intellectual feats of mulish strength and bovine humiliation
endurance. The show's fear factor, to borrow the title of a
dumb-but-popular NBC show of longer standing, is the in-studio pool,
a terrifying thing to creatures such as the Neanderthals who didn't
understand that we two-legged types can, you know, swim.</TE>
<TE>   The contestants, who frequently wear little on top to take
attention away from the word combinations that come out of their
mouths, alternate between dimwitted taunting of one another and
equally dimwitted (and insincere) cheering as they try to avoid
landing in this glorified dunk tank. Then, at show's end, the victor
risks having his win nullified if his vanquished rivals can answer a
series of trivia questions that wouldn't stump a struggling
third-grader.</TE>
<TE>   Often, they cannot handle even these queries.</TE>
<TE>   "Who is the current prime minister of the United Kingdom?" asks
the host, the perpetually lingerie-clad Brooke Burns. "Thatcher,"
answers the contestant, in the year 2002. (The answer, as it has been
for years, is Tony Blair.) Ex-"Baywatch" babe Burns reads cue cards
as if to an English-as-a-second-language class. But "Dog Eat Dog"
ranks low in the summer's top 10. Higher up, in ratings and buzz, is
"American Idol," Fox's blockheaded version of a high school talent
show. If you believe the hype, "Idol" is a sensation. It's a summer
wonder. It's a national obsession.</TE>
<TE>   It's dumb.</TE>
<TE>   What could be less intelligent than having Paula Abdul, for
Pavarotti's sake, pass judgment on other people's singing? Or a
studio audience that boos when "mean" judge Simon Cowell tells the
inexplicably long-lived contestant Nikki McKibbin that she is out of
her depth? Hey, people, guess what? She is, even in a shallow pool.
And she needs to hear it now, so that she can go ahead and get a
regular job.</TE>
<TE>   The show is so dumb that three of the 10 finalists bore
phonetically simplified first names: "EJay," "A.J." and "R.J."And,
dumbest of all, the show's popularity-contest voting resulted in the
most talented singer, Tamyra Gray, being voted off last week. Nikki
and Justin Guarini remain, which is like voting off Whitney Houston
but keeping, say, Paula Abdul. It's not even smart to say this show
is a huge hit. Yes, 13 million viewers in summer is a pretty big
number; that is, after all, a 13 with six zeroes after it. But it's
still losing in the ratings to reruns of "CSI" and "Everybody Loves
Raymond." It's a moderate hit.</TE>
<TE>   CBS' "Big Brother" gets dumber and dumber with every passing year,
brought back perhaps only to keep its host, slumming newsreader Julie
Chen, in prime-time work.</TE>
<TE>   What could be less mentally taxing than watching indolent people
with nothing to do but whisper secrets to one another, apparently too
dumb to realize that the microphones are picking up every word?</TE>
<TE>   NBC's "Meet My Folks" gives us a scenario in which three guys,
usually, come to a gal's house for a weekend, and her parents learn
revealing things about them en route to picking one to go spend a
week in Hawaii with her. It could instead be called, "Pimps, My
Folks." And so it ends up, like most TV dating shows, with smarmy
people dating smarmy people. That's a form, I suppose, of natural
selection, a theory I used to think I understood before I started
watching all this Summer 2002 TV.</TE>

<LD>POP/ROCK</LD>
<LD>   Another Hit Record</LD>
<LD>   for the Late Eva Cassidy</LD>
<TE>   The bittersweet success of Eva Cassidy's music continues.</TE>
<TE>   The Maryland singer, whose music ranges from standards and pop to
jazz and folk, was a relative unknown when she died in 1996 at age
33, but her music has found a widening audience in subsequent years,
largely through word of mouth. On Monday, "Imagine," a new set of 10
previously unreleased tracks, debuted at No. 1 on the U.K. album
chart, marking the second time one of her posthumous releases has
topped that list.</TE>
<TE>   Cassidy's success in England has been considerable--her music is a
staple request of BBC listeners, who also voted her version of "Over
the Rainbow" as one of the 100 best musical performances of the 20th
century.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine" debuts on the U.S. chart Wednesday but is not expected
to crack the top 10. Her other titles, including "Songbird" and "Time
After Time," also still sell well--last week alone they sold 22,000
copies in the U.S., and her career U.S. total to date is 1.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Cassidy's first solo album, "Live at Blues Alley," was released in
June 1996. Two months later, her melanoma was diagnosed and she died
by year's end. Her life is now the subject of a coffee-table book by
two British writers, and there has been talk of a film version.</TE>

<TE>   Patti LaBelle: Ashanti</TE>
<TE>   Is 'Extremely Deserving'</TE>
<TE>   Ashanti didn't directly mention the controversy surrounding her
special award at the eighth annual Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards
over the weekend, but she got support from Patti LaBelle, who
presented the entertainer of the year honor to the 21-year-old
newcomer.</TE>
<TE>   Ashanti is "extremely deserving of this wonderful recognition,"
LaBelle said, adding "her overall success of the past year exceeds
those of all other female solo artists or groups."</TE>
<TE>   More than 28,000 signatures had been gathered on an Internet
petition saying Ashanti didn't deserve the award.</TE>
<TE>   In ceremonies at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium Saturday, Ashanti
also was selected as best new solo artist. Other winners included the
late singer Aaliyah, whose single "Rock the Boat" was named best R&amp;B
solo single and song of the year, and Destiny's Child, which won best
R&amp;B/soul album of the year for "Survivor" and best R&amp;B single for
"Emotion."</TE>
<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   A Rare Budget Deficit</TE>
<TE>   for Cleveland Orchestra</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland Orchestra, still considered by many the nation's
finest, has announced its first substantial budget deficit in almost
a decade: $1.3 million for the fiscal year that ended May 31.</TE>
<TE>   During the 2001-02 season, when the orchestra's budget was $34.6
million, its income fell $2.7 million short of its goal. That deficit
was reduced to $1.3 million by cutting planned operating expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra's executive director, Thomas Morris, blamed the bad
news on an ailing stock market and a 29% decline in corporate
contributions. The value of the orchestra's endowment, one of the
largest for U.S. orchestras, fell from $155 million in 2000 to $105
million this month, primarily due to stock market losses.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2002-03 season, the orchestra will cut its expenses,
including some radio broadcasts and benefits for employees, but will
not substantially reduce its core programs. It has canceled a taping
of a Sept. 14 gala concert marking the debut of the orchestra's new
music director, Franz Welser-Most, and a tour to Carnegie Hall
scheduled for this season.</TE>

<TE>   Denver Art Museum Making Do With Less</TE>
<TE>   The Denver Art Museum will proceed with an ambitious exhibition
schedule as well as construction of a new wing despite revenue
shortfalls that have forced it to cut 10% of the full-time staff.</TE>
<TE>   The museum also will rotate the permanent exhibitions it keeps
open late Wednesday nights instead of having them all open. The goal
is to cut $1 million from its $14-million budget.</TE>
<TE>   "This will not impact the special exhibition program or other
programs and services," museum director Lewis Sharpe said. "We are
going forward with probably our most ambitious exhibition ever from
the Phillips Impressionist collection in Washington." The exhibition
is scheduled to open Oct. 4, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Nor will the budget cuts affect the ongoing construction of a
$62.5-million wing designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, to be
funded by voter-approved bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts become effective Oct. 1, the start of the 2002-03 fiscal
year. The full-time staff will drop from 164 to 148 people.</TE>

<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Nance, KNBC-TV's morning weathercaster, is on an
indefinite paid leave of absence pending an investigation into a
personnel matter. Station executives refused to comment about the
inquiry. John Stehlin will fill in during Nance's absence.... Singer
Joey McIntyre, a former member of the group New Kids on the Block,
will join the Fox series "Boston Public" this season, playing a new
member of the faculty.... Marc Anthony and Carlos Vives will perform
on the third annual Latin Grammy Awards telecast on CBS Sept. 18.</TE>

<HD>L.A.'s Warhol Boost</HD>
<DH>A study due out today says the MOCA retrospective, which
ended Aug. 18, added $55.8 million to the local economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andy Warhol isn't Vincent Van Gogh, but he still packs some
box-office punch. An economic impact study on the Museum of
Contemporary Art's "Andy Warhol Retrospective," to be released today,
concludes that the highly publicized exhibition, which ended a
12-week run on Aug. 18, pumped $55.8 million into Los Angeles'
economy.</LD>
<LD>   That's less than half the $121.9 million generated by "Van Gogh's
Van Goghs" during its longer, 17-week run in 1999 at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art. "Warhol" also fell short of the $130 million
predicted by Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp., last December, when the show was announced. But
Kyser said his early estimate was made in haste "without the depth of
analysis we would like to have done." He also blamed some of the
shortfall on a reluctance to travel after the Sept. 11 attacks and
the slow economy.</LD>
<LD>   Still, he and representatives of the coalition that brought
"Warhol" to Los Angeles--the only American venue for the show, which
began in Berlin and moved on to London--say the study proves that the
effort paid off. Promoted by the Los Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors
Bureau and funded by corporate sponsors, private donations and a
$250,000 gift from the city, the $2.7-million exhibition produced
$550,200 in hotel and sales tax revenue for the city, more than
doubling the city's investment, Kyser noted.</LD>
<TE>   "It was great for the museum and great for the city," said Bob
Tuttle, chairman of the MOCA board of trustees. "If there was a
negative, I can't tell you what it was," he said, ticking off some
quantitative and some qualitative benefits for the museum, from
record attendance and new corporate partnerships to an improved image
of downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The study was paid for by MOCA, the Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau
and Museums Magazine USA and conducted by Lauren Schlau Consulting,
an independent marketing and demographics research firm in Los
Angeles. CIC Research Inc., an economic research company in San
Diego, generated the economic impact estimates. The analysis was
based on interviews with 600 people who attended the exhibition, half
of whom reside in L.A. County. Although the museum reported a total
attendance of 195,000, including school groups and private events,
all those interviewed for the study were among the 180,000
ticket-holders who went to the show during regular hours.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance at the exhibition represents an increase of 275% over
the 65,700 people who visited the museum during the same period in
2001, the study says. For more than half of them, it was their first
trip to MOCA. About 66% of attendees reside in Los Angeles County;
the remainder live in 29 states outside California, the United
Kingdom, Europe, Asia, Australia, Canada and Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   In questions that attempted to determine the effectiveness of
advertising, the study found that 72% of Californians outside L.A.
County decided to see the exhibition before traveling to Los Angeles.
The majority of attendees from elsewhere, 52%, heard about the show
after arriving in Los Angeles. Only 25% of visitors from other
countries were aware of the show before they left home.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 30% of visitors outside the county said the Warhol show was
their primary reason for coming to Los Angeles. That group infused an
estimated $18.7 million into the economy, including 8,300 nights
spent in hotels. Overall, more visitors stayed with friends or family
than in hotels, but those who saw the exhibition spent 28,200 nights
in hotels and spent $3.2 million on lodging. The average length of
stay for out-of-town Warhol attendees was 4.9 nights, significantly
higher than the 3.7-night average for domestic overnight visitors.</TE>
<TE>   The study also covers visitors' perceptions of downtown Los
Angeles. Sixty-five percent of attendees said their experience
exceeded their expectations, primarily because the city is cleaner
than they thought and they found more interesting attractions than
anticipated. Thirty-one percent said they found what they expected.
The remaining 4% cited traffic congestion, parking problems and
inadequate signage as reasons that their expectations were not met.</TE>
<TE>   As for the museum, the $2.7-million show brought in $5.4 million
in income from contributions, ticket sales and 6,600 new memberships,
yielding $2.7 million in profits. In addition, the museum's shop sold
$1.65 million worth of Warhol items.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Strick, MOCA director, called it "a tremendous success."</TE>
<TE>   The challenge now, he said, is to "keep that kind of positive
visitor experience going" and to build on the success of joining
forces with the city, corporate sponsors and the Convention &amp;
Visitors Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   "My hope is that the proof that this show had tangible economic
benefits as well as artistic benefits will help MOCA and other
institutions produce important projects of equivalent cost and
ambition in the future," he said.</TE>

<HD>Anguish Speaks a Universal Tongue</HD>
<DH>Movies* A project unites 11 global filmmakers' responses to
the attacks on the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA NESSELSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Whoever said "there's no such thing as bad publicity" couldn't have
foreseen some of the early reactions to "11'09"01," in which 11
high-profile international filmmakers were given carte blanche to
respond to the events of Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The title, which stems from the date of the attacks as it is
written in much of the world--with the day before the month--also
describes the project's lone constraint.</LD>
<LD>   Each of the individual films had to clock in at precisely 11
minutes 9 seconds and one frame, a challenge 22-year-old Samira
Makhmalbaf of Iran, whose segment kicks off the collection, likens to
that of "a mother trying to dictate the exact weight and height of
her newborn before it exits the womb."</LD>
<TE>   The French-financed omnibus production will premiere at the Venice
Film Festival on Sept. 6 (the festival itself begins Thursday) and
will be shown at the Toronto Film Festival on Sept. 11, the same day
the film opens in theaters throughout France. Negotiations for
American distribution of the film are underway.</TE>
<TE>   Participants, none of whom had any idea of what the others were up
to, range from veteran actor Ernest Borgnine under the direction of
Sean Penn to two-time Palme d'Or winner Shohei Imamura of Japan to
nonprofessional young actors in the poorer enclaves of Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso and Tehran. There also are films by Israeli, Egyptian
and Bosnian filmmakers among many others. Although the attack on the
Pentagon is referenced in two of the segments, events in New York are
the primary focus.</TE>
<TE>   Early news reports last week described some of the segments of the
film as "anti-American" in tone. Interviewed recently in Paris, five
of the film's directors denied the bias, noting instead that they
hoped to put the terrorist attacks in a more global context and bring
attention to injustice beyond U.S. borders.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the 11th day of September has held wrenching power
for Chile and neighboring countries since 1973. The film segment by
England's Ken Loach reminds viewers that Henry Kissinger, then head
of the National Security Council, and then-President Richard Nixon
endorsed Gen. Augusto Pinochet's lethal coup d'etat against Chile's
President Salvador Allende staged on, of all dates, Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Expressing boundless sympathy for the people of New York, Loach's
narrator, a Chilean in exile in London, recounts that 30,000 of his
countrymen perished, victims of torture and murder.</TE>
<TE>   Some may think this sort of history lesson is uncalled for given
the topic at hand, and others may believe that pointed reflection on
political meddling is precisely what's needed in light of current
events.</TE>
<TE>   The project's most contested segment comes from Egypt's Youssef
Chahine, who includes a conversation with the ghost of an American
Marine killed in Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   Some will doubtless argue that Chahine has chosen the wrong forum
in which to suggest--without actually condoning their murderous
logic--that Palestinian suicide bombers believe their actions to be
justified.</TE>
<TE>   Chahine, born in Alexandria in 1926, studied in the late 1940s at
the Pasadena Playhouse. His wide-ranging, politically muddled segment
reflects a man whose early, still-abiding love for America has been
sorely tested by American foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   India's Mira Nair ("Monsoon Wedding") tells a true story of
horribly misguided racism. Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu ("Amores
Perros") uses deft sound design and a handful of images to conjure a
guided meditation through the arc of emotions that burst forth on
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In Penn's segment, Borgnine stars, solo, as a cheerful man who
putters around his Manhattan apartment in a state of denial until a
strange spell is broken on the morning of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Imamura provides the only period piece in the collection. A
demobilized Japanese soldier at the end of WWII believes himself to
be a snake; having seen the horrors of "Holy War" he can't abide the
company of men.</TE>
<TE>   One hopeful undercurrent emerges most consistently in the films'
diverse segments: That Americans and their elected officials realize
that the sheer horror of what befell the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001, is
felt the world over because people and nations across the globe have
themselves been the victims of violence as unfair as it is
devastating.</TE>
<TE>   Danis Tanovic, a 33-year-old Bosnian, won the screenplay award at
Cannes last year and the foreign-language Oscar for "No Man's Land."
His segment centers on a young Bosnian widow in exile for whom the
number 11 is an ever-present wound that refuses to heal.</TE>
<TE>   On the 11th day of every month, the women whose men were
slaughtered in Srebrenica on July 11, 1995, hold commemorative vigils
in their town squares.</TE>
<TE>   "The outside world doesn't particularly care that some 10,000
people were killed there that one day," Tanovic says, adding, "People
who survive tragedies stay frozen in time. So it is not something
that happened only to Bosnians--it happened to everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Tanovic's point is that people in Srebrenica were supposed to be
safe, just as people going to work in the World Trade Center believed
themselves to be safe.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing the dilemma of Bosnian women who not only lost their
loved ones but also cannot return to the homes Serbs appropriated,
Tanovic reluctantly spells out in conversation a tangent his film
subtly implies: "Imagine that the New York women whose husbands were
killed in the twin towers couldn't return to their homes because
members of Al Qaeda were living there."</TE>
<TE>   Israel's Amos Gitai ("Kippur"), a filmmaker who was shaped by his
military experiences, says of his segment: "I made an uninterrupted
11-minute continuous take with very complicated choreography because
on the evening news, everything's chopped up like hamburger into
little individual shots."</TE>
<TE>   On a Tel Aviv street, a car bomb explodes. People appear to be
dead and injured. Ambulances and medics arrive, as well as an Israeli
TV crew whose determined reporter struggles to get the facts, only to
be told by her editor that a bombing in Israel doesn't merit air time
because "something more important, a much bigger story" is unfolding
in New York.</TE>
<TE>   With two well-received features under her belt ("The Apple,"
"Blackboards"), Makhmalbaf shot in an Afghan refugee community near
Tehran.</TE>
<TE>   "I chose children because I wanted to show their innocent point of
view," she says. A teacher instructs her class to observe a minute of
silence for the dead in New York, but her adorable charges are too
young to understand what that means. Until, that is, she has them
gaze at the imposing chimney of the local brick kiln and imagine what
it would be like to have it crumble on their heads.</TE>
<TE>   Her father, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, has been making movies for 20
years, including "Kandahar," which was shown in competition at Cannes
in May 2001 but aroused scant interest among North American
distributors until its eponymous city became news.</TE>
<TE>   "George W. Bush saw it twice!" Samira Makhmalbaf exclaims, calling
the abrupt interest in "Kandahar" after Sept. 11 "a sad thing. While
the president was watching the film, we were biting our nails
wondering if the outcome would be good or bad for Afghanistan," she
says of the country that shares a border and--with a few minor
differences--a language, with Iran.</TE>
<TE>   "Until last September, nobody wanted to know where Afghanistan is
or who are the people who live there. It's too convenient to call
them all terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Although Samira Makhmalbaf's 11 minutes are marbled with
bittersweet humor--two children conclude that Allah couldn't have had
a part in the attacks because "God doesn't own airplanes"--Africa's
Idrissa Ouedraogo is the only writer-director to have found the
near-miraculous comedy in a Sept. 11-related situation.</TE>
<TE>   Five poor schoolboys in Burkina Faso's capital city of Ouagadougou
learn there's a $25-million reward for Osama bin Laden. Certain
they've spotted him in their hometown, the industrious lads are
continually thwarted in their efforts to capture the world's most
wanted man.</TE>
<TE>   Ouedraogo, who was born in Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) in 1954,
says Africa has changed by leaps and bounds in just the past 10 to 15
years. "Satellite television, CNN, etc. have brought us so much of
the outside world. Africa doesn't have enough images of itself, so
images from elsewhere are infiltrating."</TE>
<TE>   Ouedraogo notes, "The thing about the attacks on the World Trade
Center is that no matter how inexperienced the cameraman holding the
video camera, the images have enormous power. Images unleash
emotions, but that's not enough. You have to think about them and
explore the cultural implications."</TE>
<TE>   French director Claude Lelouch was in his editing room on Sept 11.
"My son called at 3 p.m. and told me to turn on the TV," Lelouch said
in an earlier interview about his film segment. "It was the deepest
shock I've experienced in my 64 years on Earth, and I had the Gestapo
after me during WWII."</TE>
<TE>   Lelouch, who won the Palme d'Or and two Oscars for 1966's "A Man
and a Woman" and whose 37th feature "And Now ... Ladies and
Gentlemen," starring Jeremy Irons, will soon be released in the U.S.,
built a Manhattan loft on a Paris soundstage to tell the story of a
Franco-American couple who communicate via sign language. Where
Makhmalbaf's teacher tries to achieve one minute of silence in honor
of the victims, Lelouch provides 11.</TE>
<TE>   Be they set in New York or elsewhere, "11'09"01's" segments
demonstrate that few people anywhere recover quickly from major
trauma. In the hands of talented directors, that is meant to be food
for thought rather than food for controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Note: Profits from "11'09"01" will be donated to the charity
Handicap International, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997.</TE>

<DH>Erykah Badu and Wyclef Jean seek engaging ways to promote
empowerment at Bowl concert.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hip-hop soul queen Erykah Badu and rap jack-of-all-trades Wyclef Jean
both emphasize personal and cultural empowerment in their work. But
on Sunday at the Hollywood Bowl, these acclaimed artists took very
different approaches to getting their messages across.</LD>
<LD>   Headliner Badu took the stage wearing a huge straw hat,
floor-length grass vest, long emerald dress, thigh-length tiny braids
and tall platform boots. Making her Bowl debut in an installment of
its world-music series that also featured global soulsters Zap Mama,
she must have realized the audience wasn't strictly her crowd. After
all, when she broke out the concert favorite "Tyrone," in which she
gives a good-for-nothing boyfriend the boot, almost everyone missed
their cue to join in.</LD>
<LD>   Badu didn't get angry or defensive, but good-naturedly stopped her
nine-piece band, teased the crowd, and explained the drill. Her
patience was rewarded when she sang "So I think you better ... " and
thousands of people yelled, "Call up Tyrone!"</LD>
<TE>   Wyclef Jean's 45-minute set underscored the charismatic former
Fugee's strengths and weaknesses as an artist. He freestyled funny
lines about his airport travails, played guitar passably (but with
teeth-picking, behind-his-back-riffing flash) and mingled jovially
with the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   But his activist stance and most of his social conscience were
obscured by a persona so crowd-pleasing he literally did back flips
at one point.</TE>
<TE>   Still, his band shifted fluidly among the reggae, R&amp;B, hip-hop,
funk, soul and rock blended into such selections as the current hit
"Two Wrongs." But he pinged so relentlessly from song snippet to song
snippet that the performance never really found its groove.</TE>
<TE>   Badu and her group were similarly adept with the mix of Billie
Holiday-esque jazz, propulsive funk and soulful hip-hop in her
75-minute set.</TE>
<TE>   She used her high, agile voice as a lilting, scatting instrument,
as well as a sharp arrow to make points ranging from the
self-acceptance of "Cleva" to the touch-me-like-I-like heat of "Kiss
Me on My Neck" to the sorrow and confusion of a broken commitment (in
an encore tune with guest rapper Common).</TE>
<TE>   By show's end, even those who didn't know her work intimately
understood that she'd revealed more than just the slinky black dress
under her outfit. And they begged for more right up until curfew.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Recording industry veteran Charles Fisher remembers what it was like
being a teenager without direction in his life.</LD>
<LD>   It landed him in trouble with the law.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly three decades later, the former manager to rap
star-turned-actor LL Cool J, who also discovered multi-platinum R&amp;B
singer R. Kelly, says his brushes with the law changed his life.</LD>
<TE>   Fisher aims to use that experience and his influence in the
hip-hop music industry to create opportunities for youths to keep
them from a similar fate.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher, 47, who has worked more than 20 years in the music
business as a producer, manager and talent scout, recently founded
the nonprofit Hip-Hop Summit Youth Council to champion youth causes
and help eliminate negative images in rap.</TE>
<TE>   "Our mission is to better prepare students and young adults for
the obstacles they encounter daily," said Fisher. "It is important
that we call on the hip-hop industry to step up to the plate and
provide the resources needed to improve the social, political and
economic conditions in their school, home and community."</TE>
<TE>   When the first National Hip-Hop Youth Summit convenes on Friday at
York College here, Fisher, the lead organizer, will be joined by
hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons, local elected officials and other
people in the rap industry to discuss ways adults and youths can work
together to improve the image and culture of hip-hop.</TE>
<TE>   The theme of the two-day summit, "Using the Influence of Hip-Hop
to Empower Our Youth," will be used to stress education and
self-pride, Fisher says. "As adults and role models, it is our
obligation to make them aware that without a quality education,
proper training or marketable skills, they are assured low wages,
public assistance or a life of crime."</TE>
<TE>   A series of workshops and seminars will allow youths to meet and
learn from celebrities, athletes and entertainment personalities.
About 800 people are expected to participate. Admission is by
invitation only.</TE>

<LD>The high school years are rarely easy, but imagine if they were
interrupted by a move to another campus, about 1,000 miles away,
often more than once per school year. Different friends, different
teachers, sometimes entirely different courses of instruction.</LD>
<LD>   For thousands of students in the U.S., such upheaval is a reality,
for they are the sons and daughters of field workers compelled by
lack of education and other marketable skills to travel to where
various harvests occur. Contrary to what you might think, many of
these families are longtime U.S. citizens, not recent immigrants.</LD>
<LD>   Director Hannah Weyer's haunting "Escuela," airing at 10 tonight
on KCET as part of PBS' "P.O.V." series, lays out the problems of
such a peripatetic life through the eyes of Liliana Luis. Rather than
make sweeping statements, the hourlong film simply and effectively
presents Luis' experience, as her Mexican American family bounces
between Texas and California.</LD>
<TE>   Whether it's dealing with the bureaucracy built to accommodate the
migration of schoolchildren throughout the Western U.S. or coping
with her growing interest in boys, Luis unself-consciously takes
viewers through the ups and downs.</TE>
<TE>   Luis occasionally addresses questions posed by Weyer, who shot the
film with a small Hi-8 video camera; but mostly Luis simply goes
through daily life, with Weyer acting as a fly on the wall. (Despite
being fairly taut, the film does go off on one tangent, following a
pair of officials searching for two girls who haven't been attending
school.)</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, the film is a sequel to Weyer's 2000 "La Boda"
("wedding" in Spanish), which examined migrant life through a Luis
family wedding celebration. But "Escuela" ("school") stands on its
own as one student's testament to the trials of adolescence
complicated by forces beyond her control.</TE>

<LD>Publicist Elizabeth Hinckley doesn't mince words as she prepares the
weekly group of VIPs for a tour of the Walt Disney Concert Hall, the
$274-million stainless steel-plated structure rising like a
futuristic sailing vessel over Grand Avenue in downtown L.A.</LD>
<LD>   "It's an active site," she tells a small group of reporters and
two folks from the United Talent Agency. "No wandering off ... and
try not to talk." Glances are exchanged as the group dons hard hats,
safety glasses and bright orange vests.</LD>
<LD>   "I haven't been down here since Ricky Martin," a UTA agent notes
as she pulls on a pair of work boots. "About a year ago, we had him
do the whole opera thing."</LD>
<TE>   The concert hall won't open for another year, but Hinckley, the
director of public relations for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, has
been giving tours of the place since last summer. It helps raise
money, she said. One patron donated more than $1 million after she
visited.</TE>
<TE>   Hinckley explains "the thought process of the building." In 1987,
Lillian Disney donated $50 million in seed money, and planners spent
the next decade or so designing it. Behind the tour group, 500
workers diligently hammer away at the 293,000-square-foot structure
that Hinckley says has no right angles. The computer-generated plan
is so complex that builders have used a modified global-positioning
system to place stainless-steel plates on the building's exterior.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the tour moves up four flights of handrail-free stairs to
overlook what will be a grand staircase at the building's entrance.
"No Stairmaster for me tonight," the agent grumbles. Hinckley is
hardly winded. "This will be a lot of air and space," she says,
motioning toward a large window overlooking Grand Avenue. For now,
the air is thick with construction dust, the floors are crowded with
boards, steel girders and generators and the view is obscured by
scaffolding. A fellow from the Sunday Times of London asks: "What's
the color scheme going to be?" The answer: That is to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   Then the group heads into the gem of the tour--the main auditorium
designed by architect Frank Gehry in collaboration with acousticians
Yasuhisa Toyota and Minoru Nagata. A crane sits in the middle of what
will be a theater-in-the-round. "Here you are part of what's
happening," she says of the auditorium. "You're part of the
experience." Echoes of machinery fill the 2,263-seat hall. Overhead
is a curved ceiling made from Douglas fir. Many people, says
Hinckley, say it looks like the inside of a ship's hull. This portion
of the building should be completed by May, then crews will spend all
summer tuning it. "We'll hire professional listeners," she says.</TE>
<TE>   From there, it's on to the rooftop gardens. Next year, visitors
will be able to sit amid dense trees and enjoy city vistas. Now, the
place looks like a community of empty swimming pools. A few empty
lawn chairs sit in one corner. Everyone is impressed by visions of a
lush garden escape in the middle of the city. "This building is much
more than a concert hall," Hinckley says.</TE>
<TE>   The 90-minute tour ends in the dressing room of the L.A.
Philharmonic's conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen. It's a modest-sized space
with a slanted wall of windows that looks out onto a pile of dirt, an
area that will soon be a private garden. "For many of you, this is
probably the only chance you'll get to be in [the conductor's]
dressing room," Hinckley says. The group seems unmoved.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, people start walking out. But Hinckley squeezes in one more
important detail: The project, she says, is "on budget and on time."</TE>
<TE>   Target: British Men</TE>
<TE>   Gwyneth Paltrow caught the ire of the British press recently after
complaining to a magazine that she only had two dates during a stay
in London this spring. "British people don't seem to ask each other
out on dates," she told the magazine Now. "If someone asks you out,
they're really going out on a limb, whereas in America, it happens
all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Paltrow's sentiments echoed those of Canadian writer Leah McLaren,
who lamented that when it comes to dating, British men are "the worst
on the planet."</TE>
<TE>   "They were as charming as [Oasis singer] Liam Gallagher after 12
pints," McLaren wrote in the magazine Spectator.</TE>
<TE>   The observations of Paltrow and McLaren provoked a flurry of
headlines and columns. It didn't help that Heather Graham told
journalists at the premiere of "The Guru" in London that British men
are "cold" and "emotionally illiterate."</TE>
<TE>   One newspaper, the Daily Telegraph, responded with a "Miss
Moneypenny" defense.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with Samantha Bond, who has portrayed 007's
secretary in James Bond films, the actress defended British men,
saying they were as skilled in dating as their American counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the English man has great charm; he is highly intelligent
and surely his reluctance to pounce on a first date can only be a
mark in his favor," Bond said, according to the Daily Telegraph.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows a degree of integrity and maturity, and one wonders what
American women are looking for if being seduced is the guideline of a
good date or not."</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with me, I've decided, is that I have no charisma,
[but] I don't like charismatic people. Only healthy people are
charismatic. I like [messed up] people who can't even carry a
conversation. Let me introduce my band ...."</TE>

<LD>WATER WARS</LD>
<LD>   Drought, Flood, Folly, and the Politics of Thirst</LD>
<LD>   By Diane Raines Ward</LD>
<TE>   Riverhead Books</TE>
<TE>   280 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Water--the life-giving substance, available abundantly and
inexpensively at the turn of a tap, at least in the urban U.S.--is
becoming ever more precious. Drought makes scant and disease fouls
drinking water in many parts of the world. An overload of water
threatens the city of Venice, and is held at bay by massive
engineering feats in the Netherlands. Water runs wild in the form of
floods, destroying vast populated and agricultural areas, most
recently in Germany, and over-irrigation has led to the creation of
salted, virtually sterile land. (As water from irrigation evaporates
on the land, an accumulation of salt is left behind, eventually
disabling the land's ability to produce crops.) In Bangkok, Jakarta,
Manila and Mexico City, ground water has been so depleted that the
land supporting those cities is collapsing.</TE>
<TE>   When water is scarce, economic hardship, and sometimes violence,
results. "As the supply of water fails, costs rise," writes Diane
Raines Ward in "Water Wars," a solidly researched, eminently
accessible book on the world's water situation. In Nigeria, the poor
spend almost 20% of their income on water, she points out, and water
use was a key cause of the Middle East's Six-Day War. Water remains a
sticking point amid Middle East tensions and has been a crucial
element in relations between India and Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Wars have been fought over oil, a commodity without which motors
will stop. "But if you stop the water supply," says a Turkish
minister whom she interviews, "life stops." Ward travels to the hot
spots of water concern: India, Pakistan, the Middle East, China, and
many parts of the U.S., including California's Imperial Valley and
Las Vegas, to interview engineers, farmers, water experts,
politicians and those who are just passionate about water.</TE>
<TE>   She considers the details of massive engineering achievements
(dams, canals, hydroelectric plants, etc.) that have improved water
access and usage in some places and that have caused more harm than
good in others. Meanwhile, she traces changes in the global climate
and how they are speeding up what Ward terms "the water crisis."
Ultimately, Ward explores new methods--especially small, local
ones--that allow for improved use and husbanding of water.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, the human response to water (its lack and
overabundance) has been in large-scale engineering. Dam the water,
build canals, move the river, alter the natural resources to suit our
needs. This blind faith in human maneuvers has not always proven
beneficial. Especially in developing countries, where the water issue
is so acute, reliance on engineering solutions alone has often been
problematic. "It is comparatively easy to put up concrete buttresses
and viaducts," Ward writes. "But those cement structures disrupt
natural systems with artificial conduits that need an amount of care,
money, and good governmental management not usually figured into
project plans." At the heart of the issue, Ward suggests, is that
those governments that build large irrigation systems "have generally
failed to see irrigation for what it really is--a social contract."</TE>
<TE>   To whom does water belong? What are our responsibilities for
shepherding this resource? These questions form the core of Ward's
book, in which she urges us to move beyond one-dimensional
engineering strategies and view water not as a political issue, but
as a vital social contract among everyone on the planet. Engineering
may be part of the solution, but only a part. "Giant canals and dams
are often built for reasons that a small investment in human trust
and human community would have made unnecessary," says an expert on
the Pakistani water situation.</TE>
<TE>   "Forty percent of the world's population carry their water from
wells, rivers, ponds or puddles outside of their homes," Ward reminds
us. "More significantly, many do not have enough--1.4 billion, [more
than] twenty percent of those living on the planet, don't have access
to an adequate supply of clean water." It's easy to forget, here in
California, where all the clean water we'd like is readily available,
where your water comes from and all the convolutions that have taken
place to bring you that magical tap of nonstop H2O. It's easy to
forget that things are radically different in much of the world and
may become different here, as well.</TE>
<TE>   If we work within and not against the balanced state of nature,
Ward suggests, and cooperate with each other regardless of national
borders, we may effect change.</TE>
<TE>   We will be able to manage this vital dwindling resource--though
ocean levels are rising because of global warming, supplies of fresh
water are declining--if we pay attention. "It's very difficult to get
people interested in water as a global or even regional issue," one
expert tells her, "but if you bring it down to the kitchen sink, we
all do get the general picture." This book, which should be required
reading for all of us living with lawns, sprinklers and pools in an
arid climate, packs an important kitchen-sink punch.</TE>

<LD>Jim Morrison sang about building a woman 10 feet tall.</LD>
<LD>   Frankenstein got his bride with a beehive in overdrive.</LD>
<LD>   The Stepford Wives came off the line as sexy, submissive
homemakers.</LD>
<TE>   But usually when the entertainment and advertising industries
construct their women from scratch, the results are pretty
predictable. Just look at the latest model in theaters. "Simone" is a
honey-blond, blue-eyed, smooth-skinned goddess in the flesh.</TE>
<TE>   The movie's twist is that Simone is a fake, a digital rendering of
a beautiful actress who becomes wildly popular with the gullible
masses and press.</TE>
<TE>   Though it's meant to satirize our slathering appetite for
celebrity in any form, "Simone" is itself another glossy page in the
mass media catalog of stereotypical feminine beauty.</TE>
<TE>   "If I've only one life, let me live it as a blonde!" So read the
caption in a magazine ad for Ultra Blue Lady Clairol. That was in
1958. The clay was still wet on our model of the perfect American
woman. She'd been taking shape for years.</TE>
<TE>   Grable's legs. Hayworth's curves. Monroe's platinum tresses (not
to mention her aura of vapid fun). Soon to come was the sun-kissed
skin and carefree spirit of the Beach Boys' California Girls. Take
off some pounds with Twiggy, and we're getting close to the look of
today.</TE>
<TE>   Every year, more than $1 billion is spent on hair-color products.
Though only 19% of American women were born blond, shades of blond
make up 39% of hair color sales, compared with 37% for brown and 18%
for red, according to Clairol. But one study showed that although 84%
of women think that most men prefer blonds, in reality, only 35% of
the men interviewed said that was true.</TE>
<TE>   What about the body? Only 3% to 5% of American women between 20
and 29 have the type of body idealized by models and the more
sculpted celebrities, says Lisa Berzins, a West Hartford psychologist
who specializes in eating disorders. Research has shown that men are
attracted to women more curvaceous than the waifs they're presented
with, says Stacey Tantleff-Dunn, a psychologist at the University of
Central Florida.</TE>
<TE>   So do we really want to be with WASPy Gwyneth Paltrow, or is her
image in the movies and elsewhere just telling us so?</TE>
<TE>   The answer--for both sexes--has been lost somewhere between the
buff and buxom "Baywatch" patrol and our primitive attraction to
signs of fertility. Along the way, these unattainable images of
beauty do their damage.</TE>
<TE>   Research has shown how television and movies can particularly
undermine the self-esteem of young women.</TE>
<TE>   The digital star of "Simone" is Rachel Roberts, a Canadian model
whose contract included a gag order. To market the movie, its
producers downplayed her flesh-and-blood status. The end credits list
only "Simone as Herself." To play the part, Roberts was pixilated
liberally, of course, her parts enhanced or smoothed wherever
necessary.</TE>

<HD>Trail of Broken Hearts and Recipes</HD>

<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why would anyone put together a collection of recipes left behind by
castoff lovers? It's the rare boyfriend, after all, who has the skill
to whip up a romantic repast. Unless he's dating Erin Ergenbright or
Thisbe Nissen.</LD>
<LD>   The two friends recently wrote "The Ex-Boyfriend Cookbook: They
Came, They Cooked, They Left ... (But We Ended Up With Some Great
Recipes)." A great concept, and it's amazing that two 30-year-old
women have amassed enough exes and their recipes to fill a 175-page
cookbook.</LD>
<LD>   "I tend to think that it might have something to do with the fact
that we've both lived in weird bohemian communities," Nissen says.
"I've spent a lot of time living in co-ops and working on organic
farms. I think you tend to find more men in that environment who cook
than in investment banking."</LD>
<TE>   Plus, they lived in Iowa City, Iowa, and "a culinary mecca it's
not." The "strange, artsy, hippie boys" Nissen and Ergenbright dated
shared recipes like "Quesadilla Things" and "Popcorn Cake."</TE>
<TE>   The authors met at the University of Iowa's Writing Workshop. As
graduate fellows, they lived together four years ago, where one day
before a party, Ergenbright said, "I should make Davis Haggerty's
spicy barbecue sauce!" and the book idea was born.</TE>
<TE>   As Nissen says, people who browse a bookstore's cookbook section
"are not looking for 'The Ex-Boyfriend Cookbook,' they're looking for
someone who can teach them how to do something, like Julia Child or
James Beard." Although they say the book, released in June, has been
selling well, the authors would prefer the book to be shelved
somewhere else.</TE>
<TE>   With fiction, perhaps?</TE>
<TE>   A vignette about the boy and the breakup accompanies each recipe.
Many of the stories are fake, though the recipes aren't. The gazpacho
that Lucas Amarati made on the organic vegetable farm? "It's actually
my mother's gazpacho recipe," Nissen admits. "And it's really good."</TE>
<TE>   Ergenbright says she isn't much of a cook, but "I can make
everything that goes into this book. I use this book, it has every
recipe I love."</TE>
<TE>   . The authors arranged the layout of the cookbook "artistically,"
based on color schemes in the elaborate collages that decorate each
page. "It's hard to find things sometimes," Ergenbright admits,
"because it might be spicy and slippery."</TE>
<TE>   That's right, the six chapters are "Sweet," "Sort of Fluffy,"
"Savory," "Spicy," "Slippery" and "Substantial."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lighthearted book; it's not vindictive," Nissen says. "In
a lot of ways, working on the stories for this was the antidote to
writing serious literary fiction. We got to save our angst and fear
of everything that one can be fearful of when writing. That gets
relegated to our serious projects."</TE>
<TE>   It's chick-lit, but the anti-"Nanny Diaries"--not biting or
vengeful. "We just have to get our book on "Sex and the City' and
we'd be set," Ergenbright says.</TE>
<TE>   Urban Outfitters, that hip repository of inflatable chairs and
tiki shot glasses, will stock the book. Ergenbright and Nissen speak
fondly of their many "exes." They changed all real names except for
Vito's--the chef was dating Ergenbright when they sold the book, and
insisted on having a recipe included.</TE>
<TE>   "My task was to write our [fictional] demise," she writes,
"without mentioning that it was rather ridiculous that we were even
together at all. I don't think we even made it one more week, but
Vito got what he wanted." For the record, Ergenbright is now single
and hopeful, while Nissen has a boyfriend (who cooks, but not for
her).</TE>
<TE>   The full-color glossy pages display mementos of the two women's
lives and loves (if there's a photo of someone whose eyes aren't
blacked out, it's one of the authors). As a matter of fact, Nissen
says publishers weren't actually interested in the book until they
had seen the collages. "They all said, 'We don't publish cookbooks by
unheard-of cookbook authors. Thanks anyway.' ... I think people just
respond to the collages. That was the part that took the most time
and that we enjoyed the most." They even sought out recipes and tall
tales to suit their favorite visuals.</TE>
<TE>   The process of making collages meshed with the process of
storytelling. "I would fly out to Portland [Ore.]"--after Ergenbright
moved there--"and we would collage madly and drink wine for a week,"
says Nissen, who still lives in Iowa City. "We'd call up friends and
say, 'Tell us the craziest date you've ever been on.' "</TE>
<TE>   That's how they got the story of Gary the cocaine addict, who sent
one of the authors his mother's recipes from jail. "I think it's much
more fun that there are lots of actual people who are collaged into
it," Ergenbright says.</TE>
<TE>   And it saves the rest of womanhood from thinking they're missing
all the great chefs.</TE>

<LD>If ever there was a musical waiting to be written, it's Karyn
Bosnak's tale--the true saga of a bubbly small-town blond who learns
about life and debt when she moves to the big city.</LD>
<LD>   Act 1: Our heroine is a winsome lass from Gurnee, Ill., near where
her sweet, shopaholic mother owns a frozen-custard shop and her
straight-arrow dad (a telephone repairman) never bought anything he
couldn't afford to pay for with cash.</LD>
<LD>   Bosnak's parents divorced when she was small. Her mother remarried
and continued to shop. "My mom thinks shopping solves everything,"
Bosnak said in a telephone interview. "She was like, 'Feeling low?
Let's buy a blouse to cheer you up.' Or 'You got good grades? Let's
shop to celebrate.' We were once on vacation and she actually charged
a Mercedes on a credit card. I just grew up that way."</LD>
<TE>   (K.C. Dieck, Bosnak's mother, confirms that story but says she did
not leave the car on her credit card. "I went home and immediately
refinanced it." Shopping "runs in our family," she said. "My mother
loved it, too.")</TE>
<TE>   Bosnak, who says only that she's in her 20s, graduated from
Chicago's Columbia College in 1996, took some local TV production
jobs and left in 2000 to find her fortune in New York. She was soon
earning $100,000 a year as a cable TV producer, she said. That seemed
a fortune indeed. With that kind of money, she figured, she could
afford just about anything.</TE>
<TE>   The credit card companies agreed. They sent her more plastic cards
than she could comfortably carry in her new Gucci wallet. She used
them all. "The offers came in the mail. I had seven cards at my peak.
I would run them up, get a new card, transfer the balance, and then I
had a zero balance on the first one. It was great."</TE>
<TE>   Bosnak also fell in love. Not with a guy, but with Bergdorf
Goodman, the handsome stone edifice on upper Fifth Avenue, just steps
from the Plaza hotel, across from Trump Towers. It is a wonderland
packed with goodies that only the very rich can afford. Bosnak felt
very rich.</TE>
<TE>   She made frequent pilgrimages from her one-room East 57th street
apartment (at $1,950 per month) to the store's cosmetic counter,
where she regularly loaded up on La Prairie products, paying up to
$150 per jar. Then she'd bop around the shop, swathing her shapely
size 6 figure in Prada, Gucci, BCBG, Theory and Shelli Segal clothes.
She bought $400 shoes, $500 bags, $600 coats--"That's not a bad price
for a warm coat"--and she never paid cash.</TE>
<TE>   Next, she'd hop a cab to Bloomingdale's, "it was open till 9," and
in addition to clothes, she'd charge "all sorts of great stuff for
the house."</TE>
<TE>   Bosnak's constant stream of lattes, manicures, pedicures, bikini
waxes were adding up. Her monthly haircut and blond highlights alone
cost $400, which she said is "standard price for a good cut and color
out here." Her twice-weekly personal trainer cost $800 per month. "It
sounds so over-the-top," she said, "but it's just what things cost in
New York."</TE>
<TE>   Just about the time that Bosnak sat down to add up her credit card
bills, (which tallied about $20,000 after little more than a year),
she lost her job.</TE>
<TE>   Act 1 ends operatically. Our heroine flings herself onto her
goose-down comforter, sobbing uncontrollably in her Fendi robe. She
has nowhere to turn. She is too embarrassed to even tell friends how
much she owes; she cannot tell her family. What's worse, the economy
has tanked and she cannot land even a menial job. Curtain falls.</TE>
<TE>   Act 2: Bosnak's Brilliant Idea. She is alone at her laptop, in her
new, less expensive Brooklyn apartment, which she shares. She cannot
afford to go out. She has bought an Internet domain name and set up a
Web site (www.save karyn.com) and has begun cyber-begging to pay off
her debts.</TE>
<TE>   "Hello! My name is Karyn, I'm really nice and I'm asking for your
help! You see, I have this huge credit card debt and I need your help
to pay it off. So if you have an extra buck or two, please send it my
way!"</TE>
<TE>   After just over a month, a few thousand dollars have trickled in.
She's received 10,000 e-mails on her multi-page site. She adds to it
every day. An introductory letter explains who she is without
revealing her full name and how she got in this mess. A page called
"The Daily Buck" tells the things she's doing to save and earn money.
She's selling her clothes on EBay, cutting her own hair, using Oil of
Olay, shopping at Old Navy, if at all.</TE>
<TE>   An entry from last Wednesday: "Today I broke down and ordered some
much-needed contact lenses." She didn't buy them from her doctor,
where they're $30, she writes on her site, but did extensive pricing
research on the Web. She then tells readers where she found lenses
for $10 less. She is helping others. She is also becoming a Miss
Financial Lonelyhearts of sorts, answering e-mails from around the
world--India, Australia, New Zealand, England--from people in worse
debt than she is who want her advice. She starts to feel wise. In
control. Of use. She still does not go out, even with good friends,
she explained, "because I am still in debt and I am too embarrassed
to talk about it."</TE>
<TE>   She has realized recently that she loves to write. Her Web site is
packed with cheery, practical prose that is neither profound nor
deeply personal--just an ongoing surface explanation of her life and
times.</TE>
<TE>   And she is becoming controversial. Anti-save-Karyn Web sites are
popping up. Chat rooms are full of pro-and anti-Karyn chatter. Is she
a self-centered, spoiled spendthrift or a clever girl who has seen
the error of her ways and is trying to go straight? TV and print
journalists are e-mailing her their phone numbers, asking her to
call. She eventually does.</TE>
<TE>   Brief stories have appeared in papers around the country, but she
remained anonymous. She did not want to divulge her name until her
bills were paid. About two weeks ago, she finally told her mother
about her debt and her Internet begging scheme, and all went well.
When she tried to tell her dad, he kept hollering, "You owe what?!
You owe what?!"</TE>
<TE>   "I can't get to tell him the Internet part because he can't get
over the fact that I ran up such bills. He is in shock."</TE>
<TE>   Curtain falls as Bosnak is trying to futilely explain how it all
happened.</TE>
<TE>   Act 3: A Milwaukee journalist finds Bosnak's 80-year-old
grandfather in Wisconsin, who inadvertently reveals his grandchild's
full identity. She decides to out herself before anyone else
does--even though she still owes $10,000. On Aug. 16 she goes on the
"Today" show, where she is interviewed by Matt Lauer. "He's a real
dreamboat," she later said. Agents watch the show, find her
telegenic, sunny, marketable. They call with proposals for her to do
books and films. "Nothing is finalized yet," she said. "In fact," she
confided, "I'm not sure any of that will work out." But what
definitely will benefit her future, she said, is all she has learned
from this experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I realize I've lived the wrong way. It's not just about shopping
and debt. It's that I always chased the jobs that paid the most
money. I'd leave each job for one that paid better, though I never
was really happy in any of them. I liked the people but not the
career. TV production was what I knew how to do, and I felt stuck
with it."</TE>
<TE>   Since she's been unemployed and poor, she said, she's "just happy
with who I really am. I don't feel the need to shop anymore. Even if
I had money, I'd never do it again." As a result of all this, she's
found things she's really good at, things she likes to do. Like
writing.</TE>
<TE>   "This Web site is very me. I now know I can get my feelings across
when I write. I've had about 500,000 hits in the past two months,"
she said, and she thinks maybe that's because people like what she
writes.</TE>
<TE>   She may have a point. Other cyber-begging sites have been up
longer than hers and have received nowhere near the response. Most
are crass, one-note solicitations from people who seem to believe
they deserve a handout. One man is panhandling for a Hummer, others
just for fun and profit. Bosnak's, on the other hand, comes across as
sincere. She said she's proud she's been totally open and honest
throughout her financial crisis. She did wrong, she admitted it, she
asked for help. She furthermore didn't want anyone to contribute to
her instead of giving to charity. "If they had an extra buck after
everything, I hoped they'd send it to me."</TE>
<TE>   Her future looks brighter now than when she was earning big bucks.
"I've learned I can really communicate this way," she said. Whether
current offers pan out or not, she plans to write a book about her
experience. And she'd like to find work that involves writing,
something in marketing or public relations, perhaps. "It was my major
in college, and maybe I shouldn't have strayed away."</TE>
<TE>   Choral finale: Bosnak is at home with her new retinue of managers,
agents and attorneys, all of whom are belting out advice on her
upcoming book, TV talk show and indie film. Anything's possible, it's
a musical, right?</TE>

<HD>Greetings From L.A.</HD>
<DH>Local poets capture the essence of a city in works to be
printed on free postcards</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most Angelenos are accustomed to the shorthand, wish-you-were-here
postcards that render L.A. in the simplest terms: skyline and beach.</LD>
<LD>   One Angeleno's "perfection," however, is another's "cliche." And
that's the greatest challenge to fixing a sense of Los Angeles on a
glossy 3-by-5 rectangle. True Angelenos know that Los Angeles is
neither easily accessed nor summarized, says poet Terry Wolverton,
who's just completed her most recent attempt to encourage writers to
try.</LD>
<LD>   "There's been a lot of writing about the city, the myth of the
city," says Wolverton, who since arriving in Los Angeles in 1976 has
been crafting her own series of compact portraits and meditations in
poetry and prose. "If you come to L.A. and try to wrap your arms
around the whole thing ... well, you can't."</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps that's because it is so diffuse. L.A. is a feeling. It's a
shade of light, a mix of spice and fruit carried on a hot wind. A
forgotten road. An impossible hill. Above all, the traces it leaves
are deeply personal. And Wolverton sensed that they could best be
captured in a gallery of pictures drawn from memory and the
senses--in words. Thus was born "Sense of Site," a series of eight
small literary works on postcards. Chosen in an open competition,
with winners recently selected, poetic likenesses of L.A. will begin
appearing on thousands of free postcards around the city in November.</TE>
<TE>   Wolverton, who teaches poetry and runs the Silver Lake-based
writers collective Writers at Work, has been pondering ways to make
art in and of L.A. "I'd been looking at a way to break [the arts] out
of this arts ghetto," says Wolverton on a waning late-summer
afternoon as she pauses between projects at her airy Writers at Work
space.</TE>
<TE>   As part of this effort, three years ago Wolverton began curating a
group effort to expose Angelenos to poetry in as many far-flung nooks
and crannies of the Southland as possible.</TE>
<TE>   The first two projects--2000's "Sonnets at Work" and last year's
"Prose Poems," funded in part by the Cultural Affairs
Department--helped to distribute free postcards in cafes,
restaurants, clothing stores and malls across the basin. They also
helped to spark curiosity and conversation. Imagine: Poems dotted
among the sexy vodka ads or snide television promos stuffed in
spinner racks just outside the loo!</TE>
<TE>   But this year during the grant process, Wolverton found herself
wondering: Instead of spreading just any poetry, why not poems about
L.A.?</TE>
<TE>   She put out a call to writers and, grants secured (this time from
Cultural Affairs as well as the private Durfee Foundation), all she
had to do was sit back and wait for the July deadline.</TE>
<TE>   As poems drifted in, L.A. slowly emerged like a print shimmering
up in a darkroom tray.</TE>
<TE>   Page after page, frame after frame, personal panoramas--more than
100 in all--fanned out before her: Fish tacos. Hollywood ghosts.
Stained glass. Dodger blue. Stucco adorning the city's hem like
decorative bric-a-brac. The Los Angeles that sang, prayed, shopped,
hoped, loved and broadcast from those pages felt as wide and
cacophonous as the city.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge wasn't to pick pieces that confirmed old stories or
animated familiar vistas or rituals, but those that evoked the
specific, "a unique vision," in 15 lines of poetry or 143 words of
prose. "Each of the pieces chosen is very particular about the site
itself. Not a generic view," Wolverton says. "There's kind of an
emotional investment in the site, while being very visual, very
well-rendered pieces of writing."</TE>
<TE>   For some, like poet A.K. Toney, L.A. was evoked by ritual and
rhythms of Leimert Park's World Stage Performance Gallery, where
"every witness is ascending more into feeling / the i was born from
voice melodizing praise / to learn expression ancestors created ... "
For Ariel Robello, L.A. is a pause in the Odd Fellows Cemetery, where
"each caw carries the soul of OG Veteranos / lost in battlefields
home and abroad." It is a stroll through a local farmers market. A
humming downtown garment district. It is the 405, the 105, Santa
Monica Boulevard, potholes, bougainvillea. Barnsdall Park palm trees
that, writes Holly Prado, "shift into angels / patterned through a
crowded sky."</TE>
<TE>   Wolverton found herself wavering and reconsidering as she narrowed
down her list. Cost and printing format concerns forced her to
whittle the winners to eight, whose names will be announced in
November. Beyond artistry, she was looking for a range of voices and
locations. "There are really extra-literary conditions. Like, there
were way too many poems about Silver Lake," she says with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   The winners will each receive $250,  and Wolverton is crunching
numbers and looking for other ways to secure some money for the
runners-up as well.</TE>
<TE>   A total of 80,000 cards--10,000 of each winning entry--will be
printed and distributed in 291 M@x Racks throughout the region. Those
are numbers seldom heard in the cottage industry of poetry, Wolverton
says. "A good run of a book of poetry is 1,000; a poetry journal,
1,000. This is significant. In these racks, we'll get to people who
never go looking for poetry. Or those who delight in poetry but won't
go to a reading because it's just not part of their world view or
framework."</TE>
<TE>   Wolverton acknowledges that "there is not eight of anything that
could fairly represent Los Angeles' diversity of experience, of voice
or location. Eight is ludicrous." She is, however, moved by the
minute details--L.A. textures and moods--that writers rendered within
such a small space. The city isn't just alive, but surprising.</TE>
<TE>   Though the incarnation of the Cultural Affairs' Regional Arts
Grant that funded this postcard series will not be offered after this
year, Wolverton isn't worried. "You see wildflowers growing out of
concrete all the time," she says.</TE>
<TE>   She has big hopes for the future and possibilities for this
project. Inspired, she tosses out one idea, then another: "Maybe a
bus tour to all of the spots where the writers could read at the site
that they wrote about. Maybe we create a folio or map with each poem
placed at its site. All this may not happen in this iteration, but
there was such an enthusiastic response that I think that we could
carry this further."</TE>
<TE>   It's a journey without final destination, and Wolverton has big
hopes about what awaits around the next blind corner. "I don't know
if it has been so much about learning about the city. But I think
it's confirmed that we really love our city. Our representation of
city, our representative city. And I don't know if people own up to
that very much."</TE>
<TE>   A reading and free two-hour "Sense of Site" workshop led by
Wolverton will be held Nov. 17 at Skylight Books in Los Feliz. For
more information, call Writers at Work, (323) 661-5954.</TE>

<HD>A Woman of Meditation and a Million Words</HD>
<DH>As a mentor and yogi, Sally Kirkland stretches beyond
acting. It's a life of spirituality and Hollywood sparkle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUISE ROUG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You've heard of Sally Kirkland: actress, acting coach, red-carpet
fixture. Now meet Sally Kirkland in her latest incarnation: yoga
teacher and spiritual mentor.</LD>
<LD>   At 9 on Saturday morning, there she was--on the sand south of the
Santa Monica Pier instructing about a dozen students, mostly aspiring
actors. The beach was just about big enough for Kirkland's expansive
personality.</LD>
<LD>   Kirkland, who wore a colorful shirt, black leggings and just a
touch of pale lipstick, her blond hair piled high, told her students
to lay their towels near the bike path, facing her. "Get high on
life, get high on yoga," she quoted her swami, as joggers, surfers
and couples on in-line skates stopped to stare. Turning to a group of
onlookers, Kirkland was enthusiastic: "Y'all can join in, if you
want."</LD>
<TE>   She teaches a weekly yoga class to a group of mostly young actors
at a local acting school. Sometimes she comes to this beach, other
times she brings her class to Malibu. Over the years, she said, she
has taught Robert De Niro, Elia Kazan, Robert Redford and Bob Dylan.</TE>
<TE>   On this morning, a couple of injuries--a stage fall and a surprise
encounter with a pothole as she walked in West Hollywood--kept her
from performing the exercises. Instead, she was forced to talk her
students through the class. Soon, Kirkland--a woman of a few million
words--got going on one of her many pet subjects: the abysmal state
of yoga in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm horrified," Kirkland told her students. "The power yoga.
Suddenly, yoga is about, 'I can get more into a pretzel than you
can.' " Yoga, she said, is not about gymnastics but about meditation
and contemplation.</TE>
<TE>   "If anyone has a spiritual tone, that's fine," she told the class.
"Breathe in, and exhale that tone." Students chanted in response. In
the background, an ambulance revved up its tone. A woman pushed an
elderly man in a wheelchair to the edge of the sand from which he
observed the class. The class did a shoulder stand. A tourist stepped
up to take a picture of Kirkland.</TE>
<TE>   Her concentration wavered slightly. "We have a monkey mind," she
told the class. "The mind is going all around the place, like a
monkey."</TE>
<TE>   Two women walked by, both on their cell phones. A public work crew
nearby shouted jokes to one another as they swept sand from the
boardwalk. A transient passed, his boombox blasting Tom Petty.</TE>
<TE>   "Every moment of one's life can be a meditation," Kirkland
suggested over the noise.</TE>
<TE>   As the class drew to a close, a man lingered on the edge. Kirkland
gave a little shriek, ran toward him and threw herself in his arms.</TE>
<TE>   "This is Dan Cohn. He just had a series green-lighted with Penny
Marshall. He was the power behind Sally for four or five years."
(Kirkland has the Bob Dole-ish tendency to talk about herself in the
third person.)</TE>
<TE>   Cohn, who was once Kirkland's personal assistant, gave a shy,
dismissive wave of the hand and Kirkland began introducing the
students. Mostly, they were introduced in the same breath as their
acting credits.</TE>
<TE>   A few of her own were displayed later, as she gave a tour of her
modest West Hollywood apartment, crammed with memorabilia and
paintings she has made.</TE>
<TE>   Movie posters and photographs became short cuts to stories about
the important people in her life: Jesus, Gandhi, Shirley MacLaine,
and her guru, Swami Satchidananda, who died last week.</TE>
<TE>   "There's Bob Dylan, I dated him, and all that stuff," she said,
pointing to a photo, one of the hundreds of images competing for
space in her apartment.</TE>
<TE>   She pointed to one of her own paintings. "This is a little
Matisse-y. It's Sally running after the Lord."</TE>
<TE>   She pointed to another one of her creations: an oil landscape,
with bits of crocheted yarn glued on, hanging above her bed. "Shirley
MacLaine loved that. I meant to give it to her, but I haven't gotten
around to it yet."</TE>
<TE>   More stories, more celebs: Madonna, Modigliani, Joan of Arc and
Robert De Niro. And, especially, Sally.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the night I introduced Bob Dylan to Bob De Niro.... This
is when I was campaigning with Gray Davis.... My mother and Grace
Kelly, with either Mr. Neiman or Mr. Marcus.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's when I taught Oprah yoga on her show.... This is when we
all went to Israel and Egypt during the Gulf War, working for peace.
I ended up meeting Kadafi.... This is when I was helping out Sharon
Stone with a charity. Here's an old boyfriend, Kris Kristofferson."</TE>
<TE>   Another collage, this one with a photograph of Kirkland in a gold
lame dress, the hem of which was hiked in the front like a swagged
curtain. "They made fun of me at the Oscars," she said. "It made copy
all the way to Nigeria." She didn't mind too much, though.</TE>
<TE>   "I think of myself as a clown," she said, before drawing a rare
breath.</TE>
<TE>   A momentary pause in the stream of consciousness, and a segue into
other worlds: her ministry with the Movement of Spiritual Inner
Awareness, her work counseling women who say they have been
physically impaired by their silicone breast implants.</TE>
<TE>   She believes she has "silicone on my brain" as a result of her
implants, which she eventually had removed.</TE>
<TE>   Pointing to a collage of spirits, models and angels, Kirkland
paused and reflected on the twin themes of her life. "The dichotomy
of spirituality and glamour, you know."</TE>

<LD>Months before her South Korean grandfather came to live with them,
Nellie's mother instructed her on how to behave and what to expect.</LD>
<LD>   "In Korea," her mother said. "Old people are given the highest
respect, especially grandparents. Your grandfather--oe haraboji (weh
hah-rah-budgee)--will expect this from us."</LD>
<LD>   "What exactly do you mean?" Nellie asked. "What am I supposed to
do?"</LD>
<TE>   "Well," her mother answered. "One example is that my father will
always be served first at meals."</TE>
<TE>   "What if I forget?" Nellie said.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't worry, Nellie," Mrs. Connors assured her. "I won't let you
forget. I will say things like 'Nellie, please pass the taktchum
(took-jeem), the chicken stew, to your oe haraboji.' "</TE>
<TE>   The mother smiled at her young daughter and told her there was
plenty of time for her to learn the most important Korean customs and
words before her grandfather arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Nellie's mother and father had met in Korea 10 years ago when
Charles Connors was stationed there with the peacekeeping forces.
They fell in love and were married in a Korean ceremony shortly
before his tour of duty was over.</TE>
<TE>   Nellie's mother, Ok Cha (Jade Child) Kim, wore a hanbok
(hahn-boak) for the traditional wedding ceremony. This was a
multicolored gown, embroidered with gold thread.</TE>
<TE>   Nellie's father, Charles, and her mother made deep bows of respect
to the elders in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day the bride followed the custom of holding her
floor-length skirt out so guests and family could throw dates into
it.</TE>
<TE>   The number of dates a person tossed represented the number of
children he or she hoped the couple would have.</TE>
<TE>   Nellie loved hearing her mother talk about how one cousin put 13
dates into her skirt and how everyone laughed.</TE>
<TE>   She also liked to hear about how her father carried her mother on
his back, going in a circle. This custom showed that the husband
would support his wife during their life together.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: What other Korean customs and words will Nellie learn
to prepare for her grandfather's arrival?</TE>
<TE>   Tori Smith is a freelance writer from Tucson. She is the aunt of
two Korean American children. This story will be on The Times' Web
site at www.latimes.comkids.</TE>

<HD>Function at the Junction</HD>
<DH>A block party in Silver Lake brings together a colorful
gathering of the fashion rebellious</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The annual Sunset Junction Street Fair may be one of L.A.'s most
impressive gatherings of fashion tribes. Held this past weekend along
a strip of Sunset Boulevard in Silver Lake, it was a parade of the
tattooed, pierced and dreadlocked demonstrating the fine art of
getting dressed.</LD>
<LD>   The two-day affair began 22 years ago as a modest block party to
help alleviate tension in the diverse neighborhoods of Echo Park,
Silver Lake and Los Feliz, especially between gays and gangs. This
year, there were whirling carnival rides, booths selling everything
from roasted corn to bondage gear, and musical sets by headliners
Sonic Youth and Chaka Khan.</LD>
<LD>   But the real entertainment wasn't on the stage; it was on the
street as Goths, punks, leather-bound gays, hippies, frat boys and
fairy girls strutted around peacock-like--proof that there's more to
our homogenous Gap khaki, Nike running-shoe-wearing society after
all.</LD>
<TE>   In this enlightened age, when designers no longer have the power
to make women change the length of their hems from season to season,
it's tempting to believe that fashion is dead.</TE>
<TE>   But the sartorial circus of a street fair reminds us that clothes
are still a form of self-expression for those who care enough to
speak the language.</TE>

<LD>Show Me the Money</LD>
<LD>   Have you ever heard the sayings, "A fool and his money are soon
parted" or "Money doesn't grow on trees"? Money is very much a part
of our culture, but have you ever seen it used in works of art?</LD>
<LD>   Look at this paintbrush. It was made by artist Barton Benes from
real shredded money. Artists like Benes can get used dollars that
have been shredded from the Federal Reserve banks. In addition to
other things, these banks count and store our money and shred our old
bills.</LD>
<TE>   There are 12 Federal Reserve banks in the United States. Our money
is placed into circulation through depository institutions, which
obtain coins and currency from these banks.</TE>
<TE>   Want to learn more? Get a $1 bill--that's the one with our first
president, George Washington, on it. Turn to the front side. To the
left of Washington's head, you will see a letter in a circle. Read
the fine print around the letter to see which Federal Reserve bank it
came from. If it has an "L" on it, it is from the Federal Reserve
bank in San Francisco. An "H" means it's from St. Louis. See if you
can find others.</TE>
<TE>   Want to learn even more? See "Show Me the Money: The Dollar as Art
at the Palm Springs Desert Museum." The exhibition has paintings and
sculptures about money from the Federal Reserve Board collection,
through Sept. 15. You can see birds' nests, scepters and flags, all
made out of money. Seeing the exhibit will make you look more closely
at our currency and maybe ask some questions.</TE>

325-7186.</TE>

<HD>Ad Spending Poised for Growth</HD>
<DH>Media: With the fall TV season approaching, the networks
are seeing more interest from major advertisers that had been
expected to scale back.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Advertising spending is showing unexpected vitality in a lackluster
economy, led by broadcast television networks that have hiked their
rates by about 10% since early June.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, some analysts voiced concern that advertisers would
become skittish after the stock market plunge, followed by the
financial collapse of WorldCom Inc., whose MCI telephone service is a
leading advertiser. They predicted that some advertisers would cancel
or scale back on orders placed during the spring for commercial spots
on network TV.</LD>
<LD>   So far, that hasn't been the case.</LD>
<TE>   "There's more money coming into the market--it's amazing," said
Bill Cella, chairman of Magna Global USA, which negotiates ad
packages with networks on behalf of advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   "Advertising recovery usually comes two quarters after a recovery
in the general market. But it seems like a total reverse here," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The outlook appears to be improving across several media sectors.
CMR, a unit of Taylor Nelson Sofres, which tracks ad spending,
reported Monday that advertising spending for all media was down just
0.2%, to $53.7 billion, during the first half of 2002, compared with
a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Spending in network TV is up dramatically. The six major broadcast
networks booked a record $8.1 billion in advertising commitments for
the prime-time TV season that begins in mid-September.</TE>
<TE>   According to four key ad buyers, advertisers have been reaffirming
those orders placed during the so-called "upfront" sales season in
late May and early June, when about 80% of the network's prime-time
inventory is sold. In some cases, advertisers who wanted to expand
their orders were told they would have to pay the price.</TE>
<TE>   "If the networks extended the orders, they did it at a higher
price," said Tim Spengler, director of national broadcast for
Initiative Media, which handles network TV advertising for Home Depot
Inc., Bayer Corp., Bell South Corp. and Coors Brewing.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Shaw, ABC's president of sales and marketing, confirmed
Monday that the network's rates have climbed along with competing
networks since the upfront sales season closed in early June. Rates
for all of the networks have jumped by about 10% since June, TV
executives said, with some increases to new advertisers as high as
25% over the rates set during the upfront, according to WB
executives.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where the pricing will end up, but we feel pretty
good," Shaw said. "There's very limited inventory available."</TE>
<TE>   For example, the first two regular season games of ABC's "Monday
Night Football" are sold out, Shaw said. CBS and Fox Broadcasting Co.
executives said they've sold more than 85% of their spots for weekend
National Football League telecasts for the entire season. And CBS
executives said advertisers have expressed interest in college
basketball, which doesn't start until December.</TE>
<TE>   "Our pacing has been solid. We are today where we were last year
in mid-November," said Scott McGraw, CBS executive vice president for
network sports sales and marketing. "It's certainly a recovering
market."</TE>
<TE>   Advertisers' interest goes beyond sports. "It's prime-time,
daytime, news, sports, kids programming....All of the day parts seem
to be healthy," said ABC's Shaw. "This is broad-based strength."</TE>
<TE>   According to the CMR report, Spanish-language broadcasting posted
the greatest increase, 26.7% for the first half of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   That is not surprising given that advertisers have been flocking
to Spanish-language media, trying to harness the buying power of more
than 38 million Latinos living in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The radio and newspaper industries also showed gains. Radio
advertising moved up 7.5% over last year, and spending in newspapers
increased by 6.3%.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest declines in the first half were in
business-to-business magazines (down 20.8%) as several titles folded.
TV syndication was down 12.6% and cable TV fell by 9.7%. However,
some cable networks have reported an uptick in pricing since June.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors Corp., which spent $1.1 billion in six months,
continues to be the nation's top advertiser even though the auto
maker's spending was flat compared with the first half of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Motor Co. trimmed its ad budget by 8.8%, to $610 million, and
DaimlerChrysler cut its spending by 19.1%, to $583 million.</TE>
<TE>   Procter &amp; Gamble Co., the nation's second-largest advertiser,
increased spending 23.8%, to $966 million. AOL Time Warner Inc., the
nation's third-largest advertiser, increased ad spending by 3.6%, to
$753 million, in the first half. Walt Disney Co., the eighth-largest
advertiser, spent the same as the first half of 2001, or $506
million.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon Communications Inc. increased its ad budget by 38.4%, to
$541 million. Pfizer Inc., the maker of Viagra, increased spending
nearly 22%, to $497 million.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Morris Cos., the nation's fourth-largest advertiser, cut
its spending 16.5%, to $725 million.</TE>

<HD>Amazon Cuts Order Total for Free Shipping</HD>
<DH>Internet: Retailer reduces amount to $25 from $49 to boost
sales and attract customers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amazon.com Inc. cut in half the amount shoppers must spend to get
free shipping as the world's largest Internet retailer tries to boost
sales and gain customers.</LD>
<LD>   Shoppers who spend $25 or more for certain products get free
shipping under a test program, the company said. Amazon.com in June
reduced the minimum purchase required for free shipping to $49 from
$99.</LD>
<LD>   Free shipping is an attempt to turn browsers into buyers and get
customers to order more, the company has said.</LD>
<TE>   Amazon.com also expanded discounts in April, offering a 30% price
reduction on any book with a publisher's list price of more than $15.
The retailer previously offered the discount on books of more than
$20.</TE>
<TE>   "This is part of their broader strategy of lowering prices," said
Dan Geiman, a McAdams Wright Ragen analyst. Geiman has a "buy" rating
on Amazon shares and said he doesn't personally own the stock.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes &amp; Noble.com Inc., the second-largest U.S. Internet
bookstore, offers free shipping when customers buy at least two
items, with some exclusions, according to its Web site. The site, 36%
owned by Barnes &amp; Noble Inc., offers 40% discounts on bestsellers.</TE>
<TE>   Amazon's test of a $49 threshold for free shipping went well
enough for the company to lower it, Chief Executive Jeff Bezos wrote
in an e-mail to customers. He said the offer may be permanent,
depending on test results.</TE>
<TE>   Customers who opt for free shipping will have delivery times as
much as five days longer than Seattle-based Amazon.com's regular
services.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Amazon.com fell 24 cents to $14.93 and Barnes &amp;
Noble.com rose 2 cents to 75 cents, both on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Office Market Slump Weighing on Arden</HD>
<DH>The region's largest owner of such properties has watched
its occupancy and leasing rates slip</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Southern California's commercial property market continues to
sink, the real estate company with perhaps the most to lose is the
region's biggest owner of office space: Arden Realty Inc.</LD>
<LD>   All of the Los Angeles company's nearly 18 million square feet of
office space is in Southern California, which many mistakenly had
believed would avoid the worst of the slowdown that has hit
commercial real estate nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Arden and its rivals have watched the region's occupancy
and leasing rates deteriorate for more than two years, with no end in
sight.</LD>
<TE>   To the dismay of investors, Arden, a publicly traded real estate
investment trust, reduced its earnings and operating targets in the
first half of the year, and the company's property and leasing
managers will remain under tremendous pressure in coming months to
keep occupancy rates from sliding further.</TE>
<TE>   "It's being tested right now," said real estate securities analyst
David Shulman at Lehman Bros. "The company had the wind at its back
for a long time, and now they have the wind in front of them. Now we
will find out how good they are."</TE>
<TE>   Arden remains financially strong and continues to churn out
profit, generating $17.4 million in net income during the second
quarter. But company executives, like their peers at other property
companies, have been surprised by the depth and duration of the real
estate slump. Net income was $28 million in the second quarter of
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Hope for a market turnaround evaporated by midyear as the vacancy
rate at Arden's buildings hit approximately 10%--about double
year-earlier levels--and the company leased only 75,000 square feet
of space in June, far below expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not seen the level of business expansion and job growth
required to drive significant office demand," founder and Chairman
Richard S. Ziman said during a recent conference call with investment
analysts. "At this time, we see little short-term relief from these
market pressures."</TE>
<TE>   Arden's lackluster performance has forced many Wall Street
analysts to reduce their expectations for the company and the
region's office market. "We thought Southern California would be
holding up better," Shulman said.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Arden shares rose 16 cents to $24.60 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   During the real estate bust of the early 1990s, Ziman and Chief
Operating Officer Victor Coleman formed Arden by amassing a huge
portfolio of office buildings at bargain prices. That portfolio,
which consists of about 130 mostly suburban office buildings that are
leased primarily to smaller professional firms, generated impressive
year-over-year gains as the Southern California economy expanded
during the booming second half of the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   But strategies that served Arden well during boom times have not
insulated it from the market's downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Arden minimized its exposure to large corporate tenants that tie
up huge blocks of space by leasing to many small businesses--which
have proved especially vulnerable in the sluggish economy.</TE>
<TE>   Arden is retaining far fewer tenants than it has in the past, and
the leases it is signing are for spaces that are about 40% smaller
than the company's historical average. The company still is able to
raise rents when most leases expire, but the increases are only about
half as much as they were last year.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got smaller, regional tenants that are [not as] well-
capitalized" as larger firms, said Jim Bracken, an office real estate
industry analyst at Green Street Advisors in Newport Beach. "It's a
problem as the market weakens."</TE>
<TE>   The company also has suffered from its large presence in the
Westside and the South Bay, markets that have fallen sharply since
the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. At Howard Hughes Center in
Westchester, the company has failed to find tenants to fill 6100
Center Drive, a recently completed 12-story high-rise, despite
cutting rents by about 15%.</TE>
<TE>   "The activity is not that great," said Robert Peddicord, senior
vice president of leasing at Arden. "West L.A. was hit fairly hard by
the downturn."</TE>
<TE>   Peddicord said the company has intensified its focus on
stabilizing occupancy and retaining tenants, often contacting them
far in advance of their leases' expiration. In addition, it is
working to shorten the time necessary to complete the often-lengthy
leasing process. In one extreme case, Arden completed a lease for
1,000 square feet in about two hours.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't go out and create demand," Peddicord said. "You have to
focus on areas where you can make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Despite rising vacancy rates, Arden is committed to keeping a
sizable presence in key markets. The company recently agreed to

ensure that the company is prepared for the long term when the office
market rebounds.</TE>

<HD>International Banks Pledge to Maintain Support for Brazil</HD>
<DH>Economy: Commitment is seen as an important step toward
repairing investor confidence before October election.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SCHNEIDER and NICHOLA GROOM</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A group of leading international banks Monday vowed to sustain their
general level of business in Brazil, a move that bolstered faith in
the South American nation's markets ravaged by uncertainty ahead of
the October presidential vote.</LD>
<LD>   The 16 banks, including Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase and
Deutsche Bank, said in a statement they were committed to Brazil and
its economic program over the long term. They also vowed to maintain
trade credit lines with Latin America's largest economy, where
companies have seen credit dry up amid the market turmoil.</LD>
<LD>   Brazilian Central Bank head Arminio Fraga said the banks'
commitment represented an important step toward repairing investor
confidence, which has been severely damaged in recent months by
mounting worries over the two left-leaning front-runners' gaping lead
in the polls over Wall Street favorite Jose Serra.</LD>
<TE>   "We do not expect this meeting to be a solution in itself to all
the anxieties out there," Fraga told reporters at the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, where the meeting between the bankers and Brazilian
officials took place.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe this is one more step in the direction of demonstrating
that this is a country moving in the right direction," Fraga said.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street has been worrying for months that if one of the
left-leaning front-runners--Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva or Ciro
Gomes--is elected president, he could mishandle the economy and push
the country toward a default on its $250-billion net public debt. The
concerns have sunk Brazilian bonds some 20% this year and weighed on
Brazil's currency, the real.</TE>
<TE>   The market turbulence already has prompted promises of cash from
another key lender, the International Monetary Fund, which unveiled a
$30-billion aid package this month. The deal appeared to be moving
forward Monday; IMF sources told Reuters the lender had hammered out
the fine print and the IMF executive board would review the loan
agreement Sept. 6.</TE>
<TE>   But it is Brazilian firms' cash crunch that has been on investors'
minds in recent days, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Trade-related credit lines to Brazil have dropped by about $3
billion to $13 billion overall in the last six months, and terms of
some of the credits have been drastically shortened, crimping
companies' export capabilities, said Fitch Ratings on a recent
conference call.</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts were not expecting a blockbuster announcement from
the banks worth billions of dollars in new credit lines, especially
in light of their sharp losses after Argentina's devaluation and
default earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Economists said Fraga and Finance Minister Pedro Malan had made
reassuring comments. Investment bankers who held separate talks with
Fraga on Monday called their meetings "positive."</TE>
<TE>   But some cautioned that a lack of specifics from the banks would
do little to radically ease the market's persistent uncertainties.</TE>
<TE>   "Fraga said the meetings were positive, but it's difficult to say
whether that translates into hard credit lines or not," said Siobhan
Manning, Latin American debt strategist at Caboto. "I don't think
these comments show a concrete deal."</TE>
<TE>   In Brazilian markets, the real strengthened 2% against the dollar,
while the benchmark Bovespa stock index soared 4.35% after the talks.</TE>
<TE>   Fraga said that although the banks made a general commitment to
Brazil, some banks were considering doing more. He added that he
expected a greater level of bank commitment as confidence improves.</TE>

<BD>Dow Jones/Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc. said it had received notice from
Nasdaq that its shares are subject to delisting because it didn't
file its second-quarter report with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on time.</LD>
<LD>   The news sent Gemstar's stock down to as low as $3.65 in
after-hours trading. The shares had closed up 20 cents at $4.48 on
Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   Gemstar, which is in the midst of a change in leadership, said
this month that it would have to restate its 2001 results "to reverse
the recognition" of about $20 million in revenue at its TV Guide
unit.</LD>
<TE>   Gemstar also was one of 16 companies that didn't meet the SEC's
Aug. 14 mandate to certify its financial results.</TE>
<TE>   The Pasadena-based provider of TV program guides said it had
requested a hearing on the delisting.</TE>

until it restates results for 2000, 2001 and the quarter ended March

<LD>Voit Development Co. is buying a 22-acre parcel adjacent to the
Burbank Airport where the company will develop a $40-million,
450,000-square-foot industrial business park.</LD>
<LD>   The site, formerly part of the Lockheed B-6 facility, is being
sold by the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority for $16.3
million.</LD>
<LD>   The parcel became available for sale after the airport authority
failed to obtain approval from the city of Burbank to build a
passenger terminal.</LD>
<TE>   Voit will build nine free-standing buildings designed by Ware
Malcomb for sale or lease ranging from 40,000 to 70,000 square feet,

Construction is expected to begin early next year, and the first
225,000 square feet should be complete eight months later.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>MTV Networks has leased an additional 45,000 square feet to expand
its headquarters in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   The broadcaster will take over the three-story building at 1633
26th St. in a four-year deal. Landlord Kilroy Realty Corp. will add a
connecting walkway to the 106,000 square feet of offices MTV has at
2600 Colorado Ave.</LD>
<LD>   MTV will consolidate offices in other locations into the building
on 26th Street by the end of the year, said Brad Feld of Cushman &amp;
Wakefield Inc., who represented the tenant. He declined to specify
the value of the lease but said, "It was a win-win for both parties
in a slow market with very little leasing velocity."</LD>
<TE>   Real estate data provider CoStar Group Inc. said the asking rent
at 1633 26th St. was $2 per square foot per month. At that rate, the
lease would be valued at more than $4.3 million.</TE>

<HD>Fitch Downgrades Disney's Debt</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: ABC's ratings and the cost of acquiring Fox
Family are cited. The media giant says problems won't last.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fitch Ratings on Monday downgraded its rating on Walt Disney Co.,
citing the company's debt, the struggling ABC television network and
the falloff in the company's theme park business.</LD>
<LD>   Fitch cut its rating on Disney's unsecured debt from A-minus to
BBB-plus, Fitch's third-lowest investment grade. The lowering affects
about $14 billion in debt.</LD>
<LD>   The action could marginally raise Disney's borrowing costs by
increasing the interest rates the company pays on its debt, analysts
said. The move brought little reaction on Wall Street, with Disney's
stock falling 16 cents to $16.67 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   The rating firm cited the firm's higher debt from the $5.2-billion
acquisition of the Fox Family Worldwide cable business in October and
"the declining operating performance of Disney's businesses."</TE>
<TE>   Fitch pointed to the continued ratings slide at ABC, a mixed
record at the box office and declines in the company's theme park
business because of the recession and the effects of Sept. 11. Fitch
credited Disney's management, however, for making strides in reducing
its expenditures, which are declining to $1.25 billion in fiscal 2002
from $1.8 billion in fiscal 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "We have worked to reduce sharply our debt levels this year, and
we are comfortable with our ability to handle our obligations and
confident in the overall strength of our balance sheet and our
liquidity," Disney spokesman John Spelich said.</TE>
<TE>   Disney sees the Fitch action "as the result of short-term business
conditions. We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for
the Walt Disney Co.," Spelich said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the downgrade, the company's overall balance sheet remains
healthy, said Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with Gerard Klauer
Mattison.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services
also have signaled that they may lower their ratings on Disney's
senior debt.</TE>

<HD>Sales of New Homes in the U.S. Reach All-Time Highs in July</HD>
<DH>Economy: Market for existing houses rebounds and California
sees a 7.5% increase.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Motivated by low mortgage rates, house hunters across the nation
turned into buyers, sending new-home sales in July to the highest
monthly level on record and giving a solid boost to sales of
previously owned homes.</LD>
<LD>   Housing reports released Monday, provided good news for the
economic recovery, which has been advancing in fits and starts.</LD>
<LD>   Sales of new homes in July climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 1.02 million, a record sales pace and a 6.7% increase from
June's level, the Commerce Department reported Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Sales of existing homes--the biggest slice of the housing
market--rebounded in July, rising 4.5% from the previous month to a
rate of 5.33 million units, according to the National Assn. of
Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   In California, sales rose 7.5% in July to 540,800 at a seasonally
adjusted annualized rate, and the median price of an existing home
rose 21%, to $323,700 from $267,520 a year earlier, the California
Assn. of Realtors reported. It was the fifth month in the last six in
which prices have risen by 20% or more in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, the average price of a new home in July was $215,200,
up 2.8% from the same month last year. But the median price--meaning
half sold for more and half sold for less--was $170,500, a 2.6%
decline from a year ago. The median price of an existing home was
$162,800 in July, a 7.3% increase from the same month a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   One of the bright spots of the economic recovery has been the
housing market, which performed well even during last year's
recession, largely because of low mortgage rates.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was
6.49%, down from 6.65% in June and well below the 7.13% rate for July
a year ago, according to mortgage company Freddie Mac. Last week,
rates on 30-year mortgages edged up to 6.27%, after dipping to a
32-year low the previous week.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor motivating home buyers: solid appreciation in
housing values. That offers people an attractive investment,
especially given the volatility of the stock market, economists said.</TE>
<TE>   In July, those factors offset potentially negative ones, including
eroding consumer confidence and a stagnant job market.</TE>
<TE>   "Things couldn't be better on the financing side. We're seeing
strong upward movements in house values in most places, and I also
think we're still seeing a rally around hearth and home that followed
the 9/11 terrorist attacks," said David Seiders, chief economist at
the National Assn. of Home Builders.</TE>
<TE>   However, in June, new-home sales fell 2.6% and existing-home sales
plunged 11.1% as worries about jobs, the roller-coaster stock market
and the direction of the economy seemed to weigh heavily on
prospective buyers. Yet, even with the declines, the level of sales
remained healthy.</TE>
<TE>   Economists believe new-home and existing-home sales will set
records this year. Seiders predicts new-home sales will hit 936,000.
David Lereah, chief economist for the National Assn. of Realtors, is
projecting existing-home sales to reach 5.44 million.</TE>
<TE>   Growth in new-home sales in July was not uniform across the
country. In the Midwest, sales soared 16% to a rate of 203,000, the
highest level since December 1993. In the South, sales jumped 10.1%
to a rate of 470,000, the highest level since November. But in the
Northeast, new-home sales fell by 9.1% to a rate of 60,000, and in
the West, they dipped by 0.4% to a rate of 284,000.</TE>

<HD>Enron Creditors Seek $12 Million</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Ex-executive Michael Kopper is sued for funds that
he agreed to forfeit to the U.S. as part of a guilty plea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Enron Corp.'s creditors filed a lawsuit in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
seeking $12 million that former executive Michael J. Kopper has
agreed to turn over to the government.</LD>
<LD>   Kopper pleaded guilty last week to fraud and money-laundering
charges and agreed to surrender $12 million he admitted to obtaining
illegally. Enron's LJM2 Capital unit, which Kopper managed, controls
about $4 million of the total.</LD>
<LD>   Enron's creditors' committee Monday sued Kopper and LJM2 to
recover the money and help repay some of the more than $50 billion
they say they're owed. The creditors want to force the government to
relinquish control over Kopper's illegal gains. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Arthur J. Gonzalez in Manhattan froze the funds pending a hearing on
the lawsuit scheduled for Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "The $12 million that Kopper and LJM2 hold that he now seeks to
turn over to the government should be possessed by Enron," the
creditors' committee said in court papers. "Kopper would be unjustly
enriched if he were permitted to turn over Enron's property" to
anyone else, the panel said.</TE>
<TE>   The creditors' panel said the judge must act quickly, before
Kopper turns the money over to government officials.</TE>
<TE>   Kopper, who managed partnerships allegedly used to hide $1 billion
in Enron losses, agreed to cooperate with U.S. investigators and
implicated former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow in an
alleged scheme to defraud the energy company's investors.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors want to seize $23 million from bank accounts of Fastow
and other former Enron employees, along with a house Fastow is
building.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow made more than $30 million from investments in the
partnerships and Kopper and his domestic partner, William Dodson,
made more than $10 million, according to a report in February by a
special committee of Enron's board.</TE>
<TE>   Court papers disclosed that the government is seeking to seize two
Fastow family bank accounts with $9.1 million and one in the name of
a family foundation with $4.6 million. The government wants to seize
a home Fastow is building in the affluent River Oaks section of
Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The government also is seeking bank accounts with more than $1.6
million from former Enron lawyer Kristina Mordaunt, who shared in
some of the partnership proceeds, and her home, and $916,137 from
former Enron Treasurer Ben F. Glisan Jr. The government also wants to
seize a Lexus owned by Mordaunt's husband, court papers said.</TE>

<HD>TV Veteran Steps Into Newspaper Family Drama</HD>
<DH>Media: Alan Bell is praised for his ability to bring people
together--a skill he'll surely need as Freedom's CEO.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1970, Alan J. Bell got his first big professional break when he
became general manager of WJZ-TV in Baltimore, then an ABC affiliate.
Discouraged by the shape he found the station in, Bell complained to
his mother that he had inherited a mess.</LD>
<LD>   "You jerk," Bell, laughing, remembers her firing back. "If there
were no messes, you wouldn't have a job."</LD>
<LD>   Bell said he then turned the station around and boosted ratings.
He went on to hold several important broadcasting positions ranging
from president of Lorimar Broadcast Group, a unit of Lorimar, the
producer of such TV shows as "Dallas" and "Falcon Crest," to
assistant general manager of KTTV-TV Channel 11 in Los Angeles. Now,
the Boston native and Harvard graduate faces what might be the
biggest challenge in his 70 years.</LD>
<TE>   Bell last week was named the new chief executive of Freedom
Communications Inc., the Irvine-based parent of the Orange County
Register. He takes over a family-owned company beset by infighting
and schisms.</TE>
<TE>   Bell assumed the top spot after his predecessor, Samuel Wolgemuth,
resigned under pressure from the Hoiles family, owner of the closely
held company. Shareholders had blamed Wolgemuth for millions of
dollars of losses related to failed magazine ventures.</TE>
<TE>   A "TV guy through and through," in the words of former Freedom
Chief Operating Officer Joseph Barletta, Bell now leads the nation's
12th-largest newspaper company. In addition to 28 daily newspapers,
Freedom owns 37 weeklies and eight television stations.</TE>
<TE>   Before being named to his new job, Bell oversaw the TV stations as
president of Freedom's broadcasting division. Despite his lack of
print background, Barletta and others call Bell a quick learner and
predict success. They also say that his 13 years at Freedom have
prepared him for the job.</TE>
<TE>   CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves, a former colleague at Lorimar,
said Bell has the ability to bring people together--an invaluable
skill in his new job. "He knows how to get the troops pointed in the
right direction," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But some experts speculate that Freedom's board might have tapped
Bell to dress up the company's television stations in preparation for
a sale. Media analyst John Morton said Freedom probably would sell
off its TV assets, if it decides to sell anything.</TE>
<TE>   Given the company's debt, estimated by company insiders at $400
million, Morton thinks it's unlikely Bell will go on a major shopping
spree any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Monday, Bell said no decisions had been made about
how to restructure the company and that he was not hired to sell off
the three ABC and five CBS affiliates.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't brought on to sell any assets at this point," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Given his deep roots in television, the challenge of running a
newspaper company would be daunting enough. However, Bell is stepping
into a squabble among Hoiles shareholders that threatens to tear
apart both the company and the family.</TE>
<TE>   Unhappy with their modest returns, several shareholders have said
they want to sell some of their holdings. Board member Tim Hoiles, a
grandson of founder Raymond Cyrus Hoiles and an 8.6% owner, said
Monday that "parts of the business, especially the Orange County
Register, are under-performing and have been for 20 years. Many
people want out."</TE>
<TE>   A standard bearer of libertarianism and Freedom's crown jewel, the
Register is believed to have an operating profit margin of less than
15%. That contrasts with an average operating margin of more than 21%
at the nation's publicly traded newspaper companies.</TE>
<TE>   The paper's circulation has dropped by 8% in two years to about
315,000. The fall is attributed to a reduction in door-to-door
promotional visits and because the Register is no longer delivered to
homes outside Orange County, spokeswoman Nancy Souza said.</TE>
<TE>   Bell said he hoped to improve the paper's financial situation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no secret we need to make the Register more efficient and
its margins better," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After a disappointing 2001 in which Freedom lost $110 million
before taxes largely because of magazine and Internet operations, the
company is regaining ground.</TE>
<TE>   In the first six months, Freedom posted a pretax profit of $23
million, compared with a $55-million loss in the same period a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The ire of dissident shareholders such as Tim Hoiles
notwithstanding, the appointment of Bell, who joined Freedom in 1989,
appears to have cooled passions among directors and shareholders,
said a board member who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Because he is a "known commodity" who enjoys widespread respect,
the board member said, Bell would be given the chance to oversee a
transfer of ownership from third-generation shareholders such as Tim
Hoiles to fourth-generation members, now in their 20s and 30s. Some
question whether the Young Turks will succeed in finding a way to buy
out their elders short of selling off big chunks of Freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Bell said the company's owners would decide how to restructure it.
He also said he would serve for as long as they wanted him to,
although a change in Freedom's "capital structure" possibly could
affect his position.</TE>
<TE>   Media analyst Morton said he doubted Bell would preside over the
dismantling of Freedom's newspaper empire. "Owning a newspaper isn't
like owning a green bean cannery," said Morton, who believes that
Freedom could fetch $1.5 billion to $2 billion on the open market.
"There's a deep emotional connection to it."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Pryor, an assistant professor of journalism at the USC
Annenberg School for Communication, said that it was impossible to
divine the company's fate because even the Hoileses are undecided. If
they choose to ready the entire business for sale, though, he would
expect them to cut production costs, lay off employees and even
shrink the size of the paper to boost profit and make it more
attractive to potential suitors.</TE>
<TE>   In the long run, Pryor said, he thinks Freedom could break apart
under the stress of dissident shareholders, as have other
family-owned newspaper companies.</TE>
<TE>   That's largely what happened at Los Angeles Times parent Times
Mirror Co., which Tribune Co. bought two years ago from the Chandlers,
Pryor said.  A similar scenario played out more than a decade earlier with
the Louisville Courier Journal, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were looking at the tea leaves, yes, I'd say this is the end
of family-owned" Freedom, Pryor said.</TE>

<HD>NYSE Chief Failed to Disclose Stock Pay</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York Stock Exchange Chairman Richard Grasso failed to meet
financial disclosure requirements over the last five years relating
to his position as a director of Computer Associates International
Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Grasso and four other Computer Associates directors, including
former New York Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, didn't include
information on stock compensation in year-end reports required by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Computer Associates said the directors relied on the company's
mistaken legal advice.</LD>
<TE>   Grasso filed a catch-up report this month, disclosing stock awards
dating back to August 1996. In Computer Associates' proxy filing to
shareholders, the Islandia, N.Y., software maker also cited Grasso
and the other directors as delinquent filers.</TE>
<TE>   "No insider ever wants to see his name in a proxy statement listed
as someone who didn't comply with the law," said attorney Peter Romeo
of Hogan &amp; Hartson. A spokesman for Grasso, who is stepping down from
the Computer Associates board this year, declined to comment. The
NYSE sets corporate governance rules for its 2,800 listed companies.</TE>
<TE>   Attached to Grasso's late filing was a letter from Computer
Associates' general counsel saying the company had reversed legal
advice and concluded that a deferred stock plan for directors
required reporting to the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Timeliness of insider filings became an issue when President Bush
called for prompt disclosure of insider trades to improve corporate
accountability. Bush then came under criticism himself for reporting
his 1990 sale of stock at Harken Energy Corp. more than eight months
late. The SEC rarely takes action against late filers.</TE>

<HD>Nestle Offer for Hershey Reported</HD>
<DH>Candy: Trustees who control the U.S. chocolate maker are
said to be growing less inclined to sell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE McLEAN and COURTNEY SCHLISSERMAN</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Nestle, the Swiss food and beverage giant, reportedly has made an
$11.5-billion preliminary bid for Hershey Foods Corp., the biggest
U.S. chocolate maker whose trustees are now said to be growing less
inclined to sell the venerable company.</LD>
<LD>   The news, based on two published reports Monday, sent shares of
Pennsylvania-based Hershey up 2.4%, gaining $1.77 to $76.80 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   Nestle, which makes Crunch and Smarties candies, plans to offer
$82 to $85 a share for Hershey, USA Today reported. Executives from
the world's largest food maker toured Hershey factories twice last
week and looked at Hershey's accounts, the newspaper said.</LD>
<TE>   If Nestle were to complete the deal, it would overtake Mars Inc.
as well as gain the top spot in the U.S. chocolate market. Hershey
brands include Reese's peanut butter cups and, of course, Hershey
chocolate bars.</TE>
<TE>   Nestle has spent more than $14 billion in the last year on
takeovers, including the addition of Ralston Purina pet foods in the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever buys Hershey would gain sales of $4.56 billion and 43.1%
of the U.S. chocolate market. For Nestle, with 9.3% of the U.S.
market last year, the purchase would put it ahead of Mars, which has
26.7%.</TE>
<TE>   But a Nestle-Hershey combination would draw scrutiny from
antitrust enforcers because the two companies together would control
more than 50% of the U.S. chocolate market, antitrust lawyer Robert
Burka pointed out.</TE>
<TE>   Hershey spokesman John Long and Nestle spokesman Marcel Rubin
declined to comment on the USA Today report. Rubin said there's been
"no denial or confirmation." He repeated that Nestle wants to regain
a U.S. license for KitKat chocolate that was granted to Hershey.</TE>
<TE>   Nestle could regain KitKat, its best-selling chocolate brand
worldwide, without buying Hershey. The North American licensing
contract for KitKat has a change-of-control clause and needs to be
renegotiated if Hershey gets a new owner, Nestle has said.</TE>
<TE>   However, support for the proposed sale of Hershey is waning among
the trustees who control the company, the Wall Street Journal
reported. Two of the 17 trustees voted in March against a sale, and
others are now wavering.</TE>
<TE>   One board member sent letters to more than a dozen people saying
the board isn't committed to a sale, the Journal said. Most trustees
want to see how much they could get for the company.</TE>
<TE>   Other potential bidders include Kraft Foods, a unit of Philip
Morris Cos., and Cadbury Schweppes, the Journal said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the charitable trust that controls Hershey said last month
it would put the candy maker up for sale, state lawmakers have
opposed the idea because of concern about potential job losses.</TE>
<TE>   Pennsylvania Atty. Gen. Michael Fisher is seeking a temporary
court injunction to prevent any sale.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, attorneys for Hershey told a Pennsylvania court that
the attorney general's office overstepped its bounds in trying to
halt any sale. Another hearing is scheduled for Sept. 3.</TE>
<TE>   One member of the trust's board has said the trust may end up
allowing Hershey to buy back shares rather than sell the 108-year-old
company.</TE>

<HD>Wall St. Closes Up in Light Trading</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks rose Monday in one of the lightest trading days of the year as
investors eyed the bright spots in a mixed bag of comments by Wall
Street analysts, but remained cautious after five straight weeks of
gains.</LD>
<LD>   Trading volume was thin--with many investment firms lightly
staffed in the waning days of Wall Street's traditional summer
doldrums--and that made for a volatile session.</LD>
<LD>   "It's as thin as a razor, and any old widow in Pasadena trying to
sell 100 shares is going to move the market," said Jon Brorson,
director of equities for Northern Trust.</LD>
<TE>   Wall Street, shaky after taking a tumble Friday, drew comfort
early in the session from fresh data showing the housing sector
blazing ahead. But the market zigzagged in the afternoon before
surging just before the close.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 46.05 points, or 0.5%, to
8,919.01, after falling 117 points earlier in the session. The Dow
slid 180 points Friday on fears of slowing economic growth and
renewed worries about corporate corruption.</TE>
<TE>   The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 7.09 points, or 0.8%,
to 947.95, and the tech-laden Nasdaq composite index gained 11.12
points, or 0.8%, to 1,391.74.</TE>
<TE>   Although trading volume was light, breadth was strongly positive,
with winners beating losers by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by close to that ratio on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks have raced higher in recent weeks, lifting the broad market
nearly 19% from the multiyear trough hit in late July. But investors
remain skittish with clear signs of a strong economic upturn yet to
emerge.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a good rally in the market without a lot of economic
data that would show that the economy's accelerating, so it's going
to be hard to keep the market going," said John Forelli at
Independence Investment.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, investors took heart from a report that sales of new
homes shot up in July--easily surpassing analysts estimates--as low
mortgage rates added fuel to a sizzling housing market.</TE>
<TE>   Weakness in semiconductor stocks kept the market under pressure,
however, after two brokerage houses cut their ratings on companies in
the chip sector. Bear Stearns cut its rating of chip maker Fairchild
Semiconductor International, citing likely delays in earnings growth.
Fairchild fell $1.20 to $13.45.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon Smith Barney cut its ratings of Agere Systems and Applied
Micro Circuits, citing ongoing risks and the lack of catalysts for
either company beyond their attractive valuation. Agere, which makes
semiconductors and optical components, fell 7 cents to $1.67. Applied
Micro sagged 22 cents to $4.45.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading, oil climbed 65 cents a barrel to $29.28 in New
York trading on tensions between the U.S. and Iraq. Gold gained $2.70
to $309.40 an ounce. The dollar was little changed against the euro
and Japanese yen. Yields on Treasury securities were flat.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights Monday:</TE>
<TE>   * Calpine rose 75 cents, or 15%, to $5.75 after the power producer
raised $138 million from Canadian investors and banks agreed to lend
it $105 million to complete construction of a power plant in
Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   * AOL Time Warner, plagued in recent days by concerns about a
federal inquiry into its finances, was the NYSE's most actively
traded stock, falling 46 cents to $12.30.</TE>
<TE>   * Ciena buoyed Nasdaq after the communications equipment maker was
upgraded by Soundview Technology, putting a shine on other sector
heavyweights such as JDS Uniphase and Corning. Ciena gained 23 cents
to $4.39, JDS Uniphase rose 26 cents to $3.30 and Corning rose 26
cents to $2.22.</TE>
<TE>   * Weighing on the Dow was Boeing, which eased 24 cents to $36.89.
One analyst said the decline follows Boeing's proposal in labor talks
Friday of an all-in-one contract that would include pay increases and
higher pension contributions. The union rejected the proposal.</TE>

<HD>Nasdaq Has High Hopes for New Trading System</HD>
<DH>Securities: The market's president says the upgrade will
play critical role in long-term success.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>During the height of the bull market, Nasdaq ran ads proclaiming
itself the stock market for the next 100 years.</LD>
<LD>   But the new century is off to a rough start for the No. 2 U.S.
equity-trading venue.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street's plunge since March 2000 has decimated the big
technology stocks for which Nasdaq is best known. And its overseas
ventures have suffered deep losses, forcing the planned closure of
its once highly touted Japanese trading operation.</LD>
<TE>   Now Nasdaq, under Chairman Hardwick Simmons and President Richard
G. Ketchum, is pinning its hopes for growth in part on a revamped
electronic trading system, known as SuperMontage, which is intended
to lure business back from rival trading networks that have sprung up
in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to vote
Wednesday on final approval for SuperMontage. Nasdaq plans to roll
out the system almost immediately if the SEC gives its OK.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times, Ketchum said SuperMontage is
critical for the market's long-term success.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers say the early reviews that traders and investors
give SuperMontage also could be critical in determining Nasdaq's
timetable for its long-planned initial public stock offering.</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq is spinning itself off from the National Assn. of
Securities Dealers into a private, for-profit company and hopes one
day to enjoy a glitzy IPO.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of two private-placement stock sales, some Nasdaq
shares recently began trading on the electronic Bulletin Board, a
market considered a rung below the main Nasdaq market. Nasdaq
officials frowned on the decision of the private-placement
shareowners to trade the stock, fearing it could crimp the IPO plans.</TE>
<TE>   The shares (ticker symbol: NDAQ) traded as high as $15.50 on July
10 but have since fallen to $10.87 as of Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Ketchum, in the interview, discussed SuperMontage, the IPO plans
and other issues facing Nasdaq. Excerpts:</TE>
<TE>   Question: Do you think the image of Nasdaq, which was closely
associated with the "new economy" and with tech stocks, has been
damaged by the long decline in that market sector?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Undoubtedly, there will always be some impact when your
index and many of your companies have lost a significant amount of
their value over a period of time. But if I ever have to have a
choice between being involved with a large percentage of companies
that are redefining their sector or industry--whether that be
technology, biotechnology or Starbucks--I'll take bets on those
companies.</TE>
<TE>   I don't feel there's any less interest in Nasdaq, either in the
U.S. or globally. People still believe in a lot of the major
companies in our market. They may be wiser and may ask a lot more
questions about valuation than they used to. But they still believe
in them.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What was the rationale for Nasdaq trying to establish a
foothold in Japan?</TE>
<TE>   A: We thought, as a number of analysts did three years ago, that
Japan, which had performed well the year before, was finally moving
out of a decade of recession and bad markets and was finally going to
be an effective economic performer. We had started to see that with a
run of IPOs that were coming out of Japan at that point.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What happened?</TE>
<TE>   A: We were wrong. The macroeconomic disaster that has been Japan
has continued. That's created an environment where the number of new
companies able to come to the market and the return of retail
investors that we counted on just haven't happened. Beyond that, it
is not an easy thing for a non-Japanese company, much less a
non-Japanese market, to effectively enter into Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You still have trading ventures in Europe and Canada. Does the
closure of Nasdaq-Japan mean you're altering your global aspirations?</TE>
<TE>   A: We are dead-bang focused domestically as the primary growth
opportunity for Nasdaq. We haven't given up our vision that markets
will be global. But our future is in making sure we provide [needed
services] in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What is your timetable for doing a Nasdaq IPO?</TE>
<TE>   A: We're not going to rush. It seems highly unlikely that we'll do
an IPO this year. From the first quarter of next year on, we'll make
the decision when the time seems right. We haven't changed our view
that we think [an IPO] is a good thing. It's just a matter of timing.
We don't plan to be a Bulletin Board company forever. We expect to be
a listed company.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How important is the new SuperMontage trading system from a
strategic standpoint?</TE>
<TE>   A: Very important, for two reasons. One, it makes the market
better, and we're only going to succeed if we keep making the market
better. SuperMontage opens a window onto the trading of securities
that hasn't been there before. It allows people to truly see what's
available to buy and sell in the market in a single glance, and
that's critical. Two, because it allows us to compete more
effectively in the markets. It allows us to offer something that no
other market at this point has to offer.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Your expectations for SuperMontage are that the system itself
will encourage more trading, thus boosting Nasdaq's revenue and
earnings. Is that realistic?</TE>
<TE>   A: Any time you give investors more transparency, they're more
likely to trade. SuperMontage will create a more transparent, deeper,
more liquid market that people can see more clearly and be confident
is fair. And when you do those things, people will trade more. That
will encourage more people to use Nasdaq systems.</TE>
<TE>   SuperMontage will result in our systems being used a higher
percentage of time than they are now. When Nasdaq systems use
increases, we will benefit from that. We will grab market share. And
we think investors will trade more because they'll see more of the
market picture.</TE>
<TE>   The last piece is that SuperMontage will generate valuable
information that's never been available in the securities markets
before, and we hope that will provide us valuable securities products
to sell.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Nasdaq recently proposed corporate governance rules that would
require Nasdaq-listed companies to adopt reforms such as shareholder
approval of stock option plans. But despite many calls for mandating
the formal expensing of stock options, you have opposed that idea.
Why?</TE>
<TE>   A: We really do worry that the type of companies in California as
a whole and Southern California in particular--companies that have
challenged the old-line and created innovative products--are not
sitting there with inexhaustible amounts of capital. And the way
they're able to compete and attract quality people is to use stock
options as a way to have people give up short-term compensation for
the opportunity of long-term gains. I think that's worked pretty well
for America.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What about complaints that executives abuse the system?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's not to say there haven't been instances of abuses. But the
way you solve that is with disclosure and shareholder voting. We
would prefer not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. We believe
there needs to be greater controls, and that's why we've got the
shareholder vote [proposal].</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SuperMontage, Nasdaq's planned upgrade for its trading system, is the
No. 2 U.S. stock market's attempt at rebuffing a new generation of
electronic rivals.</LD>
<LD>   Nasdaq says the system will give trading firms and investors a
more complete picture of the market at any moment--theoretically
improving their chances of getting the best possible buy or sell
prices for Nasdaq shares.</LD>
<LD>   Currently, Nasdaq computer terminals display the best buy and sell
quotes from each dealer ("market maker") in Nasdaq shares.</LD>
<TE>   With SuperMontage, more market-maker quotes will be displayed for
each stock, improving the market's "depth," Nasdaq says. What's more,
the system can include quotes available through Nasdaq's rivals,
so-called ECNs, or electronic communications networks, which match
buyers with sellers.</TE>
<TE>   SuperMontage also is designed to fully automate the execution of
orders to make sure they are handled faster and more reliably.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Nasdaq has faced growing competition from ECNs,
which have pitched themselves to investors as cheaper and quicker
trading systems than Nasdaq. SuperMontage is aimed at taking back
market share lost to the ECNs.</TE>
<TE>   SuperMontage has been a long time in coming. It was first proposed
in 1999 and has gone through a variety of iterations to address
complaints from lawmakers, consumer groups and ECNs.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by the SEC on Wednesday, Nasdaq would launch
SuperMontage on Sept. 9 and roll it out over the following month.</TE>

<HD>Qwest Unit Plans Junk Bond Sale</HD>
<DH>Deals: The $1-billion issue this fall would help finance
buyout of QwestDex, source says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN STEMPEL</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc.'s phone book unit, QwestDex,
is planning an October sale of as much as $1 billion of junk bonds to
help finance its $7.05-billion takeover by two leveraged buyout
firms, a person familiar with the matter said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Carlyle Group Inc. and Welsh, Carson, Anderson &amp; Stowe agreed to
pay $2.75 billion in cash for QwestDex's Eastern U.S. operations and
$4.3 billion for its Western U.S. operations.</LD>
<LD>   The leveraged buyout would be the second-largest after Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s $31.4-billion purchase of RJ Reynolds Nabisco
in 1989.</LD>
<TE>   The junk bond sale would be the largest since Owens-Brockway Glass
Container Inc., a division of Owens-Illinois Inc., sold $1 billion
worth in January. Junk, or non-investment-grade, bonds have suffered
in 2002 as investors have balked at buying them, wary of record
defaults as more debt-laden companies have filed for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "A $1-billion high-yield deal is a big deal in any market," said
Brendan White, a senior portfolio manager at Fort Washington
Investment Advisors in Cincinnati, which owns some Qwest bonds. It's
unclear how much QwestDex would have to pay to attract investors,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Yields on many existing junk bonds now are above 12%.</TE>
<TE>   Junk bond mutual funds have suffered investor redemptions for 11
straight weeks, AMG Data Services said. That has removed a key group
of buyers from the market.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, junk bond prices rebounded somewhat last week,
pushing yields down a bit.</TE>
<TE>   Companies have sold just $3.1 billion of new junk bonds since June
30, the weakest start to a quarter since the third quarter of 1996,
according to Dealogic.</TE>
<TE>   QwestDex sells advertising in 269 directories in 14 states, with a
circulation of 45 million. Its bond sale would be the first of two by
the company that could raise nearly $3 billion, the person familiar
with the matter said. QwestDex might tap the leveraged loan market
for about $3 billion and issue $1 billion of equity, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Denver-based Qwest, the No. 4 U.S. local phone firm,
were down 2 cents to $2.67 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc. invested $30 million to $50 million in Oxygen
Media Inc., a women-focused cable channel that agreed to buy $100
million in advertising on America Online, the Wall Street Journal
said.</LD>
<LD>   AOL Time Warner also arranged for Oxygen to be carried on its
cable systems, the paper said, citing Lisa Gersh Hall, Oxygen's chief
operating officer. AOL Time Warner's internal investigators are
examining transactions with Oxygen and similar ones as part of an
inquiry into possible accounting problems at the America Online unit,
the paper said.</LD>
<LD>   These types of transactions, in which America Online invested in a
company or purchased goods and services in exchange for advertising
business, aren't necessary problematic as long as the company placed
fair value on the assets exchanged, the paper reported, citing
unidentified accounting experts.</LD>

<HD>Amerco Says It Is Unaware of SEC Probe</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amerco, parent of U-Haul International Inc., said it was unaware of
any investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission over the
firing of auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers and other issues.</LD>
<LD>   The Financial Times reported that the SEC contacted Amerco about
last month's dismissal of its auditor of 24 years.</LD>
<LD>   Regulators are looking into financial control issues at the
company, the paper said, citing unidentified people close to the
probe.</LD>
<TE>   Representatives for the SEC and PricewaterhouseCoopers declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Amerco fired PricewaterhouseCoopers on July 17, the day that it
restated results for fiscal 2000 and 2001. Pricewaterhouse questioned
access to accounts and inventory valuation and recommended "the
internal control structure and monitoring process should be
strengthened to help detect misstated account balances on a timely
basis," Amerco said in a July 23 regulatory filing.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Reno-based Amerco fell as low as $10.30 in after-hours
trading. They had closed up 85 cents at $11.60 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>Shipments of compact discs dropped 7% for the first half of 2002, the
record industry's trade association said, punctuating an already
dismal year in music.</LD>
<LD>   Record industry officials blamed the decline primarily on online
piracy and CD-burning, citing a new industry-backed poll showing that
consumers who downloaded more music purchased less.</LD>
<LD>   The survey, conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates, found
that among people who said their downloading of music had increased
in the first half of the year, 41% said they bought less music now
than they did six months ago.</LD>
<TE>   The study did not include a control group to measure buying habits
of consumers who don't use the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, according to the Recording Industry Assn. of America, the
value of music shipments--product shipped from manufacturers, not
necessarily sold through to customers--dropped to $5.53 billion for
the six-month period, down from $5.93 billion a year earlier.</TE>

<LD>Volvo, the world's No. 2 maker of heavy trucks, said sales in July
rose 29%, led by demand in the U.S. in advance of new emissions
regulations and as customers sought newly released models.
Second-quarter profit fell 21% to $110 million, a smaller decline
than analysts expected, as the introduction of new truck models in
Europe and U.S. customers' purchases partly offset a widening
pension-fund deficit.</LD>

<LD>Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, said August sales
so far at stores open at least a year are near the low end of its
forecast as shoppers bought less clothing last week than expected.</LD>
<LD>   The company had projected an increase of 4% to 6% in total
same-store sales, a spokesman said. Sales at the Wal-Mart division
through Friday also are within that range, he said.</LD>
<LD>   Some shoppers may be delaying purchases as they try to stretch
their budgets amid recent declines in consumer confidence, analysts
said.</LD>
<TE>   Also, some students are waiting longer to see which styles are
popular with classmates before planning their back-to-school
wardrobe, the analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Target Corp., the second-largest U.S. discount
retailer, said sales at its stores open at least a year will rise 2%
to 4% in August.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart shares rose 21 cents to $53.40 on the New York Stock

<LD>Roche Holding, which is trying to revive demand for its Xenical
obesity pill, said the medicine may delay or prevent the development
of the most common form of diabetes.</LD>
<LD>   Patients taking Xenical who also made lifestyle changes reduced
their risk of developing diabetes by 37%, a four-year study sponsored
by Roche showed.</LD>
<LD>   Switzerland's second-biggest drug maker has changed its marketing
for the pill and now offers three months of the medicine free to U.S.
patients who purchase three months' worth. Sales of Xenical, once
billed as a potential $1-billion drug, fell 18% in the first half.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>J. Crew Group Inc. named Gap Inc.'s Ken Pilot as chief executive, the
second executive to leave the clothing retailer for a position with
J. Crew this year.</LD>
<LD>   Pilot, 41, was president of Gap's international unit, where he
oversaw 650 stores in five countries, J. Crew said. He takes over
Sept. 9 and replaces Mark Sarvary, who left J. Crew, a closely held
seller of casual clothing, in May.</LD>
<LD>   Pilot became head of overseas operations in January when San
Francisco-based Gap formed U.S. and international divisions.</LD>
<TE>   Pilot spent 13 years at Gap, which has had profit declines or
losses in the last nine quarters. Gap's same-store sales have fallen
for 27 months.</TE>

<LD>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said it won European Union approval for Xigris, the
first drug designed for a sometimes fatal overreaction to infection
known as sepsis.</LD>
<LD>   Lilly won U.S. approval of Xigris last year. First-half Xigris
sales were $44.6 million. In April, the Indianapolis-based company
cut its 2002 and 2003 profit forecasts, in part because of
disappointing sales of Xigris.</LD>

<HD>Scams Prey on Shaky Investors</HD>
<DH>Crime: Con artists pitch their schemes as safe alternatives
amid a volatile stock market, state regulators say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investment scammers are taking advantage of low interest rates and
depressed stock markets to prey on unsuspecting investors, state
regulators warned Monday.</LD>
<LD>   From unlicensed independent insurance agents to so-called prime
bank schemes, most scams involve promises of little or no risk and
high returns, North American Securities Administrators Assn.
President Joseph Borg said.</LD>
<LD>   "Con artists know investors are concerned about the volatile stock
market and low yields on bonds and bank deposits, so they pitch their
scams as safe alternatives and promise high returns--an impossible
combination," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Regulators said investors are looking for alternatives to the
stock market--which last month fell to a five-year low amid corporate
accounting scandals--and traditional money market accounts and
certificates of deposit, which are providing a low rate of return
because of the drop in interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   Topping NASAA's annual list of 10 scams in what it has called a
$40-billion scam industry are schemes by independent insurance
agents, who are promised high commissions in return for peddling the
bogus investments.</TE>
<TE>   Here are the scams, ranked by NASAA in order of prevalence or
seriousness, with examples of recent enforcement actions:</TE>
<TE>   * Insurance agents selling securities: Investors in at least 14
states lost almost $30 million in an alleged scam sold almost
entirely by independent agents, according to regulators. Money raised
from the sale of fictitious limited partnerships was used to make
payments to another group of investors.</TE>
<TE>   * Unscrupulous stockbrokers: The New York attorney general took
action against seven brokers and two firms for bilking hundreds of
elderly investors out of more than $12.5 million through a
pay-telephone scam. The brokers pressured investors into liquidating
their CDs, annuities and IRAs, promising "risk-free" 14% returns.</TE>
<TE>   * Analyst research conflicts: In May, the New York attorney
general concluded a probe into whether Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. issued
misleading research reports. Merrill agreed to pay a $100-million
fine and make significant changes in the way it does business.</TE>
<TE>   * Promissory notes: Short-term debt instruments often sold by
independent insurance agents and issued by little-known or
nonexistent companies promising high returns with little or no risk.</TE>
<TE>   * Prime bank schemes: Scammers promise investors triple-digit
returns through access to the investment portfolios of the world's
elite banks. The scam artists often target conspiracy theorists,
promising access to the "secret investments" made by the Rothschild
banking family or Saudi royalty.</TE>
<TE>   * Viatical settlements: These interests in the death benefits of
terminally ill patients are "always risky and sometimes fraudulent,"
NASAA said.</TE>
<TE>   * Affinity fraud: Schemes in which the scam artists use their
victims' religious or ethnic identity to gain their trust and then
steal their life savings.</TE>
<TE>   * Charitable gift annuities: These are transfers of cash or
property to a charitable organization. The value of the annuity is
less than the value of the cash or property, with the difference
constituting a charitable donation.</TE>
<TE>   * Oil and gas schemes: Scams that rise in frequency with
predictions of oil shortages or a rise in natural gas prices.
Arkansas regulators recently forced two firms to stop their marketing
efforts after finding that a natural gas well touted as a "can't
lose" proposition hadn't produced in years.</TE>
<TE>   * Equipment leasing: Con artists selling interest in pay phones,
cash machines or Internet kiosks have scammed thousands of investors.</TE>

<HD>Airport Screening Costs Are Up, Report Says</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Private companies are charging more since
Sept. 11, government says. Lack of oversight also cited.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Some private companies that screen airline passengers are charging
more for their services now that the government is footing the bill,
says a federal report that found one company had nearly doubled its
rates.</LD>
<LD>   The Transportation Department's inspector general also found cases
in which the companies billed the government for absent employees and
work that was never completed. And it found lax oversight by
government officials.</LD>
<LD>   Before Sept. 11, private companies had contracts with airlines to
screen passengers and their carry-on bags. After the terrorist
attacks, Congress created the Transportation Security Administration,
which was ordered to take over the contracts, worth $1.6 billion, and
to hire a federal work force to assume passenger screening duties in
more than 400 airports by Nov. 19.</LD>
<TE>   The Transportation Department said one company raised employee pay
from $10 to $14 an hour and nearly doubled overhead rates to $28 when
the government started paying the bills in February.</TE>
<TE>   The inspector general's staff visited six unidentified contractors
at two undisclosed airports and found no government supervision while
contractor employees arrived late, left early and signed in as though
they worked an entire shift.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Quinn, an attorney representing several screening
companies, said the higher costs are justified. He said security
screeners were vastly underpaid before Sept. 11 because of pressure
from the airlines to reduce costs.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn also said the government appears to be doing a good job of
supervising the companies and their screeners. "From my vantage
point, the TSA has provided fairly active oversight," said Quinn, who
cited a confidentiality agreement in declining to identify his
clients.</TE>
<TE>   The TSA did not return repeated calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The government was supposed to negotiate prices and terms with the
screening contractors after taking over the contracts six months ago,
but hasn't done so yet, the inspector general said. The TSA instead
awarded so-called letter contracts to the companies, which don't
spell out detailed terms.</TE>
<TE>   The agency is in the midst of hiring about 30,000 screeners.
Currently, screeners who work for the federal government are on the
job in 37 of the 424 airports that will have federal workers.</TE>

<HD>Applied Micro Circuits President to Retire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Applied Micro Circuits Corp., the communications-chip maker that
announced last month it would fire a quarter of its staff, said
President and Chief Operating Officer Doug Spreng will retire Sept.
30.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive and Chairman Dave Rickey will add the president's
duties, the company said in a statement without discussing who would
take the COO job. Spreng will stay on the company's board if
reelected Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Spreng, 58, plans to "pursue other interests" and spend more time
with his family, the company said. Spreng and Rickey didn't return
calls for comment.</LD>
<TE>   Applied Micro has cut costs, fired employees and trimmed pay
because of slumping sales. The company said last month it will cut
275 jobs as sales in the fiscal first quarter ended June 30 fell 27%
from a year ago. They fell 75% in the previous quarter. Customers
such as Nortel Networks Corp. trimmed orders because telephone and
Internet companies bought less equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Applied Micro shares fell 22 cents, or 4.7%, to $4.45 in Nasdaq
trading.</TE>

<HD>DoubleClick to Pay Privacy Settlement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To ward off an investigation into its privacy practices, online ad
provider DoubleClick Inc. agreed to adhere to stiff privacy
restrictions--and to pay a $450,000 settlement.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-month investigation by attorneys general from 10 states
including California examined DoubleClick's practices of gathering
Web users' personal information and surfing habits.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based company, which sells its services to
advertisers and major Internet sites, deposited unique "cookie" files
on a user's computer that tracked the machine's online travels,
allowing the company to display Web ads tailored to a person's
shopping and surfing preferences.</LD>
<TE>   Under the settlement, DoubleClick will adopt privacy-related
restrictions that include giving consumers access to their online
profiles, verifying its compliance with the agreement and paying
$450,000 for states' investigative costs and consumer education.</TE>
<TE>   Privacy advocates said the settlement pries open the murky
business of online advertising while serving as a precedent for other
advertisers who want to avoid similar investigations.</TE>
<TE>   "These rules go beyond normal U.S. Internet privacy practices into
strong privacy," said Ari Schwartz of the Center for Democracy and
Technology in Washington. "This sends a message to other companies
that are into advertising online. These are rules they'll have to
take into account."</TE>
<TE>   DoubleClick shares gained 11 cents, to $6.15, in Nasdaq trading.</TE>

<HD>Judge OKs XO Plan With Forstmann, Telmex</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal bankruptcy judge approved a restructuring plan for XO
Communications Inc. that requires an $800-million investment from two
firms that had been trying to back out of the deal.</LD>
<LD>   Investment firm Forstmann Little and the Mexican telephone company
Telmex had agreed last year to provide $400 million each to XO in a
bankruptcy reorganization in return for an 80% stake in the
reorganized company.</LD>
<LD>   But Forstmann and Telmex later said they wanted out of the deal,
believing that XO could not live up to its obligations. XO refused to
release them from the deal.</LD>
<TE>   At a hearing in New York, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Arthur J.
Gonzalez ordered the Forstmann deal to go forward.</TE>
<TE>   Forstmann Little, which had already invested $1.5 billion in XO,
controlled 34% of XO when the company filed for bankruptcy protection
in June, according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   If the Forstmann deal falls through, XO's backup plan calls for
restructuring $1 billion in loans and converting some of that debt
into equity.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Computer Sciences Corp., the third-largest U.S. computer-services
company, is cutting about 450 jobs in its group that manages
computers for banks and insurers as demand in those industries slows.</LD>
<LD>   The move will reduce the Austin, Texas-based division's staff by
about 10%, spokesman Mike Dickerson said. The company, whose
customers include J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., began cutting jobs June 1

<HD>Tenet CEO to Receive Double Pension</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The chief executive of Tenet Healthcare Corp. gets a perk that most
Americans can only dream about: retirement benefit credit for twice
the time he actually has worked for the company.</LD>
<LD>   It's a lucrative arrangement for Jeffrey C. Barbakow, who stands
to get $1.89 million in annual retirement pay from Tenet if he stays
on the job until 2004, rather than the $945,000 he would have gotten.
Barbakow started getting the two-for-one credit after he had begun to
turn the company around four years into the job, said Harry Anderson,
spokesman for Santa Barbara-based Tenet, the nation's second-largest
hospital chain.</LD>
<LD>   By earning the two-for-one credit since fiscal 1998, plus two
additional years in 2004, Barbakow gets credit for 20 years of work
for just 11 years on the job. Tenet has disclosed this arrangement
since 1998, Anderson said.</LD>
<TE>   Although exorbitant executive compensation has come under heavy
fire, particularly when it involves firms that have performed poorly
or are under investigation for alleged fraud, experts said this
package was not unusual.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not uncommon, particularly for executives who start with a
company in the middle of their careers," said Robert Felton of
McKinsey &amp; Co. in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Barbakow already has caught some fire for earning $4.5 million in
salary and bonus last year--four times more than the CEO of HCA Inc.,
the nation's largest hospital chain. Tenet's hard tactics of getting
rid of under-performing hospitals and of driving hard bargains with
health plans also have earned enemies.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts point out that Barbakow took a firm that was headed
for bankruptcy or sale in 1993 and turned it into one of the hospital
industry's standard bearers. Tenet's share price has increased by a
factor of seven and it has tripled its hospitals, from 35 to 115.</TE>
<TE>   "It might look kind of funny, but the effect is the same if they
had just paid him more for the years he worked," said Alan Garber,
director of the Stanford University Center for Health Policy. "I
don't see how we should necessarily think that Tenet is doing
something wrong here."</TE>

<HD>Bid Reported Near for TRW Auto Unit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Dow Jones Newswires</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TRW Inc. is in advanced discussions to sell its automotive-parts
business to two major private-equity firms for about $5 billion in
what would be the final transaction in its complex and lengthy
auction, said people familiar with the matter.</LD>
<LD>   The negotiations with Blackstone Group and Carlyle Group are
fluid, but a transaction could be reached as soon as this week, these
people said.</LD>
<LD>   A sale of the auto business would be a boon for Los Angeles-based
Northrop Grumman Corp., which agreed to buy TRW in July for $7.8
billion in stock. Northrop had said it would divest itself of the
auto business, TRW's largest unit, immediately after completing the
acquisition.</LD>
<TE>   Although its bid was for all of TRW, Northrop was interested only
in TRW's space and military assets. Before it reached the deal with
Northrop, TRW also agreed to sell its aeronautics business to
Goodrich Corp. for $1.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for Blackstone and Carlyle declined to comment on the
situation, reported in the Financial Times newspaper. Spokesmen for
TRW and Northrop also declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds of both sales could be used to significantly pare TRW's
more than $5 billion in debt, associated mainly with the auto
operation. The unit, which makes air bags and brake equipment, has
suffered in recent years due to increased competition and a lagging
economy in the U.S.</TE>

<HD>United to Reveal Cost-Cutting Plans</HD>
<DH>Airlines: The carrier, trying to avoid a bankruptcy filing,
seeks concessions from unions and vendors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>United Airlines Chief Executive Jack Creighton told employees that
unions of the nation's No. 2 carrier will be informed by the end of
this week about cutbacks it's recommending to avoid a bankruptcy
filing.</LD>
<LD>   The proposals, expected to include substantial pay cuts and other
concessions, are part of a recovery plan that struggling United is
overhauling in hopes of getting a $1.8-billion federal loan guarantee
and ensuring an end to its long financial slide.</LD>
<LD>   "By cutting our costs, we can get ourselves back on track,"
Creighton said in his weekly taped message to employees.</LD>
<TE>   UAL Corp.'s United announced Aug. 14 that it might have to file
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this fall if it didn't reach
major cost-saving agreements within 30 days with its employees,
vendors and lessors.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of meetings with union officials since then, Creighton
said United has been "opening the airline's books so the unions'
financial experts can confirm the serious nature of our economic
predicament."</TE>
<TE>   Once the airline's recommendations for each union are shared later
this week, he said, United will pursue an amended application for the
loan guarantee that it intends to file by Sept.16 with the Air
Transportation Stabilization Board.</TE>
<TE>   Creighton told employees the airline is pursuing both labor and
non-labor cost savings and is looking to raise revenue by adding
flights to certain profitable routes.</TE>
<TE>   United's pilots, who own about 28% of the company, had been
scheduled to vote starting last week on a proposed 10% pay cut.</TE>
<TE>   But that vote was postponed indefinitely in light of the carrier's
push for even bigger cutbacks and cost savings.</TE>
<TE>   The machinists' union has not been informed of United's specific
proposals, spokesman Joe Tiberi said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the third big union, representing flight attendants,
are scheduled to meet with United executives today.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of UAL rose 39 cents to $4.12 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Warner Center Business Park to Be Sold</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kearney Real Estate Co. and financial partner Morgan Stanley will buy
Warner Center Business Park in Woodland Hills for about $55 million,
according to real estate investment professionals tracking the
transaction.</LD>
<LD>   Executives at Century City-based Kearny acknowledged that they
have signed an agreement to acquire about 15 low-rise office
buildings in the heart of the Warner Center commercial district.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the institutional owners that are selling the complex
to Kearny are scheduled to close escrow in September on the sale of
the adjacent Warner Center Plaza high-rise office complex.</LD>
<TE>   An institutional fund managed by Santa Monica's Douglas Emmett
Realty Advisors is buying five glass towers on Oxnard Street for an
estimated price of nearly $340 million.</TE>
<TE>   Kearny Real Estate usually invests in partnership with Morgan
Stanley Real Estate Funds, which holds a 50% interest in the company.
Senior executives such as Jeff Dritley, Kearny's managing partner,
own the other half.</TE>
<TE>   Dritley confirmed that Kearny has agreed to buy Warner Center
Business Park, with the transaction scheduled to close this year. He
wouldn't disclose the price his firm is paying or its plans for the
complex.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the sellers, the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp.
and Harvard University's endowment fund, declined to discuss either
sale.</TE>
<TE>   Their partnership, known as AH Warner Center, has owned the Warner
Center Properties portfolio since the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   AH Warner hired Los Angeles real estate investment banking firm
Secured Capital Corp. last year to find one or more buyers for the
2.3-million-square-foot portfolio of commercial buildings at the core
of the western San Fernando Valley's commercial hub.</TE>
<TE>   Early this year, Douglas Emmett executives began negotiating
exclusively for the high-rises with executives of Secured Capital and
AEW Capital Management, AH Warner Center's asset manager for the
portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   The $55-million price reported by market observers for the
low-rise buildings was less than previous estimates of the
properties' worth. That cost appears to reflect continued economic
uncertainty as well as the complex's vacancy rate, which recently
surpassed 25%, according to Warner Center Properties' Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Although asking rents for West Valley office space have remained
stable over the last year, overall vacancies, including space for
sublease, have topped 15%, from 11.3% a year ago, according to
brokerage Colliers Seeley.</TE>
<TE>   Office buildings under construction probably will lead to slightly
higher vacancies in the months ahead, putting pressure on rents at
least until next year, the firm said.</TE>
<TE>   The Kearny group, whose origins stem from Morgan Stanley's big
real estate funds formed in the early and mid-1990s, has been an
active player in Southland commercial real estate for many years.</TE>
<TE>   The firm has improved the performance of other West Valley
commercial properties, including Warnerview Corporate Center and
Calabasas Courtyard.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom Exec Told to Drop His Questions</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Controller chided a vice president for raising
accounting issues, e-mail shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc. Controller David Myers tried to muzzle a fellow
executive who raised questions about the company's books with outside
accounting firm Arthur Andersen, according to documents released
Monday by a House subcommittee.</LD>
<LD>   Myers sent a threatening e-mail to Steven Brabbs, WorldCom's vice
president for international controls in London, after
Brabbs--allegedly without authorization--approached Arthur Andersen
about the way in which millions of dollars in WorldCom expenses were
accounted for.</LD>
<LD>   "Do not have any more meetings" with Arthur Andersen, Myers wrote
in a Jan. 22 e-mail to Brabbs. "I spoke to AA this morning and hear
that you are still talking about asset impairments and facilities. I
do not want to hear an excuse. Just stop. Don't make me ask you
again," Myers wrote.</LD>
<TE>   The e-mail was part of a series of WorldCom documents released by
the House Financial Services Committee's investigation subcommittee,
which has been probing questionable accounting practices that helped
drive the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier to file for
bankruptcy protection last month.</TE>
<TE>   The committee is focusing on whether some WorldCom officials hid
$7.18 billion in company expenses over the last several years to help
the Clinton, Miss.-based company post profit instead of losses.</TE>
<TE>   Myers and former WorldCom Chief Financial Officer Scott D.
Sullivan were arrested Aug. 1 on federal charges that they conspired
with "others known and unknown" to conceal WorldCom losses in part by
wrongly listing company operating expenses as capital expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the two men said their clients, who are free on bail
but scheduled to be in court Sept. 3 when prosecutors must return an
indictment, would plead not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   But legal experts said Monday that the e-mail could further
complicate matters for Myers.</TE>
<TE>   "Statements such as [his e-mail] generally have a degree of
relevance because at the minimum they impact the credibility of the
individual, and at the other end of the spectrum are outright
relevant to his" culpability, said Richard Hibey, a Washington
criminal defense lawyer who has represented former Philippines
President Ferdinand E. Marcos and former deputy CIA operations
director Clair George.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it is unclear whether the e-mail exchanges between Myers
and Brabbs are as legally damning as they are terse. Just minutes
before Myers' e-mail demand that Brabbs not talk to Arthur Andersen,
Brabbs offered to call Myers and explain "what is really happening."</TE>
<TE>   The exchange has left committee investigators unable to determine
whether Myers' complaints were triggered by genuine differences over
complex accounting rules that went into effect weeks before his
e-mail was sent to Brabbs, or whether Myers was seeking to prevent
Brabbs from disclosing the questionable expense shifting that is at
the heart of the WorldCom financial scandal.</TE>
<TE>   The documents released by the committee also include an e-mail to
Brabbs from Tilesh Patel of WorldCom's British office that indicates
that WorldCom had to review Arthur Andersen's determinations about
WorldCom's treatment of write-downs before restating any costs.</TE>
<TE>   In his e-mail, Patel said there were differences of "opinion"
concerning the writing down of assets, and a review of Andersen's
proposals couldn't be completed "within the next few days."</TE>
<TE>   There is no indication from the documents about how the matter was
ultimately resolved.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not found any specific action taken against Steven
Brabbs" for going to Arthur Andersen, said Peggy Peterson, a
spokeswoman for House Financial Services Committee Chairman Michael
G. Oxley (R-Ohio).</TE>
<TE>   But "the e-mails show the opposition and the intimidation that
Brabbs encountered when he raised questions," Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   Brabbs couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom spokeswoman Julie Moore said her company was "continuing
to cooperate with all investigative bodies and will continue to do so
until there is a full resolution."</TE>
<TE>   The January incident is the second reported clash between Myers
and Brabbs over WorldCom's bookkeeping.</TE>
<TE>   In April 2000, Myers also chided Brabbs after the executive raised
questions about WorldCom classifying more than $33 million in
operating costs as capital costs.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails "give you an inside view of the internal workings at
WorldCom, which look to be pretty tough," Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   The committee requested the e-mails as part of its ongoing
investigation of WorldCom, which besides operating long-distance
giant MCI owns communications wires that carry about half of all
Internet traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department, the New York attorney general's office and
the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has charged WorldCom
with fraud, also are scrutinizing the company and its executives.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom filed for the biggest bankruptcy in history in July,
about a month after the company acknowledged it had hidden $3.9
billion of its expenses.</TE>
<TE>   This month, the company found an additional $3.3 billion in
overstated earnings, bringing the total to $7.18 billion.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, once one of the fastest-growing telecommunications
companies in the world with operations in 65 countries, now says it
lost money in 2000 and 2001.</TE>

<HD>Vanguard Group Seeks OK for Index Switch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the latest chapter in Vanguard Group's dispute with Standard &amp;
Poor's, the mutual fund giant said Monday that it will seek
shareholder approval to switch benchmarks for eight of its
index-tracking stock mutual funds.</LD>
<LD>   The move may pave the way for Valley Forge, Pa.-based Vanguard to
expand it lineup of so-called exchange-traded funds, or ETFs,
analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   S&amp;P, a division of McGraw-Hill Cos., prevailed last year in a
lawsuit preventing Vanguard from issuing ETFs based on the S&amp;P 500
and the "growth" and "value" subsets of the blue-chip index.</LD>
<TE>   ETFs are baskets of stocks or bonds, like mutual funds, but are
priced throughout the day like regular stocks. They have become
highly popular over the last two years, especially with traders.</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard said the index switch, if approved by shareholders, would
not apply to its well-known 500 Index fund, which tracks the S&amp;P 500,
but would involve these index funds: Total Stock Market; Extended
Market; Growth and Value (both of which are large-cap funds);
Mid-Cap; Small-Cap, Small-Cap Growth and Small-Cap Value.</TE>
<TE>   Gus Sauter, who oversees Vanguard's $200 billion in equity index
fund assets, indicated that Vanguard is less than thrilled with the
indexes it now is using as benchmarks.</TE>
<TE>   "Over time, we've developed our own views with respect to best
practices in index construction and rebalancing methodology," he
said. "Index providers have been exploring many of these same ideas
and we are beginning to see opportunities open up that we believe may
be worth pursuing."</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard said it has secured the right to use new indexes under
development by Morgan Stanley Capital International, though it
wouldn't be obligated to use them. In the cases of the funds it
named, Vanguard would be replacing five S&amp;P indexes, two indexes
maintained by Wilshire Associates and one from Frank Russell Co.</TE>
<TE>   A switch to new indexes could occur in 2003, Vanguard said.</TE>
<TE>   Though Vanguard has issued ETFs mimicking its Total Stock Market
and Extended Market funds, analysts speculated that a deal with MSCI
could allow the fund company to greatly expand its ETF lineup as
early as next year.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question this is a market-driven strategy," said
Daniel Wiener, editor of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard
Investors newsletter in Potomac, Md. "They want to offer ETFs, and
what [Vanguard Chairman] Jack Brennan is saying to S&amp;P is, 'I'm
taking my ball and playing somewhere else.' "</TE>
<TE>   For the open-end mutual funds involved, switching indexes could
prompt portfolio turnover. But Wiener said the changes probably would
not trigger capital gains distributions, because of offsetting losses
the funds have on the books from the long bear market.</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard to Refocus Utility Stock Fund</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard is pulling the plug on its utility-stock fund.</TE>
<TE>   The firm said Monday that it wants to transform the Vanguard
Utilities Income Fund, with $656 million in assets, into the Vanguard
Dividend Growth Fund, to give its portfolio managers a wider swath of
dividend-paying shares from which to choose.</TE>
<TE>   Utilities, including electric companies and telecom firms, once
appealed to conservative investors in search of above-average
dividends.</TE>
<TE>   But deregulation of the electric and telecom industries in the
1990s injected instability, and higher risk, into many of the stocks.
Many electric and telecom companies in recent years de-emphasized
dividend payments and pitched themselves as growth firms.</TE>
<TE>   "Growing up, parents talked about buying utility stocks to get
stability and rich dividends, but today it's a different industry,"
said Brian Mattes, a Vanguard spokesman. "If you had bought the fund
for that reason, you're not quite getting what you wanted."</TE>
<TE>   As the Dividend Growth Fund, the portfolio would seek out
high-dividend stocks across all industries, Vanguard said.</TE>
<TE>   Changing the fund's focus will require the approval of
shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>

<HD>Ribapharm Sues Roche to Block Its Hepatitis Treatment</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: The rival drugs would compete with
ribavirin, the Costa Mesa company's only product.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ribapharm Inc. on Monday filed a lawsuit to prevent Swiss
pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding from selling a hepatitis treatment
in the United States that would compete with ribavirin, the Costa
Mesa company's only product.</LD>
<LD>   Ribapharm, which is majority owned by ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
filed similar suits earlier this month against Roche in the
Netherlands and Germany.</LD>
<LD>   In its suit filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Ribapharm
says it intends to enforce its U.S. patents on ribavirin.</LD>
<TE>   Ribapharm licenses ribavirin to Schering-Plough Corp., which sells
the drug as Rebetol in combination with its Peg-Intron treatment for
hepatitis C.</TE>
<TE>   Roche is seeking U.S. approval for a rival therapy combining its
hepatitis drugs Pegasys and Copegus, a form of ribavirin.</TE>
<TE>   It expects to introduce those products in the U.S. by the end of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   "We are confident no valid patents exist that will block Roche
from marketing its own ribavirin in the U.S.," said Roche spokeswoman
Pamela Van Houten.</TE>
<TE>   Ribapharm relies heavily on royalties from ribavirin. Industry
analysts have predicted that Schering-Plough will pay Ribapharm
royalties of as much as $250 million this year and as much as $290
million in 2003 on ribavirin sales, compared with 2001 royalties of
$143 million.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, Ribapharm shares fell 5 cents to
$5.80. Shares of Kenilworth, N.J.-based Schering-Plough fell 85 cents
to $23.50, also on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>The Vietnam Folly Calls Out to Us as War Fever Burns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY I. KUTLER</AU>
<BD>Stanley I. Kutler is the author of "The Wars of
Watergate" (W.W. Norton, 1992).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than 30 years, we have debated the meaning, lessons and
significance of the Vietnam War. The chords of memory still resonate:
the arrogance of power; the world's policeman; the dangers of
nation-building.</LD>
<LD>   Can those lessons help in understanding our current situation? Or
will they be relegated to an ash can of history by a Bush
administration bent on erasing such issues from public consciousness
or awareness?</LD>
<LD>   Tom DeLay, the president's leader in the House of Representatives,
recently remarked that if George W. Bush had been president in the
1960s, we would have won in Vietnam. Learn nothing; forget
everything.</LD>
<TE>   The lessons of the past are problematic, sometimes distorted for
partisan gain, but they can provide sober enlightenment. They will
not go away, however the president might wish. He should remember the
Vietnam War's painful, clear lessons on the limits of our power,
limits to our ability to impose our will on others, and the hazards
of unilateralism and lack of support in the international community.
He should remember his father's determination to build a grand
coalition for the Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   Bush II is considering the necessity of an invasion of Iraq and
the toppling of its regime. Where is the debate? Absent any real
dissent, we have a lethal combination of inertia, intimidation and
political impotence, all combining to cast an illusion of
overwhelming consensus.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), the chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, has embraced that consensus with his
customary fervor. Biden apparently believes that he fulfills the
constitutional function of advise and consent by merely being the
cheerleader for the administration's rising chorus demanding war with
Iraq. When and how are the only questions in his repertoire.</TE>
<TE>   In this march toward war, Bush is antagonizing potential allies
such as Iran. The Bushes have a problem--or a grudge--with Iraq, to
be sure, but why publicly humiliate and then outrage the other
sometime-antagonists when all the available evidence indicates that
they have been moving toward a rapprochement with the rest of the
world, including the United States? Or does the president curiously
interpret his election as a mandate to repudiate all of Bill
Clinton's initiatives, such as the progress made in the last year of
Clinton's administration in reducing differences and tensions between
Washington and Tehran?</TE>
<TE>   Some months ago, President Bush, for yet unfathomable reasons,
lumped Iran with Iraq and North Korea as an axis of evil. Since Sept.
11, the administration has feasted on World War II analogies and
metaphors to advance its causes. But analogies have built-in
limitations. Iraq, Iran and North Korea are not Nazi Germany or
Imperial Japan--not even close. Two of the countries barely can feed
themselves; the third is racked by intense internal turmoil.</TE>
<TE>   Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's government recently delivered
16 Al Qaeda suspects to the Saudi government. In remarks in Kabul,
Afghanistan's capital, Khatami hinted at Iran's still- secret role in
ending Taliban rule. Finally, he specifically pointed to the Clinton
administration's negotiations and efforts to reduce tensions between
the U.S. and Iran and resume normal relations--a far cry from the
White House dubbing the Iranians as members of an axis of evil. Why
would the Bush administration cavalierly undercut Khatami, who, with
a large part of his nation, has struggled to end the unbridled power
of the mullahs?</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was indifferent to Khatami's
visit to Kabul and Iran's concern for its borderlands. Moreover, he
contemptuously and flippantly dismissed the Iranian transfer of Al
Qaeda suspects, saying "they, for whatever reason, have turned over
some people to other countries. But they've not turned any to us."</TE>
<TE>   The president's "wanted dead or alive" dictum simply does not have
the carpet of jurisdiction he and Rumsfeld would like, but Bush might
remember that Iran's enmity toward Iraq long antedates and outweighs
ours. We could use this to our advantage.</TE>
<TE>   The history lessons from Vietnam and other successes and failures
in foreign policy are relevant to the moment. Where is the debate?</TE>
<TE>   History is worth remembering; after all, it is our ideas and
memories that we are supposed to be defending.</TE>

<HD>Government Aid to Airlines Is Just Excess Baggage for
Taxpayers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEVERIN BORENSTEIN</AU>
<BD>Severin Borenstein, a professor at UC Berkeley's Haas
School of Business, has advised airlines and governments on aviation
policy for more than 20 years.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some commentators are arguing that the airline industry is uniquely
incapable of operating profitably and therefore needs government
assistance. Yet losses and shakeouts happen periodically in nearly
all capital-intensive industries. More subsidies would just divert
federal revenue without helping passengers.</LD>
<LD>   In the early 1990s, memory chips were expensive, and chip
producers were getting rich. Consequently, many chip makers built new
billion-dollar production facilities.</LD>
<LD>   When the expected growth in demand didn't materialize, producers
suffered immense losses, and many entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Yet
you could still buy memory chips for your PC. Given the firms'
capital investments, the companies were worth more operating than
shut down.</LD>
<TE>   Fast-forward five or six years to the U.S. airline industry: Big
profits in the mid-to late-1990s led to huge new investments in
capital (airplanes and ground facilities), which were followed by a
decline in demand (even before, but accelerated by, Sept. 11) that
trashed the value of their capital investments.</TE>
<TE>   Companies found themselves on the financial ropes. US Airways is
in bankruptcy, United is teetering and others aren't far behind.</TE>
<TE>   Just as with the chip industry, nearly all these companies are
still worth more alive than dead.</TE>
<TE>   Some will have to reorganize under bankruptcy, which is a nice way
of saying that shareholders will lose everything and creditors will
not get paid all they are owed. One or two airlines may even close
their doors, though many airlines have entered Chapter 11 and emerged
a year or two later without ever missing a day of operations.
Continental has done it twice.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the U.S. airline industry is not going to shut down.
Fewer flights will--and should--operate because demand has declined,
but more people are flying now than in any year before 1999, so
service cutbacks won't be large. If some carriers close down, others
will move into their profitable routes.</TE>
<TE>   Last September, the industry wrangled a $5-billion cash subsidy
from the federal government, arguing that air travel is a backbone of
the economy. Indeed it is, but profitable flights would have
continued with or without the bailout, whether or not carriers had to
file Chapter 11.</TE>
<TE>   The subsidy was essentially a $5-billion gift from taxpayers to
airline shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   The money wasn't for workers or anyone near the Sept. 11 disaster
sites. And of all the people affected by Sept. 11, airline
shareholders don't seem to be among the most deserving of government
aid. Investors can reduce risk by diversifying their portfolios.
Workers, however, can't diversify their employment.</TE>
<TE>   And airline workers, particularly pilots and mechanics, will be
big losers. Since deregulation, they have become virtual (or actual)
co-owners of the companies, and their compensation has followed
industry profits. (Not the flight attendants, though, because they
have so little bargaining power that they earn McDonald's-level wages
in good times and bad.)</TE>
<TE>   A somewhat smaller industry also means some layoffs. But the
industry isn't going to shrink massively.</TE>
<TE>   Employment will shift among carriers. Layoffs by the
least-efficient carriers--read US Airways--make front-page news. But
hiring by the most efficient--read Southwest--goes unreported.</TE>
<TE>   For travelers, the industry turmoil means downward price pressure
because of excess capacity. Just as the plethora of unused fiber
optic lines has led to 4-cent-per-minute long-distance rates, those
surplus aircraft parked in the Mojave Desert mean discounts for air
travelers.</TE>
<TE>   The news for consumers isn't all good, though.</TE>
<TE>   Airlines are now more likely to give up on thinner routes that
they were hoping would turn profitable. You'll still be able to get
from X to Y, but it may not be as convenient.</TE>
<TE>   And, finally, the question on every traveler's mind: Yes, your
frequent-flier miles are safe. Carriers in bankruptcy continue to
honor them, and if they get bought by bigger airlines, the miles can
become more valuable. Ask anyone who had TWA miles before it was
folded into American.</TE>
<TE>   So unless you're an airline pilot, mechanic or shareholder, cheer
up. This isn't the prettiest part of capitalism, but the industry is
going to get through this fine, and there are going to be some great
fares along the way.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if you are a taxpayer, you might wonder why we had to
pay $5 billion to get to this point.</TE>

<HD>A Mutual Problem for Investors</HD>
<DH>The next fiscal shoe to drop may be fund managers'
conflicts of interest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNA HUFFINGTON</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington writes a syndicated column. E-mail:
arianna@ariannaonline.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the wildfire of corporate scandals rages around us, it's clear
it's being fueled by the dry rot of conflicts of interest:
accountants double-dipping as consultants, Wall Street analysts
acting as investment bankers, politicians turning a blind eye to the
dirty deeds of their campaign donors.</LD>
<LD>   Yet there is another, even more combustible conflict of interest
that has yet to hit the headlines. The two-faced status of mutual
funds managers.</LD>
<LD>   Mutual funds are now among the largest owners of American
corporations--controlling close to $3 trillion in stock. The 75
largest mutual fund companies control 44% of the voting power at U.S.
companies. So there are enormous consequences for all of us when the
owners elect not to act like owners but like timorous lackeys
desperate to please management.</LD>
<TE>   But that's exactly what's happening because of a gargantuan
conflict of interest: The giant mutual funds are serving two masters.
As owners of huge amounts of stock, it is their job to hold
management accountable. But there are massive fees coming their way
when corporate executives award them 401(k) and pension fund assets
to invest.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the nation's largest mutual fund, Fidelity, which
owns 5.3% of Tyco's stock, also earned $2 million in 1999 for its
part in running Tyco's 401(k) plans. Last year, more than 50% of
Fidelity's $9.8 billion in revenue was generated by administering
401(k) plans and other employee benefit services for about 11,000
companies, including Philip Morris, Shell, IBM, Monsanto and Ford.</TE>
<TE>   Those running the mutual funds know that if they rock the boat
they jeopardize their chances of getting the contracts for these
services. So, with ownership essentially AWOL, irresponsible
corporate execs have been allowed to run wild. Not surprisingly,
mutual funds have consistently refused to disclose how they vote. As
California Treasurer Phil Angelides told me, "That silence speaks
volumes."</TE>
<TE>   With their financial clout, if mutual funds demanded change, they
would not--could not--be ignored. In fact, they could have insisted
on and gotten all the rules and standards the new corporate reform
law imposes. And much, much more.</TE>
<TE>   And it's not as if there are no role models. Take the example of
Bill Gross, founder and managing director of Pacific Investment
Management Co., or Pimco, which manages more than $250 billion in
bond funds. This spring, after Gross took General Electric to the
woodshed for misleading investors about the company's debt, he
unloaded most of Pimco's $1 billion in GE bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "I picked on GE," Gross told me, "because I wanted to alert the
investment universe that it wasn't just Enron, Tyco or WorldCom
pulling some fast ones, but GE--the biggest guy on the block--and
probably everyone in between. GE definitely changed things in the
last six months, and I sort of think I nudged them along the way."</TE>
<TE>   He didn't just nudge it. He wounded it enough to force it to clean
up its balance sheet. Gross' speaking out was as remarkable for its
effectiveness as it was for its rarity.</TE>
<TE>   To see how an investment fund that doesn't have its hands tied by
conflicts of interest might operate, take a look at the nation's
largest pension fund, the California Public Employees' Retirement
System, or CalPERS, which gets its money directly from the state of
California. CalPERS has announced that it will not do business with
any bank that breaches the wall between research and banking, and it
is considering Angelides' proposal that it divest any company that
has moved offshore to avoid paying taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The debate over the last few months has focused on accounting
firms mixing auditing with consulting and investment banks not
keeping research independent of banking.</TE>
<TE>   It is now time to hold mutual funds accountable: Isn't their
fiduciary obligation to their investors paramount? Or are they using
the money of working Americans as a come-on to generate more
servicing fees?</TE>

<HD>Business Is Safe but Baseball Strikes Out</HD>
<DH>Bush isn't upset about Enron but flips his lid at the idea
of a players walkout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD>Robert Scheer writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everyone, from President Bush on down, seems to agree that major
league baseball players are overpaid prima donnas who don't deserve
the huge paychecks they get, let alone have a right to strike and
mess up the season.</LD>
<LD>   This derision aimed at the players is a strange compliment of
sorts, for in a corrupt business world they are apparently the only
participants expected to refrain from milking the system for all it's
worth. Why is it only the greed of athletes that is shocking, when we
have so much recent evidence that not only greed but actual crime is
typical at the corporate heights?</LD>
<LD>   Isn't it odd that Bush's statement that he would be "furious" at a
baseball strike is far more passionate a response than his smug
nonchalance over Enron and other corporations profiteering during the
California energy crisis last year? Of course, cynical market
manipulations such as Enron's infamous "Death Star" tactic were only
threatening the nation's biggest, most economically important state,
not the pennant race.</LD>
<TE>   Even last week's guilty plea by Michael J. Kopper, a top Enron
manager who is criminally implicating the company's highest
officials, didn't elicit any presidential passion.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Bush is a bit more sanguine about greed as expressed in
the halls of one of his biggest campaign contributors? Or does he
still think his old buddy "Kenny Boy" Lay was blissfully unaware of
these corrupt practices?</TE>
<TE>   But egregious examples of gouging by those with the power to
leverage stock options, loans, kickback schemes and insider trading
deals are all too common, even in the business of sports. Take big
league baseball's squalid gang of billionaire owners, who maximize
profit by holding up taxpayers for new ballparks by threatening to
take their ball and go somewhere else and by taking advantage of
enormous tax breaks.</TE>
<TE>   That's what George W. did with the Texas Rangers when he parlayed
$606,000--nearly all borrowed from a Midland, Texas, bank where he
had been a director--into a $15-million profit when he sold his stake
in the team a decade later. The Rangers, despite erratic results on
the field, grew astronomically in financial value because Arlington,
Texas, taxpayers faced with the threat of losing the Rangers were
coerced into coming up with $135 million in sales taxes to build
Bush's team a palatial new field of dreams. Bush and his buddies also
used their political influence to grab valuable commercial land
surrounding the stadium under the government power of eminent domain.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to those acquisitions, paid for with more than $200 million
in public funds, Bush and his partners were able to turn around and
sell for $240 million a team they had purchased for $86 million. Bush
never did risk any of his own money, instead selling shares at an
inflated insider's rate--courtesy of his now-famous relationship with
Harken Energy--to cover the original bank loan.</TE>
<TE>   Quite a hustle, huh? And those millions rolled in without the
endless practice sessions and nerve-tingling performances required of
professional athletes on a daily basis. Of course, to earn his piece
of the pie, George W. had to show up regularly on the golf links
where the deals were made.</TE>
<TE>   For Bush, there never was any real risk of failure, and he
certainly never had to spend years bumping around back roads eating
soggy fries as an itinerant minor league hopeful.</TE>
<TE>   As has been pointed out many times during his spotty business
career, Bush was born on third base and is convinced he hit a triple.
For a kid trying to take the long, hardball road to fame and fortune,
failure usually means going home to a small town with no education
and few job prospects.</TE>
<TE>   And for those who make it, like all-star shortstop Miguel Tejada,
who worked his way to the pinnacle of his sport despite a childhood
spent as a homeless street urchin in the Dominican Republic, the
rewards are, yes, enormous. Not many successful MBAs, the president
included, can claim such real-life Horatio Alger stories.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, should the players dare to strike, they will be hit
over the head with the club of patriotism, charged with betraying
national unity on the eve of the Sept. 11 anniversary. It's
hypocritical gibberish. After all, who has hurt the nation more in
the last year, the company that once paid to have its name on the
Ballpark Formerly Known as Enron or the world-class athletes who
grace the playing field?</TE>

<LD>The Keystone Kops must be advising the city of Burbank on airport
security. That's the only explanation for the farce that played out
Friday, when Burbank building and safety officials ordered the
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport to halt security renovations. This
happened on the very morning a judge went against a voter-passed
initiative and said such renovations were legal.</LD>
<LD>   City officials said they rushed to stop the renovation work
because the airport lacked a building permit. "It's a health and
safety issue," said Burbank's city attorney.</LD>
<LD>   It surely is a safety issue. Airports across the country are
striving to upgrade security after 9/11, though Burbank officials
seem unaware of that. The airport's governing board--the Burbank,
Glendale and Pasadena city councils each appoint three
members--rightly wants to add 40,000 square feet to the cramped,
173,000-square-foot terminal building to accommodate additional
security checkpoints and huge machines to scan checked baggage.</LD>
<TE>   But Burbank refused to grant a building permit until after
Friday's court date. So the airport board ordered demolition to begin
without a permit, saying to delay would keep the airport from meeting
a federally mandated deadline.</TE>
<TE>   The city accused the airport of rushing construction to force a
crisis that would usurp the city's hard-won control over airport land
use. The airport accused the city of stalling. In other words, it was
just another installment in the decades-long battle over expanding
the airport, as though 9/11 never happened.</TE>
<TE>   Airport officials have been trying to build a new terminal since
1980 to replace the one built more than 70 years ago for biplanes.
Prodded by voters irate over airport noise, Burbank city leaders
fought each effort to a standstill until about three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides agreed to a compromise that would have limited the
size of a new terminal. After the plan fell apart, die-hard airport
critics launched the initiative drive to stop any future accords. But
surely even they never intended to block security improvements.</TE>
<TE>   This is not about fighting airport expansion; it's about fighting
terrorism. Burbank city and airport officials need to be working
together to protect the airport and its passengers. It's time to send
the Keystone Kops packing and get serious about security.</TE>

<LD>With Vice President Dick Cheney's forceful address to the Veterans of
Foreign Wars on Monday, the Bush administration is pumping up its
talk of war against Iraq. In making a major speech rather than simply
responding to questions and answers, Cheney offered the first
comprehensive case for war that any senior official has offered.</LD>
<LD>   But if the administration believes that it can take such a fateful
step without asking Congress for authorization, as several anonymous
senior officials have recently indicated, it should think again. When
it comes to launching a major war and the uncertainties that entails,
a public debate and a Capitol Hill resolution are not frivolous
luxuries but the essence of American democracy.</LD>
<LD>   It now appears that White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales is close
to concluding that the president need not receive formal approval
from Congress. The idea is that 1991's Persian Gulf War congressional
resolution authorizing military action is still operative. That
resolution was tied to conditions set forth in the United Nations
Security Council resolution demanding that Iraq allow weapons
inspections; Iraq has refused to comply fully.</LD>
<TE>   These arguments may be legalistically correct, but they aren't
politically astute. Many presidents, beginning with John Adams and
the undeclared "quasi-war" against the French, have tussled with
Congress over matters of war and peace. The 1973 War Powers Act
specifies that the president can use military force for 60 to 90
days, after which Congress is supposed to weigh in on any further
actions.</TE>
<TE>   The act is unwieldy, but the reason it was created should serve as
a lesson for the administration. Congress was determined to ensure
that the United States would never slide into another Vietnam. Future
presidents were supposed to earn public assent before entering into
combat.</TE>
<TE>   The first President Bush did that in January 1991 before the Gulf
War, even though he claimed that he wasn't dependent on congressional
approval. The current President Bush should heed his father's example
by getting Congress on record and explaining to the public the
reasons for war. Of course, Congress might not be persuaded, and
evidently that is what the administration fears.</TE>
<TE>   As the Bush administration carries out the shadowy war against
terrorism, it must maintain a delicate balance in the volatile Middle
East region. It cannot coddle extremists, nor can it alienate
moderates. But a full-scale assault aimed at toppling Saddam
Hussein--and even if the United States could do so, it could not
dictate who or what might follow--still reeks of a plan designed to
prove the administration's potency.</TE>
<TE>   As the prolonged struggle in Afghanistan suggests, the likelihood
is that the United States, which has yet to produce credible Iraqi
opposition leaders, would be stuck in Iraq for years, even if Hussein
were successfully overthrown. An operation of this magnitude should
not be carried out by a president without assent from Congress.</TE>

<LD>The summit that opened in Johannesburg on Monday is supposed to deal
with a staggering list of problems, from poverty to overfishing, from
unclean drinking water to climate change. Some of the 100 presidents
and prime ministers due to attend the gathering in South Africa have
made matters worse, siphoning off money that could have lessened
poverty and drilled wells for fresh water. Some will demand yet more
aid from richer nations, primarily the United States. It's easy to be
cynical about so large a meeting confronting so vast a panoply of
problems, but refocusing world attention on the environment can be a
start toward improving the quality of the air, water and land.</LD>
<LD>   It will be difficult to overcome divisions among the countries at
what is officially known as the World Summit on Sustainable
Development. European countries say the main focus of the 10-day
gathering, organized by the United Nations, should be water and
renewable energy. But poorer countries want to concentrate on getting
more aid from wealthier nations. The United States, which is not
sending its leader, wants to emphasize the need for developing
nations to reduce corruption and account for the aid they now
receive.</LD>
<TE>   An encouraging aspect of the summit is the presence of businesses
and organizations specializing in helping villages drill wells, build
health clinics and educate children. The need for partnership is
clear. Governments can provide expertise and money to help
organizations do the work on the ground. Businesses can provide
technology to make well-drilling easier and schools more
energy-efficient.</TE>
<TE>   Up to 40,000 people are expected at the summit. President Bush's
refusal to attend sends a signal that the world's most powerful
country, also the biggest economic force and biggest polluter, is not
as concerned as it should be with the environment. Bush's absence
also fits the administration's pattern of rejecting global
accords--such as the Kyoto Protocol, which grew out of the 1992 Earth
Summit in Rio de Janeiro--and preferring to go it alone. Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell will attend the conference in its final days.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration did join European nations at a summit in
Monterrey, Mexico, this year in promising to increase foreign aid by
$12 billion a year. That is an important step, since the poverty of
developing nations contributes greatly to pollution. Coal and wood
fires emit smoke that hangs over cities like New Delhi and Jakarta,
where many residents are too poor to afford electricity. A pre-summit
U.N. report said 3 million people died each year because of air
pollution.</TE>
<TE>   The absence of U.S. leadership may make it more difficult to solve
environmental problems, but it need not be impossible. When Powell
arrives at the summit, he should assure world leaders that the United
States' recent financial pledge in Monterrey is demonstration that
this nation understands its large role in addressing world pollution.</TE>

<LD>Re "Lukewarm Backing for Simon," Aug. 24: The biggest beneficiary of
President Bush's fund-raising for the California governorship was not
Republican candidate Bill Simon, it was Gov. Gray Davis. All Davis'
negative campaign ads against Simon were nothing compared with the
bonanza he reaped from the intense adverse media coverage Simon
received as a result of Bush's visit.</LD>
<LD>   While many voters might not put much stock in attacks included in
campaign ads, considering their source, they do take heed when the
same attacks begin every newscast and are on the front page. What it
shows is that Simon not only has difficulty running businesses, he
can't even run a campaign.</LD>
<LD>   Jack Allen</LD>
<TE>   Pacific Palisades</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's the economy, stupid. This is true now, in the governor's
race, more than ever. Davis inherited a budget surplus and turned it
into a multibillion-dollar deficit. He has increased state spending,
offering raises to his union buddies when everyone else is losing his
job.</TE>
<TE>   What concerns me more than anything is the press' reporting of our
situation. It is so desperate to invent scandalous stories about
Bush's support for Simon that it is losing sight of the bottom line.
I lost my job three weeks ago and can't find another. Think I care
how many times Bush mentioned Simon's name? Think again. I say get
Davis out of office before he does any more harm.</TE>
<TE>   William Fortuna</TE>
<TE>   Northridge</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So Bush, whose three Texas oil ventures all failed, lauds GOP
gubernatorial candidate Simon, loser of a $78-million judgment for
defrauding an investment partner, as a "proven businessman." As they
say, it takes one to know one.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Gold</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As of late, if any Democrat (or anybody, for that matter) has
dared to disagree with anything he said, Bush's favorite phrase for
an instant defense has been: "Smells like politics." That is how he
waves off any form of disagreement.</TE>
<TE>   Bush takes the holier-than-thou tone when issuing the "smells like
politics" decree, as if all who disagree with him are doing so only
to play politics, not because their thoughts have any merit. Well, I
wonder if the president would like to try his hand at characterizing
his recent action of secretly endorsing Simon, very warmly, stating
he's proud to associate with him--at a private affair--but not
speaking Simon's name while the cameras roll. If the president is at
a loss for words (which he so often is), I have a perfect phrase to
offer up: smells like politics.</TE>

opposition and tell us what they can and will do for us if elected. I
will not vote for a candidate who slings mud at his opponent. Oh
well, I guess that just leaves all the propositions.</TE>

<LD>Re "Assembly Passes Bill to Raise Smoking Age," Aug. 22: This is
ludicrous. The purchase restriction on 18-year-olds doesn't prevent
thousands of kids between 12 and 18 from lighting up every day now,
so how will raising the age to 21 prevent those between 18 and 21
from smoking? In a country where we trust 18-year-olds with the
responsibility of voting for the leader of the free world, where our
legal system says 18-year-olds are adults and can be punished
accordingly, and where an 18-year-old can be drafted to fight in a
time of war, that same 18-year-old can't be trusted to make a
decision to buy alcohol, gamble or now, possibly, buy cigarettes.</LD>
<LD>   I do not smoke and I despise the habit, but this is such a waste
of time and money. I think the state Assembly needs to spend its time
passing legislation that actually matters.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Smoky View of Libertarianism," by Norah Vincent, Commentary,
Aug. 22: Yeehaaa! You go, girl! Eloquent, accurate and well informed.
As an asthmatic, I look forward to the day when my struggle with the
disability is greater than my struggle with certain people's willful
ignorance of and hostility toward it.</TE>
<TE>   If smokers were as tolerant of the genuine needs of others as they
expect us all to be of their convenience, we wouldn't need laws.
Those who don't like public smoking bans have no one to blame but
themselves when we have to resort to legislation to enforce good
manners and common sense.</TE>

<TE>   The only one ignoring the central tenet of libertarian philosophy

force as a means of achieving political or social goals.</TE>
<TE>   If people do not like smoking in bars and restaurants, they are
free to stay away from bars and restaurants where it is allowed, and
they are free to establish bars and restaurants where it is
prohibited. Similarly, people who like to smoke in bars and
restaurants should be free to do so if they please.</TE>
<TE>   The problems start when one side seeks to use the power of
government to impose its position on the other. Imagine how indignant
Vincent would be about the assault on her rights if New York City
passed a law requiring all bars and restaurants to allow smoking.</TE>

<TE>   Vincent posits that smokers harm others, even if they smoke alone,
because they cost the public millions in insurance premiums and
health-care services. I must be missing a point here. Everyone dies
of something. We all have to be treated eventually, and that
treatment has a cost. What is the cost to treat someone with cancer
who has never smoked compared with that of someone with the disease
who has? If the costs are the same, how is smoking or not smoking an
issue?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thank you very much for "L.A. Schools Set to Can Soda Sales" (Aug.
25). As a registered dietitian, I firmly support a ban of soda from
the L.A. Unified School District schools. Our children need to get
"used to water" and to drink a beverage other than "something that
has sugar." I congratulate Veronica Reyes' mother for at least trying
to make her daughter drink water. Many parents don't even attempt to
teach other hydration methods to their children. No wonder the
incidences of obesity and diabetes have risen coincidently with soda
intake.</LD>
<LD>   By banning soda at schools we would not be "taking away" any
extracurricular activities. We can easily teach our children to save
the money they would have otherwise spent on their daily sodas for
something they can at least gain physical activity from--say, a
school dance.</LD>

<TE>   Banning sodas from schools: another case of throwing out the baby
with the bathwater. Why not simply ban sugar in the drinks? Diet
sodas would give students the carbonation and taste they enjoy
without adding calories and would continue to earn those badly needed
payments (from beverage companies). A sugar-free, win-win solution.</TE>

<HD>Closing of Hospital Could Prove Traumatic</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital is an essential part of our local
health-care infrastructure ("Closures Put Big Hospital Chains Under
Microscope," Aug. 22). It must not be allowed to close. Its emergency
room is the nearest to LAX--an acknowledged terrorist target. There
is no other emergency room south of the 10 Freeway and west of the
405 Freeway between Santa Monica and Torrance, so it would be a
necessary part of dealing with a disaster in the event that a major
earthquake damaged freeway bridges.</LD>
<LD>   Area emergency rooms are already overburdened, and the influx of
residents to the nearby Playa Vista development will only add to the
problem. There is no clearer example of a situation in which the
quest for maximizing corporate profit conflicts with the needs of the
community. Government must in some cases override the impulse of the
free market in order to protect the common good. Thankfully, many of
our elected officials are fighting on our behalf.</LD>

<TE>   It's very depressing to a Westside resident to read of the
potential closing of the Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital. The Camden
Group's assessment that the hospital was not "financially tenable"
because of limited population projections (among other reasons) is
ludicrous. Isn't anyone taking into account the new Playa Vista
project? With so many hospital closings, my biggest fear is not
terrorists. My biggest fear is that I'll have a heart attack and not
have an emergency room open nearby.</TE>

<LD>The decades-long-overdue overhaul of "big" and "little" Santa Monica
boulevards between Sepulveda Boulevard and Beverly Hills is a great
idea ("Some Fear Bumpy Ride During Street's Makeover," Aug. 22). As a
Los Angeles native, I applaud the plan. Too long have such Los
Angeles standouts as Westwood Gateway Towers, the Mormon temple,
Century City and the Beverly Hilton Hotel been fronted by the ugly
streetscape and unsightly median of the two Santa Monica boulevards.
Yes, there might be inconveniences to local businesses, but the end
result will benefit everyone.</LD>

<LD>Why does the renovation of downtown's skid row area have to be a
clash between developers who seek an urban renaissance and low-income
people who are displaced by gentrification (Aug. 24)? It is too bad
that those who want to make our city a better place to live and work
sometimes end up displacing those who struggle to find a simple roof
over their heads.</LD>
<LD>   Is this really a struggle between the haves and have-nots, the
rich and the poor? I don't think so. This is more like everyone
fighting for bread crumbs on the floor. Until our city builds enough
low-income housing for all, everyone in our community will suffer the
effects, including those on skid row.</LD>

<HD>D.A. Denies Claims of Favoritism</HD>
<DH>Probe: Rackauckas' 153-page response says O.C. grand
jury's 'one- sided' report lacks merit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas went on the offensive
Monday against a grand jury report accusing him of favoritism and
helping campaign donors, dismissing the study as baseless and
one-sided.</LD>
<LD>   Rackauckas said the investigation was orchestrated by disgruntled
prosecutors who backed his rival in the last two elections.</LD>
<LD>   "The grand jury received a somewhat one-sided view of recent
history, apparently a view promulgated by opponents of the changes
this administration brought," Rackauckas said in his 153-page
response. "It does not appear coincidental that the complaints that
prompted the inquiry were made just months before the March 2002
district attorney election."</LD>
<TE>   A grand jury spent eight months investigating an assortment of
allegations against Rackauckas after three of his top prosecutors
complained to the state attorney general's office. In June, the panel
accused Rackauckas of punishing his enemies with reassignments and
early retirement offers while rewarding friends and political backers
with jobs or by meddling in cases on their behalf.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury provided 64 recommendations, including that
Rackauckas be barred from selecting new attorneys for the office.
Rackauckas said he rejected 30 of the recommendations and that the
remainder had been initiated before the report came out.</TE>
<TE>   The report claimed that Don Blankenship, the chief of
investigations for the office, double-billed the office thousands of
dollars for meals and drinks with colleagues, lobbyists and
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said his office investigated the accusations and found
that overpayments to Blankenship totaled $209.45, which he has
repaid.</TE>
<TE>   He also denied a contention of the grand jury that his wife, Kay,
a deputy prosecutor, held great influence over office policies.</TE>
<TE>   "Ms. Rackauckas was neither given nor permitted a greater level of
authority and influence than is characteristic of her job
description," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas, who testified before the grand jury for two days in
March, said the report "simply lacked merit" and he "wholly
disagreed" with the majority of its 92 findings.</TE>
<TE>   He argued that witnesses with information that might have
countered the allegations were never called to testify, leading to
what he called an unbalanced and unfair account of his
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas defended his record of four years in office, focusing
on the drop in violent crime and the dramatic improvement in
child-support cases.</TE>
<TE>   He also declared that office morale is good, saying reports to the
contrary have been propelled by "a small but vocal minority with
their own political and personal agenda."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas' arguments echo comments he made when the grand jury
report was released. Whenever a grand jury files a report about a
county agency, by law the agency must file a formal response within
30 days.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas, a former judge who was first elected as the county's
top prosecutor in 1998 and then again two years ago, continues to
blame the investigation on leftovers from the previous administration
who supported the campaign of former Deputy Dist. Atty. Wally Wade,
whom he faced in both elections.</TE>
<TE>   "When, as a result of an election, a new leader is selected, and a
new course charted, anger and outright opposition from within this
entrenched group may ensue," Rackauckas said in his rebuttal.</TE>
<TE>   Wade said Monday that the grand jury is an experienced,
independent body with no political agendas.</TE>
<TE>   He took issue with Rackauckas' spin of its conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   "What he's basically saying is that the grand jury violated its
oath, and that the attorney general of the state of California helped
them violate their oath," Wade said.</TE>
<TE>   In a related matter, lawyers for Rackauckas and the county are
asking the attorney general to hand over confidential information
from the grand jury investigation, arguing they need the records to
defend a wrongful termination lawsuit filed by former Assistant Dist.
Atty. Michael Jacobs.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs was one of the prosecutors who met with the attorney
general's office last winter to raise the allegations of misconduct
against Rackauckas.</TE>
<TE>   He alleges in his lawsuit that he was fired for reporting the
abuse of public resources and political cronyism within the D.A.'s
office.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Assistant Atty. Gen. Gary Schons, who works in the San
Diego office that handled the case, declined to comment.</TE>

<HD>INS Backlog Deal Frees Lives on Hold</HD>
<DH>Immigration: Pact means people awaiting their documents can
work and attend school.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>About 25,000 immigrants waiting for their residency applications to
be processed by immigration officials can work and go to school in
the United States under a preliminary settlement reached Monday in
federal court in Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement is expected to end a 2-year-old class-action lawsuit
filed by relatives of immigrants granted legal immigrant status under
a 1986 amnesty program.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement would allow spouses and children of amnesty
recipients to become U.S. residents, clarifying provisions of the
federal Family Unity Program adopted in 1990 to prevent families from
splitting up.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service had delayed the
family unity application process in the late 1990s. As a result, many
immigrants who applied for residency never received the federal
documents they needed to find employment, and the delays prevented
others from renewing their residency.</TE>
<TE>   "Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs, their opportunity to
attend public institutions of education, or their driver's licenses,"
said Andrew Knapp, a Los Angeles attorney for one of eight
plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed settlement, the INS would work 16 hours a day
to process Family Unity Program applications and renewals when
backlogs exist. The settlement also ensures that immigrants will get
authorization to work and attend school while renewal applications
are being processed.</TE>
<TE>   "The settlement allows them to exercise rights given to them in a
law in 1990," said Linton Joaquin, an attorney with the American
Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles who filed the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   INS officials said Monday that the backlog has been eliminated
since the lawsuit was filed.</TE>
<TE>   "We will carefully monitor the situation to make sure it doesn't
happen again," said spokeswoman Lori Haley.</TE>
<TE>   The INS will still be able to deport people while their
applications are pending, but each action will be determined after a
review.</TE>
<TE>   The preliminary settlement will go before the plaintiffs and, if
they approve the terms, final approval will be considered Oct. 28 by
U.S. District Court Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler, Joaquin said.</TE>
<TE>   Gustavo Escutia Steiner, 29, the principal plaintiff, said it took
18 months for his work authorization to be renewed, and during that
period he could not get another job.</TE>
<TE>   "If I lose this job, I am afraid that I will not be able to find
another job because I cannot show that I am authorized to work in the
United States," Escutia said in the legal action.</TE>

<HD>Blake Defense Requests an Extension</HD>
<DH>Courts: Lawyers say they need more time to go over the
evidence. Judge may set preliminary hearing date today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An attorney for Robert Blake said Monday that the actor "would rather
sit in jail than have his defense compromised" at a rushed
preliminary hearing.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for Blake and his co-defendant, Earle S. Caldwell, asked
a judge on Monday to delay until November a preliminary hearing in
the celebrity murder case.</LD>
<LD>   They say they cannot prepare an adequate defense without more time
to read and analyze the 42,000 pages of evidence that the prosecution
has produced since their clients were arrested April 18 in the
shooting death of Blake's wife, Bonny Lee Bakley. The defense
received the latest installment--more than 7,000 pages--on Aug. 19.</LD>
<TE>   Nonetheless, prosecutors have asked Los Angeles County Superior
Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash to start the preliminary hearing within 10
days. Nash is expected to set a date today in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   In his motion for a continuance, Blake's attorney, Harland W.
Braun, said the documents produced by prosecutors show that they have
"overlooked significant evidence," including a tape recording of
Bakley allegedly encouraging another person to kill the wife of
singer Jerry Lee Lewis so that Bakley could marry him.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also ignored a letter Bakley wrote to her parole
officer allegedly complaining that she had been "almost killed a
half-dozen times," according to Braun's motion. (Bakley had been
convicted in Arkansas of possessing fake identification.) Bakley also
told Blake in a taped conversation that she was being stalked, the
motion said.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said he has found no evidence that authorities followed up
on any of these allegations in their yearlong murder investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Bakley, 44, was fatally shot May 4, 2001, near a Studio City
restaurant where she and Blake had dined.</TE>
<TE>   Almost a year later, Blake was charged with murder, conspiracy and
two counts of soliciting Bakley's murder, with the special
circumstance of lying in wait. Prosecutors have said they will not
seek the death penalty against Blake, the star of the 1970s
television series "Baretta." He is being held without bail at Men's
Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell, 46, is charged with conspiring with Blake to kill
Bakley. He was released from jail eight days after his arrest when
Blake posted his $1-million bail.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Attys. Patrick R. Dixon and Gregory A. Dohi contend
in court papers that the investigative reports, interview
transcripts, phone records and documentary evidence they have turned
over to defense attorneys in recent months "can be reviewed quickly."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think they need a 90-day delay," said Sandi Gibbons, a
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office.
"They don't need every piece of evidence" to proceed with a
preliminary hearing, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Caldwell's attorney, Arna H. Zlotnik, said in an interview
that it is "totally unreasonable" and "ridiculous" for prosecutors to
try to force her to "read and digest" the 7,000 pages of evidence
produced last week and be prepared to defend her client within the
next two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   She said she blames prosecutors for the needed delay: "They are
trying to dictate how the defense runs their case."</TE>
<TE>   When Blake and Caldwell were arrested, she said, "The
investigation of this case was nowhere near complete nor organized in
a fashion sufficient to proceed with a timely prosecution."</TE>
<TE>   In a separate motion filed Monday, Braun opposed Nash's decision
to allow cameras in the courtroom. Nash previously had banned them.</TE>
<TE>   Braun argued that televising courtroom proceedings pressures
witnesses either to refuse to testify in court or to exaggerate their
testimony. The "circus atmosphere" created by live television also
"diminishes the public trust in the judicial system," he wrote.</TE>

<HD>Cal State Fullerton Students Reporting for Duty at El Toro</HD>
<DH>Education: Classes get underway at the new branch campus on
the former Marine base. The 11-acre facility can accommodate 3,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The blackboards--they're whiteboards these days--didn't arrive until
Monday morning and still hadn't been installed.</LD>
<LD>   The classrooms smelled of new paint, and until the cafeteria is
completed, students and faculty will have to buy food from a Carl's
Jr. trailer in the parking lot.</LD>
<LD>   Little of that mattered, though, as Cal State Fullerton opened a
branch campus Monday on 11 acres of what used to be the El Toro
Marine base.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of Marines wandering through the Wing Command
Headquarters, college students will take classes at the brown,
two-story Spanish-style compound the university spent $1.3 million
converting into 22 classrooms and 48 offices.</TE>
<TE>   Satellite campuses are nothing new for Cal State Fullerton, which
offers classes in Garden Grove, Santa Ana and Irvine. For nearly 13
years, the university had its largest satellite campus at Saddleback
College in Mission Viejo, which about 1,200 students attended. But
when the Marines announced plans to exit the base in 1993, university
officials saw an opportunity to serve South County students--who make
up about 20% of the university's enrollment--with a larger facility.
The lease was signed last spring.</TE>
<TE>   The El Toro campus will offer 200 classes for 2,400 juniors and
seniors. It has the room to handle an additional 600 students, said
George Giacumakis, director of the campus. "We had truly outgrown
Saddleback," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Eight hundred students are expected to take classes just at El
Toro, with the rest also taking them in Fullerton, many using the
shuttle between campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Among students who take classes on both campuses is Kent Webber,
23, a speech communications major completing his final semester. The
drive to El Toro from his home in Irvine is just eight minutes. He is
taking classes there in Chicano history and criminal justice on
Mondays and Wednesdays and three classes at Fullerton on Tuesdays and
Thursdays. Besides the short commute, he said he likes the idea of
taking classes on a smaller campus; the Fullerton campus accommodates
most of the university's 30,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Fullerton, which administrators say is the
fastest-growing CSU campus, has had six consecutive semesters of
record-breaking enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   "I would think a lot of people who live in this area would rush to
take classes here," said Webber, sitting on a stairway talking to a
friend as he waited for his class to start.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Easier Parking Than at the Main Campus</TE>
<TE>   Justin Murrietta, 24, decided to take classes in El Toro even
though he lives in Yorba Linda, 10 minutes from the main campus. Like
other students, he had heard stories about monumental parking
problems at Fullerton, where drivers have been known to follow
students to their vehicles to take their parking spots.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Fullerton has a three-year lease that pays the Navy
about $527,000 annually for the land. The university expects to work
out a long-term arrangement, said Paula Selleck, a university
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The university's goal is to obtain all 276 acres dedicated to
education under Irvine's plan for a Great Park to replace the former
base, Giacumakis said. The Navy plans to turn over 80% of El Toro's
4,738 acres--a site once proposed as an airport--to Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Several Cal State campuses began as satellite campuses. San Marcos
was attached to San Diego State, Cal State Monterey Bay was
affiliated with San Jose State and Cal State Channel Islands was part
of Cal State Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't mean the El Toro campus is on its way to becoming
an independent campus. Colleen Bentley Adler, a spokeswoman for the
CSU system, said that proximity to other campuses and enormous
expense of construction are the primary concerns about building a
campus.</TE>
<TE>   She said off-campus centers, such as El Toro, are a way to
compensate for overcrowded campuses. "We think it's a good solution
for not having to build a full, new campus," she said.</TE>

<HD>Woman Feared Husband, Co-Workers Testify</HD>
<DH>Court: Prosecutors say Alfonso Castillo, accused of
strangling his wife and cutting up her body, killed her because she
threatened to leave him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Months before her gruesome death, Maria Pinaloza Ambario confided to
co-workers that her husband beat her constantly and she feared he
would kill her.</LD>
<LD>   "She would tell me that he would beat her up," said Sonia
Rodriguez, who testified Monday during the Ventura County murder
trial of Ambario's husband and accused killer, Alfonso Castillo.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez and other employees at the food-packaging company where
Ambario, 34, worked told the judge presiding over Castillo's trial
that Ambario often showed up to work with bruises on her body.</LD>
<TE>   "She was always arriving black-and-blue--everywhere," Rodriguez
said. "A lot of mistreatment."</TE>
<TE>   Castillo, 38, a Panorama City tile setter, is charged with
first-degree murder for allegedly strangling Ambario, cutting up her
body and dumping the remains off the Ventura County coast.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend that Castillo killed his wife of two years
after she threatened to leave him.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo was arrested Dec. 6 after a Ventura County sheriff's
deputy stopped near Mugu Rock to investigate an illegally parked
truck and spotted Castillo, splattered in blood, climbing up a rocky
area from the surf.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo told authorities the blood on his clothes came from a cut
on his arm and that he was climbing the rocks to dispose of a cat he
had run over earlier that evening, according to court testimony.</TE>
<TE>   But deputies shining searchlights on the water saw human limbs
floating in the surf and later recovered several of Ambario's body
parts, including her head.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Dean Hawley of the Indiana University medical school testified
that hemorrhages near the eyes suggest Ambario was strangled before
being dismembered.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Sgt. James Panza told Superior Court Judge Herbert
Curtis III that he found trash bags, gloves and a plastic storage bin
during a search of Castillo's truck.</TE>
<TE>   Panza said he also found a Wal-Mart sales receipt for a chef's
knife. The receipt shows the sale occurred Dec. 5 at 5:18 p.m.
Prosecutors suspect Castillo had strangled Ambario the day before.</TE>
<TE>   During a search of Castillo's apartment, Panza found a bow saw and
plastic sheeting on the floor. Panza said he also found a human heart
inside the garbage disposal.</TE>
<TE>   Friend Maria Gutierres testified that, three months before her
death, Ambario left the apartment she shared with Castillo and moved
in with Gutierres. But she said Ambario stayed only one night before
returning to her husband.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Officer Carol Hale testified that in June 2000
she responded to a domestic-violence call at the couple's apartment.
Hale took photographs of a bruised Ambario, who had allegedly been
hit in the face. Hale said Ambario refused an emergency protective
order.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo, who waived his right to a jury trial, is being held in
lieu of bail of more than $1 million. His trial is expected to last
about a week. Testimony is scheduled to resume today.</TE>

<HD>First Day of Class Has Special Feel at Long-Awaited Cal
State Campus</HD>
<DH>Camarillo: Students and faculty alike share giddy pride at
opening of Channel Islands facility. Enrollment of 750 is projected
to eventually top 20,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't a bad way to start the school year.</LD>
<LD>   Students arriving Monday for the historic opening day at Cal State
Channel Islands found administrators swarming the halls, eager to
offer guidance. They found an assortment of snacks--popcorn, snow
cones and chips--available for free on the campus quad.</LD>
<LD>   And they were likely to find themselves face-to-face with
university President Richard Rush, who spent the morning dispensing
welcomes and chocolate silver dollars to members of Channel Islands'
inaugural class.</LD>
<TE>   "It's really awesome," said Ventura native Christine Rodrigues,
28, a biology major who transferred to the new university from Oxnard
College.</TE>
<TE>   Rodrigues and fellow student Nicole Manzano, both mothers with
1-year-old sons, created a child-care cooperative that turned out be
one of the first clubs on campus.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been hearing about this [creation of a Ventura County
campus] since high school," Rodrigues said. "It's such a big deal,
and I just think it's great to be part of it from the beginning."</TE>
<TE>   After more than 30 years of planning and preparation,
heartbreaking setbacks and heart-pounding successes, Ventura County's
first four-year public university opened its doors Monday, ushering
in its inaugural class of 750 students.</TE>
<TE>   The opening of the university, set in a series of renovated,
1930s-era buildings at the former Camarillo State Hospital,
culminates a decades-long dream to deliver a four-year college to a
region where generations of students have had no choice but to leave
if they wanted a state college degree.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, until Monday, Ventura County was the largest county in
California without a public four-year university.</TE>
<TE>   Boosters had cited that void as a stumbling block for local
students in their pursuit of four-year college degrees.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign to establish the campus took a major step forward in
1998, when CSU trustees endorsed a plan to convert the shuttered
state hospital into the 23rd campus in the Cal State University
system.</TE>
<TE>   By fall of the next year, a satellite campus of Cal State
Northridge had moved to the current Channel Islands site, providing
the seeds from which the new four-year campus would grow.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this a great day or what?" said Maria Tauber, who has had a
front-row seat for the evolution. She started working at the CSUN
off-campus center in 1997, and now is an administrator in the records
and registrar's office at Channel Islands.</TE>
<TE>   With students strolling across campus and a line forming in the
bookstore, Tauber said it was hard to believe that opening day had
finally arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "Talk about an adrenaline rush," she said.</TE>
<TE>   There were plenty of first-day jitters, even for some faculty
members.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Irina Costache ran into Rush in the hallway on the way
to teach her first class. "I'm ready and excited to be here," she
told him, showing up for class 45 minutes early.</TE>
<TE>   In class, a study of art and culture, her 30 students appeared
just as eager.</TE>
<TE>   Costache learned that many had transferred to Channel Islands from
local community colleges. Some had even come from CSUN's main campus,
where Costache had previously taught.</TE>
<TE>   "Now you don't have to commute," she told them. "You have your own
university in your own backyard."</TE>
<TE>   Launching the campus was just the first step in a long process
that will eventually see the addition of dormitories, sports teams
and the other trappings of an established school as it swells to more
than 20,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   Rush said the university this fall will face another review of its
academic plan as it moves toward accreditation.</TE>
<TE>   And already, recruitment of more students for the fall semester is
underway.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the matter of recruitment next year of the
university's first crop of freshmen, since the inaugural class at
Channel Islands is made up of only upper-division transfer students.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have all of our other deadlines to meet," Rush said.
"Really, it's only the beginning."</TE>

<HD>Prime Seats for Bush Visit Cause Row</HD>
<DH>Police: O.C. sheriff's officials say Santa Ana chief
threatened to arrest them unless they vacated space at Bowers Museum
for president's speech.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush left Santa Ana on Friday. But a dispute between Santa
Ana's police chief and a contingent from the Orange County Sheriff's
Department who wanted front-row seats for the president's visit
continued to simmer Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Some sheriff's officials in the group said they were threatened
with arrest by Santa Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters if they didn't
give up their choice vantage point at the Bowers Museum of Cultural
Art.</LD>
<LD>   Walters reportedly told the group--including Assistant Sheriff
George Jaramillo; his wife, Lisa; Debbie Carona, wife of Sheriff Mike
Carona, and their son, Matthew; and sheriff's Lt. Wilfred Moreno --to
leave a roped-off area where Bush was scheduled to shake hands after
his remarks.</LD>
<TE>   "He told everyone to get out of the area, that it was only for
VIPs," Moreno said Monday. "He warned them if they didn't get out, he
would get his guys and have them arrested. For Chief Walters to
handle the situation as he did, it was very insulting."</TE>
<TE>   Walters was on vacation Monday and attempts to reach him for
comment were unsuccessful. Santa Ana police officials said they were
unaware of any problems.</TE>
<TE>   Auto dealer Dennis Assael of Newport Beach said he also attended
the event with the Sheriff's Department group, whose members had been
invited by Mayor Miguel A. Pulido.</TE>
<TE>   They checked in as VIPs and staked out spots at the Bowers for an
hour before being approached by Pulido's assistant, Jill Arthur, who
told them to leave because the area was reserved.When Jaramillo
refused, Arthur came back with Walters. Jaramillo and Moreno spoke
separately with Walters, who again ordered the group to leave,
several group members said.</TE>
<TE>   "[Walters] said, 'If you don't move now, I'm going to throw you in
jail,' " Assael said.</TE>
<TE>   Pulido and Arthur declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Jaramillo said there were "problems created by Chief Paul
Walters.... We're handling these privately with Chief Walters and
Mayor Pulido and we hope to be able to work it out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some who attended Friday's event said the incident was evidence of
lingering bad blood between Walters, who ran for sheriff against
Carona in 1998, and Jaramillo, who ran Carona's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the Sheriff's Department group got more than it hoped
from Bush's visit.</TE>
<TE>   Mario Rodriguez, a San Clemente businessman and Republican
supporter, invited them to come upstairs, with Pulido's blessing,
where they visited with Bush and took photographs. The president even
signed a get-well card for Jaramillo's ailing mother.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an incident that shouldn't have happened," Rodriguez said.
"I'm glad we were able to resolve it."</TE>

<DH>Politics: Judge orders Stanton ballot changed after legal
challenge by incumbents.</DH>

<LD>An Orange County Superior Court judge Monday ordered the registrar of
voters to excise about 30% of a Stanton City Council candidate's
voter pamphlet statement, which opponents had charged was
unsubstantiated by fact.</LD>
<LD>   Responding to a lawsuit filed by three incumbent City Council
members against their lone challenger in the Nov. 5 election, Judge
David A. Thompson ordered that about 60 of the 193 words in candidate
Kevin F. Carr's statement of qualifications be stricken. "It
appears," the judge instructed county Registrar Rosalyn Lever and
Stanton City Clerk Brenda Green, "that you should not have accepted
... a candidate statement containing the items hereinafter
described."</LD>
<LD>   Among the statements to be deleted were a negative comment
regarding the city's utility tax and a sentence contending that "our
city has been mismanaged so badly for so many years that the entire
city is now a rehabilitation zone and some are proud of that fact."</LD>
<TE>   Carr could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman David John Shawver, who had filed the lawsuit with
Mayor Brian Donahue and Councilman Harry M. Dotson, said the ruling
helped bring "a little bit of integrity back to our election."</TE>
<TE>   "Legal precedents have held that the voter guide is not a place to
rip your opponent or put out ... untruths," he said.</TE>

relatives of the three victims.</LD>
<LD>   Kirk Premo, 32, son of West Anaheim Medical Center nursing

Sept. 14, 1999, said: "I'll never understand. I'll never understand
why this happened."</LD>
<LD>   Mustaffa's husband, Dave, said his wife "was a very beautiful
woman, very gentle [and] always had something nice to say. She just
had a way about her that people loved her."</LD>
<TE>   On Aug. 19, jurors took less than three hours to convict Trinh of
the slayings of Mustaffa, 60, and Ronald Robertson and Vince Rosetti,

<LD>Brea police Monday described an object found on a city sidewalk over
the weekend as a makeshift pyrotechnical bomb that could have
seriously injured or killed someone had it exploded.</LD>
<LD>   "It was similar to a pipe bomb, about 6 inches in length," Lt.
Martin Needham, a spokesman for the Brea Police Department, said of
the device, found by a jogger about 8 a.m. Sunday in the 1200 block
of West Lambert Road. "It had destructive capabilities."</LD>
<LD>   Police evacuated about 225 people from a nearby Calvary Chapel and
a gas station for two hours while the Orange County sheriff's bomb
squad used a robot to secure and defuse the device.</LD>
<TE>   "It wasn't close enough to any people or businesses to make us
think that someone was being targeted," Needham said. "It could have
been inadvertently left there or thrown out of a car."</TE>
<TE>   The incident is being investigated, he said.</TE>

<DH>Sun Valley: A zoning variance is expiring for the Theodore
Payne Foundation, which promotes native plants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Time is running out for the Theodore Payne Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   For almost 30 years, the nonprofit organization has sold
wildflowers and other native plants out of a modest wooden building
in Sun Valley.</LD>
<LD>   But the zoning variance that allows it to operate its current
office expires Sept. 14. Unless a new variance is approved by the
city of Los Angeles, the foundation will have to find another home
from which to preach the virtues of native plants.</LD>
<TE>   "There's nothing in our application that's new," said John
Wickham, treasurer of the foundation's board.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation applied for the new variance in July, asking the
city to allow it to continue to operate just as it has for decades,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Named for a pioneering horticulturist who made more than 400
species of California plants available to home gardeners, the
Theodore Payne Foundation controls two adjoining parcels of land off
West Tuxford Street in Sun Valley. Its extensive nursery is on the
larger, 20-acre parcel. That property is mostly hillside, with a
relatively small, flat area where native plants are propagated and
nurtured. Zoned for agricultural use, it needs no variance to
function as it now does.</TE>
<TE>   The controversial parcel is 1.2 acres to the south, closest to
West Tuxford Street. The small plot includes the office
building--recently rid of termites and repainted--parking lots and a
picnic area. Lizards skitter across the property, deer sometimes
wander behind the office, and its richly scented sages and other
plants are labeled with both their common and scientific names.</TE>
<TE>   To maximize the likelihood that a variance will be granted, the
foundation hired Glendale land-use consultants Novak + Associates.</TE>
<TE>   As foundation President Ellen Mackey explained in a recent mailing
to the foundation's 900 members, the cost of obtaining the variance
is expected to be $20,000 or more, including application fees of
several thousand dollars and the cost of the consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Like most zoning issues, the foundation's application has brought
neighborhood tensions to the surface.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation recently sent letters to nearby residents, asking
them to share any gripes.</TE>
<TE>   Wickham said the city received a letter from a neighbor worried
about fire danger; the foundation has been clearing brush within 200
feet of nearby buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors also complained of the traffic on a road the foundation
shares with some residents. The deeply rutted road is unpaved, and
dust is an issue, Wickham said, as is the caretaker's dog, which has
strayed on a few occasions.</TE>
<TE>   "If that's the extent of the problem, it's easy to fix," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the city will let us operate there while the application
is pending," said Orest Dolyniuk, the Novak consultant. He said the
decision process usually takes three to four months.</TE>
<TE>   If the variance is denied, the foundation might be able to move
its operation up the hill, off the contested parcel. But building a
new office and sales facility would be expensive--in excess of
$100,000, Wickham estimated.</TE>
<TE>   The worst-case scenario would be having to move to a new location.
"By operating where we are, we have the opportunity to develop some
nice demonstration gardens to support our educational mission,"
Wickham said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Moorpark man was fined $5,000 and sentenced to one year of
probation Monday in the 1994 blast that killed two scientists at the
Santa Susana Field Laboratory near Simi Valley.</LD>
<LD>   James F. Weber, 52, the first former Rocketdyne employee to be
sentenced in the case, pleaded guilty last August to one misdemeanor
count of unlawfully storing explosive materials. As part of his plea,
Weber agreed to testify against his two co-defendants, but
prosecutors never called him as a witness.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Court Judge Robert J. Timlin imposed the sentence.</LD>
<TE>   Weber's co-defendants, Joseph E. Flanagan, 61, of Stanwood, Wash.,
and Edgar R. Wilson, 65, of Chatsworth, were accused of illegally
burning chemical waste at the field laboratory on July 21 and 26,
1994.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan, then director of Rocketdyne's Chemical Technology Group,
also was charged with illegal waste storage.</TE>
<TE>   Each felony count carries a maximum penalty of five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   In March, after a four-month trial, a Riverside jury deadlocked 10
to 2 in favor of guilt on all of the charges.</TE>
<TE>   The case was tried in Riverside because it was randomly assigned
to Timlin, who is part of the federal court's Central California
District, based in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than face a retrial, Flanagan pleaded guilty in June to two
misdemeanor counts of illegally storing explosive materials. He now
faces up to a year in federal prison and a $100,000 fine on each
count. His sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson's retrial is set for Feb. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged that the defendants violated federal
environmental laws when they burned chemicals at the outdoor test
site.</TE>
<TE>   During the burn on July 26, 1994, the chemicals accidentally
exploded, killing Otto K. Heiney, 53, of Canoga Park, and Larry A.
Pugh, 51, of Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Weber and Wilson were present when the explosion occurred;
Flanagan, who supervised the scientists, was not.</TE>

<LD>A community celebration will be held Sept. 7 to dedicate a new park
in honor of Delores Day, Fillmore's first female mayor.</LD>
<LD>   The nearly five-acre park, at 5th Street and Goodenough Road, is
part of a 10.8-acre parcel donated to the city by Griffin Industries,
which built the 135-home Hometown housing development. The remainder
of the land is the site of a future elementary school.</LD>
<LD>   Day, 81, was a member of the Fillmore City Council from 1970 to
1990 and served as mayor five times, beginning in 1977.</LD>
<TE>   "She championed so many improvements for Fillmore, and she was
truly a servant of the public," said Mayor Pro Tem Linda Brewster.</TE>
<TE>   Hot dogs, popcorn, soda and other refreshments will be available
at the 11 a.m. dedication. For more information, call 524-3701.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The former director of Ventura County's Behavioral Health Department
has been hired as medical director of Simi Valley Hospital's
behavioral health unit.</LD>
<LD>   David Gudeman, a UCLA-trained psychiatrist and internist, began
his current job July 24. He oversees the hospital's 32-bed,
acute-care psychiatric unit, which is a locked, inpatient facility
for adults.</LD>
<LD>   "His ability and expertise will be an asset to the hospital as a
whole and to this community," said Margaret R. Peterson, the
hospital's president and chief executive.</LD>
<TE>   Gudeman, who ran the county's $50-million, 450-employee agency for
three years, was terminated in April amid accusations of low morale,
a lack of cooperation with other county departments and that his
department unnecessarily blocked treatment of juveniles.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Shirley Slater, 67, who with her husband, Harry Basch, formed a
popular travel writing team adept at evaluating cruise ships and
recreational vehicles, died Friday in Los Angeles of complications of
cancer and chemotherapy.</LD>
<LD>   The couple created a column called Cruise Views for The Times'
Sunday travel section in 1984 and remained regular contributors to
the newspaper for 18 years. Slater was also a food writer who
contributed to Bon Appetit magazine. Slater and Basch were also known
for their advisory travel books, including the annual "Fielding
Worldwide Cruise Guides" for 1996 through 1999, Fielding's
"Freewheelin' USA," two editions of Frommer's "Exploring America by
RV" and the not-yet-published "RV Vacations for Dummies." A Times
review praised the 1995 "Freewheelin' " as "a very comprehensive
guide for the RV traveler" and added, "A breezy style makes
'Freewheelin' ' lots more fun than most guides of this sort."</LD>
<LD>   Born in Lynchburg, Va., Slater grew up in Mount Airy, N.C., and
earned a journalism degree from the University of Georgia.</LD>
<TE>   After helping create an eight-station public broadcasting network
in Georgia, she turned to acting, working with the American
Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   She also appeared in plays at the Ahmanson Theater and was in such
films as "The Candidate" and such television series as "The Waltons."</TE>

<HD>Rackauckas Denies Claims of Favoritism</HD>
<DH>Law enforcement: In his 153-page response to an Orange
County Grand Jury report, D.A. says the study was one-sided and the
result of complaints from political rivals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas went on the offensive
Monday against a grand jury report accusing him of favoritism and
helping campaign donors, dismissing the study as baseless and
one-sided.</LD>
<LD>   Rackauckas said the investigation was orchestrated by disgruntled
prosecutors who backed his rival in the last two elections.</LD>
<LD>   "The grand jury received a somewhat one-sided view of recent
history, apparently a view promulgated by opponents of the changes
this administration brought," Rackauckas said in his 153-page
response. "It does not appear coincidental that the complaints that
prompted the inquiry were made just months before the March 2002
district attorney election."</LD>
<TE>   The grand jury spent eight months investigating an assortment of
allegations against Rackauckas after three of his top prosecutors
complained to the state attorney general's office. In June, the panel
accused Rackauckas of punishing his enemies with reassignments and
early retirement offers while rewarding friends and political backers
with jobs or by meddling in cases on their behalf.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury provided 64 recommendations, including that
Rackauckas be barred from selecting new attorneys for the office.
Rackauckas said he rejected 30 of the recommendations and that the
remainder had been initiated before the report came out.</TE>
<TE>   The report claimed that Don Blankenship, the chief of
investigations for the office, double-billed the office thousands of
dollars for meals and drinks with colleagues, lobbyists and
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said his office investigated the accusations and found
that overpayments to Blankenship totaled $209.45, which he has
repaid.</TE>
<TE>   He also denied a contention of the grand jury that his wife, Kay,
a deputy prosecutor, held great influence over office policies.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas, who testified before the grand jury for two days in
March, said the report "simply lacked merit" and he "wholly
disagreed" with the majority of its 92 findings. He argued that
witnesses with information that might have countered the allegations
were never called to testify.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas defended his record, focusing on the drop in violent
crime and the dramatic improvement in child-support cases. He also
declared that office morale is good, saying reports to the contrary
have been propelled by "a small but vocal minority with their own
political and personal agenda."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas' arguments echo comments he made when the grand jury
report was released. Whenever a grand jury files a report about a
county agency, by law the agency must file a formal response within
30 days.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas, a former judge who was first elected as the county's
top prosecutor in 1998 and then again two years ago, continues to
blame the investigation on leftovers from the previous administration
who supported the campaign of former Deputy Dist. Atty. Wally Wade,
whom he faced in both elections.</TE>
<TE>   Wade said Monday that the grand jury is an experienced,
independent body with no political agendas. He took issue with
Rackauckas' spin of its conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   "What he's basically saying is that the grand jury violated its
oath, and that the attorney general of the state of California helped
them violate their oath," Wade said.</TE>

<LD>A survey of more than 100 Los Angeles-area Latino leaders released
Monday revealed that the majority are U.S.-born, college-educated and
earn a high income, unlike most Latino adults in Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   About 80% of the 123 respondents said they were born in the United
States, while a similar proportion of Latino adults in Los Angeles
County are foreign-born, according David Hayes-Bautista, a UCLA
professor who administered the survey. The findings were released by
the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount
University, United Way of Greater Los Angeles and UCLA's Center for
the Study of Latino Health and Culture.</LD>
<LD>   "We need to understand that we are not representative of the
average Latino adult," Hayes-Bautista told those assembled at the
Latino Leadership Summit at LMU on Monday. "We need to go that extra
mile to make sure we know what's going on in the community."</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An attorney for Robert Blake and his co-defendant, Earle S. Caldwell,
asked a judge Monday to delay until November a preliminary hearing in
the celebrity murder case.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys say they cannot prepare an adequate defense without more
time to read and analyze the 42,000 pages of evidence the prosecution
has produced since their clients were arrested April 18 in connection
with the shooting death of Blake's wife, Bonny Lee Bakley. The
defense received the latest installment--more than 7,000 pages--on
Aug. 19.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, prosecutors have asked Los Angeles County Superior
Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash to start the preliminary hearing within 10
days. Nash is expected to set a date today in Van Nuys.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't think they need a 90-day delay," said Sandi Gibbons, a
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office.
"They don't need every piece of evidence" to proceed with a
preliminary hearing, she said.</TE>

transform the force from an "aggressive command-and-control

<HD>First Day of Class Has Special Feel at Long-Awaited Cal
State Campus</HD>
<DH>Camarillo: Students and faculty alike share giddy pride at
opening of Channel Islands facility. Enrollment of 750 is projected
to eventually top 20,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't a bad way to start the school year.</LD>
<LD>   Students arriving Monday for the historic opening day at Cal State
Channel Islands found administrators swarming the halls, eager to
offer guidance. They found an assortment of snacks--popcorn, snow
cones and chips--available for free on the campus quad.</LD>
<LD>   And they were likely to find themselves face-to-face with
university President Richard Rush, who spent the morning dispensing
welcomes and chocolate silver dollars to members of Channel Islands'
inaugural class.</LD>
<TE>   "It's really awesome," said Ventura native Christine Rodrigues,
28, a biology major who transferred to the new university from Oxnard
College.</TE>
<TE>   Rodrigues and fellow student Nicole Manzano, both mothers with
1-year-old sons, created a child-care cooperative that turned out be
one of the first clubs on campus.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been hearing about this [creation of a Ventura County
campus] since high school," Rodrigues said. "It's such a big deal,
and I just think it's great to be part of it from the beginning."</TE>
<TE>   After more than 30 years of planning and preparation,
heartbreaking setbacks and heart-pounding successes, Ventura County's
first four-year public university opened its doors Monday, ushering
in its inaugural class of 750 students.</TE>
<TE>   The opening of the university, set in a series of renovated,
1930s-era buildings at the former Camarillo State Hospital,
culminates a decades-long dream to deliver a four-year college to a
region where generations of students have had no choice but to leave
if they wanted a state college degree.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, until Monday, Ventura County was the largest county in
California without a public four-year university.</TE>
<TE>   Boosters had cited that void as a stumbling block for local
students in their pursuit of four-year college degrees.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign to establish the campus took a major step forward in
1998, when CSU trustees endorsed a plan to convert the shuttered
state hospital into the 23rd campus in the Cal State University
system.</TE>
<TE>   By fall of the next year, a satellite campus of Cal State
Northridge had moved to the current Channel Islands site, providing
the seeds from which the new four-year campus would grow.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this a great day or what?" said Maria Tauber, who has had a
front-row seat for the evolution. She started working at the CSUN
off-campus center in 1997, and now is an administrator in the records
and registrar's office at Channel Islands.</TE>
<TE>   Tauber said it was hard to believe that opening day had finally
arrived.</TE>
<TE>   There were plenty of first-day jitters, even for some faculty
members.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Irina Costache ran into Rush in the hallway on the way
to teach her first class. "I'm ready and excited to be here," she
told him, showing up for class 45 minutes early.</TE>
<TE>   Launching the campus was just the first step in a long process
that will eventually see the addition of dormitories, sports teams
and the other trappings of an established school as it swells to more
than 20,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   Rush said the university this fall will face another review of its
academic plan as it moves toward accreditation. And already,
recruitment of more students for the fall semester is underway.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the matter of recruitment next year of the
university's first crop of freshmen, since the inaugural class at
Channel Islands is made up of only upper-division transfer students.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have all of our other deadlines to meet," Rush said.
"Really, it's only the beginning."</TE>

appeal of a court ruling that favored powerful Central Valley farming
interests.</LD>
<LD>   The Natural Resources Defense Council said the action, taken late
last week by the U.S. Department of the Interior, will likely result
in less water to support fish and more water flowing to growers in
Fresno and Kings counties.</LD>
<LD>   Further, the group warns that the move signals the
administration's intent to "abandon" the CalFed program, a joint
governmental effort to fairly distribute water to urban users,
wildlife and agriculture.</LD>
<TE>   "What looks on the face to be a very simple fight between
environmentalists and a bunch of farmers very rapidly now has
implications for the rest of the state," said Barry Nelson, an NRDC
policy analyst. "If the feds walk away from the CalFed program, they
are guaranteeing [more] litigation on a whole range of issues."</TE>
<TE>   The decision by the Department of Interior is a break from a
policy set under the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Department of the Interior and other water
agencies disagree with the NRDC, and say dropping the appeal won't
hurt fish. They add that it will eventually help streamline the way
the CalFed program operates.</TE>
<TE>   "Those that say it's a rollback or loss [for fish], well, I think
the facts will tell you something different," said Bennett W. Raley,
the Interior Department's assistant secretary for water and science.
"The failure to appeal doesn't change anything. We're redoing the
policy. Someone is crying wolf a little prematurely."</TE>
<TE>   Raley was referring to the policy that requires 800,000 acre-feet
of water to flow from Northern California rivers to the delta each
year, rather than be diverted into the extensive system that reroutes
water to farmers and cities.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the dispute is a complex set of rules determining
how the 800,000 acre-feet are counted.</TE>
<TE>   The Westlands Water District, in Fresno and Kings counties,
contended that the rules allowed well over the required amount to
flow to the delta--at the expense of farmers.</TE>
<TE>   The district sued and, in February, U.S. District Judge Oliver W.
Wanger ruled in its favor, determining that some of the water that
went to the delta wasn't being counted as part of the 800,000
acre-feet.</TE>
<TE>   The NRDC and the Interior Department appealed on the basis that
under the judge's ruling, water that was going to farmers would
actually be counted as going to the delta.</TE>
<TE>   The NRDC is still appealing the decision, but Raley said the
Interior Department will instead concentrate on rewriting the rules
to make them more equitable.</TE>
<TE>   "The judge's ruling doesn't in any way, shape or form provide a
basis for the department to do anything less than provide 800,000
acre-feet of water for the delta," said Raley.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have long held that keeping the San Francisco Bay
healthy depends on keeping a strong flow of fresh water running into
the bay through the delta.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, much of that water was diverted before it reached the
bay. As a result, salmon couldn't swim out to sea, wetlands went dry
and the bay's water quality dropped.</TE>
<TE>   The NRDC suspects that the revised rules will result in the bay's
receiving, at best, 60% to 70% of the amount needed.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson said that if the water allocated under the Interior
Department's revised rules isn't enough to sustain delta water
quality and the salmon, the deficit will have to be made up by other
users, quite possibly urban customers in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The main provider of water for much of the Los Angeles region--the
Metropolitan Water District--imported 1.3 million acre-feet of water
from Northern California last year.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy Quinn, a vice president with the MWD, said that Westlands
Water District has long been known as one of the most aggressive
districts in the state. But he doesn't think the Interior
Department's decision will jeopardize the CalFed program or any of
the water Southern California receives through the CalFed process.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't the end of the world; it's just one of 1,000 things we
have to adapt to," said Quinn. "The lawsuits are a mess. The fish are
recovering because of the CalFed process."</TE>

<HD>Bush Gone, but Feud Over Seats Lives On</HD>

<LD>President Bush left Santa Ana on Friday. But a dispute between Santa
Ana's police chief and a contingent from the Orange County Sheriff's
Department who wanted front-row seats for the president's visit
continued to simmer Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Some county sheriff's officials in the group said they were
threatened with arrest by Santa Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters if
they didn't give up their choice vantage point at the Bowers Museum.</LD>
<LD>   Walters reportedly told the group--including Assistant Sheriff
George Jaramillo; his wife, Lisa; Debbie Carona, wife of Sheriff Mike
Carona, and their son, Matthew; and sheriff's Lt. Wilfred Moreno--to
leave a roped-off area where Bush was scheduled to shake hands after
concluding his remarks.</LD>
<TE>   "He told everyone to get out of the area, that it was only for
VIPs," Moreno said Monday. "He warned them if they didn't get out, he
would get his guys and have them arrested. For Chief Walters to
handle the situation as he did, it was very insulting."</TE>
<TE>   Walters was on vacation Monday and attempts to reach him for
comment were unsuccessful. Santa Ana police officials said they were
unaware of any problems.</TE>
<TE>   Auto dealer Dennis Assael of Newport Beach said he also attended
the event with the Sheriff's Department group, whose members had been
invited by Mayor Miguel A. Pulido. They checked in as VIPs and staked
out spots at the Bowers for an hour before being approached by
Pulido's assistant, Jill Arthur, who told them to leave because the
area was reserved.</TE>
<TE>   When Jaramillo refused, Arthur came back with Walters. Jaramillo
and Moreno spoke separately with Walters, who again ordered the group
to leave, several group members said.</TE>
<TE>   "[Walters] said, 'If you don't move now, I'm going to throw you in
jail,' " Assael said.</TE>
<TE>   Pulido and Arthur declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Jaramillo said there were "problems created by Chief Paul
Walters.... We're handling these privately with Chief Walters and
Mayor Pulido, and we hope to be able to work it out," he said.</TE>

<HD>Post Office Launches Anti-Fraud Campaign</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Illegal telemarketing, which often uses the mail to collect money, is
bilking Americans out of $40 billion a year, sponsors of a new
anti-fraud campaign by the U.S. Postal Service said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Rolling out a series of television interviews and public service
announcements, postal inspectors said fraud complaints are up 27%
this year, reaching 68,000 nationwide. They plan to send 3 million
pieces of mail to senior citizens, who are often the intended victims
of the scams.</LD>
<LD>   Actress Betty White appeared on 18 television news shows from Los
Angeles on Monday to kick off the campaign. Her advice: "Hang up on
telemarketers rather than let yourself be pressured."</LD>
<TE>   Postal Inspector Pamela Prince warned that telephone solicitors
who promise a high rate of return with little risk should be viewed
with suspicion. Telemarketers also pretend to be an elderly person's
friend while urging them to mail them "deposits" or "taxes" on
lottery or other prizes, she said, payments that can run into the
thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   It is worth asking such callers for their telephone numbers and
warning them you wish to be taken off their list and never called
again, according to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   White said she finds it simpler to tell callers, "I never buy from
telemarketers" and hang up. Never give out any credit card, bank
account or Social Security numbers to anyone you don't know, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Many people are fooled into subscribing to magazines they don't
read in hopes of winning a prize, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Often, Prince said, the scams involve large amounts of stock. As
an example, she cited Sarita and Jose Spiwak of Los Angeles, who put
up $270,000 for stock purchases beginning in 1996 as a result of
telephone sales before becoming aware that the transactions were
suspect. Some stock purchases were made without their authorization.</TE>
<TE>   The postal inspector said the couple have recovered about $200,000
with help from lawyers and government prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Prince said information on antifraud tips can be obtained by
calling (877) 987-3728.</TE>

<HD>Creek Is Hopping With Frogs</HD>
<DH>Habitat: Biologist says more than 200 of rare red-legged
species may live near Santa Clarita.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California's largest population of red-legged frogs, a
threatened species that has found itself in the middle of legal
battles between environmentalists and homebuilders, may be living
along a creek north of Santa Clarita, federal biologists said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists originally estimated that 50 of the 5-inch-long
amphibians were living along San Francisquito Creek in the Angeles
National Forest. But after the 23,500-acre Copper Hill forest fire in
June--which cleared away brush in habitats previously inaccessible to
humans--biologists from the U.S. Geological Survey discovered 100
frogs there in one night.</LD>
<LD>   USGS biologist Robert Fisher estimated the total population in the
creek was "probably in excess of a couple of hundred."</LD>
<TE>   Environmentalists estimate that millions of red-legged frogs once
populated California. The largest frogs native to the western United
States, they were immortalized by Mark Twain's 1865 short story "The
Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County."</TE>
<TE>   But in recent decades, disappearing wetlands have decimated the
red-legged frog population.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher said the frogs along San Francisquito Creek may be the only
ones of their kind in Los Angeles County, which once had thousands of
them.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, the discovery of red-legged frogs on the site
of the proposed Ahmanson Ranch housing development has been a key
reason environmentalists have opposed the 3,050-home plan.</TE>
<TE>   Four frogs were found there in 1999, and the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service estimates 25 frogs live there now. The developer,
Washington Mutual Bank, is planning to break ground on the project
once a new study about how to protect the frog is approved by Ventura
County officials.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher said his team has begun working on a plan to repopulate
areas such as Ahmanson Ranch's with the newly found frogs from the
Angeles forest, but their work has been complicated by a fungus in
San Francisquito Creek that attacks tadpoles.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not sure if we can take the frogs from there and Johnny
Appleseed them all over the place, because we could be moving the
disease to other places," Fisher said. "It's a tenuous situation."</TE>
<TE>   The frogs face a number of other dangers in the creek. Nonnative
species introduced by humans, including crawfish and goldfish, have
been feasting on the tadpoles and frog eggs. And winter rains may
wash debris from the forest fire into the frogs' breeding ponds
downstream. As a precaution, Fisher said, biologists are building
artificial pools away from the main flow of the silt.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designated San
Francisquito Creek and 31 other California areas that may be home to
the red-legged frog as "critical habitats," a category of protected
land that limits or bars development and other uses to ensure the
survival of threatened or endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   The designation followed a lawsuit brought by environmental groups
that claimed the federal government wasn't adhering to its own
environmental guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   But homebuilder groups are currently challenging the existence of
29 of those areas, including Angeles National Forest. In a federal
lawsuit, they contend that the government did not properly gauge the
economic impact of the critical habitats, which cover 4.1 million
acres in 28 counties throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Campos, an attorney for one of the homebuilder associations
that brought the lawsuit, said he did not expect the new discovery of
red-legged frogs to have any bearing on the legal battle.</TE>

<HD>Dr. Arnold Gurevitch, 66; Dermatologist, Teacher</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Arnold W. Gurevitch, a dermatologist who worked with the indigent
and throughout a 40-year teaching career at UCLA and USC hospitals
advised the public on preventing and treating skin diseases, has died
at the age of 66.</LD>
<LD>   Gurevitch died July 15 in Los Angeles of anaplastic thyroid
cancer, USC officials announced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1996, Gurevitch had served as chief of dermatology at USC's
Keck School of Medicine and for County-USC Healthcare Network,
formerly General Hospital.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier, from 1969 until he moved to USC, Gurevitch had taught and
practiced at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   A respected teacher who trained hundreds of dermatologists,
Gurevitch was also known for working to secure additional medical
resources for the underprivileged.</TE>
<TE>   Along with his wife, Camille, Gurevitch also helped establish and
became a major supporter of the 27-year-old Community Magnet School
of Los Angeles. With his help, the school has pioneered multiracial
and multiethnic academic programs for an integrated student body.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Gurevitch was named the peer-recommended dermatologist
for Los Angeles in a national list of top doctors composed by the
Washington, D.C.-based Center for the Study of Services. The list was
compiled by asking physicians in some 50 major cities to name the
doctor in each specialty that they would choose to treat their own
families.</TE>
<TE>   Because of such widespread respect, Gurevitch was often consulted
by the news media and academic publications on skin care. His advice
was always pragmatic and down to earth.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1998 Times article on how often one should shower or bathe,
Gurevitch said, "You'll know when you're overdoing it. The skin will
become uncomfortably dry and scaly."</TE>
<TE>   As for California's beach bunnies, he warned in a recent issue of
USC Health Magazine that everyone should wear sunscreen with a
sun-protection factor of 15 to 30. But he added, "People think that
since they wear sunscreen, they can stay out in the sun all day. But
that's not the idea. No sunscreen is 100% effective."</TE>
<TE>   He also emphasized that advice in a 1999 article in the campus
newspaper, the Daily Trojan, warning about melanoma, a deadly type of
skin cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "One in every 75 live births today will most likely develop
melanoma," he said. "In the 1930s, it was one in every 1,500. Sun
damage is cumulative. Ultimately it will exceed a certain point and
can cause skin cancer "</TE>
<TE>   In an article about acne for the drkoop.com Web site in 1999,
Gurevitch assured sufferers that dirt was never the cause.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is, you simply couldn't clean your face enough to
prevent acne," he wrote. "Excessive cleansing and scrubbing is not
the answer. By their nature, acne treatments and medications are very
drying to the skin. So cleansing really has to be very gentle or the
skin can get chapped."</TE>
<TE>   The dermatologist even waded into the touchy debate on baldness or
hair loss, commenting on popular drugs advertised to counter the
problem. For a health newsletter published by USC Care Medical Group,
he warned:</TE>
<TE>   "For men and women using a 2% minoxidil formula, less than
one-third of the users respond to the treatment and a majority of
those responses are cessation of hair loss. Less than 10% of all the
users actually regrow hair.... They [the drugs] are really best for
younger people at the onset of hair loss. Once you have a shiny scalp
showing through, they're not going to work."</TE>
<TE>   A native of Los Angeles, Gurevitch earned his undergraduate degree
from Harvard and his medical degree at UCLA. He interned at what was
then Los Angeles County General Hospital and was a resident at Harbor
General and UCLA School of Medicine. After two years as a major in
the Army, serving at Ft. Ord and in Korea, he established his
practice and joined the faculty at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Gurevitch received the Harbor-UCLA Department of Medicine
Distinguished Teaching Award and UCLA's Victor D. Newcomer
Outstanding Clinical Teacher Award.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife; a son, Douglas; a daughter, Lara
Holtzman; a brother, Robert; and one grandson.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial program is scheduled at 4 p.m. Sept. 26 in Mayer
Auditorium at USC's Health Sciences Campus, 1975 Zonal Ave., Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that, instead of flowers, memorial donations
be sent to the Dr. Arnold W. Gurevitch Fund for Academic Dermatology,
2020 Zonal Ave., IRD 620, Los Angeles, CA 90033.</TE>

<HD>Assembly OKs Bill to Revert to June Primary Except for
Presidential Races</HD>
<DH>Politics: Legislation is approved that would let victims
sue criminals who profit from their crimes. And a committee kills a
measure to raise the smoking age to 21.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A measure to move state primary elections from March to June--but
keep the March date for presidential primaries--cleared the Assembly
on Monday despite opposition from elections officials and politicians
who said it would confuse voters.</LD>
<LD>   Also, in an effort to get around a court ruling that threw out the
state's "Son of Sam" law, the Assembly approved a measure that would
allow victims to sue criminals who profit by writing about their
crimes. And an Assembly committee killed legislation to raise the
smoking age from 18 to 21, possibly dealing the idea a death blow for
the time being, as legislators entered the final week of the
lawmaking year.</LD>
<LD>   The June primary bill, SB 1975 by Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine),
would move the statewide election back to early summer, where it was
before being bumped up to spring so Californians would have more say
in the selection of presidential candidates. Supporters say the later
primary would boost public participation and give challengers a
fairer shot against incumbents.</LD>
<TE>   Presidential primaries would still take place in March, however,
and in those years a second election for legislators would be held in
June--a situation that Republican and Democratic opponents said would
waste taxpayer money and possibly lead to even lower turnouts.</TE>
<TE>   "When you talk about depressed turnouts, it might have something
to do with us changing elections every two years," said Assemblyman
Rod Pacheco (R-Riverside).</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the measure passed the Assembly on a 41-13 vote, with
support from an unusual mix of Republicans and Democrats. It now
heads back to the Senate for final approval.</TE>
<TE>   The Son of Sam bill, SB 1887 by Sen. Bruce McPherson (R-Santa
Cruz), comes in response to a California Supreme Court ruling
invalidating a 1983 state law that prohibited criminals from
profiting from their crimes by selling their stories.</TE>
<TE>   The measure seeks to sidestep the ruling by allowing victims to
sue for the profits and in essence achieve the same result. It passed
59 to 0 and now goes back to the Senate for final passage.</TE>
<TE>   The smoking-age legislation, SB 1680 by Sen. Richard Polanco
(D-Los Angeles), died when Polanco tabled it in the Assembly
Governmental Organization Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco's measure had initially been about law enforcement, not
smoking, but Pacheco, the GOP assemblyman, succeeded in inserting
amendments on the Assembly floor that turned it into a bill to raise
the smoking age from 18 to 21.</TE>
<TE>   In other action:</TE>
<TE>   * Organized labor added another victory to its string of
legislative wins when the Senate approved a bill that would require
employers to provide severance pay to workers who lose their jobs
because of layoffs, closure of the business or relocation to another
site.</TE>
<TE>   AB 2989 is sponsored by the California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO,
which argued that it would provide some parity to workers who are
laid off amid a company's collapse while superiors walk away with
rich severance packages.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation would apply to commercial and industrial employers
of 100 or more workers. It cleared the Senate by a thin margin on a
21-14 vote, and now returns to the Assembly for adoption of changes
made in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   * The Senate approved a bill that would require retailers to post
a sign to alert the public that certain unpackaged fish and shellfish
were the products of genetic alteration.</TE>
<TE>   The creatures, known as transgenic fish and cell fish, are not
available in American grocery stores and fish markets. But the Food
and Drug Administration is considering approving their sale in the
United States. Environmentalists fear the fish may carry harmful new
toxins and diseases and argue that consumers should be alerted.</TE>
<TE>   AB 791 by Assemblywoman Virginia Strom-Martin (D-Duncans Mills)
passed on a 22-14 vote. It now returns to the Assembly for final
consideration.</TE>
<TE>   * The Assembly killed legislation that would have prevented
insurance companies from getting into the auto body business, as
opponents argued that insurers can't be any worse than auto body
shops at respecting consumers' interests.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents argued that insurance companies could not be trusted to
ensure consumers got the best parts possible if they also owned auto
body shops. But opponents said auto body shops were already notorious
for not acting in good faith, and should not be shielded from
competition.</TE>
<TE>   The measure, SB 1648 by Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough) failed
badly, garnering only 24 of the 41 votes needed for passage.</TE>
<TE>   "This group that has built this abysmal record is acting for
special protection," Assemblyman Dario Frommer (D-Los Feliz) said of
the auto shops. "That is wrong."</TE>

<LD>The police log of the Huntington Beach News reported that a man found
sleeping on someone else's front porch at 3 a.m. "said he was looking
for his cat." Maybe the catnap was part of his strategy.</LD>

<LD>   All wet: A man accused of trafficking in pornography in Redondo
Beach jumped into the ocean and began to swim out to sea when
officers approached. We'll never know whether he could have made it
to Catalina. The Beach Reporter newspaper said he was resting on a
buoy when a lifeguard boat netted him.</LD>

<TE>   We'll always have Century City: Harry's Bar and American Grill,
one of the promoters of the International Imitation Hemingway

<TE>   But at least its participants left us several moving memories of
Century City, including this one from Ken Bash's "Big Too-Hardened
Liver":</TE>
<TE>   "It was early morning and the sun was bright and painful and
rising on the tall glass towers when the rocket exploded to announce
the release of the bulls and we all rushed out to see the big, brave,
mature and viciously horny bulls toss the TV executives as they came
up the escalators."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some food for thought (if you dare): The L.A. branch of
Chowhound.com, a Web site "for those who live to eat," held a
chat-room discussion on "food confessions you'd rather not make."
Some of the secret passions that were revealed:</TE>
<TE>   * "I don't think this is such a bad thing, but my fiance thinks
it's pretty gross: tomatoes sprinkled with sugar."</TE>
<TE>   * "Grilled peanut butter and jelly, slathered in butter and
grilled like a cheese sandwich."</TE>
<TE>   * "Kraft macaroni and cheese with green peas mixed."</TE>
<TE>   * "Toasted bread with almond butter, mayo and bacon."</TE>
<TE>   * "My 90-year-old grandmother turned me on to this one. It's toast
with peanut butter, dried shredded pork and pickled radishes (wu ling
tsai) on toast."</TE>
<TE>   * "Mayonnaise sandwiches with Best Foods (a lot too) on soft white
bread with crusts cut off."</TE>
<TE>   One reader had no favorite, just this comment:</TE>
<TE>   "I just read this entire thread, and I'm not dissin' anyone, but I
lost my appetite for lunch."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Come on, now, haven't we all felt like doing this at

<HD>Emily Genauer, 91; Art Critic Awarded Pulitzer Prize in
1974</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Emily Genauer, 91, a Pulitzer Prize-winning art critic who
familiarized newspaper readers with modern artists including Marc
Chagall and Diego Rivera, died Friday in New York after a long
illness.</LD>
<LD>   Born on Staten Island, N.Y., Genauer was educated at Hunter
College and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.</LD>
<LD>   She began her newspaper career with the New York World in 1929 and
remained for 20 years with what became the World-Telegram. Genauer
left abruptly in 1949 when the newspaper's owner, Roy W. Howard,
criticized her praise of artists he considered "Communists and
left-wingers."</LD>
<TE>   Intent on promoting lesser-known and 20th-century artists, Genauer
was chief art critic for the New York Herald Tribune from 1949 to
1966. After the Tribune merged with two papers to become the New York
World Journal Tribune, she stayed until its end in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   Genauer capped her long career with a final decade as a columnist
for the Newsday Syndicate. In 1974, she earned the Pulitzer Prize for
criticism for her work on art and artists for the syndicate.</TE>

<HD>Jury Dismisses Allegations of Racial Profiling</HD>
<DH>Lawsuit: After seven hours of deliberation, jurors find
that LAPD officers did not act improperly during a 1999 traffic stop.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal jury found Monday that Los Angeles police officers acted
properly when they ordered three black motorists, including a
Virginia judge, out of their car and forced them to lie face down in
the street following a traffic stop in Venice.</LD>
<LD>   After seven hours of deliberations, the 12-member jury dismissed
allegations that the LAPD officers engaged in racial profiling,
applied excessive force and conducted an illegal search. The vote was
unanimous.</LD>
<LD>   The plaintiffs were Alotha C. Willis, a juvenile and domestic
relations court judge from Portsmouth, Va.; her husband, Wayne
Person, a civilian contract manager for the Navy; and Sheryl Crayton,
assistant principal at a Carson middle school. They sued 10 police
officers involved in the July 3, 1999, incident, along with top
department officials.</LD>
<TE>   All three declined to comment as they left the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   "The jury did the right thing," said Assistant City Atty. Don
Vincent. "They vindicated our officers, all of whom acted properly."</TE>
<TE>   The "high-risk felony prone" takedown, the focus of the lawsuit,
grew out a run-of-the-mill traffic violation in the middle of the
afternoon at a busy intersection.</TE>
<TE>   Officers Luis Navarette and Manuel Ibarra, working together for
the first time, testified that they saw Crayton's red Volvo sedan
make an illegal right turn.</TE>
<TE>   Navarette said that when he ran a computer check on the car's
license plate, he was advised that it belonged to another vehicle. He
said he and his partner thought the Volvo might have been stolen or
been fitted with stolen plates by someone planning to commit a crime.</TE>
<TE>   The officers radioed for backup, including a police helicopter,
and pulled Crayton's car over several blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, each occupant was ordered at gunpoint to get out of
the car and lie face down on the asphalt, where they were handcuffed.</TE>
<TE>   After five to 10 minutes on the ground, they were helped to their
feet, ushered over to a sidewalk and frisked. Several minutes elapsed
before a sergeant approached and ordered their handcuffs removed. The
Department of Motor Vehicles made a mistake, he told them. The agency
had sent Crayton a set of plates intended for another motorist.</TE>
<TE>   In his closing arguments to the jury, civil rights lawyer Stephen
Yagman argued that Navarette and Ibarra decided to stop the car
before they had even run the Volvo's plates. All they knew at the
time, he said, was that the occupants were black.</TE>
<TE>   But two jurors interviewed after the verdict rejected that claim.
Jurors Mark Acosta and Dennis Breckenridge said they listened to
police radio tapes that showed the officers called for backup a full
minute after being advised that the plates did not belong to the
Volvo.</TE>
<TE>   "The crux of the plaintiffs' case was that the two officers
entered into a conspiracy to stop them because they were black,"
Acosta said. "There was just no evidence of that, plain and simple."</TE>
<TE>   During the 13-day trial, Yagman subpoenaed former police chiefs
Daryl F. Gates and Bernard C. Parks, Interim Chief Martin Pomeroy, 12
current and former members of the civilian police commission, and two
inspectors general in an attempt to support the claim that the
department has tolerated racial profiling for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Acosta and Breckenridge said the jury did not deliberate on that
issue. They did not have to once they found the officers were not
liable.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the officers named in the suit were in attendance when
U.S. District Judge Christina A. Snyder read the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Tom Burris, the highest ranking officer among the defendants,
said he was proud of their conduct and gratified by the jury's
verdict. "Believe me," he said. "It was no fun sitting in court and
hearing someone call you a bunch of Nazi storm troopers."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Brea police Monday described an object found on a city sidewalk over
the weekend as a makeshift bomb that could have seriously injured or
killed someone.</LD>
<LD>   "It was similar to a pipe bomb, about 6 inches in length," Lt.
Martin Needham said. "It had destructive capabilities."</LD>
<LD>   A jogger found the device about 8 a.m. Sunday in the 1200 block of
West Lambert Road.</LD>
<TE>   Police evacuated people from a nearby Mobil gas station and
Calvary Chapel Church for two hours while the sheriff's bomb squad
used a robot to defuse the device.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't close enough to any people or businesses to make us
think that someone was being targeted," Needham said. "It could have
been inadvertently left there or thrown out of a car."</TE>

<LD>The penalty phase started Monday in the trial of a man convicted of a
shooting rampage at an Anaheim hospital, with testimony from
relatives of the three victims.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll never understand why this happened," said Kirk Premo, 32,
son of West Anaheim Medical Center nursing assistant Marlene
Mustaffa, the first person Dung D. Trinh shot on Sept. 14, 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Mustaffa's husband, Dave, said she "was a very beautiful woman,
very gentle [and] always had something nice to say. She just had a
way about her that people loved her."</LD>

<LD>A group of landowners, eager to build homes in an area that lacks
water supply, has offered to pay extra taxes to help Cambria draw up
a plan to address the city's water shortage.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives of United Lot Owners of Cambria offered to form a
district comprising about 1,000 lots so that members would pay a
special tax. The group offered to pay about $2.5 million over a
decade to help the city complete its water master plan. In its plan,
the Community Services District has considered desalting ocean water
and installing a reservoir.</LD>

<LD>Petaluma City Councilman Bryant Moynihan wants his community to
double spending on battered streets that are ranked among the worst
in the San Francisco Bay Area.</LD>
<LD>   Critics of the city's pavement repair efforts have painted rings
around potholes, staged protests, and printed bumper stickers with
tongue-in-cheek slogans such as "Got Potholes?"</LD>
<LD>   City officials estimate that it would cost $146 million to repair
the 150-mile network of streets and $8.1 million a year for
maintenance. The city is currently spending less than half that.</LD>

<LD>Mill Valley's original Andrew Carnegie library, built almost a
century ago for perhaps $6,000, is selling for the very up-to-date
price of $3.25 million. The 1911 building was remodeled in the early
1970s into a 4,500-square-foot home. The downtown brick building
comes complete with authentic bits of the past in a contemporary
setting.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Frederiksen bought the old library in 1984 and owns it with
his wife, Tara Crawford. "It definitely has the feel of an old
library," she said. "We have had a lot of people try to return books
here over the years."</LD>

<HD>Legislature OKs Bill on Incapacitated Patients</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Legislature gave its final approval Monday to a bill that would
give researchers more leeway to enroll incapacitated patients in
research studies.</LD>
<LD>   The bill would allow family members to approve participation by
patients unable to give their consent. Such patients might include
victims of stroke or Alzheimer's disease or those in comas.</LD>
<LD>   The University of California and several health groups strongly
support the bill, which now heads to the desk of Gov. Gray Davis.
They contend that more flexibility is needed to improve treatment of
life-threatening diseases and injuries.</LD>
<TE>   Supporters of the bill have said current laws governing informed
consent are open to interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law allows any "legally appointed representative" to give
consent on behalf of an incapacitated patient, leaving interpretation
of that term to individual states. California law is more
restrictive, giving authority only to those appointed by the courts
or legally approved by the patients before incapacitation.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the bill said it could place patients at risk for
exploitation. Several studies have shown that family members and
doctors are poor predictors of what treatments patients want.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, some opponents say that the UC system doesn't deserve
this new authority because of its previous lapses in protecting human
research subjects.</TE>
<TE>   In response to critics, the bill's authors amended their proposal
to ban payments to family members who volunteer patients for
research.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Dion Aroner (D-Berkeley), who co-authored the bill,
said she's satisfied with the end product.</TE>

<HD>William Warfield, 82; Baritone Found Success on Stage,
Screen</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>William Warfield, the esteemed American baritone who sang "Ol' Man
River" in the 1951 MGM film version of Jerome Kern's "Show Boat," has
died. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Warfield died Sunday at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago
where he had been recuperating from a fall late last month, according
to his brother, Thaddeus Warfield. An autopsy will be performed.</LD>
<LD>   Possessed of a warm, honeyed baritone capable of great dramatic
urgency, Warfield made the parts of Joe the dockhand in "Show Boat"
and Porgy in George Gershwin's "Porgy and Bess" virtual signature
roles in a long career that continued until this July when he sang a
recital at Harvard University.</LD>
<TE>   The oldest of a Baptist preacher's five sons, Warfield was born in
West Helena, Ark., on Jan. 22, 1920. Seeking better educational and
employment opportunities, his father, Robert E. Warfield, soon moved
the family to Rochester, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   During Warfield's senior year in high school, he won top honors at
both the regional and national finals of the National Music Educators
League Competition.</TE>
<TE>   With a first-place award of a scholarship to the American music
school of his choice in hand, Warfield entered the Eastman School of
Music of the University of Rochester, where he earned his bachelor's
in 1942. After four years in the Army's military intelligence
division during World War II, he returned to Eastman for a master's.</TE>
<TE>   Warfield originally planned to become a music teacher, not a
singer. But, encouraged by groundbreaking African American vocal
artists, contralto Marian Anderson and bass Paul Robeson, he began
focusing on his vocal and dramatic training. He sang in the national
touring company of Harold Rome's 1947 Broadway musical "Call Me
Mister," then two years later went on to create the role of Cal in
the original Broadway cast of Marc Blitzstein's opera "Regina."</TE>
<TE>   He made his Town Hall recital debut in 1950, receiving critical
raves that propelled his career forward as a concert singer. For
major opera careers, African American singers had to wait until 1955
when Anderson broke the color barrier at the Metropolitan in New
York. By that time, however, Warfield's oratorio and stage career was
soaring.</TE>
<TE>   In 1952, he was signed to sing Porgy opposite soprano Leontyne
Price's Bess in a European tour sponsored by the U.S. State
Department. The two married in 1952, but separated six years later
and, citing the demands of disparate careers, divorced in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1950s, Warfield recorded frequently, toured as a
soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra and appeared as De Lawd on
NBC's Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation of Marc Connelly's "Green
Pastures." He gave the world premiere of the second set of Copland's
"Old American Songs," with the composer as pianist, in 1953.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s and '70s, Warfield revived his signature roles in
"Show Boat" and "Porgy and Bess" in New York, Vienna, Puerto Rico,
Athens, Geneva and other cities.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, he was appointed a professor of music at the University
of Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   He also received honorary doctorates from the University of
Arkansas in 1972, Lafayette College in 1977, Boston University in
1982, Augustana College in 1983 and James Milliken University in
1984. He became a professor at Northwestern University in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, he also won a Grammy in the spoken word category for his
narration of Copland's "A Lincoln Portrait," a role he performed
often and reprised in 2001 at the Hollywood Bowl with conductor John
Mauceri and the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   Warfield had also been prominent in the Pacific Symphony's
eight-day Copland Centenary Festival in Costa Mesa in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   He was president of the National Assn. of Negro Musicians from
1985 to 1990 and published his memoirs, "William Warfield: My Music &amp;
My Life," in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by two brothers.</TE>

<HD>Water Districts Sweeten Offer to Imperial Valley</HD>
<DH>Resources: Farmers are unimpressed by new terms for the
sale of some of their supply. Deal would help the state avoid losing
part of its river allocation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In hopes of saving a deal considered key to preventing a drastic
reduction in Southern California's supply of Colorado River water,
two urban water districts have offered what they say are
significantly improved terms for the Imperial Valley to sell water to
thirsty San Diego County.</LD>
<LD>   But reaction Monday from officials of the rural Imperial
Irrigation District was decidedly lukewarm.</LD>
<LD>   Andy Horne, an Imperial official involved in daylong negotiating
sessions in Sacramento, said the deal offered by the San Diego County
Water Authority and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California does not address the major concerns of farmers and others
in the Imperial Valley about leaving farmland fallow and protecting
the Salton Sea.</LD>
<TE>   Horne said the deal appears to require fallowing more land than
farmers want and fails to protect the district from an enormous bill
for environmental restoration of the Salton Sea.</TE>
<TE>   "We just don't see this as very responsive," Horne said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the San Diego, Imperial Valley and Metropolitan
districts met privately for most of Monday, along with officials from
the Coachella Valley Water District. Legislators and officials from
several state agencies also attended.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Mary Nichols, state resources director, called the
session, which began Sunday night, "a cordial discussion" and said
negotiations may continue today.</TE>
<TE>   By Dec. 31, the state must devise a plan to use less Colorado
River water or face a mandatory cutback by the Department of the
Interior. The San Diego-Imperial deal is seen as key to the state's
plans for a voluntary reduction.</TE>
<TE>   If the Department of the Interior makes good on its threat,
Southern California could lose up to 800,000 acre-feet of water a
year, enough to supply 1.6 million families.</TE>
<TE>   For years the rapidly growing coastal region has been using
"surplus" water that belongs to other states; now those states want
California to live within its allocation. By historic rights, the
Imperial district controls nearly 75% of the state's entitlement to
the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is taking the Department of the Interior seriously,"
said Adan Ortega, an official with the Metropolitan Water District,
which provides water to six Southern California counties. "If we
don't come to terms, we expect them to follow through."</TE>
<TE>   With the Legislature set to adjourn later this week, a sense of
urgency has taken over what is often the languid pace of negotiations
over water matters.</TE>
<TE>   As early as today, an Assembly committee will hear a bill by State
Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica) meant to aid the San
Diego-Imperial deal. The bill would limit the amount the Imperial
Valley district might have to pay to offset damage done to the Salton
Sea by the transfer.</TE>
<TE>   Because the sea is sustained by farm runoff, any reduction in
water use in the Imperial Valley could increase the salinity of the
sea, potentially killing birds and fish. Under state and federal law,
the Imperial Irrigation District could be held responsible for
damaging the sea, a liability that could total hundreds of millions
of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The governing board of the Imperial district, one of the nation's
largest agricultural irrigation districts, is set to meet Thursday in
El Centro to discuss the San Diego and MWD proposal.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego would pay $130 million to the Imperial Irrigation
District at the beginning of the 75-year contract. Also, farmers
would not need to fallow land for five years because the water for
San Diego in those years would come from water being sold to
Metropolitan by the Palo Verde Irrigation District in Blythe.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego officials said this would give Imperial Valley officials
five years to prepare for the economic impact of letting a portion of
their fields go dry. Starting in year six, Imperial Valley would be
required to fallow land for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Horne said the offer is unacceptable because it merely moves money
from the latter years of the contract to the first year. Also, the
duration of fallowing is longer than farmers will accept, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, the Imperial Irrigation District offered to drop
its adamant opposition to fallowing, but only for five years while
water conservation devices are installed on farms.</TE>
<TE>   "The Valley is not going to bankrupt itself for this deal," Horne
said.</TE>

<HD>Spain Issues 3-Year Ban on Basque Political Party</HD>
<DH>Separatism: Suspension by judge comes as parliament seeks
to outlaw Batasuna.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>MADRID</DL>
<LD>Masked Spanish police stormed the headquarters of Basque nationalist
party Batasuna on Monday night after the lower house of parliament
and a senior judge launched a two-pronged attack to ban the group,
which is accused of links to the outlawed separatist group ETA.</LD>
<LD>   State radio said police shut down Batasuna's main office in
Pamplona, fulfilling an order from Judge Baltasar Garzon, the
investigating magistrate who slapped a three-year ban on the party
for funding and supporting one of Europe's last guerrilla forces.</LD>
<LD>   "Democracy in the Basque homeland!" shouted several Batasuna
members, including regional legislators and town councilors, as
police ejected them from the building. Despite the ban on the party,
they will be allowed to serve out their terms in local and regional
government.</LD>
<TE>   The judge's ruling came the same day that the lower house of
parliament overwhelmingly approved a government proposal to petition
the Supreme Court to outlaw Batasuna permanently.</TE>
<TE>   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed more
than 800 people since 1968 in its campaign for a Basque homeland.</TE>
<TE>   Batasuna's leaders deny Madrid's charges that they are the
political wing of ETA.</TE>
<TE>   They say their party could act as an intermediary with the armed
group in negotiations with the government to end the dispute in the
Basque Country.</TE>

<LD>The war crimes trial of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
resumed after a month's recess with a man's testimony that he saw
Serbian troops gun down at least 39 ethnic Albanians.</LD>
<LD>   Sadik Xhemajli told the court in The Hague that he watched with
binoculars from a nearby hill as Serbian soldiers separated 127 men
from a group of unarmed civilians in a field near the Kosovo village
of Izbica on March 28, 1999. Some were shot, while the crippled and
elderly were burned alive, he said.</LD>

<LD>A Philippine court ordered a freeze on all assets of ousted President
Joseph Estrada and his co-defendants in a $76-million corruption
case.</LD>
<LD>   The court also ordered a freeze on assets of Jose Velarde, a name
prosecutors say Estrada used as an alias to hide millions of dollars
in bribes, as well as two houses owned by Estrada's co-defendants,
Charlie "Atong" Ang and Yolanda Ricaforte. Ang, who lives in Nevada,
has been fighting extradition efforts by the Philippines.</LD>
<LD>   Estrada, forced to step down in January 2001, is accused of
illegally acquiring funds and properties while president. He has
denied wrongdoing.</LD>

<HD>Hussein Is Called 'Mortal Threat'</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Cheney tells veterans group that Iraqi leader will
have nuclear bomb 'fairly soon.' Bush lawyers decide president can
launch attack at will.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vice President Dick Cheney on Monday spelled out the Bush
administration's rationale for ousting Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, saying he believes that the dictator will add the nuclear
bomb "fairly soon" to his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   Cheney's remarks injected a heightened sense of determination and
urgency into President Bush's desire to launch a preemptive strike
against Baghdad despite cautions from critics both at home and
abroad--including from some top Republicans in the first Bush
administration--that the White House should go slow in dealing with
Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   "What we must not do in the face of a mortal threat is to give in
to wishful thinking or willful blindness," he told the national
convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Nashville. "We will not
simply look away, hope for the best, and leave the matter for some
future administration to resolve."</LD>
<TE>   The vice president called the arguments of administration critics
"deeply flawed."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's comments came as the president's lawyers concluded that
he can launch a military strike against Iraq without new approval
from Congress.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials at President Bush's ranch near Crawford,
Texas, discussed that finding even as they hastened to add that Bush
would consult broadly with lawmakers and allies before acting.</TE>
<TE>   Still, officials left little doubt that the president is reserving
the option of going it alone.</TE>
<TE>   "We will also demonstrate leadership," said White House Press
Secretary Ari Fleischer. "It's often the case that when America
leads, the world follows."</TE>
<TE>   In a briefing in Texas, Fleischer also noted that President
Clinton asserted similar authority in 1999 when he launched bombing
missions in Kosovo.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Fleischer said, Bush would act only after considering
other factors. "There are a host of other issues that the president
will consider--including policy matters, historical matters,
relationship with Congress matters, public support matters."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats disputed the White House claim that Bush is not
legally bound to seek congressional approval for a military strike
against Iraq. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy
(D-Vt.) said the decision to go to war "should not be treated like a
technicality."'</TE>
<TE>   But House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas) said that, although he
believed that Bush would consult Congress before taking military
action against Iraq, he thought requiring him to seek authorization
amounted to throwing up "hypothetical hurdles for the president to
jump over as he's leading us against the terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Although Fleischer reiterated Bush's oft-stated position that no
decision on Iraq has been made--and that there is no specific
timetable for action--Cheney in Tennessee repeated Bush's comment
that "time is not on our side" in dealing with Hussein, whom the vice
president called a "sworn enemy" of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has accused Hussein of trying to assassinate former
President Bush. Cheney said the Iraqi leader had repeatedly deceived
United Nations weapons inspectors dispatched to Iraq after the 1991
Persian Gulf War--fought to end Baghdad's occupation of Kuwait--to
monitor his compliance with promises to stop developing weapons of
mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past decade, Saddam has systematically broken each of
these agreements," Cheney said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, he said, "we now know that Saddam has resumed his
efforts to acquire nuclear weapons."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney then added: "Many of us are convinced that Saddam Hussein
will acquire nuclear weapons fairly soon. Just how soon, we cannot
really gauge."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence officials agree that assessing the time frame
Iraq needs to develop and build a nuclear weapon is a matter of
considerable conjecture.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. inspection and disarmament teams were ejected by Iraq in
1998, but U.N. sanctions and prohibitions remain in place, designed
to hinder Iraq's ability to import the materials and machinery needed
to rebuild research and production facilities.</TE>
<TE>   If the U.N. sanctions were someday removed, "the intelligence
community estimates that Iraq, unconstrained, would take several
years to produce enough fissile material to make a weapon," says the
most recent unclassified National Intelligence Estimate, which was
released in January of this year and includes the judgments of the
CIA and other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   That conclusion is still valid unless the Iraqi dictator "buys a
bomb off the shelf somewhere," an intelligence official said Monday.
No evidence suggests that he has, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, government officials and outside experts noted,
Hussein is several years away from possessing a long-range missile to
deliver a nuclear weapon to distant targets.</TE>
<TE>   But Cheney said the West has underestimated Hussein's capabilities
before. Prior to the Gulf War, intelligence officials believed that
Hussein was "at least five or perhaps even 10 years away from having
a nuclear weapon," the vice president said.</TE>
<TE>   But after the war, officials discovered that Iraq was "perhaps
within a year of acquiring such a weapon," Cheney said.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney also raised the specter that even if Iraq were to readmit
the U.N. inspectors, that act alone might not avert a U.S. military
strike.</TE>
<TE>   "On the contrary, there is a great danger that it would provide
false comfort that Saddam was somehow back in his box," Cheney said.
"Meanwhile, he would continue to plot."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's low-key, monotone speaking style belied the stark message
he delivered--in words that seemed to defy skepticism.</TE>
<TE>   "Ladies and gentlemen, there is no basis in Saddam Hussein's
conduct or history to discount any of the concerns that I'm raising
this morning," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Several times during his speech, Cheney quoted from Bush's own
remarks, saying at one point: "The risks of inaction are far greater
than the risk of action....</TE>
<TE>   "And the entire world must know that we will take whatever action
is necessary to defend our freedom and our security....This nation
will not live at the mercy of terrorists or terror regimes."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney called "deeply flawed" the argument that, until Hussein has
actually acquired a nuclear weapon, it would be premature for the
U.S. to act.</TE>
<TE>   "Yet, if we did wait until that moment, Saddam would simply be
emboldened, and it would become even harder for us to gather friends
and allies to oppose him."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney also argued that a "regime change" in Baghdad would not
destabilize the region.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the opposite is true," he said, adding, "When the
gravest of threats are eliminated, the freedom-loving peoples of the
region will have a chance to promote the values that can bring
lasting peace."</TE>
<TE>   And he quoted a Middle East expert as having predicted that the
streets of Baghdad and other Iraqi cities would "erupt in joy" after
Hussein is ousted.</TE>
<TE>   "Our ability to advance the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
would be enhanced, just as it was following the liberation of Kuwait
in 1991," Cheney said. "The reality is that these times bring not
only dangers but also opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney also noted that the U.S. has a long history of helping
rebuild vanquished foes, and said, "We would act in that same spirit
after a regime change in Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   The goal, he said, would be to help Iraq develop "a government
that is democratic and pluralistic [and become] a nation where the
human rights of every ethnic and religious group are recognized and
protected."</TE>

<HD>New Phase in Mideast Bloodshed</HD>
<DH>Intifada: For the first time, a Palestinian woman accused
of informing is killed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TULKARM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Only God and the Israelis know for sure if Ikhlas Khouli, a widowed
Palestinian mother of seven, was guilty of collaborating with Israel,
say residents of this dusty town.</LD>
<LD>   But most have their suspicions.</LD>
<LD>   Two days after members of the militant Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade
pumped her body full of bullets and left it in the town square to
serve as a deterrent, neighbors, the town mosque, even other
relatives had turned against Khouli and her survivors.</LD>
<TE>   Collaboration is just about the worst crime imaginable in this
community, residents say. Amid charges that Khouli passed on
information that led to the death of militia leader Ziad Mohammed
Daas at the hands of an Israeli sniper Aug. 7, her children are
having trouble finding a place to bury her.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of men have been executed as collaborators by Palestinian
militants since the intifada started 23 months ago. Khouli, however,
is the first reported female informant. Much like the recent advent
of female suicide bombers, her death has opened another grisly
chapter in Mideast bloodletting.</TE>
<TE>   Khouli's eldest son, Bakir, 17, sits on a chair in their one-room
house fidgeting as he considers a terrible question: Did his words
seal his mother's fate?</TE>
<TE>   The men from Al Aqsa came for him, and their interrogation was so
terrifying, he says, that he can't remember everything he told them.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have told them I owned East Jerusalem to end the pain,"
he adds, lifting a worn yellow T-shirt to show several scars on his
skinny back, some large, some small, all fresh.</TE>
<TE>   Bakir refuses to answer the militia's charges that he gave his
mother information on where Daas was hiding and that she then passed
it on to her brother in Israel, who has been labeled "a known
collaborator."</TE>
<TE>   In the company of his sisters and a niece, Bakir recounts his
memories for the umpteenth time. How three unarmed brigade members
he'd never seen arrived at their door Friday afternoon at 3:30,
blindfolded him and took him by car to a nearby refugee camp. How
they beat him with electric wires that ripped his skin, drew blood
and filled his brain with an unearthly pain.</TE>
<TE>   After the men finished questioning him around 9:30 that evening,
they took him back to the family's house to get his mother. She
initially refused to go with them but was eventually persuaded. After
the two were taken back to the camp, Bakir says, he caught only a
glimpse of her again because they were placed in different rooms. The
next afternoon, he was released.</TE>
<TE>   "Your mother is dead," one of the men told him, without any
explanation.</TE>
<TE>   An amateur videotape reportedly taken by Al Aqsa and played on
Israeli evening news programs shows Khouli confessing. She wears a
yellow Islamic head scarf and glasses and sits before an upturned
mattress saying she passed on information about Daas to her brother
living in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "Was your confession coerced?" asks an unknown voice.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Khouli responds, looking frightened.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you have anything to tell Palestinians?" she is asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to tell all boys and girls, young and old, that even
if it means death, do not collaborate," she replies.</TE>
<TE>   Tulkarm Gov. Izzedine Sharif says he's concerned that outsiders
will use the incident to smear Palestinians and Tulkarm. He says that
everyone is entitled to a trial and that he disapproves of anyone who
takes justice into his or her own hands.</TE>
<TE>   But Israel must also bear blame for Khouli's death, he adds,
because the curfew and occupation have prevented Palestinian police
from protecting Tulkarm's citizens or otherwise doing their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though Israel was in control of the city when this happened,
they drove her to the camp and interrogated her," he says as he sits
at his desk beneath a large picture of Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat. "Israel only thinks about its own security,
not the security of Palestinians."</TE>
<TE>   At the Khouli house a few blocks from the governor's office, two
orphaned daughters, a niece and a friend sit against a nicked plaster
wall, their looks of resignation mixed with tears. The room has
little more than a cupboard and several foam mattresses.</TE>
<TE>   "All of society seems to be turning against us now," says Najla
Khouli, 18, the eldest of Khouli's children. "Even our grandmother
won't talk to us," she adds, dabbing her eyes with a paper napkin.</TE>
<TE>   She hasn't seen the tape of their mother's confession but believes
it must have been coerced. Even if her mother was a collaborator, she
adds, which she wasn't, they could have shot her legs or done
something other than kill her.</TE>
<TE>   Callers identifying themselves as members of the Al Aqsa militia
claimed responsibility for the execution in calls to Reuters and
Associated Press shortly after Khouli's body was dumped next to a
disfigured monument plastered with posters of so-called "martyrs" and
children killed in the intifada.</TE>
<TE>   Tulkarm residents said Monday that they thought it was natural for
family members to deny having collaborators in their midst given the
stigma they could expect for years, if not generations.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that stays with families forever," said Kader
Nofel, 23, a clerk in a shop a few feet from the square. "Even
killing her in that way was small punishment. This is the worst crime
imaginable, lower than animals."</TE>
<TE>   Several Tulkarm residents said they believed the circumstantial
evidence against Khouli, even if they were uneasy about torture or
execution without a trial. The evidence included her brother's living
in Israel as a known collaborator, they claimed, and the fact that
she was often seen walking or meeting with strangers, actions viewed
under Islamic tradition as improper for a woman.</TE>
<TE>   "I might have some reservations because she had kids," said Maysa
Bodran, 35, a woman working in a pharmacy a few steps from the Khouli
house. "But traitors deserve what they get. She should have thought
of her kids and family before she got involved with the Israelis."</TE>
<TE>   Several residents said tough measures are essential in the current
political environment.</TE>
<TE>   Mahmoud Sami, 38, owner of an electronics store, said he saw the
videotaped confession and didn't believe it was coerced.</TE>
<TE>   "We need this sort of deterrent, even though I'm not sure it
always works," he said. "People continue selling out to the
Israelis."</TE>

Foreign envoys fear backlash.</DH>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SKOPJE, Macedonia</DL>
<LD>Angry Macedonians blocked a highway into this capital Monday to
prevent former ethnic Albanian rebel leader Ali Ahmeti from attending
a political rally after two Macedonian policemen were gunned down.</LD>
<LD>   The machine-gun attack came three weeks before the nation is to
hold elections, the first since the country averted civil war between
ethnic Albanian rebels and government forces last year.</LD>
<LD>   Fearing a backlash, European and U.S. envoys urged the government
to act with restraint, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
condemned the killings as an attempt to stoke tension. Ahmeti issued
a statement saying the political gathering was canceled.</LD>
<TE>   Police said they suspect the drive-by attack in the western town
of Gostivar, populated mainly by ethnic Albanians, was ethnically
motivated. Ten people were detained.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the disbanded rebel army are contenders in the Sept. 15
general election, but diplomats worry that violence by renegades
could wreck the peace process.</TE>

<HD>7 Israeli Arabs Arrested in Bus Bombing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JENIN, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Israeli forces arrested seven Israeli Arabs on Monday who allegedly
helped a Palestinian suicide bomber blow up a commuter bus. A leader
of the Islamic militant group Hamas was detained in a separate raid.</LD>
<LD>   The seven Israeli Arabs, all members of the same family, are
accused of involvement in an Aug. 4 suicide bombing on a bus at the
Meron junction in northern Israel. The blast killed nine passengers
and pedestrians.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the suspects helped store explosives in a nursery
school, dressed the assailant as a tourist and then scouted the
target--a bus filled with Israeli soldiers and civilians.</LD>
<TE>   Raanan Gissin, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's spokesman,
called the arrests an "ominous development" and said militants "are
[trying] to recruit Israeli Arabs to participate actively in
terrorist activity." But Gissin and Israeli Arab leaders noted that
the vast majority of Israel's 1 million Arab citizens are not engaged
in terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in the West Bank, Israeli troops raided the Jenin
refugee camp and arrested Jamal Abul Haji, 44, a regional leader of
Hamas. Israeli security sources said he was behind three suicide
bombings that killed 39 people.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, the Israeli military announced a series of steps to
ease restrictions on Bethlehem, which was handed over to Palestinian
security Aug. 20. "Because of the relative calm," a military
statement said, Israel will allow workers, merchants and merchandise
from Bethlehem to enter Israel. Also, teachers and clergy are to have
freedom of movement.</TE>

<HD>Macao Slowly Wakes Up and Smells the Iced Mocha</HD>
<DH>China: Starbucks has opened an outlet in the
coffee-drinking enclave. Many residents and tourists are curious but
wary of the U.S. export.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MACAO</DL>
<LD>For six years, the Starbucks coffeehouse chain has expanded in Asia
by selling its coffee to nations of tea drinkers.</LD>
<LD>   Now there's a new challenge.</LD>
<LD>   This month, the Seattle-based company opened an outlet in one of
Asia's few genuine coffee cultures--the former Portuguese colony of
Macao.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't want to compete directly with the local coffeehouses,"
said Pedro Man, president of Starbucks Coffee Asia Pacific Ltd. "We
just want to be part of the scene."</TE>
<TE>   That it already is.</TE>
<TE>   Ensconced in an elegant, brightly colored colonial home along the
old cobblestone Senado Square that forms the heart of central Macao,
the Chinese enclave's newest coffee hangout--corporate flag, green
logo and all--has generated considerable curiosity.</TE>
<TE>   One day last week, a steady flow of local residents and tourists
from mainland China warily approached the entrance and carefully eyed
the invitation to "discover the Starbucks experience."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the curious appeared either too unsure or too shy to
enter, but some of the 10 customers sitting at tables inside said
they were already converts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's close to the office, and the quality of what you get is
good," attorney Luis Resadas said as he swilled the last of a
midmorning espresso. "I'm glad they're here. I'll be back."</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, the place gets busy, according to the outlet's
manager, Ivan Wong. In the afternoons and early evenings, he said,
the shyness fades and lines form to sample the latest U.S. cultural
export, such as an iced mocha or a frappuccino.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some have already proclaimed Starbucks a one-time-only
experience.</TE>
<TE>   "Overpriced and not very good," said Tony Wilkinson, a land
appraiser who settled in Macao 11 years ago. "And who wants to drink
coffee from a plastic cup? I want something I can hold on to."</TE>
<TE>   Owners of other coffee shops around the square don't seem worried
about the competition. They say some of their regulars tried the new
place--where an espresso runs 20% to 30% more than at a local
shop--but are already back.</TE>
<TE>   "Starbucks is Starbucks; my coffee is different, my cakes are
different," said Mario Vale, who owns a cafe called O Barril tucked
into a narrow side street off the square. It is about 100 yards and a
cultural world away from the slick signs and modern decor of the new
Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   "My customers are Portuguese," he added confidently. "They'll stay
with me."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, traditional coffee tastes in Macao are a long way from
a Starbucks iced latte.</TE>
<TE>   At O Barril, for example, customers prefer to sip a strong
espresso. Here, Vale noted with pride, even regular coffee is run
through an espresso machine. At other cafes, many older Chinese
residents prefer a concoction of half tea and half espresso known as
yin yeung.</TE>
<TE>   But those involved in the latest Starbucks venture say it's more
about offering locals an alternative than trying to compete directly
against established houses. Possibly because of this, even longtime
residents who say they know little about the new arrival believe it's
probably a good thing for Macao.</TE>
<TE>   Lancelot Rodrigues, the local director of Catholic Social
Services, said that he will stick with his homemade blend of
Timorese, Brazilian and Malaysian coffee as his preferred morning
drink but that new businesses bring badly needed new jobs to the
area.</TE>
<TE>   "There are lots of cafes here--why not Starbucks?" he said. "They
drink coffee there, don't they?"</TE>

<HD>U.N. Conference Quickly Turns to Who Will Pay for Ambitious
Aims</HD>
<DH>Environment: Summit's focus is on fostering development
that won't harm the planet. Poor nations say to do that, they need
more help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>The World Summit on Sustainable Development opened here Monday with
the lofty aspiration that representatives of more than 190 nations
will agree on a plan to develop the poorest countries without further
fouling air, polluting water or degrading land. Yet negotiations
quickly got bogged down between impoverished countries demanding more
aid and wealthy nations reluctant to give it.</LD>
<LD>   South African President Thabo Mbeki opened the meeting with a call
for participants to pursue the goals adopted a decade ago at the
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Those included reversing
"environmental destruction, poverty and inequality." Unfortunately,
little progress has been made, he told the delegates from around the
globe, some in colorful garb and many sporting earphones to hear his
speech translated into their languages.</LD>
<LD>   "The tragic result of this is the avoidable increase in human
misery and ecological degradation," Mbeki said.</LD>
<TE>   The 10-day, U.N.-sponsored conference has drawn about 12,600
people so far, including 5,730 government representatives, to a
convention center in the Johannesburg suburb of Sandton. Ringed by
concrete barricades, razor wire and 10,000 extra police officers, the
first day's sessions unfolded without significant protests.</TE>
<TE>   But additional demonstrations are planned for the days ahead, and
authorities are hoping there will be no repeat of skirmishes over the
weekend that prompted police to fire stun grenades at 500 protesters
and detain scores of others.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a summit for anarchy," warned Nkosazana Zuma, South
Africa's foreign minister. "If people come to march peacefully, there
will be no problem with the police. If you break the law, the law
will take its course."</TE>
<TE>   Inside the summit compound, public speechmaking went on as
scheduled, but negotiations struggled. The goals of the conference
include reducing by half the 1 billion people without access to clean
water and the 2 billion without proper sanitation. Other goals are to
supply the poor with cheap but renewable energy and proper health
care and to reverse the despoiling of agricultural land and the
number of plant and animal species threatened with extinction.</TE>
<TE>   A number of countries want an action plan to accompany the
"Johannesburg Declaration" that would set unambiguous goals and also
dates by which nations would have to show measurable progress. Such
commitments, although not legally binding, are also sought for
expanding the world's reliance on solar, wind and other renewable
energy sources to reduce its use of fossil fuels and the resulting
pollution and emissions of globe-warming gases. But the Bush
administration--which pulled out of the international Kyoto Protocol,
designed to reduce greenhouse gases--has so far resisted setting
specific goals and timetables.</TE>
<TE>   "Goals are important," said John Turner, the assistant secretary
of State who is leading the U.S. delegation. "But they are only lofty
rhetoric without the commitment of [financial] resources."</TE>
<TE>   A similar tussle is going on over the question of money.
Developing nations want the United States and other wealthy countries
to more than triple the amount of foreign aid they provide. Only with
such economic help, these countries argue, can they protect their
forests and other natural resources from being sacrificed to feed and
shelter the poor or provide fuel to cook their meals.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. delegation emphasized the role of private investment
rather than government aid to spur development. Turner suggested that
how others view the Bush administration on these issues will change
once it begins to roll out its package of "real action" projects and
partnerships to tackle thorny environmental, economic and social
problems.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, unlike leaders of 104 other nations, will not come
here to present his case. Instead, he is dispatching Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell to lead the delegation in the final days of the
summit.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Decision Against Group Pleases China</HD>
<DH>Asia: Washington says it will freeze the assets of an
Islamic organization that Beijing has accused of terrorist acts in a
drive for independence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU and SONNI EFRON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>In a political victory for China's Communist regime, the United
States has declared that it will freeze the financial assets of a
shadowy Islamic group reputedly dedicated to promoting independence
for the northwestern Chinese region of Xinjiang.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage, on a two-day
visit here, said Monday that the Bush administration now considers
the so-called East Turkestan Islamic Movement a terrorist
organization because it carries out attacks on civilians. China
accuses the group of waging a violent separatist campaign in
Xinjiang, home to a Turkic-speaking people known as the Uighurs, most
of whom are Muslim.</LD>
<LD>   Armitage's announcement came as a surprise because several months
ago, Washington explicitly refused to draw a link between its war on
terrorism and Beijing's attempt to crush separatist sentiment in the
region, a large territory rich in natural resources.</LD>
<TE>   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
that although the U.S. would freeze the assets of the East Turkestan
Islamic Movement, a decision had not been made on whether to
officially designate it a terrorist organization.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Boucher nor Armitage explained what information had
prompted the change in the administration's thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Other sources said the administration reportedly has gathered
evidence from Uighurs captured in Afghanistan that validates the
Chinese assertion that the movement has connections to the Al Qaeda
terrorist network and has committed terrorist acts inside and outside
China.</TE>
<TE>   These sources said a decision to place the group on America's
official "terrorist list" will be forthcoming, perhaps as early as
this week.</TE>
<TE>   There are reports that the U.S. has perhaps half a dozen Uighur
suspects in custody at its naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and
that the Chinese government has been seeking to interrogate them. A
senior U.S. official acknowledged hearing "something about" Uighurs
being held at Guantanamo but declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S., the Chinese government has
sought to use the global effort against terrorism as a reason for its
crackdown in Xinjiang.</TE>
<TE>   The human rights group Amnesty International said in March that
Chinese security forces had closed mosques, detained suspected
"splittists" and muzzled the local media to discourage unrest among
Uighurs.</TE>
<TE>   That same month, the State Department criticized Beijing for human
rights abuses against political dissidents in Xinjiang.</TE>
<TE>   But Armitage said Monday that "after careful study, we judged that
[the East Turkestan Islamic Movement] was a terrorist group."</TE>
<TE>   Few people had heard of the group until the Chinese government
identified it in January as a militant Islamic force that was bent on
prying Xinjiang from China and setting up an independent republic.</TE>
<TE>   In a detailed report, Beijing accused the group of working with
Osama bin Laden, who allegedly pledged a "fabulous sum" of money for
Muslim extremists to train and arm themselves for a low-level
campaign of violence in Xinjiang.</TE>
<TE>   The report accused the separatists of being responsible for 162
deaths by bombing, arson and poisoning from 1990 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Larry M. Wortzel, a former U.S. military attache in Beijing who is
now head of the Asian studies center at the Heritage Foundation think
tank in Washington, said the organization is "pretty terroristic.
They engaged in murder, terror and explosions.</TE>
<TE>   "They have ... regularly gone out and beheaded people they didn't
like, particularly Han Chinese, and whole families of people," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing has said that "double standards" have kept the U.S. from
recognizing the fight in Xinjiang as a battle against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Armitage said he stressed "the absolute necessity to respect
minority rights," in particular the Uighurs', in his talks with
China's top leaders Monday.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, in a speech last year in Shanghai, said the war on
terrorism should not be used as an excuse to persecute minorities,
and added, "We must respect legitimate political aspirations and at
the same time oppose all who spread terror in the name of politics or
religion."</TE>
<TE>   But human rights groups fear that China's Communist
government--with Washington apparently on its side, in however
limited a form--will now feel free to be even more aggressive in its
clampdown.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with Human Rights Watch in Washington said they had also
heard, but could not confirm, reports of Uighur suspects' being held
at Guantanamo Bay. However, the rights group said any Uighur suspects
held there should not be extradited to China because they would be
unlikely to get a fair trial and could be subject to torture or
execution.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's move was based on an executive order signed by Bush after
Sept. 11 that allows the U.S. to track down and freeze assets of
suspect groups. Armitage expressed hope that Washington's decision
would have "some effect on helping to dry up some of the funds" of
the East Turkestan Islamic Movement.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear whether the move was connected with China's
announcement of long-awaited regulations tightening control over the
export of missile-related technology.</TE>
<TE>   Although the new rules were announced Sunday, they were officially
approved several days ago.</TE>
<TE>   Armitage welcomed the new export regulations. Whether they will
lead to a lifting of the ban on U.S. commercial satellite launches on
Chinese rockets, which Beijing has lobbied for, will be worked out in
later negotiations, Armitage said.</TE>
<TE>   He and his Chinese hosts also discussed Iraq, a country that poses
a continuing threat to the U.S. and Iraq's neighbors, Armitage told
the Chinese. The Iraqi foreign minister, Naji Sabri, arrived in China
on Monday for a visit, but Armitage said the timing was coincidental.</TE>
<TE>   Armitage described the primary focus of his trip to Beijing, which
ends today, as preparing for an upcoming summit--the third--between
Bush and Chinese President Jiang Zemin, to be held in Texas in
October.</TE>

<HD>Zimbabwe's First Lady Grabs a Luxury Farm for Herself</HD>
<DH>Africa: The redistribution of whites' property is supposed
to benefit landless blacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ and PETA THORNYCROFT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>MAZOWE, Zimbabwe</DL>
<LD>Grace Mugabe came here last week, but her visit had nothing to do
with promoting literacy, health care or any other official duties
that come with being Zimbabwe's first lady.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Mugabe came to personally evict white farmers John and
Eva Matthews, a septuagenarian couple who own the sprawling
2,500-acre Iron Mask Estate.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses said Mugabe--who was accompanied by senior army
officers, government officials and young toughs from her husband's
ruling party--told the couple that they had 48 hours to vacate their
farm or be arrested.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm taking over this farm," witnesses quoted the first lady as
saying.</TE>
<TE>   Mugabe's husband, President Robert Mugabe, has promised that his
planned confiscation of white farms will benefit thousands of
landless black Zimbabweans, but so far senior Cabinet ministers, top
army officials and the president's relatives and friends appear to be
among the big beneficiaries.</TE>
<TE>   During the last two weeks, Mugabe's security forces have arrested
about 200 of an estimated 2,900 white commercial farmers who have
defied the government's Aug. 8 deadline to leave their land without
compensation.</TE>
<TE>   With southern Africa already struggling with man-made and natural
challenges including bad weather, disease and corruption, analysts
say Mugabe's land grabs are endangering about 6 million
Zimbabweans--nearly half the country's population. Millions of poor
Zimbabweans now need international food aid to survive.</TE>
<TE>   As the United States and other donors send shipments of corn to
feed starving Zimbabweans, top U.S. and British officials say they
want to work with the international community--particularly
Zimbabwe's African neighbors--to isolate Mugabe, who they say rigged
polls earlier this year to win reelection. Western governments oppose
the land seizures, which are often violent and chaotic.</TE>
<TE>   Mugabe says he is simply trying to address injustices of the
colonial era, when blacks were driven off the most fertile land to
make way for white farmers. He is expected to square off with Western
officials this week at a United Nations summit in Johannesburg, South
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Mugabe's opponents are also waiting for him in Johannesburg. On
Monday, about 100 supporters of Zimbabwe's opposition Movement for
Democratic Change, which is usually barred in Zimbabwe from holding
such protests, chanted anti-Mugabe slogans in front of a convention
center where the summit is being held. Protesters waved placards
declaring: "Mugabe is an election thief" and "Mugabe is starving his
own people."</TE>
<TE>   "Mugabe argues land for the poor, but it's a lie," said MDC
spokesman Moses Mzila-Ndlovu. "It's about power."</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, Mugabe reshuffled his Cabinet to replace a
leading dissenter, Finance Minister Simba Makoni, who has sharply
challenged the president on how to rescue the country's stricken
economy. Makoni advocated devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar after
black market exchange rates soared to more than 10 times the frozen
official rate and annual inflation topped 120%.</TE>
<TE>   Mugabe responded angrily that people who wanted currency
devaluation were "saboteurs."</TE>
<TE>   Devaluation would have benefited mainly gold and tobacco
exporters, who would have been able to sell their products at more
favorable prices, according to Moeletsi Mbeki, deputy chairman of the
South Africa Institute for International Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "But Mugabe is out to destroy the tobacco farmers, and the
exchange rate is only one of the mechanisms he's using," said Mbeki,
the brother of South African President Thabo Mbeki.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the U.S. State Department dismissed Mugabe's reshuffle,
saying there was nothing he could do to repair his credibility.</TE>
<TE>   The Matthewses reared cattle, and planted tobacco, corn and
soybeans on their property in Mazowe until two years ago. Members of
Mugabe's ruling party who are also veterans of the war for black
majority rule, which ended with the establishment of Zimbabwe in
1980, invaded the property and stopped all farming.</TE>
<TE>   The Matthewses' wooded estate, with its 29-room farmhouse, two
swimming pools and fertile land--remained one of the most coveted
farms in the lush Mazowe area, a 30-minute drive north of Harare, the
Zimbabwean capital.</TE>
<TE>   When Grace Mugabe visited the farm last week, she saw sweeping
vistas of trees displaying spring leaves ranging from pale pink to
burgundy to bronze, on rolling woodlands that met the big African sky
in the distance.</TE>
<TE>   Eva Matthews bought the farm with her first husband 35 years ago
and raised her three children there.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the army officers who came with Grace Mugabe told the
Matthewses to find alternative accommodation as the first lady would
be moving in shortly.</TE>
<TE>   When a black farm worker who had been employed by the Matthewses
asked what would happen to him, the first lady replied: "Go and live
by the river over there," according to farm workers who asked that
their identities not be revealed for fear of retribution.</TE>
<TE>   During the weekend, the Matthewses auctioned their remaining 135
head of cattle for about $50,000. Half the money will be used to pay
benefits to the farm's 15 workers. Eva Matthews said she and her
husband will use the remainder to start a new life. They are moving
to a small apartment they own in Harare.</TE>
<TE>   "She is getting a wonderful home with everything," Eva Matthews
said of Grace Mugabe. "It looks rather ordinary from the front, but
it is huge. When the children were at home, we used it all. We rather
let the garden go at the end, but it was so colorful."</TE>
<TE>   Grace Mugabe, the president's former secretary, has a reputation
among many people as a profligate shopper. Before the European Union
imposed travel bans on dozens of the Zimbabwean president's friends,
relatives and cronies, numerous news reports said she frequently used
state-owned Air Zimbabwe to go to London and Paris on lavish shopping
jaunts.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition groups and commercial farmers charge that her brother,
a former envoy to Canada, used youth members of the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front party to chase away the owner
and about 200 workers and their families from a farm in the Glendale
district, a two-hour drive northwest of Harare. They say that the
president's sister, Sabina, lives on a confiscated farm 80 miles west
of Harare.</TE>
<TE>   A list prepared by Justice for Agriculture, a new lobbying group
for white farmers, says that about 200 army officers, influential
businessmen and senior ZANU-PF members are the new owners of formerly
white-owned farms.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials say the eviction of 2,900 of the 3,500 white
farmers will be almost completed by the end of this month.</TE>
<TE>   About a third of the 3,500 white farmers who were productive
before land seizures began in February 2000, are still on their
farms, but many of them have been prevented from growing crops. More
than 600 were evicted immediately after presidential elections in
March, and several hundred more since the Aug. 8 deadline.</TE>
<TE>   At this time of year, the roads leading north and west of Harare
usually are lined with wheat fields. But this year, travelers drive
through fields covered with weeds and thousands of felled trees.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists say settlers have cut down trees to sell wood
for food, leading to serious deforestation. Some estimates suggest
that about 50% of wildlife on private land--among them zebra, giraffe
and cheetah--have also been slaughtered for food.</TE>

correspondent Thornycroft from Mazowe.</TE>

<HD>Life and Death of a Guardian Angel</HD>
<DH>Minnie Patterson brought running water to town and could
always be counted on for a lift, spiritual or financial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK ARAX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last of three parts</LD>
<LD>   TEVISTON, Calif.--The little white shack in a field of tumbleweeds
was all set up for dying.</LD>
<LD>   The living room--an old railroad boxcar--had been cleared to make
way for a hospital bed. A pillow had been placed beside the one
window that looked out to something other than broken earth. With her
head propped up just right, Minnie Patterson could see the grapevine
that her husband, Willie, had planted upon their coming West more
than half a century ago.</LD>
<TE>   She had raised two children and nurtured three generations of
neighbor kids, and now the matriarch of Teviston was beginning
another journey, this one to a land of no mores. No more tears, the
preacher in cowboy boots assured her, no more sorrows.</TE>
<TE>   Her casket had already been chosen--a military gray embroidered in
silver, for she had done battle as surely as any soldier. And her
daughter, Patricia, had written her obituary just the way she liked
it, with a nod to her devoted church service and to her sweet potato
pies, light on the nutmeg. Her million-dollar mansion stood waiting
on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   Only Minnie Pearl Patterson, a sharecropper's daughter born May
28, 1913, in Carthage, Texas, wasn't going anywhere just yet. If she
had a say-so in such matters, she was staying put right here in her
living room.</TE>
<TE>   "You all fussin' over me like something's gonna happen," she told
her daughter and a nurse, fixing a glare that made people stammer. "A
pack of turkey vultures got more couth than the two of you."</TE>
<TE>   She could still throw a zinger or two but it was at night--when
the past took over the present and hallucinations replaced
reality--that she couldn't stop chattering. People long gone, her
husband included, were rapping their bony knuckles on her windowpane,
rattling to be let in.</TE>
<TE>   She stared into the half-moon dark and saw a skinny figure
scurrying straight toward her. Frankie Allen, that persistent
neighbor boy, had come calling again. Only this time it wasn't to
sweet-talk her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Open up, Patricia. Frankie boy's wailing like some poor hound.
Says his daddy didn't go to the cotton fields this morning. Says his
daddy picked up a gun and tore a hole through his momma's back. They
found him lying in a little ravine behind the shack. His head right
shot off. Now how'd he get that big long barrel pointed toward his
self and still pull the trigger? They said they found his daddy
barefooted. That he did it with his big toe.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnie Patterson had seen hard times and dreams come up dry
like so many other Black Okies. But poverty and lost hope weren't the
whole of her life. Her Willie was a good man who didn't drink or
cheat or bide an idle day. He had the good sense to leave her a house
and five acres paid for.</TE>
<TE>   She had lived a contented life--quiet, solid, proud. Many of her
neighbors had done the same. Amid all the despair of the land, it was
easy to miss.</TE>
<TE>   Theirs was the other story of the black migrants who left the
rural South to start over again in the rural West, of fathers and
mothers breaking their backs as field hands and domestics and raising
children to know their history and church and a Southern way of doing
things, whether it was cooking ribs over a slow fire or fishing for
crappie in the ditches that passed for rivers. Now those children
were returning home to help the old folks die.</TE>
<TE>   Minnie Patterson came to this patch of brown surrounded by a sea
of white cotton in the fall of 1945. She decided that first night she
wouldn't be staying. What kind of land have you brought me to? she
asked her husband. Driving three miles to fetch water. Reading
Scripture by kerosene lamp. You might as well have kept me hitched to
the plantations of east Texas. She wanted a home, nothing fancy, in
the civilized city. A tract house up the road in Fresno or
Bakersfield would do.</TE>
<TE>   But Willie Patterson kept pounding nails and boards onto that
crooked hut in the middle of horned toad country, and the black
people kept trickling in from Oklahoma and Arkansas and Texas and
Louisiana. They had come looking for a place where the cotton grew a
little taller and the white folks had been raised up a little nicer.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Mrs. Patterson would progress from Sunday school
teacher to church president to grande dame of her little country
settlement on the outskirts of Tulare County. Now on her bed in the
living room, as another night fell, she wasn't going quietly.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Patterson, 55, could hear the voice hoarse with cancer
from the next room. She shook her head at the way her mother's mind
leaped so graceful across time. One moment she was helping dig the
well that brought drinking water to Teviston--1959--and the next
moment it was 25 years later and she was burying her own mother
again. Patricia began to think of her mother's flights as lyrical
riffs, funny and sad.</TE>
<TE>   "Her voice is barely a whisper during the day, but at night it's
loud and clear as a bell," she said. "Sometimes when I can't sleep,
I'll come outside and sit under the stars and take a deep breath. You
can still breathe deep out here in the country. I'll try to listen
out for the old sounds when I was a kid, but they're not here.
Everything's from Mexico now. The music, the traffic, the shouts in
the night. So my mother's voice is the one voice I still recognize.
It's the one voice that still comforts me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Patricia, why's Mr. Batilla making such a fuss across the way?
He's been crowing like a rooster ever before the sun came up. Don't
tell me you kids moved his outhouse again in the middle of the night.
Don't tell me he went to go pee in the dark and fell in his mess hole
again?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnie Patterson didn't know she was already dying that spring day
two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   After enduring a winter of fog so thick that it blotted out
horizons and shadows, she welcomed an invitation to take a drive
through the orchards, pink and white with blossoms. She hopped into
the car with Marge Karle, the white woman whose house she had been
cleaning for 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   From field hand to domestic, this was how things progressed in the
San Joaquin Valley for a black woman of her era. Karle, who lived
down the road in Pixley, treated her like something more than a maid.
They gabbed over coffee and Swanson TV dinners, and each Christmas,
Karle handed her a bonus that was more than fair. Minnie Patterson
might have even considered her the first true white friend she ever
had. But she had come through the service porch wearing her white
uniform for so many years that she could never be sure where
employment ended and friendship began.</TE>
<TE>   They were driving to a Save Mart in Tulare when a small truck lost
control and veered toward them. The collision knocked Karle's car on
its side and it skidded into the oleander bushes that divided Highway
99. A few more feet and they would have been crushed by the oncoming
traffic. Mrs. Patterson suffered only cuts and cracked ribs, but the
X-rays showed something worse. The thyroid cancer she had beaten in
1995 was back, and it had spread to her lungs.</TE>
<TE>   She wanted no part of radiation treatments. She was curled up on
her bed at home the day Patricia, the oldest of her two children,
decided to move back. Her worst fear, dying in a convalescent
hospital, wouldn't come true.</TE>
<TE>   But she wasn't inclined to make it easy on her daughter. For
years, she had called on Patricia to watch over her little brother,
Kenneth, a college football star who made big money as a hospital
administrator before cocaine and liquor took over his life. He was
now living 170 miles to the north in Modesto, confined to a
wheelchair after a car crash nearly killed him.</TE>
<TE>   In her son's absence, Mrs. Patterson leaned on Patricia even more.
She fought over bath time and the way Patricia cooked salmon--baked,
not fried--and the hours she spent at work as an administrator for a
nursing facility.</TE>
<TE>   Patrica had watched her mother take care of her grandmother, a
pistol of a woman, in her last days. No matter how demanding Grandma
Leana became, her mother always treated her like a queen. Now
Patricia was determined to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   She shared nursing duties with Garry Close, a down-on-his-luck
welder who lived in the back trailer and cared for Mrs. Patterson
with tender hands. They waited for the stages to play out, for denial
to turn to anger and anger to turn to acceptance. But Mrs. Patterson,
all 5-foot-4 and 90 pounds, seemed stuck on anger, and it had begun
to do a funny thing.</TE>
<TE>   She was no longer bent up in bed, waiting to die. She
was polishing off whole meals of chicken fried steak and washing them
down with Jerusalem Water, a mix of Mountain Dew and apple juice.
Then one morning she awoke and told Patricia she'd had a change of
heart. She wanted to be driven 40 miles to a clinic in Bakersfield to
begin weekly cancer treatments.</TE>
<TE>   After a month of radiation, she began to feel ornery enough to
take a few steps. She announced one evening that she didn't like
sleeping in the living room. She wanted to be back in her bedroom
amid her knitted afghans that won first prize in the Tulare County
Fair.</TE>
<TE>   She hated even more that her privacy was gone. A baby monitor kept
a constant vigil on her sleep, eavesdropping on her dreams and
hallucinations, her stashed-away tales. She wanted to be in control
of her story, to tell it straight up and in the lucid light of day.
"And don't interpret for me," she scolded her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Her parents never married, she said, and she saw her father only
when he could tiptoe past the women in her family. He had left their
Texas cotton patch and gone off to work for the railroad. He would
show up out of nowhere waving a new pair of shoes for her. She'd
barely tie the laces and he'd be gone again.</TE>
<TE>   She never got past the sixth grade in a two-room schoolhouse in
segregated Carthage. She'd walk home through the fields and see her
mother with a cotton sack slung over her shoulders. If she didn't
jump in and snatch a few hundred pounds of her own before dark,
there'd be hell to pay. Her mother could fashion a switch out of
anything, and her backside knew the sting of every kind of tree
branch in east Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd cry when I'd see that switch. She'd tell me, 'Well, you know
you didn't come up with your quota of cotton today,' and then she'd
whip me eight or nine times and say, 'I guess tomorrow you'll do
better.' "</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, Leana, could never choose the right man. After three
children by different fathers, she gave up trying. Minnie Patterson,
though, wasn't the kind to settle for less.</TE>
<TE>   She had come west as an Army bride in 1945, and her beloved Willie
Patterson wasn't your run-of-the-mill man. From the top of his felt
hat to the tips of his polished shoes, he knew how to dress on
Sundays. No canary yellow or electric blue suits for him. "He was
some man. Easy to get along with and handsome, too. Look at that
picture of him. Don't it all look good to you?"</TE>
<TE>   Her sister's husband, a sweet man known as Uncle Lucky, had
arrived in California first. He was picking potatoes in Kern County
and made it sound so good. The Pattersons didn't come out by way of
school bus or flatbed truck like so many other Black Okies. They took
the train from Dallas to Los Angeles, where Uncle Lucky met them.</TE>
<TE>   He drove them up the Tejon Pass, the gorge that separated the
lights of Hollywood from the farm fields of the San Joaquin Valley,
California's Mason-Dixon line. An hour north of Los Angeles, the
mountain suddenly opened and revealed a big-mouthed flatland below.
Cotton beside grapes beside peaches beside pomegranates beside
dairies, everything three times bigger than it was in the South.</TE>
<TE>   Because local real estate covenants barred them from living in the
cities, they turned on to a sandy road full of chuckholes and settled
among families living in tents and boxcars and little stoop houses
made of cardboard and grape stakes. One gypsy family had taken up in
an abandoned bus that read destination "Guam."</TE>
<TE>   "It was worse than Carthage," Mrs. Patterson said. "I told my
husband that I had come too far to settle for this."</TE>
<TE>   He found a job as a maintenance man at Schenley Winery and signed
over all his paychecks to her. With throwaway lumber, he built a
two-room house on their five acres. He got drinking water from a
spigot in Pixley, storing it in 50-gallon oil drums so it would last
a week.</TE>
<TE>   For 15 years, this was their life. Then Teviston, with a good push
from Minnie Patterson, decided to form its own water district and
deliver drinking water to the 150 shacks.</TE>
<TE>   The day the water gushed through the plumbing that Willie
Patterson pieced together was the day their house became a home. No
more bathing out of buckets. No more walks in the middle of the
freezing night to go to the bathroom in an outhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "I shouted, 'Hallelujah!' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We Pattersons got our own church. Have had for 50 years. But that
don't stop these full-of-the-Lord folks from knocking on our door.
Tell 'em we got our own way of worshipping. We may not holler or roll
funny in no aisles, but that don't mean our Holy Ghost is meek.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Patterson supervised the care of 40 patients with
cerebral palsy and autism at a state nursing facility in nearby
Porterville. Now, her mother had become an extension of her job.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first promises she made to herself was that she would
try to deal with her as another patient. Depersonalize, the
psychologist at work admonished her. The second promise was all about
the care she would provide. It would be first-rate, right down to the
vow that no matter how bedridden her mother became, she wasn't going
to suffer from a single bedsore.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia had pulled some strings to get a special mattress with a
pump that kept a constant flow of air around her mother's body. She
thought her mother would love the sensation of sleeping on bubble
wrap. But another reaction greeted her that summer day when she
pulled into the long dirt driveway and opened the door.</TE>
<TE>   "How dare you," the old lady snarled, sitting in a chair in her
bedroom, nostrils flaring. "Who says I need another mattress? You out
driving your big fancy car and screwing around and making decisions
affecting this household. And never telling me about 'em."</TE>
<TE>   "Screwing around? You're impossible, you know that woman?"</TE>
<TE>   Patricia would later recall the look on her mother's face--the
meanest, nastiest look she had ever seen her wear. Depersonalize, she
kept repeating the mantra. This is not my mother. This is another
patient. She took a step to leave the room and began crying.</TE>
<TE>   It was a beautiful full moon night and every impulse told her to
get in the car and take off. Let the highway decide. Los Angeles, the
Central Coast, anywhere but this crummy little shack in the middle of
the desert. "There have been times in my life where my mother drove
me to get in the car and take off, and I might be in San Jose before
I stopped shaking. But fate gives you only so many of those trips."</TE>
<TE>   So Patricia went outside and took a deep breath and then went to
sleep. That week, Mrs. Patterson began breathing for hours at a time
without the oxygen machine. The tumor in her lungs was shrinking. The
radiation had done its job.</TE>
<TE>   "Radiation, hell," Mrs. Patterson said. "That's God."</TE>
<TE>   That Sunday, she put on a new pink dress that Patricia bought her
for Mother's Day. She was going to church to watch her pastor, the
Rev. Jesse James Freeman, deliver one final sermon. After 40 years at
the First Baptist Church of Pixley, the old preacher was retiring.</TE>
<TE>   Taking Mrs. Patterson anywhere was a chore and Patricia usually
showed great patience. But it was a hot day and the sweat was pouring
off her brow as she moved her mother and all her
accouterments--wheelchair, canister of oxygen and long plastic air
hose--from car to church.</TE>
<TE>   "Come on Mom, you're fiddling. You know that? You're fiddling."</TE>
<TE>   "The devil trusted the turkey and the turkey put his eye out,"
Mrs. Patterson deadpanned.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a new one. Am I the turkey or the devil?"</TE>
<TE>   "You the devil."</TE>
<TE>   "OK, then, I guess I'm at the right place," Patricia
said, laughing. "Your hands look dry, Momma. Let's put some lotion on
them."</TE>
<TE>   As they entered the sanctuary, the ushers in white gloves and
captain's patches cracked big smiles. "Hello, Sister Patterson. So
good to see you." With one arm bent at a 90-degree angle behind the
back, they moved like robots, right to left in square corners.</TE>
<TE>   They had Minnie Patterson to thank for their military sharpness.
She had been appalled the first time she stepped foot in the church
in the mid-1940s. The ushers were sloppy, not at all the way she
remembered ushers in black churches in the South. She decided to
teach them by example, becoming the snappiest and most erect usher of
them all. The only tilt to Sister Patterson, they joked, was the
crooked way her Sunday hat sat on her head.</TE>
<TE>   It took only a moment for the Rev. Freeman to make a nod to her
presence. "Sister Patterson is with us this morning. I'm so happy to
see her. Amen. God can work a wonder. Don't ever forget that. God can
and God will."</TE>
<TE>   He stepped back from the pulpit, and the man with the electric
guitar began strumming the sound of business. This was a church that
tended to its bottom line first. Whether a dime or a dollar, the
giving took place front and center on an oak table--before God and 85
parishioners. They gave to the Sunday school and the Po' Saints, a
fund for those behind in their water and light bills.</TE>
<TE>   Two deacons behind the table, one in a purple suit and the other
wearing a dashiki, counted the money right there. The final tally was
written down in a thick ledger book. Sister Taylor waddled up front
to announce the news.</TE>
<TE>   "Sunday school and Po' Saint offering $79.92. Tithes $125. The
grand total for today is $204.92."</TE>
<TE>   Only then did the reverend, a little man with alligator cowboy
boots and his head shaved clean, return to the pulpit. He looked out
to the congregation and paused for a second, his big eyes fixing on
Patricia. She had grown up playing piano and singing in the church,
and he signaled her to the altar to perform one last time for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess you all know that my heart is real full this
morning," she said, taking a seat behind the keys. She began playing
and singing an old gospel number about a God who piled on the
troubles but knew in the end "just how much we can bear."</TE>
<TE>   The mother who had always picked apart her performances--"Why
can't you smile up there a little more? ... You need to slow down and
feel the music"--had her head down the whole time, wiping tears from
her eyes.</TE>
<TE>   The stage now was set for Freeman's farewell. "I'm ready to go and
I go with this question: What are we? Who are we? Where we are
traveling to?"</TE>
<TE>   "Glory!"</TE>
<TE>   "Where?"</TE>
<TE>   "Glory!"</TE>
<TE>   "If you had a lot of money, you can't wear but one suit at a time,
drive one car at a time, sleep in one bed at a time, eat one meal at
a time. I'm afraid if I had a lot of money, I might go crazy worrying
about who was going to take it away. Since I don't have any, I can go
to bed and sleep good every night. Don't you know that? Say Amen,
laddie."</TE>
<TE>   "Amen."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's a poor bird who won't go pinning feathers on itself. So I'll
say it like it is. I made a fine sweet potato pie. And my
Million-Dollar Pound cake was light and moist and just the right
sugar. But you should have tasted my lemon meringue. The secret? Wish
I could remember to tell you.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On a crisp winter evening, Patricia Patterson grabbed her
lawn chair and headed to the eucalyptus tree at the side of their
house. She was feeling tired and melancholy. The ghosts that were
visiting her Mom had begun to rattle on her window, too.</TE>
<TE>   "When I sit here and I'm chilling out, I can see all their faces,"
Patricia said. "I see Joanne Morris, my best friend, and the
playhouse we had right there. I can see the Jordan family in their
little rundown shack, and I can hear Mr. Jordan drunk and abusing his
wife. There's my mom and grandma and Aunt Molly chasing chickens and
wringing their necks and just letting them flop. Flop till they die.
I can see the basketball court that my father carved in the dirt
right over there and all the kids coming over to our place to shoot
hoops.</TE>
<TE>   "You might not believe it, but this was a community once. It was
poor, no way around it. And there was lots of stuff going down. But
we were a community."</TE>
<TE>   If someone needed a lift, spiritual or financial, they came
knocking on the Pattersons' door. The little white house with
fluorescent green trim might have sagged three feet in the middle but
the people of Teviston had never seen a shack look so fine. The
Pattersons sat on good furniture and watched Ed Sullivan on a good
TV, and there was a piano, of all things, sitting upright in the
corner.</TE>
<TE>   It all looked so perfect to Frankie Allen, the poor boy who lived
a dirt clod's throw away. He and Patricia fell in love, as much as
16-year-olds could, and she got pregnant. Everything her mother had
done was aimed at raising children different than the rest. And now
her daughter had become her worst nightmare, a teenage mother forced
into marriage.</TE>
<TE>   The marriage lasted barely a year. They separated even before
Frankie's depressed father shot his mother and turned the rifle on
himself in a ravine behind their shack. Patricia, with the help of
her mother, raised baby Phyllis at home.</TE>
<TE>   Now, it was 35 years later, and Patricia was back home again,
watching her mother--and an entire culture--fade. The cancer that had
retreated in summer was now growing into the brain. Mrs. Patterson
was lucid one moment and out there the next. She would start sobbing
for no apparent reason and then Patricia would figure it out: her
mind had floated back to 1990 and she was burying her husband.</TE>
<TE>   "She's in that bed, she can't walk and she can't
breathe," Patricia said. "But she just doesn't go, she won't let go.
She knows no other way."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was a little too hard. Tell Patricia I'm sorry. Tell her it's
getting dark outside and I want to go home. Get ready to leave this
place but can't find nobody to come get me. Don't have a car anymore.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Patricia knew this was the weekend--Memorial Day--when all the
children she grew up with would gather at the little park in Pixley
to reunite with brothers and sisters and friends long ago lost. She
wished she could go but tending to her mother had become an all-day
and all-night watch.</TE>
<TE>   The old gang had driven in from Los Angeles, South Pasadena, San
Diego, Oakland, Palo Alto, Sacramento and Klamath Falls. They came
back in shiny new cars, motor homes and even a limousine. The
Wrights, the Gorees, the Taylors, the Rodgers, the Hickses, the
Browns, the Barkuses and the Beavers. They were slow-cooking ribs and
chicken under big shade trees, drinking beers and telling on the
past.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's that getting out of that big machine?" asked Richard Hicks,
who had moved away to become a longshoreman in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "Why, that's my old squeeze, Barbara," Marvin Daniels said.</TE>
<TE>   "Barbara Crawford? Man, she was always full of fun. Lively and
very mischievous."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Crawford was now Barbara George. She left Pixley
after high school and settled in San Diego, where she married a
postal worker and got a job managing a hot dog stand at Qualcomm
Stadium. She hadn't been home in 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Who did you think I was?" she chided them. "We're the last of the
Mohicans."</TE>
<TE>   "We're all exiles," Hicks said, laughing. "After driving down to
where I used to live, I don't think I could handle it now. But back
then, I never second-guessed the old folks. We never knew a hungry
day. It wasn't steaks but my stomach was full."</TE>
<TE>   Frankie Allen and all his brothers and sisters were sprawled
around a concrete picnic table a few trees down.</TE>
<TE>   There was James who worked for Pac Bell and lived in Bakersfield;
Harry who went off to war in 1965 and came back a Muslim; Oletha who
lived in Tulare and never married the father of her four children.
She had become a Jehovah's Witness.</TE>
<TE>   There was Alfredia who lived in Los Angeles and married at 16 and
somehow made it work. Now she had a tumor in her brain; Betty who
survived a jealous boyfriend tracking her down in a cotton field and
shooting her in the head with a .38-caliber pistol. They put a plate
in her skull and she married, only to find herself falling back in
love with the man who shot her. They've been together now for almost
40 years.</TE>
<TE>   There was Evetta, whose husband had died at age 46 from sickle
cell anemia; Donnell, who drove a truck for Budweiser and had a hip
replacement; Harriese who was a single mother with four children,
three doing fine and one in Soledad; and Francine, the delicate,
beautiful one who retired from the gas company and just finished her
third marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Her twin brother, Frankie, who worked for the state
and never moved far from the old homestead, was standing off to the
side, a belly full of beer.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess you know that we lived across the street from the
Pattersons," he said. "They were the richest people in town. They
drove the best of cars and had only two kids. Mrs. Patterson ruled
with an iron fist. But I have to say that the woman had class. A big,
fat lady would come and give Patricia piano lessons. Who knew
anything about piano lessons in the alkali?</TE>
<TE>   "After Patricia got pregnant and I moved in, I remember reaching
into a loaf of bread one day and making a sandwich out of the end
piece. And her brother, Ken, came along behind me and asked what I
was doing. He said the end piece wasn't for eating. It was for
keeping the other pieces fresh. 'Man,' I thought, 'that's living.' In
my house it didn't matter whether you kept it fresh or not. Once it
was opened, the whole loaf, heel and all, was going to be eaten."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lord, what you waiting on? I fought the good fight and finished
the race. Ain't you got my place ready for me yet?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   She died at 4 in the morning on a Sunday in late September, a few
minutes after Patricia had gone into her room and swabbed her mouth
with cotton. She told her that she loved her and that it was time to
let go. "Just think, Momma, you'll be wearing a long white robe and a
crown, and if I know you, you're going to cock that crown just a
little acey-deucy to the right." The old lady smiled and then let go.</TE>
<TE>   In that moment, Patricia said she felt everything pass to her--the
crooked little house, the feckless five acres, the broken-down
community and the proud family name. Tulare didn't feel like home
anymore. Teviston did. And she was going to stay and straighten out
the house and maybe even try to straighten out the community. She
wasn't alone. A handful of other blacks--single mothers and families,
too, who had grown up and left here only to sour on the city--were
moving back.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm finding more and more that I just can't walk away and never
look back. This little piece of property belongs to the Pattersons
and enough of the old place remains that I'm willing to put up a
fight."</TE>
<TE>   The First Baptist Church of Pixley was packed for the funeral,
friends and relatives from all over the state and six preachers
representing four churches. They talked about all the right things,
how her life had been an example, how her example had touched them
all. The preacher told them to make the same choices she did. It's
all right to cry, he said. But don't cry as those without hope.
Because Minnie Pearl Patterson is going on home now. To a land of no
mores.</TE>

<HD>Income Drop in '90s Cut a Broad Swath, Data Show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE and ERIN CHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A broad decline in household income during the 1990s struck hard at
middle-class and upper-middle-class neighborhoods across Southern
California, part of a complex erosion triggered in part by the
collapse of the aerospace industry, according to census statistics
being released today.</LD>
<LD>   Although the effects were most pronounced in such places as Porter
Ranch, Hancock Park and Mission Viejo, there was no geographic
pattern to the declines. Household income dropped or stagnated in
thousands of neighborhoods from Upland to West Covina and Cerritos to
Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   By contrast, neighborhoods where incomes rose the most during the
'90s tended to be beach and upscale mountain enclaves, including
Manhattan Beach, Newport Beach and Temescal Canyon.</LD>
<TE>   The new data offer a more focused view of trends first depicted in
census numbers released in May. That data marked a general trend of
declining Southland household income amid the economic boom of the
'90s, part of a national widening gap between the wealthy and the
poor.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, for example, the median income dropped from
$45,600 in 1990 to $42,200 in 2000 when adjusted for inflation--a
stunning change from the previous two decades, when median income in
the county rose 3.5% in the '70s and 21.5% in the '80s. Median
household income fell across the Southland in every county except for
Ventura County, where it rose by a few hundred dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The data being released today by the Census Bureau will allow
demographers to track changes at the census-tract level--areas that
average 1,600 households. For example, the census data released in
May showed that 18% of Los Angeles County's residents live below the
federal poverty line. UCLA researchers said the new numbers more
clearly define that poverty: About 28% of Los Angeles County's census
tracts are "poor," meaning at least 25% of the tract population lives
below the poverty line. That was several times greater than the 5%
level in the Bay Area. The number of poor tracts grew in Los Angeles,
but remained the same for the Bay Area, the demographers said.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of economic decline portrayed in the new numbers is
manifold and reflects such broad social changes as the retirement of
the World War II generation and an influx of immigrants taking
low-wage jobs, said Dowell Myers, professor of urban planning and
demography at USC's School of Policy, Planning and Development.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No 'Fresh Replacements'</TE>
<TE>   "Over the decade, California did not get fresh replacements of
upper-middle-class new residents, and the state lost a lot of those,"
Myers said. "Those that stayed in place got poorer, and immigrants
came in at the bottom of the ladder. So everything worked to drop
average income."</TE>
<TE>   Myers also said some of the income shifts at the high end could be
skewed because of the way the census categorizes income, allowing the
wealthiest to list income ranges instead of actual income to preserve
privacy in lightly populated census tracts.</TE>
<TE>   In ranking census tracts, The Times compared only the 45% that did
not change boundaries from 1990 to 2000. The data are gleaned from
census "long forms," which were filled out by about 1 in 6 people
counted in Census 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The largest income gains went to households in Corona del Mar, a
bluff-top community at Newport Beach's southern edge, where median
household incomes rose $30,207, to $98,718.</TE>
<TE>   The other top-gaining census tracts were in Marina del Ray,
Manhattan Beach, Temescal Canyon and Coto de Caza, a gated
neighborhood in southern Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The disparate reasons for the region's overall decline in median
income intersected in Porter Ranch, where contiguous census tracts
north of the Ronald Reagan Freeway near Reseda Boulevard were ranked
2nd, 6th and 14th on the list of median-income losers. Another tract
just to the east, in Granada Hills, was ranked 10th.</TE>
<TE>   A prime factor: high-paying jobs that evaporated with the closing
of Lockheed Martin, General Motors and Hughes Aircraft Co. facilities
in the early 1990s, said Keith Myers, a Porter Ranch real estate
agent for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Real Estate Factors</TE>
<TE>   Also, real estate development during the decade was heavy on homes
in the $200,000-to-$300,000 range, while new developments now feature
$750,000 homes in gated communities, residents say.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Hunt, who has lived on Porter Ranch's Singing Hills Drive
since 1977, traces some of the decline to the aftermath of the 1994
Northridge earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just an ugly place to be," Hunt said. As fear of more
quakes led some people to move out, real estate values tumbled,
opening the door for families who couldn't otherwise afford to live
there.</TE>
<TE>   "That Spanish colonial," Hunt said, pointing down the street, "was
sold to a real estate agent for $146,000.... It's probably in the
$400,000s by now."</TE>
<TE>   Hunt, 63, is part of the downward trend himself. He and his wife,
Lois, 66, retired from teaching in the '90s and now receive about
$25,000 a year less in income. But the drop is relative: Hunt still
has enough money to fix up a 1952 silver MG, build model helicopters
and ride a Yamaha scooter. And his wife drives a Lexus.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the drop can be attributed to families whose businesses
did not soar during the '90s, said Joe Johnson, a Porter Ranch
resident and former owner of Liberty Bell Sales, a manufacturer's
representative firm.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson and his wife at one point made $300,000 a year with the
business, but closed it two years ago when they concluded that many
of their clients wouldn't survive the current economic slowdown, he
said. Now, the couple earn less than $100,000 from government jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Other Porter Ranch entrepreneurs also suffered as their businesses
declined, he said, and several moved out. "They're definitely not
living as well as before," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Biggest Drop in Newport</TE>
<TE>   The largest drop in household income occurred in Newport Beach's
Lido Isle, a man-made island of multimillion-dollar homes nestled
among yachts and other pleasure craft in Newport Bay. There,
household income dropped by $34,735--slightly more than the starting
salary for a teacher in a large school district--to $103,691.</TE>
<TE>   The income drop caught some islanders by surprise. Longtime
resident Judy Franco said it might be due to an influx of people
retiring to what once were their summer homes.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't noticed any lifestyle changes," said Franco, a former
teacher who moved to the island in 1968. "The houses have gotten
bigger."</TE>
<TE>   Another possible cause: Increases in maids and other in-residence
servants who count as separate households, and whose wages would
weigh down the island average.</TE>

<HD>Slain Teen Informant's Kin Settle for $1 Million</HD>
<DH>Crime: Brea and Yorba Linda will pay to end a lawsuit that
said police should have protected the boy murdered by drug dealers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cities of Brea and Yorba Linda agreed Monday to pay $1 million to
the family of a 17-year-old boy who was beaten and strangled by drug
dealers in 1998 after working as an undercover drug informant.</LD>
<LD>   Chad MacDonald's death prompted nationwide scrutiny of the use of
juveniles as police informants and sparked a state law that
restricted the practice. Some police departments feared that a
victory for the family would make using teenage informants too great
a legal liability.</LD>
<LD>   Law enforcement officials on Monday said the settlement will
probably lead to more aggressive training for police who deal with
teenagers. But they said the use of juvenile informants, while still
infrequent compared with use of adults, will probably continue.</LD>
<TE>   "I am sure each city attorney and risk management [office] is
going to look at this to determine a response," said Fremont Police
Chief Craig Steckler, past president of the California Police Chiefs
Assn. "But you have to remember that informants are our lifeblood,
and I don't think that's going to change."</TE>
<TE>   Brea police arrested MacDonald in January 1998 after finding half
an ounce of methamphetamine in his pickup during a traffic stop in
Yorba Linda. (Brea officers patrol Yorba Linda under a contract.)</TE>
<TE>   That night at Brea police headquarters, MacDonald agreed to
cooperate with future drug investigations; his mother signed a waiver
authorizing his role.</TE>
<TE>   The teenager made one undercover drug buy while wearing a hidden
recording device and told police about two other suspected drug
dealers.</TE>
<TE>   When officers arrested him a second time with methamphetamine,
Brea police booted him from the informant program and told him he
would be charged.</TE>
<TE>   Less than two weeks later, MacDonald was robbed and killed at a
Norwalk drug house. His teenage girlfriend, who accompanied him to
the house, was raped, shot in the face and abandoned near the Angeles
National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   The assailants, who were gang members, were convicted and
sentenced to life in prison without parole for the crimes against
MacDonald and his girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, the defense argued that the three suspects
determined that MacDonald was an informant and were trying to teach
him a lesson when he accidentally died.</TE>
<TE>   The MacDonald family lawyer, Lloyd Charton, argued that Brea
police were responsible for MacDonald's death because the gang
members killed him as retaliation for the teenager's informant work.
Charton also charged the police did not do enough to protect
MacDonald.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement Monday marked one of the largest police department
payouts in Orange County history and came about a month after a state
appeals court reinstated the family's lawsuit. A lower court had
earlier thrown out the case, finding that police were protected by
the waiver MacDonald's mother signed.</TE>
<TE>   Brea police have long insisted they did nothing improper, noting
that MacDonald was acting without their knowledge when he drove to
the Norwalk house.</TE>
<TE>   But after more than three years of litigation and hundreds of
thousands in legal bills, the city's insurance carrier decided the
settlement made the most financial sense, said Brea City Manager Tim
O'Donnell.</TE>
<TE>   MacDonald's mother, Cindy, said the settlement sends a strong
message about the danger of police using teenagers as their agents.
She said she hopes the lawsuit settlement and the new law, which
requires a judge's approval before a juvenile can work as an
informant, make police think twice.</TE>
<TE>   "If Chad's life saves another child, which I know that it has,
then he meant something," Cindy MacDonald said. "My goal was for this
to never happen to another child again. Hopefully, it won't."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry L. Steering, an attorney who represents plaintiffs in police
misconduct cases, said police throughout the state should take notice
of the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "The cops should know better than having a 17-year-old wearing a
wire," Steering said. "He's not even allowed to buy beer or a
cigarette."</TE>
<TE>   The family decided four years ago that they would settle for
nothing less than $1 million--a figure they believed would send a
message to police throughout the state, Charton said.</TE>
<TE>   "This will have a huge impact," Charton said. "Any time a police
officer reads that another police department had to pay out $1
million, they will think seriously before they engage in those acts.
Aren't we all supposed to learn from our mistakes?"</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after all sides agreed to the settlement, Cindy MacDonald
drove to Fairhaven Memorial Park in Santa Ana on Monday to visit her
son's crypt.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm telling him how good he did ... and how his life touched
others," she said.</TE>

<HD>Courts Face Closures, Job Cuts</HD>
<DH>County: Hundreds of employees could get layoff notices amid
plans to close 29 courtrooms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To cope with an anticipated $57-million shortfall, Los Angeles County
Superior Court plans to cut hundreds of jobs and may close 29
courtrooms across the county, according to documents and interviews
with court officials.</LD>
<LD>   Layoff notices to 168 employees, mostly clerical staff, could go
out as early as this week, with plans ultimately to eliminate 368
positions. The remaining 200 slots are already vacant because of
attrition.</LD>
<LD>   Scrambling to reduce expenditures by almost 10%, the Superior
Court imposed a hiring freeze earlier this summer and is now
considering reducing funding for courthouse security and ending the
use of retired judges. Funding for popular programs such as Drug
Court also could be in jeopardy.</LD>
<TE>   The largest court system in California, Los Angeles County has
about 600 courtrooms, 613 judicial officers and 5,800 employees.
Other counties throughout the state will have to adjust to similar
cuts, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "The security for the public and for the individuals that work in
all the courthouses is of paramount concern and will not be
compromised," said Judge Dan Oki, who supervises criminal courts in
Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Oki said he could not comment on details. Others in the justice
system expressed concern.</TE>
<TE>   "When cuts of that magnitude are executed, the concern would be
that the justice process would be delayed or compromised," said
County Public Defender Mike Judge.</TE>
<TE>   According to a confidential document obtained by The Times, if the
court closed 29 courtrooms, it would no longer need the bailiffs or
retired judges, traditionally used to ease case overloads and fill
vacancies.</TE>
<TE>   "These are real numbers that require serious deliberation. Our
objective is that, regardless of the size of the cuts, the judges
will come up with a plan that leaves us with a fully functioning
court system, Assistant Presiding Judge Robert A. Dukes said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Court officials said the shortfall stems from increased
expenditures and a reduction in state funding. Los Angeles County
Superior Court is expected to receive about $20 million less than
expected from the state for the 2002-03 fiscal year, said Executive
Officer John A. Clarke.</TE>
<TE>   Other trial-level courts throughout the state are expected to face
similar deficits because of the downturn in the economy and the
governor's budget recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the 900-pound gorilla in the court system," said Los
Angeles County court spokesman Allan Parachini. "It's showing up here
because we have the largest and most complex organization. We're
certain that this is a problem that is going to sweep through the
court system of California."</TE>
<TE>   The Judicial Council of California warned courts last week that
they face a 3.7% reduction in their current spending. In a memo, the
council noted that some trial courts may be able to absorb the
reduction, while others would have to restrict hiring, renegotiate
contracts and maintain vacancies. The budget for California trial
courts could be reduced by as much as $148 million out of a total
budget of $2.5 billion, according to the Judicial Council.</TE>
<TE>   "The courts are definitely taking a hit," said Lynn Holton, a
Judicial Council spokeswoman. "We've heard from several courts who
are concerned about their budgets for next year. We've already taken
millions of dollars off the table and we have already made sacrifices
in the courts."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court has an annual budget of about
$600 million--98% from the state and 2% from fees and grants. The
county maintains the court facilities, but does not fund operations.</TE>
<TE>   Other than the expected reduction in state funds, Deputy Executive
Officer Bill Mitchell said the deficit is due to increased
expenditures, such as staff for the new Chatsworth courthouse. The
court also hired 81 contract court reporters as permanent employees
and promoted juvenile traffic hearing officers to referees.</TE>
<TE>   The judges proposed cutting 5.7% of the workforce by taking
several steps, including eliminating vacant positions, firing
probationary office assistants and clerical workers, discontinuing
the use of retirees and laying off trainee clerks hired after Feb. 4.
The court administration stressed in its documents that it plans to
honor negotiated salary increases and promotions.</TE>
<TE>   The budget committee expects to make final decisions within 30
days, after receiving feedback on the recommendations. If no
decisions are made until November, an additional 70 total positions
could be slashed, according to the confidential documents. And if no
action is taken until January, the deficit could cause the
elimination of 157 more positions.</TE>
<TE>   Judges and administrators are beginning to assess the effect on
courthouse safety, judges' caseload and public access to the courts.
The court is looking to cut about $10 million of its total $100
million spending on security, Clarke said. That could be accomplished
by closing some lockups and transferring those criminal cases to
other courthouses.</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said he believes the Superior Court could
save some money by allowing county and court employees to bypass
metal detectors at courthouse entrances. "It's been security
overkill, and they ought to look hard at cutting back," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Executive Officer Clark said the forecast for the future is just
as dim.</TE>
<TE>   "We're anticipating next year to be as bad or worse than this
year," he said.</TE>

<HD>Court Upholds Death Penalty in Murders</HD>
<DH>Justice: Majority says defendant's difficult childhood and
prison abuse, not revealed at trial, would not have changed jury's
decision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The California Supreme Court upheld a death sentence for a Los
Angeles man Monday even though his defense lawyer failed to call a
single witness in the sentencing portion of his trial.</LD>
<LD>   The state high court decided 5 to 2 that evidence of the
defendant's tragic childhood and abuse in racist Alabama prisons
would not have been enough to convince a jury to fix punishment at
life imprisonment instead of death for triple murder.</LD>
<LD>   Records of the trial contain "no indication the jury was inclined
to sentence [Jesse James Andrews] to life imprisonment," Justice
Janice Rogers Brown wrote for the court.</LD>
<TE>   Justices Joyce L. Kennard and Carlos Moreno dissented, arguing
that a jury might have voted for life had it been told of Andrews'
time in brutal and racist penal institutions in the South, including
prisons later found to impose cruel and unusual punishment and
juvenile facilities likened to slave camps.</TE>
<TE>   Andrews' "attorneys did virtually no penalty phase preparation,"
Kennard wrote. "They presented no expert witnesses. Nor did they ask
their investigators to do any work on the penalty phase."</TE>
<TE>   Troubled by that failure, the state high court appointed Los
Angeles Superior Court Judge Jacqueline A. Connor in 1990 to examine
the kind of evidence that could have been presented by the defense
and prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Based on Connor's findings, the state high court said defense
lawyer Gerald Lenoir, assisted by Halvor Miller, presented a
"reasonable case" for sparing Andrews' life.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of mitigating evidence made it unnecessary for the
prosecution to introduce damaging testimony that would have depicted
Andrews as "aggressive and desensitized to violence," Brown wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Counsel here did perform some background investigation, including
an interview with petitioner's mother despite his objection," Brown
wrote, "after which they pursed a different penalty defense."</TE>
<TE>   Andrews was convicted of murdering two men and one woman during a
drug-related robbery in Los Angeles in 1979. He also raped and
sodomized his female victim. After jurors found him guilty of the
crimes, they were asked to determine whether he should be sentenced
to life or death.</TE>
<TE>   The defense team during the penalty phase argued that Andrews was
"a follower rather than violently antisocial" and urged the jury to
consider the fact that "others who had committed more heinous
multiple murders had been sentenced to life without the possibility
of parole," the court majority said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the evidence not presented was that Andrews was born in 1950
to alcoholic parents who separated after his birth. He and two
siblings were left in the care of their grandparents and an aunt, who
lived in a poor, segregated neighborhood in Mobile, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   In 1964, when he was 14, Andrews was convicted of joy riding and
sent to the Alabama Industrial School for Negro Children, which a
federal judge described as a "penal colony for children" and a
juvenile probation officer called a "slave camp for children,"
according to evidence presented to the referee.</TE>
<TE>   The children suffered sexual abuse, were beaten regularly and put
to work picking cotton and tending vegetables, the evidence showed.</TE>
<TE>   Three months after he was released from the reform school, Andrews
and a friend robbed a grocery store clerk. His friend shot and killed
the clerk. While fleeing, they robbed a taxi driver. Andrews was
convicted of murder and robbery and went to prison in Alabama at 16.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions in Alabama's prisons at the time were later determined
by a court to violate the Constitution's prohibition against cruel
and unusual punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Andrews was sexually assaulted and beaten in prison. One of the
prisons where he was incarcerated had just been integrated when
Andrews arrived, and the white guards resented the black inmates.
Prisoners learned to live in a constant state of tension and carried
knives in full view of prison guards, the referee found.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, writing for the majority, said that even if defense lawyers
had investigated Andrews' family background more intently, the facts
would not have persuaded the jury to be more lenient.</TE>
<TE>   "The testimony describing his upbringing and early family life
generally showed it to be relatively stable and without privation and
abuse," Brown wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "All but one of his siblings completed high school, and only one
had a minor brush with the law," Brown observed.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging that Andrews had experienced "horrifically demeaning
and degrading" treatment, the court said testimony about that part of
his life would have opened the door to evidence of Andrews' own
violent conduct in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than engendering sympathy, the evidence could well have
reinforced an impression of him as a person who had become
desensitized and inured to violence and disrespect for the law,"
Brown wrote.</TE>
<TE>   But Kennard said Andrews' lawyers pursued a "disastrous strategy"
and argued that the evidence of Andrews' sufferings as a boy might
have prevented his death sentence.</TE>

<HD>Missing Boy Found With Wrong Class</HD>
<DH>Safety: The 4-year-old, confused on his first day at
school, was feared a kidnap victim and became the subject of a police
search.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The parents of 4-year-old Salvador Delgado believed for several
heart-pounding hours Monday that their little boy had become the
latest statistic in a summer marked by a string of high-profile
kidnappings.</LD>
<LD>   The kindergartener was attending his first day at Wadsworth Avenue
Elementary School, just southeast of downtown Los Angeles. But when
his mother stopped by his classroom, she didn't see her son,
Principal Cynthia Williams said.</LD>
<LD>   Administrators searched the school and called the boy's name over
the public address system, but he did not respond. At 9 a.m., police
were called.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Department's Newton Division set up a
six-square-block perimeter. Officials dispatched a helicopter, 30
officers and a team of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department search
dogs to look for the boy, said LAPD Officer Jack Richter.</TE>
<TE>   Without witnesses to corroborate a kidnapping, police held off
issuing an Amber alert, named after Amber Hagerman, a 9-year-old from
Texas who was abducted and killed in 1996. Police transmit
information about missing children to other law enforcement agencies
and the media, as well as on electronic freeway signs.</TE>
<TE>   The system, new to California, received attention after being used
in the kidnappings earlier this month of two teenage girls from the
Antelope Valley and in the disappearance of Jessica Cortez, 4, of
Echo Park.</TE>
<TE>   Around lunchtime, Salvador was spotted close to where he had last
been seen--near the cafeteria among the upper-grade students.</TE>
<TE>   The relieved parents, Ezeikel and Mercedes Lopez of Los Angeles,
threw their arms around their son and asked where he had been.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me he was outside and a teacher told him to get in the
back of the line, so he got in the back of the line," Mercedes Lopez
said.</TE>
<TE>   When school started, Salvador, who is tall for his age, had
accidentally lined up with fourth graders and was marched off to
their class, school officials said.</TE>

<HD>5,800 Stories Behind Cathedral Donations</HD>
<DH>Religion: Contributions large and small will make the
people who gave the money part of the future of the Catholic church
and Los Angeles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The money to build the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels came
by way of love, memory, faith and civic pride.</LD>
<LD>   A retired contractor remembered boyhood visits in the 1930s to a
doughnut shop across the street from old St. Vibiana's Cathedral at
2nd and Main streets.</LD>
<LD>   A woman thought of her mother's ashes interred far away on
property overlooking Puget Sound that was once the family home but
had since been sold.</LD>
<TE>   Another woman, standing on a pivot of time between the past and
the future, looked back to a family history of five generations in
the church and then five generations ahead. Her family wants its
heirs to worship in the beauty of a cathedral they had helped build.</TE>
<TE>   There are at least 5,800 such stories, one for each donor to the
$200-million cathedral and conference center, which will be dedicated
Monday. Like those who built the great medieval cathedrals of
Europe--the peasants and bourgeois, the noblemen and kings--their
stories are as different as their stations in life. Six hundred of
them donated more than $10,000 each. Some gave millions. But most
gave $50 or $100. What links them is an idea and a building made to
stand at least 500 years as a testament to their faith in God or
hopes for the city.</TE>
<TE>   In the center of the fund-raising has been Cardinal Roger M.
Mahony, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Los Angeles. It was Mahony,
encouraged by an unexpected gift of $25 million from the Dan Murphy
Foundation, who embarked upon the historic cathedral-building project
first envisioned by bishop Thomas J. Conaty in 1904.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony recalls that he was approached by Sir Daniel Donohue, head
of the Dan Murphy Foundation, just before Mahony was to ordain three
new auxiliary bishops at St. Vibiana's Cathedral on March 19, 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The old cathedral had been severely shaken two months earlier by
the Northridge earthquake, and jagged fissures ran up the venerable
old bell tower like varicose veins on an aging lady.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony wined and dined major donors--from hosting a one-on-one
lunch with an individual or couple, to small intimate dinners of half
a dozen or so couples at someone's home to larger gatherings.
Meanwhile, Catholic parishioners across the three-county archdiocese
were invited to contribute from $50 to $5,000 to buy 15,000 paving
stones for the cathedral floor in their names or in memory of loved
ones. To date, $1.5 million has been raised this way.</TE>
<TE>   By 1998, nearly 100 contributors had given $110 million. By the
end of the campaign, 60% of the money raised came from large and
small individual contributions, 3% from corporate contributions, and
37% from corporate and family foundations, the archdiocese said
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Not all were Christians. A Jewish couple in New York agreed to
contribute $2.5 million for a water fountain commemorating
Catholic-Jewish relations. Just days after their pledge, the husband
died. Their names will not be announced until next week, when his
widow attends the dedication.</TE>
<TE>   Others, like Philip and Gloria Holcomb of Claremont, who are
Catholic converts and retired teachers, spoke of religious
conviction. They gave $50 for a paving stone after a tour of the
cathedral. "We just looked at each other and said, let's do it." The
Holcombs will not be at the gala dinner for major donors after the
dedication. But they feel no less a part, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at that place and it's going to be there forever as a
monument to God," Gloria Holcomb said. "It's not just like you think
only in terms of the next generation. It will give people a real
sense of peace, a real sense of what we're all a part of, and, I
think, in terms of just being here on Earth, why we're here."</TE>
<TE>   Suzanne Tito of Bel-Air remembers her late mother, Jane Bergbower.
"You know," she said, "her faith just got her through so much. It
kept her grounded.... She always was concerned about others, a very
selfless person. She had a wonderful laugh."</TE>
<TE>   When her mother died several years ago, her cremated remains were
placed in the backyard of her home, with its view of Puget Sound in
Washington state. Later, the property was sold. Tito, an art history
major, had long admired the portals in cathedrals she had visited
around the world. In her mother's memory, she contributed for a
stained glass "Holy Spirit" window in the cathedral mausoleum beneath
the floor of the nave and sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   "She would have loved it if she would be alive to be here today,"
Tito said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a fallen away Catholic but I feel like a Catholic," she
confessed with a laugh. "Once you're a Catholic, you're always a
Catholic."</TE>
<TE>   For Kathleen Hannon Aikenhead, the church has been a thread of
continuity woven through the history of her family for five
generations. The family helped spread the word of Father Junipero
Serra, founder of the California missions. For 20 years the William
H. Hannon Foundation has given to the church and the work of its
schools and hospitals. And it is donating $1 million to the cathedral
for a future mural depicting Father Serra.</TE>
<TE>   "The way we looked at it," said Aikenhead, president of the
foundation, "the next five generations would be able to worship and
enjoy the beautiful new cathedral."</TE>
<TE>   For Mark Foster, president of the Los Angeles Master Chorale and
managing director of the Seidler Family Office, which manages
investments for wealthy individuals, a cathedral has a role as a
patron of music and the arts. That's in part why he gave $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the greatest musical performances I've ever heard took
place in the cathedral in Segovia, Spain. I will always remember
that. It wasn't just the music, but the setting, the space in which
it took place."</TE>
<TE>   The donor who once thought about going to church as a chance to
have a doughnut is now 73 years old. His name is Edward M. Illig. He
is a retired contractor who lives in La Canada-Flintridge. His
parents, Joseph and Katherine Illig, immigrated to the U.S. in 1910
from Alsace-Lorraine. They came to Los Angeles in 1914. Katherine was
a short woman with broad shoulders. As long as Edward could remember,
his mother had gray hair. They lived on a hill southeast of the
Silver Lake reservoir.</TE>
<TE>   When Edward was 3 or 4, his mother would take him by the hand and
they would walk down Benton Way to Sunset Boulevard to catch the Red
Car to downtown's old subway terminal building. From there they would
walk to St. Vibiana's Cathedral for Stations of the Cross during
Lent, or for novena prayers.</TE>
<TE>   "Afterward we'd go across the street to Cooper's Doughnuts and
she'd buy me a doughnut," Illig said. "Then we'd walk over to Central
Market and she'd buy a few things. She'd pick up fresh oysters and
she'd fix oyster soup on Friday nights."</TE>
<TE>   Illig followed developments closely for eight years as the fate of
St. Vibiana's was decided. When the cardinal asked him to consider a
donation, Illig said he and his wife, Marjorie, had already made up
their minds. The man appreciated his mother's devotion in a way the
boy could not.</TE>
<TE>   "You support those things that are good, right and proper," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   And that was why the Illigs gave $100,000 to have his parents'
names, and that of his late brother and Paulist priest, Alvin,
inscribed on the cathedral's donor wall.</TE>

<HD>AIDS Ride Founder Lays Off L.A. Staff</HD>
<DH>Charity: Future of Pallotta TeamWorks, also organizer of
breast cancer walks, is in limbo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fate of a fund-raising company that pioneered the AIDS bike ride
and three-day breast cancer walks remained up in the air Monday after
the Los Angeles-based firm closed its doors.</LD>
<LD>   Pallotta TeamWorks announced over the weekend that it was
suspending operations and laying off 250 employees. The shutdown
followed months of wrangling between the company and sponsors of
events it stages over the cost of the fund-raisers.</LD>
<LD>   Dan Pallotta, who revolutionized charity moneymaking by creating
the first AIDS benefit bicycle ride in 1994, told workers that a trio
of three-day walks to raise money for breast cancer research
scheduled for later this year will continue.</LD>
<TE>   And some of the laid-off fund-raisers may be rehired, said company
spokeswoman Janna Sidley, who was among those laid off.</TE>
<TE>   "We were furloughed. Their intention is to continue the season and
bring us back," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the Avon Foundation, a public charity that allocates
funds raised by the breast cancer walks, sought Monday to assure
participants that October events scheduled for Los Angeles, New York
and Atlanta will go on as planned. Three-day walks have already been
completed in 10 other cities this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Avon looks forward to TeamWorks' full cooperation and shared
determination to make the remaining three 2002 events safe and
successful for all participants," said Kathleen Walas, president of
the Avon Foundation, which has raised some $235 million for breast
cancer causes since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Pallotta TeamWorks executives did not return telephone calls
Monday. Earlier, Sidley told Associated Press that the furloughs were
designed to save money and to ensure that events the firm organizes
go on as planned.</TE>
<TE>   The for-profit company's strategy of staging weeklong bike rides
between such places as San Francisco and Los Angeles has been heavily
criticized in recent years by some AIDS activists who contended that
Pallotta TeamWorks' overhead was too high.</TE>
<TE>   About 52% of the $11 million raised in the 2001 AIDS Ride went to
the Los Angeles Gay &amp; Lesbian Center and the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation. In earlier years, about 35 cents of every dollar
contributed by riders' individual sponsors was used to stage the
event. Last year's 2,300 riders each paid an $85 entry fee and then
contributed a minimum of $2,700 in donations to take part.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, the Gay &amp; Lesbian Center and the AIDS Foundation
announced they were severing ties with Pallotta and would conduct
their own AIDS/LifeCycle ride this year.</TE>
<TE>   Pallotta promptly picked a major new beneficiary, AIDS Project Los
Angeles, and sued his new competitors to stop them. But a Superior
Court judge ruled in January that the rival fund-raiser could take
place.</TE>
<TE>   In May, about $4.4 million was raised by 670 riders in the
AIDS/LifeCycle Ride. A month later, 715 AIDS Ride participants raised
$2.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco-Los Angeles flap wasn't the only bump in the
bike-ride road experienced this year by Pallotta--who contends that
his events have netted $222 million for AIDS and breast cancer
organizations over the last nine years.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Pallotta TeamWorks announced that it was ending its
production of the annual "Heartland AIDS Ride" between Minnesota's
Twin Cities and Chicago after seven years. Three major beneficiaries
of that annual event, which attracted 1,100 riders, said they planned
to stage their own fund-raising events.</TE>
<TE>   Critics complained that Pallotta's firm was charging too much to
organize and run the often-emotional bike rides. They also said that
Pallotta did too much "cross-promotion" of breast cancer walks and
other company events during the bike rides.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, for the people who lost their jobs, it's a sad day,"
said Michael Weinstein, head of Hollywood-based AIDS Healthcare
Foundation, which is not involved with either of the bike rides.</TE>
<TE>   "But in bigger terms, what was lost the last couple of years was a
degree of innocence on the part of donors and participants in these
events. There not only needs to be greater scrutiny of nonprofit
organizations, but also for-profit fund-raisers."</TE>
<TE>   More angry was Wayne Turner of the Washington, D.C., chapter of
the AIDS activist group Act Up, who condemned results of this year's
AIDS Ride there. Expenses ate up at least 86% of the $3.6 million
raised, the Washington Post reported today.</TE>
<TE>   If riders hadn't raised much more than the minimum required, the
event might even have lost money, according to the Post.</TE>
<TE>   "People are beginning to wake up to the fact these AIDS rides are
not about raising money at all. They are all about building Dan
Pallotta's empire, which is now crumbling," Turner said.</TE>

<HD>Budget Dawdlers Are Fit to Be Cuffed</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Anybody know where I can get a whole bag of those plastic handcuffs,
cheap? The ones that look like garbage bag ties, that cops use when
they arrest a load of protesters?</LD>
<LD>   Because I'm thinking about flying up to Sacramento and walking
onto the floor of the state Assembly and making about 80 citizen's
arrests.</LD>
<LD>   The citizen would be me. The arrestees would be the entire state
Assembly, which is now nearly two months over the July 1
constitutional deadline on passing a budget.</LD>
<TE>   I don't know whether violating the state Constitution is a
criminal offense. If it is, is it a misdemeanor or a felony? Or just
an infraction, like possessing a teeny bit of marijuana, in which
case the cops would only have to write up 80 tickets instead of
snapping 80 mug shots and inking 800 fingerprints.</TE>
<TE>   A citizen's arrest is my second choice to get the Assembly off its
budget duff (the Senate passed a budget back in June, the
brown-nosers).</TE>
<TE>   My first choice would be to do what some really peeved Catholics
did about 700 years ago. The conclave of cardinals was meeting to
elect a new pope, and it hemmed and it hawed and it dithered--this
went on for months.</TE>
<TE>   So the good Catholics outside first cut off the wine deliveries to
the princes of the church. Then they cut off food and water. At last
they removed the roof to get them to hurry it up in there.</TE>
<TE>   Think that'd work? Cut off the pizza deliveries, switch off the
AC, turn off the toilets and see how fast things would get done.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Bakersfield Californian had a nifty story about one of those
slick pieces of business that makes people think of politicians ...
well, the way that people think about politicians.</TE>
<TE>   The story said that some Assembly members scooted back to
Sacramento on Sunday evening, July 7, just to punch the clock so they
could get an additional $484 each in per-diem money. That's four days
of their living-expense allowance for bunking in Sacramento much of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   The Fourth fell on a Thursday, making for an unusually long
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The rules say that if the Legislature is out of session for more
than three days, legislators can't collect that $121 per day; by
checking back into the Capitol before Sunday's midnight witching
hour, a legislator could get the most out of the four-day
holiday--hit a few patriotic civic barbecues, make a few stirring
speeches about America and service--and still collect some
substantial simoleons.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they won't be seeing that money for a while. Kathleen
Connell, the state controller, has cut off paychecks to elected
officials, including herself and the governor, until a budget is
passed. (This wouldn't really hurt some of them; Gov. Davis could
subsist on fund-raising dinners.)</TE>
<TE>   When those checks do show up in the mail, I suggest the midnight
clockers patriotically hand over their Fourth of July share to
charities that help some of the people who've been hurting since no
budget has meant no money for them:</TE>
<TE>   People trying to enroll in college on state grants are hurting.
Disabled people are hurting. Some old people are hurting. Some blind
people are hurting. Some blind people's guide dogs are hurting.</TE>
<TE>   People begin to wonder: If California can't get its act together
to meet a budget, why should they? If California isn't spending their
tax money where it should be, why should they bother paying it?</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago this summer, when the Legislature was sitting for so
long on an overdue budget that you thought they were trying to hatch
it, a Sacramento country and western station staged a "Dog Aid"
benefit for guide and companion dogs who, like their owners, weren't
getting their support checks.</TE>
<TE>   But because of privacy rules, the radio station couldn't find out
who the needy were. OK, fine; it gave un-addressed stamped envelopes
to the proper agency so it could tell the needy where they could pick
up the dog food. But even worse--get this--the state's legal services
people fussed over whether the disabled people might find their
benefits docked for "outside income"--the free dog food.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In truth, very serious things are at stake, or legislators
wouldn't keep themselves in lockdown in Sacramento's three-digit
summer. From the footloose and flush days of surpluses, there's now a
$23.6-billion budget hole.</TE>
<TE>   The largely Democratic-crafted budget has both cuts and tax hikes,
and Republicans oppose any tax increases at all, lest some future
challenger points an outraged finger to "my tax-and-spend opponent,"
even if the higher tax were on some sinful substance like devil-weed
tobacco.</TE>
<TE>   The budget would raise the cigarette tax from 87 cents to $3 a
pack (New York City just hoisted its from 8 cents to $1.50 a pack.)
Another measure to raise the smoking age from 18 to 21 dragged its
butts through committees, partly because it would mean a lot of lost
revenue from the young, dumb and free-spending--and partly, I
suspect, because as awful as making budget cuts is, it's nothing
compared with the prospect of creating bands of cold-turkey,
nicotine-deprived teenagers who have finally found something worth
voting for--or against.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Appeals Court Upholds Death Penalty in Stabbing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bucking a recent trend of reversals, a federal appeals court on
Monday upheld the death sentence for a California man convicted of
fatally stabbing a Stockton motel manager in 1980.</LD>
<LD>   In recent months, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which
covers nine Western states and is considered to be the most liberal
federal appellate group in the country, has issued 10 rulings that
either reversed a death sentence or upheld the decision of a federal
trial judge who had reversed a death sentence. Nine of the cases were
from California.</LD>
<LD>   But on Monday, a three-judge panel for the circuit upheld the
state Supreme Court's decision to confirm the death sentence for
Blufford Hayes Jr., who sought to overturn the death sentence partly
by arguing that he received ineffective counsel during the penalty
phase of his trial.</LD>
<TE>   Hayes was convicted in the Jan. 1, 1980, stabbing of Vinod "Pete"
Patel, who was found dead on the floor of a motel room bathroom with
his hands and feet bound with a wire coat hanger. Prosecutors said
Hayes enticed Patel to the room to rob him and stabbed him 22 times
with a hunting knife.</TE>
<TE>   Through his current lawyer, David A. Senior, Hayes argued that
former attorney Leonard Tauman failed to offer evidence on his family
background. Hayes acknowledged that he forbade Tauman to call family
members to testify on his behalf.</TE>
<TE>   In the ruling written by appellate Justice Diarmuid F.
O'Scannlain, the three-judge panel said that Tauman had acted
properly by agreeing with Hayes' wishes.</TE>
<TE>   Senior disagreed, saying: "There is a substantial difference
between not wanting your family involved to testify on your behalf
versus presenting evidence from other sources that are available
about one's family."</TE>

<HD>Davis OKs County Control of South Gate Voting</HD>
<DH>Politics: City officials must yield authority after charges
of hindering a recall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis on Monday signed urgency legislation forcing South
Gate to hand over control of its special elections to the county.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, which the Legislature passed unanimously, addresses
concerns of Latino leaders and Secretary of State Bill Jones that
city officials have thwarted a voter recall drive.</LD>
<LD>   "It was an unsettling picture of local politicians and alleged
election abuses," Davis spokesman Russ Lopez said of conditions in
South Gate. "This bill had substantial support from a lot of
different legislators and area leaders, and the governor agreed that
something needs to be done."</LD>
<TE>   Treasurer Albert Robles and his three council allies drew
criticism for replacing the elected city clerk with their own
appointee after residents launched a recall drive last year.</TE>
<TE>   Jones has accused the appointee, Julia Sylva, of manipulating the
electoral process. He also said an arson attack on the business of a
recall proponent and an unsolved shooting have created an atmosphere
of voter intimidation. The unusual legislation was introduced after
the city defied Jones' order to let the county run its special
elections.</TE>
<TE>   "State government is exactly in sync as far as protecting the
integrity of the recall election process in the city of South Gate,"
said William Wood, chief counsel for the secretary of state.</TE>
<TE>   City officials have denied charges of electoral manipulation and
call the state action an infringement on local politics.</TE>
<TE>   The law, which only applies to South Gate, requires any recall or
special election through 2003 to be administered by the Los Angeles
County Registrar-Recorder's Office.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Xochilt Ruvalcaba said Monday that the city has already
tried to let the county take over the special elections, and that the
county has so far refused. But county Registrar Conny McCormack said
her office is prepared to conduct the recall election if it proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   Residents have collected more than 8,000 signatures in the recall
drive against Robles, Ruvalcaba, Vice Mayor Raul Moriel and
Councilwoman Maria Benavides. They accuse the officials of
corruption, which the officials deny.</TE>
<TE>   To force an election, the signatures must be verified, but that
process stalled earlier this year after city officials threw out the
recall petitions, saying they were flawed.</TE>
<TE>   A Superior Court judge said the petitions were valid, but the city
has appealed. If an appeals court upholds the ruling, an election
could be held as early as December.</TE>
<TE>   "Without this legislation we didn't have any confidence that the
persons in charge of elections in South Gate would do anything to
move the ball forward, and in fact would do exactly the opposite, so
that the recall election would continue to be delayed," said Stephen
Kaufman, an attorney for the recall proponents.</TE>

<HD>Stayner Is Found Guilty of Murders</HD>
<DH>Crime: The first-degree verdicts under special
circumstances could bring the death penalty in the 1999 slayings of
three Yosemite tourists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury in San Jose convicted a motel handyman Monday of murdering
three Yosemite tourists, a crime that sent a wave of fear rippling
through the state's forested outback in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Cary Stayner, 41, could face the death penalty after being
convicted of slaying Carole Sund of Eureka, her 15-year-old daughter,
Juli, and Silvina Pelosso, 16, a family friend visiting from
Argentina.</LD>
<LD>   The jury returned its verdict after less than six hours of
deliberation over two days.</LD>
<TE>   They found Stayner guilty on three counts of first-degree murder,
a charge of kidnapping and five additional allegations that the
murders were committed during other felonies such as burglary and
attempted rape.</TE>
<TE>   Those special-circumstances verdicts make Stayner eligible for the
death penalty. But first, the jury will be asked to consider whether
Stayner was insane at the time of the killings.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers conceded that Stayner killed the three tourists.
But they said he was insane during the slayings and asked that he be
convicted of second-degree murder, which would keep him off San
Quentin's death row.</TE>
<TE>   Families of the victims expressed relief over the verdicts and
hope that the jury will determine that Stayner should be executed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an appropriate end to this terrible crime," said Carole
Carrington, whose daughter and granddaughter were slain. "He did such
unspeakable things to the girls."</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, Francis, said Stayner's methodical pursuit of his
victims undercuts arguments that he was insane and should be spared
death.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just too horrendous," he said, "for this to conclude in any
other way."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors used Stayner's statements to investigators as the
centerpiece of their case during the six-week trial.</TE>
<TE>   They played more than two hours of his taped confession, including
a chilling description of how he used the ruse of a leaking pipe to
get into the motel room of his victims.</TE>
<TE>   Stayner, who has pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, plugged
his ears with his fingers while the taped confession played.</TE>
<TE>   But the trial was dominated by psychiatric evidence, as defense
attorneys tried to convince jurors that Stayner hadn't developed the
forethought and intent needed to justify a first-degree murder
conviction.</TE>
<TE>   A parade of mental health professionals detailed a disturbing
childhood and family tree littered with cases of mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   The Sunds and Pelosso went missing in February 1999 from their
room at the rustic Cedar Lodge in El Portal, a tiny community nestled
in a valley outside Yosemite National Park.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest manhunts in state history ended four weeks
later and a county away when the torched hulk of their rental car was
discovered on a forest logging road with two of the women's charred
remains in the trunk.</TE>
<TE>   An anonymous note--Stayner later admitted to dispatching it, even
asking someone else to lick the stamp--led authorities a week later
to the shore of a nearby lake, where they found the nude body of Juli
Sund, her neck sliced open.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the FBI focused on a group of methamphetamine addicts
in Modesto, and by summer felt solid enough about the case to
publicly announce that it was safe again to return to the woods. That
backfired.</TE>
<TE>   Five months after the tourists went missing, Joie Ruth Armstrong,
26, became Stayner's fourth victim. Her beheaded body was found near
the Yosemite naturalist's cabin in a remote corner of the park in
July 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Within days of the gruesome killing, authorities caught up with
Stayner. He was charged with a federal crime because Armstrong's
murder took place in the national park. He pleaded guilty to avoid
the death penalty and received a life term in prison.</TE>
<TE>   But state prosecutors refused to budge in the case of the
tourists, which was tried in Superior Court because the killings
occurred outside the national park.</TE>
<TE>   Because of pretrial publicity in the Sierra foothills, the trial
was moved from Mariposa County to San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors took about seven days to lay out their case in
exhaustive physical detail, calling 30 witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   George Williamson, the lead prosecutor in the case, described
Stayner as a methodical killer who carefully hatched a plan to hunt
down young women like prey, sexually assault them and then kill.
Stayner, he noted, even left wet towels in the motel room to make it
look as if the three women had showered and left, hardly the moves of
a sullied mind.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, the defense team conceded from the beginning
that Stayner had killed the three tourists. But they focused on
Stayner's mental health.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Marcia Morrissey argued during the trial that
Stayner had kept his mental disorders in check for decades, but
eventually succumbed to inner demons in the months before the
Yosemite slayings. His mind, Morrissey said in court, had "broken
down."</TE>
<TE>   Psychiatrists who examined Stayner said he had experienced vivid
imagery of sex and violence since an early age. His family tree is
littered with relatives suffering from mental illnesses, including
depression and pedophilia, they argued.</TE>
<TE>   Events also helped propel Cary Stayner.</TE>
<TE>   His younger brother, Steven, was abducted at age 7 by a pedophile
and held as a sex slave for seven years before escaping with a young
boy. Steven Stayner later died in a motorcycle accident.</TE>
<TE>   As an adult, Stayner had a fixation with Bigfoot and the
apocalyptic prophesies of the 16th Century astrologer Nostradamus.
Stayner also repeatedly had nightmares of being pursued by
disembodied heads.</TE>
<TE>   Experts also testified that Stayner's brain may have been damaged
when his mother fell during a softball game while pregnant. Stayner,
they said, has a visibly misshapen head.</TE>
<TE>   One neuropsychiatrist testified that his brain was probably
damaged in a region that controls emotional impulses.</TE>
<TE>   Williamson countered during closing arguments that the mental
illness defense was an attempt to "blow smoke" and distract jurors
from overwhelming evidence.</TE>

<HD>Bill Seeks to Lighten Kids' Load</HD>
<DH>Books: Legislators say reducing the weight of texts would
save children's backs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON, JOE MATHEWS and DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To avoid creating a generation of hunchbacks, California legislators
are weighing a bill that is intended to make textbooks lighter and
reduce schoolchildren's backpack burden.</LD>
<LD>   Whether algebra books should be reduced from five pounds to three
and American history to a slimmer two, the bill's backers don't say.
They would leave those details to the State Board of Education.</LD>
<LD>   But some poundage reduction in texts is badly needed for children
dwarfed by their giant backpacks and afflicted with aching shoulders
and tingling fingers, according to Assemblyman Rod Pacheco
(R-Riverside), one of the bill's sponsors.</LD>
<TE>   Because many schools either don't have lockers or ban their use
because of security fears, lighter tomes are the solution, insists
Pacheco, who has seen three of his own children buckle under their
backpack loads.</TE>
<TE>   But any Weight Watchers regimen for books faces opposition from
publishers and skepticism from some parents and school
administrators. They argue that heavy backpacks--like any weight
problem--do not have a single solution, especially one as potentially
complicated and expensive as changing textbooks.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't make a ton of sense," says Greg Vallone, principal of
Monroe High School in North Hills. "I've been under the impression
that textbooks weigh what they weigh because someone who understands
curriculum has determined how much must be in them. How would you
change that?"</TE>
<TE>   Easily, countered Pacheco. "One simple way is to take the textbook
you have now and split it in two," he said, with one for the first
semester and the other for the second part of the year. The weight
regulations, he said, would not "affect content or substance at all."
And paperback books would help too, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Pacheco sponsored a bill that would have required
school districts to study the link between excessive backpack weight
and injuries. That bill was vetoed by Gov. Gray Davis, who said there
was not enough documentation to support the idea and that the issue
could be addressed locally.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Pacheco, along with state Sen. Jackie Speier
(D-Hillsborough) and Assemblyman Dario Frommer (D-Los Feliz), is
trying again. Armed with statistics from the Consumer Product Safety
Commission that say thousands of children each year land in emergency
rooms because of injuries from heavy backpacks, they want the State
Board of Education to set maximum weight standards for textbooks by
January 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, backed by the California Medical Assn., is currently on
the Senate floor and, if it passes there, will go back to the
Assembly for concurrence. The governor has not yet taken a position,
said spokesman Russ Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   A similar bill is being debated in the New Jersey Legislature. Its
sponsor, Democratic Assemblyman Peter Barnes, said he wants to alert
parents to the terrible dangers of heavy backpacks.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was in the Army many years ago, we carried everything on
our backs and some of these kids carry backpacks that appear to be
heavier," Barnes said.</TE>
<TE>   But some argue that much of the backpack bloat comes not from
heavy tomes, but from children's own appetite for gadgets, CD players
and cool clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "The first line of defense is honestly to go through your child's
backpack and see what's in there because there are a lot of items
unrelated to school," said Susan Truax, the mother of two middle
school students in El Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   Maureen DiMarco, senior vice president for textbook publisher
Houghton Mifflin, makes a similar argument.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea that regulating any one particular item in the backpack
will reduce what youngsters put in there is verging on silly," she
said. "Ask any parent of a teenager."</TE>
<TE>   "We are against curvature of the spine," she added. But publishers
say the concern should be the overall weight of backpacks, not
textbooks in particular.</TE>
<TE>   And reducing the textbooks' poundage would not be cheap, she said.
Large books might have to be broken into two or three smaller
volumes, which publishers estimate would add 25% to the cost.</TE>
<TE>   But backpack manufacturers and retailers say that textbook
publishers should bear some of the blame. Dale Jeffery, president of
the backpack maker SeeThru Backpacks Co. of Stafford, Texas, says
manufacturers have had to add special pads, straps and, in some
cases, air pockets to help students with their loads.</TE>
<TE>   Backpacks on rollers are wildly popular. Twenty percent of
SeeThru's sales are backpacks on rollers--up from 5% three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Textbook makers want to sell more textbooks, so they put more
pictures and stuff that may not add to the educational value but add
to the weight of the book," Jeffery said. "Lighter textbooks
certainly would make the situation better."</TE>
<TE>   Brett McFadden, legislative advocate for the Assn. of California
School Administrators, agreed that heavy backpacks are a "legitimate
public health, public policy issue" but cautioned that spending more
money on books may not be the best use of scarce money.</TE>
<TE>   "We think by placing the weight standard into legislation, you are
putting the cart before the horse," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly Martinez, parent of an eighth-grader at Carr Intermediate
School in Santa Ana, believes lighter texts are a good idea. "It's
crazy to be making them break their backs, carrying all that heavy
stuff back and forth," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Didier Catzin, a parent of a student at Robert E. Byrd Middle
School in Sun Valley, said his seventh-grade daughter Samantha's blue
Jansport backpack engulfs her tiny frame, and she has complained of
neck pain.</TE>
<TE>   "The real problem is they don't have lockers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of many such complaints, administrators at Byrd last year
purchased double sets of social studies and language arts books so
children would have fewer to lug around.</TE>
<TE>   But kids say they still tote a heavy load.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, it feels like carrying rocks," said seventh-grader
Robert Rader. He said he was not sure a smaller textbook "could carry
all the information it needs." But he added, "It will be better for
our backs."</TE>

<HD>Road Rubbish Causes Tie-Ups and Headaches</HD>
<DH>CHP warns that motorists who fail to secure oversized loads
can be cited, and also are liable for spills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ladders. Wood chippers. Trash cans. Tool boxes. Refrigerators. Chrome
tubes.</LD>
<LD>   Sounds like the inventory for Sanford and Son's salvage yard,
right?</LD>
<LD>   Actually, these are just a few examples of the kind of stuff that
is routinely if inadvertently dumped on California freeways, causing
traffic tie-ups and commuter headaches.</LD>
<TE>   On a recent Monday afternoon, the California Highway Patrol
reported the following traffic incidents: A roll of carpet and a
dolly were blocking traffic on the Santa Ana Freeway near Santa Ana;
a drive shaft was causing problems on the San Diego Freeway in San
Juan Capistrano; sheet metal was flying around the Ventura Freeway in
Ventura; and a tent was camped out in the slow lane of the Corona
Freeway in Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   Dee Dee Dollinger of Sepulveda wrote to Behind the Wheel to
complain that this kind of flotsam and jetsam on the freeways too
often contributes to roadway injuries and congestion. She blames such
problems on motorists who speed on the freeway with oversized loads
haphazardly strapped to the back of their vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Question: "Why isn't there a law that states limitations on length
of materials going beyond the back end of the tailgate or the walls
of the flatbed?"</TE>
<TE>   Answer: There is such a limit, but it varies with the size of the
vehicle. According to the California Vehicle Code, a load on any
vehicle cannot extend to the rear beyond the tailgate or "last point
of support" for a distance greater than two-thirds of the length of
the wheelbase of the vehicle. That means that one of those hulking
GMC Yukon SUVs can legally drive down the freeway with a tree trunk
the size of Shaquille O'Neal sticking out of the back. There is one
other requirement: Any load extending more than four feet must
display a red or orange flag or lights at night.</TE>
<TE>   CHP Officer Luis Mendoza concedes that the law allows motorists to
carry some pretty big loads, but he warns that drivers who fail to
secure the loads can be cited. And if that load gets away and brings
traffic to a bone-crunching halt, the motorist who failed to tie it
down can be liable for injuries and damage, he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duane Oden of Los Angeles can't stand it when slow-moving
motorists swing into the fast lane, only to bring his high-speed
drive to an agonizing crawl. He wrote to say that he suspects some of
these dawdling drivers purposely pull in front of faster traffic to
aggravate motorists like himself.</TE>
<TE>   Q: "Why don't CHP officers ever ticket these drivers?"</TE>
<TE>   A: This is a huge annoyance. The law is fairly clear on this
subject: Slower-moving traffic must move to the right.</TE>
<TE>   The reason for this law is twofold: The chances for accidents
increase when vehicles traveling at different speeds cut in and out
of each other's lanes. Also, transportation experts say that traffic
flow improves when vehicles on the same road travel at a uniform
speed. In other words, all that passing, braking and changing lanes
is dangerous and adds to freeway congestion. The solution: Pick a
lane that is moving at your pace and stick with it.</TE>
<TE>   As for Oden's question: Last year, the CHP issued 1,807 tickets to
motorists who were impeding traffic by driving too slow. But
speedsters are still the biggest freeway problem. Last year, the CHP
handed out more than 925,500 speeding tickets, which represents
nearly half of all CHP citations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Driving in carpool lanes can be confusing, and sometimes
well-meaning friends can only add to the confusion.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Ritz Hugus of Glendora wrote to say that she has recently
moved to Southern California from the Bay Area and is confused by the
rules regarding when she can enter and exit a carpool lane.</TE>
<TE>   Q: "My friend here says you can enter anytime but you must exit at
the white-line areas. Is she right?"</TE>
<TE>   A: Your friend is wrong and you can do us all a favor by hiding
her car keys. The law prohibits motorists from crossing the double
yellow line to enter the carpool lane. The only permissible place to
enter and exit the carpool lane is at those places where the double
yellow line is replaced by a broken white line. If you follow your
friend's advice, be ready to shell out $271 for a traffic citation.</TE>
<TE>   Another reader, Nan Sterman of San Diego County, also wonders
about the striping along the carpool lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Q: "What does it mean when there is a double line on the outside
of the lane (toward the fast lane) and a single white stripe inside
(toward the carpool lane)?"</TE>
<TE>   A: Under the California Vehicle Code, cars are prohibited from
driving left of a double-yellow line because, normally, that means
that you are driving into oncoming traffic. But on freeways, the
carpool lane is usually left of regular traffic lanes, separated by
the double yellow line. Thus carpoolers must drive left of a double
yellow line. When a single white line is added next to the double
yellow line, it signifies that it is OK to drive left of the
double-yellow line without fear of becoming a freeway tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In previous columns, readers have offered an array of ideas for
putting the brakes on police pursuits. The suggestions have ranged
from the sensible to the ludicrous.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement experts say the safest tactic is to pursue fleeing
suspects at a safe distance until they voluntarily stop or run out of
gas. Ramming or shooting a fleeing motorist is reserved for only the
most extreme circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   But some readers complain that this tactic allows the chases to
drag on too long. Here are a few ideas submitted by readers:</TE>
<TE>   Patt O'Neill of Palm Springs wrote to suggest that every car in
the state be fitted with a transponder that allows police to shut off
the engine of a fleeing suspect by remote control.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a lot of money, but I would be happy to pay it to
save lives of innocent bystanders in these grisly chases," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Kirwan of Venice wants to put an even quicker end to these
pursuits.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote: "To stop car chases, they should use military-type
helicopters to fire missiles at the car. If Israel can do it to
assassinate alleged terrorists, our pilots should be able to."</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Sommer of Rolling Hills suggests a less violent approach.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote: "My idea was to spray slime or mud on the windshield of
the car so the driver could not see where he is going and would have
to stop."</TE>
<TE>   Sommer may not have considered that fleeing bad guys could clear
away the slime or mud by simply switching on the windshield wipers.</TE>
<TE>   So far, no one has offered the tactic that has repeatedly proven
to stop traffic: Drop a ladder, a drive shaft or a tent in the path
of the fleeing car.</TE>

<HD>FBI to Search Tainted Building</HD>
<DH>Bioterrorism: Officials hope a sweep of the tabloid
publisher's abandoned Florida offices will aid in their stalled
anthrax probe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>FBI officials said Monday that they will go back into the
anthrax-contaminated American Media Inc. headquarters in Boca Raton,
Fla., this week to collect evidence they hope will aid in a stalled
criminal investigation into who sent the deadly bacteria.</LD>
<LD>   The latest search of the quarantined building comes nearly 11
months after 63-year-old Robert Stevens, a popular photo editor at
the tabloid publisher, was killed by an anthrax infection--the first
such death in the United States since 1976. Although top health
officials initially believed Stevens, an avid outdoorsmen, had
contracted the infection through natural sources, it soon became
clear that a bioterrorist attack had been launched.</LD>
<LD>   By late last year, four more people had been killed by anthrax and
at least 13 others had been sickened.</LD>
<TE>   At a news conference Monday in Florida, FBI officials said they
plan to reenter the three-story complex where Stevens worked as soon
as Wednesday to begin a "comprehensive search" that will take two
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope this investigation will bring to justice the person or
persons responsible for this horrific act," said FBI Special Agent
Hector Pesquera, head of the Miami field office.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier searches, FBI officials said, focused primarily on the
workspace of Stevens and the mailroom where two other employees
became ill. Both recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Using detection techniques that have been updated since the
attacks began, FBI officials said they hope to find a pattern in the
distribution of anthrax spores throughout the building that leads
them to an explanation for how the anthrax got there.</TE>
<TE>   A letter similar to those mailed to Sens. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and
Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and to media outlets in New York was not
found in previous searches of the building. Absent such evidence,
investigators have been unable to say for certain that anthrax
entered the American Media building through the mail as it did at
other locations where people were killed or sickened.</TE>
<TE>   Pesquera said Monday that he believed the new techniques would
allow scientists to track down the source for anthrax spores that
spread throughout the building.</TE>
<TE>   They also hope to discover a large enough quantity of spores to do
a comparison with bacteria recovered from the anthrax-laden letters,
something they have not yet been able to do.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials, however, declined to specify what techniques will
be used in the latest search.</TE>
<TE>   The 67,000 square feet of offices in Boca Raton have been frozen
in time since employees who put out the National Enquirer, Star,
Globe, Weekly World News, Sun and National Examiner dropped
everything to evacuate last fall once the extent of the danger became
clear.</TE>
<TE>   Since the attack was launched, criminal investigators have been
frustrated in the search for the anthrax killer. Few solid leads or
physical evidence have come to light since the first anthrax-tainted
envelopes addressed with block letters and postmarked Trenton, N.J.,
were uncovered.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, media attention has focused on former Army
researcher Steven J. Hatfill, 48, whom Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft has
characterized as a "person of interest" in the government
investigation. Although FBI sources have said they are looking at
about 20 people whose background and experience may have made it
possible for them to carry out the attacks, Hatfill's name so far is
the only one that has been widely reported.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill, who earlier in the investigation voluntarily submitted to
a polygraph test and searches of his residence, has responded by
twice defending himself publicly in the last month.</TE>
<TE>   Outside his lawyer's office in Alexandria, Va., on Sunday, the
expert on hemorrhagic blood diseases such as the Ebola virus said
emphatically: "I am not the anthrax killer." He also said he has
filed a series of complaints against the government alleging that
federal agents have violated his privacy, harassed him and are
"ruining" his life.</TE>
<TE>   Asked at the news conference about the timing and intent of this
week's search, Pesquera said the operation "has nothing to do" with
Hatfill.</TE>

<HD>City Seizes 237,000 Black-Market Cigarettes</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standing behind a chest-high pile of more than 237,000 cigarettes,
New York City officials said they had cracked down on stores selling
tobacco without a license.</LD>
<LD>   But smoker advocates say black-market sales will only grow in New
York, where a tax increase has pushed cigarettes to $7.50 a pack and
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is waging a policy war against smoking.</LD>
<LD>   The city seized 11,871 packs-- or 237,420 cigarettes--from 40
unlicensed sellers between February 2001 and February 2002, said
Pansy Mullings, enforcement chief of the Department of Consumer
Affairs.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities say they worry that unlicensed retailers are dodging
cigarette sales taxes and selling tobacco products to minors. To
obtain a license, sellers must agree to restrictions on signs and
pledge not to sell to minors.</TE>
<TE>   The city's Department of Finance will auction the seized
cigarettes to wholesalers.</TE>
<TE>   The cigarettes typically sell at auction for about $10 a carton,
and the pile seized in the crackdown will earn the city nearly
$14,000, said Martha Stark, the city finance commissioner.</TE>

<LD>A computer software consultant who responded to a jury summons by
demanding $100 an hour for his services showed up for duty, after a
judge's warning compelled him to lower his rate.</LD>
<LD>   David Williamson, like everyone else in the San Antonio jury pool,
will get $40 a day, plus mileage.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know if there was a misunderstanding about his
obligation, but he is doing his duty and complying," U.S. District
Judge Fred Biery said. Williamson, of San Antonio, was called in to
be part of the jury pool for a seven-week trial. He sent the court an
invoice for $16,800 for "court-ordered professional services for the
entire month of August 2002."</LD>
<TE>   He also warned officials that the bill would start accruing
interest if not paid by the end of August.</TE>
<TE>   And then came the topper: "If you would like to meet and discuss
this, please have his honor call and schedule an appointment."</TE>

<LD>Caffeine, the chemical stimulant in coffee and tea, has been found to
lower the risk of skin cancer in lab mice.</LD>
<LD>   A study suggests that a skin lotion spiked with caffeine or with
another compound found in green tea can reduce by more than half the
number of cancer tumors on the skin of hairless mice exposed to
brutal levels of ultraviolet radiation, said Dr. Allan Conney, a
professor of cancer and leukemia research at Rutgers University in
New Brunswick, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   "We had between 50% to 70% tumor formation inhibition in the mice
that were treated with caffeine or with EGCG," the other chemical
compound, said Conney, senior author of a study appearing this week
in the online site of the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences.</LD>
<TE>   Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the U.S. The American
Academy of Dermatology estimates about 1 million cases will be
diagnosed in the country this year. Among them will be more than
88,000 new cases of melanoma, the disease's deadliest form.</TE>
<TE>   To test effects of caffeine on skin cancer, Conney and his
colleagues exposed 90 mice to high levels of ultraviolet radiation
twice a day for 20 days. After the mice got their UVB doses, they
were divided into three groups. One group was slathered with a
solution of acetone and caffeine. Another group received acetone and
EGCG. The third group got skin applications of acetone only. Acetone
is an organic solution often used on skin.</TE>
<TE>   Conney said mice in all three groups developed malignant skin
tumors, called squamous cell carcinomas, but the number of tumors per
mouse was reduced by 72% in those treated with caffeine and by 66%
among those treated with EGCG, compared to the controls treated only
with acetone.</TE>

<HD>Leader of Ring to Smuggle Prized Caviar Pleads Guilty</HD>
<DH>Court: Russian merchant led group that illegally brought
protected roe from Poland to U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Gourmets beware: That exotic smoky gray delicacy that you recently
spread on a "blini" pancake--perhaps with a dab of sour cream--may
have been contraband.</LD>
<LD>   Viktor Tsimbal, a Russian who was the president and owner of the
Miami-based Beluga Caviar Inc., pleaded guilty Monday to
orchestrating a ring that smuggled large quantities of caviar--more
than Russia's entire annual worldwide export quota--to the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   Smugglers were paid $500 to carry luggage filled with 50 to 75
one-pound tins of black-market caviar from Poland to U.S. airports,
according to papers filed in U.S. District Court.</LD>
<TE>   Epicureans pay about $100 an ounce to nibble beluga roe--praised
for its sublimely smooth, buttery taste--from Caspian Sea sturgeon.
But the fish species is also paying a high price for those taste
treats, biologists say.</TE>
<TE>   Caspian sturgeon are protected under an international treaty that
strictly limits imports and exports of caviar. But beluga caviar from
Caspian Sea sturgeon is in such peril that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service has proposed adding it to the endangered species list. That
would cut off all imports.</TE>
<TE>   "Caspian Sea sturgeon may have been around since the age of
dinosaurs, but the appetite of smugglers for profit has the potential
to extinguish them from the earth," said Tom Sansonetti, assistant
attorney general of the Justice Department's environment and natural
resources division.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in late 1998, federal agents started catching couriers
with illegal shipments of un-refrigerated caviar in U.S. airports,
according to a Justice Department lawyer working on the case. The
smugglers had falsely labeled the tins of caviar as Atlantic
lumpfish, which is not a protected species, so couriers could declare
the fish eggs when coming through customs. Couriers were apprehended
in early 2000 in Miami International Airport carrying mislabeled
caviar.</TE>
<TE>   The couriers were arrested and put in jail, but they refused to
lead authorities to their contacts in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Agents became suspicious when far too much beluga caviar was being
sold in the United States, given shipping and customs documents,
according to the attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Using the code name Operation Southern Comfort, Fish and Wildlife
Service agents sent an undercover "source" to the Beluga Caviar
company in Miami in May 2000, where he was offered the caviar at less
than market price in tins labeled Atlantic lumpfish. DNA analysis
done by the Fish and Wildlife Service confirmed that the tins held
high-quality caviar.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, agents went to the company with a search warrant
and confiscated business records along with 895 tins of sturgeon
caviar worth about $550,000, according to the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   The haul represented only a small portion of Tsimbal's business,
according to court documents. In 1999 alone, Tsimbal imported about
22,700 pounds of caviar in shipments in which he misidentified the
roe as lumpfish or other fish eggs. Of this total, nearly six tons
was beluga caviar, most of it illegal and enough to surpass the
entire Russian export quota for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Justice Department believes Tsimbal--who ran a
parallel business that legally imported caviar--was one of the
biggest players in the caviar black market, he was not alone,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had Russian black caviar in those two years there's a
better than even chance you were purchasing and consuming smuggled
caviar," the Justice Department attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said the black market trade of Russian caviar
exploded after the fall of the Soviet Union, which was much better at
controlling poaching than its four former republics with Caspian Sea
coastlines.</TE>
<TE>   Sturgeon, which can live up to 100 years, are killed to extract
the roe, which is salted to make caviar. Female sturgeon often do not
reach egg-bearing age until they are 20 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Poaching of sturgeon for the caviar black market has put the fish
in peril, biologists say.</TE>
<TE>   "There is considerable evidence that there is very little native
spawning of the fish; that makes it very vulnerable," said Kenneth
Stansell, assistant director for international affairs of the Fish
and Wildlife Service.</TE>
<TE>   Although some sturgeon are reproducing in a Caspian region
hatchery, it is not enough to replenish wild stock.</TE>
<TE>   Tsimbal, 41, pleaded guilty to conspiracy, smuggling and money
laundering charges.</TE>
<TE>   The maximum term for each of the four counts of conspiracy and
smuggling is five years, while the maximum sentence for money
laundering is 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   He forfeited the $36,000 in his possession when he was arrested at
Miami International Airport and could face a fine of up to $1
million.</TE>

<HD>Secret U.S. Deportation Hearings Ruled Illegal</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: The broad closure of proceedings is
unconstitutional, federal appeals court says. It is the fourth
judicial challenge to Bush policy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The blanket closure of deportation hearings for individuals targeted
in the massive post-Sept. 11 terrorism investigation is
unconstitutional, a federal appeals court in Cincinnati ruled
unanimously Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling is the fourth this year and the first by a federal
appellate court striking down controversial government secrecy
policies enacted in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department has closed hundreds of immigration
hearings, even keeping the fact of the hearings secret, on the
grounds that permitting them to be held publicly could compromise the
nation's security.</LD>
<TE>   With hundreds of detainees already deported, the department said
earlier this summer that only 74 noncitizens held after Sept. 11
remained in custody.</TE>
<TE>   The 3-0 decision by the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a
ruling earlier this year by a federal trial judge in Detroit, who
said the Justice Department policy violated the 1st Amendment. In
addition, federal trial judges in Newark, N.J., and Washington, D.C.,
have ruled against the Justice Department in related cases where the
government was trying to keep secret information on arrests and
investigations related to the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In each instance, the judges handling the case acknowledged that
the government had legitimate concerns about terrorism but ruled that
it had failed to justify its arguments that secrecy was necessary.
All those rulings have been appealed.</TE>
<TE>   In Monday's decision, 6th Circuit Judge Damon J. Keith referred to
the Sept. 11 attacks as "egregious, deplorable and despicable," but
he said some of the arguments advanced by Justice Department
attorneys were "profoundly undemocratic."</TE>
<TE>   "The Executive Branch seeks to uproot people's lives outside the
public eye and behind a closed door," Keith wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Democracies die behind closed doors. The 1st Amendment, through a
free press, protects the people's right to know that their government
acts fairly, lawfully and accurately in deportation proceedings. When
the government begins closing doors, it selectively controls
information rightfully belonging to the people. Selective information
is misinformation," Keith said.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's decision means that any individual held for an
immigration-related problem in the 6th Circuit--which has
jurisdiction over cases from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and
Tennessee--is entitled to an open hearing unless an immigration judge
determines that publicly airing information in the case might raise
national security concerns, said Kary Moss, an American Civil
Liberties Union attorney in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling arose in the case of Rabih Haddad, a Lebanese native
who is a longtime resident of Ann Arbor, Mich., and the founder of
the Global Relief Foundation, an Islamic charity that the government
has been investigating since the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 14, the government took Haddad, 41, into custody, raided
the Brideview, Ill., headquarters of Global Relief and seized its
assets.</TE>
<TE>   After Haddad was detained, Elizabeth Hackett, an immigration judge
in Detroit, held three closed hearings in his case, citing a Sept. 21
directive by Michael Creppy, the chief U.S. immigration judge.</TE>
<TE>   The government asserts that Global Relief glorifies "martyrdom
through jihad," but the group denies that it has terrorist ties.
Ashraf Nubani, the organization's attorney, contends the group was
targeted because of help it provided to Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Global Relief sued to recover its assets, but the seizure
was upheld by a federal judge, who acknowledged that he based his
decision in part on secret evidence provided by the FBI. That ruling
is being appealed.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Haddad, several Michigan newspapers and Rep
John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) sued Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and other
government officials seeking a ruling that Haddad's deportation
hearings be open.</TE>
<TE>   The executive branch has virtually total power over immigration
matters, and in this case the Justice Department asserted that this
power should supersede any 1st Amendment right of access to
deportation proceedings. The 6th Circuit disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   In upholding U.S. District Judge Nancy G. Edmunds, the court ruled
that Haddad and the public had a right to be present at his
deportation hearings, unless the government made a strong showing
justifying the need for secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   In the case formally known as Detroit Free Press vs. Ashcroft, the
court said the government had made no such showing in this case and
offered "no persuasive argument as to why the government's concerns
cannot be addressed on a case-by-case basis."</TE>
<TE>   The 6th Circuit cited a long line of U.S. Supreme Court rulings
saying that the public and the press have a right to attend court
proceedings and that since "deportation proceedings bear a strong
resemblance to judicial trials," similar principles should apply. The
court also noted that deportation hearings historically have been
open.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Gelernt, senior staff counsel for the ACLU's immigrants rights
project, applauded the ruling: "The court's opinion makes clear that
blanket closure orders are unconstitutional and that the government
may not simply unilaterally declare that an entire category of cases
will be conducted behind closed doors without any public scrutiny."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Comstock, the Justice Department's public affairs
director, said the department was pleased that the court had
acknowledged that "the government has a compelling interest in
preventing terrorism and closing immigration proceedings that could
reveal information that allows 'terrorist organizations to alter
their pattern of activity to find the most effective means of evading
detection.' "</TE>
<TE>   But Comstock said the department "disagrees with the court's
conclusion that [the] department's guidelines for determining which
proceedings should be closed are too broad. The Justice Department
has an obligation to exercise all available options to disrupt and
prevent terrorism within the bounds of the Constitution, and will
review today's opinion in light of our duty to protect the American
people."</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department has the option of seeking review from a
larger panel of 6th Circuit judges or appealing directly to the
Supreme Court. All three judges who ruled against the government were
appointed by Democratic presidents, upholding Edmunds, who was tapped
for the bench by former President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The government is attempting to deport Haddad, as well as his wife
and three of their four children (the fourth is a U.S. citizen),
maintaining that they have overstayed their visas. Haddad is not
contesting that fact but has now applied for political asylum, saying
he might be persecuted if he was forced to return to Lebanon. Unlike
many of the post-Sept. 11 detainees, Haddad's identity and the date
of his arrest have been public for months and he has an active
support group, called the "Free Haddad Committee," working on his
behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department attorneys contend that if the deportation
hearings of "special interest detainees," such as Haddad, are open,
it "could lead to public identification of individuals associated
with them," as well as other investigative sources and potential
witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   The government also asserts that divulging the identity
of detainees could deter such individuals from cooperating and impair
the government's ability to infiltrate terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Justice Department maintained that closing the
hearings was justified to prevent the release of "bits and pieces of
information that may appear innocuous in isolation," but could be
used by terrorist groups to help form a "bigger picture ... a mosaic"
of the government's terrorism investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The 6th Circuit, while acknowledging that the government "has a
compelling interest in preventing terrorism," rejected these
arguments, saying, "While the risk of 'mosaic intelligence' may
exist, we do not believe speculation should form the basis for such a
drastic restriction of the public's 1st Amendment rights."</TE>
<TE>   Keith noted that in late April, after Edmunds ruled,
the government had "admitted that there was no information disclosed in
any of Haddad's first three hearings that threatened "national
security or the safety of the American people."</TE>
<TE>   Keith, a 1977 appointee of President Carter, expressed dismay that
"there seems to be no limit to the government's argument. The
government could use its 'mosaic intelligence' argument as a
justification to close any public hearing completely and
categorically, including criminal proceedings."</TE>
<TE>   "The government," Keith wrote, "could operate in virtual secrecy
in all matters dealing, even remotely, with 'national security,'
resulting in a wholesale suspension of 1st Amendment rights." His
opinion was joined by 6th Circuit Judge Martha C. Daughtrey and
federal trial Judge James G. Carr of Cleveland, sitting on special
assignment.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Eddie Joe Lloyd broke into tears as he talked about Michelle Jackson,
the Detroit teenager whose brutal rape and murder sent him to prison
for 17 years.</LD>
<LD>   A judge overturned Lloyd's conviction Monday after DNA tests
showed he couldn't have killed the 16-year-old girl.</LD>
<LD>   "If Michelle Jackson could have spoke from the grave, she would
have told everybody Eddie Lloyd didn't do it," Lloyd said after he
was freed.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the lack of physical evidence, Lloyd was convicted in 1985
based heavily on a taped confession he made to Detroit police while
he was in a mental hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd said the officer who interviewed him indicated that his
confession would help "flush out the real killer."</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea I would spend the next 17 years in prison," said
Lloyd, 54.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Lloyd hugged his sisters and talked about finally
meeting his grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to run the 50-or 100-yard dash with my grandbabies," Lloyd
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he wanted to repair his relationship with his family and
perhaps have a career working with children, "to be a productive
citizen so they can say, 'There's old man Lloyd. He's all right.' "</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd becomes the 110th convicted person in the United States and
the first in Michigan to be exonerated by DNA testing, according to
the Innocence Project.</TE>
<TE>   The genetic evidence in Jackson's slaying was gathered from a
bottle and a pair of long johns found at the crime scene, as well as
from evidence slides discovered three weeks ago, said Barry Scheck,
an attorney with the Innocence Project.</TE>
<TE>   The DNA doesn't match any samples in the FBI's database, meaning
Lloyd couldn't have committed the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was strangled with the long johns. Her body was discovered
in an abandoned building on Jan. 25, 1984, a day after she
disappeared while walking to school.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's family isn't taking the news well, Wayne County
Prosecutor Michael Duggan said. But he added, "I think they have come
to believe that Mr. Lloyd did not do it."</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd, who suffers from bipolar disorder, was in a mental hospital
and on medication when police say he confessed to Jackson's murder.
Police interviewed him after he wrote letters to a police sergeant
saying he had information regarding a number of cases, including
Jackson's.</TE>

<HD>Jeb Bush 'Still Very Strong' in His Quest for Reelection</HD>
<DH>Florida: Despite a tough year, governor leads in polls.
Democrats hope debate will attract voters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>It has not been an easy year for Jeb Bush. The child-welfare agency
he ultimately is responsible for has been rocked by repeated
scandals, and many voters disagree with his stance in favor of school
vouchers. A budget deficit has meant cutbacks in social services. On
a more personal note, his daughter was arrested on suspicion of
prescription drug fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Yet barring a political cataclysm, the president's younger brother
seems on course for reelection as Florida's governor, many analysts
say. "He is still very strong," said Susan MacManus, professor of
political science at the University of South Florida in Tampa. "His
poll numbers have not plummeted in spite of a lot of things that
might have brought down a weaker candidate."</LD>
<LD>   That's excellent news for Republicans, not just because it means
keeping a key statehouse in GOP hands, but also because the Sunshine
State is crucial to their presidential reelection strategy two years
from now.</LD>
<TE>   Tonight, Florida Democrats are hoping a televised debate in
suburban West Palm Beach among their party's candidates for governor
will help bring about a turnaround in voter sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   Former Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, Miami state Sen. Daryl Jones and
Bill McBride, a Tampa lawyer and Vietnam War veteran, are in a
three-way contest for their party's Sept. 10 primary. The well-known
Reno is the clear front-runner, although McBride has been making
gains. Jones, a former Air Force fighter pilot, is the first African
American ever to seek Florida's governorship.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a greater sense of vulnerability with Jeb in the last
three or four weeks than there has been in some time," said Bob Poe,
chairman of the Florida Democratic Party. "His negatives have gone
up. This situation is still very fluid. We have seen the Bush family
be very consistent in how they allow their leads to evaporate."</TE>
<TE>   There are other wild cards in Florida's political life, including
the notorious fickleness of this fast-growing state's electorate. In
the decade ending in 2000, voter rolls swelled by more than 2 1/2
million, with many newcomers feeling no particular allegiance to any
party. Also, Floridians traditionally don't pay much attention to
politics until after Labor Day, which may mean tonight's debate among
Democrats will generate scant interest among the general public.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Bush has well outpaced all three Democrats in
fund-raising, stockpiling $5.9 million. What's more, the 49-year-old
incumbent can count on millions of dollars in aid from the state GOP,
which will pay most of his campaign expenses. In comparison, McBride
so far has raised $1.9 million, and Reno $1.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   "All else being equal, I think simply having a great deal more
money can be important," said Joan Carver, professor emeritus of
political science at Jacksonville University. "Florida is such a big
state and it has so many media markets that to reach the votes you
need to advertise and be in various parts of the state, which costs a
lot of money."</TE>
<TE>   However, once the Democrats know who their standard-bearer will
be, millions of dollars in additional campaign funds are expected to
flood in from across the United States. Many Democrats have not
forgotten that it was Florida that cost them the 2000 presidential
election, and they blame the younger Bush for helping engineer his
brother's win.</TE>
<TE>   "The Democrats who are hesitant about Reno now, all that will
change when she wins the nomination," said MacManus, of the
University of South Florida. "Because the choice will be her vs.
Bush, and that's an easy choice for them."</TE>
<TE>   A statewide poll in June by Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Research showed
the governor with a wide lead in hypothetical head-to-head matchups
with Reno, McBride and Jones, defeating them by margins of 57% to
35%, 55% to 29% and 62% to 32%, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The survey also found that Bush had continuing, potent cross-party
appeal, and that the Republican, who is unopposed for his party's
nomination, would snatch 29% of Florida Democrats' votes from Reno in
a one-on-one competition.</TE>
<TE>   Even if many Floridians disagree with Bush's stance on a given
issue, numerous political science studies have shown that when making
their choice for governor, Americans are willing to ignore
differences on specifics and cast their ballots for the man or woman
they believe will make the strongest chief executive of their state.</TE>
<TE>   "People choose the whole persona," MacManus said. "Bush is sort of
known as a policy person and a bold man who is ready to tackle
issues, even if they are controversial. People know that under him,
Florida is just not sitting on the status quo."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, however, assert that Bush's image has been badly eroded
by months of news reports about errors and oversights in Florida's
Department of Children &amp; Families, which lost a 5-year-old Miami girl
in its charge. The agency's director resigned this month, but the man
Bush has nominated to take the job, Jerry Regier of Oklahoma,
immediately became embroiled in controversy himself because of his
ties to a Christian fundamentalist group, the Coalition on Revival.
Under Regier's name, the coalition printed an essay disapproving of
women who work and endorsing the spanking of children, even if it
causes bruises and welts.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there has been a real shift in the last few weeks in
terms of attitudes about this race," Poe said. As proof that the
Florida GOP is rattled, the Democratic Party official cited TV spots
that the Bush campaign has already started to air that accuse Reno
and McBride of dancing around the issues.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Harris, communication director of the Bush campaign, replied
that the Republicans were simply being prudent. "With Janet Reno,
it's tough to tell people something about her that they don't already
know," Harris said. If McBride were to defeat Reno in an upset, "we
don't want to be in the position where it is mid-September and we are
now running against someone who has just had two months of positive
TV behind him and people have already formed their first impression."</TE>
<TE>   McBride, who still trails far behind Reno in surveys of Democratic
voters, has won the endorsement of some labor unions and leading
legislators of his party, who believe he would have a better chance
of beating Bush in the Nov. 5 general election.</TE>
<TE>   Reno has much greater name recognition and grass-roots support,
but she also brings along a great deal of baggage from her service in
the Clinton Cabinet and her problems with Parkinson's disease. Reno's
decision as attorney general to send a young shipwreck survivor back
to Cuba has made her a loathed figure among Cuban Americans, a major
voting bloc in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Harris said he and Bush's running mate, Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan,
would be at tonight's Democratic debate to give the GOP point of view
to reporters and anyone else who wants to hear it. But he expected
the event to draw little interest among ordinary Floridians.</TE>
<TE>   "My guess is that it will probably be fairly boring," Harris said.
"You could play audio tapes of it to insomniacs who weren't
responding well to drugs, and put them to sleep."</TE>

<HD>Postal Service, FTC Move to Protect Elderly From Fraud</HD>
<DH>Crime: The agencies are launching awareness campaigns in an
effort to stem the increase in telemarketing and mail scams that
target seniors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT PATRICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When Susanne Conley-Higgins heard her mother say, "I'm going to win
the Canadian lottery," it was one of her first indications that the
86-year-old Maine woman was being scammed.</LD>
<LD>   Conley-Higgins, a postal clerk in Portland, Maine, soon found out
that her mother received as many as eight to 10 letters seeking money
each day and had accumulated $14,000 in credit card debt--due, in
part, to demands for as little as $11 at a time from fraudulent
sweepstakes appeals.</LD>
<LD>   Stacks of letters in her mother's house had return addresses of
Las Vegas, Kansas City, Mo., Australia and Canada.</LD>
<TE>   One rambling letter from a Swiss scammer asked for money and
included the ominous line: "I still carry my ... 9mm automatic--with
silencer of course."</TE>
<TE>   Conley-Higgins canceled her mother's credit card, and she now
keeps a much closer eye on her mother's mail.</TE>
<TE>   She is also using her experience to help other senior citizens,
attending a news conference held Monday by the Federal Trade
Commission, the U.S. Postal Service and the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police to highlight the dangers to senior citizens posed by
fraudulent or deceptive mailings and telephone calls.</TE>
<TE>   "Fraud complaints are on the rise, and more and more people age 60
and over are becoming victims," Chief Postal Inspector Lee Heath
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Postal Inspection Service responded to 66,000 mail fraud
complaints in 2001, he said, and is on track to respond to 83,000
this year--a projected increase of 26%.</TE>
<TE>   The National Consumers League says that Americans are bilked of
more than $40 billion annually by more than 14,000 illegal
telemarketing operations. The average victim lost $1,174 last year,
according to the Alliance Against Fraud in Telemarketing and
Electronic Commerce, a division of the Washington-based consumer
advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   Spike in Shutdowns</TE>
<TE>   The postal service shut down 40 illegal telemarketing operations
and 80 deceptive mailing operations from Oct. 1, 2000, to Sept. 30,
2001--about a 40% increase over the previous fiscal year. More than
$1.2 billion was returned to victims during the 2001 fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   "Fraud may be the only crime in which the intended victim has a
genuine opportunity to choose not to be a victim," Heath said.
"Awareness and education are keys to potential victims knowing how to
say 'no.' "</TE>
<TE>   Senior citizens face a dizzying array of potential phone and mail
scams. Mail designed to look as if it came from government agencies,
solicitations disguised as invoices, foreign lotteries, phony
inheritance schemes, home repair and improvement fraud and investment
fraud are only some of the scams the postal service has seen.</TE>
<TE>   Louis Johnson Jr. had his own story to tell. The 71-year-old Army
veteran has nine years on the Orange, N.J., police force and 13 years
as a welfare investigator on his resume, but he was taken just the
same.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said he debated whether to send $199 for a prize promised
in a 1995 phone call from Toronto: a motorboat, a car, $2,500 or a
trip for two to Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife said no, I said maybe," Johnson recalled. He decided to
send in the money but never received a prize, even after repeated
phone calls to the company.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can fall for a scam, anybody can fall for a scam," he said.</TE>
<TE>   RCMP Investigator Sylvain L'Heureux said that many scammers are
based in Canada and target U.S. residents, often in areas with high
populations of seniors. Phonebusters, a Canadian fraud complaint
line, receives the most complaints from California residents,
followed by residents of Texas and Pennsylvania, he said. European
residents are increasingly being targeted also.</TE>
<TE>   Alerting Public to Scams</TE>
<TE>   To raise awareness about the scammers, the postal service is
sending about 3 million postcards to areas with a high percentage of
older residents and placing more than 38,000 posters in post offices.</TE>
<TE>   About 300,000 "stamps by mail" orders, often used by senior
citizens, will include educational materials, and half-page ads will
be placed in newspapers across the country.</TE>
<TE>   The postal service and the FTC are also releasing public service
announcements featuring actress Betty White, as well as educational
videos. Settlements won against scammers are funding the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The FTC and the postal service caution consumers against giving
out bank account or credit card numbers over the phone. Heath said
consumers should never give in to pressure over the phone, get all
information in writing, check out the caller's record with the Better
Business Bureau and never send money in response to a foreign lottery
ad or solicitation. Participation in foreign lotteries is illegal in
the United States.</TE>

<HD>Public Health Officials Weigh Bioterror Risks</HD>
<DH>Safety: Advisory group confronts challenge of preparing the
U.S. for smallpox or other such attacks while addressing traditional
concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The latest in a series of events elevating the public health system
from the distant backwater of American medicine to a central role in
the nation's defense against terrorism is unfolding here this week in
a cavernous hotel ballroom.</LD>
<LD>   But none of the officials attending the first meeting of a new
advisory council on public health preparedness, which concludes
today, is gloating about the new respect--not to mention $3 billion
in federal funding--they've gained since last year's anthrax attacks.</LD>
<LD>   If anything, the potentially overwhelming challenge of helping to
prepare the nation for a smallpox, botulism, plague or other
bioterrorism attack energized the council's 21 members and a corps of
public health officials to use their new status and resources also to
address their more traditional concerns: controlling infectious
disease epidemics, immunizing children and, most recently, guiding
state and local responses to the West Nile virus.</LD>
<TE>   "Bioterrorism creates enormous challenges and risks to the
system," Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, director of the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said Monday. "If there is
a silver lining" from the anthrax attacks, "it is that we do have
renewed attention. But we have to make people realize that it's part
of providing care all the time."</TE>
<TE>   The formation of the committee--21 epidemiologists, health school
deans and other public health experts who report to Tommy G.
Thompson, secretary of Health and Human Services--is the Bush
administration's latest affirmation of the public health system's
role in bioterrorism preparedness.</TE>
<TE>   Jerome M. Hauer, director of the Office of Public Health
Preparedness, itself less than a year old, said he knew of "no other
time in federal government history when so much money has gone out so
quickly."</TE>
<TE>   It was in January that President Bush signed legislation passed by
Congress providing $3 billion for public health preparedness. By the
end of that month, $1.1 billion had been awarded to states and major
cities, and 20% of that was made available immediately. By early
June, after state plans for the money had been approved by federal
officials, virtually all the state and city funds had been
distributed.</TE>
<TE>   Explaining that federal officials had a "low threshold for
bureaucratic nonsense," Hauer said they "wanted to ensure the money
was used to build a system, not to buy toys."</TE>
<TE>   The funds are being used to renovate laboratories and increase
their capacity, to improve the detection of bioterrorism and other
infectious disease outbreaks, for health worker training,
bioterrorism response facilities and equipment and the development of
so-called surge capacity, making sure that at least 500 hospital beds
are available to handle a sudden influx of bioterrorism victims.</TE>
<TE>   While state and local health departments are just now beginning to
recover from years of under-investment, they must provide the first
and most critical response to both bioterrorism and more mundane
health matters, like who should get flu shots.</TE>
<TE>   Gerberding traveled recently to Louisiana, where she praised
laboratory workers for their "heroic" response to the outbreak of
West Nile virus, which is carried by infected mosquitoes and has
killed at least 16 people across the country in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   But the laboratory itself is "archaic," she said, adding that it
is "a classic example" of the many public health labs around the
country that need to be upgraded.</TE>
<TE>   "All terrorism is local," said Hauer, whose office is part of HHS.
But as the U.S. prepares for terrorism, he added, "we can rebuild
public health infrastructure to be prepared for other crises too."</TE>
<TE>   However, a critical part of that local response--the habits and
systems connecting private health-care providers to the local health
department--has often been weak or missing, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The most important element of infectious disease detection is the
"alert clinician who picks up the phone and tells the public health
department something strange is going on," said Dr. D.A. Henderson,
chairman of the committee whose status in the public health world is
almost legendary because of his role in eradicating smallpox.</TE>
<TE>   Several speakers noted that the first indication of a rare anthrax
case came in October when a physician called the Palm County, Fla.,
public health department. Anthrax spores sent through the mail
ultimately killed five people, sickened 17 and prompted more than
30,000 people to take preventive antibiotics.</TE>
<TE>   The routine reporting of strange symptoms, a surge in emergency
911 calls or an uptick in prescriptions for antibiotics cannot occur
if there aren't quick, easy and readily identifiable ways for doctors
and nurse practitioners to reach public health officials.</TE>
<TE>   Henderson and several committee members recounted instances in
which even they had been unable to find emergency telephone numbers
for the CDC or local health agencies. Some of the bio-terrorism funds
are being used to develop better, more coordinated public health
communication systems.</TE>
<TE>   The public health system has another need, however, that money
alone cannot fill. Several committee members and public officials
bemoaned the severe shortage of epidemiologists, microbiologists and
public health nurses.</TE>
<TE>   Although $20 million has been funneled to training programs in
public health schools, "we're going to be short of staff for some
time," Henderson said.</TE>

<HD>Midwest May Be Key to GOP Senate Hopes</HD>
<DH>Politics: Races with four Democratic incumbents could
decide which party controls the chamber.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Striding through the crowded midways of the Minnesota State Fair,
Republican Senate candidate Norm Coleman sets a pace so brisk an
accompanying camera crew can barely keep up.</LD>
<LD>   And when he encounters voters, Coleman, a former mayor of St.
Paul, doesn't hesitate in trying to close the sale. "I need your
vote," he says amiably but insistently to one man unready to commit.
"Take a yard sign," he says firmly to another who promises his
support. "Talk to your friends."</LD>
<LD>   Coleman's urgency reflects the stakes in his spirited and bruising
race against Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone. In Senate contests this
year, the Midwest has emerged as the largest cluster of GOP
opportunity. Republicans are mounting serious challenges to
Democratic incumbents in four states that tilted sharply toward the
GOP in the 2000 presidential race, especially in rural areas.</LD>
<TE>   To recapture the Senate, Republicans will almost certainly have to
defeat at least one, and probably more, of those four incumbents:
Wellstone, Tim Johnson in South Dakota, Jean Carnahan in Missouri and
Tom Harkin in Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Amid public concerns about the economy and corporate corruption,
all four Democrats look somewhat stronger today than they did earlier
in the year. In the latest polling, Wellstone has opened a small lead
over Coleman, while Johnson is locked in a virtual dead heat with
Republican Rep. John R. Thune. The latest surveys show Carnahan with
a double-digit lead over former GOP Rep. Jim Talent, and Harkin
leading Republican Rep. Greg Ganske by nearly that much.</TE>
<TE>   But none of these Democrats can breathe easy. That's partly
because none won more than 52% of the vote in his or her last
election. Even more important, all are swimming against a current
that has carried the GOP to big gains in rural and small-town America
since the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Though the trend hasn't attracted nearly as much attention as the
Democratic advance in suburban communities around the country,
Republicans have established enormous advantages in the parts of
America where John Deere dealers outnumber Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as 1996, rural voters preferred the GOP by just 4
percentage points in congressional elections and gave Bob Dole only a
2-point advantage over Bill Clinton, according to the Voter News
Service exit poll.</TE>
<TE>   But in 2000, rural voters gave George W. Bush a 22-point margin
over Al Gore in the presidential race and provided Republicans an
equal spread in the congressional races, the exit polls found.</TE>
<TE>   In that race, the bottom fell out for Democrats in wide swaths of
Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri and South Dakota. In each state, Bush won
back large numbers of counties that had backed Clinton in
1996--almost all of them rural communities or "exurban" counties on
the crabgrass frontier, where the most distant suburbs blend into the
countryside.</TE>
<TE>   In this fall's Senate elections, the critical question may be
whether that massive shift represented a high point for the GOP in
the countryside--or a new water level that will buoy Republicans for
years.</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining Bush's breakthrough in rural and exurban communities
is vital for the GOP because the evidence suggests the party hasn't
made nearly as much progress among voters living in the traditional
suburbs close to major cities such as Minneapolis, St. Louis and Des
Moines.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to continue to run strongly in rural areas to be able to
win these states," says GOP pollster Linda DiVall. "The suburbs are
changing."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides agree that a backlash against the Clinton scandal, and
personal doubts about Gore, explains part of the GOP surge in the
countryside in 1998 and 2000. But Matthew Dowd, the polling director
at the Republican National Committee, says personalizing the problem
to Gore and Clinton may be wishful thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Dowd, who also directed polling for the Bush 2000 campaign, says
the key to Republican Midwestern gains is that younger rural and
small-town men across the region are migrating toward the GOP--mostly
around taxes, national security and cultural issues such as gun
control--the way their counterparts did years before in the South.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the younger males more and more voting with the Republicans
that is causing these states like Minnesota to become much more of a
swing state," Dowd says.</TE>
<TE>   Dowd has in mind voters such as Mike Fournier, a hulking school
bus driver who voted for Wellstone in 1990 and Bill Clinton in 1992
but has moved toward the GOP while leaving Minneapolis for the
distant northern suburb of Spring Lake Park. "More and more I'm
starting to lean toward the Republican Party because the things the
Democrats are behind I can't support anymore," he says moments after
promising Coleman his vote at the fair.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Dowd acknowledges that this movement among small-town men
isn't enough to win these states for the GOP Senate hopefuls this
year. "It is putting them in the game more than before," he says,
"but you are going to have to win more suburban women also to win."</TE>
<TE>   And that creates an inherent tension for Republicans because the
culturally conservative, anti-tax, small government messages that
sell extremely well with rural men can still drive away more moderate
suburbanites, especially women.</TE>
<TE>   In Minnesota, for instance, Coleman--a former Democrat who only
switched parties in 1996 and still presents himself as a
moderate--has tried to buff his environmental credentials by opposing
Bush's proposal to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil
exploration. But in a debate this month, Coleman wooed farm votes by
accusing Wellstone of an "absolutist approach" on environmental
issues that he said was driving small farmers out of business.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone predicts that attack will hurt Coleman more in the
suburbs than it helps him in rural Minnesota. "This state loves its
rivers, lakes and streams," he says, "and to be a strong
environmentalist is a plus."</TE>
<TE>   Some recent trends may be bolstering these endangered Democrats.
All may gain from helping to deliver the expensive farm bill that
Bush recently signed into law. Apart from Ganske, who voted against
the bill in the House, none of the challengers is criticizing the
bill.</TE>
<TE>   Nor are most of the Republican challengers as easy a cultural fit
in rural communities as Bush. Thune seems at home in cowboy boots.
But Ganske was a plastic surgeon from Des Moines, and Talent, a
brainy lawyer, looks like he lives in the affluent suburbs he once
represented. Coleman was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., and served as a
big-city mayor here. Wellstone, as an organizer for liberal rural
causes before his Senate election in 1990, probably has deeper
personal ties in rural Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   More broadly, the Democrats may also be benefiting from the rising
concern over economic security, which could eclipse the cultural
issues that have keyed the Republican gains in the countryside. The
sliding stock market has provided Democrats with a new argument
against Republican proposals to partially privatize Social
Security--an issue Johnson and Wellstone are stressing. And the
concerns about corporate corruption have played to the strengths of
Harkin and Wellstone, who defined themselves as populists long before
Enron and WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   But the unsettled climate of 2002 is also highlighting traditional
Republican strengths. Against the backdrop of the war against
terrorism, Republicans in the four races are trying to paint the
Democrats as weak on national security.</TE>
<TE>   In Minnesota, Coleman has relentlessly portrayed Wellstone as "out
of the mainstream" on defense. "The path he advocated would have
severely undermined our ability to vanquish our determined enemies,"
Coleman charges. In Coleman's quick conversations with men who stop
to support him at the fair, it's clear that argument has an audience.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans in these races are also betting heavily on
taxes--especially the piece of Bush's agenda of most direct interest
to farmers. In June, all four Democratic incumbents voted against a
Republican plan that would make permanent the repeal of the estate
tax approved last year; currently, the tax is scheduled to be
reinstated after 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Americans for Job Security, a conservative group, has been
pounding the four Democrats with radio ads on rural stations in which
a fictional farm couple laments that the estate tax could force them
to sell their family farm. The Republican challengers, especially
Thune and Coleman, are banging that gong too.</TE>
<TE>   But the Democrats--who all voted for a party alternative that
would have permanently exempted the first $3.5 million in estates
from taxation--aren't shying away from the argument.</TE>
<TE>   With their history of economic populism and cultural conservatism,
these farm states lie across the fault line between the red
(Republican) and blue (Democratic) America that emerged so starkly in
the 2000 election. As the two parties claw for control of the Senate,
even small tremors here may send large shock waves around the
country.</TE>

<HD>Charges Sought in Oregon Killings</HD>
<DH>Crime: Prosecutors say they plan to indict ex-convict Ward
Weaver in slayings of two girls whose remains were found at his home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OREGON CITY, Ore.</DL>
<LD>The former convict who publicly had proclaimed himself a suspect in
the disappearance last winter of two young girls finally was named
Monday as the target of a grand jury murder investigation.</LD>
<LD>   "We will seek an indictment against Ward Weaver," Greg Horner,
chief deputy district attorney for Clackamas County, said from the
steps of the courthouse here--just a few miles from where authorities
discovered two sets of human remains at Weaver's home over the
weekend.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, dental records confirmed that the remains found
underneath a shed were those of Miranda Gaddis, 13, an eighth-grader
who vanished in early March. And late Monday, the medical examiner
said dental records for the second set of remains, which was found
sealed in a metal drum buried under a concrete slab, belonged to
Ashley Pond, Miranda's best friend, who disappeared in early January.
Weaver, 39, installed the slab in his backyard in March, saying it
was a pad for a future hot tub.</LD>
<TE>   The girls' disappearances rocked this working-class town, a suburb
20 miles south of Portland with tall pines, unmarked gravel driveways
and strip malls.</TE>
<TE>   Many parents feared a serial kidnapper was on the loose, and the
management at Newell Creek Village Apartments, where both girls had
lived, watched as residents packed up and left out of fear.</TE>
<TE>   Even as word began to leak out this summer about Weaver's criminal
history--including a conviction for beating a baby-sitter with a
12-pound chunk of concrete--the investigation maintained an even
pace; many residents thought it plodding, but authorities said they
did not want to make any wrong moves.</TE>
<TE>   The girls' families defended authorities Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "They did what they had to do to keep it legal," said Miranda's
great-aunt, Donna Doty, who stood outside Weaver's home Monday. "The
FBI and police department were wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has insisted that it needed enough evidence to prove
probable cause to scour Weaver's yard beyond the initial search he
allowed them to do in January.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Neiman, who performed that 45-minute search with a
cadaver-sniffing dog, said he thinks Weaver may have kept the girls
alive for a few weeks, until after the first search.</TE>
<TE>   "There were no fresh dig marks," Neiman said. "The cement slab
wasn't put in until three days after Miranda disappeared" in March.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver gave the agents free rein of his unkempt yard, but he
refused to let them in the house.</TE>
<TE>   "He was really adamant," said Neiman, the founder of Search ONE
K-9 Detection, who works only with law enforcement and oversees
certification for search dogs in Oregon. "We had the dog sniff the
vents and crawl space [accessible from outside the house], in case he
had stuffed her there."</TE>
<TE>   Mourners who came to read some of the messages hanging from a
chain-link security fence around Weaver's yard Monday said they were
chilled by the sight of his house right at the mouth of the road to
Newell Creek Village. A sign read: "It breaks my heart that all they
had to do was look. I hope you find peace now."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last few months, authorities examined the computers used
by both girls for possible clues; search dogs were dispatched several
times to different sites with hopes they would pick up a scent,
including the woods behind the apartment complex.</TE>
<TE>   There was a $60,000 reward for information, and the girls' cases
appeared multiple times on Fox's "America's Most Wanted" and the
national morning television news shows. Authorities also interviewed
nearly every sex offender in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "We got onto this property just as soon as we legally could,"
Oregon City Police Chief Gordon Huiras said.</TE>
<TE>   But some relatives and friends of the girls' families complained
to local newspapers that the simplest things were overlooked. They
said the FBI never contacted them. Others said their reporting of
tips or other information about Weaver was ignored.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview this summer with the Oregonian newspaper in
Portland, Weaver bragged about his abysmal performance on an
eight-question polygraph test and acknowledged that 12-year-old
Ashley once had accused him of molesting her.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, Ashley's problem was she just wanted someone to care
about her," he told the paper.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Lake, a 43-year-old father of two teenage boys, came out
Monday to read some of the notes that cover the fence, along with
teddy bears, flowers and photographs of the girls.</TE>
<TE>   He said he'd heard the criticism of authorities but was
unconvinced. "I think they wanted to make sure he couldn't get off on
a technicality. They did the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   But Oscar James, a 26-year-old landscaper, disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand there are laws and everything, but I do honestly
believe that had their parents been in a higher tax bracket, this
would have been taken care of a lot sooner," James said.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, he stood outside Weaver's home holding a small sign
toward a line of slow-moving cars that said "Lights On."</TE>
<TE>   "When you're going to a funeral, you keep your lights on--a little
light to help people through the darkness," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For the time being, authorities do not have to rush their
investigation. At a court hearing Monday evening, Weaver was evicted
from the house, because he is unable to pay the rent. He is in jail
with bail set at $1 million on a charge that he raped the 19-year-old
mother of his infant grandson. She told authorities that she was
driving Weaver to traffic court Aug. 13 when he asked her to swing by
his house for a few things.</TE>
<TE>   He convinced her to come into the bedroom of his 13-year-old
daughter, who used to play with Ashley and Miranda. It was there that
he allegedly raped and tried to smother the woman. Weaver pleaded not
guilty to the rape charge.</TE>
<TE>   When Weaver's son called 911 to report the alleged attack, he told
authorities that Weaver had admitted to killing and burying the girls
in his backyard.</TE>
<TE>   From his jail cell on Friday night, Weaver gave authorities
written consent to search his home and yard in an effort, his
attorney said, to give the girls' families "closure."</TE>

<HD>Pentagon Rises From the Ashes of Sept. 11</HD>
<DH>Aftermath: The complex was refurbished to make it appear as
it did before attack. Withstanding a terrorist assault was also part
of the renovations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The offices behind the nearly white limestone of the Pentagon's newly
renovated southwestern facade look, eerily, as they did in the early
morning hours of Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   But eight inches of standing water from the sprinkler system, plus
the resulting mold, and the stench of the exploding diesel from full
jet fuel tanks left construction crews with little choice but to
replace nearly every visible inch of the scarred slice of the
building--from the cement and marble of the poured terrazzo floor to
the blast-proof windows and freshly painted drywall on the ceiling.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly everything has been re-crafted with a future attack in
mind--and a desire to make it look as if the clock has been set back.</LD>
<TE>   This Sept. 11, as planners are still considering a sweeping
transformation of New York's crumbled World Trade Center, 3,000 of
the 4,600 employees who worked on the damaged side of the Pentagon
before the terrorist attack will have returned to a military
headquarters deliberately remade to erase the devastation wrought by
a hijacked airliner that killed 125 workers inside and 64 aboard
American Airlines Flight 77. The focus on restoring the Pentagon's
glory is revealed in the name of the reconstruction effort: "The
Phoenix Project," after the mythical bird that was burned and then
rose from its own ashes.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. Henry Huntley was one of 130 workers moving into their
newly renovated first-floor offices this week. Inside, the Army's
public affairs office remains an unadorned hollow of clean desks and
stacked boxes.</TE>
<TE>   "We know what happened here on Sept. 11, and it's something that
we'll never forget," Huntley said. "But we haven't let that stop us.
We're moving forward.... The Pentagon has life."</TE>
<TE>   Behind the refurbished stone, the same type of fluorescent lights
rest in the same-style acoustical ceiling tiles in the coveted outer
offices of the Pentagon's E Ring, illuminating the same plush red
carpet and dark-stained desks as those in the Joint Staff offices
across the building. The replacement limestone was hauled from the
same vein in Indiana as the original stone, lighter than the original
rock but destined to darken with time and soot from Route 27 nearby.
But there are some differences. The exit signs, for instance, are no
longer at eye level. With a glow-in-the-dark life of four hours, they
now sit only six inches off the ground, where hundreds of workers
dropped to avoid the lung-searing black smoke from the diesel fuel of
the jetliner that crashed into the first floor, sending a fireball
through the cubicle farms above. Survivors who found the higher exit
signs virtually useless suggested the change.</TE>
<TE>   "The jet fuel left a black smoke that was coming down as you moved
forward," said Lt. Col. Franklin Childress, a public affairs officer
who interviewed many survivors. "People were yelling, 'Get down! Get
down!' "</TE>
<TE>   Childress lost 24 of his colleagues in the Army's second-floor
personnel office. He attributes his survival to "divine
intervention": He had been on the job just one week and was at his
home a mile away to meet the moving van, a day late for its scheduled
Sept. 10 delivery.</TE>
<TE>   To accompany the new exit signs, there are additional exits. Each
piece of limestone on the building's facade has been replaced or
cleaned--except one, with "September 11, 2001" etched into the
charred stone. Perhaps the most noticeable change for the occupants
is a starker blast of air-conditioning, kept cooler inside
better-insulated walls.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the attack, renovations to the 400,000-square-foot
section were being completed. Project managers essentially tore
everything down and rebuilt.</TE>
<TE>   This time, building to withstand a terrorist assault was "standard
operating procedure," said Jean Barnak, the Pentagon's deputy project
manager for the renovation. Many of the subtle innovations in the
refurbished area, such as the lowered exit signs, will likely be
included as other parts of the building are renovated, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the memorials. In the second floor of the outer
ring, workers are moving stained glass from the third floor to a new
chaplain's office, already adorned by a stained-glass eagle
superimposed over the five-sided building with the script, "United in
Memory, Sept. 11, 2001." In the next room, the wall reads "America's
Heroes," above a space reserved for the victims' names.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, John Deere tractors and concrete rollers rush to smooth
the ground where a memorial ceremony will be held on the anniversary
of the attack. Nearby, workers clear the site for a permanent
memorial.</TE>
<TE>   The project is not due to be finished until spring, but the
construction has marked a refreshing change for anyone who has waited
for contractors to complete a job. With some workers voluntarily
spending Thanksgiving, Christmas and other holidays on the site, some
portions of the renovation have been as much as a month ahead of
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "There was such a common cause here. Everyone did what they were
supposed to do when they were supposed to do it--or even earlier,"
Barnak said as a worker rolled paint on the window sill behind her.
"I would have workers come over and say how proud they were to have
worked on the project. They'd come over and thank you for being
allowed to work on it."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Two Washington priests accused of sexual abuse have been dismissed
from the ministry under a nationwide policy adopted this summer by
Roman Catholic bishops.</LD>
<LD>   Father Paul E. Lavin and Msgr. Russell L. Dillard were dismissed
by Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick, a spokeswoman for the Washington
Archdiocese said.</LD>
<LD>   Lavin, the pastor of a Capitol Hill parish, and Dillard, pastor of
St. Augustine Roman Catholic Church, were suspended after allegations
were made against them this year.</LD>
<TE>   Catholic bishops approved a zero-tolerance policy for sexual abuse
of minors after scandals involving priests drew national attention.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Gibbs, spokeswoman for the archdiocese, said a review board
found allegations against both men credible and that McCarrick's
decision was an interim step under the new policy. She told
Associated Press the priests can appeal their dismissals to the
Congregation for the Clergy at the Vatican, which will have the final
say.</TE>

<LD>We could go days, weeks or even a year (if the hard-line owners are
to be believed) without baseball.</LD>
<LD>   It wouldn't be as painful as the 12 minutes the game stopped
Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly this wasn't about greedy players or untrustworthy owners
or angry fans or all of the acrimony building toward Friday's looming
strike date. This was about a person's health, and the realization
that for all the riches these players make to play a sport, theirs is
an inherently dangerous profession.</LD>
<TE>   You can scoff at any implications of unfairness the well-paid
players feel, but then you see grass and dirt treated with more
respect than a human's condition.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger shortstop Alex Cora, who has been as good a guy as any this
year with his unselfish commitment to team's best interests, tried to
steal second base in the bottom of the ninth inning of a tied game
with the Arizona Diamondbacks. The throw was high and Arizona's Tony
Womack leaped to grab it as Cora made a headfirst dive toward the
base. Womack's right knee caught Cora in the head. Cora landed with a
thud, grabbed his head and then lost consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   While Womack clutched his knee in agony, Cora was motionless, face
down on the infield.</TE>
<TE>   When an ambulance entered through the center-field gates, instead
of heading straight toward second base it drove around the rubber
warning track that encircles the field, coming to a stop near the
photographers' well next to the Dodger Stadium dugout. Workers
started to bring a stretcher out to Cora.</TE>
<TE>   I don't have extensive medical knowledge, but I know that when
head, neck or spine injuries are feared the objective is as little
movement for the victim as possible. How would transporting him by
stretcher across the infield fit that objective?</TE>
<TE>   Finally, some wiser heads prevailed and the ambulance was given
the go-ahead to drive across the infield to Cora's position. Cora,
who had regained consciousness, was strapped to a backboard and
loaded into the ambulance, which took the direct route out to the
centerfield exit.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Nildamarie, had come onto the field and was trying to
reach Alex, but Manager Jim Tracy and relief pitcher Giovanni Carrara
restrained her until the ambulance left.</TE>
<TE>   You say you won't miss baseball with the arrival of football
season?</TE>
<TE>   Well, this scene was all too reminiscent of a football game. The
worst part of football. The fear of paralysis part of football.</TE>
<TE>   Every time I'm on the sideline of a pro or major college football
game I'm amazed that there aren't more devastating injuries with all
of the high-speed, high-impact collisions.</TE>
<TE>   The same goes for baseball, with its 95-mph pitches and broken and
lost bats flying around.</TE>
<TE>   The worst football fears came to fruition on a baseball field. The
game stopped. So did all of the acrimony, or any thoughts of a
pennant race or competition.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodger Stadium fans cheered Womack as he got up and walked
around. There were only muted cheers and boos the rest of the night</TE>
<TE>   In a move that was better handled than the ambulance situation,
the Diamondvision screen carried an update on Cora's condition in the
middle of the 10th inning. He had a concussion, but full feeling in
his hands and feet. The fans cheered.</TE>
<TE>   Cheering at a baseball stadium. It sounded good. And this might be
simple, but it's a worthy goal to keep in mind when the labor
negotiations resume.</TE>

<HD>Streaky Lidle, A's Win</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cory Lidle managed to regroup in time after his scoreless inning
streak was ended after 32 innings because of an unearned run.</LD>
<LD>   David Justice's error helped end Lidle's streak, but the Oakland
Athletics still managed to win their 13th game in a row, defeating
the Kansas City Royals, 6-3, Monday night at Kansas City, Mo.</LD>
<LD>   "I lost my composure a little bit and I started overthrowing,"
Lidle said. "I didn't handle it very well."</LD>
<TE>   Ramon Hernandez had three hits and drove in three runs as the A's
extended the longest streak in the majors this season. The winning
streak is their longest since they set an Oakland record with a
14-game streak in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez had a two-run single in Oakland's four-run sixth.
Jermaine Dye, who played with the Royals from 1997-2001 before being
dealt to Oakland last July, and Ray Durham each had RBI singles. Dye,
who had three hits, doubled home Miguel Tejada in the ninth for the
last run.</TE>
<TE>   The second-inning unearned run off Lidle (8-9) was the first he
had given up since the sixth inning on July 31 at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Lidle limited the Royals to three singles over seven innings. He
did not give up a hit after Raul Ibanez's one-out single in the
third. Lidle is 5-0 in August and has not given up an earned run in
38 innings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York 10, Texas 3--Alex Rodriguez hit his major league-leading
46th home run on an eephus pitch from Orlando Hernandez (7-3), but
everything else went the Yankees' way at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso Soriano hit his 31st homer, setting a team record for
second basemen, and drove in three runs. Jason Giambi reached 100
runs batted in, Derek Jeter made a headfirst slide home to score his
100th run, and Bernie Williams and three more singles, extending his
hitting streak to 17 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 8, Detroit 2--Rookie Ricardo Rodriguez got his first
career victory and ejection as the Indians handed the visiting Tigers
their sixth consecutive loss. Rodriguez (1-1), making only his second
career start, was two outs away from a shutout when Randall Simon
homered for the Tigers. Rodriguez's next pitch hit Robert Fick on the
right elbow, and he was thrown out by plate umpire John Hirschbeck.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 8, Chicago 4--Blue Jay relievers pitched six hitless
innings and Dewayne Wise hit a three-run double in the victory at
Chicago. Corey Thurman (2-2) earned the victory with three innings of
relief. Mark Hendrickson worked the seventh, Cliff Politte pitched a
perfect eighth and Kelvim Escobar finished.</TE>

<HD>A Bad Getaway Day for Angels</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Four-run lead disappears in ninth and Damon's
homer seals crushing 10-9 loss in 10th.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>This isn't Dave Henderson, but it's close.</LD>
<LD>   Henderson ranks as perhaps the most infamous villain in Angel
history, with his one-strike-away home run that prevented the Angels
from beating the Boston Red Sox in the 1986 playoffs and advancing to
the World Series. The Angels have yet to return to the playoffs, and
another Boston outfielder struck a dagger into the hearts of
long-suffering Angel fans Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Johnny Damon is his name, a name no doubt cursed in Orange County
from the moment he thrust his fist into the air in celebration. After
the Angels' dreadful ninth inning, in which closer Troy Percival blew
a four-run lead and blew the save as well, Damon led off the 10th
with a home run off rookie Scot Shields, good for a stunning 10-9
Boston victory.</LD>
<TE>   There wasn't much good for the Angels to think about on the long
flight home. They left home leading the American League West, but
they lost four of seven games in New York and Boston and return in
third place in the division and in second place in the wild-card
standings.</TE>
<TE>   For only the second time this season--and the first time since
April--Percival failed to protect a ninth-inning lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, a resilient bunch all season and a team that has
resolutely refused to say any one game is bigger than another,
insisted the loss would not devastate a team one-half game out of a
playoff spot with 32 games left--or three, if players strike Friday
and do not return this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless I wake up and we have two losses from tonight's game,"
Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said, "this loss has no more meaning."</TE>
<TE>   Just another game? Not to the Red Sox, who were one strike away
from falling 4 1/2 games back in the wild-card race. As the home run
cleared the wall--and not by much, even at an only-in-Fenway distance
of 315 feet--Damon circled first base and pumped his fist high into
the air. As he crossed the plate, his teammates jumped up and down
around him, and onto him.</TE>
<TE>   Damon called it the biggest hit of his career. Grady Little,
Boston's rookie manager, called it the biggest victory of his career.</TE>
<TE>   And the Angels?</TE>
<TE>   "That's going to happen every once in a while," first baseman
Scott Spiezio said. "I'm not worried about this team at all."</TE>
<TE>   That the Angels even needed to use Percival was embarrassing
enough, on a night the Red Sox made four errors. The Angels had 17
hits and stranded 13 runners.</TE>
<TE>   Al Levine had gotten the final two outs in the eighth inning. With
a 9-5 lead, Scioscia asked him to pitch the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Manny Ramirez singled, his fifth hit of the game, and so did Cliff
Floyd. With Percival now eligible for the save, Scioscia removed
Levine.</TE>
<TE>   Percival threw nothing but fastballs, 31 in all, each pitch
clocked at 97 or 98 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Shea Hillenbrand smacked a two-strike single up the middle,
loading the bases. Percival got two strikes on Brian Daubach, then
walked him, forcing home a run. Jason Varitek struck out, the first
out.</TE>
<TE>   Trot Nixon hit a sacrifice fly, scoring Floyd and shrinking the
Angel lead to 9-7. On the sacrifice fly, Hillenbrand advanced from
second to third. That left pinch-runner Rickey Henderson on first
with an open base ahead of him and Percival, with a high leg kick
even from a stretch, on the mound.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, Henderson stole second. Then Rey Sanchez worked the
count full, fouled off two more pitches, then drilled a line drive
into left-center field.</TE>
<TE>   Hillenbrand scored from third and Henderson from second, tying the
score, 9-9.</TE>
<TE>   While the Red Sox trail the Angels and Seattle Mariners in the
wild-card race, the September schedule offers Boston a generous
chance to catch up. While the Angels, Mariners and Oakland A's beat
up on each other in the AL West, the Red Sox are scheduled to
conclude their season series with the Yankees next week and play
their final 25 games against teams with losing records.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Pesky Has High Praise for Eckstein</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>He is a living history of one of the most fabled franchises in the
major leagues, as much a part of the Boston Red Sox as Fenway Park
itself. Johnny Pesky, 82, a former All-Star shortstop, manager,
coach, executive and broadcaster for the Boston Red Sox, reports to
the creaky old ballpark every day, hitting fungoes and dispensing wit
and wisdom.</LD>
<LD>   In 1997, while coaching the young Red Sox infielders, he took a
particular liking to a second baseman named David Eckstein. The two
men, the sage and the disciple 55 years his junior, greeted each
other warmly Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "My sweetheart," Pesky said. "I love that little guy. I'm sorry we
ever let him go. That was one of the things I just couldn't
understand."</LD>
<TE>   When the Red Sox tried to sneak Eckstein through waivers two years
ago, the Angels claimed him. Now he is the Angels' starting
shortstop, at 5 feet 7, compared by Pesky to two of his Hall of Fame
contemporaries.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a throwback to the old days," Pesky said. "[Phil] Rizzuto
was small. [Pee Wee] Reese was small.... It just goes to show you
don't have to be 6-4 to be a great player in this game. He works
hard, and he does all the little things. I knew the kid would make it
to the big leagues. I was hoping he'd have done it with us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chone Figgins didn't want to be rude to his mother and brother,
who flew here from Florida for his major league debut. So he escorted
them to the Boston airport Sunday night, then hurried back to the
team hotel and flipped on ESPN to make sure he really was the guy who
scored the winning run for the Angels. In his first major league
game, as a pinch-runner, he flew home from third on Eckstein's
squeeze bunt.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking, I've got to see this and see if it's actually for
real," Figgins said. "I got to get in the game and make a big impact
in the game. I couldn't even sleep."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Adam Kennedy hit .391 on the seven-game trip to New
York and Boston, raising his batting average to a season-high .309.
Outfielder Garret Anderson, who has led the Angels in batting average
in three of the last five seasons, is hitting .310. The last second
baseman to lead the team in batting average was Johnny Ray, who hit
.289 in 1989 .... Reliever Dennis Cook will begin a rehabilitation
assignment Wednesday at Class-A Rancho Cucamonga. Despite injuries to
his left shoulder, including a partially torn rotator cuff, Cook is
trying to return to the Angels for the final month, if there is
one.... The Angels still aren't sure whether outfielder Tim Salmon,
recovering from a badly bruised left hand, can join Rancho Cucamonga
for a rehabilitation assignment before the Quakes' season ends
Sunday.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A second-degree assault charge against Baltimore Oriole pitcher Scott
Erickson was dropped after prosecutors interviewed the player's
live-in girlfriend, prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   Erickson was arrested July 22 after an argument with Lisa Ortiz
that spilled out of their condominium and into a hallway and
elevator. He was scheduled to appear before a domestic violence judge
Sept. 6, but court records show prosecutors decided earlier this
month not to press the charges.</LD>
<LD>   "The victim was interviewed by the prosecutor, and her testimony
bordered on a recantation," state's attorney spokeswoman Marty Burns
said. "With no other independent evidence, the case just could not
proceed."</LD>

<TE>   The Boston Red Sox claimed outfielder Benny Agbayani off waivers
from the Colorado Rockies. In parts of five seasons, Agbayani has a
.273 career average.... The Oakland Athletics optioned rookie
right-hander Aaron Harang to triple-A Sacramento.... The San Diego
Padres will purchase the contract of right-hander Clay Condrey from
triple-A Portland before today's game at Houston.</TE>

<HD>Here's Some Sobering News About the Strike</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This might not be among your top concerns regarding the potential
economic impact of a baseball strike, but ...</LD>
<LD>   Stock analyst Carlos Laboy has studied the issue and concludes
that Americans will drink about 157,500 fewer barrels of beer if the
season ends early, Bloomberg News reports.</LD>
<LD>   Though many fans are below legal drinking age, Laboy based his
study on "an aggressive consumption estimate" of 48 ounces, or four
12-ounce beers, per fan.</LD>
<TE>   (No wonder you see fights in the stands.)</TE>
<TE>   The extra sobriety imposed by a strike would trim quarterly
earnings at Adolph Coors Co. by about a penny, and at Anheuser-Busch
by about a tenth of a penny, estimated Laboy, an analyst for Bear,
Stearns &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   The net loss for the beer industry would be $2.36 million, he
estimated. But even if the boys of summer pack up their gear early,
the boys of fall will provide another reason to drink.</TE>
<TE>   "The return of college and pro football, as well as the new TV
season, should create enough 'beer occasions' to offset a baseball
strike," Laboy said.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody will drink to that.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: When was the last time USC finished the football
season ranked in the top 10 in the Associated Press poll?</TE>
<TE>   Extra napkins: Fatburger is expanding more than waistlines.</TE>
<TE>   With the Santa Monica-based chain aiming to go nationwide,
Cincinnati Bengal tackle Willie Anderson says he plans to open 10
Fatburger franchises in the Cincinnati area and another 10 in
Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the biggest burger, man," the 6-foot-5, 340-pound Anderson
said. "You can pile on it. It's amazing."</TE>
<TE>   But not for you, Nate: This comment courtesy of Bob Ryan of the
Boston Globe:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to guess 30 months of a prison diet should help Nate
Newton slim down to under 300 pounds."</TE>
<TE>   Raider news: Kicker Sebastian Janikowski is back on Raider fans'
bad side after missing field-goal attempts from 36 and 33 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "An NFL kicker booed by the hometown fans in the opening quarter?
Of the club's first preseason game?" Ailene Voisin writes in the
Sacramento Bee.</TE>
<TE>   "The trouble with Sebastian Janikowski is that when he messes up,
he doesn't merely stub his toe. He falls face down and lands with a
thud."</TE>
<TE>   Playoff, please: Nebraska could play as many as 15 games this
football season--13 regular season, plus the Big 12 championship game
and a bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   "Effective immediately, no more using the burden of too many games
as a reason against a playoff," Mike Lopresti writes in USA Today.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen games?</TE>
<TE>   "One less than the Dallas Cowboys," Lopresti notes.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: USC was No. 8 in the final poll of the 1989 season
after beating Michigan in the 1990 Rose Bowl game with Todd
Marinovich at quarterback and Larry Smith as coach.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Wellington Mara, the octogenarian co-owner of the New
York Giants, still attends most of the team's two-a-day practices.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing," Coach Jim Fassel told the New York Times. "I love
this game, I've made my whole life at it, but I doubt at 86 years old
I will be out watching practice."</TE>

<HD>Cora Suffers Concussion in Collision</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Dodger shortstop goes to hospital for tests. L.A.
loses to Arizona, 6-3, in 12 innings as Gagne blows save for only
fourth time this season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 12 scary, silent minutes Monday night, nothing else seemed to
matter--not an entertaining game in which the Arizona Diamondbacks
eventually beat the Dodgers, 6-3, in 12 innings, not a rare blown
save by Dodger closer Eric Gagne, and not the threat of a strike this
Friday wiping out the rest of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Dodger shortstop Alex Cora was sprawled near the second-base bag
in the top of the ninth inning, face-first in the dirt and
motionless, after jarring his neck in a violent collision with
Arizona shortstop Tony Womack, and the 33,708 fans in Dodger Stadium
fell quiet, a queasy feeling rising in their stomachs.</LD>
<LD>   An ambulance entered from center field and Cora, who had three
hits, including a two-run home run in the fourth inning, was taken
away on a stretcher while Dodger Manager Jim Tracy, catcher Paul Lo
Duca and reliever Giovanni Carrara consoled Cora's wife, Nildamarie,
who was visibly shaken in front of the Dodger dugout.</LD>
<TE>   An inning later, the Dodger Stadium video board provided more
relief than Gagne and a stable of baseball's best closers could
provide in a season: Cora suffered a concussion and lost
consciousness for a moment, but he regained consciousness, was aware
of where he was, and could move his feet and hands.</TE>
<TE>   Cora was transported to Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles to
undergo more tests, but his injury did not appear as serious as first
feared.</TE>
<TE>   Cora had walked to open the ninth, and pinch-hitter Jolbert
Cabrera squared and missed a bunt. Cora had such a huge secondary
lead he took off for second, diving head-first right into Womack's
right knee and snapping his head backward.</TE>
<TE>   While Womack hopped around in pain, Cora hit the ground and
remained there while trainers from both teams rushed onto the field.
Cora was taken to a hospital, but Womack stayed in the game, which
the Diamondbacks rallied to win in the 12th.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Williams provided the game-winning hit--a bases-loaded RBI
single off reliever Guillermo Mota.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona tacked on two more runs on second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek's throwing error and Chad Moeller's RBI single as the
Dodgers' National League wild-card lead over San Francisco fell to 2
1/2 games.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were one strike away from ending Arizona right-hander
Curt Schilling's five-year stranglehold on them, and Gagne was one
strike away from setting a franchise record for saves when the
Diamondbacks tied the game in the top of the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne, who struck out the last two batters in the eighth inning
and the first batter in the ninth, gave up a single to Steve Finley
before striking out pinch-hitter Mark Grace for the second out.</TE>
<TE>   Pinch-hitter David Dellucci worked the count full, and with Finley
running from first on the next pitch, Dellucci roped a double into
the left-center field gap. Finley scored easily to make it 3-3,
handing Gagne, who has 44 saves, only his fourth blown save of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have not defeated Schilling since July 26, 1997.</TE>
<TE>   But Schilling, who began the game with more victories (21) than
walks (20) this season, seemed a notch below his usual self Monday
night, matching a season high with three walks while giving up three
runs and seven hits in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger starter Omar Daal, meanwhile, gave up only two runs and
five hits in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Daal blanked the Diamondbacks on two hits through five innings
before Luis Gonzalez reached on a two-out bloop single in the sixth
and Greg Colbrunn drove a two-run home run to left, his eighth of the
season, to pull Arizona within 3-2.</TE>
<TE>   Williams walked, and Daal picked him off first, but first baseman
Eric Karros' throw to second was high and wide, enabling Williams to
advance.</TE>
<TE>   Finley then singled sharply to left, and Marquis Grissom charged
the ball, fielded it cleanly and delivered a strong throw to the
plate.</TE>
<TE>   The ball tailed slightly toward the third-base line, but Lo Duca
caught it and shoved his tag into the sliding Williams to end the
inning and preserve the lead.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Dodgers sign Dominican pitcher Soto at reduced
rate of $150,000, even though he faked name, age.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers finally secured that 6-foot-2 right-hander with a 93-mph
fastball from the Dominican Republic, the pitcher who agreed to terms
on a $930,000 bonus in April. Only his name is not Jonathan Corporan,
his age is not 17, and his tax bracket is no longer that of a
near-millionaire.</LD>
<LD>   After four months of haggling with U.S. Embassy officials in Santo
Domingo, the pitcher who claimed to be Corporan fessed up, admitting
he is actually 21-year-old Reyes Soto and that Corporan is a younger
relative.</LD>
<LD>   Though Soto falsified his age and identity, frustrating team,
government and Major League Baseball officials for months, the
Dodgers still thought enough of Soto to sign him at the reduced rate
of $150,000 Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Soto should obtain a U.S. visa in time to participate in the
Dodgers' Florida instructional league in late September.</TE>
<TE>   "He still possesses a great arm and a lot of talent," Dodger
General Manager Dan Evans said. "We still got the same player we
scouted, with the same arm. He just truly is the player to be named
later."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers considered legal action against agent Don Nomura, who
is advising Corporan/Soto, but after numerous conversations with
Nomura and U.S. Embassy officials, team officials are convinced
Nomura was unaware of Soto's true identity. Nomura is out of the
country and was unavailable for comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were told by officials in baseball's Santo Domingo
office that since the federal government crackdown on immigration
documentation in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, there
have been 325 cases of false documentation by Dominican players--255
for age discrepancies and 70 for false identities.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger team officials--primarily Jeff Schugel, director of
international scouting and Luchy Guerra, senior manager of Latin
American operations--spent five weeks in February and March trying to
verify Corporan's age, even hiring a private investigator to assist
in the interviews of family members and school officials and to
research public records.</TE>
<TE>   They were convinced when Corporan agreed to terms on his initial
bonus that he turned 17 on April 21, but Corporan's application for a
visa in mid-May was denied because U.S. Embassy officials in Santo
Domingo had suspicions about Corporan's age and identity.</TE>
<TE>   Schugel took several trips to the Dominican in an attempt to clear
up the matter but was unsuccessful until Friday, when he and Pablo
Peguero, director of the Dodgers' Dominican Academy, took Soto to a
meeting with embassy officials in Santo Domingo.</TE>
<TE>   "They had pictures and documentation, and the kid finally came
clean," Schugel said. "It was quite an ordeal, but I'm glad we have
closure. He's the same guy we thought was Jonathan Corporan. He just
wasn't Jonathan Corporan."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Ishii Out, but Brown Not in</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kazuhisa Ishii is out of the Dodger rotation, at least temporarily,
but Kevin Brown isn't in--yet. Manager Jim Tracy said he will use
Thursday's off-day to skip the erratic Ishii in the rotation, while
Brown, who struck out nine in four relief innings Sunday night, will
remain in the bullpen.</LD>
<LD>   Brown's sinker and split-fingered fastball were lively Sunday
night, and his strong two-run, four-hit performance against Atlanta,
coupled with the five runs Ishii allowed the Braves in the first
inning, fueled speculation that Brown would replace Ishii in the
rotation.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm fielding questions based on what we saw [Sunday] night,"
Tracy said of Brown's 84-pitch stint, his third appearance since
returning from surgery for a herniated disk in his lower back. "That
was one time. I want to see that again."</LD>
<TE>   Brown walked two and made one crucial mistake, a two-strike,
two-out pitch that Mark DeRosa lined to center for a two-run triple
in the third inning. That extended Atlanta's lead to 7-4 in a game
the Braves eventually won, 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good, bad and ugly," Brown said of his performance. "I
would have liked to have gotten one other guy out, obviously. But
some good things did happen."</TE>
<TE>   Is Brown ready to start again? "I'm not going down that road," he
said. "Whatever they decide, they'll do. All I'm doing is whatever
they want me to do and whatever is best for the team. That's my job."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy wants Ishii, who is 13-9 with a 4.33 earned-run average and
a major league-leading 100 walks and has a 9.12 ERA in his last six
starts, to take some time to rest his arm and clear his head.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers won't need a fifth starter until next Tuesday night in
Arizona, and when Ishii returns, Tracy said it will be as a starter,
not a reliever.</TE>
<TE>   "This gives him a window of opportunity to reflect on some
things," Tracy said. "It's a chance for him to step back, see where
he's at and what he needs to address."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers recalled reliever Guillermo Mota from triple-A Las
Vegas Monday and optioned reliever Kevin Beirne to Class-A Vero
Beach, a move designed to strengthen their potential postseason
roster. By recalling Mota before Saturday, the lanky right-hander
with a 97-mph fastball will be eligible for the playoffs. Only
players on 25-man big league rosters or the disabled list on Aug. 31
are eligible for postseason play.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, the Dodgers will not activate reliever Giovanni
Carrara, who is on the disabled list because of a strained right
forearm, until Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Brian Jordan, on the disabled list because of a
protrusion in his lower back, took 40 swings of soft toss Monday and
could take batting practice today. Jordan said his back has loosened
up considerably the last two days, allowing him to increase the
intensity of his rehabilitation workouts.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I'm going in the right direction," Jordan said. Asked if
he was shooting to return by this weekend, he said, "It's realistic."</TE>

<KH>MIGHTY DUCK NOTES</KH>
<HD>Latest Trade Talks Center on Gratton</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks are talking with the Buffalo Sabres about acquiring
center Chris Gratton.</LD>
<LD>   Gratton, 27, had 15 goals and 39 points for the Sabres last
season. His best season was in 1996-97, when he had 30 goals and 62
points. He was the third pick in the 1993 draft, by Tampa Bay.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks would benefit from Gratton's size--he's 6 feet 4 and 226
pounds. The Ducks could part with a center as part of a deal. They
have depth at the position with Adam Oates, Steve Rucchin, Matt
Cullen, Andy McDonald, Samuel Pahlsson and Marc Chouinard.</LD>
<TE>   Any deal, however, probably will have to wait until an owner is
found for the financially strapped Sabres. In June, NHL officials
took control of the team's operations from John Rigas. The Rigas
family also owns Adelphia Communications Corp., which has filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Gratton will make $2 million this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks signed Rucchin to a four-year deal worth about $12
million Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin, 31, was once the center on the Ducks' top line but has
missed 108 of 162 games the last two seasons because of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   He had seven goals and 23 points in 38 games last season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pleased that the Ducks where confident enough to sign me to a
long-term contract," Rucchin said. "This is the place I wanted to
be."</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin would have been an unrestricted free agent next summer and
General Manager Bryan Murray said the team wanted to lock in the
center.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to find big, strong center-ice men," Murray said. "We
want to make a commitment to the guys who have been there and
performed well for this organization."</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin probably will yield some of his duties to Oates, who led
the NHL in assists last season.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's be honest, Adam is a great player," Rucchin said. "But we
have more balance now and I know what I can do. Teams won't be able
to key on certain lines."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Joffrey Lupul, the Ducks' No. 1 draft pick in June, will miss at
least part of training camp because of a hairline fracture in a
vertebra. Lupul will attend the Ducks' first rookie camp, which
begins Sept. 5 at Disney Ice.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping partway through camp that the doctors will allow him
to skate," Murray said. "We want to see where he fits."</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Negotiators for owners and players meet late into
the night in attempt to avert a strike on Friday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID and ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>With the clock ticking ominously toward the union's Friday strike
date, negotiators for owners and players met late into the night
Monday, looking for common ground on the pivotal issues of revenue
sharing and payroll tax.</LD>
<LD>   Neither side would comment on the specifics of their three
sessions Monday, but sources said they were conducted against the
backdrop of a militant group of owners urging negotiators and their
fellow owners to hold firm in the belief, as a person familiar with
the militants' thinking put it, "that the players don't really have
the heart to strike."</LD>
<LD>   That person added: "The hawks are trying to stampede the process,
but if they don't think the players will go out, they're making a
serious mistake."</LD>
<TE>   Paul Lo Duca, the Dodger catcher and union representative, had
expressed similar sentiments in a story that appeared in Monday's
editions of The Times, saying that management's bargaining position
was "getting to be a joke" and that some owners "think we're bluffing
[about shutting down Friday], but we're not."</TE>
<TE>   To what extent the militants have the ear of Commissioner Bud
Selig isn't clear, but they are definitely an 11th-hour concern to
the union, which would like to see Selig at the bargaining table.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said the union is leery of making further concessions
without assurances from Selig that owners will ratify a deal. Rob
Manfred, management's lead lawyer, has said that any agreement he
reaches with the union will be approved by Selig, but the union is
wary.</TE>
<TE>   Selig would need only 16 of 30 owners to approve a new collective
bargaining agreement, but it's believed that the revenue sharing
element would have to be voted on separately, requiring 22 votes, and
the hawks might represent an obstacle if they believe the
revenue-sharing plan does not transfer enough money from high-revenue
to low-revenue clubs.</TE>
<TE>   There are at least seven owners/club chairmen in the militant
camp. They include San Diego's John Moores, who has already expressed
his willingness to sit out a season rather than approve a bad deal;
Atlanta's Stan Kasten; Kansas City's David Glass; Minnesota's Carl
Pohlad; Houston's Drayton MacLane; Texas's Tom Hicks, and the Chicago
White Sox's Jerry Reinsdorf.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he would like to see Selig at the table, union leader Don
Fehr said, "I suppose he would be here if it's important to him."</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Manfred addressed the looming deadline and said, "At
some point, expressing to people that time is tight is sort of
something that you don't need to do. Everyone knows where we're at
right now."</TE>
<TE>   The negotiators have until about noon Friday to reach an agreement
or that day's games will not be played. It is believed the union will
not delay its walkout even if the sides are close.</TE>
<TE>   At Dodger Stadium on Monday, Lo Duca again stressed that the
players are unified behind Fehr and willing to risk the public
backlash to a strike rather than accepting a tax and revenue-sharing
agreement that would be tantamount to a salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the public perception, but if you've ever heard
[Fehr] talking to Bud Selig, it's like a college graduate to a
kindergartner," said the suddenly outspoken Lo Duca, a full-fledged
union man in his second full season. [Fehr is] not blindly leading
us. He's awesome. There's no better person we'd like to have on our
side."</TE>
<TE>   Management submitted a new proposal Sunday in which clubs would
share 36% of local revenue, an increase from 20% this season. Owners
had previously sought 37% revenue sharing and the union raised its
figure to 33.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Management's plan would transfer $263 million from high-revenue to
low-revenue clubs next season, based on 2001 figures.</TE>
<TE>   The union proposal would eventually transfer $242.3 million--but
only in the final year of the agreement. Its plan calls for
transferring $172.3 million in 2003, $195.6 million in 2004, $219
million in 2005 and $242.3 million in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   The payroll tax remains the biggest hurdle. Owners, determined to
slow spending of high-revenue teams, are demanding the tax that the
union, in conjunction with increased revenue sharing, views as a
salary cap by another name.</TE>
<TE>   Owners increased their threshold to $107 million in the first
three years of the new contract and to $111 million in 2006. Based on
projections, seven teams would be affected under those thresholds.</TE>
<TE>   The union has proposed thresholds of $125 million next year, $135
million in 2004 and $145 million in 2005. Also at issue is the
union's opposition to a tax in the final season of the deal, and the
tax rates.</TE>
<TE>   Owners want teams to be taxed at 35% the first time they exceed
the threshold, 40% the second time, 45% the third time and 50% the
fourth time. Players have proposed rates of 15% to 40%.</TE>

consecutive victory for the United States. In a quote that proved

POSTSCRIPT</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   By the time the Olympic basketball tournament began in Munich,
John Wooden had won eight NCAA titles at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Good enough credentials, one might say, to warrant selection as
coach of the U.S. team.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Henry Iba, a retired coach from Oklahoma State, got the
job. Although Iba had won gold in 1964 at Tokyo and in '68 at Mexico
City, and had an 18-0 Olympic record as the Munich Games began, the
combination of Iba's unpopular ball-control game and Wooden's success
prompted the question: Why not John?</TE>
<TE>   What occurred is best chronicled by Bill Wall, longtime coach at
MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Ill., who, for 18 years, was
executive director of the U.S. basketball federation.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the selection process for the 1972 U.S. Olympic
coach, the national basketball governing body was a conglomerate of
NCAA coaches, a few NAIA coaches, a large group of AAU coaches and
even some military basketball officials.</TE>
<TE>   "There were eight of us representing NCAA schools," said Wall, 71.
"Of those eight, three are still alive--me, Tex Winter and John
Bach." Winter is a Laker assistant and Bach a Washington Wizards'
assistant.</TE>
<TE>   "Against our eight were maybe 38-40 of the AAU and other factions.
They were dominant and their choice was Adolph Rupp. Ours were Dean
Smith or John Wooden."</TE>
<TE>   Rupp, the legendary Kentucky coach, was in failing health, Wall
said, the AAU faction recognized that, but did not want to relinquish
its voting power to the NCAA faction.</TE>
<TE>   "So Iba became the compromise choice," Wall said, "and with his
two gold medals already, we pretty much felt we could live with
that."</TE>
<TE>   That decision became a hot-button issue later, when Iba's team was
beaten in the most controversial gold-medal basketball game. The
Soviet team won with its last-second, court-length pass after the
clock had been reset twice and the Soviets given second and third
chances. Lefty Driesell, Maryland coach at the time, said then that
no Wooden-coached team would have even been in a tight, late-game
situation against the Soviets.</TE>
<TE>   Wooden said recently that he remembered talk about his being a
candidate, and that he would have liked coaching an Olympic team, but
that he never was familiar with the details.</TE>
<TE>   By 1976, the U.S. basketball federation control had shifted to the
NCAA coaches. Wooden had won two more NCAA titles and retired in '75.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember having a conversation with John about '76," Wall said.
"We were in a TWA lounge at the Chicago airport, and I asked him
about his interest in the '76 Olympic job. And he said he didn't
think so."</TE>
<TE>   So Dean Smith of North Carolina was named coach and--after a scare
from Marquette's Butch Lee, who hadn't had a chance to try out for
the U.S. team but scored 35 for Puerto Rico--won the gold medal.</TE>

<LD>The Houston Rockets signed point guard Steve Francis to a six-year
contract extension Monday, keeping him with the team through the
2008-09 season.</LD>
<LD>   The 25-year-old Francis is entering the last season of a four-year
deal worth just over $14 million. His new contract will pay him
between $80 million and $90 million over the six years.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-foot-3, 195-pound Francis was an NBA All-Star for the first
time last season, when he averaged 22 points, seven assists and seven
rebounds. But he's recovering from surgery on his right shoulder and
is treating an inner-ear disorder that caused debilitating headaches
last season.</LD>
<TE>   The injury and the headaches kept Francis out of 25 games. He said
Monday his ear treatment is going well and doesn't anticipate the
headaches to recur this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The San Antonio Spurs signed veteran center Kevin Willis. Willis,
who turns 40 on Sept. 6, averaged 6.1 points and 5.8 rebounds in 52
games for the Houston Rockets last season.... The Minnesota
Timberwolves signed point guard Troy Hudson to a multiyear contract.
Hudson averaged a career-high 11.7 points and 3.1 assists in 81 games
as a reserve for the Orlando Magic last season.... Reserve Orlando
center Steven Hunter tore a ligament in his right knee, and the Magic
said that he will miss four to six months.... The Toronto Raptors
exercised their contract option on forward Morris Peterson, keeping
him with the team through the 2003-04 season.</TE>
<TE>   College Basketball</TE>
<TE>   NCAA officials reportedly are investigating allegations of men's
basketball recruiting violations leveled against Lorenzo Romar's new
staff at the University of Washington. Gonzaga Coach Mark Few,
Eastern Washington Coach Ray Giacoletti and Washington State Coach
Paul Graham are allegedly upset over what were described as multiple
instances of contacts by Romar's staff, particularly assistant coach
Cameron Dollar, during "quiet" recruiting periods.</TE>
<TE>   Reports on the allegations were carried by the Seattle Times and
ESPN.com.</TE>

<LD>Former NFC rushing leader Jamal Anderson and the Super Bowl champion
New England Patriots are about to join forces.</LD>
<LD>   "We've agreed in principle" to a contract, James Sims, Anderson's
agent, said Monday. "It's looking pretty good."</LD>
<LD>   The Patriots, who are pleased with their three running backs,
wouldn't confirm an agreement with the unrestricted free agent who
spent eight seasons with Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   Team spokesman Stacey James cited a team policy of not commenting
on agreements or signings unless and until they are submitted to the
league and approved.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson led the NFC in rushing in 1998 with 1,846 yards and 14
touchdowns, his third straight 1,000-yard season.</TE>
<TE>   He tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee early the

knee on Sept. 30, 2001. The Falcons released him in June.</TE>

<TE>   Browns' quarterback Tim Couch took advantage of the Packers'
missing starting cornerbacks to complete 14 of 18 passes for 112
yards and a touchdown before leaving with a mild strain of his right
elbow.</TE>
<TE>   X-rays were negative, but Couch will undergo an exam today.</TE>
<TE>   The Browns dominated until Cletidus Hunt blocked a field-goal
attempt by Phil Dawson and Darren Sharper scooped it up and ran the
final 35 yards for a touchdown 19 seconds before halftime that
brought the Packers to 14-10.</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay took its first lead when fullback Chris Gall hauled in a
short pass from Doug Pederson and ran 35 yards for the score late in
the third quarter.</TE>

<DL>EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn.</DL>
<LD>The wife of Minnesota Viking offensive lineman Lewis Kelly died of
complications from her pregnancy, the second consecutive year the
team has suffered a preseason tragedy.</LD>
<LD>   Rakiva Kelly, 24, was four months pregnant when she died late
Sunday night, said tight end Byron Chamberlain, who along with Coach
Mike Tice was with Lewis Kelly at the hospital.</LD>
<LD>   "We had a tremendous tragedy," Tice said. "We're reeling a little
bit as a family."</LD>
<TE>   Last year, Pro Bowl tackle Korey Stringer died of heatstroke in
training camp.</TE>
<TE>   Right tackle Chris Liwienski, Stringer's replacement, said the
feeling in the locker room Monday was similar to the day Stringer
died.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a whole lot we can do, except be there for support,"
Liwienski said.</TE>
<TE>   Chamberlain, whose wife was a close friend of Rakiva Kelly, added:
"It's the hardest thing for a man to go through in life. Everything
was looking up in his personal life and for the team."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly had stepped in at left tackle in place of rookie Bryant
McKinnie, the team's first-round draft pick who is holding out.</TE>

<LD>David Bell hit a tiebreaking homer with two out in the ninth inning
and Jeff Kent earlier hit a two-run homer as the San Francisco Giants
defeated the Colorado Rockies, 4-3, Monday night at Denver.</LD>
<LD>   Bell hit a 3-and-1 pitch from Todd Jones (1-3) into the left-field
seats for his 18th homer.</LD>
<LD>   Felix Rodriguez (4-6) got the victory despite giving up a
game-tying home run to Jay Payton in the eighth inning. Robb Nen
worked the ninth inning for his 32nd save.</LD>
<TE>   Barry Bonds went two for four to raise his average to .358--one
point ahead of Colorado's Larry Walker for the National League
league. Walker got the day off to rest his dislocated rib.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 2, Chicago 1--Ben Sheets (8-15) pitched into the ninth
inning and Jorge Fabregas had a two-run double for the Brewers at
Milwaukee. The Cubs played without Sammy Sosa (strained muscle in
neck) for the second consecutive game. Mark Prior (6-5) took the
loss.</TE>

<HD>Odom Retwists Ankle</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Clipper forward expected to be out eight to
12 weeks, could miss season start.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM BARRERO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clipper forward Lamar Odom, who played in only 29 games last season
because of injuries and a suspension, has re-injured his right ankle
and could miss the start of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Odom, 22, on Monday had a cast put on the ankle, which he twisted
again during a recent rehabilitation workout, the team said. Tony
Daly, the Clippers' team doctor, said Odom's ankle had an
accumulation of fluid and swelling and recommended that Odom consult
with two foot-and-ankle specialists before settling on Monday's
decision.</LD>
<LD>   The injury is expected to sideline Odom eight to 12 weeks. The
Clippers open the 2002-03 season at Staples Center on Oct. 30 against
the Cleveland Cavaliers. Eight weeks would mean an Oct. 21 return,
and 12 weeks would be Nov. 18.</LD>
<TE>   Clipper spokesman Joe Safety said the 6-foot-10 Odom has been
working out this summer, primarily at Loyola Marymount, always under
the direct supervision of someone from the organization, including
coaches and trainers.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant trainer Robbie Davis even traveled with Odom to Rhode
Island recently, where the Clipper player was conducting a basketball
camp.</TE>
<TE>   Odom, who could not be reached for comment, originally injured the
ankle Feb. 14 while recovering from a sore right wrist. At the team
shoot-around that day, Odom dunked a basketball, stepped on it, fell
and suffered a high-ankle sprain.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sad," Odom said at the time. "There's nothing I can do about
it. It was a freak accident. I just want to do everything I can to
get back as soon as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Before the most recent setback, Odom had appeared to be on track
for a return to training camp.</TE>
<TE>   Odom, who also missed eight games last season for violating the
terms of the NBA's antidrug program, injured the ankle again while
dunking, but Safety said the player did not land on the ball this
time, only landing awkwardly on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Part of Odom's treatment includes an electrical stimulation device
in the cast to promote healing. The team will evaluate Odom's ankle
in four weeks to determine his progress.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that we've used that in the past," Safety said of
the electrical device. "It's designed so the player can return in the
optimum amount of time."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Odom set career lows with averages of 13.1 points and
6.1 rebounds and did not play after Jan. 18 against the Cavaliers,
when he scored five points in 24 minutes. He was put on the injured
list six days later and missed the rest of the season.</TE>

<HD>When a Loss Is Much More</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>All losses are not created equal.</LD>
<LD>   Not when you are the Angels. Not when your sporting resume is
filled with too many September collapses.</LD>
<LD>   Not when the season might stop on Friday, maybe for a day, maybe
for a week, maybe for a month, maybe for the season but maybe not.
Maybe it will really, really matter whether the Angels are in the
wild-card playoff spot Friday morning when a strike might begin.</LD>
<TE>   All losses are not created equal, not when you blow a four-run
lead in the ninth inning. Not when you are the team that was 129-1 in
the last 130 games where you led after eight innings. Not when you
lose to a team that committed four errors and a wild pitch. Not when
that team is on your back, fighting for a playoff spot too and has a
breeze of a September schedule and you have a monster one.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, with the best bullpen in the American League, with
that incredible ability to hold late leads, with a wacky and
fun-filled 8 1/2 innings of line-drive hitting and gleeful scoring,
with a four-run eighth that broke a 5-5 tie and seemed to break the
spirit of the Red Sox, at least in the bottom of the eighth when they
swung listlessly and retired themselves lazily, lost this critical
game at Fenway Park, 10-9, in 10 innings.</TE>
<TE>   All losses are not created equal. Not the one that is the
difference between winning a series, 3-1, against Boston and tying
it, 2-2. Not the one that is the difference between a 4-3 trip
against two of baseball's best teams, and a 3-4 trip.</TE>
<TE>   Not the one that is the difference between being a half-game ahead
of Seattle for the AL wild-card spot and a half-game behind. Not when
you might only have three games left until a work stoppage.</TE>
<TE>   Not when the Red Sox are dancing around their clubhouse, really
not sure Johnny Damon did lift that ball over the short fence in
right field off shell-shocked Scot Shields in the bottom of the 10th.
The Red Sox committed four errors. Throwing errors, dropped ball
errors, even a muff by super shortstop Nomar Garciaparra on the night
they passed out Garciaparra bobblehead dolls. Damon's home run was
almost merciful. When Troy Percival, your closer, the man who glares,
rares back and dares you to hit his 98-mph stuff gives up two hits, a
walk, two runs and the game in the bottom of the ninth, you crank up
the music and count your blessings.</TE>
<TE>   But on this night, if you're the Angels, you sit in silence eating
lobster from the claws and two pieces of Boston cream pie and say,
over and over, "a loss is a loss is a loss. This one is no better or
worse than any other."</TE>
<TE>   So said Manager Mike Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   And Scioscia has known just how to keep an even tone with this
team. He trusts his team to do the right things. That may not always
be good enough, but mostly they do the right things.</TE>
<TE>   Not Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   So many of his Angels let Scioscia down.</TE>
<TE>   In big ways, of course, like Percival and Al Levine, who put a big
bucket over Angel momentum by giving up leadoff singles to Manny
Ramirez and Cliff Floyd to start Boston's ninth. "It would have been
nice if Al could have finished the game," Scioscia said. Even nicer
if Percival had saved it.</TE>
<TE>   And in small ways.</TE>
<TE>   Even after the big collapse, Garret Anderson smashed a one-out
double off Boston closer Ugueth Urbina in the top of the 10th. Brad
Fullmer was intentionally walked. Troy Glaus just needed to make good
contact and score Anderson. He'd had two singles in the game. But
Glaus struck out. He wanted to go over the wall and not over the
second baseman. That's not smart. That's desperate because if the
Angels had taken one more lead over the Red Sox, it could have been a
heart-stealing lead.</TE>
<TE>   Percival stood and talked and said that, yes, "if you ask me 30
minutes after this, of course this loss seems worse than others. But
by tomorrow, it will be forgotten."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Spieizio, who made the Angels' final out with Anderson and
Fullmer on base, said that "If we go on strike and there's some crazy
thing where we come back and whoever's in first place and leading the
wild card goes to the playoffs, that's the way it goes.</TE>
<TE>   "If you lose by one game, you can go back through the season and
think of many games that can haunt you. But we're not there yet."</TE>
<TE>   In the worst kind of tape-delay purgatory, Angel fans who knew the
final score but watched the end of this game on television anyway,
about an hour after it was over, heard announcer Steve Physioc say to
Rex Hudler, "Hud, you can't beat the Angels with four errors and a
wild pitch."</TE>
<TE>   Whoops. That sound you heard was thousands of Angel fans throwing
stuff at the TV.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Scioscia is right. Maybe this loss is no big deal. Maybe the
Angels come back to Edison Field tonight and start a three-game sweep
of the bottom-dwelling Devil Rays while Seattle must go to AL
Central-leading Minnesota and the Red Sox must play the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe Boston Manager Grady Little is right. "This is probably
as high a peak as I've seen on this ballclub all season," he said.
And maybe Ramirez is right. "This is the most exciting game I've ever
played in my life," he said. That was the sound of the other side.
Some wins aren't created equal either.</TE>

<HD>Open Mind? Not When It Comes to Mr. Grumpy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've been kind of harsh on baseball players recently, forgetting they
are humans. So I'd like to take this opportunity to apologize to the
greedy (illegitimate children).</LD>
<LD>   "Do you think we're greedy?" Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca asked.
"Are we greedy just because you're not in our shoes?"</LD>
<LD>   Right away I volunteered to put myself in their shoes for a day,
suggesting I take the empty locker next to Kevin Brown and see what
it's like to be grumpy all day while earning only $92,500 a
game--whether I pitch or not.</LD>
<TE>   Now would I demand more money in uniform? You bet. I'm not sure
there's enough money in the world to convince me to sit next to a
dolt like Brown night after night. In fact I'd probably insist on a
private plane so I wouldn't have to fly with him to road games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I GAVE some more thought to Lo Duca's contention, however, that we
would all be doing the same thing as the greedy (illegitimate
children) if given the chance.</TE>
<TE>   "Say you had a 16-year-old daughter and you gave her a credit card
with a $1,000 limit and she wanted $5,000," Lo Duca said, and I told
him we could not continue the conversation because only a baseball
player could afford giving a 16-year-old kid a $1,000 limit and no
daughter of mine would dare ask for $5,000 knowing she couldn't spend
it while grounded for the rest of her life.</TE>
<TE>   I agreed to have an open mind, however. In fact I thought about
the carpenter, who allegedly agreed with three other friends to split
any profits from Barry Bonds' 600th home run ball if one of them
caught it.</TE>
<TE>   This is known as revenue sharing, of course, and we already know
baseball players want no part of that, and so when Jay Arsenault
caught the ball, he started acting like a major league player wanting
all the money for himself. Now there's a lawsuit and a restraining
order on selling the ball.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson here, of course, is never go to a baseball game with
friends, which really won't change my life.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT MAKES you wonder, though, if given the chance to get
richer--are fans any different than the guys they are cheering for on
the field?</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball is a reflection of the times we're living in," said
Dodger outfielder Shawn Green. "The bottom line in different
disputes--as always--is money."</TE>
<TE>   Now if you talk to everyday sports fans they seem very upset with
baseball players. Or are they? A group of fans started
mlbfanstrike.com three months ago, and called for a July 11 strike to
show baseball the fans mean business.</TE>
<TE>   They called for an Aug. 1 strike when the July 11 strike had no
impact on baseball, and have now called for an Aug. 29 strike because
the Aug. 1 attempt fizzled. The Angels will be at Edison Field on
Thursday, but it won't be the strike that keeps the fan count down;
they're playing Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Santaite, the West Coast representative for mlbfanstrike.com,
based in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., said Monday night, "it sickens me that
the two groups that are in charge of the game seem to forget the
people who support the game."</TE>
<TE>   Santaite said a sports bar in Baltimore recently sent a message to
baseball by setting up mannequins dressed as baseball players, and
then inviting the drinkers to pay $1 for a baseball to throw at the
mannequins.</TE>
<TE>   If the players strike, we're going to have empty stadiums and a
lot of folks suffering beer withdrawals. So we could have women and
children coming to the ballpark and dressing the mannequins with the
men paying to throw at them. This would be a natural lead in for
Fox's "Best Damn Sports Show Period!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WE THE Fans Who Love Baseball (wethefans.com), calling for a fans
revolution, has asked fans across the country to sign a petition on
their Web site to save baseball. So far 874 have responded. The
stated goal is one million.</TE>
<TE>   At takebackbaseball.com, the fans' movement is dedicated to
replacing Bud Selig. So far Cal Ripken leads the voting with 23.1% of
the vote, but right behind Pete Rose in sixth place sits Rosie
O'Donnell. I'm betting Rose has his money on O'Donnell overtaking
Ripken.</TE>
<TE>   Baseballfansunite.org called for a national walkout of fans,
beginning Aug. 20. That was a break for the Dodgers, because with
154,859 fans showing up over the weekend, imagine the logjam had
baseballfansunite.org not convinced so many to stay home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE GREEDY (illegitimate children) will take a charter flight to
Houston on Thursday to find their luggage waiting for them in a
four-star Four Seasons Hotel. They will get $73 a day for food, and
wait to learn if they will play or strike.</TE>
<TE>   (I always hate to mention the word "strike" around Marquis Grissom
because I expect him to swing and miss.)</TE>
<TE>   Someone asked Lo Duca quietly--so Grissom wouldn't overhear--if
there was a strike, might it extend into next season?</TE>
<TE>   "Then I'd be working for UPS next year," Lo Duca said.</TE>
<TE>   Frankly, I'd like to see a year at UPS a mandatory requirement for
all greedy (illegitimate children) who put on a baseball uniform--and
call me greedy, but two years for Brown, and then let's see how
grumpy he is.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Catherine Leary:</TE>
<TE>   "You do the Sparks a disservice with your petty, carping,
homophobic depiction of a particular group of attendees. Lucky for
you to see a GOOD looking blonde--you must have been starved with
your narrow-boy vision of who women can be and what they should look
like."</TE>
<TE>   The good-looking blond I referenced in my story was NBC's Chris
Wragge. A very good-looking man, I might add.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two World Cup winners and the man who once was Mexico's most-feared
striker found out the same unfortunate truth over the past couple of
days: Great players do not necessarily make great coaches.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Andreas Brehme, who scored the winning goal for Germany
in the 1990 World Cup final, was fired as coach of Kaiserslautern,
becoming the first to lose his job in a 2002-2003 Bundesliga season
that is barely three weeks old.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, Osvaldo "Ossie" Ardiles, whose play on the wing was
largely responsible for Argentina's 1978 World Cup triumph, endured
another downturn in his coaching career when his Racing Club was
hammered, 4-0, by Rosario Central in an Argentine league game. Racing
had lost, 4-1, to Independiente only six days earlier.</LD>
<TE>   Also Sunday, Hugo Sanchez, one of the greatest goal-scorers in
Mexican history and a five-time leading scorer in the Spanish league,
braced himself for a 4-1 thumping of his UNAM Pumas by Toluca in a
Mexican league match.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, it was not an inspiring weekend for the three former
players.</TE>
<TE>   Brehme, 41, played 86 games for Germany from 1984-94 and had been
a member of Kaiserslautern's 1998 Bundesliga championship team before
becoming its coach in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But the team, which finished seventh last season, was winless
after three games, losing, 3-0, to Borussia Moenchengladbach
Saturday, and Brehme paid the price.</TE>
<TE>   Ardiles too might soon be shown the door, based on Racing's 1-3
start in Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not considering resigning," Ardiles said Monday. "I intend
to work my way out of this situation."</TE>
<TE>   For Sanchez, the loss to Toluca, arguably the best team in the
Americas at the moment, was doubly galling. Only last week, he
blasted Toluca Coach Ricardo LaVolpe, saying he would personally make
sure that LaVolpe, a longtime rival, is not chosen to replace Javier
Aguirre as Mexico's national team coach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mexican Milestones</TE>
<TE>   Paraguay national team striker Jose Cardozo scored one of
league-leading Toluca's four goals against UNAM, thereby taking his
career total for the club to 150 and keeping him ahead of all other
Mexican league scorers, with seven goals in four games this season.</TE>
<TE>   Also reaching a milestone was Alex Aguinaga, the Ecuador World Cup
veteran who played his 450th game for Necaxa, which shut out Puebla,
2-0, on goals by Braulio Luna and Miguel Acosta.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Club America won its third in a row, 1-0, over
Santos Laguna on an 86th-minute goal by Cuauhtemoc Blanco.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Argentina Violence</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion and Argentine league leader River Plate scored
five goals in the first 33 minutes en route to a 6-0 victory over
Estudiantes, causing fans to riot briefly and throw debris on the
field. The game was halted by referee Fabian Madorran, but play later
resumed.</TE>
<TE>   That was not the case in the match between Banfield and Lanus,
which was called off after 23 minutes as Lanus fans clashed with
police, leading to the arrest of a dozen of them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A 60-Yard Goal</TE>
<TE>   Midfielder Pedrinho, a Brazilian who plays for Libertad in the
Paraguayan league, scored a spectacular goal during a 3-0 victory
over Copa Libertadores winner Olimpia on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing Paraguay national team goalkeeper Ricardo Tavarelli well
off his line, Pedrinho lofted a 60-yard shot that sailed over
Tavarelli's head into the open net without hitting the ground.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ahn Denied Permit</TE>
<TE>   South Korean striker Ahn Jung-Hwan, whose headed goal in overtime
knocked Italy out of the World Cup, has been denied a work permit by
the British government, thus ending his chances of joining Blackburn
Rovers of the English Premier League.</TE>
<TE>   Blackburn had offered Perugia of Italy $3.1 million for the
26-year-old forward.</TE>

<HD>Dixon Pays Tribute With Her Play</HD>
<DH>WNBA Finals: Spark guard, whose grandmother died at
midseason, says she was deeply affected by loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were times during the regular season that Tamecka Dixon looked
as if she wanted to be anywhere but on a basketball court.</LD>
<LD>   There were spasms of turnovers and bad shots. She was a non-factor
in late-season losses to Seattle and Houston.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Michael Cooper put her on the WNBA Western Conference
All-Star team, but her scoring average, 10.6, had taken a dip from
the 11.7 points she'd averaged in 2001. More telling was the shooting
percentage, down to .391 from .417.</LD>
<TE>   There were questions about her fitness. Dixon's feet had really
bothered her last year, and she began the season at less than 100%.
She was also experiencing pain in her joints, although she never used
it as a reason to sit out.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Dixon missed only two of the Sparks' 32 games, both
before the All-Star break, when she had to return home to New Jersey
to bury her grandmother, Bernice Dixon, who died after a yearlong
illness.</TE>
<TE>   The Spark guard said Monday that her grandmother's failing health
and ultimate death deeply affected her. "I grew up in a house right
around the corner from hers," said Dixon, 26, who was born in Linden,
N.J. "She helped raise me; she was in my life every day."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon said she never had a chance to grieve before hurrying back
to play in the July 15 All-Star game. "I felt I had to be strong for
the family," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of weeks ago, she said, she sat down in her apartment
with the lights out, and had a good cry. She said she also talked to
her grandmother's spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "I finally had some emotional healing," she said. "I know people
expect athletes to still come out and perform at a high level, even
after the loss of someone very special to you. But, for me, it was
hard to overcome the loss.</TE>
<TE>   "I was depressed for a while. My teammates did a great job of
trying to keep me up, and I tried to give them what I could."</TE>
<TE>   Since the playoffs began, Dixon is more her old self. She has
averaged 13.8 points in the four games but, more important, is
shooting again with precision, having made 22 of 41 shots. She is
scoring early in the game and late, knocking down three-pointers and
driving through defenses for layups.</TE>
<TE>   "I've dedicated the rest of my season to [Bernice]," Dixon said.
"I feel like somebody's been helping me right now, and I'd like to
think it's her."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DeLisha Milton will stay in the starting lineup for the
championship series against the New York Liberty, Cooper said. The
best-of-three series will open Thursday in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Milton was replaced by Marlies Askamp after the Aug. 8 loss to
Houston. Cooper said he wanted more scoring off the bench and
suggested that Milton could give the Sparks that kind of lift. Others
hinted that Cooper had been less than satisfied with Milton's
one-for-13 shooting against Houston.</TE>
<TE>   If Milton was upset by the change she kept it to herself, and the
Sparks won their final three regular-season games, clinching the
league's best record, then swept their first-round playoff series
against Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles beat Utah last Thursday in the first game of the
conference finals and Milton had a game-high 17 points. At Friday's
practice, Milton learned she was back in the starting lineup. She
responded with 19 points in the Sparks' 103-77 romp Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt we needed her energy against Utah, especially at home,"
Cooper said. "We had to come out and establish ourselves early. We
did that, and were able to get that series. Now we have to continue
that against New York.</TE>
<TE>   "The key in the series is how we play their inside people, [Tari]
Phillips and [Tamika] Whitmore. Phillips reminds me of a young Moses
Malone. She'll throw the ball on the glass to get it up there, then
get the rebound to get a better shot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's up to our big people, like DeLisha, to contain them. We
can't let New York outrebound us."</TE>

<HD>Williams Shapes Up</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Serena's skin-tight outfit steals the show on an
emotional first night of U.S. Open.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Everybody into the pool.</LD>
<LD>   Had the U.S. Open turned into "Baywatch?" Fashionista and
top-seeded Serena Williams, courageously clad in a skin-tight black
Lycra suit with a lot of leg showing, said not.</LD>
<LD>   "Of course not. This is more of a cat suit," she said. "It's not a
wet suit."</LD>
<TE>   This was a disjointed, if not magical, Monday night at the U.S.
Open. Shortly after an emotional, uplifting opening ceremony on the
Stadium Court honoring the heroes and survivors of Sept.
11--soundtrack by Tony Bennett and Queen Latifah and punctuated by
fireworks--Williams emerged looking like a biker, black leather
jacket over the outfit, took it off and morphed into Catwoman.</TE>
<TE>   Catwoman with pink shoes, that is.</TE>
<TE>   She had nine aces, hit 26 winners and defeated Corina Morariu,
6-2, 6-3, in the first round in 69 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me run faster and jump higher and it's really sexy,"
Williams said. "It really sticks to what type of shape you have. If
you don't have a decent shape, this isn't the best outfit to have."</TE>
<TE>   Many were left stammering for words, including television
announcers and Williams' opponent, Morariu, who was playing in her
first Grand Slam event since going into remission after being
diagnosed with leukemia in May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she looks great," Morariu said. "I mean, geez. You know,
I couldn't pull that off!"</TE>
<TE>   Morariu laughed. Minutes before, she cried in the interview room
when she was asked if she could have imagined being back at the U.S.
Open. Last year, she was here as a guest, looking pale and wearing a
bandana to cover her hair loss. She was in New York a few days before
returning home for more chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   "At this time last year I think I was getting ready to leave. I
get emotional just talking about it," she said, choking up. "So I
didn't think I'd ever be back here.</TE>
<TE>   "There are days when you feel so bad and things get so difficult
that you don't ever think you're going to be able to do the things
you used to be able to do."</TE>
<TE>   The best news Morariu could have heard came less than two hours
before the match. Her father, a neurologist, called her to tell her
the results of her bone marrow test from last week.</TE>
<TE>   "The cancer is still in remission," she said. "So that was the
best reason to celebrate for today."</TE>
<TE>   It was fitting that Morariu played in the featured night match on
the first day of the Open, considering the circumstances. "It was a
very emotional night all around," she said. "I was in the hospital on
Sept. 11 for two weeks. I watched every minute of television coverage
on it. It was hard for me. It didn't seem like there was anything
good in the world. I think we all have reason to celebrate."</TE>
<TE>   That was clearly the theme. Williams hugged Morariu at the net,
and later said it was difficult to play her friend. They spoke
several times during Morariu's battle with leukemia.</TE>
<TE>   Morariu's close friend and former doubles partner, Lindsay
Davenport, who had knee surgery in January, played her first Grand
Slam match of the year, beating Eva Dyrberg of Denmark, 6-2, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really excited for the tournament to start," said
Davenport, seeded fourth. "I felt like last week I made huge strides
in pretty much every aspect of my game."</TE>
<TE>   No one seeded among the first 16 lost. James Blake, seeded 25th,
had trouble against wild-card entrant Brian Vahaly. Blake won, 6-7
(3), 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (5), but cramped in the fourth set and needed
treatment on his shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "For a while, I was sneaking under people's radars," said Blake,
who won his first ATP tournament earlier this month at Washington,
D.C. "Unfortunately I don't think I can do that anymore. My hair
might be too long. They see me coming now. But I feel like there is a
little bit of pressure on me since there aren't as many guys coming
up like [Pete] Sampras and [Andre] Agassi when they were coming up."</TE>

<HD>If Nothing Else, Chang Is Realist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Self-doubt, a rare emotion for Michael Chang, surfaced months ago
when the former No. 2 in the world lost in the first round of a
challenger at Tarzana.</LD>
<LD>   "The low point of the low," said Carl Chang, Michael's older
brother and coach.</LD>
<LD>   There was no way Chang, 30, could have realized then that being
beaten by Brian Vahaly was not humiliating.</LD>
<TE>   Vahaly used the victory as a springboard, winning the event and
earning a wild card at this year's U.S. Open. Monday, he pushed James
Blake before losing in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Chang also used that loss to his benefit. He changed rackets and
started working harder than he had in the last year or so.</TE>
<TE>   The effort and the lower expectations resulted in a calmer Chang,
who won a match at the U.S. Open for the first time since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   It was typical in that it was not swift. He needed 3 hours and 13
minutes to eliminate Francisco Clavet of Spain, 7-6 (6), 3-6, 6-4,
7-6 (3).</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if people expect me to win anymore," said Chang,
ranked No. 132. "Maybe my attitude has changed a little bit. If I'm
able to go out and relax, I seem to play better tennis."</TE>
<TE>   This was only Chang's second victory in a Grand Slam tournament in
2002, and he was enjoying it, realizing it could be a last stand for
his generation.</TE>
<TE>   "We're definitely toward the twilight of our careers," he said.
"We want to give it our last good run, last good effort."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Youngsters Dinara Safina of Russia and Angelique Widjaja of
Indonesia have been assigned extra baggage, that often-cumbersome
label as player of the future. Safina, 16, is the younger sister of
2000 U.S. Open champion Marat Safin and won her first WTA tournament
title this summer at Sopot, Poland, on clay. Widjaja, 17, carries
stellar junior credentials--French Open champion, 2002, and Wimbledon
champion, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The teenagers each took a step forward, winning a main-draw match
at the Open for the first time. Widjaja defeated Anna Kournikova of
Russia, 6-3, 6-0, in 44 minutes. Safina beat Rita Grande of Italy,
7-6 (5), 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   Kournikova has lost in the first round at all four Grand Slam
events this year.</TE>
<TE>   The statistics were unique: Widjaja hit one winner, and Kournikova
had 40 unforced errors, nearly an error a minute.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just not there," said Kournikova, who left the court to a
chorus of jeers and boos. "I didn't play well."</TE>
<TE>   Away from the spotlight, Safina, had a more difficult route on
Court 8, fighting off two set points in the opening set defeating
Grande. Safina, who still wears braces, has the same charismatic
carriage as her older brother, as well as his two-handed backhand.
Her second-round opponent will be top-seeded Serena Williams, but
there does not appear to be an intimidation factor.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have anything to lose," Safina said. "I will fight. Maybe
I will win one set."</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Harris Has Handle on Problem</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Akil Harris understands better than most what he needs to do.</LD>
<LD>   Just hang onto the ball.</LD>
<LD>   He watched DeShaun Foster's reputation take a hit last season when
Foster fumbled four times against Ohio State. And he remembers how
Foster's fumble against Stanford helped the Cardinal on the way to an
upset of the Bruins.</LD>
<TE>   "DeShaun had problems putting two hands on the ball on traffic,"
Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you fumble, it's a sudden change. It creates momentum for
the defense and can change the whole outcome. You can lose the game."</TE>
<TE>   Harris, a junior expected to lead the way for UCLA's committee of
tailbacks after finishing last season with a 138-yard performance
against Arizona State, fumbled twice in a scrimmage Saturday when the
Bruins had seven fumbles.</TE>
<TE>   But he says he understands loud and clear what needs to be done.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to just grip onto the ball and think about ball first,"
he said. "The ball is more important than yards, anyway. We'd rather
have the ball than the yards."</TE>
<TE>   He attributed his fumbles Saturday to over-eagerness. "I never
looked in the ball on the handoff. I was thinking about a cut or a
big play before even getting the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Skipper, the Bruins' offensive coordinator and running back
coach, wasn't overly alarmed.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about his fumbles was they were on exchanges with the
quarterback," Skipper said. "He made a move, he saw a hole and he
made a move before he got the ball. He didn't cough the ball up.
That's the worst. This is on the exchange. It can be corrected
quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Skipper put the running backs to work Monday morning with an
extra-hard session on the gantlet, the anti-fumble drill where a
player must hold onto the ball while his arms and legs are battered
by the equipment as he runs.</TE>
<TE>   Skipper is confident the Bruins can take care of the problem.
(Freshman Tyler Ebell also fumbled twice in the scrimmage, dropping a
kickoff and a punt.)</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden guys are a little tired," Skipper said. "Now
you've got to concentrate more. It's that point in camp where fatigue
is getting the best of us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Pierre-Louis, a junior transfer from Glendale College who
had been battling Spencer Havner at weakside linebacker, will be
sidelined four to six weeks with a dislocated shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   This is the Bruins' first significant injury of the fall and is
particularly troublesome because they were already thin at weakside
linebacker.</TE>
<TE>   Havner, a redshirt freshman, has been a pleasant surprise--Coach
Bob Toledo singled him out after Saturday's scrimmage--but there is
no experience behind him. Wesley Walker, from Bishop Amat High, is
the only other scholarship player at the position.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive lineman C.J. Niusulu must appear in court for a
preliminary hearing on a felony battery charge today in his hometown
of Barstow and will miss practice.</TE>
<TE>   The charge stems from a July 17 incident at a Barstow drive-in
theater. According to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department,
Niusulu was in a fight and the victim required medical treatment for
facial injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Niusulu has been free since his arrest on a $50,000 bond and has
participated in fall camp.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's scrimmage Wednesday will be closed to the public....
Fullback Pat Norton, who sprained an ankle in Saturday's scrimmage,
is expected to be back for the first game Sept. 7 against Colorado
State.</TE>

<HD>USC May Feature a Nice Twin Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If all goes according to USC's plan, the Trojans will be able to
throw two sets of twins at opponents on the basketball court in the
near future.</LD>
<LD>   Lodrick and Rodrick Stewart, national top-50 recruits who will be
seniors this season at Seattle's Rainier Beach High, have committed
to USC. If the 6-foot-4, 180-pound twins follow through, they will
join Derrick and Errick Craven, who will be juniors then, for the
2003-04 season.</LD>
<LD>   The Stewarts have not signed letters of intent--the early signing
period begins in November--but their father, Bull Stewart, said his
sons liked the idea of helping Coach Henry Bibby build a basketball
tradition at football-conscious USC.</LD>
<TE>   "My boys are very unique," Stewart said Monday. "They wanted to go
to a program that wasn't at the bottom, wasn't struggling, but needed
some attention.</TE>
<TE>   "When I talked to Bibby, I could see that he was a class guy, a
great coach. He never pressured us at all. They run some pro sets and
play run-and-gun and that's what the boys like to play."</TE>
<TE>   The Stewart twins also were recruited hard by Washington and their
father told the Seattle Times on Saturday that they were set to
become Huskies under new Coach Lorenzo Romar, a former UCLA
assistant. They made their about-face in a live televised
announcement late Sunday night, after it was reported that Washington
was rescinding scholarship offers to both players. The Stewarts had
maintained that they were a package deal.</TE>
<TE>   Bull Stewart said his sons' word would be their bond.</TE>
<TE>   "The boys made a commitment [to USC] and it's a done deal," he
said. "Other coaches can see them and maybe say hello but that's it.
They have to focus on their academics and their senior season of high
school ball."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Lodrick, a shooting guard and small forward, averaged
17.9 points and Rodrick, a point guard and shooting guard, averaged
19.5 points as they led Rainer Beach to the Class 3A state title.</TE>
<TE>   Fordham transfer Jeff McMillan, a 6-8, 250-pound power forward,
began classes at USC Monday. He will sit out this season and be
eligible for 2003-04.</TE>

<LD>After a day off Monday for the start of classes, USC players will
begin studying Auburn in earnest as they prepare for their Labor Day
opener at the Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   Few, if any, anticipate the buildup as eagerly as middle
linebacker Mike Pollard.</LD>
<LD>   The fifth-year senior started the Trojans' first 11 games last
season, then sprained his left knee during practice before the Las
Vegas Bowl, missed the game and underwent off-season surgery to
remove cartilage.</LD>
<TE>   Pollard, who missed the 1999 season after undergoing surgery to
repair torn ligaments in the same knee, worked his way back last
spring and tested his leg's strength and stability during the first
days of training camp.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels great to be back out here, running around and bumping
into people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Starters from virtually every other unit have suffered injuries in
the last two weeks but Pollard and the first-string linebackers have
gone virtually unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   Melvin Simmons was slowed for a day because of a sore ankle, but
Matt Grootegoed appears recovered from a broken leg suffered last
season and Pollard is back at full strength.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be a pretty good group this year," said Pollard,
second on the team with 81 tackles last season. "We have some
experience and some talented young guys that look like they can help.
This is going to be a good season for the defense."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Nunn, who sat out most workouts last week because of a
hamstring strain, will take part in today's light practice and said
he is ready to earn the starting job at left cornerback.</TE>
<TE>   Nunn, a junior transfer from San Francisco City College, was
regarded as the leading candidate to replace Kevin Arbet when the
senior underwent season-ending foot surgery last week. Now, he must
displace freshman Justin Wyatt and hold off junior Marcell Allmond.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before Monday's day off, Coach Pete Carroll gathered his players
and reminded them to maintain their focus in the classroom and on the
field.</TE>
<TE>   They've spent the last two weeks poring over playbooks. Now, they
must mix in textbooks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a transition you have to deal with, and we have to deal with
it in a game week," Carroll said. "I just wanted to make them aware
of it so they are mindful of the decisions they make and how they
prioritize their time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Zach Wilson, a senior offensive lineman, is expected to return to
practice today after recovering from a foot strain suffered on the
first day of training camp. Wilson will work at right guard and right
tackle.</TE>
