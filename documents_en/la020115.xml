<AU>WILLIAM F. DEVINE Jr.</AU>
<BD>William F. Devine Jr., a Menlo Park attorney, is author
of "Women, Men and Money" (Random House, 1998).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the rush to declare a national holiday because there's a new
million-dollar coach who's not a white male, people overlook the
conditions under which the young players produce the product of
college football.</LD>
<LD>   Take Luke Powell, who scored seven touchdowns and averaged 19
yards per catch at Stanford for Coach Tyrone Willingham, perhaps
helping to attract Willingham's lucrative offer from the University
of Notre Dame.</LD>
<LD>   Powell's talents can help a team win games and capture a large
slice of college football's multibillion-dollar pie. In theory, he
should be able to capitalize on his talents by negotiating a
compensation package with his school and by striking a deal with
Adidas, a car company or anyone else who wants him to endorse a
product.</LD>
<TE>   In practice, he can't make any economic move because if he accepts
a penny more than his scholarship, the National Collegiate Athletic
Assn., college football's money police, will revoke his eligibility.
Apparently the NCAA thinks Powell should be grateful for his free
education.</TE>
<TE>   Yet how much of a player's opportunity for non-football education
is lost to the hundreds of hours he spends practicing, playing and
recovering from football? A lot--which means the education is worth
less than the NCAA thinks. And if Duke or Nike or Albert's Chevrolet
wants to pay for a player's abilities, why shouldn't he be able to
take the money?</TE>
<TE>   As Willingham demonstrated so adroitly, coaches can pocket
whatever the market will pay. So can university presidents, athletic
directors, NCAA officials and television executives. But not the
players. The industry makes clear they are not created equal.</TE>
<TE>   Why does this discrimination against college athletes persist? The
rules fix production expenses at a low number--a player only costs a
scholarship. The people who run college football like fixed costs
because fixed costs maximize the profits from which to pay the people
who run college football.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the comfort factor. Division I-A college
football's television networks, stadiums, coaches and revenue
stream--and many players--are of the highest caliber. Nonetheless,
college presidents can tell themselves they are educating youth, not
running professional football franchises in the world's largest
sports league. Lose the rules that prohibit paying the players and
the delusion is harder to maintain.</TE>
<TE>   This discrimination persists because no one acknowledges it.
Players are too young to perceive their exploitation, plus they love
to play, so they sound no rebellion. Fans don't notice the shackles
on the players' cleats. Universities rest behind mission statements
like Notre Dame's, which declares an intention to cultivate
"educated, skilled and free human beings." They don't mention that
they belong to a confederacy of schools that subject athletes to
quasi-antebellum restraints.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps an athlete with intelligence, cussedness and good advice
on antitrust and civil rights violations will sue a school and the
NCAA someday. Or perhaps the Collegiate Athletes Coalition or a union
will give players enough organization to strike over this
discrimination. College football bosses may then be forced to grant
athletes the freedoms everyone else in the industry enjoys.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the responsible way to react to Notre Dame's
announcement is to see the transaction for what it is: an institution
with a $3-billion endowment hired a guy already making more than
$500,000 a year and agreed to pay him even more money to run the
institution's entry in a multibillion-dollar industry that exploits
its laborers' talents, endangers their ligaments, denies them
economic freedoms, funds large salaries for university presidents,
athletic directors, coaches and NCAA officials, caters to television
and gives gambling interests a means by which to earn a terrific
profit.</TE>

<HD>Don't Let Korea Peninsula Peace Slip Away</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC J. HEIKKILA and GEORGE O. TOTTEN III</AU>
<BD>Eric J. Heikkila, an associate professor at USC, is
executive secretary and co-founder of the Pacific Rim Council for
Urban Development. George O. Totten III is chairman of USC's Korea
Project and political science professor emeritus.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As South Korean President Kim Dae Jung nears the end of his term in
office, a rare opportunity for progress toward meaningful peace on
the Korean peninsula may be slipping from our grasp</LD>
<LD>   By all reports, his "sunshine policy" toward the North--a
significant factor in the decision to award him the Nobel Peace Prize
in 2000--has been obscured by gathering storm clouds.</LD>
<LD>   It seems incredible that only 15 months ago North Korea's leader,
Kim Jong Il, was receiving the first U.S. secretary of State to visit
North Korea, and relations between North and South were thawing.</LD>
<TE>   Kim Dae Jung was eager to continue this momentum and hastened to
visit President Bush in March 2001, shortly after Bush assumed
office.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Dae Jung's hopes were quickly dashed as Bush made abundantly
clear his skepticism of any sunshine policy in light of the North's
lack of forthrightness with regard to its weapons programs and other
security concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Things only became worse after Sept. 11 as the U.S. drew a line
purporting to separate "the civilized world" from "the other."
Whatever one's view of the world at large, it is clear that the
Korean peninsula is one place where a bipolar division between north
and south is strongly evident.</TE>
<TE>   In every respect, these two entities constitute the yin and yang
of Korean national identity. Ironically, this bifurcation is an
outgrowth of a Cold War that is receding from memory elsewhere in the
world. Conditions should be right for an easing of relations, but the
tensions instead are being reinforced and buttressed by a new global
bipolarity. This situation is dangerous to world peace.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Dae Jung personifies a unique historical moment. His
demonstrated courage over decades of persecution by military
governments in South Korea are unlikely to be matched by his
successors, however distinguished they might prove to be.</TE>
<TE>   If Kim Dae Jung is unable to persuade his most important ally of
the viability of a sunshine policy, how can we expect any future
leader of South Korea to persuade its most steadfast foe that the
prospects for peace are genuine?</TE>
<TE>   Although the threat from North Korea is real, it is a mistake to
cast it in the same light as Al Qaeda or other terrorist movements
dedicated to the destruction of the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The real danger from North Korea stems from its paranoid view of a
world that it has become increasingly cut off from. Kim Dae Jung
understands that it is counterproductive to accentuate existing
polarities that only serve to reinforce the deep paranoia permeating
the North's leadership. He also understands that--with Seoul's 12
million people living at the very edge of this hostile divide--it
would be a mistake to let our guard down.</TE>
<TE>   The answer to this tense situation is to diffuse the existing
bipolarity rather than reinforce it. The key to such diffusion lies
with Russia and China, the same powers that helped create the
bipolarity that still defines Korea. The United States should work
with Russia and China to explore opportunities for regional economic
cooperation with North and South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the events of Sept. 11, which crystallized the new
bipolar order, also signified the end of the old one. Both Russia and
China now find themselves with the U.S. on the same side of the
freshly drawn line against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   There is also growing recognition of a commonality of interests
regarding regional economic development in Northeast Asia. This
potential would be boosted significantly through North Korea's
participation. It is in China's and Russia's interest to use their
influence constructively, and it is in our interest to encourage this
process.</TE>
<TE>   Let us take our cue from the winter solstice and not allow our own
cloudy thinking to eclipse the waxing potential of South Korea's
sunshine policy.</TE>

<HD>Bush to Lay: What Was Your Name Again?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD>Robert Scheer writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you believe President Bush, Kenneth Lay--one of his top financial
backers and his "good friend"--was merely an equal-opportunity
corrupter of our political system, buying off Democrats and
Republicans as needed. It is a convenient claim designed to unlink
Bush from the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history.</LD>
<LD>   But, as the good ol' boys in Texas--and now Bush spokesman Ari
Fleisher--like to say, "That dog won't hunt."</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Bush attempted to distance himself from the Enron
scandal by stating that CEO Lay "was a supporter of Ann Richards in
my run in 1994," obscuring the fact that Lay gave Bush three times as
much money as he did the Democratic gubernatorial incumbent whom Bush
was trying to unseat. Bush added that he really did not get to "know"
Lay--the man he nicknamed "Kenny Boy"--until after he won the
governor's race.</LD>
<TE>   I can't speak to the varying levels of intimacy of their
relationship, but Bush had considerable contact with Lay two years
earlier when the Enron leader served as the chair of the host
committee for the 1992 Republican convention in Houston, where Bush
the senior was nominated for his second term as president.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, Investor's Daily reported that "recently, Lay has
turned Enron into a corporate bastion for the GOP." After the elder
Bush's defeat, the Bush family switched its political ambitions to
George W.'s prospects for governor, and Lay came up with the first of
many contributions to that effort.</TE>
<TE>   Lay's loyal support of the Bushes may have been gratitude for the
decisive role that the first Bush administration played in Enron's
meteoric rise. Building on the Republican-engineered deregulation of
the electricity industry that began in the 1980s, Enron got a huge
boost during the first Bush administration with passage of the 1992
Energy Act, which forced utility companies to carry Enron's
electricity on their wires.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Lay publicly thanked Bush with a column in the Dallas
Morning News a week before the 1992 election. Calling Bush "the
energy president," Lay wrote that "just six months after George Bush
became president, he directed Energy Secretary James Watkins to lead
the development of a new energy strategy." That resulted in the
legislation making Enron's exponential growth possible.</TE>
<TE>   Lay was effusive in expressing his gratitude, writing that the
Bush "strategy is the most ambitious and sweeping energy plan ever
proposed."</TE>
<TE>   That gift to Enron was coupled with a major exemption granted by
Wendy Gramm, then chair of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission
in the Bush administration, an exemption that permitted Enron to
begin lucratively trading energy derivatives. Gramm then joined the
board of directors of Enron and served on its auditors committee,
where much of the false reporting now being exposed seems to be
centered. Her powerful role in the company did not stop her husband,
Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), from pushing through legislation that
further weakened government oversight of Enron's activities.</TE>
<TE>   After Bush the elder's defeat in 1992, the ties between Enron and
the Bush camp grew even stronger. In March 1993, Enron hired Bush's
Commerce secretary, Robert A. Mosbacher, and his secretary of State,
James A. Baker III, to line up contracts for Enron around the world.
As Enron's representative, Baker--later George W.'s Florida election
strategist--even went on a trip accompanying the ex-president to
Kuwait to do big business in the nation Bush had fought the Gulf War
to save.</TE>
<TE>   The trip was criticized by Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, who said that
he had turned down millions in proffered deals to do business in
Kuwait after the war.</TE>
<TE>   "I represent 540,000 American men and women, not some private
company," said Schwarzkopf. "They were willing to die in Kuwait. Why
should I profit from their sacrifice?"</TE>
<TE>   A decade later, the new Bush administration turned immediately to
Lay to get his bearings on an energy policy. Lay met with Vice
President Dick Cheney's energy group six times. This was no surprise,
given the close ties between Lay and Bush during the latter's days as
Texas governor. Consider, for example, that as governor, Bush did not
hesitate to call then-Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge and assure him that
Lay--then eager to deregulate Pennsylvania's electricity market--was
the finest of men, representing the most worthy of companies.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping true to family traditions, the president has always
aggressively supported far-reaching deregulation of utilities--it is,
in fact, his political mantra--and Enron appears to be the biggest
benefactor of that philosophy. Whether the contacts between them were
actually illegal and not merely an egregious betrayal of Enron's
employees, shareholders and consumers, it remains for the eight
investigations planned or underway to reveal what Bush and White
House insiders knew, and when they knew it.</TE>

<HD>When Going Gets Tough, the Tough Shred</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL SCHORR</AU>
<BD> Daniel Schorr, senior news analyst for National
Public Radio, won three Emmy awards for his coverage of Watergate.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was Watergate in the 1970s and Irangate in the '80s. Will
Enrongate become the national scandal of the new century?</LD>
<LD>   "Gate" has become a metaphor for the corrupt use of power. It
remains to be seen whether the Bush administration, consorting with a
giant corporation, contributed the regulatory laxity that made
possible the victimization of employees, investors and the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Now, as in the past, investigators will have to cope with the
cover-up impulse, which is not limited to government officials. For
months, the Bush White House has resisted providing the General
Accounting Office--the investigative arm of Congress--with data about
the workings of Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force, which
produced anti-regulatory policy recommendations much to Enron's
liking. The GAO has filed an unprecedented lawsuit against the White
House, trying to pry loose the information.</LD>
<TE>   Yet much of the information is buried in the files of the bankrupt
corporation and its accountants in the Andersen company. With a
free-enterprise whiff of Watergate, Andersen has now acknowledged
that "individuals" disposed of "a significant but undetermined number
of electronic and paper documents" related to Enron. The destruction
apparently continued after a subpoena had been received from the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   This "Quick-Henry-the-shredder" reflex took me back three decades
to June 1972. On the morning after five burglars had been caught in
Democratic headquarters in the Watergate office building, G. Gordon
Liddy, chief of the enterprise, drove to the office of the Committee
to Reelect the President on Pennsylvania Avenue and started shredding
files. He shredded everything connected with the project--including
hotel soap wrappers and even $100 bills from illegal campaign funds.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, L. Patrick Gray, acting director of the FBI, was
called to the White House and told by Nixon aide John Erlichman to
"deep-six" the contents of the safe of H. Howard Hunt, Watergate
operative, in the Executive Office Building. "Deep-six" meant that
Gray was to drop the contents off the Potomac bridge. Gray chose to
keep the material in his home and burn it six months later.</TE>
<TE>   The prize Watergate suppression was, of course, the erasure of 18
minutes of a discussion between President Nixon and Chief of Staff
H.R. Haldeman on a tape subpoenaed by the Watergate special
prosecutor. From the context it appears that Nixon and Haldeman were
discussing who ordered the break-in and why. Nixon denied making the
erasure. His new chief of staff, Alexander Haig, testified to some
possible "sinister force."</TE>
<TE>   Fast-forward to 1985 and the explosive revelation that the Reagan
administration had been dealing with the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's Iranian government to trade antitank missiles for Tehran's
help in recovering Americans held hostage in Lebanon. A further
development was that proceeds of the missile sales were diverted to
support the anti-Communist Contras in Nicaragua.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese ordered an investigation, and immediately
Oliver North, the National Security Council staffer managing the
enterprise, started shredding. Into the machine he fed paper copies
of electronic messages, telephone logs--everything.</TE>
<TE>   At one point the pile next to the shredder stood 1 1/2 feet high.
When the shredder jammed, North went around the building looking for
another secure shredder. North's secretary, Fawn Hall, spirited some
particularly sensitive papers out of the White House hidden in her
clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Adm. John Poindexter, head of the NSC, tore up the "intelligence
finding" bearing President Reagan's signature that authorized the
arms shipments.</TE>
<TE>   During the Clinton administration there was some shredding,
tampering and temporary removal of documents related to the
investigation that started with the failed investment in the
Whitewater Development Co. in Arkansas. White House counsel Bernard
Nussbaum was criticized for transferring Whitewater files from the
office of lawyer Vincent W. Foster Jr. after Foster's suicide.</TE>
<TE>   But, unlike Watergate and Irangate, Whitewater was not a scandal
that threatened the rights and livelihoods of Americans. Enrongate
could be such a scandal, and so it's time to take notice when you
hear the shredder at work.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Since seizing power in a bloodless coup more than two years ago,
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has been leading his nation out
of the camp of Islamic extremism. He speeded up the process in a
speech after Sept. 11, announcing a break  with the Taliban and
warning that Pakistan's survival would be jeopardized if it opposed
the United States. Last Saturday, with Pakistan on a war footing in
its conflict with neighboring India, he moved a step further and
pledged to crack down on Islamic radicals.</LD>
<LD>   Both of the televised speeches were courageous, and their
favorable reception by most Pakistanis should be an inspiration to
moderate Muslims. U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who leaves
today for a trip that includes Pakistan and India, called Musharraf's
latest address "bold and principled."</LD>
<LD>   Musharraf castigated those who seek to "propagate their own brand
of religion" and banned several groups thought to engage in terror at
home and abroad. His government has arrested hundreds more members of
banned groups.</LD>
<TE>   Musharraf's remarks in large part were aimed at India, at defusing
the renewed crisis over control of the Indian state of Kashmir, on
the India-Pakistan border.</TE>
<TE>   India welcomed the address but rightly demanded action as well.
The key will be Pakistan's dealings with the border guerrillas that
it considers fighters for freedom of the disputed territory. India
considers them terrorists. If Pakistan ensures that the fighters do
not cross from the part of Kashmir it controls into Indian-held
territory, New Delhi should be willing to hold talks.</TE>
<TE>   India mobilized its million-member army and moved hundreds of
thousands of troops to the border with Pakistan after five terrorists
attacked the Parliament building in New Delhi Dec. 13. Nine Indians
and the five attackers were killed. India said the assailants
belonged to two Pakistani groups that have carried out similar raids.
Pakistan banned both organizations but has refused to turn over other
men whom India has blamed for earlier acts of terror.</TE>
<TE>   Although pro-Taliban demonstrations were smaller than feared and
the president's two speeches were generally well received, Pakistan
still has a sizable number of Islamic radicals. This forces Musharraf
to move carefully.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan and India, separated in 1947 when both became independent
from Britain, have fought three wars, two centered on Kashmir. Now
both of the nuclear-armed nations would benefit from outside help to
get peace talks started.</TE>
<TE>   That's where Powell can come in, offering help and reassuring both
countries of the U.S. desire for good relations. Pakistan and India
need U.S. friendship and assistance. They can continue to earn it by
defusing tensions on the border.</TE>

<LD>The woeful Los Angeles Unified School District is taking what for it
is a radical step, belatedly making the sort of disciplined decision
that successful companies and agencies consider routine. The children
who receive an inadequate education due to district blundering and
timidity have reason to hope, now that top management has begun to
sweep out ineffective personnel at some of its worst campuses, as
first reported last week by Times education writers Duke Helfand and
Richard Lee Colvin.</LD>
<LD>   Last fall, state auditors identified 10 particularly bad schools
in the district. Supt. Roy Romer is now getting tough, in part to
satisfy state officials, who must prove to Washington that federal
dollars sent to California to help poor children are not wasted.
School districts that receive funding from a program known as Title I
must demonstrate measurable progress through rising test scores. That
requirement followed decades during which the federal government
spent money with little evidence that it did any good. Such
accountability will soon become even more demanding because of
education legislation signed last week by President Bush. It's about
time.</LD>
<TE>   The district has discussed major shakeups in the past, but
hyperprotective unions and meddling school board members always got
in the way. The change is possible today for two reasons. First,
voters tossed out most of the micromanagers on the school board (the
current board didn't even get a vote on Romer's plan). Also, although
no one will say so publicly, this time the teachers' and
administrators' unions, to their credit, are cooperating with the
superintendent.</TE>
<TE>   Such major campus shakeups should bring in a fresh team supported
by outside experts, eliminating a death-grip culture of failure
fueled by years of poor leadership, management problems, uneven
teaching and low or no expectations for students. The problem, as
Romer knows all too well, is finding outstanding principals and
teachers to replace those shoved aside.</TE>
<TE>   In this round of district reforms, only four principals will be
removed from the 10 targeted campuses: Avalon Gardens Elementary
School, Gompers, Mt. Vernon and Sun Valley middle schools, Mann
Junior High School, and Fremont, Locke, Roosevelt, Jefferson and
Wilson high schools. Classroom teachers can keep their jobs if they
sign a contract committing to higher standards and agreeing to
extensive retraining.</TE>
<TE>   The superintendent initially considered an even more aggressive
approach, but he knows that the district could not fill every
position, especially in the inner-city schools. Past mismanagement
has allowed some of these schools to deteriorate to the point where
restrooms are filthy and graffiti-plastered and unruly students rule
the classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   In education-speak, removing the top administrators and faculty
from a school is called "reconstitution," a practice already tried in
more than a dozen other states. Most companies or agencies would call
this "cleaning house."</TE>
<TE>   Finally the district seems to have realized the superiority of
this necessarily harsh tactic over the old, easy approach, in which
principals and teachers get paid and promoted even as students flunk.</TE>

<SM>LAUSD. The decision to remove principals and faculty from 10
schools in a school district where people tend to hold positions for
life should signal a firm unwillingness to tolerate the mediocrity
and excuses that have allowed failure to settle in on many Los
Angeles campuses. No one should fight these changes, and many more
schools should get similar treatment. Pollard. 76 lines.</SM>

<LD>It took 20 years for thousands of involved citizens and national
parks employees to hammer out the right plan for ridding Yosemite
Valley of smog, automotive gridlock and overcrowding, while
preserving access for all who want to visit. Rep. George P.
Radanovich (R-Mariposa) should not be allowed to undo it, despite his
power as chairman of the House national parks subcommittee.</LD>
<LD>   Radanovich toured the one-by-seven-mile valley the other day with
National Park Service chief Fran Mainella to lobby her to unravel
core parts of the plan, especially vehicle restrictions in the
valley.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview with The Times' Eric Bailey, Radanovich made the
silly claim that environmentalists "want to make the park so hard to
get into that people just won't come." That is not what the signed
and sealed plan will do. It will return parts of the valley to a
natural state by limiting parking spaces and relocating campsites. It
will establish a frequent, convenient shuttle system that should make
visitors happy that they were able to leave their cars in
out-of-valley parking lots.</LD>
<TE>   The plan will restore meadows, particularly along the banks of the
Merced River, and rid the area at the foot of Yosemite Valley of its
motor-and-foot-traffic madness. It will again be more natural wonder
and less urban blight.</TE>
<TE>   "No temple made with hands can compare with Yosemite," naturalist
John Muir wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Radanovich is carrying the views of tourist-related businesses
outside the park that fear that the plan will limit the number of
visitors and cost them profits. More likely, the plan, when
implemented over a period of years, will attract more visitors to a
more enjoyable and meaningful experience. The plan is for them, but
some merchants are likely to see more business as less.</TE>
<TE>   Since the destructive flood of five years ago, the Park Service
has carried out a heroic effort to make the valley a more natural
place. Rep. Radanovich has no call, and no right, to try to undo it.</TE>

<HD>'Beautiful Mind' Over the Usual Hollywood Matter</HD>
<DH>Mental health experts say the film's depiction of
schizophrenia is a welcome departure from the usual on-screen madmen
and, for once, rings true.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Princeton University math professor John Nash, Russell Crowe plays
a tormented genius who eventually triumphs over schizophrenia through
medication and sheer determination to maintain a truce with the
demons that haunted him as a younger man.</LD>
<LD>   To a public whose curriculum on schizophrenia has been limited to
Hollywood's comedies or thrillers, "A Beautiful Mind" may seem like a
fairy tale. But to mental health workers, academics and families of
those afflicted with the disease, the Ron Howard film got it
right--for once. "A Beautiful Mind" presents a rarely seen but common
outcome of the disease: recovery, or, at least, high-level management
of its symptomatic delusions and hallucinations.</LD>
<LD>   The Universal Pictures/DreamWorks Pictures film, they say, is a
welcome departure from mainstream depictions of the mentally ill
which casts people with schizophrenia as either oddballs with "split
personalities"--think Jim Carrey in "Me, Myself &amp; Irene" or dangerous
paranoids, such as Edward Norton in "Fight Club" (1999). Almost as
bad, they say, the disease was always portrayed as a degenerative,
lifelong illness.</LD>
<TE>   "And that was never true," said Sylvia Nasar, whose 1998 National
Book Critics Circle Award-winning biography of Nash became the basis
for "A Beautiful Mind." "The news of that hasn't gotten out in a big
way. Partly, because the only time we read about someone with
schizophrenia is if a couple of Capitol Hill officers are shot, or
someone is pushed in front of a train. The amazing thing about the
John Nash story is that it's making people aware. It's giving them an
entirely new view of who these people are who suffer from these
illnesses, and what the prospects are."</TE>
<TE>   While the film has been criticized for either eliminating or
fictionalizing parts of Nash's life, mental health experts praise its
truthful portrait of his schizophrenia. Depictions of schizophrenia
in popular culture have consistently perpetuated damaging
misconceptions about the disease--for example, that schizophrenia
causes personalities to cleave and multiply. In reality, the most
common symptoms of schizophrenia are audible hallucinations--hearing
voices. Schizophrenia is a neurological disorder most often treated
with a combination of drugs and therapy.</TE>
<TE>   Akiva Goldsman, who wrote the screenplay, said even basic
terminology is incorrect in most movies and TV shows. "People are not
schizophrenic," he said. "They have schizophrenia. The misconceptions
we have are rooted in older models of the disease."</TE>
<TE>   Goldsman, whose parents started a group home for emotionally
disturbed children when he was young, realized how little he knew
about the disease when he read Nasar's book.</TE>
<TE>   "I was stunned to learn about cases of schizophrenia that were in
remission," he said. "It is not at all the disease that people
thought it was decades ago. I have learned that this notion that the
disease is degenerative is not accurate. That's a kind of period
notion. That's what people thought in the '50s and '60s, but it's not
accurate."</TE>
<TE>   Raquel E. Gur, director of neuropsychiatry at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Medicine's Schizophrenia Research Center, said
more than half of the nonviolent individuals diagnosed with
schizophrenia eventually function normally with the help of
medication, therapy and a strong support system. But these
"mainstreamers" have received almost no attention in the mass media
as they are overshadowed by images of deranged criminals whose
situation becomes more dire and dangerous with time.</TE>
<TE>   Goldsman and director Ron Howard, who co-produced "A Beautiful
Mind" with Brian Grazer, cite films such as "Silence of the Lambs"
(1991) and "Primal Fear" (1996), about violent mentally ill people,
as examples of the direction they didn't want their film to take. As
Goldsman put it, they wanted to avoid "taking audiences to the zoo."</TE>
<TE>   "That's where there's the mentally ill person and then there's the
healthy surrogate, pointing at the mentally ill person, and we get to
watch," he said. "We wanted this movie to be from the point of view
of the person with the disease, so we couldn't objectify them. We
didn't want the safe island of having the normal person leading us
through."</TE>
<TE>   Audiences of "A Beautiful Mind" are placed squarely within Nash's
distorted reality. "We created a delusional system that was really
intact, because that's the way it feels--totally intact and fluid,"
Goldsman said. For the sake of accurately portraying that "system,"
Howard sacrificed significant parts of Nash's biography. Critics say
the result is a film that is often more cheery than comprehensive,
with long stretches of Nash's depression and a lengthy separation
from his wife completely excised. Even the diagnosis of one of Nash's
sons with schizophrenia is ignored. But Nasar said her book was
merely the basis for the movie, and Howard did not have to make "a
public service announcement."</TE>
<TE>   Nasar, a former New York Times staff writer who now teaches at the
Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, said even with Howard's
artistic license, the film has an essential truth.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no villains. There's no abusive father. No screaming
wife. No one caused it. That's so sophisticated," Nasar said of the
film. "For a long time, psychiatrists believed you never did recover.
That was an artifact of institutionalizations. That was before drugs.
People ended up in hospitals, and they didn't reemerge."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Howard became fascinated with genius and mental illness several
years ago when he got to know Yale Law professor Michael Lauder, who
was diagnosed with schizophrenia in his early 20s. (About 1% of the
U.S. population has been diagnosed with the disease, and men often
exhibit symptoms earlier than women, experts say.) Lauder credited
medications and a personal strategy with the ability to live in
concert with his vivid delusions.</TE>
<TE>   "He viewed life as a television screen, and he would move his
delusional lives to the corners of the screen, but he would have up
to four hallucinations going at the same time," Howard said. "He
began to trust what was in the center screen was real."</TE>
<TE>   But Lauder's carefully constructed world fell apart after his
father died in 1997 and he went off his medication. The following
year he murdered his pregnant fiancee and was sentenced in July 2000
to a psychiatric institution. He was 37 years old.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned a lot through my conversations with him, and that
specific journey," Howard said of Lauder's ability to train himself
to function in spite of his delusions--and the fragility of that
arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Howard read Goldsman's screenplay, he was eager to
refute pop culture mythology about the disease. He also recognized
similarities in how Lauder and Nash confronted their delusions.</TE>
<TE>   A trained mathematician, Nash developed the game theory of
economics in his 27-page doctoral thesis. But in 1959, when he was
just 31, he had a complete breakdown. He underwent intensive rounds
of insulin shock treatments--a since discredited treatment--and
therapy during a five- to eight-month commitment to New Jersey mental
institutions. He was released under orders to continue treatments of
antipsychotic drugs, but they numbed his senses, his affect and his
sexual drive. The cure seemed almost as bad as the disease, and Nash
was determined to logically "solve" the problem of his debilitating
illness.</TE>
<TE>   He is an example of a very select population, of geniuses who
present their own exceptional manifestations of the disease, said
Gur.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a marked, elaborate, delusional system," Gur said of Nash,
whom she has met. "I evaluated the Unabomber (Theodore Kaczynski),
and it is the same type of system, with elaborate details. These are
geniuses and they think big, even in their delusions. It's
commensurate with their intelligence and what they were doing before
they developed."</TE>
<TE>   Through sheer discipline, Nash began to ignore the cadre of
hallucinations that had run his life for a decade. He worked around
them, just as Lauder had.</TE>
<TE>   "I began to intellectually reject some of the delusionally
influenced lines of thinking which had been characteristic of my
orientation," Nash wrote in a 1994 biographical essay. (In the film,
Crowe describes the strategy as "a diet of the mind.") Nash currently
keeps an office in the mathematics department at Princeton.</TE>
<TE>   Nash's approach came at a time when the pharmaceutical industry
was coming out with more effective drugs whose side effects were
milder than those he had initially been placed on. Thousands of those
diagnosed with the disease benefited from these drugs starting in the
1970s, and they rejoined their original communities. Scientists were
given a large population on which to launch longitudinal studies. In
one, Nasar said, as many as 20% of those individuals showed
significant improvement by the time they had reached their 50s.</TE>
<TE>   So there was scientific data to suggest that Nash was part of a
long-ignored group of individuals who had recovered from
schizophrenia, a group whose story had never been told on film.
Howard sent Goldsman's screenplay to experts "for a vetting." He
hired a psychiatric consultant to come to the set. He also paid many
impromptu visits to his neighbor, a psychiatrist, who would talk to
him about the disease.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, executives at Universal were so confident about the
film's accuracy that they gave a copy of the film to pharmaceutical
giant, Pfizer Inc. Pfizer held a private screening of "A Beautiful
Mind" on Jan. 3 in New York's Tribeca Grand Hotel for 70 mental
health organizations and professionals.</TE>
<TE>   Among the guests at the Pfizer screening were Constance and
Stephen Lieber. Their daughter was diagnosed with the illness 25
years ago, and she remains on medication and works as an assistant
librarian in her father's office.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a wonderful film," said Constance Lieber, who
founded the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and
Depression after their daughter was diagnosed. "This has inspired
some debate among reviewers (for its simplified portrayal of Nash's
complicated life)," Lieber said, but noted that it brought to light
an illness " that has historically been shrouded in mystery and fear.
It creates awareness about one of the most misunderstood diseases."</TE>

<HD>High Court Drama, Not Quite Supreme</HD>
<DH>CBS' 'First Monday,' premiering tonight, has likable
characters and confronts tough issues but ultimately falls short of
expectations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It begins its sessions hearing these words: "God save the United
States and this honorable court."</LD>
<LD>   This is the nation's high court, after all, not "The People's
Court," "Divorce Court" or nine vamping, finger-wagging Judge Judys.
That means, subliminally, at least, there's an expectation of
something loftier than so-so "First Monday" when the U.S. Supreme
Court gets spotlighted in a weekly TV drama, even though these kids
put on their judicial black robes one sleeve at a time just like
their lower-level counterparts.</LD>
<LD>   You take what comes, though. It's "First Monday" that arrives on
CBS tonight in advance of resuming this week in its regular time slot
Friday. Talk about confusing. And yes, the title of this series from
producer Donald Bellisario ("Jag") refers to the court beginning its
year on the first Monday of October (even though this is January).
And, yes, this will be prime time's lone series about the high court
just briefly if ABC follows through on springtime plans to introduce
Sally Field as a new associate justice in its own weekly series "The
Court."</LD>
<TE>   The CBS protagonist, Joseph Novelli (Joe Mantegna), is also new, a
moderate liberal regarded as a potential swing vote as he mounts the
bench tonight with his colleagues, led by his friendly adversary,
conservative Chief Justice Thomas Brankin (James Garner). There's
even a "Curveball" news-talk show here, hosted by former CNN Supreme
Court reporter Charles Bierbauer.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, four young law clerks research case law to support
their bosses' positions. Brankin's man naturally has the smugness and
uniform TV generally associates with conservatives. Don't liberals
ever wear bow ties?</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's first case: A transgendering, asylum-seeking Mexican is
resisting being returned to his homeland, claiming he will be
persecuted there because of his sexual ambiguity. A cheap plot device
colors that.</TE>
<TE>   First crisis: Novelli, who opposes capital punishment for minors,
is asked to grant a stay of execution in Florida for a 16-year-old
death row inmate who was struck by lightning in the prison yard.
Condemned to death for killing a child during a robbery, the inmate
argues that to electrocute him now would be a double dose, the
equivalent of cruel and unusual punishment that's forbidden by the
8th Amendment. A plot convenience resolves that, and "First Monday"
rumbles to its final credits on some awkwardly contrived melodrama.</TE>
<TE>   First curveball: The justices mention "Old Sparky"--the nickname
for Florida's antiquated electric chair that once dispatched a man
with his hair in flames--in conjunction with the condemned teenager.
You'd think they'd know that "Old Sparky" was scrapped in 2000 by
Florida, which now offers a choice between electrocution and lethal
injection.</TE>
<TE>   To its credit, the series delivers appealing characters in Novelli
and his colleagues, and positions them to confront arresting legal
issues. These are not stiff types who speak only in legalese and
present arguments like PhD dissertations, by the way. Brankin, a
former college footballer, deploys sports metaphors freely.
Wheelchair-bound Justice Henry Hoskins (Charles Durning) is more than
a bit crude. And a female justice confides to a nervous Novelli: "I
wet my panties my first day on the bench."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of nerves, Bellisario is surely thinking: God save this
honorable court from cancellation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "First Monday" premieres tonight at 9 on CBS. The network has
rated it TV-PG-L (may be unsuitable for young children, with a
special advisory for coarse language).</TE>

<HD>A Canadian Import</HD>
<DH>Runaway production reaches a logical conclusion: Kristin
Kreuk, a star from north of the border.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kristin Kreuk has one of those dazzling faces you can't help but
notice, one that helped land the 19-year-old actress iconic roles as
the teenage Clark Kent's heartthrob Lana Lang on the WB series
"Smallville" and as the title character in "Snow White," an upcoming
ABC movie based on the classic story.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the growing ubiquity of Kreuk's face, which will receive
additional exposure in a Neutrogena ad campaign, is also partly a
creation of runaway production, a reminder of how the entertainment
industry's global pursuit of low-cost labor and tax incentives
carries with it various consequences, including the ability to launch
a career.</LD>
<LD>   That ready-for-prime-time face, you see, hides a small
secret--namely, that its owner was born and raised in Vancouver,
Canada, and has fast become a budding U.S. television star without
having shot a single frame on this side of the Canadian border.</LD>
<TE>   In that respect, Kreuk's story provides a snapshot of a larger
picture and a new twist on an old show-biz fable, one in which
getting "discovered" can just as easily mean being spotted at the
right high school in Vancouver as being seen at the right drug store
in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Canada has been a major beneficiary of efforts by American studios
to reduce the cost of producing TV programs and feature films, but
the impetus has been on finding less expensive crews and securing
Canadian government tax credits. Usually, U.S. actors still fill the
leading roles, with a preordained number of Canadians occupying
smaller parts.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, however, there is an unexpected discovery. In the
case of Kreuk (her surname, pronounced "Krewk," is Dutch), it came
when the producers of "Snow White"--which, like many made-for-TV
movies, was filmed in Vancouver--agreed out of deference to the host
country to audition some local talent for the part.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of done with a wink-wink, nod-nod, that this was a
courtesy," recalled writer-director Caroline Thompson, who said the
network and producers looked at a number of better-known actresses
for Snow White, in addition to casting Miranda Richardson as the evil
queen.</TE>
<TE>   In walked Kreuk, who at that point wasn't even sure she wanted to
make acting a career. Having appeared in school plays as "a hobby,"
she landed a part in a Canadian series, "Edgemont," when a casting
director called her high school. She didn't have an agent or manager
before being cast and went to the "Snow White" audition only because
her agent wanted her to meet the casting director. According to
Thompson, Kreuk simply blasted away the field.</TE>
<TE>   "She's just got that glow," Thompson said. "I was thrilled to find
somebody who was right for the part, who could do it with sweetness
but no sentimentality. Everyone was blown away by the screen test
that she did."</TE>
<TE>   Despite landing the role in "Snow White"--which ABC will broadcast
in March--Kreuk, then all of 17, still wasn't committed to acting
professionally. "After 'Snow White,' I wasn't sure. I thought I could
still go to school in the fall. I didn't know," she said during an
interview at the WB in Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   Kreuk spent the next few months auditioning for Vancouver-based
productions, and the pilot for "Smallville" happened to be one of
them. (The series airs on the WB network, which is part-owned by
Tribune Co., owner of the Los Angeles Times.)</TE>
<TE>   There was some question, initially, whether the series would shift
to Southern California, but the Warner Bros. production ultimately
stayed north, meaning those glorious shots of the Kansas heartland
where the young Superman comes of age are really captured in Canada;
in fact, Kreuk has never been within 1,000 miles of where the show is
ostensibly set.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been to L.A. and New York," she said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   The trend toward runaway production, of course, is no laughing
matter to those who feel their livelihoods being threatened, with
various legislative initiatives being advanced hoping to right the
perceived imbalance; still, the reality is that the allure of saving
money has given rise to a mature film industry in Canada, both in
front of and behind the camera.</TE>
<TE>   Although such productions as "Smallville" work hard to mask their
actual locations, that isn't to say lapses don't occur.</TE>
<TE>   "They always have to watch my 'sorrys' and my 'abouts,' because I
do speak Canadian," Kreuk said, noting that she occasionally is
forced to rerecord dialogue to amend her pronunciation.</TE>
<TE>   All this success has come rapidly for Kreuk, who lives with her
family and is grateful to embark on her career while remaining close
to home.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to be Julia Roberts, to have big starring roles, then
you have to work on projects in L.A.," she said. "If you just want to
work as an actor, there's a lot of opportunity just in Vancouver,
from guest spots to parts in series."</TE>
<TE>   Her representatives would doubtless like to be commissioning Julia
Roberts-type fees, but that may have to wait. "They know I don't want
to be down here all the time," Kreuk said. "I want to stay in
Vancouver, because that's my home. My manager might have mentioned
once or twice in passing that he'd love it if I was in L.A., but he
doesn't ask me to do that.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, [Vancouver] is where I want my home to be, and that's
where I want my roots to be.... In the meantime, I am more than
willing to go other places, because there's so much to learn."</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, however, there's no place like home for Kreuk,
even if she's not really in Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Smallville" airs Tuesday nights at 9 on the WB network. The
network has rated tonight's episode TV-PG-DV (may be unsuitable for
children younger than 14 with special advisories for suggestive
dialogue and violence).</TE>

Kristin Kreuk is winning over a U.S. TV audience on the WB's

runaway production hath wrought, she's done it so far without working

<HD>In the Age of Terrorism</HD>
<DH>Gathering at an international festival in Palm Springs,
filmmakers from around the world ponder the implications for their
craft.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL P. LUCAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PALM SPRINGS</DL>
<LD>The roiling geopolitical caldron is the raison d'etre for an
international filmmakers' caucus to be held Saturday at the Palm
Springs International Film Festival as directors, writers and actors
hash over the last year's events and discuss how they've affected the
business and their art.</LD>
<LD>   The caucus will substitute this year for the festival's customary
international filmmakers' panel, said festival program director
Jennifer Stark. The panel gave filmmakers a forum to discuss their
workaday problems, but Stark said it gave way this year to larger
ruminations on the moral implications of making movies in unsettled
times.</LD>
<LD>   So, as the festival plays at venues around town--featuring 160
films from 60 countries through Jan. 21--filmmakers are ruminating on
that, and on the always capricious American audience.</LD>
<TE>   "I make films to illuminate the human condition," said Indian
director Mira Nair, in town for a screening of her "Monsoon Wedding,"
a poignant, often funny story about family members' secrets coming to
light during a traditional Punjabi wedding. "I have people from
Southern California telling me my film is about their families."</TE>
<TE>   Such experiences point up a striking fact for many foreign
filmmakers: how much America has learned about being a member of the
global community since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans are being forced to grow up," Nair said. "You are
insular in many ways. There is so much demonization of 'the other,'
but now you are realizing that you are part of the other."</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a big change in audiences everywhere," said
Belgian actor Carlo Ferrante, who is attending the festival.</TE>
<TE>   "They seem to be more introspective," Ferrante said. "They are
more willing to examine deep subjects ... even in a movie like
"Amelie," people want romance, a chance to dream. We want to believe
that anything is possible."</TE>
<TE>   His reference to Jean-Pierre Jeunet's romantic comedy points up
perhaps the key dilemma: whether and how deeply to delve into
lightheartedness when so many social issues seem so urgent.</TE>
<TE>   Confirmed participants in Saturday's caucus include directors
Monika Treut, "Warrior of Light" (Germany); Matej Minac, "The Power
of Good" (Czech Republic); Juan Vera, "Son of the Bride" (Argentina);
Arpad Sopsits, "Abandoned" (Hungary); Danis Tanovic, "No Man's Land"
(Bosnia); and Gil Portes, "Bosom of the Enemy" (Philippines).</TE>
<TE>   Stark, who is assembling the roster for Saturday's caucus, said
that in some ways, the festival reminds her of working in the press
office at the Toronto International Film Festival during the height
of the Bosnian War.</TE>
<TE>   "We had filmmakers from Lithuania, Yugoslavia, Bosnia, Macedonia,
around the table ... and it was interesting to see how they dealt
with how their countries and cultures were being ripped apart and as
filmmakers how that affected them," Stark said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of the most successful recent films about Bosnia, "No Man's
Land," an Oscar submission from Bosnia for best foreign language
film, spryly weaves ironic levity into a story about the Bosnian War.
Tanovic drew inspiration from the death and destruction that raged
around him.</TE>
<TE>   "For one thing, any war is absurd. I think any killing of any
humans is just absurd.... I'm a pacifist in that regard."</TE>
<TE>   "No Man's Land" tries to strike a tone of black comedy and irony
to balance the dread and apprehension. "Making a film like this, it's
walking on the blades," said Tanovic. "I could easily fall into
theater, into comedy, which was not something I wanted. I could fall
into pathetic [tone], also what I did not want."</TE>
<TE>   Hardly a tougher subject exists than the plight of Afghans, the
subject of a festival entry from Iran, "Baran," a humanistic
treatment of a young Iranian construction worker's romance with a
young Afghan refugee.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to inject a lot of optimism ... and also there is a good
bit of humor in it," producer-director Majid Majidi said through a
translator. "But when you make a movie about the Afghani situation,
and the circumstances the refugees live under, it's a grim situation.
And I did my best not to make a grim film, but it's a grim subject."</TE>
<TE>   Some movie-makers at the festival think that the world--apart from
the neighborhoods where bullets and bombs are dodged--might be ready
for a new era of escapism.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, "the whole industry was a big question mark. Some
of the foreign market didn't have any buyers at all because nobody
knew what their countries would want," said David Albert Pierce,
co-executive producer of "Symphony of Silence," the Armenian
submission for the foreign film Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   "Now people want entertaining diversions from reality, and
Hollywood has always provided the source of that," Pierce said, as he
headed off to a screening of "Symphony," a drama with comic
undertones about an escaped mental patient who emigrates to America,
makes his fortune and returns home to buy the hospital where he'd
been held.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the films are displaying a little more humanity ... about
the way they depict violence and mass destruction, but if you take a
look at the films gearing up for production, people always have a
taste for ability to separate fiction from reality."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Palm Springs International Film Festival continues through
Jan. 21. The International Filmmakers' Caucus is scheduled for
Saturday at noon at a location to be announced. For information, call
(760) 322-2930. The festival Web site is www.psfilmfest.org.</TE>

<LD>   He Thinks the Lady Doth Protest Too Much</LD>
<LD>   Fox News Channel's combative Bill O'Reilly says Paula Zahn was
just being politically correct when she said she was offended by a
recent CNN promotion that described the morning news anchor as
"provocative, smart and just a little sexy."</LD>
<TE>   CNN management quickly yanked the ad, admitting it was a mistake
to describe a journalist in those terms.</TE>
<TE>   "If Paula Zahn doesn't think she's there partially because she's a
good-looking babe, then she's in never-never land," O'Reilly told
reporters in Pasadena over the weekend. Zahn, who left Fox News
Channel in September to join CNN, is an excellent broadcaster, the
talk show host said, "but Eleanor Roosevelt is not going to be
anchoring your weekend news, OK?"</TE>
<TE>   Composer's Tribute May Never Be Shown</TE>
<TE>   A lavish film production of the popular opera "Amahl and the Night
Visitors," with a six-figure budget, was to have been the jewel in
the crown of BBC2's Christmas programming last month and a way of
acknowledging the 90th birthday of composer Gian Carlo Menotti.</TE>
<TE>   Only one problem: At the last minute, the network discovered that
it had failed to secure the rights to the project.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Guardian Newspapers, BBC2 had to pull the program
and may never be able to show it. The screen rights belong to an
American company that hopes to make its own film version and will not
sanction another, the Guardian said.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not sure how the rights-checking procedure works or who
should have done it," a BBC spokesman said. "I believe the producers
were very surprised to find that they did not have the rights."</TE>
<TE>   Documentaries Get a Boost From Sundance</TE>
<TE>   The Sundance Channel, owned by Robert Redford and Showtime
Networks, is launching a digital cable network devoted entirely to
documentaries. They will run unedited and uninterrupted by
commercials.</TE>
<TE>   Redford said the channel, due to surface during the second half of
the year, represents an effort to give documentaries "equal
opportunity in the marketplace."</TE>
<TE>   "There [were never] many outlets for them, but documentaries have
evolved in quality and into a very compelling form of storytelling,"
he said. "I hope and believe [that] as documentaries move forward,
they will serve another purpose--especially those that deal with

<TE>   One Management, Two Voices, Moonves Says</TE>
<TE>   CBS and UPN are under the same management team, but they will
maintain two distinctive programming strategies, CBS President Leslie
Moonves said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Moonves, who was appointed last month to take over the struggling
UPN, said that UPN will not become "CBS 2."</TE>
<TE>   "That is absolutely not going to happen," he said. "The two will
have distinctive personalities with distinctive targets." However, he
added, development teams at both networks will be involved with each
other, and shows developed for CBS that appeal to a younger audience
might wind up on UPN.</TE>
<TE>   UPN and CBS are owned by Viacom Inc. and were combined last month
in an effort to cut costs and increase advertising revenue at UPN.
Moonves said that a new UPN president will soon be named to replace
Dean Valentine, who resigned Friday. Though ratings for UPN have
increased this season because of such shows as "Buffy the Vampire
Slayer" and "Enterprise," the network remains unprofitable.</TE>

<TE>   Angry McCartney Would Not 'Let It Be'</TE>
<TE>   The pop world got a reminder of Paul McCartney's long-standing
displeasure with superstar producer Phil Spector's 1970 arrangement
of "The Long and Winding Road" in a letter just released by the
British public record office.</TE>
<TE>   The scathing rebuke, sent to the singer's lawyer, Allen Klein,
revealed that McCartney hated the string accompaniment to the Beatles
single--the group's last No. 1 hit in America. Never, he said, would
that happen again.</TE>
<TE>   "In future, no one will be allowed to add or subtract from a
recording of one of my songs without my permission," McCartney said
in the correspondence, reported in the London's Guardian on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Spector, whose name will forever be associated with a string of
striking pop singles in the 1960s ("Be My Baby," "You've Lost That
Lovin' Feelin'"), worked on the Beatles' "Let It Be" album, which
featured "The Long and Winding Road."</TE>

<HD>Building Support by Example</HD>
<DH>Art * For LACMA's expansion, Eli Broad hints at the largest
gift of his philanthropy career--but the museum isn't relying only on
him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES ART WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eli Broad was buttoned-down and businesslike, as usual, as he ushered
a visitor into the inner sanctum of his foundation's offices on the
12th floor of a Westwood high-rise. He was ready to talk, at least a
little, about his part in underwriting the new building for the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art.</LD>
<LD>   "I expect to be a significant donor," he said. Instead of naming a
figure, he offered a clue: "Let me put it this way. It will be more
than our family has ever given to any other building, by some
margin.''</LD>
<LD>   Broad's promise means the museum's radical plan to demolish four
of its six buildings and replace them with a $200-million,
tent-topped structure designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas is off
and running.</LD>
<TE>   The amount of his donation won't be announced until the museum
kicks off the public phase of its capital campaign, and that won't
begin until more than half of the money has been privately pledged--a
process that could take up to a year. But Broad's hint a few weeks
ago indicates that his gift will top the $23 million his family has
contributed to the Broad Center for the Biological Sciences, under
construction at Caltech and designed by architect James Ingo Freed.</TE>
<TE>   "Eli has given me something to work with," the museum's president
and director, Andrea L. Rich, said last week. "I don't think it's the
end of what he will do, but it's a base of support that enables us to
start setting up other partnerships and arrangements."</TE>
<TE>   Other trustees "have made commitments to make commitments," she
said. The campaign goal has not been set, but it probably will be
around $300 million, including a big chunk for endowment, trustees
say, which is currently $82 million.</TE>
<TE>   Broad, who made his first millions in home building with the firm
Kaufman &amp; Broad, and the rest with SunAmerica, is widely considered
to be L.A.'s wealthiest philanthropist. He's credited with
kick-starting the campaign to raise funds for the Walt Disney Concert
Hall in 1997, when the project was stalled because of escalating
costs, and is a well-known advocate of distinguished architecture.</TE>
<TE>   He is also one of the world's leading collectors of contemporary
art, courted by dealers, curators and museum directors. Not
incidentally, his collection is the subject of a major traveling
exhibition that opened at LACMA in October.</TE>
<TE>   Given all that, he might be expected to provide the lion's share
of the money for the museum's transformation. But Rich contends that
"several major partners" must be involved. "It wouldn't be good for
this project to be bankrolled by a single person," she said. "Eli
wouldn't do it and shouldn't. The museum is a public institution. I
think it should be clear that this is a community project that is not
led by or dependent upon a single donor."</TE>
<TE>   She wants to make clear that no one knows exactly how the proposed
building will shape up, let alone who will foot the bill, but LACMA
leaders are steaming ahead on "parallel tracks," as she puts it.</TE>
<TE>   First, Walter L. Weisman was asked to serve an unprecedented
second term as chairman of the board. He and Rich are lining up other
trustees to solicit major gifts during the campaign's "quiet phase"
and to guide the effort when it goes public. "It isn't just me asking
for gifts," Rich said. "The trustees have to convince each other,
then roll up their sleeves and ask colleagues to join them."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the museum is negotiating a contract with the
architect, hiring a legal firm that specializes in architectural
development and seeking a Southern California executive architect to
work with the Koolhaas team.</TE>
<TE>   Fund-raising must keep pace with the building project, Rich
emphasized. But if all goes well, the process will take from five to
seven years, with construction likely to begin in about two years.</TE>
<TE>   LACMA--which derives about one-third of its $40.5-million annual
operating budget from the county--began developing its plans for
expansion and redesign with a $10-million county grant issued two
years ago to analyze the museum's physical problems, facilitate
improvements and increase public access.</TE>
<TE>   "That's extremely valuable money because it's hard to raise funds
for those things. You can't get going without it," Rich said, adding
that the remaining grant money will be used for design development,
but all construction funds will be raised from private sources.</TE>
<TE>   As for skepticism about raising money in an economic downturn, "we
are always in a recession or a boom; that's the way the economy
works," Rich said. "In a public institution, you just keep plugging
along in the boom time and the down time. It averages out."</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the best time," Broad said, "but hopefully the
recession will be over before the end of this year. People can give
to LACMA over five years, and they don't even have to make the first
payment until next year." Besides, he said, "if you look at the
Forbes 400 list, there are more people on it in Southern California
than there are in New York." (He ranks 26th on the current list,
published in 2001.)</TE>
<TE>   Broad contends that the resolution of the Disney Concert Hall
debacle bodes well--not ill--for the museum. "You have to remember
that we were able to raise over $200 million for a symphony hall that
many people considered dead and ready to be buried, or a black hole,"
he said. "Times were better then, admittedly, but we did it."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the specter of spiraling costs there and in other large
construction projects looms large at LACMA. "This institution does
not have deep pockets," Rich said. "LACMA can't afford major mistakes
that would draw on its operating budget. It's my job to make sure
that doesn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, plans submitted by the five architect finalists were
subject to review by architecture, construction and engineering firms
that provided their services to the museum without charge, Rich said.
"In some cases, two or three firms looked at plans, and we compared
their cost estimates. The two finalists, Jean Nouvel and Rem
Koolhaas, came back and met with our outside pro bono consultants.
Each of them argued about their differences with our consultants, in
our presence."</TE>
<TE>   The contract under negotiation now between Koolhaas and the museum
is further insurance, Rich said. The goal is to codify "a working
relationship that guarantees both the creative output and the fiscal
responsibility," Rich said. In all aspects of the building process,
it's essential to "draw up agreements early on, to avoid
misunderstandings later," she added.</TE>
<TE>   During the 18- to 24-month design development phase, Koolhaas will
work out details of the plan and the local executive architect will
make drawings to be used for construction. A construction firm will
analyze the drawings throughout the process, Rich said.</TE>
<TE>   While the superstructure of the new building has been established,
a great deal of discussion and planning will be needed to determine
the shape, look and flow of the galleries and installation of the
art. "This is an ego-less design," she said, noting that Koolhaas has
suggested bringing in other architects to design some of the
galleries.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps the major component of Koolhaas' plan for the interior
is the concept of change, she said. "This is the opposite of a museum
where everything is classified and set forever according to certain
rules. This is a design built on the one thing we know for certain,
which is that things change."</TE>
<TE>   Exciting as that may be for the museum's staff and visitors, it
presents problems in terms of recognizing donors. "You could put a
plaque on a wall, but the wall may move," as Rich puts it.</TE>
<TE>   "Finding appropriate ways of acknowledging founders and new
contributors in a dynamic environment is going to be a challenge, but
a fun one," she said. "I think people will buy into this not just to
have their names on the walls, but to be part of something that is
unique and aimed at addressing the future."</TE>
<TE>   Rich and LACMA's trustees say they selected Koolhaas' audacious
design because it is cheaper and more practical, flexible and
coherent than his competitors' relatively conservative plans. But
LACMA's leaders are also banking on the appeal of a bold
transformation.</TE>
<TE>   "People gave to Disney Hall because they became convinced that it
could become a symbol of the city, like the Opera House in Sydney,
Australia, or the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain," Broad said.
"This will have the same attraction."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is convinced that tearing down the old buildings or
spending $200 million on a new one is a good idea. Individual phone
calls and letters to the museum, the county Board of Supervisors, the
Los Angeles Conservancy and the press have criticized L.A.'s
tear-down mentality, or suggested the city needs better art more than
a better building.</TE>
<TE>   But the surprise is that, so far, there is no organized or
concerted opposition to the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still scratching my head about that," said Rich, who was
expecting a backlash. "I think the building has been an
embarrassment. Our strategic edge is the mistakes that were made in
the past. If we had a historic landmark, we couldn't even think about
doing this. But this is L.A. We can do it."</TE>

<HD>The Tokyo Quartet Rises to Brainy Challenges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Sunday, it was appropriate that the Tokyo String Quartet brought
Mozart's last quartet, a work in which the composer's creativity
moves at stupefying speed and complexity, to Caltech, one of the
country's great brain trusts.</LD>
<LD>   The opening pages of the Quartet in F, K. 590, unfold in
unpredictable but fitting ways at just about every bar. The
development section serves as relief from change and surprise rather
than, typically, an exploration of these qualities. At one of the
worst times of his oft-miserable and soon-to-be-over life, Mozart was
revising his peerless style, pruning, redirecting, challenging even
the best minds to keep up.</LD>
<LD>   The members of the Tokyo Quartet--violinists Mikhail Kopelman and
Kikuei Ikeda, violist Kazuhide Isomura and cellist Clive
Greensmith--didn't try to interpret it. They played it straight and
clean; they kept up with it.</LD>
<TE>   Their four-part concert--on the Coleman Chamber Concerts series in
Beckman Auditorium--included works that needed more interpretation,
however. Brahms' first Quartet, in C Minor, Opus 51, No. 1, which,
after intermission, followed Mozart, sounded contained and hermetic,
limited in dynamics and expressivity.</TE>
<TE>   The program opened with a single-vision performance of Schubert's
"Quartettsatz," the only surviving movement of a projected work and
the first statement in his mature quartet style. Next followed a
novelty, Webern's "Langsamer Satz," written in 1905. It is such an
early work, in such an uncharacteristically late-Romantic melodic
rather than 12-tone style, it could serve as a party-trick,
guess-the-composer question that would baffle almost anyone. At 11
minutes, it's personal, it's direct, it's competent--though it goes
on too long--but it's a dead end, and we can only be glad Webern soon
changed direction radically.</TE>

<HD>Historic WSM Decides to Stick With Country Music, Opry</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>After an outcry from country fans and music stars, the owners of
WSM-AM announced Monday that the historic radio station will continue
to broadcast country music and the Grand Ole Opry rather than switch
to an all-talk, all-sports format.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement by Gaylord Entertainment Co.'s Colin Reed ended
two weeks of heated speculation after word leaked that the company
was considering changes at the station where the Grand Ole Opry was
born in 1925.</LD>
<LD>   Opry members Vince Gill, Marty Stuart and Bill Anderson joined
Reed for the announcement. The stars, along with thousands of country
music fans worldwide, were against the change, and Reed said he had
been inundated with telephone calls and e-mails about the prospective
changes.</LD>
<TE>   A protest held last week outside the WSM-AM offices drew about 100
people, including country stars George Jones and Billy Walker.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been an outpouring of support from country music fans
and performers," Reed said. "The audience is there for country
music."</TE>

<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES DANCE CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 25-year-old Belorussian National Dance Ensemble Khoroshky stands
midway between the first-generation Slavic folk companies, with their
emphasis on costume spectacle and flashy technique, and more recent
innovators who prize thematic sophistication and refinement of style.</LD>
<LD>   Dancing a 20-part program on Sunday at the Cerritos Center for the
Performing Arts, the company exuded spirit and authority, projecting
the details of each piece with great vigor, so that it was impossible
to miss the tilts of head, shakes of shoulders or gestural specifics
that gave many dances their character--even in the elaborate costumes
on view.</LD>
<LD>   Company director Nikolay Dudchenko adopted many of the standard,
questionable stylizations of theatrical folk dance: putting everyone
of a particular social class into identical clothing, for instance,
and, of course, fostering the illusion that villagers are always 18
to 30 years of age.</LD>
<TE>   A sprightly, diminutive senior named Fydor Balabaika proved an
exception to this policy, but otherwise the company promoted a
musical comedy view of folklore--a view also occasionally evident in
Valentina Gayevaya's choreography.</TE>
<TE>   Her overly cute "Pictures of Bobruysk," for instance, showed
Belorussian Jews in rich velvets and satins dancing with thumbs
permanently attached to their lapels, while the use of a big corps
for "Kokhanochka" worked against the intimacy and romantic longing
she wanted to express. Half the people would make this dance twice as
effective.</TE>
<TE>   However, Gayevaya's Renaissance choreography offered aristocratic
splendor galore along with intriguing insights into antique sexual
politics, and she continually found ways to sustain entertainment
values without an overreliance on the inevitable squat kicks, barrel
turns and other outbursts of virtuosity a la Russe.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Gayevaya cranked up the bravura, soloist Vladimir
Stepanovich had drawn gasps with his impossibly high and easy
knee-to-nose extensions and the Khoroshky women had displayed
unusually fleet and precise footwork.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some Slavic ensembles in which males get all the showy
steps while females stay essentially decorative, complexity remained
a shared responsibility in the Khoroshky dances.</TE>
<TE>   Under the direction of Yuri Pshenichniy, a dozen tireless,
versatile, over-amplified singers and instrumentalists accompanied
the dancing and periodically performed on their own.</TE>

<LD>It was "the good war," a choice between freedom and fascism. So how
could thousands of Americans refuse to fight in World War II?</LD>
<LD>   The documentary "The Good War and Those Who Refused to Fight It"
(KCET, 10 p.m.), by filmmakers Judith Ehrlich and Rick Tejada-Flores,
tells the story of those conscientious objectors. The unpopular
battle fought by these pacifists has all the more resonance in
today's wartime climate.</LD>
<LD>   World War II united the nation like never before, but for
conscientious objectors, ethical or religious beliefs complicated a
seemingly clear issue. As objector Carlos Cortez put it, "I was
asked, 'What's a matter, you like Hitler?' I says, 'Look, if you
guaranteed me a shot at Hitler, you wouldn't have to draft me. But to
shoot at another draftee, one who I don't even know, one that I have
nothing against, no, the heck with that.'"</LD>
<TE>   Objectors often were scorned by their families as well as the
nation. Many chose prison instead of the camps where they were sent
to perform mostly menial tasks.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the objectors helped America in their own ways, the filmmakers
argue.</TE>
<TE>   As volunteers at mental hospitals, for example, they exposed
horrid conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Some risked their lives as guinea pigs in vital experiments. After
the war, objectors led relief efforts overseas, and at home they
helped spark the civil rights movement.</TE>
<TE>   This one-hour presentation of the San Francisco-based Independent
Television Service sheds light on an obscure historical footnote, but
it might have been even more illuminating if it weren't so one-sided.
OK, so the objectors weren't deviants warped by a "mother fixation,"
as a propaganda film suggested at the time, but how about a
thoughtful counterpoint from someone who doesn't see them as quite so
heroic, either?</TE>

<HD>A Novice Filmmaker Gets His Shot at the Big Time</HD>
<DH>Director Pete Jones made 'Stolen Summer' with some
well-heeled help, and a documentary crew captured every moment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>So there he was, 31-year-old Pete Jones of Chicago, director of the
moment, walking up the line of paparazzi who were shouting his name
as he posed for photographs alongside two of Hollywood's bigger movie
stars, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck--and in the kind of surreal way
that characterizes Jones' life these days, that seemed appropriate.</LD>
<LD>   It was Damon and Affleck, after all, who had helped pluck Jones
from obscurity by staging a nationwide scriptwriting contest with the
winner given a budget of $1 million from Miramax Films to turn that
screenplay into a feature-length film--the studio received more than
10,000 scripts. . The film Jones made, "Stolen Summer," is currently
being chronicled in a revealing 12-part HBO documentary called
"Project Greenlight" that's filled with tales of chaos on the set and
plenty of angry exchanges involving Jones, the producers, Miramax
executives, the crew--in other words, just about everybody associated
with the project.</LD>
<TE>   Now Jones was nearing the end of his curious odyssey, shadowed, of
course, by a documentary film crew which accompanied him here to the
Sundance Film Festival, where his family drama "Stolen Summer" was to
celebrate its world premiere last weekend. In a few minutes, a film
festival audience snaking into the Prospector Square theater venue
from the freezing cold would get the chance to judge for themselves
if Jones had been proven worthy, certainly by those who like to sniff
that they could have written a better script.</TE>
<TE>   Not unlike Professor Henry Higgins in "Pygmalion," Damon and
Affleck helped create him, and now reporters were asking if Jones
would come out of this contest a celebrity or had they, perhaps,
created a monster? Damon broke into a wide smile and motioned to
Jones, who had just arrived to face the paparazzi. "He wants to know
if you're going to come out of this a celebrity or have we created a
monster?" Damon said, breaking into a laugh as the Project Greenlight
crew filmed the exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "You know," said Jones with a stunned expression, "that's a tough
question to start out with! Can I go back?" Then, waxing earnest, he
replied: 'No, I wouldn't think that would be the case. I hope it's a
good movie. It's not about celebrity. It's about doing what you want
to do and doing it well and, hopefully, people respond to it. Does
that sound really cliche-ish?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's something refreshingly likable about this husky,
red-haired filmmaker whose appearance (no, he did not don a
Spielberg-like baseball cap for the event) screams Irish Midwestern
Catholic and whose humor reeks with self-deprecating wit. He admits
that if it hadn't been for "Project Greenlight," he would probably
have done what so many other would-be filmmakers do, "try to figure
out if I could try to steal a few grand here and there from friends
and family and try to make the movie myself in Chicago."</TE>
<TE>   So, might he have made it to Sundance anyway? Jones delivers a
boyish grin. "You know, I highly doubt I would have made it if I had
to do it myself. It helps to have the people that I had around me,
who were able to help with the script all the way through to the
editing."</TE>
<TE>   The documentary series--now in its midway point on HBO--shows what
a bumpy ride it's been for Jones since he started shooting his movie.
Jones says he's still getting used to being a quasi-public figure.
"It's weird," he says. "People come up to me on the street and say,
'Hey, you're the HBO dude!' or 'You're that "Greenlight" guy!' or
'Dude, you're an idiot!' But whatever it is, that's a strange thing
having people that you don't know say something to you. You think
maybe that would be something that would be great, but that is not
what it was about."</TE>
<TE>   Jones said he already is writing another screenplay, which is far
from finished. "I think Matt and Ben gave me my foot in the door, my
opportunity," he says. "Now, hopefully, my writing and directing
abilities will be able to carry me further.... It took me awhile to
learn the lesson, but I can't write the car chase, chase the girls,
those type of movies. I never could get the girls, that's why I can't
write it. I can only write those things that are from the heart or
about people I know. So, the next script is most definitely going to
be something from me, it's going to be semiautobiographical."</TE>
<TE>   The Project Greenlight film "Stolen Summer" has received such good
buzz here at Sundance that the producers added an extra screening to
the list. The film stars Aidan Quinn as a Chicago firefighter, who
has a loving wife, played by Bonnie Hunt, and a big brood. Their
8-year-old son, Pete, played with endearing personality by Adi
Lerner, becomes worried because his teacher, a stern Catholic nun,
warns him to clean up his rambunctious act or risk the wrath of God.</TE>
<TE>   So, the boy goes on a divine mission to prove his worthiness to
get into heaven by devising a plan to convert nonbelievers to
Christianity. Along the way, he befriends Danny (Michael Weinberg), a
7-year-old Jewish boy, whose father (Kevin Pollak) just happens to be
the neighborhood rabbi. The movie also features Brian Dennehy as
Pete's parish priest.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To watch the "Project Greenlight" documentary unfold week after
week on HBO is to ask, how in the world did this movie ever get made?
There were searing battles over financing. Almost immediately Chris
Moore, who produced the movie with Damon and Affleck, told Miramax
there was no way this movie could be made for $1 million, which
raised the ire of Miramax executives, who eventually relented and
raised the ante to about $1.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   There were also gut-wrenching moments when Jones wasn't sure if he
could get the cast he wanted. We first see scenes of him drafting
letters to Sean Penn and Emma Thompson, then later Quinn agrees to
come on board, but not without first throwing around some of his
muscle by demanding certain things, like who will be cast in the
female lead. On the first day of filming, the crew arrived at a
location under the elevated train in Chicago, called the El train,
but no one seemed to have factored in that the train comes roaring
past every five minutes, making it so noisy that the actors can't be
heard. .</TE>
<TE>   Poor Jones looked at times as if he were a condemned man waiting
for the executioner to throw the switch. At other times, producer
Moore could be seen screaming at the film's co-producers, wondering
how they had ever managed to get into this mess. Looking back, Jones
recalls: "That day (the first day of shooting) was a bad day and it
was my fault. You know, the things that you watch from the show, I
know the back stories to, so I'm not always thinking it's exactly the
way it was. Unfortunately, the day at the El was exactly the way it
was.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is something to be said that that scene [captured
by the documentary] is the only scene that is actually shot in
chronological order. If you look at it, it all happened in one day
and I think it beautifully encapsulated that day. The other episodes
go back and forth. That is why I have trouble, because I know there
is stuff missing from those episodes."</TE>
<TE>   Moore, who is alternately exasperated, angry, supportive and
bemused in the series, said, "There are surely people who are sitting
on their couches at home watching the documentary and saying, 'I
could do a better job than that idiot! How did this movie get made?'
But I think they are also watching this and are realizing, 'Gee, it
is hard.' There are a lot of things you can't control. Maybe you
couldn't have done better than us who do this for a living."</TE>
<TE>   Moore, who produced "American Pie" and "Good Will Hunting" among
other films, expects the experience has changed Jones. "I think Pete
learned what it's like to win a contest that has lots of people
shooting at him. Once you get in this business, part of the thing you
accept is you are now in the public. When you do something, people
are going to comment about it. Pete is learning a lot about
filmmaking and being famous."</TE>
<TE>   If the pressure of making the film wasn't enough, Jones' wife gave
birth eight weeks ago to their second daughter, Murphy. "The best
thing about it is is I would come back home at night and I'd be like,
'Oh, I got my butt kicked today.'.... I realized, 'you know what, I'm
starting to take myself too seriously.'"</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, just as they were shooting, Jones' father
underwent a triple-bypass heart operation. "[I thought] why am I
shooting a movie when my old man who has been everything to me is
sitting in a hospital?' That was tough, but you know what, we got
through it and everything worked out great and he's still with us and
my kids still get to enjoy their grandfather."</TE>
<TE>   At the premiere, Affleck reflected on the risky nature of the
project and the effect the documentary has had on Jones.</TE>
<TE>   "What's really interesting now is to see Pete not only have to
deal with this movie, having to be at Sundance, having to have his
career launched, but to be the subject of this television series,
sort of the star of it, in effect--and not as an actor but as your
real life.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, he's handling it well. Look, I have not ever been on a
movie where if there were a '[Project] Greenlight' show, a third of
the people would get stoned in the street in public by passersby.
Inherent in the process is a little bit of chaos, a lot of ego. It's
kind of like smelting down of things ... so you have this clashing
and the sparks that come from it that are what you get the art from a
lot of times.</TE>
<TE>   "People I think sometimes go, 'I can't believe this is how this
business works!' Relative to other movies, this movie went
splendidly. I think Pete did a fine, fine job."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the theater, as she waited in line to see "Stolen Summer,"
Tina Tovey of Sonoma, Calif., said she wasn't part of Sundance and
had just come to Park City to spend the weekend. But when told the
story of Jones winning the $1-million contest, she thought there was
something about it that reminded her of the old Hollywood, even
though she got the facts a little mixed up in the telling.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that's exciting is, you know, there's the story of
Betty Grable [it was Lana Turner] sitting at Woolworth's [it was
Schwab's drugstore] and being discovered," Tovey said. "You don't
hear those stories anymore, so whenever you see somebody who gets
this incredible break against millions of odds, it's really
exciting."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sunday night at CalArts, a barefoot, quietly bustling team of
performers-workers were busily realizing a piece called "Rain." In
the school's main gallery space, a layer of white dust was slowly
laid in a circle, akin to the sand mandalas made by Tibetan monks.
Next, a vast number of white helium balloons were anchored to form a
surreal, rubbery cloud formation overhead. All was eerily quiet,
except for the occasional "pop!" of an escapee from the balloon
population.</LD>
<LD>   For the official performance of the 45-minute piece, part of
California Institute of the Arts' fifth annual festival of
experimental computer music, the balloon clouds were made to dance by
tugs of the strings, all dramatically illuminated. Gentle, randomly
rhythmic, rain-like bleeps constituted the audio portion of the
program.</LD>
<LD>   What did this Dadaistic, hands-on piece--devised by Jacob &amp; Carol
(Jacob Joaquin and Carole Kim)--have to do with a three-day festival
sponsored by the Center for Experimentation in Art, Information and
Technology? As it turned out, its unique, process-oriented design
embodied much of what took place at the festival, which, in the end,
was mostly about a stubborn diversity of voices and ideas.</LD>
<TE>   The experimental-computer music world may still be a relatively
marginal and hidden dimension, but it's full of vigor. And that
increases the importance of a local venue like this festival. The
event, organized this year by CalArts faculty member Clay Chaplin,
has been a work-in-progress itself. It began as a student-sponsored
event five years ago; participants from around the world were
involved in this year's event, with programs Friday through Sunday,
and a loose after-party  Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Contrasts ruled. After the loopy softness of "Rain," Bob
Bellerue's "Threat Level Charlie" upped the angst as three musicians
bowed  pieces of plate glass, producing an aura of volatile
intensity, while also illustrating the medium-specific emotional
quality of sounds.</TE>
<TE>   Sounds and instruments were being radically tweaked and analyzed
all weekend. One of the best, and most darkly impressionistic,
laptop-based pieces was Michael Gendreau's "T921 pt. 2," an abstract
work made of found sounds from Taiwanese and Malaysian factories.
Gendreau gradually amassed sounds, suddenly cutting them off to
reveal just a low thumping, like an erratic heartbeat, to end the
piece.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony De Ritis' "Plum Blossoms" took as its source recordings by
pipa player Min Xiao-Fen, then scattered and reconstituted them into
an ultra-exotic construct. For composer Tae Hong Park's "T1,"
trumpeter Edward Carroll was on hand to supply simple gestures and
effects, while the composer processed his real-time labors into an
electro-acoustic swirl.</TE>
<TE>   In her keynote performance  Saturday, San Francisco-based Pamela Z
waved her "wired" arms to trigger sounds, created delay loops with
her voice (instant background singers) and a range of vocal tones and
percussion sounds, all while interacting with a video system that
allowed her to appear in triplicate.</TE>
<TE>   In Z's case, the centrality of her own over-the-top presentation
is hard to get around, and contrasts sharply with the almost ascetic
performance attitude of others in the experimental world.</TE>
<TE>   Perching at a mixing board, Joe Colley built a dense wall of
sound, in and out of which textures flowed. Although his
add-and-subtract process was simple, it was effective, and theatrical
in its own way.</TE>
<TE>   You could even say that Barry Schrader's pointed, teasingly brief
tape piece grew out of a laconic sense of theater, telegraphed
through a fragment of its title: "... an apprehension of something
sensed, not expected an impression of something experienced, not
remembered ... " Suffice it to say, contemporary experimental music
is going after ideas not easily contained in the usual hooks,
structures, isms or sound bites.</TE>

<LD>I just read "Report Confirms Secession Is Viable" (Jan. 10), on the
Local Agency Formation Commission for Los Angeles County's report
about the viability of certain areas breaking away from the city of
Los Angeles to form their own cities. I hope leaders in the city see
the growing momentum of secessionists as a wake-up call. It would be
a shame for the city to break into several parts. It is time for the
15 kings and queens who make up the City Council to quit working
solely for their own districts and start working together for the
betterment of the whole city.</LD>
<LD>   Quit the narrow-minded thinking and the political games that leave
a mayor virtually powerless and a city without efficient services
(including mass transportation for all residents). This city has
amazing resources that are squandered by politics, poor planning and
a government that doesn't work for the best interests of its
constituency as a whole.</LD>
<LD>   Charles K. Markline Jr.</LD>
<TE>   West Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The article reports: "The proposed Valley city . . . would remain
tightly entwined with Los Angeles for years. Los Angeles would
provide water, power, police and fire protection, road repairs, trash
collection and every other basic service under contract. A Valley
city would pay Los Angeles nearly $1 billion a year--just short of
its entire budget. A new city would employ no more than 36 people. It
would take more than 8,000 Los Angeles employees to provide services
to the Valley."</TE>
<TE>   So where's the self-support? The new city would be nothing more
than a shell for a bunch of malcontents to display their already
over-inflated egos.</TE>

once again offered only half-vast solutions in his State of the State

<LD>Re "Terror Trial Judge Wary of TV, Won't Rule It Out," Jan. 10:</LD>
<LD>   The very fact that Zacarias Moussaoui has asked for his terrorism
trial to be televised is good enough reason to see that it doesn't
happen. Doubtless he wants to be seen by his fellow cult members
around the world as a martyr so that he may incite them to further
acts of murder. And Court TV stands to make a fortune in the process,
so of course they think it's a great idea.</LD>
<LD>   The lawyers for both parties are asking Judge Leonie Brinkema to
overturn a ban on cameras in federal courtrooms so that their agendas
may be met, regardless of the platform it provides for terrorists and
the danger it brings to testifying witnesses. I say if a member of
the public can't get a ticket for a seat in the courtroom, he or she
can just as easily read the transcript of the trial after the fact.</LD>
<TE>   Brian Foyster</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I generally agreed with Bill Press' Jan. 6 commentary, "Televise
Moussaoui's Trial," but he failed to mention one most-important
reason for it and other terrorists' trials to be--if not actually
televised, perhaps for security reasons--at least videotaped. Having
such a record would be invaluable in years to come. The tapes can
later be released to the public when the reasons the authorities now
have for withholding them become no longer valid.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, Court TV may be requested to delay the actual airing
of any session by a day or so. This will permit editing out any
portions that are found objectionable. Court TV might readily agree
to a delay because it will be reinforcing what readers would then be
reading in the daily press and in magazines. The historic
significance for our children of actually being able to see such
events would in no way be diminished.</TE>

<LD>Re "Trade Center Site's Future Is a Prism of Plans," Jan. 13: Instead
of building a huge memorial, we need to rebuild the World Trade
Center, not to forget what happened but to show that we're strong. Of
course, a memorial would be necessary, but we need to think 100 years
from now, not 10. Children will read about how the attack shook
America and how we quickly recovered. Then they will visit the
memorial shortly before visiting the towers to learn about America's
economy. We cannot let such an important part of America's history
stay grounded.</LD>

<LD>Re "White House's Failure to Sound Alarm Faulted," Jan. 13: Criticism
of the Bush administration for not sending a warning to investors
about Enron's impending collapse seems more the product of political
motivations than sound reasoning. Putting the federal government in
the business of providing investment advice would surely create great
potential for mischief and conflicts of interest. Private investors
and their professional advisors are responsible for the wisdom of
their investments.</LD>
<LD>   The federal government is not without responsibility. If the laws
regarding disclosure are inadequate, the Congress can fix that. If
companies do not comply with the laws, the federal government can
take legal action. Best of all, the Senate should stop its
irresponsible behavior and enact meaningful campaign finance reform.
And the president should fix the National Labor Relations Board, if
Congress lets him, so that it enforces the Supreme Court's 1988 Beck
decision preventing unions from improperly using members' money for
political purposes. Without that, campaign finance reform would be
problematic. The culprit in this issue is really the Congress.</LD>

Clinton's presidency was sabotaged by conservatives who hated him for
his intelligence, humor and good looks. If George W. Bush's
presidency folds because, with his involvement in the oil business, a
conflict of interest appears, it is his own fault and not some plot
by liberals.</TE>

Enron?</TE>

<TE>   Was Bush's name involved in these transactions? Or how about the
other high-ranking officials who have since bowed out of the
investigation due to possible conflicts of interest; did they make
enormous profits selling shares as the everyday employees were
restricted from selling their shares as they slid from $80 to

<TE>   Re "Compassionately Conserving Enron," Commentary, Jan. 10:
Arianna Huffington is fast becoming the patron saint of fair play.
The Enron debacle is a microcosm of the Bush administration's
indifference to average citizens' endeavor to provide a cushion for
the autumn of their lives. Greed, the cancer of capitalism, must not
be allowed to run rampant while the members of the ruling classes
hide in their bunkers, counting out their millions. If "it's the
people's money," the slogan of the man who swaggered into the White
House, then give it back to the people who are now hurting. And watch
that "lockbox," the working man's last vestige of security.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "China Vows to Prosecute Bible Detainee," Jan. 9: What an outrage
that the country awarded the 2008 Olympics could quite possibly
execute a Christian for passing out Bibles to other Christians in
mainland China. As a young Christian in 1974, at the age of 22, I
found the Local Church in Miami. It was the greatest moment of my
life at the time. I moved to California in 1976 and have been
associated with the Local Church in Long Beach and in Anaheim--on and
off for a total of 28 years.</LD>
<LD>   I declare boldly that the Local Church is not a cult; the New
Testament Recovery Version, published by the Living Stream, is the
best version of the Bible I've ever read; and that Watchman Nee was
the greatest interpreter of the Bible of the 20th century. China
needs to be warned by all foreign governments, with the U.S. taking
the lead, that we will not tolerate this outrage and injustice.</LD>
<LD>   Your article stated it correctly, that the law drafted by China in
1999 is a "convenient tool for punishing other organizations." As a
fundamentalist Christian, I say now is the time to put a halt to a
worldwide persecution and slaughter of Christians, in which China
takes the lead.</LD>

<LD>Re "Crackdown Halts Bike Officers' Training on Dirt Trails in City
Parks," Jan. 9: As a member and a supervisor of the LAPD's bicycle
training cadre, I must say that Christine Peters' "alarming example"
is an embellished account of our training. [Peters lives on the
eastern slope of Elysian Park.]</LD>
<LD>   I attended bicycle training first as an officer in 1995 and then
became an instructor and supervisor in 2000. I have never witnessed
any unsafe training as a student or instructor. Quite the contrary,
the training is probably the safest thing next to firearms training.
The lead instructors are recognized throughout the country as experts
who are called upon to teach other agencies, and safety is always the
first and foremost concern.</LD>
<LD>   When the classes travel through Elysian Park the dirt trails are
pre-ridden to check for runners and other persons. If the ride is in
an area that is the least bit hazardous, instructors are placed at
points in the ride to assure the safety of the students and anyone
else who may be in the area.</LD>
<TE>   It's shameful that the training in our city has to be restricted
and taken away. We train less frequently because of fewer classes
and, when we do train, we are in the park at most 10 hours per month.</TE>

<TE>   It's OK that Peters hates mountain bikes. It's not OK when that
bias interferes with reasonable public policy. Denying the LAPD and
park police the opportunity to train in L.A. city parks is dogmatism
clouding sound judgment. That bias also led to the blanket ban on
mountain-bike recreation in our city parks.</TE>
<TE>   Do Peters and others really think that there is no place in L.A.
city parks for responsible mountain biking? Several of our larger
parks have trails that are perfectly appropriate for this safe, fun,
health-promoting activity.</TE>

writer was a charming host who welcomed us to the quaint eatery as if
it were his own kitchen. From a table that afforded him views of the
restaurant, he graciously introduced us to the owner and the head
waiter, both of whom hovered nearby throughout the meal and snapped
to Christy's side whenever the writer lifted his eyes above the
table. He told us this restaurant was his favorite. Overhearing this,
the owner said it was Al Pacino's favorite too.</LD>
<LD>   After quizzing us on our professional backgrounds, Christy told a
few stories from the old days at Town and Country magazine, where he
worked a quarter-century ago. He delighted in retelling the story of
meeting Alfred Hitchcock, who told Christy that he was locked in a
closet as a child, and said that Jimmy Stewart once confessed to
buying a Beverly Hills home to house his dogs. He dropped a few more
names. Moments later, he stood to greet two men leaving the
restaurant. These were important folks with Revolution Studios, he
said.</LD>
<TE>   Before we could ask, Christy raised the subject of his
controversial last few months at the Hollywood Reporter. His
otherwise bright demeanor darkened. "I am not an ogre!" he told us.
He had sharp words for former editor Anita Busch and former labor
reporter Dave Robb, who not only raised questions about his ethics
but quit in dismay over the publication's handling of the issue.</TE>
<TE>   According to sources, the allegations are the subject of a
continuing federal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   For 26 years, Christy wrote "The Great Life," a party column that
detailed the goings-on in Hollywood. Over the years, some studio
executives and fellow employees accused Christy of writing favorably
of establishments that picked up his hotel or restaurant tabs. They
also said that he'd refuse to cover an event without a studio's
agreement to pay the photographer of his choice and provide Christy a
limo.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Christy was accused of receiving Screen Actors Guild
benefits as a performer in films in which he did not actually appear.
At lunch, Christy detailed his portrayal of a strip club emcee in the
Farrelly brothers' 1996 comedy "Kingpin" as proof that he justly
earned his SAG benefits. His performance, he said, ended up on the
cutting room floor. (No one disputes he appeared in some movies; the
issue is whether he was credited for movies he did no work on.)</TE>
<TE>   These days, Christy writes a column for the Nob Hill Gazette in
San Francisco and works as a TV commentator on Canadian television.
He's also plotting a book. It's tentatively titled "The Whole
Enchilada" and, said Christy, "There will be real people in it. Some
people will be spanked. Maybe quite a few."</TE>
<TE>   Seeking Jay</TE>
<TE>   Actor Jason Mewes, who gained fame playing a stoned slacker in
director Kevin Smith's Jay and Silent Bob movies, is in legal hot
water. Last month, a New Jersey judge issued a $50,000 bench warrant
for his arrest when Mewes failed to appear at a probation violation
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2001, Mewes pleaded guilty to a felony heroin
possession charge, and was sentenced to two years' probation and
ordered to undergo substance abuse counseling and submit to random
urine testing. The probation violation hearing was scheduled after
Mewes failed to meet with his probation officer.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Michael D. Farren signed the bench warrant Dec. 14. As of
Monday, according to a prosecutor involved in the case, the
27-year-old actor had not been apprehended.</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote:</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why people are saying this.... They ask me about it
to my face, which I think is incredibly rude--they would never have
the gall to ask her. It's a horrible thing to say about someone. I

speaking to?" --Ewan McGregor, on rumors about an affair with Nicole

<LD>THE SHELL COLLECTOR</LD>
<LD>   Stories</LD>
<LD>   By Anthony Doerr</LD>
<TE>   Scribner</TE>
<TE>   224 pages; $23</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The short story is a dicey form for even the most experienced
fiction writer. Unlike a novel, where the author has room to take off
on tangents or introduce ideas that may languish with little damage
to the narrative whole, the short story requires perfect alignment
between character and plot, scene and dialogue; one wrong move on the
author's part and the entire work collapses. Though young writers
often work in the form as a proving ground, the difficulties in
executing a truly wonderful short story are many.</TE>
<TE>   This appreciation for the form's difficulty is what makes "The
Shell Collector," a show-stopping debut by 28-year-old Anthony Doerr,
so remarkable. His stories, filled with oddball characters, extreme
physical settings, splintered alliances and the incessant ache of
human sadness, is as close to faultless as any writer--young or
vastly experienced--could wish for.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing on a rich background in biology, hunting, oceanography and
fly-fishing, Doerr shows uncommon poise as he depicts the human
condition in many natural--and some not-so-natural--settings. He
conjures communities from the suburbs of Ohio to the wilds of
Tanzania, from war-ravaged villages in Liberia to a playground for
the wealthy on the Oregon coast, imbuing each tale with uncommonly
sharp writing and an incisive use of metaphor.</TE>
<TE>   The title story tells of an aged blind man living alone in a
thatch-roofed hut on the coast of Kenya who spends his days
collecting shells. By accident, he discovers that a snail known to be
potently poisonous and found in a particular type of cone shell may
have curative properties in treating a virulent form of malaria.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery thrusts him into the international spotlight and
onto a road he'd rather not travel. Forced by nearby villagers to
treat a young girl with the snail, the shell collector imagines "in
acute detail, the snail's translucent proboscis as it slipped free of
the siphonal canal, the quills of its teeth probing her skin, the
venom spilling into her." That which provides healing and ecstasy for
one, Doerr reminds us, can be poison to another.</TE>
<TE>   "For a Long Time This Was Griselda's Story" is the tale of two
sisters who live disparate lives: Griselda travels the globe in her
glamorous role as the onstage assistant to her husband, a sideshow
metal-eater, sending home postcards and letters, while dumpy Rosemary
remains in Idaho, caring for their mother, dreaming of the life she'd
missed, " ... mouthing the names on the stamps and postcards:
Molokai, Belo Horizonte, Kinabalu, Damascus, Samara, Florence." When
Griselda and the metal-eater return to town for a performance,
Rosemary's reunion with her sister makes for a spectacle not easily
forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   The strongest tale of the collection, "The Hunter's Wife," depicts
the reunion of an estranged couple after 20 years and is filled with
their back story. Here is Doerr at his finest, writing with beauty
and subtlety: "In a wind-polished bend they came upon a dead heron
frozen by its ankles into the ice," Doerr writes of the couple's
early winters braving the wilds of Montana. "It had tried to hack
itself out, hammering with its beak first at the ice entombing its
feet and then at its own thin scaly legs. When it finally died, it
died upright, wings folded back, beak parted in some final, desperate
cry, legs rooted like twin reeds in the ice."</TE>
<TE>   She, as a young magician's assistant, finds an abiding sense of
aliveness in the depths of this snowy, life-encroaching world. With
the hunter's guidance, she also discovers a unique gift: By touch,
she can communicate with animal spirits, especially those newly dead.
Anyone who touches her while she's touching the animal will feel and
know what she knows.</TE>
<TE>   The hunter, in this fable about the vicissitudes of married life,
is the opposite. He savors spring and fall, finding himself most
alive while fishing or hunting. His work involves the taking of life;
hers is to retrieve it. Her every action challenges his and
eventually rends the delicate fabric of their union.</TE>
<TE>   Reminiscent of Annie Proulx's wonderful "Close Range: Wyoming
Stories" and Andrea Barrett's "Ship Fever," Doerr's work combines
scientific understanding with narrative deftness. The traits he
brings to the work--an incredible eye for detail, a willingness to
let the tales unfold slowly and an utter lack of irony--are those
seldom seen in young writers.</TE>
<TE>   "The Shell Collector" illuminates both the riotous dangers of the
natural world and the rocky terrain of the human heart, thrusting us
into environments we can only hope to control.</TE>

<HD>Lose Weight Now ... That's an Order</HD>
<DH>Will Americans slim down for their country? Precedents
suggest perhaps not.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROY RIVENBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been a month since the government called upon all Americans to
lose 10 pounds as a patriotic gesture. So how are we doing?</LD>
<LD>   Many responded with a daily regimen of bench-pressing the TV
remote and jogging to the fridge during commercials, while others
simply ignored the request.</LD>
<LD>   In case you missed the original hubbub, it started when the
surgeon general issued a report skewering America's obesity epidemic.
Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of Health and Human Services,
promptly called a press conference and asked everyone in the United
States to shed 10 pounds as a show of patriotism.</LD>
<TE>   As you can see from the 1,200% rise in gym membership and shutdown
of all Hostess Twinkies plants, nobody listened, which is strange
considering that Americans usually hang on every word Thompson
utters. For example, his June report on "folic acid fortification"
captivated the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the problem is that Thompson didn't explain how this group
weight-loss plan might be accomplished. Will Vice President Dick
Cheney don a leotard and lead the nation in daily aerobics from an
undisclosed location? Will Republicans devise a faith-based
weight-loss initiative? Will supermarket tabloids publish an "Amazing
New Chain-Saw Diet"?</TE>
<TE>   Although the idea of a nationwide fitness regimen might sound
absurd, there are precedents. One is Tonga, where a 462-pound king
who dined on flying fruit bats and suckling pigs changed his ways and
inspired a mass dieting craze in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The other is Philadelphia, where a crusading mayor asked residents
to lose 76 tons in 76 days to overcome the town's reputation as "the
city of blubberly love."</TE>
<TE>   Before Tonga started shrinking its collective waistline, residents
favored such delicacies as butter-slathered yams, fatty mutton flaps
and whole loaves of bread filled with ice cream and drenched in
syrup. Well-heeled Tongans even flew in McDonald's hamburgers and KFC
fried chicken, according to news accounts. And King Taufa'ahau Tupou
IV tipped the scales as the Guinness Book of Records' heaviest
monarch.</TE>
<TE>   Then the beefy king turned into a royal Richard Simmons. He
power-walked around the palace with a military escort lugging his
throne in tow. He rode a yak-fur-covered bicycle five days a week and
exercised in a gym as two attendants fanned his royal sweat.</TE>
<TE>   All told, he lost 200 pounds. In 1995 he inaugurated a kingdomwide
fitness program, complete with prizes for lost pounds (vegetable
steamers, plane trips and cash), public scales donated by UNICEF and
mandatory aerobics in schools, according to reports.</TE>
<TE>   To make sure his subjects' weight loss was gradual and lasting,
prizes were awarded for "maintaining weight loss" and "reaching
healthy weight-for-height."</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to contact the king for this article were unsuccessful,
but a July story in the San Francisco Chronicle said the 83-year-old
monarch's weight had crept back up to 300 pounds, partly because he
suffers severe arthritis and now needs crutches to walk.</TE>
<TE>   As for the rest of Tonga's island kingdom, a 1999 article in the
Bulletin of the World Health Organization said a survey conducted
nine months after one weight-loss contest found that 69% of
participants had regained some or all of the pounds they shed.
However, the maintenance of weight loss by 31% was deemed "a
worthwhile achievement."</TE>
<TE>   Next up was Philadelphia. After Men's Fitness magazine branded it
America's fattest city in 1999, Mayor John Street hired a fitness
czar and challenged residents to lose 76 tons in 76 days. What City
Hall was shooting for was 30,000 residents, out of the city's 1.5
million, to lose five pounds each by July 3, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The city sponsored walk-a-thons and weigh-ins, and Street sampled
a vegetarian version of Philadelphia's famously fattening cheesesteak
sandwich to encourage healthier eating. The city also issued a
10-step fitness guide that urged residents to adopt one new habit per
week, starting with finding an exercise buddy and advancing to
drinking more water, eating more fruits and fiber, and taking time to
breathe deeply.</TE>
<TE>   The "76 Tons of Fun" campaign attracted international media
attention, including jokes from late-night comics who dubbed
Philadelphia "the city of brotherly love handles."</TE>
<TE>   Men's Fitness has since bumped Philadelphia down to No. 4 on its
flab index. Houston, which is now No. 1, sent a delegation to
Philadelphia so it could copy the city's fitness plan.</TE>
<TE>   However, Philly's program wasn't exactly a raging success. Instead
of losing 76 tons, participants shed a mere 6,000 pounds, says the
mayor's spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us back to Tommy Thompson's suggestion that all
Americans drop 10 pounds. If 30,000 Philadelphians have trouble
erasing 76 tons, can 280 million Americans lose 1.4 million tons?</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you have to start someplace," says Thompson's spokesman
Bill Pierce. "You can't let the daunting nature of things stop you
from trying."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at Surgeon General David Satcher's office, calls are
trickling in from schools, businesses and church groups asking how
they can encourage members to lose weight.</TE>
<TE>   But a Tonga-style program isn't likely. "We're not going to be
going out and weighing America," Pierce says.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, others are only too happy to pick up where the surgeon
general leaves off.</TE>
<TE>   The day after Satcher's report came out, St. Louis University
touted a study showing that cities that build trails, encourage
walking programs at malls and fund parks and sidewalks can boost
exercise rates.</TE>
<TE>   On another front, smell researcher Alan Hirsch says the solution
to America's food fixation might lie in vials of banana oil or
packets of pizza-flavored powder.</TE>
<TE>   At the Smell &amp; Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago,
neurologist Hirsch is following up on a study in which 3,000 people
who sniffed banana, green apple or peppermint aromas whenever they
felt hungry lost an average of 30 pounds over six months.</TE>
<TE>   In his new experiment, flavored powders will be sprinkled on food
to see if they make people think the meal is more filling. Smell and
hunger are closely linked, Hirsch says, and since people who lose
their sense of smell gain 10 to 20 pounds, it stands to reason that
intensifying food flavors might cause them to eat less.</TE>
<TE>   The flavors that will be used in the study include cocoa, onion,
pizza, potato chip, raspberry and spearmint.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, there are no plans for a powder flavored like
ice-cream-filled, syrup-drenched loaves of bread.</TE>

<LD>A Colonial Field Trip</LD>
<LD>   If you were a child in 18th century America, where would you most
likely grow up?</LD>
<LD>   On a farm, of course! Most people in the Colonial period lived and
worked on farms. In the middle and southern Colonies, farms were
often called plantations. Most 18th century farms were not the large
plantations with grand houses and many slaves that most people think
of. Instead, they were much smaller properties that had one-room
houses and dirt floors. These farmers worked hard to raise their
crops and feed their families. They battled bad weather, pests,
illness, labor shortages and personal injury to get their crops
planted, grown and harvested.</LD>
<TE>   There was always work to do! Farming required hard work from
sunrise to sunset. Every member of the family had to help. If you
were a child who was old enough to walk, you were old enough to do
some kind of work. Even with the entire family working long, hard
hours, there were never enough hands to get all the work done.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers of the 18th century had a hard life filled with
responsibilities to their families, neighbors and communities. There
were many successful Colonial farmers who left their children an
inheritance and bright future. There were also many farmers who never
managed to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Viewers can learn more about Colonial farming from "Mr. Alderson's
Farm" this Thursday at 10 a.m., live and interactive, on KLCS-TV. For
more information, visit the Colonial Williamsburg Web site at
www.history.orgtrips or call (800) 761-8331.</TE>

<HD>After Death, a Literary Rebirth</HD>
<DH>Sandor Marai's works are discovered posthumously by his
family and the English--speaking world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>By the time Sandor Marai touched the barrel of the gun to the roof of
his mouth, he had already plotted how the next few minutes would
unfold.</LD>
<LD>   It was a warm and clear-skied Tuesday in February. The cleaning
woman had the day off, so would not be wandering in. Marai's closest
living relatives--his daughter-in-law and three teenage
granddaughters--visited only on weekends, so they too would be spared
the shock of finding their beloved "Poppa" in a blood-splattered
room.</LD>
<LD>   Marai, a writer known in a different time and place for the
precision of his language, would be as fastidious in death as he was
in life. The note to his family was finished; his last will and
testament signed and witnessed. Everything was prepared.</LD>
<TE>   A few minutes after 1 p.m. on Feb. 21, 1989, Marai picked up the
telephone and called the police, telling them where to find his
apartment overlooking San Diego's Balboa Park, and that he was about
to kill himself.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until after Marai's death, after the first waves of
tears and questions and soul-shredding grief had ebbed, that Marai's
American family began to realize the full scope of their Poppa's
life.</TE>
<TE>   They knew he was a writer but they hadn't studied Hungarian
literature so did not know that he was there in the textbooks as the
voice of Hungary's prewar middle class, the John Updike of his
generation. As they cleaned out his apartment, they discovered scores
of books stored in trunks, the name Sandor Marai beneath the
Hungarian titles. There were unpublished diaries, too, an exile's
take on a life disrupted.</TE>
<TE>   The funeral brought its own surprises. Marai's aging friends
showed up as expected but so too did journalists--and Radio Free
Europe, which broadcast the eulogies to Hungary.</TE>
<TE>   Thus it was that Marai's death opened doors to a life his
granddaughters knew nothing about. Not only was he the quiet loving
man who was a human bridge to their Hungarian roots, their family
history was also a literary history.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, few Americans understood Sandor Marai's standing
as a Hungarian man of letters. But a fresh translation of one of his
novels--"Embers" (Knopf, $21) the first to appear in English--has
lifted a veil on the past, for both readers and Marai's
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Marai, 25, likes to type her grandfather's name on her
computer and see where Internet search engines take her. There are
articles and best-seller lists in German, French and Italian,
languages she cannot read. There's a cultural foundation in Hungary
that bears the Marai name, and a Hungarian postage stamp bearing his
portrait in honor of the centenary of his birth in 1900.</TE>
<TE>   And now there are the glowing reviews of "Embers." The book, which
evokes central Europe before World War I, has received critical
acclaim, elevating Marai to literary heights that he likely couldn't
have envisioned.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been really neat if he could have seen all this,"
said granddaughter Lisa Marai, 32, of San Marcos. "He would have been
surprised."</TE>
<TE>   But not as surprised as his descendants have been.</TE>
<TE>   "Amazon.com is where real writers have books, not your
grandfather," Sarah said over coffee at a Carlsbad Starbucks, a
convenient meeting place for the family to discuss a past suddenly of
interest to strangers. "We really loved him and are very, very proud
of him. I love my last name and I love seeing it, and his name, on
books."</TE>
<TE>   The past crops up in unusual places, too. Sarah works in
promotions for the San Diego Zoological Society. More than a year
ago, a woman who works in the accounting office asked Sarah whether
she was related to Sandor Marai, the writer. "She said, 'I'm from
Hungary and I've read all his works,'" Sarah recalled, marveling at
the connection, despite distance and time.</TE>
<TE>   "He was in a completely different country," Sarah, said, "and we
don't speak Hungarian, so we didn't realize how important he was, and
how respected he was."</TE>
<TE>   A Forgotten Figure</TE>
<TE>   To be rediscovered, one must first be lost. But Marai wasn't lost
so much as forgotten and overlooked in a literary world dominated by
English.</TE>
<TE>   Born to a middle-class family in Kassa, now Kosice in Slovakia,
Marai began writing for local newspapers when he was 14 and was an
editor at 18. By then he was also publishing poetry, and went on to
write novels, plays, essays and journals, according to unofficial
biographies and a citation in "The Oxford History of Hungarian
Literature" by Lorant Czigany (Oxford, 1984).</TE>
<TE>   By the time war swept through Europe in the late '30s, Marai was
considered one of Hungary's best writers of works that captured life
among the small nation's bourgeoisie. Critics have compared his work
to such 20th century European masters as Joseph Roth, Robert Musil
and Thomas Mann.</TE>
<TE>   "Embers," originally published in 1942, is one of Marai's lesser
works in the eyes of Hungarian readers. The story uses a dinner
reunion between two boyhood friends to explore fidelity and
abandonment, honor and guilt. The dinner is hosted by a
general-aristocrat; the guest is a lower-born aesthete better suited
to a life of music than the soldiering under which the men's
friendship grew.</TE>
<TE>   But it is also the story of a time past, and the smothering nature
of memory when it is clung to and nurtured to the point of obsession.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the Hungarian middle class whose way of life I was born
into, observed, came to know and scrutinized in all its features to
the very roots, and now I see the whole disintegrating," Marai once
wrote of his work. "Perhaps this is my life's, my writing's sole
duty: to delineate the course of this disintegration."</TE>
<TE>   Czigany, now of London, said the relevance of Marai's work lies in
his explorations of human motives and emotions, timeless themes that
resonate beyond period and place.</TE>
<TE>   "He is considered one of the greatest Hungarian novelists of the
20th century," said Czigany, who has written extensively on Hungarian
literature. "He has a revival in Germany and Italy, translations
coming out in quick succession. His name is often mentioned in
Hungarian TV and radio programs. He has a very well-felt presence on
the literary scene."</TE>
<TE>   Yet none of that happened until after Marai's death.</TE>
<TE>   Because he was a staunch anti-communist, his works ceased to be
published in Hungary after the Communists secured their hold in 1948,
Czigany said. But after the collapse of communism, his works from
prewar years were published in rapid succession, including novels
written during his emigre years.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those works were published by Vorosvary Publishing,
outside of Toronto, in Hungarian for an expatriate audience. Some
were translated into German and French but none were published in
English in Marai's lifetime, adding to the anonymity of his final
years in a neighborhood of apartment buildings, offices and churches
northeast of downtown San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "Somehow he just got missed, and he went through the cracks," said
Carol Brown Janeway, an editor at Knopf who is overseeing translation
of his works into English. Janeway said she first heard of Marai from
a friend in Italian publishing who gave her three new French
translations of Marai novels, including "Embers."</TE>
<TE>   "I started to read about 9 o'clock at night and read till 3:30 in
the morning, reading it cover to cover," Janeway said. "It's a very
unconventional novel ....I was just blown away by it. Then I read the
other two novels and liked them enormously, so I ultimately bought
the rights to publish them in English, and translated the first one
myself."</TE>
<TE>   Janeway doesn't speak Hungarian so she translated "Embers" from
German, which drew sharp criticism from Hungarian translators who
said her decision leaves readers too far from Marai's original words.
Janeway defended the translation on grounds of expediency. "There is
only a handful of fine literary translators from Hungarian," Janeway
said. "It's almost a lost language, in terms of English. Good people
are booked up years ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the details of Marai's life are lost to his surviving
descendants--Harriet McMullen, the widow, since remarried, of Marai's
adopted son; and their three daughters. For instance, the family
knows nothing about Marai's parents, whether he was the son of
shopkeepers or clerks, lawyers or bankers. The past is probably
captured for them in Hungarian-language books, written by Marai and
about Marai. But they do not understand Hungarian.</TE>
<TE>   "We never had a clue what he was writing," said Harriet, who was
born and raised in Massachusetts. "In some books my name is
mentioned, and I always wonder, what is he writing about me?"</TE>
<TE>   Some hints of Marai's early life are sprinkled through his "Memoir
of Hungary: 1944-48," originally published in Hungarian in 1972 and
translated into English in 1996. He describes the Budapest apartment
he shared with his wife, Ilona, for 20 years as filled with furniture
passed down from the estates of their families. He writes about
pictures of his father and grandfather and other relatives hanging on
the walls in spaces not consumed by the 6,000 books in his personal
library. And he mentions the white-gloved maid who clears the dishes
after 11 Marai relatives have dined together on the night in March
1944 when the Germans took over Hungary.</TE>
<TE>   Marai and Ilona had a son, Christopher, who died shortly after his
birth in 1939 or 1940. After air raids destroyed their Budapest
apartment, the couple fled to a nearby village, where they looked
after a young boy who would become their adopted son--and would
eventually father their three American-born granddaughters.</TE>
<TE>   Marai survived the Nazis and their World War II collaborators, and
even published some works during those years. The Communists who
solidified power in 1948, though, proved to be more difficult.
Writers were expected to publish works of socialist realism,
ennobling both the worker and the revolutionary while denouncing the
bourgeois values that framed Marai's life and his art.</TE>
<TE>   Fear of Persecution</TE>
<TE>   Marai sought to remain silent, "to write for the drawer." But the
Communists, he wrote, "would not let me be silent freely." Fearing
persecution--and possibly death--Marai decided to leave rather than
write as bidden. It was a difficult choice: "I had to pay the price
for denying them the opportunity to corrupt me," Marai wrote.</TE>
<TE>   After stints in Italy and Switzerland, Marai and his wife and son
moved in 1952 to New York, where Marai spent 15 years--the early part
of the Cold War--working for Radio Free Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The son, John, became a salesman. He married Harriet in 1968, the
year after his parents left New York for Italy. In 1980, Marai and
Ilona moved to San Diego, where John and his family had settled.</TE>
<TE>   Marai and Ilona were devoted to each other, sharing passions for
books and cigarettes, Hungarian memories and their adult son. The
father and son were especially close, Harriet said, and spent hours
talking in Hungarian about art, politics and history.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Marai moved to San Diego, he was done producing work
for publication. Most of his writings in exile were memoirs and
diaries, but by 1980 he was even finished with those. So at a time
when he moved closer to the lives of his American family, he stepped
away from the Hungarian-rooted work that had sustained him.</TE>
<TE>   His granddaughters found happiness with the proximity of the aging
and generous couple.</TE>
<TE>   "He gave me his encyclopedias," recalled Jennifer. "For my 13th
birthday he gave me an envelope with $400 in it. [My parents] made me
give all but $20 back."</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, Marai's life began crumbling. His wife developed throat
cancer and died. Marai, John and Harriet boarded a small boat in La
Jolla and motored three miles out to sea to scatter her ashes.</TE>
<TE>   Ilona's passing seemed to open death's floodgates. Within months,
Marai's sister and two brothers also died, and the next year his son,
at age 46, succumbed to pancreatic cancer just days after being
diagnosed, sending a whirlwind of emotions through the family--and
Marai. "He sat in there with Dad and kept saying, 'Take me, take
me,'" said granddaughter Jennifer. "After Dad died, his whole
demeanor declined. It contributed to his bad health."</TE>
<TE>   Marai and his daughter-in-law again drove to La Jolla, where they
scattered John's ashes at sea. Such rituals are meant to help heal
the living, but Marai's wounds went deep. Rather than finding solace,
he found loneliness that he once described as being the last guest at
a party as the gracious and patient host sneaks a glance at his
watch.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Marai--who had written a friend that he was
losing patience with life--killed himself. His granddaughters were
allowed to attend the funeral but were left behind when their mother
made the now-familiar trip to the La Jolla docks, where she once
again boarded the small, open boat.</TE>
<TE>   She and the pilot motored out to sea, alone but for a little box
from the funeral home. "We both said a few words and he read
something from the Bible and we had a moment of silence," she said.</TE>
<TE>   And then they scattered the extinguished embers of Sandor Marai's
life to the wind and the waves.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   They walked over to the fireplace and in the cold glow cast by the
wall lights they subjected each other, in the blink of an eye, to a
sharp and expert appraisal.</TE>
<TE>   Konrad was a few months older than the General; he had turned
seventy-five that spring. The two old men looked at each other with
the knowledge that only the aged can bring to the vagaries of the
body: with an absolute attention to physical evidence, seeking the
remaining signs of vital energy, the faint traces of joie de vivre
still illuminating their faces and energizing their bearing.</TE>
<TE>   "No," said Konrad seriously. "Neither of us is getting any
younger."</TE>
<TE>   Yet both of them experienced the same flash of envious but joyful
surprise as they recognized that the other had passed the hard test:
The forty-one years that had elapsed, the time of their separation in
which they had not seen each other and yet had known of each other at
every hour, had not broken them. We endured, thought the General. And
his guest felt a strange sensation of peace, mingled with both
disappointment and pleasure--disappointment, because the other man
was standing there alert and healthy, pleasure because he himself had
managed to return here in full possession of his powers--as he
thought, "He's been waiting for me, and that's what's kept him
strong."</TE>
<TE>   [The General] leans back and lets his arms drop wearily.</TE>
<TE>   "Now there is no further point in asking anything.... One would
need to know why all this happened. And where the boundary lies
between two people. The boundary of betrayal. That is what one would
need to know. And also, where in all this my guilt lies? ... "</TE>
<TE>   He asks this very quietly, and his voice is uncertain. It is
evident from his words that this is the first time he has uttered
them aloud, after he has carried them in his soul for forty-one years
and until now has found no answer.</TE>

<HD>In Paris, Culture Is in the House</HD>
<DH>The Salon du Meuble is a furnishings market with the
panache of a museum exhibition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTIN HOHENADEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>You might have thought, watching the quiet couples strolling past the
antique and futuristic furniture Saturday at the Paris Expo at the
Porte de Versailles, that the Salon du Meuble--the annual furnishings
show--was a museum exhibition, and not one of the world's largest
furniture shows.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a market, but it is also a cultural event," said spokeswoman
Christine Milhoud, adding that it is forbidden for money to change
hands at the market. The thrust of this 20th annual show, which ran
Thursday through Monday, was the France of yesterday and tomorrow,
but about half the 1,500 exhibitors were from outside France,
presenting a range of mass-market, low-end furniture and accessories
to high-end, cutting-edge design.</LD>
<LD>   The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 initially prompted some
cancellations from international exhibitors, Milhoud said, but in the
end didn't seem to have much impact on attendance. "We were very
worried, but in fact I think we were more worried than was
necessary," she said. As in past years, there were no Americans
offering their wares. Director Patrick Renaud, who has headed the
Salon for nine years, said that because of the dollar's strength, it
doesn't make economic sense for Europeans to import American goods.
On the other hand, some 600 of the 55,000 professional buyers here
were from the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   "American buyers [here] are usually interested in classic looks
that correspond with the image the world has of France, not in
contemporary furniture," he said, although he pointed out that this
is less true of buyers from the Western U.S. than Easterners.</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of classic French furniture was on hand as well, and
organizers responded to the craze for all things Deco with the
exhibition "The French Line: The Art of Living in the Normandy Days,"
inspired by the 1930s luxury liner that sailed from Le Havre to New
York. Along with reproductions and new versions of the period's
furniture, lighting, textile and floor coverings, it featured a
display of original pieces from the '30s and '40s--from old Louis
Vuitton steamer trunks to Lalique glassware to the ubiquitous club
chairs that have become so popular in the last several years, on loan
from various French galleries, museums and designer shops.</TE>
<TE>   The Salon was also notable for its attention to contemporary
design. Organizers insist that this year's showing proves that young
French designers are now catching up with their Italian neighbors,
once the undisputed leaders of the avant-garde, thanks to France's
strong design schools, technological advances made accessible via the
Internet and a new openness and interest in cutting-edge design.
Indeed, press reports on the show pointed to a renewed vitality in
French contemporary design, and projects like the new Christian
Liagre-designed Market restaurant seem to support the claims.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Berthes, a 29-year-old French product designer, said he used
his knowledge of rubber and plastic to reimagine furniture, including
prototypes for a series of distinctively shaped, bright red aluminum
and rubber indoor-outdoor lounges. Christian de Riviere, who has been
in charge of the avant-garde segment of the show for the last few
years, said that this year "there is more rigor in terms of line, a
return to well-finished pieces using more technological materials,
more color and transparency and translucency. Things are designed to
be a bit sculptural now, playful but practical." He pointed to a felt
lampshade, a boomerang-shaped fish tank, a fuchsia "butterfly chair"
made of Dacryl by the French designer Christian Ghion or a
"meditation pod" shaped like a lucky clover by the Dutch designer
Steven Blaess .</TE>
<TE>   And while the French tend to change residences far less frequently
than Americans, modular or lightweight furniture that can be
transported easily was a big trend. "We do move house much less often
than Americans," De Riviere said, "but now we can change house
without leaving the same apartment." And transparent materials can
help make the small spaces that Europeans generally live in seem
larger. New designers are now treating furniture like fashion, not as
permanent pieces to be passed on to heirs.</TE>
<TE>   Fusion is still a fresh concept in a country with such loyal
historical traditions, where young designers and consumers have begun
to look everywhere for ideas. An exhibition called "Toward New Styles
of Living--Worldwide" featured a selective group of 12 ambitious
designers from five continents, including colored garden-hose-covered
"anemone" chairs from Brazilian brothers Humberto and Fernando
Campana and Turkish, New York-based designer Ayse Birsel's reimagined
bidet and work pods.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the text accompanying the show's catalog examined the
effects of globalization on the living room or the bedroom. But De
Riviere pointed out that world style does not have to mean the
homogenization of taste. The "Cool" black Styrofoam-stuffed
transparent pillows of Japanese designer Masayo Ave might be
scattered on the floor in a Minimalist apartment in Tokyo, but set
atop an antique divan in Paris, they create a completely different
effect. "It's design that travels, and we reinterpret it according to
our culture," De Riviere said. "It's nomad furniture."</TE>

<LD>To some, this month's introduction of Maya Angelou's inspirational
gift line and greeting cards from Hallmark might be cause for groans.</LD>
<LD>   The giant greeting-card company based in Kansas City, Mo., has
commissioned Angelou--poet, newspaper editor, inspirational speaker,
civil-rights activist, former prostitute and Pulitzer Prize
winner--for a line of 60 specialty gifts and greeting cards that
range in cost from $2.49 to $49.99.</LD>
<LD>   "The main thing in one's own private world is to try to laugh as
much as you cry," one card says on its cover. Inside: "Be strong, as
I know you can be. Be weak when you need to be. I am here if you need
me."</LD>
<TE>   Is it really necessary to groan? Has Maya sold out? Would Gandhi
have marketed meditation pillows? Or is it more like F. Scott
Fitzgerald writing movie scripts?</TE>
<TE>   Angelou's Life Mosaic collection of cards and
items--treasure-keepers, photo frames, displayable quotes, pillows
and bookmarks--"offers a universal voice of hope and inspiration for
women, uniting them as they face common life experiences, challenges
and milestones," says www.hallmark.com.</TE>
<TE>   When Sting's 1999 "Desert Rose" turned "Brand New Day" into his
largest release after his manager persuaded Jaguar to use a music
video in its ads, he defended the move. He said it was a way to get
his music to more people.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, we are taking it upon ourselves to introduce
our own line of greeting cards and inspirational gifts, from some of
our favorite American poets:</TE>
<TE>   Razors pain you;</TE>
<TE>   Rivers are damp;</TE>
<TE>   Acids stain you;</TE>
<TE>   And drugs cause cramp.</TE>
<TE>   Guns aren't lawful;</TE>
<TE>   Nooses give;</TE>
<TE>   Gas smells awful;</TE>
<TE>   You might as well live.</TE>
<TE>   --Dorothy Parker, American satirist, critic, short-story writer,
1893-1967</TE>
<TE>   Proposed use: greeting card or desk calendar.</TE>
<TE>   I, too, sing America.</TE>
<TE>   I am the darker brother.</TE>
<TE>   They send me to eat in the</TE>
<TE>   kitchen</TE>
<TE>   When company comes,</TE>
<TE>   But I laugh,</TE>
<TE>   And eat well</TE>
<TE>   And grow strong.</TE>
<TE>   Tomorrow</TE>
<TE>   I'll be at the table</TE>
<TE>   When company comes.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody'll dare</TE>
<TE>   Say to me,</TE>
<TE>   "Eat in the kitchen"</TE>
<TE>   Then.</TE>
<TE>   Besides,</TE>
<TE>   They'll see how beautiful I am</TE>
<TE>   And be ashamed --</TE>
<TE>   I, too, am America.</TE>
<TE>   --Langston Hughes, American poet, 1902-1967</TE>
<TE>   Proposed use: greeting card or wall calendar.</TE>
<TE>   I cannot live with You</TE>
<TE>   It would be Life</TE>
<TE>   And Life is over there</TE>
<TE>   Behind the Shelf</TE>
<TE>   --Emily Dickinson, American poet, 1830-1886</TE>
<TE>   Proposed use: Valentine's Day card.</TE>
<TE>   For the listener, who listens in the snow,</TE>
<TE>   And, nothing himself, beholds</TE>
<TE>   Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is</TE>
<TE>   --Wallace Stevens, American writer and Hartford insurance
executive, 1879-1955</TE>
<TE>   Proposed use: bookends.</TE>
<TE>   I know the bottom, she says. I know it with my great tap root:</TE>
<TE>   It is what you fear.</TE>
<TE>   I do not fear it: I have been there.</TE>
<TE>   --Sylvia Plath, American poet, 1932-1963</TE>
<TE>   Proposed use: lavender sachet.</TE>
<TE>   Lie on your back on stone</TE>
<TE>   the stone carved to fit</TE>
<TE>   the shape of yourself.</TE>
<TE>   Who made it like this,</TE>
<TE>   knowing that I would be along</TE>
<TE>   in a million years and look</TE>
<TE>   at the sky being blue forever?</TE>
<TE>   --Simon Ortiz, American poet, 1941-</TE>
<TE>   Proposed use: framed prints.</TE>
<TE>   Those that don't got it, can't show it. Those that got it, can't
hide it.</TE>
<TE>   --Zora Neale Hurston, American author and anthropologist,
1891-1960</TE>
<TE>   Proposed use: decorative pillow.</TE>

<HD>How 'Bout Rooting for Those Potato Heads?</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The name of Washington's pro football team is a badge of honor for
some, a slur to others, and never the twain shall meet.</LD>
<LD>   Most recently, a Manhattan Beach man who played for the Redskins
in the 1950s was told by the  California Department of Motor Vehicles
to turn in his "1REDSKN" license plate, which was deemed offensive
after a Native American activist complained.</LD>
<LD>   Here's how to resolve this once and for all: Let the team keep the
name, but change its mascot. Replace the American Indian face with a
red-skinned potato.</LD>
<TE>   At long last, a win-win solution for an 8-8 football team and
mascot protesters who've yet to score against a pro sports franchise!</TE>
<TE>   No people would be objectified in the making of the logos; the
Washington Redskins would still be the Washington Redskins;
newspapers that refuse to print the team name could lift their bans;
and the DMV could rethink its license-plate policy.</TE>
<TE>   The team seems to find the suggestion offensive. "We're proud of
our team logo. It stands for tradition and excellence, and we don't
joke around about it," said Michelle Tessier, spokeswoman for the
Washington Redskins. Tessier said little more, but her tone suggested
the team might change its mascot around the time Congress outlaws
campaign contributions from lobbyists.</TE>
<TE>   But others are intrigued. "We'd be all for it," said Wendy Jenkins
of the Denver-based National Potato Promotion Board. With the potato
on its uniforms, "the team might get more support from the rest of
the nation," Jenkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, who would protest potatoes? Green Bay Packers fans have
been "cheese heads" for years without so much as a whimper from the
lactose intolerant. Why not the "potato heads"?</TE>
<TE>   Besides, pro football is already associated with potatoes, much
like baseball is with the hot dog. It is, after all, couch potatoes
who settle in front of their TVs for the big game, bag of chips in
hand.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, there could be a downside for the team. Imagine the
headlines after losses proclaiming the Redskins "whipped," "mashed"
or "creamed."</TE>
<TE>   American Indian comic Charlie Hill thinks the 'Skins should at
least consider the spud. The potato, he points out, is a food that
has nourished the world, something worthy of celebration and honor.</TE>
<TE>   But he doubts the team will listen.</TE>
<TE>   "Sports teams with big money always want to tell us what's
offensive, instead of us telling them," said Hill, who has protested
Indian mascots for years.</TE>
<TE>   Hill thinks maybe the Redskins, like a lot of folks today, are too
sensitive. In the early 1970s, he and some Native American buddies at
the University of Wisconsin called their intramural basketball and
volleyball teams the Fighting Norwegians.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody was offended, he said. Those were the good old days.</TE>

<LD>One parent investigated the judges' credentials, hoping to find some
hint of incompetence or impropriety that might invalidate the
competition. Another tried to beat back that challenge by citing the
signed pledge their children made to abide by the judges' decision.</LD>
<LD>   The contest was not for a spot on the Olympic team, but on the
Newport Harbor High cheerleading squad. And the dispute has pitted
families against one another, ripped apart long-standing social
circles and landed the Newport Beach campus in an unflattering
national spotlight.</LD>
<LD>   School officials are trying to appease parents with a compromise,
one that would add a few more spots to the squad and let the girls
who lost try out one more time. And while that might make some people
feel better, it would do little to burnish the image of a
cheerleading squad now cited as the latest example of how kids'
activities can be mucked up by overzealous parents.</LD>
<TE>   Cheerleading and controversy seem to go together like pompoms.
Part of it is the subjective nature of the endeavor. How do you
measure perkiness and a pretty smile against a flawless cartwheel and
cool dance moves? And part is the cachet that generations of
cheerleaders have enjoyed. Even my 10-year-old knows, thanks to an
endless stream of pep squad movie heroines, that cheerleaders are
always the popular girls.</TE>
<TE>   And Newport Harbor is no stranger to cheerleader-related legal
squabbles. Seven years ago, a would-be cheerleader sued the school,
claiming the judges had conspired to keep her off the squad. The
school district settled out of court for an amount rumored to be
around $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   That led the school to adopt a judging process more suited to a
Miss America pageant than the selection of a pep squad. A team of
"professional" cheerleading judges--college cheerleaders, dance and
gymnastics instructors, and pep squad coaches from other schools--is
paid to score the girls on their splits, stunts and dance routines.
Their scores are tabulated by a certified public accountant, with a
representative from the League of Women Voters keeping watch.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the school's cheerleading coach complained about the
judging process, and that led Newport Harbor Principal Mike Vossen to
scrap the results and expand the squad from 30 to 48, to allow every
girl who tried out to have a spot. That brought protests from parents
whose daughters made the initial cut. And that brought in district
administrators, who ruled last week that the judges' choices would
stand, but four spots would be added to the squad, with tryouts for
those to be held soon.</TE>
<TE>   That compromise seems to have pleased no one. Some from the
current crop of cheerleaders complain that the squad was already too
large. And many who didn't make the team but were added by the
principal, then removed last week, say they are too traumatized to
try out again.</TE>
<TE>   But emotional trauma is part of the terrain in high school, some
parents argue. "It's a horrendous life lesson, but kids have to learn
that rules are rules," said Mike Johnston, whose two daughters have
spent years as cheerleaders. Before the girls tried out, they agreed
to abide by the rules spelled out in a handbook. "And it says in five
different places--explicitly, in bold print--that no one can question
the judging of the judges," he said. "The rules are absolute, cast in
stone. It's really a very simple matter."</TE>
<TE>   This year, Johnston's younger daughter made the squad. Would it
seem so simple to him if she hadn't; if she'd been one of those left
sobbing in the bleachers? He says it would. As a matter of fact, last
year she tried out, but failed to make the varsity team. "She was
disappointed, but she didn't run off crying," he said. He offered her
flying lessons instead.</TE>
<TE>   But not every would-be cheerleader wants her interests redirected.
Newport Harbor cheerleading coach Lisa Callahan says even now--more
than six weeks after the original tryouts--she's still talking to
distraught mothers who are wondering how to console their
disappointed daughters.</TE>
<TE>   And I understand how those daughters feel. I still remember, as a
12-year-old, trying to hold back tears as I scanned the list of new
cheerleaders, and realized I hadn't made the seventh-grade squad. And
I know how those mothers feel. When the phone call came last year
announcing that my sixth-grader was now a cheerleader, it was hard to
tell which one of us was happier.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan, a professional cheerleader and former Raiderette, says
that since the controversy broke, she's getting calls at home and is
stopped by women on the street who have "this really strong emotional
reaction. I had a woman who must have been 50 years old tell me she
cried when she read [about the controversy], that it brought back
memories" of when she was cut from the high school squad.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an experience--whether you make it or you don't--that stays
with you your whole life."</TE>
<TE>   Kim Stephens would consider herself an avid cheerleading mom. When
her older daughter made the squad, she helped start its booster club.
Last year, she watched her younger daughter put in 20 to 30 hours a
week on the junior varsity squad. "And they're not doing it to get a
football [player] boyfriend or to be popular," she said.</TE>
<TE>   This year, her daughter did not make the varsity squad--and
Stephens has been one of the parents leading the charge to have the
judging reconsidered. "It's cruel what they've done to them," she
said of the back-and-forth. "It's hard to see your little girl go
through this when this is all she's ever wanted."</TE>
<TE>   "It takes over your life," said Courtney Blahmer, a senior who has
been a Newport Harbor cheerleader for four years and based her
college choice, in part, on which school has the best cheerleading
squad. "When it gets taken away from you, it's really scary. That's
why not making the team is such a big deal."</TE>
<TE>   Callahan said the popularity of dancing and dancers has raised the
profile of cheerleading and made it more about performance than
rah-rah-rah. "All those hip-hop videos. 'N Sync, Destiny's Child ...
they're all dancing and moving around. They've got this whole look. A
lot of these girls start taking hip-hop [dance] classes when they're
young, then they watch MTV and think, 'That's so cool. I want to be
like that.' So it's become a big deal...."</TE>
<TE>   But cheerleaders are also easy targets, the butt of jokes.</TE>
<TE>   "People want to poke fun, to portray them as a bunch of spoiled
brats," said Callahan. "That's not the way it is. They're a great
group of girls--smart, committed, full of energy. My  No. 1 thing is
for them to look good out there and feel good about themselves, like
'You're not some bimbo, you're talented, well-respected,
intelligent.'"</TE>
<TE>   Now their parents have another lesson to teach--that hanging up
your pompoms doesn't mean it's the end of the world.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought about suing," said Stephens, "but the money, the
lawyers, the time it would take.... Then I thought 'Why am I beating
myself up over this?'"</TE>
<TE>   And then she said something that  makes sense no matter where you
find yourself in this mess: "I have to consider the fact that it is
just cheerleading."</TE>

<HD>The Key on the Collar</HD>
<DH>Part 2 The story so far: A tired, lost dog with a
mysterious key on his collar is trying to find his way back home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH VAN STEENWYK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dog walked down the road at first light. The road climbed a steep
hill and entered a forest. The dog knew he had to go down the other
side of the hill.</LD>
<LD>   He climbed steadily until he reached a small cabin. The door was
partly open, and he looked inside.</LD>
<LD>   "Good morning. You're just in time for breakfast."</LD>
<TE>   A heavy-set man with a long beard opened the door all the way, and
the dog entered.</TE>
<TE>   He sat down beside the table and waited.</TE>
<TE>   The old man went to the stove, spooned oatmeal into two bowls and
put one on the table and one on the floor. "Go on," he said. "It's
good for you."</TE>
<TE>   The dog hadn't eaten this stuff before, but he was hungry. The man
ate, too, then sat back to sip his coffee.</TE>
<TE>   "Say, what is that thing on your collar?" he asked. "Is that your
dog tag?"</TE>
<TE>   He leaned down to look. "Looks like a key I used to have, but I
lost it," he said. He thought a minute, then got up and reached high
onto a shelf. "Been meaning to break this strongbox open," he went
on. "Maybe your key will open it instead."</TE>
<TE>   The old man removed the dog's collar and tried the key on his box.</TE>
<TE>   He tried again and again, but the lock wouldn't open. Finally, he
put the dog's collar back on him.</TE>
<TE>   "That key must be mighty important," the old man said, sitting
down once again, "since someone trusted it to you."</TE>
<TE>   The dog walked to the screen door. He wagged his tail and waited.</TE>
<TE>   "I see," the old man said. "You've got somewhere to go, and
someone is waiting for that key." He reached down and gave the dog a
pat. "Thanks for coming by and keeping me company a little while."</TE>
<TE>   He opened the screen door, and the dog walked down the path,
deeper into the woods. The forest was very quiet except for the
clink, clink, clink of the key on the dog's collar.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: Where is the dog going, and who is waiting for the key?</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Van Steenwyk's dogs have provided her with many ideas
for stories. This story will be on The Times' Web site at
www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<HD>Davis Plans 'Tooth and Nail' Fight Over Oil Drilling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Davis administration ratcheted up the rhetoric Monday in an
ongoing fight with the Bush administration over the federal
government's push for new oil drilling off the California coast.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the Bush administration formalized its appeal of a
federal court ruling requiring state officials to review any new oil
exploration plans--a decision that effectively halted new oil
drilling off the California coast.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis is in "sharp disagreement" with the Bush
administration on the matter and has no plans to back down, spokesman
Steve Maviglio said Monday. "The governor plans to fight this tooth
and nail all the way up to the Supreme Court if need be," he said.</LD>
<TE>   At issue are 36 tracts in federal waters between Ventura and San
Luis Obispo counties that were leased to oil companies from 1968 to
1984. The leases are not covered by state and federal moratoriums
that prohibit new drilling.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Nichols, the state's resources secretary, said although it is
up to the California Coastal Commission to decide the leases' fate,
she couldn't conceive of a scenario in which drilling would be
allowed.</TE>
<TE>   She also brushed aside as unacceptable a settlement offer
presented by her federal counterparts, saying that the state would
have been forced to relinquish its right to make sure new drilling
plans conform to state environmental protections.</TE>
<TE>   Nichols said the best oil was removed from these offshore areas
years ago. What's left, she said, is so heavy and viscous that it
resembles asphalt. Any spill would be devastating to birds and marine
mammals, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "This stuff is deadly to marine life," Nichols said. "We're not
talking about trivial damage in the event of a spill."</TE>

<HD>Eagles Back at Winter Home</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Despite the Klamath Basin water war, migration
appears normal. But some worry about future prospects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TULELAKE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>With the first wisps of winter, they soar in, the largest
concentration of bald eagles in the lower 48 states. In a good year,
as many as 900 of the majestic birds show up in the wildlife refuges
ringing this farm community.</LD>
<LD>   So far this year, the migration appears to be relatively normal.</LD>
<LD>   But with the eagles' once hospitable winter home now the epicenter
of a water war so fierce it has drawn national attention,
conservationists worry that the birds' future in the broad, stark
plain of the Klamath Basin remains in doubt.</LD>
<TE>   Their prospects looked particularly dismal last year as drought
dried up wetlands that serve as the birds' winter habitat. A late
spurt of irrigation water and heavy snows helped turn things around.</TE>
<TE>   Eagles have historically wintered in the basin, which straddles
the California-Oregon border. It is a key stop on the Pacific Flyway
for migrating waterfowl. Biologists estimate that 80% of the ducks,
geese and other birds that commute up and down the flyway stop over
in the Klamath. Waterfowl are a staple of the eagles' diet.</TE>
<TE>   "The long-term impacts are what spook you the most," said Dave
Mauser, a federal biologist. "Without water, you lower the carrying
capacity of the flyway for waterfowl and hence for eagles."</TE>
<TE>   In the decades since the Klamath River was tamed by dikes and
canals to feed the thirst of agribusiness, the basin's waterfowl
population has been in steady decline. As recently as the early
1960s, 6 million ducks, geese and other migrating birds stopped in
the basin. Now, a typical year might see a quarter of that number.</TE>
<TE>   In the year just ended, one of the worst droughts in a century cut
available water to about a third of average. And federal land
managers slashed irrigation supplies to support endangered salmon in
the Klamath River and suckerfish in Upper Klamath Lake. Those
cutbacks sparked weeks of protests by Klamath Basin farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Amid that fight, the region's six wildlife refuges also fared
dismally. From January to August 2001, no water was allowed to flow
to the wetlands. "By the middle of summer, we were in bad shape,"
said Phil Norton, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service refuge manager in
Klamath.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities worried that without water, the usual migration of
waterfowl would be stemmed and the bald eagles--for decades
themselves on the federal endangered species list--could be harmed.</TE>
<TE>   The water flow was restored only after environmentalists filed
suit in August warning that the fall migration and the fate of the
eagles hung in the balance. The "eagle water," as it was called,
began to flow in late summer.</TE>
<TE>   Norton said the flow helped save the fall migration, but came too
late to bolster the breeding season. With some wetlands bone-dry,
nesting birds were forced to congregate around just a few marshes,
making their eggs and chicks easy pickings for raccoons and other
predators.</TE>
<TE>   Eagles begin to show up in November and December, migrating down
from Canada. The population peaks in early February. By March, the
eagles are heading back north on the spring migration.</TE>
<TE>   With a stunning cap of white feathers set atop a powerful set of
dark-gray wings, the bald eagle's good looks mask a quiet reputation
as an inveterate scavenger. Biologists said eagles have the hunting
skills to catch live prey, but typically prefer to feed on dead or
diseased birds. Salmon exhausted by the long swim to spawn or minced
up by dam turbines also are a popular menu item.</TE>
<TE>   Current worries aside, the 1990s have been a productive decade for
the birds. Once pushed to near extinction by pesticide-induced
reproductive problems and illegal hunting, bald eagles have bounded
back. Federal regulators even talk of some day removing them from the
endangered species list.</TE>
<TE>   Heading into this winter, wildlife biologists suggested that the
Klamath eagles would need at least 125,000 wintering waterfowl to
avoid repercussions.</TE>
<TE>   They got even more. Counts early this month put the waterfowl
population at about 200,000, up dramatically from 140,000 in January
2001 and 155,000 in January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The eagles didn't seem to be faring as well, with just 97 birds
showing up in early January counts of the entire basin. That is far
under the 220 tallied the same time a year earlier and a fraction of
the 552 in 1998, the last really big year for eagles in the basin.</TE>
<TE>   But last week biologists found 183 at a single roost of big trees
near the Lower Klamath Refuge, boosting confidence that the eagles
are faring well.</TE>
<TE>   "It's looking like a reasonably average kind of year, like it's
been the last five years or so," said Jim Hainline, the federal
wildlife biologist who conducts the count.</TE>
<TE>   Conservationists said the more important issue is the birds'
long-term prospects.</TE>
<TE>   With water hard to come by more years than not, the wetlands of
the Klamath Basin have typically stood last in line when federal
managers make allotments. The water needs of endangered fish,
agribusiness and Native American tribes typically carry a higher
priority than the refuges.</TE>
<TE>   "This didn't just become a problem in 2001," said Wendell Wood of
the Oregon Natural Resources Council. "The eagles and other wildlife
have been taking a hit for years."</TE>
<TE>   Wood and other environmentalists would like to see agricultural
water in the basin slashed in half. In particular, they advocate an
end to farming on more than 20,000 acres in the region's two biggest
wildlife refuges. Wood said farming uses water best left for
wildlife, taints the wetlands with pesticides and is "completely
incongruous" with environmental stewardship.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, refuge managers proposed shifting farming off the
protected lands, but the idea was attacked by many of the region's
most prosperous farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Norton, the refuge manager, takes all the criticism in stride.</TE>
<TE>   "Environmentalists accuse me of being in bed with the irrigators,
and irrigators accuse me of being an environmental wacko," he said.</TE>
<TE>   New ideas being offered include adopting low-water irrigation
practices and planting less-thirsty crops. Also on the table is a
long-debated proposal to shift farming in the refuge onto low-quality
wetland in exchange for flooding spent cropland to create better bird
habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a debate continues in Congress over what to do about
the Klamath Basin. Legislation by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that would
pour $175 million into the basin for solutions stalled late last
year, but it is expected to be revived in this session.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Mother Nature is cooperating. A series of winter storms
has left the basin swaddled in snow, giving hope that enough water
will be available this spring to serve the needs of fish, farmers,
waterfowl and eagles.</TE>
<TE>   Norton warned, however, that "we're going to have more dry years
in the future," so long-term solutions must be found.</TE>
<TE>   "We ought to sit down at the table and talk like adults.... Right
now we've got a stalemate. Everyone has to give a little bit."</TE>

<HD>Davis' Budget Plan Rebuked by Riordan</HD>
<DH>Politics: Proposal to use state's share of tobacco funds to
close deficit is similar to one made by the former L.A. mayor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gubernatorial candidate Richard Riordan criticized Gov. Gray Davis on
Monday for proposing a diversion of California's tobacco settlement
money to help close the state's budget gap--a proposal similar to one
Riordan himself made as mayor of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago, Riordan asked the City Council to use the city's
share of the tobacco settlement to resolve lawsuits in the Rampart
police corruption scandal. The council rejected the plan.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, during a campaign stop at the Richard Nixon Library &amp;
Birthplace in Yorba Linda, a college student asked the Republican
candidate what he thought of Davis' tobacco money proposal.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a terrible mistake," Riordan said.</TE>
<TE>   California receives about $500 million a year under the nationwide
settlement of tobacco litigation. On Thursday, Davis proposed
borrowing $2.4 billion against future tobacco payments to help plug a
$12.5-billion budget gap.</TE>
<TE>   To repay the bonds with interest would cost the state $190 million
a year over the next 22 years--essentially lowering the tobacco
settlement payments by 40% each year.</TE>
<TE>   "What he's doing is taking a revenue stream that the state would
have over 25 years, and paying it to take care of the mistakes that
all happened in the year 2001," Riordan said. "I think that this is
just not the way to run finances."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about his similar proposal, Riordan responded:</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, if you want to use the money for something, use it for
something positive that people can criticize you on or not criticize
you on--like Rampart. But don't use it to cover a deficit."</TE>
<TE>   Roger Salazar, a spokesman for the Democratic governor's
reelection campaign, called Riordan's remarks "ludicrous." He said
Riordan's proposal for the Los Angeles tobacco money would have
offered the public no tangible benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "That money would not have made one person safer," Salazar said.
"You weren't going to get any more police on the streets."</TE>
<TE>   Although he was critical of the steps taken by Davis to cover the
budget gap, Riordan said he would not lay out any specific budget
cuts until Davis proposes his final spending plan in May. That would
be two months after the March 5 Republican primary.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as the kind of details as to what programs I'm going to
cut ... I won't do it until after the governor issues his real budget
in May," Riordan said. Riordan's proposal for the use of Los Angeles'
tobacco settlement came in February 2000. In essence, it would have
given the city nearly $100 million to cover the cost of Rampart
lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the city was facing its first wave of liability
payments to people who had been abused by Los Angeles police officers
implicated in improper shootings, framing of suspects, thefts,
beatings, perjury and cover-ups.</TE>
<TE>   City Council members called Riordan's plan fiscally irresponsible
and refused to approve it.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Feuer, a Democrat who was then chairman of the council's
budget committee, said Riordan's remarks Monday were "hypocritical"
and "disingenuous."</TE>
<TE>   "If anybody should know that there are flaws in this approach,
it's Riordan, who--when he proposed essentially the same thing--was
shot down by just about every other elected city official and key
staff members in City Hall," Feuer said.</TE>

<HD>Simon Opts to Air First Ad on Radio</HD>
<DH>Politics: Gubernatorial hopeful's aides back the strategy
as media savvy. Others see it as signaling a lack of resolve.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial hopeful Bill Simon Jr. launched his
advertising campaign Monday with a statewide radio spot that touts
his record in business and philanthropy.</LD>
<LD>   But the modest media buy served only to renew questions about how
seriously Simon plans to compete in the March 5 primary.</LD>
<LD>   The 60-second advertisement calls Simon the "conservative
Republican for governor," an apparent swipe at both former Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, who is running well to the left of
Simon, and Secretary of State Bill Jones, the third major GOP
candidate.</LD>
<TE>   The spot also highlights Simon's ties to former New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, noting that Simon served as an assistant U.S.
attorney under Giuliani during the Reagan administration. (Giuliani
plans to join Simon at a campaign stop Thursday in Los Angeles.)</TE>
<TE>   But the advertisement was less noteworthy for its autobiographical
content than its placement on radio--which has considerably less
reach than television--and the fact that it began airing so late in
the campaign of a candidate who is so little known.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, by far the best-known of the candidates, began
advertising on television in most parts of the state last week.
Jones, who lacks the personal millions that Riordan and Simon can
both draw upon, hopes to begin TV advertising by the end of the
month.</TE>
<TE>   By waiting so long to run ads and starting on such a modest scale,
Simon reinforced doubts in Republican ranks that he was serious about
overtaking Riordan, a friend who moves in many of the same social
circles.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the new guy on the block, and he really needed to be first
on the air," said Arnold Steinberg, a veteran GOP strategist who once
worked for Riordan but is now neutral in the party primary.</TE>
<TE>   "I have successfully used radio before television to warm up the
electorate, but not this late," Steinberg said. "Radio is usually and
properly a reinforcement or secondary medium to television."</TE>
<TE>   However, Sal Russo, chief strategist for the Simon campaign, said
that the radio spots were the most cost-effective way of introducing
the candidate, and that Simon would soon follow up with more visible
TV spots.</TE>
<TE>   "Television is more effective at communicating feelings," Russo
said. "Right now, we're communicating who Bill Simon is."</TE>
<TE>   Although aides once spoke of a $60-million campaign budget, Simon
has struggled to raise money for his first-time run for public
office. He recently loaned his campaign nearly $1.7 million to try to
stay competitive. Other than his own money, he had raised only
$278,000 in the last three months of 2001.</TE>

<HD>Drunk Driving Warnings Heeded, Statistics Indicate</HD>
<DH>DUI: California Highway Patrol arrests are half what they
were in 1990. Laws, education and lower tolerance for the crime are
credited.</DH>

<LD>Drunk driving arrests by the California Highway Patrol continued
their long-term decline last year, pushing levels to half of what
they were in 1990.</LD>
<LD>   CHP officers arrested 79,460 people for driving under the
influence in 2001. The previous year they made 81,383 arrests.</LD>
<LD>   The number has fallen annually since 1990, reflecting an overall
drop in drunk driving resulting from a multi-pronged national
offensive, officials say.</LD>
<TE>   Laws have been toughened. Public education campaigns about the
dangers of drinking and driving have become commonplace. And
society's tolerance of drunk driving has been decreasing.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an entirely different attitude about people consuming
alcohol and how they're going to get home that you didn't see
before," said Tina Pasco, executive director of the Los Angeles
chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving.</TE>
<TE>   Studies have shown that license suspension or revocation, alcohol
treatment and education programs, and impoundment of drivers' cars to
be effective, said Steve Haskins, spokesman for the Department of
Motor Vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Intoxicated drivers who kill also face increasingly stiff
penalties that keep repeat offenders incarcerated longer. A law
enacted in 1997, called Courtney's Law, allows judges to sentence
repeat drunk drivers to 15 years to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "The Legislature has been steadily tightening up the laws," said
CHP Commissioner Spike Helmick. "And I think society as a whole has
finally gotten the message that it's not acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   But Helmick also cited another factor--one he is not happy about.</TE>
<TE>   There are more drivers, and there is more for CHP officers to do,
but agency staffing is essentially the same.</TE>
<TE>   "Our people are stretched," Helmick said. "Fewer people patrolling
means fewer people are arrested."</TE>
<TE>   The number of drivers in California has increased with the state's
population. In 1990, the state had about 30 million people and 19.9
million licensed drivers, according to the CHP. In 1999, the
population was 34 million, with about 21 million licensed drivers.
Over the same period, Californians also drove more, from 259 billion
miles in 1990 to more than 300 billion miles in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, the total number of drunk driving arrests declined from
193,250 in 1997 to 183,955 in 2000, according to the DMV.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, drunk driving arrests declined from 3,744 in 1993
to 2,758 in 2000, the most recent year for which statistics are
available.</TE>
<TE>   "DUI enforcement is one of our highest priorities because drunk
drivers cause a lot of grief," said Sgt. John Pasquariello, a
spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Other cities where such arrests have dropped include Oakland,
where they fell from 658 in 1998 to 552 last year.</TE>
<TE>   In San Jose, however, arrests rose, from 2,427 in 1998 to 3,349
last year. Sgt. Steve Dixon, spokesman for the San Jose Police
Department, said he couldn't explain the increase but believed that
the region's growing population during the high technology boom was a
factor.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the Silicon Valley. We have a lot of drivers up here,"
Dixon said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the problem of drunk driving has hardly disappeared, the
long-term drop in CHP arrests has been dramatic. The agency cited
twice as many people for driving under the influence in 1990 as it
did last year.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics compiled by the state Department of Motor Vehicles
similarly show a plunge in DUI arrests by all law enforcement
agencies from 1990 to 1999, the last year for which the agency has
figures.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, a 1999 U.S. Justice Department study found that the
number of drunk driving arrests fell nearly 20% from 1986 to 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Alcohol-related fatalities are also down significantly nationwide,
falling 25% from 1990 to 2000. However, the 2000 figures were higher
than the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   In California, alcohol-related traffic deaths and injuries
followed the same pattern, declining generally but creeping up in
2000 for the first time in more than a decade. Figures for such
deaths in 2001 will not be available until spring.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, 1,233 people died in alcohol-related traffic accidents
in 2000, 21 fewer than in 1996, but 5% more than in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Though the increase was not especially significant statistically,
it caused concern. "It is a wake-up note to pay attention," said
Carol Thorp of the Automobile Club of Southern California.</TE>

<CX>   Drunk driving--An article in the California section Tuesday about a
decline in drunk driving contained figures that were mischaracterized by
the Los Angeles Police Department. Accidents, not arrests, declined from
3,744 in 1993 to 2,758 in 2000. Arrests also dropped, from 15,671 in 1993
to 11,262 in 2000.</CX>

<HD>Youths' Use of Supplements Decried</HD>
<DH>Health: Experts say 1 million students may have taken
muscle-building and weight-loss products.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>With experts testifying that as many as 1 million high school
students have consumed supplements aimed at helping them lose weight
or perform better on the playing field, state lawmakers vowed Monday
to take steps to prohibit minors from having access to those
substances.</LD>
<LD>   The California Interscholastic Federation, which oversees high
school sports, has no policy on the use of creatine and steroid
precursors such as androstenedione, touted as muscle-building
products. It also does not address herbal ephedrine. The U.S. Food
and Drug Administration has received reports of 80 people who have
died since the mid-1990s after using products that contained ephedra.
Ephedrine is used in some weight-loss and energy-boosting dietary
supplements.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a dream team market," state Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa
Monica) said of the youth market for such products. "People [in high
school] want to bulk up, and there are people who want to slim down,
and there's no one else left."</LD>
<TE>   The federal government has limited authority to regulate the
products, known as dietary supplements. Though some manufacturers
have label warnings that their products are not for sale to minors,
Texas is the only state that has banned the sale of herbal ephedrine
to minors.</TE>
<TE>   In California, state Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough), who
presided over Monday's hearing, is pushing legislation, SB 397, to
prohibit sales to minors, but it stalled in the Assembly last year.</TE>
<TE>   "At the very least, we have to prohibit the sale of ephedra [to
minors]," said Speier, who hopes to revive her measure this year.
"Warning labels should be clear and conspicuous. And we've got to
embark on a huge education program."</TE>
<TE>   In testimony Monday, Dr. Christine Haller of the UC San Francisco
medical school cited surveys showing that 1 million people between
the ages of 12 and 17 have used such products, and that 57% of
college athletes who use supplements report starting when they were
in high school.</TE>
<TE>   Haller said student athletes rarely follow dose limits suggested
on the labels, believing that if "some is good, then more must be
better."</TE>
<TE>   The Olympics, NCAA and National Football League prohibit the use
of many such products, including herbal ephedrine, also known as
ephedra and ma huang, and steroid precursors such as androstenedione,
or andro, made famous when baseball slugger Mark McGwire acknowledged
using it in 1998 when he hit 70 home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Davis, a 19-year-old community college student from Pleasant
Hill, testified that when he was a high school quarterback in Contra
Costa County, he suffered seizures twice while taking an array of
supplements. The second seizure occurred as he was driving; he drove
off the road and nearly plunged into a creek.</TE>
<TE>   "I really wanted to take my performance to the next level," Davis
said, explaining why he began taking creatine, andro and herbal
ephedrine products.</TE>
<TE>   He said his coaches and parents never recommended that he take
such supplements. But he said that other high school athletes come up
with the suggestions of the "magic pills," and that the products are
readily available at stores and on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Blake of the California Interscholastic Federation said the
high school sports organization last year produced a fact sheet for
coaches detailing the potential ill effects of herbal ephedrine.
Among those listed were strokes, heart attacks and seizures.</TE>
<TE>   "The performance-enhancement drug epidemic is new--and it is an
epidemic," Blake said.</TE>
<TE>   Blake said high school coaches, who need virtually no formal
training, often tell students that they need to "get bigger,
stronger, faster."</TE>
<TE>   Blake said a program begun in the mid-1990s to train coaches on an
array of issues, including health and safety, faces budget cutbacks.
Gov. Gray Davis has proposed cutting $1 million from the coach
training program as part of his effort to deal with a $12-billion
state budget deficit.</TE>

<HD>Tijuana Drug Trafficker Gets 30 Years in Prison</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A man who became a top figure in one of Mexico's largest and most
violent drug cartels after a relatively comfortable childhood in
suburban San Diego was sentenced Monday to 30 years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   With his ex-wife and three children looking on in federal court,
Everardo Arturo "Kitti" Paez apologized as he became the
highest-ranking member of the Arellano Felix drug cartel to be
convicted and sentenced in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   "I am very sorry for what I did," Paez said, choking with emotion.
"I also want to apologize to the court, and to my family, especially
my mother and children, and to society in general."</LD>
<TE>   Paez, 35, pleaded guilty in October to one count of participating
in a continuing criminal enterprise and a second of conspiracy to
launder drug proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   As part of his plea agreement, he admitted smuggling 3 1/2 tons of
cocaine into the United States from 1989 to 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Paez, who was a legal U.S. resident but held Mexican citizenship,
was arrested while leaving a sushi restaurant he owned in Tijuana,
Mexico, in 1997. He spent the next four years fighting extradition.</TE>
<TE>   He lost his bid when Mexico's Supreme Court ruled in January 2001
that its citizens could be extradited to the United States provided
they did not face the death penalty or life imprisonment. Last
spring, Paez became the first major trafficker sent north for trial
under the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "This lets traffickers in Mexico know that there is no escape from
American justice," Assistant U.S. Atty. Patrick O'Toole said after
the sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials are hopeful Mexico soon will extradite Ismael
Higuera Guerrero, who is said to be the chief operating officer of
the Arellano Felix organization. The Tijuana-based cartel is said to
control the drug trade in the Mexican state of Baja California, the
busiest smuggling route into the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The cartel maintains its control through intimidation, bribery and
murder, officials said. Its alleged ringleader, Ramon Arellano Felix,
is on the FBI's 10 most wanted list and U.S. authorities are offering
a $2-million reward for his arrest or for that of his brother,
Benjamin.</TE>

<HD>Enron Could End Up Where It Started</HD>
<DH>Energy: The auctions of assets would remove core
businesses, leaving a pipeline operator.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Corp.'s proposed sale of its core energy-trading business to
UBS Warburg, raises the question: Without its crown jewel, what is
Enron?</LD>
<LD>   Until only a few months ago, the Houston-based company was the
world's largest energy trader and was pushing its vision of
deregulated markets into new states and new commodities.</LD>
<LD>   But now, under bankruptcy court protection, Enron is frantically
unloading assets, including its once-dominant trading operation, its
Oregon utility, its best natural gas pipeline and a variety of
international assets.</LD>
<TE>   If all of these deals are completed, Enron could end up much as it
began, a smallish operator of scattered pipelines.</TE>
<TE>   The heady days when Enron tried to dominate the energy world and
the halls of power are over, and its financial meltdown will haunt
for years whatever company survives in the form of lawsuits and
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   "Without these assets, Enron is not much," said utilities analyst
Andre Meade of Commerzbank Securities in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a very small entity. My guess is Enron just gets
liquidated and never emerges from bankruptcy ... or they might get
acquired," Meade said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron, recently 21,000 employees strong, has fired 6,200 workers
and will jettison even more in the months ahead through asset sales
and more expected layoffs. A company spokeswoman Monday could not say
how big the resulting company would be and how many people it would
employ.</TE>
<TE>   Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne acknowledged the shrinking of Enron
but said that "the pipelines are a self-sustaining business." Enron
began in 1985 as a traditional natural gas pipeline operator, so
"we'll be coming full circle," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The latest unloading of assets is the auction of Enron's trading
business to UBS Warburg, the New York-based investment banking arm of
Swiss financial services firm UBS. UBS won a bidding war Friday for
Enron's trading operation, which once handled an estimated 25% of all
the wholesale energy trading in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Enron and UBS were working to complete details of the agreement
Monday and delayed filing documents detailing the agreement with the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.</TE>
<TE>   Enron will sell the entire operation to UBS Warburg, rather than
the 51% ownership stake it previously was said to be negotiating,
according to published reports. UBS Warburg would pay no cash up
front for the business but would give Enron 33% of any pretax profit
generated by the trading business for at least two years.</TE>
<TE>   Enron has all but closed its trading operation, which employs
about 850 people and in 2000 generated 90% of the company's nearly
$101 billion in revenue. The sale does not include any existing
contracts for commodities, which are valued at more than $6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez will hold a hearing on the
proposed sale Friday, one day later than previously planned.</TE>
<TE>   Although Enron's creditor committee backs the sale to UBS Warburg,
some other creditors are objecting because they fear that profits
would find their way to Enron and not to creditors, who are owed more
than $31 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Enron recently agreed to let Dynegy Inc. buy the 17,000-mile
Northern Natural Gas Pipeline, which Enron had pledged as part of the
failed $9-billion takeover by its small cross-town rival.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy pulled out of the agreement Nov. 28, the day Enron fell
into junk-bond status, with Dynegy contending it had not realized the
depth of Enron's problems.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy is getting the pipeline for $23 million on top of the $1.5
billion in capital it had invested in Enron as part of the takeover
agreement. But Enron was mired in an all-but-fatal cash crunch as
investors and trading partners fled, and it filed for bankruptcy law
protection Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Enron still hopes to regain that pipeline as part of a $10-billion
lawsuit it filed against Dynegy for pulling out of the merger.</TE>
<TE>   Enron also owns all or part of three smaller pipelines. The
largest is Transwestern Pipeline, which operates 2,500 miles of pipe
between Texas and the California border. Other Enron businesses
include energy marketing and services, which sells electricity,
natural gas and energy-management services primarily to business
customers who want to bypass the traditional utility.</TE>
<TE>   Enron is selling assets including its Portland-based utility,
Portland General, and international power plants and other assets.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's trading business was well-regarded and if it can be
resurrected, it could give Enron a stream of profit "that would be a
nice little start of a business," said Chris Ellinghaus, utility
analyst with Williams Capital in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "The trading business has a lot of credibility to win back,"
Ellinghaus said. "But that was the part of Enron that actually
worked. It was all those other things that they got into that got
them into trouble" including investments in water and
telecommunications ventures.</TE>
<TE>   "If they had just stuck with the core business, they would have
done just fine," Ellinghaus said.</TE>

<HD>Burbank Finds Itself With an Abundance of Office Space</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Vacancy rates soar as new buildings open at
same time entertainment tenants scale back.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of turning away tenants from fully leased office
buildings, Burbank landlords are putting out the welcome mat.</LD>
<LD>   A surge in new construction, weak demand and the ongoing
retrenchment in the entertainment business--the city's largest
employer and user of office space--sent Burbank's once rock-bottom
vacancy rate soaring to 15.2% at the end of last year, according to
the real estate firm Insigna/ESG. Newly constructed office buildings
remain empty and landlords are being undercut by tenants who are
trying to sublet unwanted space at bargain rates.</LD>
<LD>   Despite talk of upcoming leasing deals and high levels of tenant
interest, most real estate observers don't expect Burbank's office
market, which totals about 6.5 million square feet of space, to show
noticeable improvement until the latter half of the year at the
earliest. Some forecast that vacancy will rise well beyond 20% as new
buildings to open.</LD>
<TE>   "You have [new space] coming on to the market at a time when
demand is not as great as it has been," said broker Bill Boyd at the
real estate firm Grubb &amp; Ellis. "The results will continue to spike
[up] the vacancy rate."</TE>
<TE>   During much of the 1990s, Burbank's office market was one of the
tightest in the region as rapidly expanding entertainment firms
packed into the high-rises in the city's Media District near the
Ventura Freeway and Alameda Avenue, an area within walking distance
of Walt Disney, Warner Bros. and NBC studios. With little room left
in the Media District, entertainment firms and related companies
began to expand into former industrial property near Burbank Airport
on the city's north side. Demand was strong enough that it overflowed
into high-rises along Brand Boulevard in neighboring Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   "There wasn't that much space available and there was an
incredible growth spurt," said broker Todd Doney of Insigna/ESG.</TE>
<TE>   By 1997, with vacancy falling below 5%, many developers began
planning a new wave of construction to take advantage of the hot
market. Now some of the projects conceived during the market's peak
are being completed amid lackluster demand. Burbank's office market
is expected to expand by about 15% during 2001 and 2002 as an
estimated 900,000 square feet of new space is completed, according to
Insigna/ESG.</TE>
<TE>   Unless developers put the brakes on planned projects, the city's
office vacancy rate could continue climbing well into 2003, according
to Insigna/ESG research executive Kevin Morrow.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take a lot of time to absorb all this new
construction," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The conditions have left prospective tenants with the luxury of
shopping for space in new and empty projects in the Media District
and near the airport. Landlords are often reluctant to reduce rents,
but not tenants, some of whom are offering to sublease excess space
at substantial discounts. In the airport area, for example, some
sublease space is being offered at 35% below the $27 per square foot
being sought by the typical landlord, Boyd said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to get attention of tenants at $27 when they can get
sublease space at $18," Boyd said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the long awaited Pinnacle, a 425,000-square-foot office
complex at Olive Avenue and the Ventura Freeway in the Media District
is due to be completed by April but has so far failed to land any
tenants. The building's chief leasing broker, Carl Muhlstein of
Cushman &amp; Wakefield, said it is not unusual for buildings to open
without any pre-leasing. He added that there has been substantial
interest in the Pinnacle, which is being built by one of Burbank's
largest developers, M. David Paul &amp; Associates, from tenants in
post-production, new media and financial services industries.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in heavy negotiations," Muhlstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Muhlstein and other real estate observers say that new
construction has made Burbank one of the few cities in the area with
large chunks of space suitable for large corporate tenants. Companies
including City National Bank, Turner Broadcasting and Warner Music
Group have been looking very closely as leasing large amounts of
space in Burbank, said several brokers.</TE>
<TE>   And even though entertainment firms continue to retrench, many
companies prefer to house their remaining operations as close as
possible to their headquarters and the entertainment industry
bastions of Burbank, said Jeffrey Worthe, who is overseeing the
Pinnacle for M. David Paul.</TE>
<TE>   "There has always been a demand to be in or near the studio lots,"
said Worthe, whose firm is also active in projects near Burbank
Airport. "They are not picking up and moving their studio lots."</TE>

<HD>Sunbeam's Ex-CEO Agrees to Settle Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>By Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Albert J. Dunlap, former Sunbeam Corp. chairman and chief executive,
agreed to pay $15 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit that
accused him and other former executives of mismanagement and fraud at
the small-appliance maker, attorneys said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The suit against Dunlap--dubbed "Chainsaw Al" for his record of
eagerly slashing jobs and expenses at troubled companies--stemmed
from the company's abrupt financial nose dive in the late-1990s.</LD>
<LD>   Sunbeam filed for bankruptcy protection a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   A trial in the case was due to begin Monday in federal court in
West Palm Beach, Fla., but the settlement was reached Friday,
according to Abraham Rappaport, one of the shareholders' lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Another lawyer for the investors, Robert Kornreich, said the
settlement still must be approved by a judge. "There are parts of
this that are still being discussed. It's been a long, tough
litigation."</TE>
<TE>   Dunlap, 64, admitted no wrongdoing as part of the settlement, said
his attorney Donald Zakarin.</TE>
<TE>   Sunbeam also caused problems for the accounting giant Andersen,
which now is embroiled in controversy surrounding its audits of
collapsed Enron Corp. Last year, Andersen agreed to pay $110 million
to settle securities-fraud litigation brought by Sunbeam
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Sunbeam marked the downfall of Dunlap. The maker of Oster mixers
and Mr. Coffee coffee makers hired Dunlap in mid-1996 to bolster
performance. His arrival came with great fanfare, because Dunlap
already had earned his reputation for unabashedly eliminating costs
to turn around other companies.</TE>
<TE>   Dunlap quickly unveiled a massive restructuring that called for
eliminating half of Sunbeam's 12,000 jobs and closing or selling most
of its 53 plants.</TE>
<TE>   But by 1998, things were going very wrong at Sunbeam. The Boca
Raton, Fla., company began forecasting losses and posting a much
higher debt load. Its accounting practices came under scrutiny by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. And in June 1998, Sunbeam's board
fired Dunlap.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Sunbeam was forced to restate its financial results
for the six quarters before Dunlap was ousted. Last May, the SEC
filed a civil lawsuit in federal court in Miami against Dunlap and
other former Sunbeam executives, along with accounting firm Andersen,
accusing them of engaging in a massive financial fraud. All the
defendants denied wrongdoing, and Dunlap called the charges
"baseless."</TE>
<TE>   Sunbeam never has fully recovered fully, despite introducing new
lines of appliances. A hearing on its bankruptcy reorganization plan
has been set for March 19.</TE>

<HD>Lehman Bros. Potentially Liable in Lending Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge says firm provided assistance to First
Alliance, accused of 'predatory' mortgage lending practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Santa Ana has made Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
potentially liable in the "predatory" mortgage lending case involving
bankrupt First Alliance Corp. The ruling could have far-reaching
consequences for Wall Street firms that increasingly have bankrolled
companies like First Alliance.</LD>
<LD>   In an order released Monday, U.S. District Judge David O. Carter
said Lehman, one of Wall Street's oldest firms, will be a defendant
in the consolidated case against First Alliance because Lehman's
funds and services provided "substantial assistance" to the Irvine
lender.</LD>
<LD>   "Lehman's credit facility made First Alliance's fraudulent
practices possible," Carter wrote, denying Lehman's motion to be
dismissed as a defendant on grounds that the New York firm provided
only routine commercial lending to First Alliance.</LD>
<TE>   Lawsuits by the Federal Trade Commission, six states and groups
representing numerous borrowers have been consolidated in a civil
case before Carter. Trial is set to begin April 9, although
settlement talks are continuing.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, First Alliance was making about $500 million a
year in mortgage loans, marketing them heavily to people who had
considerable home equity as well as high levels of credit card debt.</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuits accuse Brian Chisick, First Alliance's founder and
majority shareholder, of crafting an intricate spiel to hide the fact
that origination fees of up to 24% were wrapped into the loan amount.
The suits contend that salespeople also failed to disclose that the
initial rates on adjustable loans would soon rise far higher.</TE>
<TE>   The company filed for bankruptcy in March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Groups representing borrowers who are poor, minority or elderly,
like many of First Alliance's customers, hailed Carter's ruling. The
American Assn. of Retired Persons' suit against First Alliance alone
is seeking $305 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   By its own estimate, First Alliance has just $47 million in assets
that can be liquidated, so the addition of a defendant with deep
pockets such as Lehman could prove to be important to thousands of
former First Alliance borrowers who may have claims.</TE>
<TE>   William J. Ahearn, a Lehman spokesman, said Monday that the firm
will defend the suit vigorously and believes it's no more liable for
fraud than "the phone companies that provided phones so they [First
Alliance] could call up their customers and solicit them."</TE>
<TE>   Lehman has said it knew of allegations that First Alliance
concealed huge fees and other onerous loan terms from customers, but
believed the company cleaned up its act by the time Lehman became its
chief backer in 1999. It also maintains it can't be held responsible
for policing actions by loan originators like First Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   Lehman executives conducted a thorough investigation into First
Alliance practices in the mid-1990s and found them disturbing,
according to internal company memos made public in pre-trial
proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   First Alliance is "the used car salesperson of B/C lending,"
Lehman executive Eric Hibbert wrote in July 1995, using an industry
term for loans to people with blemished credit ratings. "It is a
requirement to leave your ethics at the door."</TE>
<TE>   Ahearn said that because of that finding, Lehman limited its
business with First Alliance to minor roles from 1995 through 1997,
when Prudential Securities was its main lender and bond underwriter.
Prudential bowed out in late 1998.</TE>
<TE>   From early 1999 until First Alliance's bankruptcy in March 2000,
Lehman was its chief backer. It provided a $150-million credit line
and bundled its mortgages for sale as securities every quarter,
although Hibbert was still expressing reservations. In January 1999,
Hibbert wrote that First Alliance at the very least was violating the
spirit of the Truth in Lending Act.</TE>
<TE>   First Alliance settled one class-action suit over its lending
practices in 1994. Additional suits piled up, including one by the
California attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, stopped making loans
and began liquidating after negative publicity, including questions
of Lehman's role, arose in March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   It is currently servicing about 350 loans it still owes and has
about a dozen full-time employees, among them Chisick, who no longer
earns a salary.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said that if Lehman is ultimately made liable in the
First Alliance case, it could force every Wall Street firm and
commercial bank that backs such firms to investigate clients more
carefully and proceed with greater caution in funding them. And that
in turn could cut into the amount of loans that are made.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Wall Street firms have played a big part in the
booming market in asset-backed securities, which are bonds backed by
payments on mortgages, credit cards, car loans and other revenue
streams. The total amount of such loans trading has grown from $316
billion in 1995 to $1.24 trillion as of Sept. 30, according to the
Bond Market Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Lehman profited by lending funds so First Alliance could make its
loans and by earning fees bundling these mortgages as securities and
selling them. Home-equity lenders such as First Alliance had
$178billion in such bonds out on Sept. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Grundleger, the top specialist in mortgage bonds for the
Fitch ratings agency, said the First Alliance case could cause a
ripple or "domino effect because everybody needs these [credit] lines
to get business done....It could cost more to operate, so there's
less profit to be had. And if there's less profit, there will be less
business done."</TE>
<TE>   Carter previously ruled that the Federal Trade Commission, the
lead plaintiff in the consolidated case, can include as defendants
Chisick and his wife, who made about $140 million when First Alliance
sold its shares to the public in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time the FTC had targeted an officer or director
of a public company as large as First Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   Lehman Bros. stock closed down $1 a share at $65.32 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>New Year Rally Fades as Profit Worries Further Damp Stocks</HD>
<DH>Markets: Investors are discouraged by statements from
Merrill Lynch strategist. Dow falls for sixth session.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a strong start to 2002, the stock market has faded over the
last week, raising fresh concerns that the fourth quarter's big rally
may have run out of gas.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street's advance in the first few days of this year was the
sign many hopeful investors were looking for: Historically, the
market's direction in the first five days of January has reliably
foretold its performance the rest of the year.</LD>
<LD>   But after an initial spurt in the new year, share prices have
turned soft since Jan. 4. Many analysts still think stocks will post
gains this year, but widespread projections of a robust January are
thus far being dashed.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average slipped for a sixth
straight day, falling 96.11 points, or 1%, to 9,891.42. The Nasdaq
composite index declined 31.72 points, or 1.6%, to 1,990.74--its
first close below 2,000 since Jan. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Dow and Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index are down year to
date, while Nasdaq clings to a 2.1% gain.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, stocks were hurt in part by negative comments by
Merrill Lynch's chief U.S. stock strategist, Richard Bernstein. He
advised clients to lighten their holdings of stocks, saying corporate
earnings won't recover quickly and terming share valuations
"extreme."</TE>
<TE>   He suggested clients reduce stocks to 50% of their total portfolio
from 60%, while boosting bond holdings to 30% from 20%. "Cash"
holdings should be the remaining 20% of holdings, Bernstein advised.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. market also was under pressure after a weak day in
Europe, where stocks were broadly lower. On the New York Stock
Exchange, losers topped winners 19 to 12 in moderate trading.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have been hoping for a strong January to boost investors'
confidence. Just as the trend in the first five trading days
historically has been a good indicator of the trend for the year, the
market's performance for the full month has more often than not been
predictive of the year.</TE>
<TE>   A big reason why stock prices often have rallied in January: Many
companies dole out annual bonuses this month, and workers often have
promptly funneled that cash into stocks.</TE>
<TE>   But that is not happening this year--at least not yet, some
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Since Jan. 1, individual investors have yanked a net $2.2 billion
from stock mutual funds, according to investment newsletter Liquidity
Trim Tabs. That's the first time since the newsletter began tracking
the trend in 1994 that the start of the year has been greeted with
outflows.</TE>
<TE>   Since Christmas, stock fund net outflows have totaled $1.2
billion. By contrast, a net $25 billion poured into stock funds in
the comparable period last year, according to Liquidity Trim Tabs.</TE>
<TE>   Stung by their losses in recent years, individual investors are
reluctant to devote much new cash to stocks, said Charles Biderman,
the newsletter's president.</TE>
<TE>   "If you were one of the people who [helped to] put in $25 billion
last year and then watched [the market] collapse ... are you going to
put money into the market now?" Biderman said.</TE>
<TE>   The market's stumble Monday could be traced partially to Alan
Greenspan's comments on Friday, analysts said. The Federal Reserve
chief warned of "significant" economic risks and said the U.S.
economy might not snap back as quickly as many people have hoped.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all teed up to go higher ... and then Greenspan came out
and basically threw cold water on the rally," said Robert Nichols,
chairman of Windward Capital Management in Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Moskow, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago,
sounded a more upbeat tone on Monday, but investors were unmoved.</TE>
<TE>   The market's fourth-quarter rally was based on the belief that the
economy was showing clear signs of improvement, and that a rebound in
corporate earnings was not far behind, experts note. Now, it appears
that "the [economic] recovery will occur, but it may not happen in
the first quarter, and a lot of people were counting on that,"
Nichols said.</TE>
<TE>   Many investors are holding off on new stock purchases until
fourth-quarter corporate earnings reports--which will begin pouring
out this week--give a clearer picture of the outlook for 2002,
analysts say. Many companies use the reports to discuss the year
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks may be eschewing their traditional January rally in part
because the market's normal dynamics were sped up by the Sept. 11
attacks, said John Bollinger, a money manager and author of
"Bollinger on Bollinger Bands."</TE>
<TE>   Many institutions that might have been planning to dump stocks
later in the year did so immediately after the attacks, he said.
Then, purchases that might have occurred later in the year were
accelerated as stock prices hit three-year lows after the attacks, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, many investors appear anxious to harvest their gains from the
fourth-quarter rally, Bollinger said. "A lot of people are, frankly,
squaring their books and taking their money out of the market," he
said.</TE>

<HD>3 Arden Execs to Utilize New Firm</HD>
<DH>The top officers plan to focus on Southland industrial
properties by investing through Rexford Industrial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB HOWARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three top executives of Southern California's biggest owner of office
buildings, Arden Realty Inc., plan to invest heavily in Southland
industrial properties through a new company called Rexford Industrial
LLC.</LD>
<LD>   The Arden executives--Richard Ziman, Victor Coleman and Andrew
Sobel--are partners in the new venture with Rexford's founder and
managing member Howard Schwimmer, a former industrial broker with
Daum Commercial Real Estate who left that company at the end of last
year to form Rexford.</LD>
<LD>   Ziman is chairman and chief executive, Coleman is president and
chief operating officer and Sobel is an executive vice president at
West Los Angeles-based Arden, a publicly held real estate investment
trust that owns more than 18 million square feet of office buildings.
Privately held Rexford also is based in West Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Rexford has already bid on more than $15 million worth of
industrial property and expects to invest $80 million to $100 million
per year for the next four or five years, said Schwimmer, who owns
interests in about $50 million worth of industrial property through a
number of partnerships he formed with other investors during his 19
years with Daum.</TE>
<TE>   Rexford will focus on older industrial properties within about an
hour's drive of downtown Los Angeles, Schwimmer said, and the
company's strategy will be to buy the buildings on a "long-term hold"
basis for continued cash flow.</TE>
<TE>   Schwimmer sees more potential profit in older Class B and C
buildings than modern Class A buildings for a number of reasons.</TE>
<TE>   First, he said, modern industrial properties are considerably more
expensive because they are extremely popular with big institutional
investors such as pension funds, life insurance companies and real
estate investment trusts, which can afford to pay much higher prices
than smaller private investors.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the economic slump has reduced rents more in older
buildings than in modern industrial projects, Schwimmer said, meaning
savvy investors can find better bargains in the older variety. Rents
have dipped by about 4% to 8% for the best industrial space, he
estimated, compared with drops of nearly 25% for some older space.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is too much of an opportunity to make money
on Class A property. There are too many people bidding on it, which
drives up the prices," Schwimmer said. "Not as many people want to
buy an older building that has a lot of functional problems that are
going to take a lot of time and energy to resolve."</TE>
<TE>   The Rexford strategy "sounds like a good plan," said Darla Longo,
a CB Richard Ellis broker who specializes in industrial properties.</TE>
<TE>   "The only challenge they're going to have is digging up the
deals," Longo said, "but that's what Howard did at Daum, so it should
work if he is the guy who will be finding the deals."</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AT&amp;T Corp. and other cable television companies' share of the U.S.
pay-TV market slid last year as satellite rivals signed up customers
at a faster rate, the Federal Communications Commission said.</LD>
<LD>   EchoStar Communications Corp. and other satellite-TV firms
increased their subscriber base to 19.3 million homes as of June
2001, up 15% from a year earlier, the report said. Cable had 78% of
homes in June, down from 80%.</LD>
<LD>   Policymakers are focusing on competition between cable and
satellite broadcasters as regulators review EchoStar's proposed
$35-billion purchase of Hughes Electronics Corp., parent of DirecTV,
the only rival to EchoStar's Dish network. The FCC also is rewriting
a limit on the number of homes a single cable company may serve.</LD>
<TE>   Overall, 88.3 million households paid for video services as of
June 2001, up 4.6% from 84.4 million homes the previous year. Cable
TV had 69 million subscribers, a 1.9% increase from the previous
year. Cable prices rose 4.24% during the year, while the consumer
price index increased 3.25%.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid fierce opposition from mobile phone carriers, state lawmakers on
Monday quashed a measure that would have made it illegal to drive
while using a handheld cellular phone.</LD>
<LD>   The cell phone driving bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Joe Simitian
(D-Palo Alto), fell one vote short of the 10 votes needed to move it
out of the Assembly Transportation Committee. Four members voted
against the measure and six members did not cast a vote, Simitian
said.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, which also was beaten by one vote last summer, closely
followed regulations that have cropped up in New York state and
elsewhere amid concerns about the risks of cell phone use in moving
vehicles.</LD>
<TE>   Simitian's measure would have made it illegal for drivers to talk
on a mobile phone without using a hands-free device, such as a
headset, except in an emergency. The penalty would have been equal to
the penalty for breaking the state's seat-belt law.</TE>
<TE>   After the late-afternoon vote, Simitian said the bill fell victim
to intense lobbying from wireless service providers AT&amp;T Wireless,
Cingular, Sprint PCS and others. Verizon Wireless was the only
carrier to support the measure.</TE>
<TE>   "All of them tell their customers not to drive a car and use their
phone without a hands-free device, yet they have been absolutely
fierce in their opposition" to regulation, Simitian said.</TE>
<TE>   To ward off Simitian's measure, the wireless companies proposed a
substitute bill aimed broadly at restricting "distracting activity"
in a car.</TE>
<TE>   Simitian vowed to reintroduce a new version of the handheld cell
phone ban in a few weeks.</TE>

<LD>Santa Monica-based MJW Investments Inc. said it has received the
entitlements it needs from the City of Los Angeles to go ahead with a
large office, retail and housing project in the Fashion District of
downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Company President Mark J. Weinstein said his firm will proceed
with plans to build 604 loft-style apartments and about
200,000-square-feet of retail, office and other commercial space. The
project, which is called Santee Court, features the conversion of
numerous garment manufacturing buildings on three blocks located
between Seventh Street and Olympic Boulevard. The renovated
structures will be linked by existing alleyways and tunnels.</LD>
<LD>   Weinstein said one building is already in the process of being
converted into office and fashion showroom space. The first phase of
housing, amounting to 171 units, is scheduled to be completed by
September 2003, said Weinstein, whose firm owns and manages about 2
million square feet of commercial space and about 1,000 apartments in
California.</LD>

<TE>   The city of El Segundo has approved plans by Los Angeles-based
Thomas Properties Group to transform a former Rockwell aerospace
facility into a 46-acre corporate campus.</TE>
<TE>   The El Segundo City Council approved the proposal over the
objections of a group supported by Kilroy Realty Corp., which owns an
office complex near the Thomas Properties' development site. The
opposition group, citing concerns about increased traffic congestion,
has threatened to launch a referendum campaign against the project if
city leaders approved the plans.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Properties' plans for the El Segundo Corporate Campus
include more than 2 million square feet of office and other
commercial space for the property, which is located east of Sepulveda
Boulevard between Nash and Douglas streets.</TE>
<TE>   The site also will include space for a fire station, day-care
center and five acres for soccer fields.</TE>
<TE>   No commercial space at the project has been pre-leased to tenants,
according to spokesman David Herbst.</TE>
<TE>   The property was once the site of a proposed distribution center
for Federal Express.</TE>
<TE>   But the shipping company dropped its proposal after it was
rejected by the city.</TE>

<HD>ETrade 4th-Quarter Net Income Jumps</HD>
<DH>Brokerages: Cost cutting and a push into businesses other
than trading help lift profit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Online brokerage ETrade Group Inc. posted a sharp increase in
fourth-quarter earnings Monday, helped largely by cost cuts and gains
from businesses other than stock trading.</LD>
<LD>   But the Menlo Park, Calif.-based company also said its trading
volumes rose compared with the third quarter as share prices
rebounded, suggesting that the long decline in discount brokers'
commission revenues may have reached at least a temporary bottom. The
company gave an upbeat forecast for 2002 results overall.</LD>
<LD>   ETrade said fourth-quarter net income was $21.6 million, or 6
cents a share, up from $1.4 million, or break-even per share, a year
earlier. But the latest quarter's results included a one-time gain
from the early payoff of debt. Excluding that gain, ETrade said
earnings were $7.7 million, or 2 cents a diluted share.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue rose 3.3% to $345 million from $334 million a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The company's push into banking, mortgage services, insurance and
other non-brokerage lines has helped offset still-weak results in
stock trading, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the profit driver has been the diversification model,"
ETrade President Jerry Gramaglia said.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, ETrade said it processed an average of 110,000 securities
trades a day in the fourth quarter, up 21% from the third-quarter
total, though down from 150,000 trades a day in the fourth quarter of
2000. Brokerage commission revenue totaled $90.7 million in the
latest quarter, up from $71 million in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   As investors' interest in the market has waned, ETrade slashed its
marketing outlays. Total marketing costs in the fourth quarter were
$54 million, down from $97 million a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Helped by diversification, ETrade said it expects earnings of 45
to 55 cents a share in 2002, excluding goodwill charges and other
one-time items. Wall Street had been expecting about 38 cents a
share.</TE>
<TE>   The company's stock fell 11 cents to $12.20 on the New York Stock
Exchange in regular trading, then rose to $12.67 in after-hours
activity, following the earnings report.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Enron Execs Launch Firm to Market Energy</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Several former Enron Corp. executives launched Monday a firm to
market energy services to small and medium-sized businesses instead
of large industrial customers the bankrupt giant had sought.</LD>
<LD>   Celeren Corp. was negotiating the final details of an expected
$15-million deal with its first customer, a New York firm, and
expected to announce that deal by the end of next week, said
President Thomas A. Brigger.</LD>
<LD>   Brigger, Celeren Chief Operating Officer Donald S. Parker and
others left Enron in July to organize their new venture, well before
the Houston-based energy trader rocked the financial world with its
Oct. 16 disclosure of a $638-million third-quarter loss and its
bankruptcy filing Dec. 2.</LD>
<TE>   Brigger had been mid-Atlantic regional manager for Enron Energy
Services' outsource fulfillment operation, and Parker had been
mid-Atlantic regional director of asset risk management.</TE>
<TE>   "The group we were with, Enron Energy Services, was doing very
well. Our group had nothing to do with accounting," Brigger said.</TE>

Buenos Aires, above, and throughout Latin America as BankBoston, said
it will delay releasing its quarterly results until later this month
because it wants time to assess how the financial crisis in Argentina
will affect the bank's sizable loan book. FleetBoston has about $6
billion in loans in Argentina. Last month, the company  announced a
$150-million charge to write down Argentine government securities and
loans.</CP>

<HD>Compaq, HP Detail Retention Bonuses</HD>
<DH>Merger: Packages are designed to keep important employees
during integration of the technology companies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. and Compaq Computer Corp. would shell out $634
million in bonuses to key employees as an incentive to stay on board
if their merger goes through, the companies disclosed Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Hewlett-Packard would pay $33.1 million to 10 top executives and
$337 million to about 6,000 selected employees over two years,
according to an updated merger prospectus filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Compaq would pay $22.4 million to seven top executives and $242
million to an undisclosed number of employees over two years, the
filing said.</LD>
<TE>   The companies disclosed in their original prospectus on Nov. 15
that HP Chief Carly Fiorina had turned down a merger-related bonus
package that would have been worth $8 million, and that Compaq leader
Michael Capellas forfeited a $14.4-million plan. Both companies said
the CEOs wanted to avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest as
they fight hard for the deal.</TE>
<TE>   The retention bonuses are designed to keep important employees
during the difficult integration of the massive technology companies.
HP has 86,000 employees; Compaq has 66,500. At least 15,000 layoffs
are expected if the deal goes through.</TE>
<TE>   HP's bonus plan was crafted by board members Sam Ginn, Phil Condit
and Walter Hewlett, the co-founder's son who originally voted for the
deal and is now encouraging shareholders to torpedo it.</TE>
<TE>   Compaq's retention package was developed by directors Lawrence
Babbio, Judith Craven and Kenneth Lay, the head of shattered Enron
Corp. Lay resigned from Compaq's board last month.</TE>
<TE>   HP and Compaq say their $24.2-billion deal is essential for their
long-term growth and would bolster their position in servers, data
storage, personal computing and high-tech services. The companies
expect merging would save at least $2.5 billion a year by 2004, or $5
to $9 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents believe the deal is too risky, would shrink the
contribution of HP's profitable printing division and overexpose the
company to the weak personal-computer market. Hewlett and Packard
family interests with 18% of HP shares are against the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Palo Alto-based HP and Houston-based Compaq are awaiting
regulatory approval before setting a date for a shareholder vote.</TE>
<TE>   European regulators have until Jan. 31 to announce a decision on
the deal or to inform the companies they need more time to study it.</TE>
<TE>   HP shares fell 36 cents, about 1.5%, to $22.52 on the New York
Stock Exchange, while Compaq lost 36 cents, or 3%, to $11.14, also on
the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>States May Sue to Block Deal Between EchoStar and Hughes</HD>
<DH>Merger: Critics say the combined company would have a
monopoly in rural areas where cable TV is not available.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Several state attorneys general are discussing the possibility of
filing suit to block satellite television provider EchoStar
Communications Corp.'s bid to buy rival Hughes Electronics Corp., an
official with Missouri's attorney general said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   As many as 30 attorneys general are conducting "due diligence" to
decide whether the proposed combination of the two biggest satellite
TV companies would hobble competition in the pay television market,
said Chuck Hatfield, an assistant to Missouri  Atty. Gen. Jay Nixon.</LD>
<LD>   "There are several attorneys general who are deeply concerned
about the proposed merger who are convinced, based on what we know so
far, that the merger is anti-competitive and should be stopped,"
Hatfield said.</LD>
<TE>   But Hatfield said the states have made no final decision about
whether to sue. "We're going through a process to try to make sure we
have a good understanding of the details in the market and the
technology," Hatfield said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the states are especially concerned about how the deal
would affect rural areas where many residents have no access to cable
television and are more dependent on satellite TV.</TE>
<TE>   Antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department are reviewing the
deal, along with the Federal Communications Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Some U.S. lawmakers and regulators have said they're concerned
that allowing the No. 1 direct broadcast satellite firm, DirecTV, and
No. 2 EchoStar to combine would reduce the number of competitors in
the pay-television market from three to two.</TE>
<TE>   In rural areas where cable television is not available, critics
argue, the merged company would end up with a monopoly.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for EchoStar and Hughes said the companies are
cooperating with the states and said the discussions are routine.
"They're in a learning mode," said EchoStar spokesman Mark Lumpkin.
"Once we're able to discuss it with them, we think they'll see the
numerous benefits the merger provides, especially in rural areas."</TE>

<HD>Suit Filed Over 'Good Driver' Discount Rates</HD>
<DH>Insurance: An advocacy group claims Geico, the Auto Club
and Safeco overcharge those without prior coverage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A consumer advocate group has sued three auto insurers, alleging the
companies violated California's Proposition 103 by overcharging new
customers who lacked prior insurance coverage.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights
claims that Safeco Insurance Co., Geico Corp. and the Automobile Club
of Southern California are ignoring the law by not giving
"good-driver" discounts to uninsured motorists who apply for
coverage.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court, claims
that the three companies also "knowingly and actively" concealed the
practice from regulators and consumers.</LD>
<TE>   An Auto Club spokeswoman said Monday the insurer was following the
law and that its rates had not been questioned by regulators.</TE>
<TE>   "We file all of our rating plans with the Department of Insurance
and we rely on their approval to make sure we're in compliance," said
spokeswoman Carol Thorp.</TE>
<TE>   Geico did not return calls for comment and a Safeco spokesman said
he could not comment about ongoing litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 103, which voters approved in 1988, was designed to
reduce auto rates and change insurers' underwriting practices. The
law requires insurers to give certain customers a 20% "good-driver"
discount, and says that lack of prior insurance coverage "in and of
itself shall not be a criterion for determining eligibility."</TE>
<TE>   Lack of insurance also can't be used to determine premiums or a
driver's insurability.</TE>
<TE>   Foundation spokeswoman Pam Pressley said the lawsuits were
prompted by the group's research using the companies' Web sites.
Applicants who clicked a box indicating that they were not currently
covered by insurance were quoted higher rates by the three companies
than when the applicants indicated they already had insurance, she
said. The rates were later confirmed by insurance agents, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups have battled with Auto Club and Safeco before over
the issue of what to charge previously uninsured drivers. In 1996, a
San Francisco Superior Court judge invalidated efforts by the two
insurers to impose surcharges on such drivers.</TE>
<TE>   The number of drivers who might be affected by the lawsuit is
unclear. Insurers estimate about 22% of drivers statewide, and one
out of three drivers in Los Angeles, are uninsured, but it is not
known how many of those drivers apply for coverage each year.</TE>
<TE>   The Auto Club is California's fifth-largest auto insurer, with
8.7% of the market. Geico has a 2.6% market share while Safeco writes
1.6% of the state's coverage by premium.</TE>
<TE>   The Geico group of insurance companies is owned by Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. Safeco is a subsidiary of Safeco Corp. The Auto Club is
a membership organization.</TE>

<HD>Ivax Wins Decision in Patent Dispute</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ivax Corp. said a U.S. District Court judge invalidated American
BioScience Inc.'s patent claims on Ivax's generic version of Taxol,
the latest in a long-running patent dispute over the cancer drug.</LD>
<LD>   Ivax last month asked the judge in Los Angeles to rule that a
Taxol-related patent held by ABI was invalid because it didn't cover
anything new. Ivax has accused the drug's original marketer,
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., of using ABI to help delay generic
competition on Taxol by listing the ABI patent in the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration's patent registry.</LD>
<LD>   Ivax started selling its copy of Taxol, a drug with annual sales
of about $1.6 billion, in October 2000 after a ruling against
Bristol-Myers and the court-ordered removal of American BioScience's
patent from the FDA registry. ABI has contested the approval of
Ivax's drug.</LD>
<TE>   "What this means is that it's about 90% resolved but still not
100% resolved," said Steven Valiquette, an analyst at UBS Warburg who
has a "strong buy" rating on Ivax. "There's still the possibility of
an [ABI] appeal in California, and we don't yet know how D.C. court
will rule."</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 6, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
said the FDA erred in approving the generic, jeopardizing Ivax's
right to sell the drug. Ivax separately has asked for reconsideration
of that ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Ivax announced the latest ruling in a statement. Shares of
Miami-based Ivax rose 20 cents to $20.83 on the American Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "The summary judgment [in California] helps Ivax, because if it
had gone to a full court, Ivax's right to sell the drug may have been
temporarily revoked while the court decided," said Valiquette, who
said he doesn't own shares of Ivax.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>KPMG, the third-largest U.S. accounting firm, was censured by the
Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday for auditing a
money-market fund at the same time that it was investing in the fund.</LD>
<LD>   New York-based KPMG audited the financial statements of the
Short-Term Investments Trust, a government money market fund in AIM
Management Group Inc.'s family of funds, even though it had deposited
more than $25 million in the trust, the SEC said.</LD>
<LD>   The case comes as SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt is under pressure to
toughen his approach to the accounting industry after the collapse of
Enron Corp. The SEC is investigating Enron and its auditor, Andersen,
whose independence as an auditor was questioned because it also
worked as a consultant to Enron.</LD>
<TE>   "Ours was an inadvertent investment made only because we invested
in what we thought was a mutual fund sponsored by someone who wasn't
a client," KPMG spokesman George Ledwith said. "We're confident all
our audit work performed for AIM was appropriate and conducted in
accordance with professional standards."</TE>
<TE>   KPMG, which didn't have to pay a financial penalty, consented to
the SEC's order while neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing. The
SEC said no investors were harmed by KPMG's audit independence
failure.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC case is the second brought against KPMG for
audit-independence violations in recent years. A year ago, the SEC
held that KPMG failed to maintain its independence in a 1995 audit of
Porta Systems Corp., a telecommunications equipment company. KPMG is
appealing the decision to a federal court.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG initially deposited $25 million in Short-Term Investments
Trust in May 2000 and made 11 additional investments in the next two
months. Neither the SEC nor KPMG would disclose the highest amount
that the accounting firm invested in the fund.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG, which invested in the fund until December 2000, mistakenly
told AIM that it had no investment in AIM funds during the period,
the SEC said. After learning of its conflict of interest, the
accounting firm withdrew its money and paid another auditor to review
the fund's finances, the order said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said KPMG's independence violations "occurred primarily
because the firm lacked adequate policies or procedures to prevent or
detect such violations." KPMG officials failed to check whether the
accounting firm was Short-Term Investments Trust's auditor before
making an investment. KPMG has agreed to improve its audit
independence monitoring, the SEC said.</TE>

<HD>MGM for Sale for $7 Billion, Sources Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER, CLAUDIA ELLER and JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. has put itself up for sale and hired
investment banking firm Goldman Sachs to solicit bids that are due
this week, according to sources with knowledge of the auction.</LD>
<LD>   MGM, which is controlled by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, is looking
for a price of $7 billion or more for the legendary studio, which is
valued on Wall Street at about $5 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the major studios are interested in MGM's vast film
library, which includes the Pink Panther and James Bond movies. MGM's
4,100 movie titles could help Viacom Inc. feed its Showtime movie
channel, or Walt Disney Co. shore up its weak live-action film
library.</LD>
<TE>   But none of the studios are believed to have submitted a bid,
concerned that the price is too steep, according to sources. In
addition to Viacom and Disney, the potential bidders include Vivendi
Universal, News Corp. and AOL Time Warner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Neither these companies nor MGM Chairman Alex Yemenidjian would
comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   MGM's current management team has tried to use the company's film
library to expand into the cable business. A year ago, MGM paid
Cablevision Systems Corp. $825 million for a 20% stake in its four
national cable channels, which include American Movie Classics and
Bravo.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts say MGM lacks the scale to compete against the media
giants that have come to dominate the entertainment industry over the
last decade. Led by AOL Time Warner, these conglomerates control both
film and television production and cable and broadcast distribution
outlets.</TE>
<TE>   Kerkorian, 84, has been one of the few holdouts in the recent
merger frenzy, though sources say he has made a merger deal a
priority for MGM. Worth $5.3 billion, Kerkorian is looking for a
tax-free stock transaction that would give him a stake in the
acquirer.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, MGM's management team has conceded that
remaining independent no longer may be realistic.</TE>
<TE>   Yemenidjian has had conversations with potential partners,
including Sony Pictures Entertainment and DreamWorks SKG, according
to company sources. Late last year, MGM thought it was close to
merging with Sony Pictures Entertainment until Sony Corp. Chief
Executive Nobuyuki Idei nixed the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Kerkorian is seeking at least $30 a share for the company,
according to several Hollywood sources. On Monday, MGM's shares
closed at $19.88, down 50 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   But Kerkorian may have trouble getting that kind of a premium
because many potential buyers are stretched thin. Disney is
struggling to justify to Wall Street the record $5.2 billion it paid
in November to buy Fox Family Worldwide, owner of the newly renamed
ABC Family cable channel. AOL Time Warner is facing a $6.75-billion
purchase of a stake in AOL Europe and an even more expensive buyout
of AT&amp;T's 25% of HBO, Warner Bros. and various cable systems.</TE>
<TE>   Kerkorian, who controls about 80% of MGM, bought the company for a
third time in 1996 when he led a $1.3-billion buyout from Credit
Lyonnais. The French bank auctioned off MGM after seizing the studio
in 1992 from Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, now under
indictment for allegedly acquiring the company through sham
transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Kerkorian first acquired MGM in 1969, selling it in 1986 to Ted
Turner. But he reacquired most of the assets when Turner became
financially squeezed in the deal, although Turner kept 300 films
including "Gone With the Wind."</TE>
<TE>   Since reacquiring MGM six years ago, Kerkorian has pumped about $4
billion into the company, acquiring Orion Pictures, the film library
of PolyGram Pictures and providing funds for the studio.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999 MGM agreed to pay Warner Bros. more than $225 million to
end a video distribution agreement and regain control of its
post-1996 library, including such titles as "Rain Man" and "Thelma
and Louise."</TE>

<HD>Energy Stocks Fall as Oil Prices Slide</HD>
<DH>Commodities: Crude inventories are high because of mild
weather. Gas prices remain lower except on the West Coast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Energy stocks fell again Monday as oil prices continued their recent
slide.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of integrated oil companies and oil field services firms
slipped after crude oil fell to a one-month low on expectations that
U.S. inventories will stay abundant, as forecasts for mild weather
signaled that refiners will restrict heating oil production.
Meanwhile, gasoline prices dipped slightly nationally, but rose on
the West Coast.</LD>
<LD>   "We have tons of heating oil out there, which is weighing on the
market," said David Becker, energy derivatives trading manager at
Citibank in New York. Crude inventories will have to decline to push
prices higher, "but in these conditions, that's not going to happen."</LD>
<TE>   Crude oil for February delivery fell 79 cents, or 4%, to $18.89 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest closing price
since Dec. 13.</TE>
<TE>   Prices have fallen more than 12% since Jan. 4, reversing the surge
that followed an agreement by OPEC and other oil exporters last month
to cut production by 2 million barrels a day. The cuts were an
attempt to boost prices, which have fallen 30% since the terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The recent slide has dried up some of the enthusiasm for energy
stocks, which had climbed along with oil prices in late December.
Three of the 10 worst-performing sectors so far this year in the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index are oil-related.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the CBOE index of integrated oil companies fell more
than 1%, as shares of 10 of its 11 members fell. Leading the index
down were Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., off 87 cents to $47.40; Phillips
Petroleum Co., off 91 cents to $58.34; and Amerada Hess Corp., down
93 cents to $58.98. The index is down 3.9% year to date.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, all 15 members of the Philadelphia index of oil service
companies fell, with Nabors Industries Inc. falling $1.17 to $28.30
and BJ Services Co. losing $1.49 to $25.71. Among the industry's
biggest names, Schlumberger lost 61 cents to $50.81 and Halliburton
Co. slipped 18 cents to $10.77. The index's Monday loss of 2.9%
deepened its year-to-date decline to --12.6%.</TE>
<TE>   Though hard on energy investors, the slide in oil prices is a boon
to motorists in many parts of the country. U.S. retail gasoline
prices fell for the first time in four weeks over the last week, the
Energy Department reported Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, the average pump price dipped 0.1 cents to $1.111 a
gallon. Analysts said falling crude prices and the traditional drop
in demand after the holiday driving season contributed to the
decline.</TE>
<TE>   However, West Coast gas prices jumped 3.3 cents to $1.184 a
gallon, making the region's prices the nation's highest. Production
cutbacks at California refineries are partly to blame for the higher
prices.</TE>

<HD>M&amp;F Worldwide Overpaid for Panavision, Analyst Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>M&amp;F Worldwide Corp. officials paid about $200 million more than they
should have for financier Ronald Perelman's majority stake in movie
camera maker Panavision Inc., an investment analyst testified.</LD>
<LD>   Executives at M&amp;F, in which Perelman owns a 35% stake, agreed to
pay $190 million for his 83% of Panavision last year. Shareholders
who sued over the purchase said it was engineered to bail the
billionaire financier out of a bad investment.</LD>
<LD>   Panavision was loaded with debt and faced problems making payments
on its bonds, said Elliot Larner, an analyst with New York's Tweedy
Browne Co.</LD>
<TE>   "I felt MFW overpaid for Panavision by something like $200
million," which would have been the entire purchase price, Larner
said as the trial of M&amp;F shareholders' suits over the Panavision
purchase began in Delaware Chancery Court.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly half a dozen M&amp;F investors say the firm's board wasn't
looking out for shareholders' best interests in agreeing to buy out
Perelman, best known as chairman of cosmetics maker Revlon Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Woodland Hills-based Panavision, which have risen 22%
over the last 12 months, rose 10 cents to close at $4.75 on the New
York Stock Exchange. M&amp;F's shares, which have fallen 7% in the same
period, dipped 8 cents to close at $4.45, also on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Fleet VP Joins Former Boss at Providian</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Providian Financial Corp., hurt by rising credit card losses, hired
FleetBoston Financial Corp.'s Warren Wilcox as vice chairman of
planning and marketing to help lure customers more likely to pay
their bills.</LD>
<LD>   Wilcox reports to Chief Executive Joseph Saunders, who had been
his boss as head of FleetBoston's credit card unit until November.
The two also worked at Household International, the largest U.S.
consumer-finance firm.</LD>
<LD>   The sixth-biggest U.S. Visa and MasterCard issuer is trying to
attract more middle-income customers as more cardholders with poor
credit histories can't pay their credit card bills in the slowing
economy. Federal regulators prohibited Providian from adding any more
risky cardholders after third-quarter profit fell 71%. Providian
shares gained 27 cents Monday to close at $4.60 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   Wilcox started in the newly created position last week. "He will
play a major role in our efforts to restructure Providian," Saunders
said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   At FleetBoston Wilcox had been executive vice president of credit
card planning and development since 1998. Previously, he spent 12
years at Household.</TE>

<HD>Raytheon Selling Key Military Unit to Help Trim Debt</HD>
<DH>Defense: All-cash, $1.13-billion deal sends aircraft
integration systems operation to L-3 Communications.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTIN ROBERTS</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Defense contractor Raytheon Co. said Monday that it will sell its
aircraft integration systems business to L-3 Communications Holdings
Inc. for $1.13 billion to cut its heavy debt load.</LD>
<LD>   The all-cash transaction rids Raytheon of an underperforming
aircraft electronics operation, but one that some Wall Street
analysts saw as a "core" business.</LD>
<LD>   For L-3, the deal represents its largest acquisition to date,
potentially doubling its annual revenue by one-third for the maker of
secure communications networks for the U.S. government and airline
black box flight data recorders.</LD>
<TE>   The Aircraft Integration Systems unit "is a national defense asset
that for decades has had a special relationship with the U.S.
intelligence community," said L-3 Chief Executive Frank Lanza. "It is
a solid company with excellent management, and is in a market niche
we know well and serve with our secure communications and electronic
products."</TE>
<TE>   The transaction covers most of Raytheon's Greenville, Texas-based
AIS unit, which modernizes commercial and military aircraft and
specializes in advanced avionics as well as surveillance and
reconnaissance systems. Raytheon said it will hold on to the Astor
program, a $1.3-billion contract with Britain's Ministry of Defense,
awarded in 1999. Astor is an advanced airborne radar surveillance
system that provides day, night and all-weather imagery of the ground
over a large area.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of both Raytheon and L-3 fell on the New York Stock
Exchange. Raytheon lost 34 cents to $31.68 while L-3 dropped 84 cents
to $88.17.</TE>
<TE>   "From Raytheon's perspective, I view it as largely a debt pay-down
focus," said Christopher Mecray, analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex.
Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "I do believe it is a core business for them," Mecray said.
"However, it's a business with a Catch-22 and that is because they
have volatile revenue stream and backlog making it difficult to
manage."</TE>
<TE>   The entire aircraft integration systems operation employs more
than 6,000 people. The piece being sold to L-3 generated 2001 sales
of about $900 million.</TE>
<TE>   Raytheon expects a taxable gain on the sale but an accounting loss
due to the amount of goodwill associated with Raytheon's 1995
acquisition of E-Systems. The L-3 transaction, therefore, should
slightly lower 2002 earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the transaction allows Raytheon to shed debt, which it
incurred after a spree of acquisitions in the 1990s and stood at $8.8
billion at the end of the third quarter of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Raytheon said that most of the $1.13 billion in cash from L-3
would be used to reduce debt.</TE>
<TE>   This infusion of cash follows a stock offering in late 2001 that
was expected to generate $1 billion, also used to reduce debt.</TE>
<TE>   Raytheon Chief Executive Daniel Burnham said the sale gives it the
"financial flexibility and the strategic resources" to focus on areas
such as missile defense; precision strike weapons systems; and
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance electronics.</TE>
<TE>   L-3 expects the transaction to increase its 2002 diluted earnings
per share by 20 cents, after considering the effects of financing the
deal.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based L-3, which buys specialized defense businesses,
said it expects to offer and sell about $1 billion of debt and equity
securities during the first half of this year to retire the interim
financing and repay the outstanding balance under a revolving credit
facility.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Further details have emerged about the agreement by upscale U.S.
shopping mall owner Rodamco North America to a $2.2-billion buyout
offer by Westfield America Inc., Simon Property Group Inc. and Rouse
Co., ending a five-month takeover battle.</LD>
<LD>   Much of the assets of Rotterdam, Netherlands-based Rodamco, which
include posh properties such as Bergdorf Goodman on New York's 5th
Avenue and Copley Place in Boston, were won by Westfield America.</LD>
<LD>   Westfield is a major Australian property group run by Frank Lowy,
who ranks as Australia's second-richest man with an estimated fortune
of close to $2 billion. The company's U.S. operations are based in
Brentwood.</LD>
<TE>   The buyers offered $2.2 billion for the company's equity and will
pick up $3.1 billion of Rodamco's debt.</TE>
<TE>   Including the debt, Rodamco's total price tag amounts to about
$5.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Westfield already operates 39 shopping malls in the United States
and has agreed to buy nine more. Westfield would take on 14 of
Rodamco's 35 malls, including all its California holdings, and said
the acquisitions would make it the No. 2 U.S. mall operator.</TE>
<TE>   The deal would strengthen the portfolio of Indianapolis-based
Simon Property Group, the No. 1 U.S. mall operator, which would take
13 of Rodamco's malls, including the Galleria in Houston. Columbia,
Md.-based Rouse would assume the eight others, including Chicago's
Water Tower Place.</TE>
<TE>   Westfield's share of the transaction is valued at about
$2.3billion, and Simon and Rouse would pay $1.55billion and
$1.45billion, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The intercontinental deal is expected to close in 90 days. The
buyers said they expected to achieve returns of 8.5% in the first
year after the transaction.</TE>
<TE>   Westfield, which would assume $936 million of Rodamco's existing
debt and pay the balance in cash, said it plans to raise about $1.2
billion to fund the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Simon Property closed up 44 cents at $29.78rmb Monday and Rouse
gained 2 cents to $28.75. Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. said engineers are working to fix a glitch in its Web
server that has prevented Windows XP users from downloading software
updates, including a patch for a new security hole.</LD>
<LD>   The problem, discovered Thursday, was created when engineers
attempted to update software on a server, a spokeswoman said, adding
that it is expected to be corrected before today.</LD>
<LD>   The news does not bode well for Windows XP users who are at risk
from two serious security holes announced last month that could leave
computers vulnerable to hacker attacks or a denial-of-service attack.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, an anti-virus company said a new computer worm
masquerading as a software update from Microsoft is capable of
deleting all files on the hard drive of an infected computer but has
so far spread very slowly.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called Gigger worm is a low threat because so few computers
have been infected, according to Network Associates Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The worm, a self-propagating virus, arrives as an attachment to an
e-mail that has a subject line of "Outlook Express Update."</TE>

<LD>Fannie Mae, the largest buyer of mortgages, said fourth-quarter
earnings rose 23% as homeowners refinanced loans at a record pace and
lower interest rates cut its cost of capital.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which is one of three government-sponsored
enterprises involved in the housing market, had a profit from
operations of $1.44 billion, or $1.40 a share, compared with net
income of $1.16 billion, or $1.12 a share, a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   For the year, the company earned $5.38 billion, its 15th year of
record earnings. Fannie Mae shares rose 95 cents to $79 on the NYSE.</LD>

<LD>The Treasury Department sold $13 billion in three-month bills at a
discount rate of 1.53%, down from 1.655% last week. An additional $13
billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 1.58%, down from
1.75%.</LD>
<LD>   The three-month rate was the lowest since Aug. 11, 1958, when the
bills sold for 1.524%. The six-month rate was the lowest since the
government began selling six-month bills in 1958.</LD>
<LD>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors--1.558% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,961.30 and 1.615% for a six-month bill selling for $9,920.10.</LD>
<TE>   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said that the average
yield for one-year constant maturity Treasury bills fell to 2.13%

<LD>The first Internet address suffixes created exclusively for

Operators of ".name" are hoping individuals will be lured by e-mail
and Web addresses featuring their own names.</LD>
<LD>   The London-based Global Name Registry, which in 2000 proposed and
won rights to administer the suffix, also is exploring expanding
".name" to mobile phones and other personal devices later this year.</LD>
<LD>   The Global Name Registry began allowing pre-registrations in
earnest last month for ".name" suffixes. For duplicate names
requested as of Dec. 17, one was selected at random. The first batch
of 60,000 names was to be activated today.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Supreme Court rejected Eli Lilly &amp; Co.'s appeal of a patent
ruling that allowed generic drug maker Barr Laboratories Inc. to sell
a version of the antidepressant Prozac.</LD>
<LD>   The justices let stand a U.S. appeals court ruling that resulted
in Lilly losing patent protection in August for Prozac, which in
recent years has boosted the company into the top 10 U.S. drug
makers.</LD>
<LD>   Barr, based in Pomona, N.Y., challenged the validity of Lilly's
Prozac patent in a long-running legal battle to allow generic
competition for the drug, which had sales of more than $2.5 billion
in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Lilly rose 60 cents to $77, while Barr Labs rose 44
cents to $78.31, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>AOL urged users of older versions of its ICQ instant-messaging
program to upgrade to the latest version because of a new security
hole that could leave computers vulnerable to hacking.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for Dulles, Va.-based AOL Time Warner Inc. said a bug
was found in the voice/video and games features in versions earlier
than version 2001b of ICQ, which was released in October.</LD>
<LD>   The problem results when the application is flooded with more code
than it can handle, triggering a so-called buffer overflow error and
allowing extraneous code to be executed. That could allow someone to
download malicious code onto a targeted computer.</LD>
<TE>   The newest version of ICQ can be downloaded from

<LD>Dollar General Corp. lowered earnings for fiscal 1998 through 2000 by
60 cents a share and said the Securities and Exchange Commission is
investigating accounting irregularities at the discount retailer.</LD>
<LD>   The company is cooperating with the SEC inquiry, Chief Financial
Officer James Hagan said. Hagan said he couldn't comment on whether
the company's own review uncovered evidence of fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Dollar General released its revised earnings after more than eight
months of review. In April the company said it would restate earnings
as it looked into "allegations of fraudulent behavior." The
announcement came two months after Chief Financial Officer Brian Burr
quit.</LD>
<TE>   In September, Dollar General fired its former auditor, Deloitte &amp;
Touche, over a disagreement on how leases should be treated for
accounting purposes.</TE>
<TE>   The company earned a combined $1.21 a share for fiscal 1998, 1999
and 2000 including the expense of settling lawsuits, Dollar General
said. That's lower than the combined $1.81 it previously disclosed
for the three years and less than the $1.74 a share it expected to
report when it began the re-examination in April.</TE>
<TE>   The restated profit was lower than originally forecast because
additional items were found in the accounting review and the company
settled more than 20 lawsuits resulting from the earnings
restatement, Dollar General said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Goodlettsville, Tenn.-based Dollar General fell 15 cents
to $16.09 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   The news was released after the close of regular U.S. trading.</TE>

<LD>The U.S. Treasury's inspector general cleared department officials of
wrongdoing in the premature release of the government's decision to
stop issuing 30-year bonds, according to an internal report.</LD>
<LD>   "This investigation did not develop any evidence of unauthorized
disclosure of market-sensitive information by Treasury employees,"
said the report, dated Jan. 2.</LD>
<LD>   It was obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request to
Treasury Inspector General Jeffrey Rush.</LD>
<TE>   Rush's inquiry is part of a wider investigation into Treasury's
surprise announcement Oct. 31 that it will stop issuing the 30-year
bond.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether
any laws were violated after the long bond had its biggest rally in
14 years in the minutes before the announcement.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Duke/Fluor Daniel, a venture of utility owner Duke Energy Corp. and
construction company Fluor Corp. in Aliso Viejo, will build three
natural gas-fueled power plants valued at $1.2 billion to boost
Duke's output in the Western U.S.</LD>
<LD>   A 1,200-megawatt plant will be built in Nevada, a 620-megawatt
facility in Washington and a 600-megawatt plant in New Mexico, the
companies said. The combined output would light about 1.8 million
average U.S. homes when the plants start operating in the third
quarter of 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Duke Energy North America, the electricity generating and trading
arm of Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke, will operate the plants. The
company is building gas-fired plants, which have lower construction
costs and pollute less than those fueled by oil and coal, to meet
expected growth in Western states.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Duke, the biggest U.S. utility owner, rose 26 cents to
$38.61. Fluor, the largest publicly traded engineering and
construction company, fell 41 cents to $35.19. Both stocks trade on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Miravant Medical Technologies shares sank 75% after the company said
its leading product, a drug to treat a major cause of blindness,
failed to work in a late-stage study.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Barbara-based Miravant is an unprofitable company that
specializes in light-activated drugs and has no other products ready
for the market. Its shares dropped $7.31 to $2.44 in Nasdaq trading
of 13.6 million shares, about 140 times the three-month daily
average. Miravant's decline was the biggest on U.S. markets.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a major setback for them--this was their most advanced
product," said Fariba Ghodsian, an analyst at Roth Capital Partners,
who holds no Miravant shares. She cut her rating on the stock to
"neutral" from "strong buy" on the news.</LD>
<TE>   The company will work with its partner, Pharmacia Corp., to
determine whether to continue to develop the drug, known as SnET2,
said Miravant spokeswoman Laurens Lichty.</TE>

<HD>Gotcha Surf Wear to Join 2nd Winkler Venture</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marvin Winkler is putting his Gotcha surf wear company under the
aegis of an interactive media company he helped found three years ago
and recently acquired, an executive for the operation said.</LD>
<LD>   Gotcha, which licenses the name to apparel makers worldwide, will
fall under the umbrella of Broadband Interactive Group, said Ian
Cairns, a former surfing champion who will step in today as BIG's
president.</LD>
<LD>   Privately held BIG, which was being liquidated when Winkler
acquired the assets, also owns the rights to Bluetorch Media, which
produces television and Web programs, and BIG Technologies, which is
developing interactive television technology. Winkler, chairman and
chief executive of Gotcha, will hold the same positions at BIG,
Cairns said.</LD>
<TE>   Winkler paid "pennies on the dollar" for assets valued at $8
million to acquire BIG and its divisions two months ago, Cairns said.
Winkler had helped start the company with funds that included more
than $10 million from Broadcom Corp. founders Henry T. Nicholas III
and Henry Samueli. BIG technology and Bluetorch television and
Webcast productions operate on Broadcom communications chip
technology.</TE>

<LD>In a sign of how times have changed, the name of Los Angeles-based
Wedbush Morgan Securities has been placed atop the 1000 Wilshire
Blvd. office building in downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The sign bearing the name of Wedbush, one of the region's largest
investment banks and brokerage firms, is scheduled to be dedicated
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Wedbush won the right to erect its name on the 22-story office
tower last year when it became the largest tenant at 1000 Wilshire by
leasing 113,000 of its 471,000 square feet.</LD>
<TE>   The building formerly housed the headquarters of Coast Federal
Savings, one of several banks and savings and loans that vacated
downtown buildings after buyouts and consolidations reduced their
need for office space.</TE>
<TE>   The Coast name is still visible atop 1000 Wilshire, where it is
etched in the building surface, but plans call for the former S&amp;L's
name to be removed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sony Music Entertainment, one of the five largest record companies in
the world, Monday announced its first licensing deal with an
independent company offering music by subscription online.</LD>
<LD>   The deal with San Francisco-based Listen.com makes Sony the last
of the five major labels to license its catalog to at least one
independent company selling digital music by subscription.</LD>
<LD>   Its announcement came four months after the Justice Department
stepped up its antitrust investigation of the labels' licensing
practices.</LD>
<TE>   Listen.com is adding Sony songs to its Rhapsody service, which
lets subscribers store and play an unlimited number of songs in a
personal online jukebox. The songs can't be downloaded, and they're
encrypted to deter users from copying or moving them to a portable
device.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Listen.com deal, the only subscription service offering
Sony's music was Pressplay, an online music distributor co-owned by
Sony and Universal Music Group. Listen charges $9.95 a month for
Rhapsody's music-on-demand service, which also includes songs from
EMI, BMG, the Naxos classical catalog and 46 independent labels.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Corning Inc., the largest maker of fiber-optic cable, said it will
take a $178-million fourth-quarter charge related to employee stock
holdings and said its pro forma net loss would be wider than
expected, although revenue is seen as being in line with
expectations.</LD>
<LD>   Corning expects to record a fourth-quarter charge of $90 million
related to the release of restrictions on Corning common stock held
by employees, a $60-million pre-tax charge to write off inventory in
the telecommunications segment and a $28-million write-off of an
intellectual property investment.</LD>
<LD>   The Corning, N.Y., firm expects a pro forma net loss per share of
28 to 29 cents, compared with its previous guidance of a loss of 20
to 25 cents a share. The company, which expects to report its
fourth-quarter results Jan. 23, expects sales for the fourth quarter
to be about $975 million.</LD>
<TE>   Corning shares fell 27 cents to close at $9.81 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As part of an ambitious campaign to show off its theme parks and
emerge from the shadow of Mickey Mouse, Universal Orlando will have
its first Super Bowl spot.</LD>
<LD>   With a "vacation from the ordinary" theme, the 60-second spot will
tout Universal's two Orlando theme parks and hotels. The ad is set to
run during the third quarter of the Super Bowl on Fox.</LD>
<LD>   The ad spot, which sources say will cost Universal $3 million, is
one in a series of national television ads that Universal will launch
this year in a bid to lure more visitors to Universal Orlando amid an
unprecedented tourism slowdown in Orlando since Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   Universal also is adopting a strategy similar to that of its arch
rival in Orlando, Walt Disney World, which for years has used
athletes from major sporting events to promote its theme parks in the
"What's Next?" campaigns.</TE>

<HD>Specialty Relocating to Valencia</HD>
<DH>The Santa Monica biomedical firm will build on 13.8 acres
it acquired from Newhall Land &amp; Farming.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB HOWARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Santa Monica-based biomedical firm, Specialty Laboratories Inc.,
will build a new headquarters in Valencia in one of two major real
estate developments announced last week by the Newhall Land &amp; Farming
Co.</LD>
<LD>   Specialty, which provides laboratory testing services for
hospitals and clinics, said it will build a three-story
200,000-square-foot combination laboratory and administrative
building on a 13.8-acre site that the company acquired from Newhall
Land.</LD>
<LD>   No groundbreaking date has been set, but the Santa Monica company
expects to begin soon and to complete the new facility by the summer
of 2003, said Fred Spina, Specialty's chief financial officer.</LD>
<TE>   Two floors of the building will be devoted to laboratory and
research operations and one floor to administration, according to
Spina. He said Specialty, which now operates in about 100,000 square
feet of leased space in a number of buildings in Santa Monica, needs
room to expand and consolidate.</TE>
<TE>   Specialty's new facility will be in Valencia Corporate Center, a
64-acre business park at the Interstate 5 Freeway and Valencia
Boulevard where a number of biomedical companies already have
facilities. Among them are Advanced Bionics and Allecure, both
founded by biomedical entrepreneur and philanthropist Alfred Mann, a
pioneer in developing and manufacturing such medical devices as heart
pacemakers and hearing implants.</TE>
<TE>   Although the amount of space occupied by biomedical firms in
Valencia is relatively small--about 500,000 square feet, broker Jim
Linn of Grubb &amp; Ellis said he expects that figure to grow because the
area's labor force, available land and quality of life appeal to that
industry.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't be surprised to see biomed grow faster than standard
office in the next four or five years" in Valencia, Linn said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Valencia may be best known as a residential neighborhood
and the home of Magic Mountain theme park, spokeswoman Marlee Lauffer
of Newhall Land said that the community has a fast-growing industrial
base and has attracted a number of office tenants that have corporate
headquarters there, including Princess Cruises and U.S. Borax.</TE>
<TE>   Office space in Valencia is about 1.5 million square feet and
industrial space about 18 million square feet, according to Lauffer,
who said Newhall Land is "very focused on developing the biomed
cluster," where Specialty Labs will locate.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Specialty nor Newhall Land disclosed the purchase price of
the company's 13.8 acres, but sources familiar with the deal said
Specialty paid about $8 million for the land. Publicly held Specialty
did not disclose construction costs for its new headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   In the other major real estate deal announced by Newhall and
reported in The Times last week, the nonprofit Packard Humanities
Institute of Los Altos bought 60 acres at McBean Parkway and Rockwell
Canyon Road that is the proposed new site of the UCLA Film and
Television Archive.</TE>
<TE>   Neither party disclosed the purchase price, but industry sources
said the institute paid about $12.5 million for the land.</TE>

<HD>Bond Outlook Upbeat Despite New Junk Ratings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ranks of corporate bonds rated "junk" continued to grow Monday,
but a leading credit-rating agency said it is sticking by its
prediction that actual bond defaults by companies will decline this
year.</LD>
<LD>   Moody's Investors Service downgraded the bonds of two Las
Vegas-based gambling giants--Park Place Entertainment Corp. and MGM
Mirage Inc.--to junk status, or below investment grade.</LD>
<LD>   Moody's said the downgrade to Ba1 for both firms reflected
expectations that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks probably will keep
many gamblers away from casinos "for some period of time."</LD>
<TE>   Also Monday, Moody's said it cut retailer Gap Inc.'s debt rating
to the lowest investment-grade level, and warned it may be reduced to
junk status because of the chain's weak sales picture.</TE>
<TE>   But Moody's issued a more upbeat report on corporate bonds
overall: The ratings agency said that bond defaults by companies more
than doubled last year to record levels. But it said the junk-bond
default rate should fall to 7.2% of outstanding bonds this year from
10.2% last year.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's and other rating agencies downgrade
bond ratings when they believe a company may have a tougher time
paying its bills. However, a downgrade, even to junk status, doesn't
mean a default is likely. Indeed, most companies whose bonds are
listed as junk continue to make their interest payments.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a ratings downgrade can worsen a company's financial
situation because investors typically demand that lower-rated firms
pay more to borrow, to compensate for higher risk.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's said 253 companies worldwide, including Enron Corp.,
Finova Capital Corp. and PG&amp;E Corp.'s main utility unit, defaulted on
$110.2 billion of bonds last year, compared with 167 companies
defaulting on $49.2 billion in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In downgrading Park Place and MGM Mirage on Monday, Moody's
pointed to concern that Las Vegas and other gambling centers won't
see a fast recovery in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Gambling revenue in Nevada fell 7.5% in November from a year ago,
according to a state report released Friday, because fewer
high-rollers visited Las Vegas to play baccarat, a game favored by
those who wager large sums of money.</TE>
<TE>   "The international high-roller has been in hibernation," said ABN
Amro analyst Joseph Greff. MGM Mirage owns such properties as
Bellagio and the MGM Grand; Park Place owns Bally's and Caesars
Palace, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Park Place shares fell 24 cents to $9.50 and MGM Mirage dropped 94
cents to $28.85, both on the New York Stock Exchange. That was before
Moody's made its announcement, which came after the close of trading.</TE>
<TE>   As for Gap, Moody's said the struggling chain may need to scale
back 2002 expansion plans to protect its finances.</TE>
<TE>   Gap shares were off 23 cents to $15.55 on the NYSE before Moody's
announcement.</TE>

<HD>WTO Disallows U.S. Tax Breaks</HD>
<DH>Trade: Backing European view, the agency rules against
sheltering of income from foreign sales. American firms could face up
to $4 billion in duties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN IRITANI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The World Trade Organization ruled on Monday that a tax break for
U.S. exporters was illegal, opening the door for Europe to impose as
much as $4 billion in duties on U.S. exports as punishment.</LD>
<LD>   Unless the United States repeals or amends its tax code, it could
face a bitter trade war with its European allies as well as the
largest penalty imposed in the six years that the Geneva-based WTO
has been regulating commerce. A WTO panel is scheduled to meet in
late March to finalize the duties and to decide which exports will be
targeted. The list could include airplanes, chemicals, toys and food.</LD>
<LD>   Relations between the United States and Europe were already
strained over threatened U.S. penalties on steel imported from Europe
and elsewhere. Given the financial stakes and the fragile state of
the global economy, many officials say they expect the U.S. and
Europe to craft a face-saving compromise that will avoid a costly
trade war.</LD>
<TE>   "The timing is very unfortunate because the companies most hurt by
this are in the industrial sector, and we're in the midst of the
worst industrial recession since at least 1980-81," said Tom
Duesterberg, president of the Manufacturer's Alliance, a Washington
trade group representing 450 U.S. firms.</TE>
<TE>   Under U.S. law, U.S. firms, such as Eastman Kodak Co. and the
Boeing Co., exempt up to 30% of their export income from taxation.
Europeans argued that the law represents an illegal subsidy since it
gives U.S. companies an edge. The U.S., which frequently argues that
foreign countries illegally subsidize their companies, contended the
U.S. tax rebates are legal.</TE>
<TE>   After Monday's ruling was announced, EU Trade Commissioner Pascal
Lamy said it was "up to the U.S. to comply with the WTO's findings."</TE>
<TE>   In a conciliatory response, U.S. Trade Representative Robert
Zoellick said he would "cooperate with the EU in order to manage and
resolve this dispute" and would consult with Congress and affected
companies about how to respond.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Hufbauer, a trade expert at the Institute for International
Economics, said the EU hopes to use the favorable ruling to gain more
leverage in the steel dispute and the newly launched global trade
talks where its farm policies are under attack.</TE>
<TE>   "They will threaten retaliation in order to get more value for
their chips," he said of the EU.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and Europe have been fighting over tax policy for
decades. The latest chapter can be traced to 1971, when Congress
created the Foreign Sales Corporation program so ailing U.S.
corporations could keep their overseas profits outside the country
and safe from some taxation.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the WTO upheld an EU complaint about the FSC program and
the U.S. agreed to amend the law. But the Europeans opposed the new
version and filed another complaint leading to Monday's decision.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. firms contend that the FSC program puts them on a more equal
footing with their European competitors. They claim the EU provides
benefits to its exporters in other ways, including a rebate of the
value-added tax, a type of consumption tax common in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Clemons, vice president of the Washington-based New
American Foundation, said the WTO ruling places U.S. multinationals
in a difficult spot because their insistence on the tax credit
threatens the credibility of the global system they championed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's awkward for these companies because they were at the
forefront in the fight to create the WTO, and now they are saying
this is an unjust dispute," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, Monday's decision added another wrinkle to the
ongoing debate on tax reform. California Rep. William M. Thomas
(R-Bakersfield), chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, has
urged the U.S. to adopt a territorial system similar to Europe's,
where domestic profits are taxed and foreign earnings are largely off
limits. But Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chair of the Senate Finance
Committee, said the U.S. should not cave in to European pressure and
should instead push the WTO to "preserve the sovereign right of each
country to set its own tax policy."</TE>

<HD>Dent Is Davis Cup Commodity</HD>

<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>Call it an arms race.</LD>
<LD>   The twin tattoos give away an intriguing, ongoing national tug of
war over prospect Taylor Dent.</LD>
<LD>   The hard-serving 20-year-old from Newport Beach has images on his
arm of the U.S. flag and an Australian flag, representing,
respectively, his native country and the nation of his father Phil,
who reached the Australian Open final in 1974.</LD>
<TE>   Australian Davis Cup captain John Fitzgerald is on record as
saying he would like Dent to play for Australia, someday. Phil Dent
once approached Tennis Australia, looking for support for his son.
And U.S. Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe said Monday he is
considering Dent to play in the first-round match against Slovakia
next month at Oklahoma City.</TE>
<TE>   It may come down to the fastest-moving country and brings forth
another question: When was the last time the United States and
Australia fought over anything?</TE>
<TE>   Two things have helped Dent at the Australian Open. In his
main-draw debut here Monday, he was dominating in a 6-2, 6-1, 6-2
victory against Michal Tabara of the Czech Republic. Today, another
potential Davis Cup contender, Jan-Michael Gambill, went out in the
first round against 30-year-old Wayne Ferreira of South Africa.
Gambill, who lost, 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 (6), has never won a singles match
in five appearances at the Australian Open.</TE>
<TE>   Another player in the U.S. equation came through with an upset.
James Blake, also making his main-draw debut, defeated 14th-seeded
Alex Corretja of Spain, 5-7, 7-6 (6), 6-3, 6-2, in 2 hours 51 minutes
Monday. Blake has played Davis Cup for the U.S., winning his singles
matches in the relegation round against India last year.</TE>
<TE>   Dent is cagey about the issue of Davis Cup representation, leaving
his options open. While one might assume that he would automatically
play for the U.S., he is unpredictable. He split from his father as
coach last year, realizing it was straining their relationship. More
recently, he parted, amicably, with respected Eliot Teltscher.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Dent is coaching himself, an unusual move. It is just as
conceivable he could join Australia, which is lacking substantial
depth after Lleyton Hewitt and Mark Philippoussis.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really heading toward leaving it in the future," Dent said.
"I just haven't made up my mind. I want to be a steady singles
player. You never know what happens and what works out. The more
options you have, the better off you are. I'm sure everybody knows
where I stand."</TE>
<TE>   Dent, smiling, mocked himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Hyped up, 120 in the world, that's all I have to say," he said,
joking. "It is flattering, but I still have to be levelheaded. I have
to get healthy and play some ball."</TE>
<TE>   Several other criteria would have to be met, according to
International Tennis Federation rules. If Dent were to want to play
for Australia, he would need a valid passport, and there is a loose
residency requirement. Additionally, officials are required to submit
an application to the ITF six months in advance of a match.</TE>

<HD>A Sampras Curve</HD>
<DH>Australian Open: Split with sponsor leaves him heated, even
as he wins first-round match.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>Relationships have a way of ending, and this breakup was particularly
bitter.</LD>
<LD>   One partner was still clinging to the illusion everything remained
the same, keeping his larger-than-life picture prominently displayed.</LD>
<LD>   The other made a visible statement that it was over, wearing a
patch of the American flag in the same spots that once represented
the relationship.</LD>
<TE>   Why try to maintain the fiction?</TE>
<TE>   Pete Sampras and his record 13 Grand Slam singles titles were
ready to go it alone ... without Nike. Ordinarily, this would be a
footnote after a routine first-round victory. Sampras looked sharp in
defeating Jarkko Nieminen of Finland, 6-3, 6-3, 6-4, today at the
Australian Open, serving 13 aces. But Sampras and Nike were together
for eight years, and the recent split is representative of the path
of change he has taken since the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Paul Annacone is gone, replaced by Tom Gullikson. Manager
Jeff Schwartz no longer handles his day-to-day affairs. Instead, Jill
Smoller, from the same company as Schwartz, is the agent of record.
And Nike is history, erased by the American flag and a Laker cap.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the company prominently featured Sampras in advertisements
in downtown Melbourne. Sampras didn't just make a statement about the
change on the court. Anyone who ever called him bland and cautious
should have listened to him here. Sampras, at 30, might as well shoot
from the hip if he feels strongly enough.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day you have to feel good about the deals that
you do, and as regards to Nike, I don't," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Later, in the hallway, he elaborated. The agreement expired in
January, and Sampras indicated the new offer was not as lucrative as
the last deal.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't show me respect," Sampras said.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras has been clear about looking for inspiration, which is one
of the reasons he decided late last year to play Davis Cup again for
the United States. Even the negativity of the Nike breakup can serve
as some form of motivation, as he makes a final charge for another
Grand Slam title.</TE>
<TE>   "I have really stepped it up and told myself I am going to give it
one really, really hard push," Sampras said. "In these last three
months, I have been training hard, doing a lot of running and lifting
and doing whatever I can to get in the best shape possible.</TE>
<TE>   "When you hit 30--I've been told by other athletes that is when
you need to work twice as hard and you need to push it."</TE>
<TE>   One potential obstacle in the way of Sampras' third Australian
Open title, Andre Agassi, was eliminated before the tournament
started because of an injured right wrist.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi and Sampras could have met in the quarterfinals. Another
threat, top-seeded Lleyton Hewitt of Australia, a potential opponent
in the semifinals, was locked today in a tight first-round match with
Alberto Martin of Spain. Hewitt split the first two sets with Martin
and lost the third, 6-4, as this edition went to press.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion and top-seeded Jennifer Capriati had a much
easier time. Capriati defeated Silvija Talaja of Croatia, 6-4, 6-1,
in 62 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati, who has been hurting, had her right thigh wrapped as a
precaution but felt she moved well on the court.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati's compelling comeback story--resulting in her first Grand
Slam title at this event last year--had something of a dreamlike
quality. So, as she arrived in Melbourne to defend her title,
Capriati actually dreamed about tennis for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe because I was so anxious to get on the court and play, and
I was just hoping that everything was going to go well and be OK,"
she said. "Maybe it was telling me in my dreams."</TE>
<TE>   Did she win in the dream?</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Capriati said.</TE>

<HD>Selig, Owners Still Have Contraction in Plans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN and ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With spring training four weeks away and the concept of eliminating
two teams this winter all but dead, Commissioner Bud Selig said
owners have urged him not to abandon the plan or the timetable.</LD>
<LD>   Owners are expected to approve the sales of the Boston Red Sox and
the Florida Marlins at a meeting this week in Phoenix. They are not
expected to withdraw or postpone plan to fold teams, although several
sources said Monday all 30 teams are likely to play this season, with
the possibility of dissolving teams in the future becoming a subject
of negotiations between owners and the players' union.</LD>
<LD>   A prominent agent assessed the likelihood of eliminating teams
this winter thusly: "I don't even see a 1% chance."</LD>
<TE>   The Montreal Expos and Minnesota Twins are believed to be targeted
for dissolution. With the elimination of teams on hold pending the
resolution of a court case in Minnesota and a union grievance, Selig
refused to say February was too late to implement the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "I still want to see how it plays out for a while," he said. "Is
it perfect? No. Is it the kind of scenario we'd like? No. But if
everything gets cleared away in February, it's not too late to do
it."</TE>
<TE>   Is it inconvenient? Yes. Would it cause some problems? Yes. But
can we live with it? Yes. The owners are urging me to continue to try
and do it for 2002."</TE>
<TE>   The logistics of disbanding two teams on the cusp of spring
training, dispersing players, drawing up new schedules and shuffling
minor league rosters would be complicated at best.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Selig issued an unprecedented invitation for union
chief Donald Fehr to address owners during Thursday's meeting. Fehr
accepted.</TE>
<TE>   Selig last week proposed that players approve expanded revenue
sharing and a dollar-for-dollar tax on each team payroll above $98
million.</TE>
<TE>   The embattled Selig, embroiled anew in controversy after last
week's revelation that a company run by Minnesota owner Carl Pohlad
loaned his Milwaukee Brewers money without the disclosure required by
major league rules, acknowledged that he played a role in the sale of
the Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Massachusetts Atty. Gen. Thomas Reilly has charged that baseball
officials "called the shots" in the sale of the team to a group led
by Florida Marlin owner John Henry, former San Diego Padre owner Tom
Werner and former Padre and Baltimore Oriole president Larry
Lucchino.</TE>
<TE>   By accepting a $700-million offer from that group, and by
rejecting higher bids from cable television magnate Charles Dolan and
a group led by New York attorney Miles Prentice, Reilly said the
trust controlling a majority interest in the team left millions on
the table that could have gone to charities.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox said Prentice's financing was not secured. And, after
Dolan made a new bid of $740 million Friday, Red Sox chief John
Harrington issued an unusually harsh statement Sunday in which he
said "enough is enough." The bidding was closed, Harrington said.
Dolan responded with a $790 million offer late Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "No commissioner in any sport would ever not play a role in
selecting ownership," Selig said. "There is nothing aberrational
here. We knew John Henry. We know Tom Werner, and Larry Lucchino
going there was very attractive to us."</TE>
<TE>   While the Henry group is expected to gain easy approval this week,
allowing the outgoing owners and charitable trust to cash in very
soon, Selig insisted his office approved of--but did not dictate--the
sale to the Henry group.</TE>
<TE>   "John Harrington's organization conducted the bidding on its own,"
Selig said. "We all wanted to get it to the approval process as soon
as possible."</TE>

<HD>Bonds Goes Deep on New Contract</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Outfielder, the season home run king, signs
five-year, $90-million deal with the Giants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moments after hitting the 500th home run of his career, Barry Bonds
stood behind home plate at Pacific Bell Park with a microphone in his
hand. Seen as surly in most corners, the San Francisco Giant left
fielder surprised many with his graciousness.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds showed gratitude for the fans.</LD>
<LD>   "I love you," he said on that cool April evening, "and I'm proud
to be in a San Francisco Giant uniform."</LD>
<TE>   Apparently so.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, 37, and the Giants agreed Monday night on a five-year,
$90-million contract that will most likely keep him in a San
Francisco uniform the remainder of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "Barry Bonds is obviously one of the premier players to ever play
the game," Giant General Manager Brian Sabean said in a team release.
"His personal accomplishments speak for themselves, but even more
importantly, he is such a vital element to our club's success. We are
delighted that both sides could come to an agreement and can move
forward on our mutual goals of winning a championship."</TE>
<TE>   After a spring training of discontent--Bonds was irked that the
Giants had not locked him to a long-term deal--he took out his
aggression on opposing pitchers in his "walk" year.</TE>
<TE>   Besides hitting his 500th career homer, Bonds set the season home
run mark with 73, eclipsing Mark McGwire's three-year-old record of
70.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, who ranks seventh on the all-time home run list with 567,
also had an .863 slugging percentage and 177 bases on balls, breaking
season records set by Babe Ruth.</TE>
<TE>   His on-base percentage of .515 was the highest by a National
League player in the modern era and he batted .328 with 137 runs
batted in.</TE>
<TE>   For his efforts, Bonds won an unprecedented fourth NL most
valuable player award.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time Barry Bonds retires as a player, he will be
acknowledged as one of the finest, possibly even the finest, ever to
play the game," said Peter Magowan, the Giants' managing general
partner. "I believe he has a decent shot at [Hank] Aaron's home run
record [of 755]. He could also achieve the all-time records for runs
scored and walks, and have over 3,000 hits."</TE>
<TE>   The deal, which includes a $10-million signing bonus to be paid
through April 2004, also calls for a 10-year personal services
contract after his playing career is over.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' salary for the next two seasons is $13 million before
jumping to $16 million in 2004, $20 million in 2005 and $18 million
in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   The average annual salary of $18 million ties Bonds with Chicago
Cub right fielder Sammy Sosa for the fourth-highest in baseball,
behind Texas Ranger shortstop Alex Rodriguez ($25.2 million), Boston
Red Sox outfielder Manny Ramirez ($20 million) and New York Yankee
shortstop Derek Jeter ($18.9 million).</TE>
<TE>   Only the first four years and $72 million are guaranteed, though.</TE>
<TE>   Should Bonds not get at least 500 plate appearances in 2005, the
Giants can void the final year of the contract.</TE>
<TE>   But if Bonds has at least 1,500 plate appearances from 2003 to
2005, including 400 or more in the final year, the last season
becomes guaranteed.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, a 16-year veteran who joined the Giants as a free agent on
Dec. 8, 1992, has a no-trade clause and again became a free agent
after last season.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants, though, were the only team to acknowledge making a bid
and, after accepting San Francisco's offer of salary arbitration on
Dec. 20, Bonds and the team were set to exchange proposed salaries
Friday for a one-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   "It's rare these days that players play more than 10 years with a
team, even franchise players," Magowan said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are delighted to have the best player in the game today."</TE>

<KH>CHICK HEARN PLOTS HIS RETURN</KH>
<HD>'I Wish I Was Going Back Tonight'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The voice is almost as good as new, and so is the heart. Chick Hearn
is eager to go back to work.</LD>
<LD>   "I wish I was going back tonight," Hearn said Monday, referring to
the Lakers' game against the Memphis Grizzlies.</LD>
<LD>   In his first in-depth interview since his open-heart surgery Dec.
19, Hearn said he hopes to be back in early February.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers' first February home game is Feb. 6 against the Chicago
Bulls. Their next game is Feb. 12 at home against the Washington
Wizards.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn, the only play-by-play announcer the Lakers had had in 42
years in Los Angeles, had worked 3,338 consecutive games over a
36-year span when he had the surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "I really never gave the streak much thought," he said. "What did
it last, 36 years? It was a case where I would just automatically go
work.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll just have to start on a new streak."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn, who turned 85 Nov. 27, said he plans to be back next season
as well, announcing every game, home and away. "I want to work every
game," he said. "That's just the way I am. The travel doesn't bother
me, and before the surgery I felt pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Since the surgery, Hearn has had time to reflect.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of things can happen in one's life, and it teaches you to
be grateful for everything you have.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole experience has made me love my job more than ever.
What I've missed the most is being around the players and coaches and
everyone else. And not just the Laker players and coaches, but those
from the visiting teams as well."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn said he and his wife Marge have been overwhelmed by the
get-well wishes they have received.</TE>
<TE>   "There are thousands and thousands and thousands of cards and
letters," he said. "I don't know if we'll get to all of them, but
we're going to try.</TE>
<TE>   "We were reading them last night as we were watching television.
They are so heart-warming. And so appreciated, I just can't tell you.</TE>
<TE>   "Some cards come from schools where a whole class has signed the
card."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn paused to chuckle.</TE>
<TE>   "One little girl, a second-grader, wrote, 'Dear Chick, I hope you
don't die.'"</TE>
<TE>   And speaking of the media coverage of his surgery, the kind
usually accorded famous people only when they die, Hearn said, "Maybe
they thought I did die."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn said he has been watching games, but with the sound down.</TE>
<TE>   "I call the game as I sit here," he said. "Not with the same
emphasis as I would if I were doing it for real. I do it to keep me
in shape."</TE>
<TE>   He said he has been progressing gradually, although there have
been days when he felt weak.</TE>
<TE>   His main concern was his voice. Because he'd had tubes down his
throat, he had trouble talking for quite a while.</TE>
<TE>   "The voice has come back pretty good," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn said he doesn't remember much about the day of his surgery,
but that he felt very tired and weak.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember telling Marge we'd better get to the hospital,"
hesaid.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't remember going to the hospital, and I don't remember the
preparation [for surgery].</TE>
<TE>   "I just remember waking up and thinking, 'It's over.'"</TE>
<TE>   Hearn had a damaged valve replaced.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was going stir crazy during his week-long stay at
Northridge Hospital Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt so confined," he said. "But the nurses and the people who
took care of me were great. They made it bearable."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn also was grateful to his cardiologist, Jack Patterson, and
surgeon Michael Soltero.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thrilled with the encouragement they've given me," he said.
"And I can't say enough about everyone in the Laker
organization--Jerry Buss and Jeanie [Buss] and Mitch [Kupchak, the
general manager]."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn also felt like talking a little basketball. He had seen
Shaquille O'Neal take a swing at the Bulls' Brad Miller on Saturday
night.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a very unfortunate incident," he said. "I've said many
times on the air that I don't understand how he holds his temper.
Well, there was a case where he finally didn't."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were leading by 17 in the second quarter Saturday
night, but that lead had evaporated by halftime, when Hearn went on
the air briefly by phone during Channel 9's telecast.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Lakers lose, they shouldn't come home," Hearn told
announcers Paul Sunderland and Stu Lantz.</TE>
<TE>   "It was typical Chick," Sunderland said Monday. "I was glad our
viewers got a chance to hear his voice."</TE>
<TE>   Sunderland has been doing a nice job filling in for Hearn but
readily acknowledges he's just keeping the seat warm.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great that Chick is coming back according to the original
schedule," Sunderland said when told of Hearn's target dates. "He was
supposed to miss six to eight weeks, and it looks like that's just
about what it will be."</TE>
<TE>   Whether Hearn returns for the game against the Bulls, which would
be fitting considering all that went on in Chicago on Saturday, or
for the game against Michael Jordan and the Wizards, it will be a
stirring occasion.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll be the loudest ovation in Staples Center history,"
Sunderland said.</TE>

<DH>Pro football: Redskins fire Schottenheimer, hire Spurrier;
Dungy out, Parcells on way in at Tampa.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a pair of developments Monday illustrating the volatility of
coaching in the NFL, the Washington Redskins replaced Coach Marty
Schottenheimer with Steve Spurrier; and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
dumped Coach Tony Dungy, paving the way to hire Bill Parcells.</LD>
<LD>   The firings underscore the pressure league owners feel to win, and
win now. Most are long on money, short on patience. Spurrier will
receive a reported five-year, $25-million deal--the richest in league
history--and Schottenheimer, who had four years remaining on his
contract, gets a buyout of $7.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   Dungy, the most successful coach in Tampa Bay history, was fired
late Monday after a meeting with the sons of team owner Malcolm
Glazer. Dungy compiled a 54-42 record in six seasons and led the
Buccaneers to the playoffs four of the last five seasons--including
this one.</LD>
<TE>   The Redskins pulled off an unprecedented comeback, starting 0-5
then winning five in a row. They finished 8-8, but that wasn't good
enough to satisfy owner Daniel Snyder.</TE>
<TE>   "I have for many years understood that the owner is the owner and
this can occur at any point in time in this business," said
Schottenheimer, who was coach and general manager and went 8-8 in his
only season. "I'm disappointed that we didn't get a chance to finish.
But I understand exactly where Dan is coming from, and I respect
that."</TE>
<TE>   The Redskins will introduce Spurrier as their coach at a news
conference today. Tampa Bay is expected to announce the Parcells
hiring within days.</TE>
<TE>   Parcells won two Super Bowls as coach of the New York Giants. Then
again, two rings didn't save the job of Carolina's George Seifert,
fired last week. His team started 1-0 then lost 15 consecutive games,
an NFL-record collapse. Seifert won two Super Bowls as coach of the
San Francisco 49ers; the only other current coach with two rings is
Denver's Mike Shanahan.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be that three years was the magic number for
rebuilding plans, but it's not that way anymore," former NFL coach
Sam Wyche said. "The owners want results right away, and they look at
things a little differently than the fans.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be if you won 10 games you had a great year. That's
not the case anymore. The stakes have gone up."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the stakes are as high as Spurrier's ego is large.
The Redskins intend to hire a general manager--maybe Bobby Beathard,
a key player-personnel executive from their most recent salad
days--and leave the coaching to Spurrier, the former Heisman Trophy
winner who coached his alma mater to a 122-27-1 record. His only
professional coaching experience was three seasons with the Tampa Bay
Bandits before the United States Football League folded.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier was an NFL quarterback from 1967 through '76, including
nine seasons as a backup in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the kind of guy that would probably drive a coach crazy
because he always had a better idea," said Len Rohde, a 49er tackle
from 1960 through '74.</TE>
<TE>   "When he was on the bench, he had this very detached way about
him. Very casual. He developed this technique of bouncing the
football on the ground and having it come back to him. Little tricks
to occupy himself like he didn't care what was happening on the
field. But when he got in the game, he was a whole different guy.
Very intense."</TE>
<TE>   As Florida's coach, Spurrier was wildly successful, even though he
seemed to spend more time on the golf course than in the film room.
He routinely poked fun at opponents, once referring to Florida State
as "Free Shoes University" in the wake of a Foot Locker buying
scandal, and another time saying of a dormitory fire at Auburn: "It's
a shame, because half the books weren't colored in yet."</TE>
<TE>   He resigned abruptly from Florida on Jan. 4 . In his final news
conference, he was asked if coaching in the NFL will require longer
hours.</TE>
<TE>   "That Jim Haze-lett," he said, butchering the name of New Orleans
Saint Coach Jim Haslett, "I read where he goes in at 4:30 in the
morning. Hasn't helped him much."</TE>
<TE>   Like Spurrier, Parcells has a larger-than-life perception of
himself. But Parcells also has the NFL dossier to back it up. He
coached the Giants to two Super Bowl titles, reached another Super
Bowl as coach of the New England Patriots, and turned the 1-15 New
York Jets into AFC East champions in two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Parcells' best friends are Al Davis and Bob Knight--with
whom he shared an apartment when the two were young coaches at West
Point. It has been pointed out that the three have similar people
skills.</TE>
<TE>   After Tampa Bay's season ended Saturday with a 31-9 loss at
Philadelphia, receiver Keyshawn Johnson angrily criticized teammates
(without naming them), and made reference to Parcells, his coach with
the Jets.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy they're talking about coming in, he ain't going to put up
with this.... Period," Johnson said. "He ain't going to put up with
it. If that's the truth, if he's coming here, he ain't going to put
up with it."</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, shortly after Parcells took over as coach of the Jets, he
called Johnson "fat," sarcastically referred to 300-pound linebacker
Mo Lewis as a "hunk of burning love," and told running back Adrian
Murrell he had a "chicken neck."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson promptly shaved 10 pounds, Lewis dropped 40, and Murrell
altered his weightlifting program to concentrate on his KFC body
parts.</TE>
<TE>   Before that, Parcells caused a stir in New England when he
derisively referred to rookie receiver Terry Glenn as "she." The
coach wanted to draft a defensive lineman instead of Glenn but lost
that argument to Patriot owner Bob Kraft. So when Glenn sustained an
injury in training camp and a reporter asked about his condition,
Parcells said: "She's doing OK."</TE>
<TE>   That infuriated plenty of people, including Kraft's wife. Parcells
got the message and later frequently praised Glenn, who emerged as
the team's best receiver.</TE>
<TE>   Those who know Parcells well say he's always up for a challenge.
He likes to bring up the story of two salesmen who venture into the
Australian outback to peddle shoes. The first calls his boss and
says, "There's no opportunity here. The people don't wear shoes." The
second calls his boss and says, "The opportunities here are endless.
The people don't wear shoes."</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, NFL owners are willing to shell out a mountain of
money for the right shoe salesman. It wasn't always that way.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no regard for money anymore," said former coach Jerry
Glanville, now a CBS analyst. "The owners I worked for cherished
their money. There were no buyouts.</TE>
<TE>   "One time, I told my owner, 'We go to the playoffs every year, and
we win a playoff game on the road every year. And I'm the lowest-paid
coach in the league.'"</TE>
<TE>   Hearing that, the owner's son-in-law popped to his feet and
slapped the desk, saying, "And we're damn proud of it!"</TE>

<LD>With only a few days to go before the Mighty Ducks travel to Calgary
to face the Flames on Saturday in what is expected to be Brawl Night
II, Anaheim traded away seldom-used enforcer Jim Cummins to the New
York Islanders on Monday in exchange for center Dave Roche.</LD>
<LD>   Cummins, who appeared in only two games this season with the
Ducks, had been playing for Cincinnati of the American Hockey League,
where he had five points and 39 penalty minutes in 11 games.</LD>
<LD>   Roche, a 6-foot-4, 230-pound veteran, has played in 171 NHL games
with 30 points and 334 penalty minutes. He had been an offensive
force this season playing for the Bridgeport Sound of the AHL, where
he led the team with 22 goals. Roche is expected to report to
Cincinnati of the AHL today.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the fourth consecutive game, Coach Bryan Murray skated Paul
Kariya with Andy McDonald and Patric Kjellberg when the Ducks faced
Nashville on Monday night at the Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a guy like Kjellberg with that group because of his
ability to play in front of the net," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   With Kjellberg playing on the No.1 line, the Ducks are able to
skate Marty McInnis on Samuel Pahlsson's line and still use him at
the point on the power play.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran right wing Sergei Krivokrasov, who has been a healthy
scratch for 13 of the last 14 games, has been assigned to Cincinnati
pending that he clears waivers.</TE>

<HD>Kariya Finds the Net, Ducks Get the Victory</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Anaheim captain records his first hat trick this
season in 5-3 win at home over Nashville.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It might have been a horrible night for ticket scalpers outside the
Arrowhead Pond on Monday but you won't hear any complaints from Paul
Kariya and the Mighty Ducks, who certainly enjoyed themselves inside
against the Nashville Predators.</LD>
<LD>   Kariya scored three goals for his sixth career hat trick and first
this season to lead the Ducks to a 5-3 victory over Nashville in
front of an announced crowd of 9,522, the third-smallest home crowd
in franchise history.</LD>
<LD>   Kariya, who has had problems finding the net this season, scored
two goals in the first period and one in the second to help the Ducks
end an eight-game winless streak. Anaheim, which improved to
14-25-6-3, had not won since a 2-1 victory at San Jose on Dec. 26.</LD>
<TE>   "What it basically amounts to is that we have needed one more goal
a game," Anaheim Coach Bryan Murray said. "Not every game but a lot
of games, when we score three goals we have a pretty good chance to
win."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks entered Monday's game 26th out of 30 teams in goals with
99.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why we keep searching, looking, hoping and working to get
that other goal," Murray said. "It's a group thing that everyone has
to be a part of."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Kariya fixed that problem all by himself with the 49th
multi-goal game of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul is one of the best players in the world and it's great to
see him finally [have a big game]," said winger Marty McInnis, who
scored his ninth goal of the season in the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim goaltender Jean-Sebastien Giguere, who had a 1.91
goals-against average and a .921 save percentage in 13 home games
before Monday, made 16 saves to win his ninth this season.</TE>
<TE>   After losing, 2-1, at Nashville on Saturday, the Ducks got off to
a strong start against the Predators on Monday. McInnis scored the
first goal when his shot from the left circle deflected off Nashville
center Greg Johnson's skate past goaltender Mike Dunham to give
Anaheim a 1-0 lead 6:38 into the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Kariya joined the fun with his first goal of the night at 13:31
when he gathered in a drop pass from defenseman Niclas Havelid and
blasted a shot from the top of the right circle to give the Ducks a
2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Before the period ended, Kariya added another goal when he scored
on a four-on-four situation off a great assist from Mike Leclerc at
18:26, to extend the Ducks' lead to three.</TE>
<TE>   Nashville cut the deficit to 3-1 when left wing Martin Erat scored
1:03 into the second period off a four-on-two rush by the Predators.
That set the stage for Kariya.</TE>
<TE>   Skating on a line with Matt Cullen and Leclerc, Kariya scored his
third goal of the game and his 17th of the season at 11:19 of the
second period when he knocked in a rebound past backup goalie Tomas
Vokoun, who had replaced Dunham at the start of the second.</TE>
<TE>   The goal gave Kariya his first hat trick since March 29, 2001 at
San Jose and his first at home since Feb. 19, 2001 when he scored
three times against Calgary.</TE>
<TE>   The Predators, who dropped to 1-5-1 at the Arrowhead Pond and
5-15-2-0 on the road this season, made the game close with a late
second-period goal from Cliff Ronning, who scored from outside the
blue line, and an early third-period score by Kimmo Timonen.</TE>
<TE>   But the Ducks finished the scoring when Cullen scored an empty-net
goal for his 10th of the season with 33.6 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Former Duck Petr Tenkrat, who scored the winning goal for the
Predators Saturday, did not score Monday. Anaheim's Jeff Friesen did
not play after the second period because of an ankle injury.</TE>

<LD>While warming up before a game, six balls go through the basket, one
after another, all originating from beyond the three-point arc. It's
the Ventura Cougars and this is largely what they do.</LD>
<LD>   Shoot three-point baskets. A lot of them.</LD>
<LD>   Last season, Ventura made 236 three-point baskets, which exceeded
the existing Southern Section record of 218 shared by La Crescenta
Crescenta Valley (1995-96) and Chino Hills Ayala (1997-98).</LD>
<TE>   "I inherited a team last year that was set, that had no size, not
outstanding quickness, but two or three good shooters, so I said,
'Let's find a strength and really work on it,'" said Ventura's
second-year coach, Ann Larson.</TE>
<TE>   It has worked. Last season, Ventura went 20-6, and this season the
Cougars are 15-2 and ranked No. 8 by The Times. Last week, they
throttled their rival, then-No. 6 Ventura Buena, 63-43, making seven
of 15 three-point baskets in the first three quarters to build a
56-31 lead. The Cougars finished eight of 23.</TE>
<TE>   It was an easy transition for Larson to spend the time on
shooting. She played for Buena Coach Joe Vaughan and was on his staff
12 years, two as a varsity assistant, 10 as a junior varsity coach.
Vaughan, Larson said, always placed a priority on shooting in
practice.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of people jump into drills," she said. "You have to
be patient, not get too much going on and just let the kids shoot."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura has attempted 480 two-point field goals (making 42.7%) and
481 three-point baskets, making 152 (31.6%). The overall shooting
percentage is 37.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Larson said she can't see this style becoming a Ventura trademark,
though.</TE>
<TE>   "Our guards are always going to shoot well," she said. "But as I
look down the road, there's some big kids coming in. I'm not going to
deny myself the use of a 6-foot player. You have to go with the
personnel you have and coach with what works best for you."</TE>
<TE>   In this year's lineup, only four players are as tall as 5-9 and
only one is as tall as 5-11. Two of the "giants" are freshmen, one's
a sophomore, and the other is senior Jenni Dooley. When she realized
that her team was changing its style to accommodate the shooters, it
immediately struck a chord with Dooley.</TE>
<TE>   "I was excited," she said. "I was always a shooter and thought it
would be fun. But you have to make it."</TE>
<TE>   Dooley has made more than most. She made 93 last season. She said
even when the Cougars aren't at the top of their game, they still
shoot "considerably well."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not very often," Dooley said, "that everybody's having an
off night."</TE>
<TE>   Senior guard Katy O'Brien, who is 5-6, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working with what we have," O'Brien said. "Shooting is what
we do, and we do it well."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Foothill League protest: Saugus Coach Eric Olsson is the subject
of a protest filed by Burbank Burroughs after Saugus scored a 62-45
victory Friday. Olsson drew a technical foul near the end of the
first quarter, then was ejected by officials. He went into the locker
room.</TE>
<TE>   Burroughs is alleging that Olsson coached the team while in the
locker room, a violation.</TE>
<TE>   According to Teri Lord, Saugus athletic director, Burroughs is
seeking a forfeiture.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Timing is everything: It could be argued that Fullerton Rosary has
the toughest regionally based schedule in the Southern Section. It
has played eight teams ranked in The Times' top 25, accounting for
all eight of its losses.</TE>
<TE>   The Royals don't have any starters back from last year's team,
have a leading scorer who is a sophomore, Cara Enright, and often
have two freshmen on the court, Karina Figueroa and Teresa Karcher.</TE>
<TE>   They opened Serra League play last Tuesday with a 48-35 victory
over then-No. 8 Santa Ana Mater Dei. Rosary outscored the Monarchs in
the second half, 21-8.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned how to be just as focused playing three tough games as
opposed to being good in just the first game," Rosary Coach Richard
Yoon said of the schedule. He hopes it will pay dividends in the
Division III-A playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Said Yoon: "Last year, we got better when we played a succession
of tough games."</TE>

<DL>LA QUINTA</DL>
<LD>The new-old Bob Hope Chrysler Classic begins its annual 90-hole
teardown of Indian Wells, Tamarisk and Bermuda Dunes on Wednesday, so
there's nothing new there. On the other hand, there are few new
wrinkles in the Hope.</LD>
<LD>   First--and this will be of utmost interest to the 128 pros in the
field--the prize money has been raised $600,000 to $4.1 million.</LD>
<LD>   Second, the tournament has been moved back to its normal
mid-January position on the PGA Tour calendar.</LD>
<TE>   Third, it's a better field than usual.</TE>
<TE>   And for that, you can count the presence of Phil Mickelson as the
primary reason, because he's usually not a part of the Hope--he has
played it only once since 1994. But Monday, there was Mickelson, out
on the Palmer Course with Curtis Strange, playing a practice round.</TE>
<TE>   The good news was no one had to show Mickelson how to hold a club,
always a possibility because he hasn't played an official tour event
since August.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Mickelson had his fifth multiple-victory season. He won
twice, had three top threes and earned a career high $4.4 million.
Although his record in majors still shows no victories, Mickelson
challenged in two. He was second to David Toms at the PGA
Championship and third at the Masters, where Tiger Woods won.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Woods isn't here because he never plays the Hope. But
Jerry Kelly is. Last week's winner of the Sony Open at Hawaii, Kelly
tried to practice Monday but had to give up because of fatigue.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Mickelson, some other important names in the field include
Toms, David Duval, Jesper Parnevik, Justin Leonard, Fred Couples,
John Daly, Steve Elkington, Mark Calcavecchia, Paul Azinger and
Arnold Palmer. Joe Durant is the defending champion and won $630,000
with a tour-record 36-under-par.</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, the Hope will serve as a coming-out party for
some of the younger players who are held in high regard, such as
Charles Howell III, Paul Casey and David Gossett.</TE>
<TE>   But there also are 37 new tour cardholders in the field, including
three-time Buy.com Tour winners Chad Campbell and Heath Slocum. It
also includes Boo Weekley, the 28-year-old from Milton, Fla., who
already is making a name for himself by playing in tennis shoes (to
protect his feet) and foul-weather pants (to help stop an itch).</TE>

<LD>Adam Mair, eligible to play for the Kings tonight after serving a
10-game suspension for leaving the bench last month during a fight,
was talking to reporters Monday about his return when teammate Kelly
Buchberger interrupted.</LD>
<LD>   "I lost a lot of money because I was dumb," the Kings' oldest
player instructed the rookie to say. "Don't forget to throw that in."</LD>
<LD>   Mair, 22, wouldn't go that far but he did say that it is unlikely
he will repeat his actions of Dec. 20, when he jumped off the bench
to join a brawl against the Ottawa Senators, earning an automatic
suspension from the league.</LD>
<TE>   "I would imagine that I would think twice about doing something
like that again in terms of [the repercussions]," he said. "But you
never know, in the heat of the moment, when you're playing and things
are happening fast.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a game of reactions. But it would have to be something very
extreme to see something like that again."</TE>
<TE>   Though he was ineligible to play, Mair took up a roster spot and
continued practicing with the Kings, even taking trips.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, it was frustrating.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been long," he said. "As a hockey player, you want to play
games. That's your job and that's what you love doing....</TE>
<TE>   "It's awesome to be back and to get an opportunity to play and do
all those things you take for granted when you're in the lineup all
the time."</TE>

<LD>While the NBA could take an evaluative look at Shaquille O'Neal's
various issues with its referees, Phil Jackson said Monday that he
doubts the rest of the league holds much sorrow for the 340-pound guy
with the jump hook.</LD>
<LD>   "Having gone through the reign of Michael Jordan," Jackson said,
"at the beginning of the season there'd be new rules to stop Michael.
It's the same thing with Shaq.</LD>
<LD>   "So, we anticipate there's not going to be a little sympathy.
We're the champions, he's the MVP player in the league, and everybody
would like to see his efficiency decrease, somewhat."</LD>
<TE>   Jackson suggested that three games off would aid in O'Neal's
recovery from a sore arthritic big toe, an ailment that flared again
during the road trip.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were 3-2 when O'Neal was on the injured list from Dec.
25 to Jan. 3. The toughest game in the next three is Saturday, when
the Lakers play at San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   "It puts us in a situation where it's a fat chance we might be
leading this conference by the All-Star break," Jackson said, then
added wryly, "which, of course, as you all know, is a thrill for me."</TE>
<TE>   If the Lakers had the best record, Jackson would be required to
coach the Western Conference All-Stars in Philadelphia on Feb. 10.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mitch Richmond was fined $5,000 on Monday for an obscene gesture
directed toward a fan in Detroit on Jan. 8. The incident occurred at
The Palace at Auburn Hills, late in the Lakers' 121-92 victory over
the Pistons.</TE>
<TE>   Richmond apologized publicly shortly afterward and did again in a
brief conversation with General Manager Mitch Kupchak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Bulls took exception to something Kobe Bryant said about
payback in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Kobe can say whatever the ... he wants," Charles Oakley said.
"Talk don't scare me. We're not going to back down. They put their
pants on the same way we do, unless they got two zippers."</TE>
<TE>   The Bulls come to Staples Center on Feb. 6, a day after a World
Wrestling Federation event on the same floor.</TE>

<HD>Shaq's Out; Kobe's Way In</HD>
<DH>Bryant Fills O'Neal Void With 56 Points in 120-81 Rout</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Forced to scrape through the first of three games without Shaquille
O'Neal on Monday night, Kobe Bryant scored a career-high 56 points.</LD>
<LD>   Playing in the wake of O'Neal's suspension, announced earlier in
the day, Bryant sucked the gravity out of Staples Center and scored
enough for both of them. He then did not play the fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers defeated the helpless Memphis Grizzlies, 120-81, in the
early part of a week they'll spend without O'Neal.</LD>
<TE>   After two days of talk of thuggery and loaded-up right hands,
Bryant scrawled "34," O'Neal's number, on his sneakers and then
flitted elegantly through a baffled defense.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, asked to give a message for O'Neal, Bryant leaned into
a radio microphone and said, "I love you, man."</TE>
<TE>   His 56 were the most points scored in the NBA this season.</TE>
<TE>   He made 21 of 34 field-goal attempts, including three of six from
the three-point arc. He had five rebounds, and time enough for four
assists, and left for good at the end of three quarters to a standing
ovation, therapy for a crowd of 18,997 that came in part to mourn
O'Neal's three-game suspension.</TE>
<TE>   Elgin Baylor's Laker record 71 points was safe only because the
Grizzlies, who had never allowed so many points to an individual,
even in four quarters, were not good enough to keep Bryant in the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a combination of emotions," Bryant said later. "I was
upset because we lost in Chicago, and two in a row. I was upset that
Shaq was suspended."</TE>
<TE>   In a team meeting early Monday, Bryant admitted that his game had
strayed, and promised his teammates that he would rework his into
theirs'.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make up for it tonight," Coach Phil Jackson recalled
him saying.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson chuckled.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he meant he was going to pass the ball," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It might have been the plan. Then, Bryant felt it, and everyone in
the place thought one thing: Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, my offensive aggressiveness can take them out of a
game," Bryant said. "I know that and they know that. I just let them
know, 'I'm here for you guys. I'm here for you."</TE>
<TE>   Turned out, they were there for him, urging him to shoot, setting
picks to open lanes, lobbing alley-oops.</TE>
<TE>   And, sometimes, getting the heck out of the way.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy created his own shots," said Samaki Walker, who started
at center for O'Neal. "I mean, he had four guys on him, away from the
basket guarding him at one point. To come down, do a different move
every time down the floor, there's no answer for that. I've never
seen anything like that before in my life."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant scored 36 points in Memphis on Dec. 21, the night he
strained his right ribs and could barely breathe in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   He was on his way to 50 that night, it seemed. More, maybe.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to lift his arms over his head, Bryant did not score after
the third quarter, and O'Neal was hindered by two bad feet, and the
Lakers lost by six points.</TE>
<TE>   Very healthy 31/2 weeks later, Bryant had 14 points in the first
quarter and 18 in the second. He reached halftime having made 14 of
22 attempts, and left the floor with a shout and hard high-fives for
Brian Shaw and Lindsey Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   Those 36 points were the most by a Grizzlie opponent in the first
half. Baylor scored 37 points in the first half at Madison Square
Garden on Nov. 15, 1960, the Laker record, on his way to 71.</TE>
<TE>   By the third quarter, an otherwise sedate crowd stirred every time
Bryant had the ball on offense, and groaned a little when someone
other than Bryant took a shot.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant blew on his fingertips when he feathered in a 10-foot
fade-away that gave the Lakers a 76-52 lead. He closed his fists when
he double-clutched and dunked with two hands for an 88-56 lead. He
grinned sheepishly when he pulled up from 16 feet, with Grizzlies
hanging from his elbows, and flipped it in for a 98-59 lead.</TE>
<TE>   All in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "All I saw," he said, "was the hoop."</TE>
<TE>   At that point, Bryant had his 56 points, or three fewer than the
Grizzlies, who at all times had five guys, presumably, trying to
score.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth quarter started with Bryant on the bench. When it was
announced, "Mitch Richmond, replacing Kobe Bryant," the crowd booed,
then chanted "Ko-BEE! Ko-BEE!," to no avail. He spent the fourth
quarter with a towel over his shoulders and a wide smile on his face,
not at all disturbed to be out.</TE>
<TE>   "I just felt really good," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   Richmond took the trademark sweatband off Bryant's biceps, and put
it on his own arm, as Bryant laughed. He wiped his hands on Bryant's
legs and wiped the sweat on his own.</TE>
<TE>   Then he went out and made his first jumper.</TE>
<TE>   The patsies in most of this was Shane Battier, the rookie from
Duke. But, he hardly was alone. The Grizzlies ran handfuls of players
at Bryant, including 7-footer Pau Gasol, who blocked Bryant's last
shot--from 25 feet away.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to decide if I needed to run out there myself and
trip him," Grizzlie Coach Sidney Lowe said. "He was unbelievable. He
was certainly making a statement, answering the questions about
Shaq."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was not in the building, one of the requirements of a
suspension. He'd be sorry he missed it.</TE>
<TE>   "That was one of the most incredible things you'll probably ever
see," Robert Horry said. "Words can't describe what that cat did
tonight. He was unreal."</TE>

<HD>Nets Are Feeling Pretty Good</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a self-described "barometer game," the New Jersey Nets showed how
much they are rising.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Kidd had his 41st career triple-double, completing it with
his 10th rebound after Todd MacCulloch blocked a shot with 10 seconds
left as the Nets defeated the San Antonio Spurs, 99-97, Monday night
at East Rutherford, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we measure up pretty good. I think we're at the top," Net
forward Kenyon Martin said.</LD>
<TE>   MacCulloch rejected a shot by Steve Smith, leading to a 3-on-1
break and a layup by Kerry Kittles for a 99-97 lead with six seconds
left. Ex-Net Stephen Jackson missed a three-point shot for the Spurs,
and Malik Rose couldn't convert a short jumper after grabbing the
offensive rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Martin jumped atop the scorer's table as the final buzzer sounded
and the Nets had secured their fifth consecutive victory--their
longest winning streak in nearly four years.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey leads the Eastern Conference with a 25-11 record.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care what people say. I know we have a great team,"
Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   "They can keep doubting us and doubting us, and we'll be in the
playoffs before they know it.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 106, Denver 97--Karl Malone scored 17 of his 26 points in the
second half and Bryon Russell added 17 in a reserve role for the Jazz
at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   John Stockton had 14 points as the Jazz won for the eighth time in
their last 10 games and extended Denver's losing streak on the road
to 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   Denver is still struggling without All-Star forward Antonio
McDyess, out with a torn patella tendon, and Tariq Abdul-Wahad, who
is out after arthroscopic surgery on his left knee.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 113, Dallas 87--Tracy McGrady had 26 points and eight
rebounds to lead the Magic at Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Reserve Troy Hudson scored 16 of his 21 points in the second
quarter as the Magic ended a two-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   The Magic put the game away with a 24-5 run at the start of the
second half. When McGrady made two free throws with 4:21 left in the
quarter, and Darrell Armstrong added another after a technical foul
on Tim Hardaway, Orlando led 84-59.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Monday, Orlando Magic officials formally announced that
the franchise is for sale. The Magic, who haven't convinced local
officials of the need for a new arena, claim they are losing about
$10 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 85, Golden State 79--Eddie Jones scored 28 points at
Oakland, and the Heat ended a three-game losing streak in a meeting
of last-place teams.</TE>
<TE>   Jones was three of 12 from the field in the first half but made a
succession of late jumpers for the Heat, who took charge with a 19-4
run in the fourth quarter that turned a six-point deficit into a
comfortable lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Warriors lost their seventh in a row.</TE>

<HD>Syracuse Holds Off Notre Dame</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Held in check for the first 30 minutes, Preston Shumpert broke
through with seven points to key a decisive 13-1 run that propelled
the eighth-ranked Orangemen to a tough 56-51 victory over Notre Dame
at Syracuse, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   "Even though they're playing that tough on defense, trying to
single me out every single play down the floor, that's just something
I need to do for my teammates," said Shumpert, one for seven from the
field in the first half. "I found some gaps and took advantage of
some opportunities."</LD>
<LD>   Syracuse led by as many as nine in the first half, but Ryan
Humphrey made consecutive baskets with just over 12 minutes to go to
pull the Irish within 39-38.</LD>
<TE>   That's when Shumpert took charge. He converted a layup off an
inbounds pass from Kueth Duany, made a three-point shot from the left
corner off a steal by James Thues, and made a tough shot in the lane
for a 48-39 edge. He finished with 15 points.</TE>
<TE>   It was the seventh straight win for the Orangemen, 16-2 overall
and 5-0 in the Big East. Notre Dame (12-4, 2-2), which had rallied to
win its previous two road games, couldn't pull off another comeback.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 76, San Diego State 70--Jeff Johnsen scored six of his 14
points in the final 28 seconds in a Mountain West Conference game at
Salt Lake City as the Utes won their ninth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Britton Johnsen had 10 points and 11 rebounds for the Utes (12-3,
2-0), who have won 13 in a row against San Diego State (10-6, 0-2).</TE>
<TE>   Texas 74, Texas Tech 71--T.J. Ford and James Thomas combined for
four free throws in the final 23 seconds to give the Longhorns an
overtime Big 12 win at Lubbock, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech (12-4, 3-0) had one last attempt to win, but Marcus
Shropshire's three-point shot bounced off the rim at the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   Ford, Thomas and Brandon Mouton each scored 18 points for the
Longhorns (12-4, 3-0).</TE>
<TE>   Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's game Wednesday against Sacramento State
at Sacramento has been canceled.</TE>

<HD>BCA Upset With Lack of Progress</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Black Coaches Assn. expressed dismay Monday during the last full
day of the NCAA convention at Indianapolis.</LD>
<LD>   When 13 college football coaching positions opened, the BCA mailed
information on more than 50 African American candidates and contacted
each of the schools with an opening. Only one black coach, Tyrone
Willingham, was hired, moving from Stanford to Notre Dame.</LD>
<LD>   "One of the arguments we continued to hear was that, 'We would
certainly have entertained interviewing someone if we had known about
them,'" said Floyd Keith, executive director of the BCA. "So we sent
a list to every Division I-A president and athletic director. If
you're doing your homework, you would research that list."</LD>
<TE>   Keith was joined at a news conference by representatives of the
Minority Opportunities Athletics Assn. and the Minority Opportunities
and Interests Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The group leaders said they were not satisfied with the results of
the BCA's effort to promote black coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham was replaced at Stanford by former Florida assistant
Buddy Teevens, who is white.</TE>
<TE>   One other black coach, Louisiana Lafayette's Jerry Baldwin, was
fired after going 6-27 in three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves only four black head coaches--Willingham, Michigan
State's Bobby Williams, San Jose State's Fitz Hill and New Mexico
State's Tony Samuel--among 115 major college programs.</TE>
<TE>   According to figures released by the BCA, the percentage of black
head coaches declines even more when Division I-AA, Division II and
Division III are added.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding historically black institutions, Keith said, only 14 of
547 head football coaches are black.</TE>
<TE>   If there are not changes, Keith said the organizations may resort
to using "political influence and financial concerns" to bring about
change. None of the leaders would elaborate on that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina running back Derek Watson was dismissed from the
team after he was charged with possession of marijuana, Coach Lou
Holtz said.</TE>
<TE>   Watson was arrested early Saturday in a nightclub parking lot,
according to police Lt. Mike Gambrell in Greenville, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel badly for Derek, but he clearly understood that if he
chose to do certain things, he would no longer be a part of the
football team," Holtz said.</TE>
<TE>   Watson, a junior, led South Carolina in rushing two of the last
three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas running back Cedric Cobbs, arrested last week on drug and
traffic charges, has agreed to random drug testing and other
conditions set down by Coach Houston Nutt. Cobbs and his parents met
with Nutt on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Cobbs faces a court appearance Feb. 20.</TE>
<TE>   To stay on the team, Cobbs agreed to drug counseling and a
provision that forbids him from leaving Fayetteville without first
telling Nutt. He also must complete assigned community service
projects each weekend and attend study hall.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA granted Auburn quarterback Daniel Cobb a rare sixth year
of eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   Cobb, 23, missed the 1997 and 1998 seasons because of a condition
that caused a blood clot in his throwing shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA allows athletes additional playing time for special
circumstances preventing the student from participating for four
years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Donte Stallworth, the Tennessee receiver who changed his mind
about leaving college early for the NFL, must be reinstated by the
NCAA before he can play again for the Volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Stallworth, a junior, said last Thursday that he would leave a
year early to make himself eligible for the NFL draft. But he met
with Coach Phillip Fulmer the next day and said he wanted to stay.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee officials are working to have Stallworth's eligibility
restored so he can return for his senior season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Less than a month after losing to Utah in the Las Vegas Bowl, USC
began off-season conditioning. Rejoining the team was receiver
Marcell Allmond, suspended from school last season after a series of
fights with other students.</TE>
<TE>   Gone from the Trojans are two reserves, kicker John Wall, who has
decided to transfer to Pierce College, and defensive lineman Nate
Goodson, who has quit playing football because of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans are tentatively scheduled to hold spring practice from
March 23 through April 20.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Alexei Yagudin of Russia easily won his qualifying group at the
European Figure Skating Championships at Lausanne, Switzerland,
positioning himself to win back the title in the absence of Yevgeny
Plushchenko.</TE>
<TE>   With teammate Ilya Klimkin second behind Yagudin and Alexander Abt
winning the afternoon group, the Russian trio appears poised for a
sweep of the medals, even without the current European and world
champion, Plushchenko. He is out with a groin injury.</TE>
<TE>   France's Brian Joubert was second to Abt in his group.</TE>
<TE>   The women's event begins Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Andrews, the storied Scotland golf course where Tiger Woods
won his first British Open title in 2000, will hold the tournament
again in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   It will be the 27th time the Open has been played on the Old
Course, just north of Edinburgh. The first time was in 1873.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shelly Finkel, Mike Tyson's advisor, believes a Tyson challenge to
WBC-IBF heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis will be signed by Jan. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, who was in New York, also said the match would be made.</TE>

<TE>   Oleg Lisogor of Ukraine won the 50-meter breaststroke and
100-meter individual medley at a FINA World Cup swim meet at Imperia,
Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Among the women, Chinese and Russian swimmers dominated on the
first of two days of competition.</TE>
<TE>   In the 50-meter breaststroke, Lisogor edged Italy's Domenico
Fioravanti with a time of 26.96 seconds. Lisogor won the 100-meter
individual medley in 54.42, a second ahead of U.S. swimmer Ron
Karnaugh.</TE>

<HD>Dolphins Are Interested in Aikman</HD>

<LD>Jay Fiedler, who has played for two years in the shadow of Dan
Marino's legacy, now must endure comparisons with another probable
Hall of Fame quarterback: Troy Aikman.</LD>
<LD>   The Miami Dolphins' off-season commenced with a quarterback
controversy Monday, thanks to broadcast reports that Aikman might
come out of retirement and join the team.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Dave Wannstedt said he wants Fiedler back and denied the
Dolphins have talked to Aikman. But Wannstedt, an assistant coach in
Dallas during Aikman's prime there, declined to say whether Miami
would be interested in Aikman if he wants to play next season.</LD>
<TE>   Aikman, 35, led the Cowboys to three Super Bowl titles in 12
seasons before retiring last April. Ten concussions contributed to
his decision, and on Jan. 6 he said it was "extremely doubtful" he
would play next season.</TE>
<TE>   Fiedler, 30, can opt out of the final year of his contract, but
Miami can keep him by matching any offer. He said his preference is
to remain with the Dolphins, and he shrugged off the possibility of
the team signing Aikman.</TE>
<TE>   "If they go in that direction, then my opportunities will lie
somewhere else," Fiedler said.</TE>
<TE>   Aikman's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said there have been no
discussions with the Dolphins.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a year away from the bumps and bruises of his last season in
Dallas," Steinberg said. "If the right opportunity came along, he
would certainly listen."</TE>
<TE>   When asked if the Dolphins would have any interest in Aikman if he
comes out of retirement, Wannstedt said, "It's a hypothetical
question. Troy is retired. I wouldn't even comment on that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh receiver Plaxico Burress pleaded no contest to carrying
an open alcoholic beverage container while walking on a downtown
street in Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   The second-year NFL player paid a $50 fine and $100 in court
costs, as ordered by Cleveland Municipal Judge Ronald Adrine.</TE>

<TE>   The Denver Broncos signed offensive guard Michael Lies.</TE>
<TE>   He was waived by Miami in August after playing for the Birmingham
Bolts of the XFL.</TE>

<LD>Adam Oates considered his 1,000th assist a family milestone.</LD>
<LD>   Dainius Zubrus scored 13 seconds into overtime on a play set up by
Oates to lead the Washington Capitals to a 1-0 victory over the
Boston Bruins on Monday night at Washington.</LD>
<LD>   "I talked to my mom and dad all in the last couple weeks, and for
our family it really means a lot," Oates said. "They have been
watching me for 35 years, and that's a lot of hockey games. It's very
special for them and I owe it all to them."</LD>
<TE>   Olaf Kolzig made 30 saves for his third shutout of the season and
24th of his career for the Capitals, who are unbeaten in their last
four games.</TE>
<TE>   Kolzig has gone 134 minutes and 34 seconds without giving up a
goal.</TE>
<TE>   "The 30 shots obviously was one thing," Kolzig said. "But we've
really, really in the last week cut down on the odd-man rushes
against, and that's been the key to our success. We're giving teams
perimeter shots now and not the high-quality stuff we were used to
giving up in the first part of the season."</TE>
<TE>   Oates, 39, who leads the league with 37 assists, became the eighth
NHL player to reach 1,000 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 5, Montreal 3--John LeClair had two goals, and the
Flyers scored three times in the third period to rally at Montreal
and extend their winning streak to five games.</TE>
<TE>   Simon Gagne, Keith Primeau and Jeremy Roenick also scored for the
Flyers, who have not lost since a 5-2 defeat at San Jose on Jan. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia is 11-2-0 in its last 13, and leads the Atlantic
Division with 58 points.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 2, Edmonton 1--Alex Zhamnov and Phil Housley scored 1:13
apart early in the third period to lift the Blackhawks at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Jocelyn Thibault stopped 17 shots for the Blackhawks, who outshot
Edmonton, 15-3, in the third period and have won eight of their last
10 games.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus 2, New York Rangers 2--Tyler Wright scored with 1:09
remaining in regulation to give the Blue Jackets a tie at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Andreas Johansson of the Rangers had a power-play goal before
breaking his left wrist in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Theo Fleury ended his eight-game pointless streak with a goal for
the Rangers, whose winless streak has reached seven games (0-5-1-1).</TE>

<KH>Lonnie White  ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>New Conditioning Gives Kings a Lift</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you don't know who Joseph Horrigan and Dave Good are, you're not
alone. Not many hockey fans do.</LD>
<LD>   But if the streaking Kings continue to roll over opponents as they
have in going 11-3-3 over their last 17 games, Horrigan and Good
should be given their share of credit for transforming the Kings into
one of the toughest teams in the NHL.</LD>
<LD>   Horrigan is in his third season as the Kings' speed-strength and
conditioning coach. Good is his assistant, who travels with the team.
By emphasizing explosive training with weights, rather than hockey's
traditional aerobics, Horrigan and Good have helped turn the Kings
into a faster, stronger team that wears opponents down.</LD>
<TE>   "Joe and Dave have the theory that we can actually gain strength
during the season," General Manager Dave Taylor said. "The old
thought used to be that you did most of your training during the
off-season and you tried to maintain and not lose much during the
season. But we have players now who actually increase their max lift
over the course of the season."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' conditioning was on display during the team's recent
trip--five games in eight nights--that included an NHL-first
three-game sweep of the New York-area teams, the Islanders, Rangers
and New Jersey Devils.</TE>
<TE>   But probably the most impressive aspect of the Kings' 4-1 trip was
how they were able to bounce back and win an important divisional
game at San Jose less than 48 hours after losing an emotionally
draining showdown at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   By lifting year-round, even on the road, the Kings have taken an
approach used in the NFL for years. And it seems to be working. The
Kings believe they're stronger than most teams.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the first things introduced to conditioning for hockey was
the stationary bike," said Horrigan, who has more than 20 years'
experience in sports medicine. "All coaches wanted to know was their
players' aerobic fitness. But the problem is that hockey is an
anaerobic game. It's a sport made up of short bursts interspersed
with breaks. You have shift changes, TV timeouts and breaks between
periods."</TE>
<TE>   In less than three years, Horrigan and his staff have helped turn
many of the Kings' once shaky role players into nightly contributors.
It's a key reason behind the team's growing respect around the
league.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys are really receptive to it," Good said of the team's
cutting-edge program, based largely on free weight training. "When it
got down to February and March and the team was fighting for a
playoff spot last season, they were feeling that much stronger and
that's when they realized that it works. They know that our program
works when you stay with it all season long, including our road
workouts."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings made a late-season run into the playoffs last season,
upset Detroit in the first round, then extended the eventual Stanley
Cup champion Colorado Avalanche to seven games before losing in the
second round.</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Philippe Boucher may be the King who has benefited most
from Horrigan's system. Early in his career, Boucher was regarded as
a one-dimensional player who had a hard shot and little else. He
spent several seasons bouncing between the minors and the Kings, but
his game has taken off since he began training under Horrigan.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a guy who has really improved through our program and it's
showing this year," said Horrigan, who also heads sports chiropractic
centers in Manhattan Beach and Century City. Boucher has 20 points in
44 games, leads the team with 123 shots on goal and is third in hits
with 86. Coach Andy Murray has often referred to him as the Kings'
most consistent player this season and Boucher credits his new
approach to off-ice training.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been around for 10 years and I can tell that the athletes
are getting bigger and stronger," he said. "There's no way around it.
You have to really work hard. The younger kids coming in now are
really prepared. You can't wait until training camp to get in shape,
like you used to."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to the confidence they've gained from Horrigan's program,
the Kings believe they will be the stronger team when games get tight
down the stretch. It's an edge that has brought them within a point
of the No. 8 playoff spot in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Kings Are Not Alone</TE>
<TE>   More and more NHL players have switched to new training
techniques, hoping to get an edge. Washington Coach Ron Wilson said
the success of players such as Peter Forsberg, Jaromir Jagr and
Dominik Hasek has helped speed the change.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to credit the European influence on improving the
conditioning part of our game here," Wilson said. "The Europeans
spent a lot more time in the summertime as groups doing off-ice
conditioning. They have always not played as many games, while the
mentality of the NHL was that you needed the summer to rest and
recuperate from the long season. Sometimes, the season seemed so long
because guys weren't in the type of shape they should've been. This
is a better way to withstand the rigors of a long season, to work out
in the summer."</TE>
<TE>   Because teams are under pressure to win, everyone is looking for
an advantage, which has made strength coaches more important. Teams
not open to making the switch have been left behind.</TE>
<TE>   "Strength coaches are divided into two groups: those who primarily
use free weights and those who primarily use machines," Horrigan
said. "The Kings are with the camp that uses free weights and the
results can't be overlooked. From two years ago, the average team
vertical jump has improved five inches and that's typical for our
program. We have always said that we train for the third period. We
applied movements that train the whole body. We treat the entire body
as a unit."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the rapid rise in salaries, players realize they can't
afford to fall behind in conditioning.</TE>
<TE>   "Without a doubt, guys take more care of their bodies now than
they did when I first started, and I started in the 1990-91 season,"
Mighty Duck forward Marty McInnis said. "Players are much stronger.
Guys now have a stretching routine that takes up to 45 minutes even
before we even go out to practice. You used to never see that
before."</TE>
<TE>   Line Shifts</TE>
<TE>   * Former Duck Teemu Selanne has only 14 goals and it's starting to
become an issue around San Jose. Selanne ended an 11-game
goal-scoring drought over the weekend, in a game just after San Jose
Coach Darryl Sutter had reportedly ripped into him.</TE>
<TE>   Although both Sutter and Selanne have denied the story, Sutter
reportedly told the sharpshooting forward, "I don't care if you get
into your Porsche and drive back to Anaheim right now."</TE>
<TE>   Said Dean Lombardi, the San Jose general manager who is paying
Selanne nearly $9.5 million this season, "I don't care if it was
said, because some things are said in the heat of battle. But stuff
like that has got to stay in the [dressing] room. Hey, the coach gets
a little upset, fine. I don't know a player in there it hasn't
happened with. We're all men here."</TE>
<TE>   * Wayne Gretzky, Team Canada's executive director, is standing
behind New York's Theo Fleury, apparently unconcerned about the
forward's recent emotional outbursts. Gretzky told the New York Post
that he hasn't considered taking Fleury off Canada's Olympic team.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not even a question mark," he said. "Theo has earned the
right to be there. My goodness. I don't see how anyone could think
otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   * Some of the top contenders in the Eastern Conference are quietly
wondering about the Rangers' Eric Lindros, who has played tentatively
since returning to the lineup after suffering his seventh concussion
last month. With Lindros not playing aggressively, Philadelphia
roughed up the Rangers last week.</TE>
<TE>   * Things should be interesting when the Ducks play at Calgary on
Saturday. The Flames are on the verge of dropping out of a playoff
spot but will be looking for payback after last month's brawl-marred
game, which Anaheim won, 4-0.</TE>
<TE>   * Colorado remains a legitimate contender for the Stanley Cup,
even though six-time all-star center Forsberg is out for the
season--without having played a game--because of a broken foot. The
main reason the Avalanche will still be in the hunt is goaltender
Patrick Roy, who said recently, "I'm probably playing the best hockey
of my career."</TE>

<KH>Mike Penner  ON THE NFL</KH>
<HD>Quarterbacks Get Dealt In Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is still not entirely safe to watch the NFL playoffs--the Ravens
avoided the wooden stake again and are (shudder) the only team to
have defeated Pittsburgh at Pittsburgh this season--but there is
encouraging news to report in the wake of wild-card weekend:</LD>
<LD>   Quarterbacks are back.</LD>
<LD>   Twelve months have passed since Trent Dilfer and Kerry Collins
didn't in Super Bowl XXXV. The dark ages of professional football
history, those four quarters were.</LD>
<TE>   In a copycat league, quarterback-free football threatened to
consume the NFL in 2001-02, with such old-time powerhouses as Dallas,
Washington and Buffalo quickly adopting the same approach.</TE>
<TE>   But the first four playoff games of the new tournament have done
great things for our severely shaken fundamental value system.</TE>
<TE>   In all four games, the team with the better quarterback won.</TE>
<TE>   You have to go back to the last millennium to find another
postseason weekend for which that claim could be made.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, it was Donovan McNabb over Brad Johnson in Philadelphia
and Rich Gannon over Vinny Testaverde in Oakland, pretty much as
expected.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, in a quarterback matchup that rekindled memories of Bart
Starr versus John Brodie (i.e., Starr usually won), cagey veteran
Brett Favre outsmarted Jeff Garcia, who will soon play in his second
Pro Bowl but was making only his first NFL playoff start.</TE>
<TE>   And, in something less than that, in Miami, Elvis Grbac was better
than Jay Fiedler. Not much to base a playoff portfolio on, perhaps,
but it's more than Grbac had before Sunday: eight years in the
league, 0-1 in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   One good weekend begets another, and beget a load of this:</TE>
<TE>   Next Sunday in St. Louis, Favre squares off against Kurt Warner,
indoors, on artificial turf. The two best passers in the sport,
training-camp teammates once upon a time, with two Lombardi trophies
and five league most-valuable-player awards between them. What's the
over-under on touchdown passes in this one? Six or seven?</TE>
<TE>   As a Saturday appetizer, the Oakland-New England second-rounder
will bring together two more Pro Bowl quarterbacks, Gannon and Tom
Brady. On paper, it's an appealing matchup--late-bloomer Gannon
against out-of-nowhere Brady--and we'd like to ask Drew Bledsoe to
handicap it, but he's too interested in Philadelphia at Chicago. If
Jim Miller loses that one, Chicago will probably go quarterback
hunting, which means Bledsoe will probably go house hunting in
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth game, Baltimore at Pittsburgh, pits Grbac against
Kordell Stewart. Not quite the same juice as Favre-Warner, but the
thought of Grbac and Stewart trying to operate with a frozen football
amid snow-plow conditions does make for imaginative entertainment
possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   For the first-round losers, learning the hard way, the message was
similar if worded a bit differently:</TE>
<TE>   Quarterbacks, you might not be back.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, Garcia is safe, although Terrell Owens is
calling out for a different game plan. Limited to four receptions for
40 yards in the 49ers' 25-15 loss at Green Bay, Owens blamed the
play-calling, angrily telling reporters, "If I'm the best player on
the team, why can't I get the ball? That's all I ask. Give me an
opportunity and give the offense an opportunity to get some points on
the board. I didn't get enough opportunities to get the ball. There
were times I was beating my guy all day."</TE>
<TE>   Is Terrell Owens the best player on the team?</TE>
<TE>   Why can't he get the ball?</TE>
<TE>   Was he beating his guy at times, or was he beating his guy all
day?</TE>
<TE>   Take time to discuss, 49er fans. You have six months.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere among the eliminated, consider the fallout, coming or
expected:</TE>
<TE>   * Jets: Vinny Testaverde could be out, Chad Pennington could be
in.</TE>
<TE>   * Buccaneers: Brad Johnson could be out, now that Bill Parcells,
who has probably seen enough, is coming in.</TE>
<TE>   * Dolphins: Fiedler could be out, because Miami management has the
option of buying out the final year of his contract. And coming in?
Would you believe ... Troy Aikman?</TE>
<TE>   ABC News Radio reported Sunday, shortly after Fiedler had finished
off a 20-3 loss to Baltimore, that Aikman was "99% sure" of
attempting a comeback next season and would like to do it in Miami,
provided Coach Dave Wannstedt, Aikman's defensive coordinator in
Dallas, can hire Norv Turner, Aikman's offensive coordinator in
Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Monday, Wannstedt tried gamely to deflect the Aikman speculation,
insisting that the Dolphins were intent on re-signing Fiedler. But
talk is cheap and with Fiedler due to make $1.2 million next season,
these numbers are expensive: 15 for 28 for 122 yards and an
interception against Baltimore, consecutive playoff defeats by a
cumulative score of 47-3.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterbacks are certain to be flying in and out of Washington,
now that Steve Spurrier has signed on to replace Marty
Schottenheimer. With any luck, camera crews will be on hand when
Spurrier gathers the Redskin quarterback incumbents for their first
off-season workout.</TE>
<TE>   "Tony Banks?! Says here you've played for three teams since
January 2001. That's wrong. Must be a typographical error. After
today, it's four.</TE>
<TE>   "Kent Graham?! You have got to be kidding me. Next!</TE>
<TE>   "Sage Rosenfels?! For the love of.... You know, I do owe Rex
Grossman an apology."</TE>
<TE>   Quarterbacks are back, and if you don't have one, you need to act
quickly. Mel Kiper Jr. just rejiggered his 2002 draft handicap for
ESPN Insider and, for the next 10 minutes, until he rejiggers again,
has two quarterbacks going in the top four picks: Oregon's Joey
Harrington to the expansion Houston Texans, Fresno State's David Carr
to the Buffalo Bills.</TE>
<TE>   Football remains an 11-man game, despite the grim predictions
after last year's Super Bowl, when both offenses played a man down
and appeared to be pot-holing a road to the future. Fortunately, that
too did pass.</TE>

<LD>After two days of study and observation, I've come up with a new and
revolutionary theory to explain Saturday's right hook by our favorite
heavyweight.</LD>
<LD>   Shaquille O'Neal chased down the Chicago Bulls' Brad Miller and
threw a punch at the back of his head, grazing his left ear, right?
For that, he was suspended three games and fined $15,000, correct?</LD>
<LD>   This is going to sound crazy, so bear with me.</LD>
<TE>   I'm not going to blame the referees.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not going to blame the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not going to blame Brad Miller.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not going to blame big-man stereotypes, anti-Laker bias, or
even fat-mouthed knuckleheads named Oakley.</TE>
<TE>   This is going to come across as completely knee-jerked and nuts,
but here goes:</TE>
<TE>   I'm blaming Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This town's love for the Lakers is honorable and inspirational
and, on downtown street corners in June, overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   But in this case, it's also a bit silly.</TE>
<TE>   A guy throws a sucker punch that may have killed someone if it
connected. With the ensuing suspension, the guy may cost his team
victories and perhaps eventual playoff home-court advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Fans who pay to see that guy, they won't. Kids who have modeled
their behavior after that guy, can't.</TE>
<TE>   Yet by criticizing the guy who threw the punch, I'm going to be
the sucker.</TE>
<TE>   So be it.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, as it has been written here at least once for every dunk,
has been maybe the best free-agent signing in this town's sports
history.</TE>
<TE>   He plays hard. He wins championships. He avoids trouble. He is as
kind as he is large, as good-tempered as he is talented.</TE>
<TE>   But Saturday night in Chicago, he blew it.</TE>
<TE>   If only more people would say he blew it.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, we have heard print and broadcast folks talk about how he
was justified in retaliating for years of flagrant fouls.</TE>
<TE>   We have heard teammates talk about how they are surprised he
hasn't punched anyone sooner.</TE>
<TE>   The theme has been as clear as O'Neal's attack was dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, it's about time he punched someone.</TE>
<TE>   Said Kobe Bryant: "You have to defend yourself. Sometimes saying
things just doesn't cut it. You have to stand up for your
self-respect."</TE>
<TE>   Added Samaki Walker: "We're not saying fighting is good, but
sometimes a man's got to do what he's got to do."</TE>
<TE>   Last time I heard quotes like that, they came from athletes
wearing skates.</TE>
<TE>   Thank goodness Laker officials emphasized Monday that the club
doesn't share those same views.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not how you gain respect as a player, it is not about
fighting," said Coach Phil Jackson after the morning shoot-around.</TE>
<TE>   Later that night, before the Lakers' 120-81 victory over the
Memphis Grizzlies, General Manager Mitch Kupchak echoed those
sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't condone this type of behavior," he said. "In no way do
we approve of what happened. The team is hurt, the NBA is hurt,
people with season seats are hurt."</TE>
<TE>   This teamwork among players is good. But nothing will help the
Lakers like the truth.</TE>
<TE>   And the truth is, the punch solved nothing, other than reducing
O'Neal's tax base by $714,285.72.</TE>
<TE>   You think it will change the way the NBA officiates those who try
to defend O'Neal with shoves and hacks?</TE>
<TE>   If it does, then the referees also will have to begin calling
charging fouls when O'Neal elbows defenders as he lumbers across the
middle.</TE>
<TE>   If that happened, the games would take four hours, or nearly as
long as anything involving the Angels, and you know how long that
would last.</TE>
<TE>   You think, too, that the punch will make one of these low-rent
centers think twice before taking a punk shot at O'Neal?</TE>
<TE>   Hmmm, let's see, Miller and Oakley got O'Neal ejected from a game
that the Bulls won, then cost the Lakers the use of their best player
for a week. And they're supposed to think twice about that?</TE>
<TE>   The truth is that the rougher it gets, the cooler O'Neal must
remain. He is not only this team's leader, he is also its pulse. When
he gets dizzy, so do they. When he loses control, so will they.</TE>
<TE>   Being Goliath is one thing. Dealing with all those stones is
another. But O'Neal needs to figure out a way.</TE>
<TE>   "If a guy makes 85% of his free throws, this problem will go way,
I'm sure that's what the other general managers of the league will
tell me," Kupchak said. "But then I would say to them, make a play on
the ball, stop making a play on the head."</TE>
<TE>   Improved free-throw shooting is indeed one solution. But seeing as
it may be too late in the season for that, maybe the Lakers should be
content with improving his feet.</TE>
<TE>   What probably bothered O'Neal more than the fouls Saturday was
that he had to absorb them on those aching dogs.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal has long hidden his pain better than anyone. But there's no
more hiding the beating inflicted by two feet that have to support a
frame that is, to be generous, several pounds overweight.</TE>
<TE>   Here's guessing O'Neal wouldn't have attacked Miller if his feet
had not been attacking him first.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the suspension will help those feet. Maybe even more rest is
needed.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe when O'Neal returns, he will admit what few seem capable
of admitting, that he made a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   If the morality of the issue doesn't sway him, maybe sitting home
Monday while Kobe Bryant scored a league-high 56 points in three
quarters against the Grizzlies will.</TE>

<HD>Shaq's Out; Kobe's Way In</HD>
<DH>Laker Center Suspended for Three Games, Fined $15,000</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On an idling bus in Chicago, a decade into an NBA career mostly spent
bartering physical abuse, Shaquille O'Neal turned to a friend and
told him his days of taking it were over.</LD>
<LD>   He was alone with Rick Fox, an hour after throwing the punch that
by Monday afternoon had resulted in a three-game suspension, loss of
three games' pay and a $15,000 fine.</LD>
<LD>   "That's how it's going to be from here on out," O'Neal told Fox.
"I'm not going for this no more."</LD>
<TE>   Stu Jackson, the NBA's senior vice president, announced the
penalties stemming from Saturday night's brawl in Chicago, beginning
with O'Neal, who also will lose $714,285.72 in salary for the punch
he threw at Bull center Brad Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago forward Charles Oakley, who fouled O'Neal with 2:44 left
in regulation, was charged with a flagrant foul and suspended for two
games, one for the flagrant and the other for accumulating too many
points in flagrant fouls. Oakley also was fined $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, who fouled O'Neal on the same play, was suspended for a
game for a flagrant foul and fined $7,500.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, assessed two technical fouls and ejected after arguing with
lead official Danny Crawford, was not punished further.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson would not discuss his reasoning for the length of O'Neal's
suspension, which began Monday night against the Memphis Grizzlies.
O'Neal also will miss games Wednesday against the Miami Heat and
Saturday against the San Antonio Spurs. He can return Jan. 22 for a
home game against the Denver Nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson apparently believed O'Neal's punch fell somewhere between
Marcus Camby's attack on Danny Ferry last season, which brought a
five-game suspension, and Kenyon Martin's punch of Tracy McGrady
earlier this season, for which he was suspended for two games.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal's punch--from behind--merely grazed Miller's ear but
Jackson ruled as if O'Neal had landed the blow.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal participated in the Lakers' shoot-around Monday morning,
and afterward declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   "I ain't a punk and I ain't a whiner," he said. "I got nothing to
say."</TE>
<TE>   Later, he emerged from the team's locker room with a piece of tape
across his mouth. "KISS ME" was written in black marker on the tape.</TE>
<TE>   When he returns, it apparently will not be as the player who took
hard fouls to his head and neck without complaint. Fox said O'Neal
was more serious than he'd ever seen him, and that he believed O'Neal
was about to change the way he reacted. "He's never said that
before," Fox said. "I've seen him get upset, be in fights. But I was
there at half-court when he told the ref, 'You don't care, I don't
care.' He told Miller, 'You see my lip?' His lip was [swollen]
already. He told Miller, 'You do that again, we're going to be
fighting.' He's to the point where there's been nine years of that."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers, generally, were pleased that the suspension was not
five games. The organization and O'Neal, however, will ask the league
to review how its referees officiate play around O'Neal. O'Neal's
agent, Perry Rogers, and business manager, Mike Parris, have
scheduled a Friday meeting with Commissioner David Stern in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "My hope is, [O'Neal] felt he had to send a message," Laker
General Manager Mitch Kupchak said. "And, he did. Clearly, the NBA
had spent a lot of time looking at this event, and I think it's
something that will be watched closely."</TE>
<TE>   Kupchak spoke primarily of fouls delivered without the intent of
blocking a shot, and to parts of O'Neal's body that are not holding
the basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "When you catch a ball and somebody goes for your head or neck,
it's tough to play the game," Kupchak said.</TE>
<TE>   In Chicago, the Bulls took their penalties with little objection
and refused to back away from their aggressive approach toward
O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Miller called O'Neal's punch "kind of a coward thing."</TE>
<TE>   "I was in a couple fights when I was young, but at least everybody
knew it was coming," Miller said. "There's going to be repercussions
if you come back at him. Plus, I don't have a chance to do anything
to this guy. I'm not going to dent him. It's a lose-lose situation
for me."</TE>
<TE>   Oakley had challenged his teammates to play O'Neal with more zeal
the day before the game, and they were very aggressive during it.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the game," Oakley said. "Walter Payton didn't gain 16,000
yards without getting hit. In basketball, when he's that big, he goes
up and guys will foul him. He didn't fall down.... That just goes to
show you, it was a foul that he could've had continuation on and
dunked."</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson said O'Neal's suspension was "pretty
extreme," considering the punch had not landed. He also claimed
O'Neal redirected the punch in order to miss Miller, though he seems
to be alone in the opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a dead shot at the guy," Jackson said. "I think he pulled
the punch at the end."</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "Nah," he said. "I think Brad Miller got lucky."</TE>
<TE>   As did O'Neal, of course.</TE>
<TE>   "That frustration wears on him," Fox said. "Not being able to go
about his business the way he normally does. It's about being human.
He's Superman, but his discussions, outwardly, have been along the
lines of, 'How much longer do I want to do this, if this is what I'm
going to have to put up with?' He looks for the respect. He wants to
be treated fairly.</TE>
<TE>   "At what point is your breaking point? Obviously it was right
there for him. It took a long time to get to that. I think he's had
enough of that."</TE>
<TE>   The question, then, is will O'Neal stay on that emotional edge.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a statement for the rest of the league," Bryant
said. "Shaq is not going to stand for getting pounded and beaten
every single night."</TE>

<HD>Folk Family Has a Toehold in Two Sports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Folk family of Woodland Hills is torn between its passion for
futbol and football.</LD>
<LD>   Brothers Nick, 17, Greg, 14, and Erik, 12, are dedicated club
soccer players who insist they'd play in the World Cup rather than
the Super Bowl, if given the chance.</LD>
<LD>   But Nick, a senior at Sherman Oaks Notre Dame High, is facing a
difficult decision: He's all-Southern Section in soccer and football.
Arizona has offered him a scholarship to become its kicker; San
Francisco wants him to play soccer. The Folks are not much different
from many families in the U.S., where children start out playing
soccer but begin trying other sports before they reach their teenage
years.</LD>
<TE>   The Folks' father, Tony, was born in Austria, emigrated from
Germany when he was 4 and played football and soccer growing up. He
and his wife, Kathy, a pediatrician, viewed soccer as the ideal
energy release for their boys.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always looked at sports as giving our kids an opportunity
to do something besides sitting in front of a TV," Tony said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Kathy: "Do you know how many times I've said, 'Don't play
with the ball in the house.' That's my favorite line."</TE>
<TE>   The boys started playing soccer at age 5 and never stopped through
broken lamps and broken arms. When high school arrived, football
became another option. Nick started kicking and Greg followed.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Nick made field goals of 52 and 50 yards in one game.
He also kicked a game-winning 32-yard field goal with 12 seconds left
to defeat La Canada St. Francis.</TE>
<TE>   Greg, a freshman, kicked a 43-yard field goal for the junior
varsity. And Erik, a seventh-grader, was a kicker for his grammar
school team. He might become the first Folk to play a position other
than kicker.</TE>
<TE>   "[Those] two don't want to get hit," the feisty 5-foot-1,
100-pound Erik said.</TE>
<TE>   Kathy was the consummate soccer mom this past winter, coordinating
carpools and transportation issues. All three boys competed for their
club soccer and school football teams simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   Those who wanted to create chaos in the Folk family only needed to
remove the calendar on the refrigerator. The dates informed everyone
when practices and games would be held. "I went to England and
Germany before Hell Week [at football practice]," Nick said. "Greg
went to Brazil for 10 days, and he's going to Mexico in a couple of
weeks and will miss a couple high school [soccer] games."</TE>
<TE>   During the Southern Section football quarterfinals, Nick was in
San Diego for a club soccer tournament, drove to Palmdale on a Friday
night to kick for Notre Dame, then returned to San Diego the next
morning. Greg missed the game to participate in a national soccer
camp in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   It goes on and on, football vs. soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people think soccer is a wuss sport and it's not," Nick
said. "You get bumps and bruises everywhere. You get elbows in the
head, you get kicked in the ankles, your shins, your shoulder,
everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Nick helped Notre Dame's soccer team reach the Division IV
semifinals last season. Greg is a starter there this season. Erik
plays on a youth team.</TE>
<TE>   They practice in the family backyard, shooting at a regulation
goal. If the ball is kicked too far, however, it goes into a
neighbor's yard, forcing the boys to take quick action. Guess who
they send over the fence to retrieve the ball and avoid the
neighbor's dog?</TE>
<TE>   Erik, of course.</TE>
<TE>   "We help him over and hope he lives," Nick said.</TE>
<TE>   Each brother is an honors student. The pressure to excel in school
comes from a family in which two grandparents, two uncles and an aunt
are doctors, with Harvard, UCLA and California among the schools they
attended. Their father is an accountant. Their mother was a high
school valedictorian.</TE>
<TE>   The boys know not to fake illness to avoid going to school, not
with a mother who's a pediatrician who has seen every trick in the
book.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if we're throwing up, my mom goes, 'Go to school, you're
fine,'" Nick said. "You can't fool her."</TE>
<TE>   So what's Nick going to do, play soccer or football in college?</TE>
<TE>   "I love soccer more than I love football, but I see more
opportunities for football," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Football scholarships pay 100% of college costs. Soccer
scholarships routinely are split among many players on a team. Then
there's the chance of playing professionally.</TE>
<TE>   Nick took his recruiting trip to Arizona last weekend and decided
to accept the football scholarship offer.</TE>
<TE>   Next up is Greg, who's considered a better soccer player than
Nick. He'll have three years to decide which sport is best for him.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Bozeman Develops by the Minute</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was time for Cedric Bozeman to increase his minutes.</LD>
<LD>   But was the timing right? The opponent was No. 1-ranked Kansas and
the freshman guard had not played well in three games since returning
from a knee injury.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA Coach Steve Lavin believed so, and Bozeman rewarded him by
running the offense with confidence and playing intense defense in
the Bruins' victory Saturday. He played 27 minutes--the same amount
he logged in the three previous games combined.</LD>
<TE>   Eventually, Bozeman will be a starter--as he was for four games
before the injury. But Lavin is in no hurry because UCLA (12-3) has
won 10 of 11 with senior Rico Hines in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Hines' minutes dwindled to 11 against the Jayhawks, and the games
in which he got 25 to 30 minutes might be over. It's Bozeman's turn
to play more than half the time, especially if he plays as well as he
did against Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Rico will still be the starter, he does so many good
things defensively," Lavin said. "But Ced has to play to improve and
he has to play for us to get to where we want to be in March."</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman had four points and three assists against Kansas, but he
might be the type of player who contributes more than numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought Bozeman played very well, he's a good, big guard,"
Jayhawk Jeff Boschee said. "Their offense was very smooth when he was
out there."</TE>

<HD>Anteaters Find Ways to Win</HD>

<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UC Irvine will gladly take all its nail-biting victories, but it
would also like a few more easy wins.</LD>
<LD>   After Jerry Green won the Anteaters' showdown last Thursday at
Utah State with a buzzer-beating shot, Irvine got a rare breather
Saturday with its 92-54 drubbing of Idaho to build a 11/2-game lead
in the Big West Conference.</LD>
<LD>   The Anteaters (12-4, 5-0) have won eight games decided by 10
points or fewer this season after winning 15 games by five points or
fewer in their record-breaking 25-5 season last year.</LD>
<TE>   It gives fifth-year Coach Pat Douglass a fair share of confidence
in tight games. But he'd rather not have every game come down to the
end.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, it'll allow me to stay in this profession a little bit
longer," Douglass said during the Big West's midseason conference
call. "Our kids will focus when their backs are against the wall."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine, the defending Big West regular-season champion, maintained
its focus throughout on Saturday. The Anteaters shot 56% in the first
half in taking a 46-23 lead, then blitzed Idaho in the second half by
making 17 of 22 field-goal attempts.</TE>
<TE>   The Anteaters continue to get production from players other than
Green. Guard Mike Hood made seven of nine three-point baskets and
scored a career-high 25 points against the Vandals.</TE>
<TE>   "We have five kids who can shoot the ball," Douglass said. "I
think it's just a matter of Jerry learning to trust the other guys
more. There's times when he tries to take on too much."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brian Quinn began his new job as athletic director at Cal State
Fullerton on Monday and said it was "good to be back in the wars" of
college athletics. He succeeded John Easterbrook, who retired.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn, 60, was athletic director at Loyola Marymount from 1985-98
and most recently worked in Loyola's planned giving department.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to be back working in intercollegiate athletics
directly, to be working with students and educating young people,"
Quinn said.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn said he is optimistic that Fullerton's struggling men's and
women's basketball programs will improve. The Titan men have been on
NCAA probation for infractions that date to 1993 and only recently
had sanctions lifted that prevented them from recruiting junior
college players.</TE>
<TE>   "I have confidence in both teams, and once they get up and running
then you can start looking downstream at a new [arena]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Fullerton men's basketball team will try to end a six-game
losing streak on Thursday when it plays Idaho State in a Big West
game at Fullerton. Utah State visits Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The Titans are 3-11 overall and 0-5 in the Big West, their worst
start in conference play since 1987-88 when they started 0-7.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Building on the momentum of a strong finish to the 2001 men's
volleyball season, UC Irvine started 2002 with victories over
Pepperdine and USC in its Wyndham West Coast Challenge tournament
last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   After a three-game loss to UCLA Friday, the Anteaters defeated
Pepperdine in five games Saturday and came back later in the day to
defeat the Trojans in four.</TE>
<TE>   The victories were key for Irvine, which has its eye on becoming a
top-five team this season. The Anteaters have steadily improved in
Coach Charlie Brande's six seasons and appear ready for a major
breakthrough.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first got here, I came here with great hopes," said
Brande, whose team went 13-13 last season. "The first time I went
through the league [Mountain Pacific Sports Federation], I thought
that we could play forever and not beat these teams.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are different now. Our experience level is so much higher
and our bench is the deepest we've ever had."</TE>
<TE>   Middle blocker Erick Helenihi, a 6-foot-8 senior, is the key
returning player for the Anteaters. Brande said his depth has
improved so much that he moved Helenihi to left side hitter to get
6-7 sophomore Kyle Weichert in the middle and make Irvine a bigger
team.</TE>
<TE>   All of Irvine's starters, except setter David Kniffin, are 6-6 or
taller.</TE>
<TE>   Much of that can be attributed to improvements in recruiting.
Brande said keeping some of Orange County's top players at home was a
key and credits assistant coach Jason Bilbruck with delivering them.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 22 players on the roster, 14 are from either San Diego or
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Preseason No. 1 and two-time defending NCAA champion UCLA dropped
a spot in the latest national poll after losing to second-ranked
Georgia, 197.900-196.875, in a dual meet Sunday at Athens, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA sophomore Jamie Dantzscher scored a 10 on the vault, the
first of her college career. Dantzscher also won the uneven bars
routine.</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Rigamat and Mary-Frances Monroe of UCLA were named to
the Soccer Buzz magazine All-America second team. UCLA senior
defender Krista Boling and Pepperdine junior defender Susan Palmer
were honorable-mention selections.... Ashcon Madjid, a 6-4, 290-pound
offensive lineman, has transferred from Cal State Northridge to Tulsa
to continue playing football. Northridge eliminated its football
program in November.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>USC men's basketball Coach Henry Bibby has spent most of the season
riding his seniors for leadership.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Bibby turned to a junior on the bench, appointing
reserve Robert Hutchinson as team captain, a title usually bestowed
to a senior earlier in the season.</LD>
<LD>   Hutchinson has played in USC's 15 games, starting one, and is
averaging 2.4 points and 13.1 minutes. He has 24 assists and eight
steals.</LD>
<TE>   In USC's 81-67 victory at Loyola Marymount on Dec. 22, Hutchinson
sparked the Trojans with a career-high 10 points in a career-best 26
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC's seven-week absence from the Associated Press poll ended
Monday when the Trojans were ranked No. 18.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't make too much of it," USC senior Sam Clancy said of the
Trojans being ranked for the first time since Nov. 19.</TE>
<TE>   "We've just got to keep winning and can't worry about the rankings
because we know if we drop one we're probably out. We've got to bring
it every day because teams are going to be shooting for us."</TE>
<TE>   Five Pacific 10 Conference teams were ranked for the first time
since Feb. 13, 1995, with USC behind No. 9 UCLA, which the Trojans
beat last week, and No. 15 Arizona, which the Trojans play Thursday,
but ahead of No. 19 Stanford and No. 23 Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   The coaches' poll was released Sunday and, despite leading the
conference with a 5-0 record, the Trojans (13-2) were the
fifth-ranked Pac-10 team, tied with Georgia at No. 23.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA was ranked 11th, Stanford 16th, Arizona 18th and Oregon 22nd.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in first place and the lowest-ranked," Clancy said.
"There's still no respect. But until we beat the Arizonas and the
Stanfords and the UCLAs [again], there probably won't be any."</TE>
<TE>   Senior point guard Brandon Granville had two steals in USC's
victory over UCLA last week, giving him 203 for his career, one
behind Jeff Trepagnier for second place on the all-time Trojan list.
Stais Boseman leads with 208. Granville is USC's career leader in
assists (677) and three-pointers (194).</TE>

<LD>* Men's basketball: Gonzaga at Pepperdine, 7:30 p.m., Friday. The
Waves meet the premier team in the West Coast Conference in a battle
for first place. Gonzaga is ranked 13th in the nation, the highest in
school history, and has an All-American candidate in senior guard Dan
Dickau. Pepperdine, which has won four in a row, has already defeated
No. 9 UCLA and No. 18 USC. The game is expected to be a sellout.</LD>
<LD>   * Men's and women's swimming: USC at UC Irvine, 1 p.m., Saturday.
The Trojans ranked 10th in both the men's and women's polls, face the
Anteaters in a nonconference dual meet. The Trojan men are led by
junior Erik Vendt, a silver medalist in the 400-meter intermediate
medley at the 2001 World Championships, and sophomore Klete Keller,
the defending 200-yard and 500-yard NCAA champion. The Irvine men
defeated UC San Diego last week, while the women lost to both Fresno
State and San Diego State.</LD>
<LD>   * Men's tennis: UC Santa Barbara at UCLA, L.A. Tennis Center, 1:30
p.m., Wednesday. The No. 3-ranked Bruins open their season against
the Gauchos, who went 6-17 in dual matches last season. Marcin
Matkowski and Jean-Julien Rojer are the top-ranked doubles team in
the nation, according to the Intercollegiate Tennis Assn. Both
players are also ranked in the top 20 in singles.</LD>

<HD>Acrylic Sculptures Popular With Crooks, Not Critics</HD>
<DH>Crime: 'Romantic Realist' pieces are being snatched from galleries
in the West, including one in Mission Viejo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sculptor Michael Wilkinson is hot. Or at least his work is, but not
the way he would prefer.</LD>
<LD>   Thieves have snatched acrylic sculptures by Wilkinson and works by
other artists from mall galleries and other outlets from Denver to
California, with 14 heists on the West Coast alone, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   And although critics are reserved in their estimate of the artistic
merit of the stolen art, law enforcement authorities say there appears to
be a ready market for the sculptures.</LD>
<TE>   "They may be linked to a large national ring," Orange County Sheriff's
Department spokesman Jim Amormino said of the thieves. "It's probably a
loose-knit group of thieves working together. Their methods are very
similar."</TE>
<TE>   The modus operandi sounds like two kids shoplifting candy. One of the
thieves distracts the gallery attendant while the other drapes a jacket
over the artwork and heads for the door, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very fast," Amormino said. "They want to get in and out real
quick."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, thieves in Los Angeles took off with a $3,200 Wilkinson
sculpture called "Crystal Fire" from the Henken Gallery in the New Otani
Hotel. That theft came two days after a $10,000 Wilkinson piece titled
"Moonscape II: Aria" was stolen from Mission Viejo's Kaleidoscope
Gallery. Wilkinson works in the "Romantic Realism" style and is
influenced by Ayn Rand.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second theft from the mall gallery in Mission Viejo. On
Dec. 20, two men rustled a 19-inch Jiang bronze horse valued at $12,500
out of the Kaleidoscope shop.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't afford it anymore, and I put in a security system," said
owner Ed Bolin, who said he opened the gallery in 1998 and had had items
stolen only twice before the Wilkinson theft.</TE>
<TE>   The two thieves, who were videotaped in the second Kaleidoscope theft,
also have struck in Long Beach, Beverly Hills and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "Moonscape II: Aria" is a 21-inch, see-through acrylic nude that
resembles an ice sculpture. Part of a limited edition of 500, the piece
is valued by the gallery at $10,000, although another dealer listed a
copy for $6,800.</TE>
<TE>   "They've taken stuff they can sell, and these sculptures are on the
high end of sculpture art," Bolin said. "So they have a good eye. They
must either have buyers in the business who are telling them what to
steal, or they know what art they can move and sell quickly."
Investigators believe the art might be destined for collectors in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Thieves also have been taking acrylic works by the late Fredrick Hart,
best-known for his bronze "Three Servicemen" statue at the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial wall in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The stolen art generally is dismissed by serious art fanciers.</TE>
<TE>   "Romantic Realism has an emotional, sublime quality to it," said
Martin Kersels, a sculptor, art instructor and California Institute of
the Arts art program director. "It can be nostalgic. In the contemporary
art world, Romantic Realism is not something people are aspiring to."</TE>
<TE>   The style was popular in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, but
not with contemporary artists because "it doesn't push the boundaries,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the majority of this style of art has no cultural currency,"
Kersels said. "It's not that interesting. . . . It's popular and
commercially profitable because people recognize the images; it's
nostalgic and it's not offensive.'</TE>
<TE>   On his Web site, Wilkinson describes his work as "rooted firmly in
realism that portrays the good and the beautiful in the human spirit--and
points to the glorious possibilities of our existence." The site also
describes Wilkinson as influenced by European classics and Japanese
architecture he observed when he was an Air Force illustrator.</TE>
<TE>   But the pieces have an audience among people drawn to mystical
overtones the artist combines with realistic--if idealized--human forms.</TE>
<TE>   "Wilkinson's work is sculpture--it's clear acrylic, so when you look
at it from different angles, there's a lot of different dimensions to
it," Bolin said. "It's men and women intertwined . . . in love and with a
child."</TE>
<TE>   While the critics might sniff, the pieces wouldn't be stolen if there
weren't a demand, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   "There tends to be a ready market for this," he said.</TE>

<HD>UCI Frat Suspended Amid Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Lawsuit: Student alleges hazing caused his grand mal seizure.
University to investigate Beta Theta Pi.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A UC Irvine fraternity has been suspended by its national
headquarters while it investigates a pledge's claim that he suffered a
grand mal seizure and was hospitalized following a weekend of hazing in
the Big Bear area.</LD>
<LD>   UCI, meanwhile, is conducting its own investigation of Beta Theta Pi
in connection with a lawsuit filed Nov. 28 by Jeff Warden, who said he
was forced to exercise in freezing temperatures and had beer forced down
his throat while being subjected to continuous verbal abuse during the
initiation in December 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Diane Kim, the campus director of student judicial affairs, said a
decision on whether to impose a penalty is expected by the end of the
month. Sanctions could include suspending the fraternity for an extended
period or making it the first Greek organization to be banned from UCI.</LD>
<TE>   Hazing is a misdemeanor under the state Education Code and is
punishable by fines of $50 to $5,000 or not more than a year in the
county jail. Kim also will decide whether to refer the matter to police,
said Randy Lewis, UCI's associate dean of students.</TE>
<TE>   Beta Theta Pi, which has had a chapter at UCI for 26 years, has a
reputation for being the top-ranked fraternity academically.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we're a bunch of smart guys who are good at sports," said
Edwin Steen, president of the fraternity. He declined to comment on the
incident other than to confirm that investigations are taking place. The
local chapter has not hired an attorney, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although hazing is prohibited by UCI, "it's hard to enforce," said
Paul Suhr, president of UCI's Interfraternity Council. Suhr said the
Betas had a good reputation among the 1,300 Greeks at UCI and those who
were unaffiliated. "They'd never had an incident like this, so it came as
a shock, as you can imagine," he said of the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Warden, 20, is a sophomore film studies major from Colorado Springs,
Colo., who wants to be a director. He received nearly straight As in high
school. He is close to 6 feet tall and thin, with spiked brown hair.</TE>
<TE>   Warden's suit, filed in Orange County Superior Court, seeks
unspecified monetary damages for assault, battery, intentional infliction
of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The
suit also names 13 Beta brothers as defendants.</TE>
<TE>   In describing the stay at Big Bear in an interview and in his lawsuit,
Warden tells a tale of 18- and 19-year-old pledges pushed so hard they
broke down in tears.</TE>
<TE>Snowboarding Wasn't on Weekend Agenda</TE>
<TE>   Warden said he was a prospective UCI student when he first heard of
the Betas. The fraternity mailed him a letter in Colorado, suggesting he
apply for its $500 scholarship. He didn't receive any money, but during
his interview, the Betas tried to recruit him.</TE>
<TE>   The newcomer from Colorado figured it was a way to meet people and
make friends. "Frats in my eyes were something good," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Once school started in the fall of 2000, Warden said he received bids
from three fraternities. He chose the Betas because of their small size,
about 23 members, their reputation for strong academics and assurances
that they didn't haze.</TE>
<TE>   Rush was in its final weekend on Dec. 8, 2000, when Warden and two
other pledges drove with about 15 fraternity members and alumni to a
group of cabins at Big Bear. Warden said he thought they were going
snowboarding.</TE>
<TE>   "They assured us we'd go up as pledges and come down as actives," he
said in an interview in his lawyer's Laguna Hills office.</TE>
<TE>   When the group arrived in Big Bear about midnight, Steen, then the
vice president, told pledges to hand over their cell phones and valuables
for safekeeping. The pledges were offered beer, and Warden said marijuana
was passed around.</TE>
<TE>   He said he didn't smoke and insisted on having a soft drink. As the
evening went on and Warden still refused to drink beer, fraternity
members chanted his name, "Jeff, Jeff, Jeff," so loudly that he couldn't
hear himself talk.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, two members picked him up and shoved the keg hose into his
mouth while the others counted to 20. "I tried not to swallow," Warden
said.</TE>
<TE>   What followed, Warden said, was a night of the fraternity members
imitating drill sergeants, yelling abuse at the pledges and forcing them
to stay up most of the night. Pillowcases were placed over their heads as
they were moved from cabins that were as hot as a sauna to those that
were unheated.</TE>
<TE>   After several hours, Warden broke down in tears. "I was scared," he
said. "I thought I was going to get hurt."</TE>
<TE>   When morning came, it was time for breakfast. Pledges each were handed
a cup filled with what Warden thinks were raw eggs and hot sauce. Next
came a main course of eggs--raw and scrambled, with green food coloring
added--that pledges were told to eat without using their hands. One
pledge objected, and a member pushed the youth's face into the plate,
Warden said.</TE>
<TE>   "It scared us," Warden said. "We knew if we didn't do it, we'd be
next."</TE>
<TE>   When they finished eating, pledges were ordered to hold Warden by the
legs and the head and use him as a human squeegee to clean the table,
Warden said.</TE>
<TE>   Then he was handed a mop and told to clean the floor. "I dropped the
mop. . . . I told them, 'That's not what we're here for.' I was confused
and furious at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   Warden said another drinking game began, and he was made to do
push-ups. By this time, he said he was so tired, he could barely finish
one. As he lay on the ground, he said, he was forced to join in a
simulated sex act with the two other pledges.</TE>
<TE>   When he got up, Warden said, he told the frat members he didn't feel
well and went outside for a few minutes. When he returned to the cabin,
he felt his field of vision constricting.</TE>
<TE>   "I was coherent, and then I wasn't," Warden said. "I could feel
something happen to me."</TE>
<TE>   The next thing he remembered he was in leg and arm restraints at Bear
Valley Community Hospital, he said. A nurse asked him if he knew where he
was. He said, "Colorado."</TE>
<TE>   He was diagnosed with having had a grand mal seizure. Warden said he
never experienced one before and hasn't had one since. Members and
pledges told him he had been foaming at the mouth, and his eyes rolled
back in his head.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital records show Warden was admitted to the hospital Saturday,
Dec. 9, at 9 p.m. and released the next day, although the release time
wasn't noted, his attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   Fraternity members took him from the hospital and dropped him off at
his aunt's house in San Juan Capistrano.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, Warden's temperature hit 101.5 degrees, and he went
to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he was subjected to a battery of
tests, which turned up no abnormalities.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the seizure, Warden said, his driver's license was revoked
until August, and he had to rely on friends to take him to his job at
Disneyland and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Betas told him not to tell anyone what had happened because the
fraternity would get into trouble, he said. They left phone messages
asking him to come to meetings. Several members even told him his
initiation was easier than theirs.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he had had enough of the Greek life. He avoided fraternity
members for the rest of the school year. Over the summer, he said he
considered transferring but decided that would only mean those who had
hurt him would win.</TE>
<TE>   This fall, he reported the Big Bear events to a campus ombudsman. "He
said I definitely had a case, and I should get counseling and get a
lawyer, and he'd notify the school."</TE>
<TE>'I Thought They Stood for Brotherhood . . .'</TE>
<TE>   Warden said that originally he didn't plan to sue. The fraternity had
assured him they would pay the $10,000 in medical bills. But they paid
him only $3,000 and he was worried his credit rating would suffer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of sad," Warden said. "My whole view of fraternities has
changed. "I thought they stood for brotherhood, friendship and people
you'd know for life."</TE>
<TE>   Most U.S. colleges have antihazing rules, as do more than 40 states.
California's Education Code prohibits activities including "creation of
excessive fatigue; physical and psychological shocks; encouraging,
forcing or coercing the use of alcohol and/or controlled substances;
morally degrading or humiliating games and activities. . . ."</TE>
<TE>   "All of us in educational institutions emphasize over and over again
it's against the law," said John Williamson, executive vice president of
the North American Interfraternity Conference, which represents 66
fraternities on 800 campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Olver, a spokesman for the Beta's national office in Oxford, Ohio,
said his office didn't learn of the allegations until the lawsuit was
filed, nearly a year after the incident. By taking so long to report the
event to the national office, the UCI chapter appears to have violated
the fraternity's rules. Beta policy requires chapters to report serious
problems to the national office within 48 hours, Olver said.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly a kid being hospitalized would qualify," he said. Olver
declined to comment on the suit.</TE>

<HD>Critics Question Legality of County Talks</HD>
<DH>Government: Retreat may break open meetings law, watchdogs say.
Officials deny business is being done.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sixty-five top government leaders from Orange County, including
three county supervisors, have been at a Lake Arrowhead lodge holding a
three-day leadership conference that critics say may violate the state's
open-meetings law.</LD>
<LD>   The $65,000 event, co-sponsored by eight public agencies, is at the
UCLA Conference Center, a San Bernardino Mountain lodge that was home to
the Yacht Club of Lake Arrowhead in the 1950s. The conference ends today.</LD>
<LD>   Of the agencies represented, five have had a majority of voting
members present--including the Board of Supervisors, according to a
participant roster.</LD>
<TE>   Only one agency, the Orange County Fire Authority, posted any public
notice about the Orange County Leadership Symposium, issuing a Dec. 31
press release that said 125 elected officials were invited to address
"future countywide issues."</TE>
<TE>   That didn't satisfy Terry Francke, general counsel for the California
First Amendment Coalition in Sacramento, an advocacy group for open
government.</TE>
<TE>   Francke said the state's public meetings law, the Ralph M. Brown Act,
clearly states that any meeting attended by a board majority of a
government agency must be publicized in advance by each entity involved.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders at the Lake Arrowhead symposium said the conference was exempt
from the public meetings law because no specific official matters were
discussed, only general topics.</TE>
<TE>   But Francke said that although the law permits some unofficial
gatherings, such as out-of-county conferences, that applies only if the
event is held for the public's benefit. Even then, the law forbids
leaders from discussing government business with a majority of their
board, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "In this case, I really can't imagine what would be more public or
more interactive," he said. "This is not private business."</TE>
<TE>   Representatives from several of the agencies said the Lake Arrowhead
symposium didn't qualify as an official public meeting. It wasn't subject
to the Brown Act because the public could attend and official business
wasn't to be discussed, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "From our reading of the Brown Act and our understanding of the event,
we did not think it was necessary to put out a notice," said George Urch,
spokesman for the Orange County Transportation Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Eight members of the 11-member transportation board attended,
including one alternate and one nonvoting member.</TE>
<TE>   Among conference participants who attended with a majority of their
fellow board members were: Three of five county supervisors, including
Supervisors Jim Silva, Todd Spitzer and Tom Wilson; eight of 15 members
of the Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency; 17 of 24 members
of the Orange County Fire Authority, including four alternate members;
and eight of 11 members of the Local Agency Formation Commission,
including two alternates.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from three other agencies attended, but not in numbers that
constituted board majorities. They included four members of the 13-member
San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency, eight members of the
25-member Orange County Sanitation District, and seven of the 39-member
local chapter of the League of California Cities.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining attendees were three city managers and several staff
members. Some of the elected officials attending serve on two or more of
the agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Clare Climaco, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Corridor Agencies,
said the Arrowhead symposium was announced at recent toll road board
meetings, but no written notice was issued to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "They are talking about leadership development and organizational
development," Climaco said. "They are focusing on leadership skills. They
were not taking action on anything."</TE>
<TE>   Terry Andrus, general counsel for the Orange County Fire Authority,
could not be reached for comment Monday. But in a memo to Fire Chief Chip
Prather in August, Andrus addressed whether the Arrowhead conference
complied with the Brown Act if majorities of legislative bodies attended.</TE>
<TE>   Andrus wrote that the meeting could be held outside Orange County as
long as it was open to the public. He noted, however, that if no public
agency had a majority of its lawmakers present, the open meetings laws
would not apply.</TE>
<TE>   Among those attending the three-day symposium was Debbie Cook, mayor
of Huntington Beach and a new member of the Orange County Sanitation
District. She said the discussions focused on esoteric issues of
leadership, not specific issues. The only time specifics were discussed,
such as the fate of the El Toro Marine base, came "as examples where
mistakes have been made in leadership," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "People felt there was a benefit to getting outside the area, to get
away and reflect on what they're doing," Cook said.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Orange County government watchdog Shirley Grindle said the
agencies were "playing with fire" by not organizing a truly public event
and for meeting so far from the county.</TE>
<TE>   "The course they should be taking is ethics in government," she said.</TE>

<CX>   Lake Arrowhead retreat--A story Tuesday incorrectly implied that
the Orange County Fire Authority used a press release to notify the
public of a leadership retreat held in Lake Arrowhead. In fact, the fire
authority also issued a separate public notification of the 2 1/2-day
meeting that began Jan. 13 and was attended by 17 of the agency's 24
members.</CX>

<LD>A 2-year-old girl was reunited with her mother Monday after police
conducted a four-hour door-to-door search near an Anaheim elementary
school where she had been found wandering alone.</LD>
<LD>   Police are trying to determine if the owner of a neighborhood day-care
center watching the child was neglectful, said Jim Amormino, a spokesman
for the Orange County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   "It appears that the mother dropped her off at the day-care center and
somehow the child wandered off," he said.</LD>
<TE>   About 11:15 a.m., another parent noticed the toddler--identified only
as Eilene--wandering alone in front of Salk Elementary School in the 1400
block of Gilbert Street.</TE>
<TE>   The mystery was solved several hours later when a girl of about 12
approached one of the officers and said she had been baby-sitting the
child at the home-based center in the 9800 block of Harriet Lane in an

<HD>Concordia Studying Separate Business School</HD>
<DH>Education: Reflecting student needs, the Lutheran university in
Irvine mulls expansion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concordia University has taken a step toward launching a separate
business school that would double the number of students who leave the
Irvine campus with a graduate or undergraduate degree in the discipline.</LD>
<LD>   The university's regents agreed at their December meeting that
officials should continue studying the feasibility of a school of
business, campus officials announced Monday. The regents are scheduled to
vote on a proposal in March.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Christensen, Concordia's executive vice president for university
advancement, said a new school would respond to student demand. About 40%
of the Lutheran university's students become teachers. A survey of the
1,500-student campus showed that another 40% of undergraduates want to go
into business, Christensen said.</LD>
<TE>   At present, there are 172 undergraduate business majors and 40 people
enrolled in the master of business administration program.</TE>
<TE>   "It won't be for everyone," he said. "Our focus is on a value-centered
education, one centered on integrity. We're a Christian university, so
we're going to take a Christian approach."</TE>
<TE>   Existing business schools in Orange County include ones based at UC
Irvine, Chapman University, Azusa Pacific University and Pepperdine
University.</TE>
<TE>   Concordia's business school would cost an estimated $8 million to $10
million for a building, plus another $2 million for endowed faculty
chairs and scholarships, Christensen said.</TE>

<HD>Landing Gear Fails but Pilot Doesn't</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Laguna Niguel man's commuting flight turns into an
exercise in keeping his composure when his plane malfunctions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES SYTAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was supposed to be a normal flight to work Monday for Robert
Owen: a 21-minute glide in the air to Van Nuys, where he is an executive
for a manufacturer of food cans.</LD>
<LD>   But the landing gear on his 1983 Mooney failed, forcing him to head
back to John Wayne Airport. His plane skidded to a halt on the runway,
and Owen escaped injury.</LD>
<LD>   "I was never worried about my safety," said Owen, 57, of Laguna
Niguel, the sole occupant of the plane.</LD>
<TE>   As he has done almost every working day for five years, Owen, a
licensed pilot for 30 years who has logged more than 3,000 flying hours,
opted to fly rather than drive to work in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   Before his departure, Owen checked the engine and pumped in 60 gallons
of fuel. The ride was smooth until he prepared to land at Van Nuys
Airport. A flashing light warned him there was a problem with the left
landing gear.</TE>
<TE>   Owen, who also is a flying instructor, returned to John Wayne Airport
and circled at 140 mph for more than two hours to get rid of fuel that
weighed down the aircraft and might explode if the landing were
difficult, according to Christie McDaniel, airport spokeswoman. As Owen
landed at 8:30 a.m., the left wheel collapsed, and the plane swerved and
hit runway lights.</TE>
<TE>   "I was never afraid," he said. "As long as you keep your composure,
you'll keeping flying the plane and you'll land safely."</TE>
<TE>   The incident caused about $10,000 in damage.</TE>

<HD>Poll Finds Terror Attacks Eroded Airport Support</HD>
<DH>El Toro: In all, 56% support Measure W's call for park zoning,
according to a Chapman University survey.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The September terrorist attacks slightly eroded support for
building an airport at the abandoned El Toro Marine base, according to a
Chapman University survey released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Of the 1,092 people polled at the end of November, 13% said the
attacks had influenced their position on El Toro. Of those, a strong
majority--70%--said they were "less likely" to back an airport.</LD>
<LD>   In all, 56% said they support Measure W, a ballot measure calling for
a large park and other development rather than an airport, said Fred
Smoller, director of the Henley Social Sciences Research Laboratory at
Chapman University in Orange. The survey questioned Orange County adults
about the effects of the Sept. 11 attacks on their lives.</LD>
<TE>   Measure W, if approved by voters in the March 5 primary election,
would replace airport zoning at the 4,700-acre former Marine base with
zoning for an urban park, university complex and sports fields.</TE>
<TE>   About a quarter of those surveyed said they would oppose a huge park,
but a significant portion --18%--said they didn't know.</TE>
<TE>   Smoller said the attacks' effect on public opinion could be
significant. In a close race on Measure W, he said, "these small
percentages could take center stage."</TE>
<TE>   "It's one more nail in the coffin of El Toro," Smoller said. "[The
attacks] only made things worse for the people who want an airport.
Basically the survey said 70% of the 13% were pushed in one direction,
against the airport. "</TE>
<TE>   The poll, however, was not limited to the opinions of Orange County
voters. It is unclear how many of those surveyed are registered voters or
likely to vote.</TE>
<TE>   That led a pro-airport spokesman to reject the findings on the
airport.</TE>
<TE>   "Polling nonvoters is an irrelevant exercise because they will not be
able to register their opinions on election day," said David Ellis of the
pro-El Toro Airport Working Group of Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The survey, sponsored by the Mark Chapin Johnson Foundation, polled
1,092 residents between Nov. 14 and Dec. 1. The poll has a margin of
error for the total sample of plus or minus 3 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   On other issues involving the terrorist attacks, the poll found that
92% of those surveyed approved of President Bush's job performance in the
weeks after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   About 57% of those polled supported monitoring of personal phone
calls, e-mails and credit card purchases under the recent federal
anti-terrorism legislation. About 37% oppose or strongly oppose the new
laws, and 5% don't know.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the poll shows that the attacks have not divided the
county along racial and ethnic lines. Asked whether residents have become
suspicious of people who appear to be of Middle Eastern descent, 73% said
no. And 69% said they would not be uncomfortable flying if they saw
someone who appeared to be of Middle Eastern descent on the plane.</TE>

<HD>Judge Denies Plea to Dismiss Burbank Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge Monday rejected a plea by the
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority to dismiss a lawsuit naming
it as the defendant in a case designed to clarify the validity of an
anti-airport-expansion law.</LD>
<LD>   Burbank filed suit against the authority last fall asking the court to
clarify if the city has the legal ability to enforce Measure A. The law
prohibits the City Council from approving any airport construction or
renovation unless certain conditions are met, including flight caps, a
flight curfew, an environmental impact report and a master plan.</LD>
<LD>   It also prevents the airport from adding runways or lengthening
existing ones and requires approval by two-thirds of Burbank voters
before a terminal may be built.</LD>
<TE>   City officials have said the law puts Burbank in "an impossible
position" because it contains terms and conditions that may violate state
and local law and the California Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   The authority countersued, asking a judge to dismiss the suit because
it also questions the measure's legitimacy, spokesman Victor Gill said.
For that reason, airport officials will not provide a defense.</TE>
<TE>   A better defendant, the authority argued, would be Restore Our Airport
Rights, the group that supports Measure A, which Burbank voters approved
in October.</TE>
<TE>   Denying the authority's position, the judge set a court hearing for
April 17.</TE>

<LD>A former high school sports standout was sentenced to four years in
state prison Monday after pleading guilty to kicking another teen to
death at a party in Palmdale in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Marcus Anthony Raines, 18, and another Littlerock High School athlete
beat and kicked Christopher O'Leary, 19, after they knocked him to the
ground during a fight. Raines, an all-star linebacker and hurdler, had
won two medals in a high school track competition hours before the May 19
beating. O'Leary died three days later.</LD>
<LD>   Raines' teammate Richard Lee Newton, 18, earlier pleaded no contest to
assault and was sentenced to four years in state prison. Rodney Woods,
19, a son of the school's track coach, pleaded no contest to assault of a
second man who was beaten at the party.</LD>
<TE>   Woods was ordered to serve a year in county jail and five years'
probation.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Newton punched O'Leary in the face, causing him to
fall and hit his head on the pavement. Once O'Leary was down, Raines
kicked him in the head.</TE>

<HD>Art That's Alluring--to Thieves</HD>
<DH>Crime: The critics may disagree, but 14 heists on the West Coast
mean there's a market for the works being stolen.</DH>

<LD>Sculptor Michael Wilkinson is hot. Or at least his work is, but not
the way he would prefer.</LD>
<LD>   Thieves have been spiriting acrylic sculptures by Wilkinson and works
by other artists out of mall galleries and other commercial outlets from
Denver to California, with 14 heists on the West Coast alone, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   And while critics are reserved, authorities say there appears to be a
ready market for the sculptures.</LD>
<TE>   The thieves "may be linked to a large national ring," Orange County
Sheriff's Department spokesman Jim Amormino said. "It's probably a
loose-knit group of thieves working together. Their methods are very
similar."</TE>
<TE>   The modus operandi sounds like two kids shoplifting candy. One thief
distracts the gallery attendant while the other drapes a jacket over the
artwork and heads for the door, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very fast," Amormino said. "They want to get in and out real
quick."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, thieves took a $3,200 Wilkinson sculpture--"Crystal
Fire"--from the Henken Gallery in the New Otani Hotel in Los Angeles. Two
days later, a $10,000 Wilkinson piece titled "Moonscape II: Aria" was
stolen from Mission Viejo's Kaleidoscope Gallery. It was the second theft
from the mall gallery in Mission Viejo. On Dec. 20, two men rustled a
19-inch Jiang bronze horse valued at $12,500 out of the shop.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't afford it anymore and I put in a security system," said
owner Ed Bolin, who opened the gallery in 1998 and had been victimized
only twice before the Wilkinson thefts.</TE>
<TE>   Thieves, who were captured on videotape in the second Kaleidoscope
theft, also have struck in Long Beach and Beverly Hills, and as far north
as San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "Moonscape II: Aria" is a 21-inch, see-through acrylic nude that
resembles an ice sculpture. Part of a limited edition of 500, the gallery
valued the piece at $10,000, although another dealer listed a copy for
$6,800.</TE>
<TE>   "They've taken stuff they can sell, and these sculptures are on the
high end of sculpture art," Bolin said. "So they have a good eye. They
must either have buyers in the business who are telling them what to
steal, or they know what art they can move and sell quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Thieves also have been targeting acrylic works by the late Fredrick
Hart, best-known for his bronze "Three Servicemen" statue at the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The stolen art generally is dismissed by serious art critics.
Wilkinson's work is in the Romantic Realism style and influenced by Ayn
Rand.</TE>
<TE>   "Romantic Realism has an emotional, sublime quality to it," said
Martin Kersels, a sculptor, art instructor and California Institute of
the Arts art program director. "It can be nostalgic. In the contemporary
art world, Romantic Realism is not something people are aspiring to."</TE>
<TE>   The style was popular in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, but
it has fallen into insignificance because "it doesn't push the
boundaries," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the majority of this style of art has no cultural currency,"
Kersels said. "It's popular and commercially profitable because people
recognize the images, it's nostalgic, and it's not offensive."</TE>
<TE>   On his Web site, Wilkinson, a New York artist, describes his work as
"rooted firmly in realism that portrays the good and the beautiful in the
human spirit--and points to the glorious possibilities of our existence."
The site describes Wilkinson as being influenced by European classics and
Japanese architecture he saw as an Air Force illustrator.</TE>
<TE>   The pieces have an audience among people drawn to mystical overtones
the artists place on realistic--if idealized--human forms.</TE>
<TE>   "Wilkinson's work is sculpture--it's clear acrylic so when you look at
it from different angles, there's a lot of different dimensions to it,"
Bolin said. "It's men and women intertwined . . . in love and with a
child."</TE>
<TE>   While the critics might sniff, the pieces wouldn't get stolen if there
weren't demand, Amormino said. Investigators believe the art might be
destined for Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "There tends to be a ready market for this," he said.</TE>

<HD>Olympic Torch Heats Up Tiny Town's Spirit</HD>
<DH>Games: By Salt Lake City, the flame will have traveled more than
13,500 miles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JACUMBA, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>Jochen Tartak didn't sweat it Monday when he carried the Olympic
flame across the desert and into California. After all, he had a police
escort as he hit 70 mph at the state line.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Hoffman didn't sweat it, either, when he carried the Olympic torch
down this mountain hamlet's main street at about 5 mph. He had two dozen
kids ready to catch him if he stumbled.</LD>
<LD>   Hoffman, 47, a school janitor from El Cajon, was California's first
real torchbearer as promoters of the Winter Games brought the Olympic
torch relay to the state for a weeklong run.</LD>
<TE>   "Run" may be a bit of an exaggeration. Torch-carrying runners will
cover only about 20% of the 1,167 miles through California that the
Olympic flame will travel by next Monday. Fire-breathing machines such as
Tartak's pickup truck will handle the rest.</TE>
<TE>   By plane, boat, dog sled, snowmobile and truck, the flame lighted Nov.
19 in Olympia, Greece, is meandering across the country on its way to
Salt Lake City. By the time it gets there Feb. 8, it will have traveled
more than 13,500 miles, carried by 11,500 torchbearers. Make that 11,550,
counting Tartak and his fire-handling co-workers.</TE>
<TE>   If relays of runners were to carry the torch every step of the way, it
would take 375 days to make the Winter Games' trek instead of the 65 that
organizers have allocated. And that's if the torches were passed nonstop,
from sunrise to sunset.</TE>
<TE>   The flame will flare from a propane-fueled burner on the back of a
pickup truck for part of today's trip from San Diego to Los
Angeles--primarily between Laguna Beach and Newport Beach and between
Costa Mesa and Los Angeles' Olvera Street, relay officials said. A truck
will also be used to carry the flame on a leg of the trip this evening to
Universal City.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's relay started with the flame delivered on a train's flatcar
to 10 runners who carried it two miles through Yuma, Ariz. From there was
the high-speed dash across the desert and into California--where driver
Tartak, a 30-year-old North Carolinian, barely slowed down for the state
agricultural inspection station.</TE>
<TE>   But things came to a stop in Jacumba, a town of 400 people, three
churches and half a dozen businesses. Relay organizers let five runners
carry torches down Old Highway 80, the main drag.</TE>
<TE>   The whole town lined the street to cheer Hoffman, and then Alan
Lerchbacker, 49, of Pasadena; Carol Regaldo, 16, of Jacumba; David Riggs,
28, of San Diego; and Crystal Fernando, 39, of San Marcos.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic relay organizers have a soft spot in their hearts for this San
Diego County town, which is nestled against the U.S.-Mexico border. In
1996, the Summer Games' relay passed through Jacumba. When one of that
year's relay runners failed to show up, student Fred Zavala, 13, stepped
forward to take his place.</TE>
<TE>   "It was such a moment that year. All 50 kids in the Jacumba School
were out cheering with paper torches they'd made. Here we were in this
little jewel in the desert. There are several of us here this year who
remember this place from last time," relay worker Cheryl Cagle said.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the schoolchildren serenaded the runners and relay workers
with "God Bless America" and served them Krispy Kreme doughnuts they had
fetched from 60 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Teenage runner Carol--who was nominated to be a torchbearer by the
children because of her volunteer work as an after-school tutor to
younger pupils--was given her torch to keep by officials who ordinarily
offer them for sale at $335 apiece. Regaldo promptly donated it to the
school.</TE>
<TE>   Pupils from Hoffman's Dehesa School high-fived their janitor. They had
written letters of recommendation that helped him win a spot in the
relay. "If he had dropped the torch I'd have picked it up for him," said
fourth-grader Scott Ybarrondo.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the biggest thing that has ever happened to us," said
Kimberly Jump, 45, a bartender who lives in a trailer at the edge of
town. "People don't usually find us. We're off the beaten track."</TE>
<TE>   Torch relay spokesman Ahmad Corbitt said the relay passes through
towns smaller than Jacumba. But it's the smallest place flame carriers
are actually running through.</TE>
<TE>   Lots of bigger places can't hold a torch to big-hearted Jacumba.</TE>

<HD>Riordan's Campaign Atypical for Republican</HD>
<DH>Primary: Some say the gubernatorial candidate's liberal stance
could work against him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In West Hollywood, Republican gubernatorial candidate Richard
Riordan tells a gay and lesbian group that he might support the kind of
same-sex unions legalized in Vermont.</LD>
<LD>   In Oakland, he tells a minority civil rights group that he will
"embarrass" the Bush administration if that's what it takes to get health
care money for impoverished Californians. Leaders, Riordan says, must ask
themselves every day, "What's in the interest of the poor?"</LD>
<LD>   It's a decidedly unorthodox approach to a Republican primary.</LD>
<TE>   Riordan's leftward tilt on social issues could attract moderates and
independents in a general election contest against incumbent Democrat
Gray Davis in November, strategists say. But the former Los Angeles mayor
risks a backlash by conservative voters in the March 5 primary and
beyond.</TE>
<TE>   "It's astounding," said Dick Dresner, a longtime pollster for former
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. "How do you run on gay rights and things
like that in a Republican primary? It makes no sense."</TE>
<TE>   To the Riordan campaign, its eye on November, the strategy fits both
the candidate and the state's moderate bent.</TE>
<TE>   He has not ignored issues popular with conservatives: So far Riordan
has focused largely on fiscal management, public safety and education
reform. He has also campaigned in some traditional Republican venues like
the Kern County Fair's Salute to Agriculture in Bakersfield. On Monday,
at the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, he proposed cutting the
sales tax on manufacturing equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Riordan's first television commercial does not mention that he's a
Republican; instead, it describes him as "nonpartisan."</TE>
<TE>   On the campaign trail, Riordan calls Davis "my opponent"--as if the
March 5 primary were finished business. Riordan rarely mentions his GOP
rivals, California Secretary of State Bill Jones and financier Bill Simon
Jr. of Pacific Palisades. He avoids responding when the Jones and Simon
campaigns attack.</TE>
<TE>   "We're strong believers in the 11th commandment: Don't criticize and
take on your fellow Republicans," said Riordan campaign manager Ron
Hartwig.</TE>
<TE>   But to Dresner and other veterans of California politics, Riordan's
campaign stops last week in West Hollywood and Oakland signaled that he's
taking the primary for granted, a potentially dangerous mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "He's sending a message to the Republican base: Make sure you come out
and vote against me," Dresner said.</TE>
<TE>   For Riordan, the approach has been made easier by his standing in the
race. Jones and Simon seem to be a better ideological fit with the
state's activist conservative Republicans--both, unlike Riordan, oppose
abortion rights and gun control.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, they have trailed Riordan in fund-raising and the polls.
Multimillionaire Simon, though, could still self-finance a competitive
television campaign. His showcase supporter, former New York City Mayor
Rudy Giuliani, is expected to campaign with him in California on Thursday
and may appear in Simon's ads.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who has no personal fortune to tap, has relied on news coverage
of his aggressive attacks on Riordan and, more recently, Davis. Jones has
repeatedly argued that Riordan's close ties to Democrats make him unfit
for the Republican nomination. Riordan advisors say the Jones attacks
could actually help the former mayor if he wins the nomination.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows Democrats and independents that Riordan is a problem solver
first and a partisan second," said Riordan political director Kevin
Spillane.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's approach is similar to that of former Gov. Wilson, whose
appeals to women and moderates also drew consternation from the party's
conservatives. But Wilson also championed issues important to
conservatives and other voters, such as strong anti-crime measures and
his controversial but winning stance against illegal immigration.</TE>
<TE>   "The winning path is economic conservatism and social moderation,"
said political scientist Bruce Cain of UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   The question is whether, in treading that path, Riordan goes too far
for his own party's voters.</TE>
<TE>Candidate Calls Prop. 22 'Divisive'</TE>
<TE>   In West Hollywood on Wednesday, Riordan told members of ANGLE--Access
Now for Gay and Lesbian Equality--that he hoped "to create a Republican
Party that is inclusive."</TE>
<TE>   "Over the course of this campaign, I am going to work hard to give
women, Latinos, and gay and lesbian voters a real alternative," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan recalled that he opposed the Proposition 22 initiative against
gay marriages. He called it "an unnecessary and divisive measure that
singled out gays and lesbians for discrimination." Riordan also said he
would consider the possibility of supporting same-sex civil unions "as
openly as everything."</TE>
<TE>   A few hours later, Riordan again called for a more "inclusive" party
in a visit with Republican women in Pomona. But the dissonance of his
message among conservative GOP primary voters was apparent when Norco
housewife Kaye O'Mara, 55, said she associates "inclusive" with liberals.</TE>
<TE>   "When you say we need to be inclusive, do you mean we have to give up
our values?" she asked the candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely not," Riordan replied. "It means you have to respect other
people's point of view."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's chief strategist, Sal Russo, said Riordan's events in West
Hollywood and Oakland were signs of "an extraordinarily dangerous
strategy" for a GOP primary.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not appealing to centrist, moderate Reagan Democrats," Russo
said. "They're appealing to the most liberal Democrats."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, he said, is "sticking it to the conservative base in the
party."</TE>
<TE>   In Oakland on Thursday, Riordan attended the annual dinner of the
Greenlining Institute, an advocacy group for civil rights and economic
development in poor and minority neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   At the dais table with Riordan were two of Northern California's
best-known liberal Democrats, Rep. Barbara Lee of Oakland and state
Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco. The institute was honoring
Lee with its 2002 "Profile in Courage" award partly because she cast the
only vote in Congress against a military response to the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech, Burton trumpeted his proposal to increase taxes on the
rich. When he promised to protect the poor from state budget cuts,
Riordan put down his silverware and applauded. After Burton's speech,
Riordan threw an arm around the senator's shoulder and posed for
photographs.</TE>
<TE>   The theme of Riordan's speech was "empowerment."</TE>
<TE>   "I want every Californian--no matter their gender, race, creed, color
or sexual orientation--to have proper housing, adequate health care and a
secure knowledge that the justice system is blind," Riordan told the
mainly black, Latino and Asian audience.</TE>
<TE>   To get health care money for the poor, he said he would "even
embarrass our federal government if I have to."</TE>
<TE>   Sean Walsh, policy director of Jones' campaign, said Riordan's stop at
the Oakland dinner "sends a good signal that Republicans care about
issues important to minorities in California." Nonetheless, he questioned
whether the institute was a suitable group for a GOP candidate to court.</TE>
<TE>Riordan's Approach Termed Ignorant</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people that support that tend to be the Maxine Waters of the
world who go out and say unkind things about Republicans," Walsh said.</TE>
<TE>   Garry South, chief strategist for the Davis' reelection effort, said
Riordan's approach to the primary showed his "arrogance and ignorance"
about California politics.</TE>
<TE>   "To just go out there and poke sticks in the eyes of the voters he's
going to have to count on to win a partisan primary defies logic," South
said.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, though, said he was simply addressing "issues I very much
care about."</TE>

<HD>Gaining Clout and a Riskier Standing</HD>
<DH>Politics: Billboard industry wants political contributions to pay
off in a law allowing giant signs along L.A. freeways. Its higher profile
could backfire, critics say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a billboard company recently installed signs along Los Angeles
area freeways without city approval, it not only angered local officials,
but also threatened to undo a two-year campaign by the industry to
increase its influence at City Hall.</LD>
<LD>   During that period, billboard companies contributed tens of thousands
of dollars to candidates for local elected office. They provided
candidates and council members with free advertising on their huge signs.</LD>
<LD>   And their efforts in last year's city elections were widely credited
with helping Rocky Delgadillo capture the city attorney's office,
creating complications for Delgadillo, who now has the task of dealing
with his benefactors in legal disputes.</LD>
<TE>   Having emerged from last year's elections with a new sense of
influence, the companies are now protective of their standing.</TE>
<TE>   So when a Viacom subsidiary caused a ruckus earlier this month by
installing billboards on Metropolitan Transportation Authority property
before new restrictions kicked in New Year's Day, a coalition of
competing billboard companies was quick to disavow the action.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom forced the subsidiary to reconsider, and the billboards will
come down. Other firms, meanwhile, hope the flap won't derail their most
important goal: winning City Council and mayoral support for a new
ordinance that would, for the first time in decades, let them erect giant
billboards along Los Angeles area freeways.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be the billboard industry would make a few campaign
contributions, and that was it," said veteran political consultant Rick
Taylor. "But now we are seeing huge financial commitments to candidates.
Whatever is on the line for them, it must be far bigger than any of us
realized, particularly for the large billboards along major streets."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, millions of dollars are at stake. One freeway sign can
generate up to $90,000 a month in revenue--10 times more than a billboard
perched atop a liquor store in some of the city's residential areas.</TE>
<TE>   Billboard owners' newfound power and prominence is not without its
risks. Delgadillo said he feels burdened by the industry's generous
campaign support. And some City Hall insiders--including the companies'
lobbyist--said the firms subject themselves to greater scrutiny and a
potential political backlash.</TE>
<TE>   "My advice to the owners is to just stay out of it," said the
lobbyist, Ken Spiker Jr.</TE>
<TE>   But Ed Dato, director of public affairs at Clear Channel, a large
multimedia corporation, said the billboard companies want to participate
in the political process. "We feel we have the right to endorse people
too," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For years, billboards have been a major point of controversy in Los
Angeles as a proliferation of signs forced city officials to wrestle with
new regulations. The council has tried to limit alcohol and tobacco ads
near schools, while placing a moratorium on new permits for billboards
anywhere in the city.</TE>
<TE>   The moves were intended to give officials time to come up with
restrictions that would help reduce visual blight and put teeth into
efforts to remove illegal billboards and signs.</TE>
<TE>   The billboard companies--including Clear Channel Communications, Eller
Media Co. and Regency Outdoor Advertising--responded with a proposal to
take down 1,400 of Los Angeles' 9,700 signs in exchange for the right to
put up 70 two-sided billboards in industrial zones along freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas drafted the ordinance and is the city's
most vocal proponent of the deal because, he said, it will give Los
Angeles a chance to finally get rid of billboard blight in residential
areas.</TE>
<TE>   "The proposed ordinance is reasonable," said Ridley-Thomas, who has
received $1,500 in campaign contributions from billboard companies in the
last two years.</TE>
<TE>   The measure--set for council debate this spring--is so important to
billboard firms that they have offered Spiker, one of the city's top
lobbyists, a bonus of up to $1 million if he is able to secure
legislation overturning the freeway ban. Spiker also represents the
industry on a committee that is reviewing the city's laws regarding signs
and will make recommendations to the council.</TE>
<TE>   Further raising the stakes, the billboard companies--most of them
publicly traded, multinational corporations--have stepped up their giving
to public officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Follow the money," Taylor said. "They clearly want to help people who
they think will help them."</TE>
<TE>   For example:</TE>
<TE>   * In the 2000 primary and general elections, Regency and Eller
provided $686,000 worth of billboard space in support of future Mayor
James K. Hahn and Delgadillo as part of their own independent effort.
Because these expenditures are not coordinated with the candidates'
campaigns, they are not limited by campaign contribution laws.</TE>
<TE>   * Fifteen companies have given more than $100,000 to candidates for
city offices since the council began considering the freeway sign
ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   * In the council's 2nd District race, where Assemblyman Tony Cardenas
and Wendy Greuel are locked in battle, Clear Channel has given $50,000
worth of sign space to both candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the smaller, yet noticeable, favors.</TE>
<TE>   When a friend of Councilman Dennis Zine recently wanted the lawmaker's
name stripped across a patriotic billboard in his district, Clear Channel
quickly agreed. The "God Bless America" sign on Ventura Boulevard at
Shoup Street includes Zine's name and his Superman logo.</TE>
<TE>   "They asked for the sign and we said, 'Yeah, we can do that,' " said
Clear Channel's Dato. "It's a public service. Everyone was in the mood
for it right after 9/11."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Vista Media--acting at the request of Councilman Nick
Pacheco--agreed to donate 60 billboards as part of an anti-gun violence
campaign to be unveiled next week.</TE>
<TE>   Spiker said the companies began capitalizing on their unique
asset--free billboard space--last year. Clear Channel took the lead, by
striking out against billboard adversary Councilman Mike Feuer.</TE>
<TE>   Months before entering the 2000 race for city attorney, Feuer
criticized the proposed freeway sign ordinance, because he wanted safety
studies done to ensure that billboards would not distract motorists.</TE>
<TE>   His concerns did not stop there. He also drafted an ordinance that
banned alcohol and tobacco billboards near schools in Los Angeles. (A
similar Massachusetts law was recently deemed unconstitutional, making it
unlikely that Los Angeles will try to enforce the new law.)</TE>
<TE>   Before Feuer's race was over, Eller Media had jumped in and spent
about $300,000 supporting Delgadillo, mostly in free billboard space.
Regency similarly spent $125,000. Employees for the billboard companies
also dug deep into their pockets, giving $8,250 in personal contributions
to Delgadillo.</TE>
<TE>   "The message to public officials is: They ought to be very careful
about crossing billboard companies," Feuer said. "If they get involved
with a large-scale fight with the billboard industry, there will be
meaningful consequences, and careers will be at stake."</TE>
<TE>   Although Delgadillo benefited from the support, the new city attorney
said the billboard industry's backing has become "the bane of my
existence."</TE>
<TE>   He now faces an uphill battle to prove to the public that he is not
beholden to the companies.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure it hasn't hurt as much as it was intended to help," said
Delgadillo, adding that he never asked the industry for its support.</TE>
<TE>   If anything, a spokesman for the city attorney said, the billboard
industry's generous public support of candidates could backfire.</TE>
<TE>   "In general, entities that play the game of contributing money in
exchange for influence . . . are more effective when there is less public
scrutiny," said Ben Austin, Delgadillo's communications director.</TE>
<TE>   When the Viacom subsidiary STI/Omni Outdoor Systems put up the
billboards on MTA land without local approval, Delgadillo appeared to
relish playing the role of enforcer against the industry.</TE>
<TE>   A day after the city learned of STI/Omni's action, the city's
attorneys were in court, obtaining a temporary restraining order to block
the firm's actions.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm beholden to anyone, it's the neighborhoods," Delgadillo said
in an interview, adding that he will work to address billboard blight in
the city. "I will always err on the side of neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Spiker said company executives felt empowered by their
success in the city attorney's race.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, the billboard companies started going, 'Wow! Maybe
we do have a say in local government,' " Spiker said. "They want to help
out with certain candidates."</TE>

<HD>Suit Protests Davis Review of Clemency</HD>
<DH>Execution: Killer's lawyers say governor is biased against
leniency, won't give petition a fair chance and should step aside. Some
see effort as legal longshot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal public defenders filed a lawsuit Monday asking a judge to
prevent Gov. Gray Davis from considering the clemency petition of a death
row inmate scheduled to die this month, contending that the governor is
biased.</LD>
<LD>   In a move considered a legal longshot, lawyers for killer Stephen
Anderson want Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who also supports the death
penalty, to consider Anderson's clemency petition rather than Davis.</LD>
<LD>   "[The governor] has adopted a policy against any form of leniency for
individuals convicted of murder that precludes [Anderson] from receiving
a fair adjudication of his request for clemency," according to the suit
filed in San Francisco federal court.</LD>
<TE>   "Governor Davis' statements and actions provide ample evidence of his
extraordinary biases against all sorts of request for leniency by
prisoners seeking mercy for serious offenses," according to the brief
filed by public defenders Harry Simon and Margo Rocconi of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The defense lawyers stress that Davis has turned down all three
clemency requests he has received in death penalty cases. And they note
that when Davis was interviewed in 1999 about whether extenuating
circumstances would play any role when he was considering parole for a
person convicted of murder--but not sentenced to death--his answer was
"no, zero. . . . If you take someone else's life, forget it."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, 48, is scheduled to be executed Jan. 29 for murdering an
81-year-old woman in San Bernardino County more than 21 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The San Bernardino County district attorney's office is vigorously
opposing the clemency request.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court has said that some due process protections apply to
clemency proceedings. However, governors or presidents have broad leeway
in how they use the clemency power.</TE>
<TE>   Several legal experts said it would be unprecedented for a court to
strip the governor of his clemency power in a particular case.</TE>
<TE>   "This suit is a real longshot," said Daniel Kobil, a professor at
Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio, an expert on clemency
law.</TE>
<TE>   The case was filed in San Francisco because Anderson is on death row
at San Quentin, which is in the jurisdiction of the federal court for the
northern district of California.</TE>
<TE>   The suit was assigned to U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker, who
scheduled a hearing for Thursday on the defense lawyers' request for a
temporary restraining order.</TE>
<TE>   Ward Campbell, a supervising deputy attorney general in Sacramento,
said the office would file a swift response on behalf of the governor
opposing the suit.</TE>
<TE>   The suit has no merit, Campbell said. "Every court that has ever
dealt" with allegations of the type raised in Anderson's suit "has
rejected them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell said he was not surprised about the suit, given developments
earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 3, Simon sent a letter to Davis asking that the governor
recuse himself from considering Anderson's clemency petition, filed in
late December after the U.S. Supreme Court turned down his last appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "Based upon his public statements and his actions on parole and
clemency requests," Simon wrote, "it appears that Gov. Davis is not a
fair and unbiased decision-maker regarding the clemency applications that
come before him."</TE>
<TE>   Barry Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary, responded in a
letter that the governor would not recuse himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Article V of the California Constitution clearly lodges in the
governor the authority to act upon an application for clemency," Goode
noted. He said that Davis "intends to consider Mr. Anderson's application
thoroughly, and to give it the careful, individualized attention it
merits."</TE>
<TE>   The state Board of Prison Terms is scheduled to hear clemency
arguments Friday before making a recommendation to the governor. Davis is
free to accept or reject the recommendation.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, clemency has been considered an act of grace and has
served as a check on courts when a governor or a president believes that
an execution would constitute an injustice.</TE>
<TE>   For example, during his eight years as governor, Edmund G. "Pat" Brown
commuted the death sentences of 23 killers, while permitting 36 other
murderers to die in the gas chamber. The last California governor to
grant clemency to a convicted murderer was Ronald Reagan, not long before
the Supreme Court ruled the death penalty unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Supreme Court permitted states to reinstate the death
penalty in 1976, both Davis and Pete Wilson turned down all the clemency
requests they received.</TE>
<TE>   The decision on whether to grant clemency is bound by almost no rules.
In California and the 37 other states that have capital punishment, an
individual facing execution has a right to apply for clemency. But a
defendant's rights largely stop there.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the factors that have played a key role in grants of clemency
are doubts about guilt, concerns about sentencing disparities, perceived
unfairness and mitigating circumstances in the inmate's background.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1998 case, the Supreme Court said that normally courts don't get
involved in reviewing clemency decisions. However, the high court said
that some "minimal procedural safeguards" are applicable in clemency
proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Intervention by a court might be warranted, the Supreme Court said, if
"a state official flipped a coin to determine whether to grant clemency,
or in a case where the State arbitrarily denied a prisoner any access to
its clemency process."</TE>
<TE>   However, no court has stripped a governor or any state agency of its
clemency power in any case since that ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's lawyers contend that Davis' record on clemency and his
stance on the issue of leniency for murderers makes him unfairly biased
against any clemency request.</TE>
<TE>   "Actual bias falls within the same realm of unfairness as a coin flip,
since prejudice offends the due process requirement of fundamental
fairness as much as, or more than, arbitrariness," according to the brief
filed by the public defenders.</TE>
<TE>   While saying he was sympathetic to the defense attorneys' arguments,
Kobil said that proving that the governor's conduct had been "as
arbitrary as a coin flip is almost an impossible burden for these lawyers
to carry."</TE>

<HD>For Toddlers, There's Danger in the Driveway</HD>
<DH>Many small children are seriously injured or killed every year when
vehicles, often driven by their own parents, back up over them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jill Mesecher thought she and her husband Rob had done all they
could to protect their precious 18-month-old daughter.</LD>
<LD>   The Stevenson Ranch couple had assiduously child-proofed their home.
They had bought Makena not just one but three car safety seats and made
sure to buckle her in every time before getting on the road.</LD>
<LD>   On a July afternoon last year, Rob Mesecher decided to back their Ford
Explorer out of the driveway to make room to wash his wife's car. He saw
Makena playing near the garage door, and he shifted into reverse. When
the father realized his only child had vanished from sight, he braked
immediately.</LD>
<TE>   It was too late. The toddler apparently ran to the moving vehicle,
according to police, and her father unknowingly backed up over her,
critically injuring her head.</TE>
<TE>   "You can be as careful as you can possibly can be. . . . You don't
expect it to happen to you," Jill Mesecher said recently, her husband
still too distraught to discuss their daughter's death. "Children are
lightning quick."</TE>
<TE>   An increasing number of conscientious parents like the Mesechers are
learning a terrible lesson: One of the most dangerous places for toddlers
lies close to home, right in the family driveway.</TE>
<TE>   A significant number of small children are seriously injured or killed
every year by a car, truck, van or sport utility vehicle backing out of a
residential driveway, studies show. Compounding the grief is that much of
the time, the drivers in these accidents are the children's parents.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all worried about getting into crashes at 60 miles an hour. But
there are all these little kids getting killed in their own driveways
under cars going 2 miles per hour," said Janette E. Fennell, executive
director of Kids 'N Cars, a nonprofit organization that tracks nontraffic
accidents involving children and vehicles. "This is a huge, huge
problem."</TE>
<TE>   According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
children ages 1 to 4 represent about 6% of the U.S. population but
account for 30% of those killed in backing crashes that occur in off-road
areas such as parking lots and residential driveways. An estimated 116
children in that age group die this way every year, according to a study
by the agency based on data from the early 1990s. In comparison, 409
children ages 1 and 4 died in 1999 as passengers in roadway car crashes,
according to the agency's latest figures.</TE>
<TE>   But because driveway deaths have not been tracked on a regular basis
by federal agencies, experts believe the actual casualty rate in parking
lots and driveways is much higher.</TE>
<TE>   An Orange County study in the 1990s found that toddlers were more
likely to be injured or killed in vehicular accidents occurring off-road
than from crashes on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "Young children are at greater risk in private driveways and parking
lots than as occupants of motor vehicles," said Diane Winn, associate
director of the Pediatric Injury Prevention Research Group at UC Irvine
and a coauthor of the study.</TE>
<TE>   There are many reasons toddlers face such perils. Their size makes
them harder to see. Highly active, they can toddle or run quickly and in
unpredictable ways. They are curious, ignorant of dangers and apt to
follow adults everywhere, even when they are in moving cars.</TE>
<TE>   When driveway accidents occur, they tend to be extremely serious,
experts say. Even nonfatal cases can involve fractured skulls, broken
limbs and crushed chests.</TE>
<TE>   Some research suggests that backing-up accidents are more likely to
involve larger vehicles such as trucks and SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   A recent University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine study, which
culled years of data from the Children's Hospital there, found that
pickups and SUVs were involved in nearly two-thirds of driveway-related
injury or death caseload.</TE>
<TE>   Such vehicles cause "higher incidence of striking a child because
there's not that much visibility," said Mary J. Gardner, the former
trauma manager at the hospital and a coauthor of the study. "They're so
much higher and they cause more severe injuries because they're so much
heavier."</TE>
<TE>   A separate Kids 'N Cars analysis, based on data sources such as police
reports, news articles and lawsuits, found that more than half of the
injuries and deaths were caused by trucks, vans or SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   Others already fed up with the super-size vehicles for environmental
and other reasons have seized on the child accident data as "just another
example of how wasteful and destructive these vehicles are," in the words
of Charles Dine, who runs the anti-SUV Web site
www.changingtheclimate.com.</TE>
<TE>   But others believe it would be unfair to blame large vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Vehicles like SUVs may be disproportionately represented in the
accident statistics simply because they are so popular among young
families, said William Brouse, president of Sport Utility Vehicle Owners
Assn. of America.</TE>
<TE>   Some point out that all drivers have visibility limitations of one
kind or another.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many blind spots around a vehicle, even with a small
car," said Sgt. Clint Bowers of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department. "There's probably 10 or 15 feet behind a vehicle you can't
see."</TE>
<TE>   Bowers, who investigated Makena's death for the Sheriff's Department,
said he doesn't believe the size of the Mesechers' vehicle was a factor
in the July 29 accident. "When you have a child or animal or whatever
that's 2 or 3 feet high, it doesn't take much to get lost in the blind
spot," Bowers said.</TE>
<TE>   Jill Mesecher agrees with that assessment. "It could have happened in
any car," she said, adding that all parents should be warned of the
potential dangers in their driveway, regardless of what they drive.</TE>
<TE>   The best way to reduce these accidents, experts say, is through public
education and prevention.</TE>
<TE>   New technology allows drivers to equip their vehicles with video
camera-like devices that enable them to see better behind their rear
bumper, said Fennell of Kids &amp; Cars.</TE>
<TE>   Brouse said his SUV is equipped with a sensor that beeps loudly inside
the cab to warn him when there is something behind him while backing up,
and that he advocates use of such devices for all large vehicles,
including long sedans.</TE>
<TE>   Parents of small children should also treat the front of their homes
as they would any other potential danger zone, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "The driveway is often an area where children play. But the message
should go out that it's not a play area," said Gardner, the Pittsburgh
study coauthor.</TE>
<TE>   Make sure you know where your little ones are at all times, experts
say, and never leave them unattended near any motor vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "We really need the American public to understand that their vehicles
are really 4,000-pound weapons," Fennell said. "Children should not have
to die this way."</TE>

<HD>Police Monitor Complains He's Excluded From Meetings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The man appointed to oversee reform of the Los Angeles Police
Department has complained to the U.S. Justice Department that city
officials have barred him from important meetings, officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   At issue are meetings where representatives of the police department
and the city administration try to resolve differences on how best to
comply with requirements of a federal consent decree, Barbara Garrett, a
legislative analyst for the city, told the City Council's Public Safety
Committee.</LD>
<LD>   By excluding Michael Cherkasky, who was appointed by a judge to
oversee implementation of the decree, people attending the meetings can
speak more frankly and resolve disagreements more swiftly, Garrett said.</LD>
<TE>   "We do not believe we will have candid conversations if we have a
federal monitor from the court sitting [there]. We are not going to be as
productive."</TE>
<TE>   But other council members urged greater cooperation with Cherkasky.</TE>
<TE>   "I appreciate [the city's concerns], but I just refuse to view [the
Justice Department] and the monitor as adversaries of the city in this
process," Councilman Jack Weiss said. "They are partners with the city in
my view."</TE>
<TE>   Cherkasky declined to comment Monday, citing the confidentiality of
his communications with city officials.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department has asked Cherkasky for a list of meetings from
which he and his representatives have been barred, Garrett said. The
federal agency, which is a party to the consent decree, may then take a
position on whether those types of meetings should be opened to
Cherkasky.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials did not return calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who heads the Public Safety Committee,
said there may be justification for city officials to hold private
meetings on how best to comply with the consent decree.</TE>
<TE>   City officials who attend the meetings are made available to Cherkasky
for reports on what resulted.</TE>
<TE>   "The consent decree was not a blanket giving up of the city of Los
Angeles to police itself and run its police department," Miscikowski
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Councilman Dennis Zine said he is "troubled" by the complaint,
saying the city might be wasting time if it meets to work out compliance
issues without Cherkasky only to find that the solution is not
satisfactory to the monitor.</TE>
<TE>   "We are under the court with a federal monitor who is a watchdog of
the police operations, and I don't know why we have to have any secrets,"
said Zine, a former LAPD sergeant. "If we are not cooperating, we seem to
be digging ourselves a deeper hole."</TE>
<TE>   Although talks continue, city officials said the dispute may end up
being resolved by the federal judge who appointed Cherkasky.</TE>
<TE>   Cherkasky and city officials have not reached agreement on some of the
criteria for complying with the consent decree, including guidelines for
when the monitor should review council and police commission actions.</TE>
<TE>   City officials have opposed some of the monitor's proposed guidelines,
saying they erode the council and commission's policymaking powers. At
Garrett's urging, the committee agreed to invite Cherkasky to discuss the
guidelines with the full council.</TE>

<HD>Demirdjian Gets 2 Life Terms for Killing Teens in Drug Deal</HD>
<DH>Courts: The 16-year-old continues to deny bludgeoning Blaine Talmo
Jr. and Christopher McCulloch at a La Crescenta playground in July 2000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calling him a vicious murderer, a judge Monday sentenced
16-year-old Michael Hrayr Demirdjian to a lifetime behind bars for
bludgeoning two teenage boys on a La Crescenta playground.</LD>
<LD>   "Sir, you've committed a crime like a man, and now you'll be treated
and punished as a man," Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Ronald S.
Coen said. Demirdjian received two consecutive life terms without the
possibility of parole for killing Christopher McCulloch, 13, and Blaine
Talmo Jr., 14.</LD>
<LD>   Demirdjian quietly told the judge he didn't kill the boys, whose
bloody and battered bodies were found July 23, 2000, at Valley View
Elementary School.</LD>
<TE>   But relatives and friends of the victims said they didn't believe him.</TE>
<TE>   Blaine Talmo's father criticized Demirdjian for "not showing any
remorse, no emotions [and] the constant lying."</TE>
<TE>   Holding up a large photo of McCulloch, his mother, Aileen Bristow,
said: "Today, tomorrow and the rest of my life will not include my son. .
. . As the shock wears off and reality sets in, the pain only increases."</TE>
<TE>   Others in the courtroom wept as she spoke. Bristow added that she
hoped Demirdjian would ask God for forgiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Demirdjian was found guilty of first-degree murder in November after a
retrial. Although prosecutors announced on the day of his conviction that
more teenage suspects would be arrested, they refused to discuss the
prospect Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "What about them?" said Deputy Dist. Atty. Steve Barshop, when asked
about the youths he and Deputy Dist. Atty. Truc Do repeatedly had named
as suspects in the case and whose photos they displayed to jurors during
both trials.</TE>
<TE>   "If one day the police bring us a case, we'll evaluate it," Barshop
said. "That's how it works."</TE>
<TE>   Glendale police said they are still investigating the slayings.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been working closely with the D.A.'s office on this case from
the very beginning," said Sgt. Ian Grimes, supervisor of the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors argued during both trials that the boys' deaths resulted
from a botched drug deal. Demirdjian and another teenager, Damian Kim,
tried to buy $660 worth of marijuana from a dealer named Adam Walker, who
took their money without producing the drugs, prosecutors said. Testimony
revealed that in the week before the killings, Demirdjian, Kim and others
set traps to lure Walker out of hiding to get their money back.</TE>
<TE>   Talmo, who had introduced Demirdjian to Walker for the drug deal, was
killed during another attempt by Demirdjian, Kim and their associates to
ambush Walker, prosecutors argued. McCulloch was a friend who happened to
be with Talmo that night.</TE>
<TE>   There was ample evidence of Demirdjian's guilt, Barshop said. A police
bloodhound tracked a scent from the crime scene to Demirdjian's house.
Inside, officers found Talmo's wallet in Demirdjian's kitchen trash and
on a wall, dried smears of blood containing McCulloch's DNA.</TE>
<TE>   To prove a conspiracy between Demirdjian and Kim, prosecutors
presented phone records showing numerous calls between the teenagers
before the killings. Barshop and Do also presented evidence that a police
dog detected the scents of Demirdjian and Kim on a rock that had been
used as a weapon, and the scent of Kim's friend, Joseph Song, on the
bench used to crush McCulloch's chest. The same dog did not detect
Walker's scent at the crime scene, according to testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Kim, Song and two others were arrested shortly after the murders, but
were released when prosecutors found insufficient evidence to press
charges. In an earlier interview with The Times, Kim said he and his
friends had nothing to do with the murders.</TE>
<TE>   Demirdjian's attorney, Charles T. Mathews, said his client saw Walker
commit the murders. Prosecutors and police, who had arrested Walker based
on Demirdjian's earlier statements, say they no longer consider Walker a
suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Demirdjian's first trial in Pasadena ended with a deadlocked jury. The
San Fernando jury convicted him of first-degree murder but acquitted him
of robbery, which prosecutors had contended was a motive for the crime
because the victims' pockets had been turned inside out.</TE>
<TE>   The divided verdict showed that the prosecution did not fully prove
its theory, Mathews said.</TE>
<TE>   "The prosecutor says three or more were involved in the killing,"
Mathews said. "I don't think this boy got a fair trial."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Gary and Sossi Demirdjian said they continue to
love and support their only child, whom they adopted as a baby, and
believe in his innocence.</TE>
<TE>   "Our son is a scapegoat, blamed for the death of his two friends,"
Sossi Demirdjian said. "He's not the monster that's been described in the
courtroom."</TE>

<HD>Clinton Says U.S. Must Give More to End Terrorism</HD>
<DH>Lecture: The former president urges Americans to promote security
by easing disparities in wealth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES RELIGION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calling terrorism the "dark side" of globalization, former
President Bill Clinton on Monday urged Americans to promote international
security by easing the world's disparities in wealth, technology and
health care.</LD>
<LD>   The former president, speaking before a sold-out crowd at the
Universal Amphitheatre, said that to reduce the pressures that drive the
dispossessed toward terrorism, Americans must share their remarkable
freedoms and extraordinary wealth.</LD>
<LD>   "If you really want the world you want for your kids, the United
States has to be involved in a world where we share the benefits and
reduce the burdens," he said in the address sponsored by the University
of Judaism.</LD>
<TE>   Clinton said that despite technological advances that could lift
millions out of poverty, half the people on Earth live on less than $2 a
day.</TE>
<TE>   The former president was greeted with whistles, cheers and a standing
ovation when he walked onto the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Lowy, board president of the university, introduced Clinton as
"a great friend to the state of Israel and the Jewish people."</TE>
<TE>   Clinton is one of the most popular presidents among American Jews,
drawing 79% of the national Jewish vote in the 1996 elections, according
to a Los Angeles Times exit poll.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the former president endeared himself to Jews
because of his passionate interest in trying to resolve the Middle East
conflict and his record in appointing Jews to his administration, said
Rabbi Robert Wexler, president of the University of Judaism.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton talk kicked off the return of the university's public
lecture series after a decade's absence. With Clinton as headliner, the
school's four-lecture series on the Middle East peace process became an
instant hot ticket. All 3,000 seats at the original venue, the Santa
Monica Civic Auditorium, sold out in 45 minutes. The university then
shifted the event to the 6,200-seat amphitheatre and all those seats sold
out too.</TE>
<TE>   University officials denied reports in the New York Post that the
school paid Clinton $200,000, "the most expensive lecture fee in U.S.
history." Gady Levy, the university's dean of continuing education, said
the fee was "in the neighborhood" of $100,000. The four-lecture series is
priced at $180 for general seats and $2,500 for tickets that include a
reception, dinner and picture with the speaker.</TE>
<TE>   Other speakers in the series include former Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
political strategist James Carville, who ran election campaigns for both
Clinton and Barak.</TE>
<TE>   For many Jews, the lecture series offers a chance to hear an insider's
view on why the Mideast peace deal that seemed so tantalizingly close
collapsed so abruptly. Since the Oslo peace process disintegrated amid
the violence of the current intifada, a lot of Jews have become
pessimistic about prospects for peace, many community members said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Wexler said, a general sense of gloom among American Jews
has been triggered by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the recent
discovery of arms shipments from Iran to the Mideast and the world racism
conference last fall in Durban, South Africa, at which attempts were made
to equate Zionism with racism.</TE>
<TE>   "Even in pessimism, there is always some degree of optimism because we
couldn't have survived so long without it," Wexler said. "But our
optimism has really, really suffered a blow."</TE>
<TE>   For Clinton, the event offered a chance to help shore up his legacy.
The former president reportedly is frustrated that his image has been
battered since leaving office and has launched an aggressive campaign to
remind the public of his administration's achievements.</TE>

<LD>A Liberian immigrant who smuggled about 200 pounds of elephant
ivory from Nigeria to Los Angeles was sentenced in federal court Monday
to four months in a halfway house and fined $1,500.</LD>
<LD>   The ivory was concealed in four hollowed-out chair frames and a large
box that Ebrimo Marigo, 36, of Hollywood picked up at Los Angeles
International Airport in April.</LD>
<LD>   Thinking it might contain narcotics, customs inspectors X-rayed the
shipment after it arrived at the cargo terminal. They found 22 whole
elephant tusks and about 150 smaller pieces of ivory. Marigo was arrested

<HD>Judge Allows AIDS Rides by Rival Groups</HD>
<DH>Charity: The firm that ran earlier fund-raisers sought to stop a
competing event that was organized after a fight over the proceeds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles judge on Monday waved the green flag allowing two
competing San Francisco-to-Los Angeles bicycle rides to raise money for
AIDS charities in May and June.</LD>
<LD>   The action was greeted with jubilation by the Los Angeles Gay &amp;
Lesbian Center and the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, which may now
proceed with their own ride, AIDS/LifeCycle.</LD>
<LD>   That ride, scheduled for May 13-19, gets the jump on the annual
California AIDS Ride, which was originated by Pallotta Teamworks of Los
Angeles in 1994 and has been run by that company since.</LD>
<TE>   Pallotta also plans to go forward with its ride, set for June 2-8.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Gay &amp; Lesbian Center and the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation had been beneficiaries of Pallotta's eight previous 575-mile
rides, reaping millions of dollars to pay for services for individuals
who have HIV or AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   But in October, the two groups decided to organize their own event
after unexpected cost overruns of several hundred thousand dollars cut
into their profits from the June 2001 ride. The groups also complained
that Pallotta's cross-promotion of other events staged by the company,
such as the Avon 3-Day Breast Cancer Walk, diluted the effect of the 2001
ride.</TE>
<TE>   Pallotta Teamworks responded to the groups' October announcement by
seeking an injunction in Los Angeles Superior Court to halt
AIDS/LifeCycle. The company claimed that the two groups, in exchange for
receiving proceeds from the California AIDS Ride, had previously agreed
never to put on a rival, multiday cycling event without consent.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge David P. Yaffe on Monday denied Pallotta's
request, suggesting that the so-called noncompete clause was not valid
under California law. He indicated that he thought the company did not
have a strong enough case to prevail in a trial.</TE>
<TE>   Pallotta's California AIDS Ride will now benefit AIDS Project Los
Angeles and 19 other groups statewide.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Pallotta's failure to stop the rival ride, a company official
expressed relief that a decision had been made.</TE>
<TE>   "This [has been] driving the riders nuts, making them feel they have
to take sides," said Pallotta President Stephen Bennett. However, he
reiterated the company's position that it's a mistake to stage two such
costly events.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot more money is produced if there's one ride," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pallotta officials have said that extra costs for safety and
logistics, compounded by an unexpectedly low turnout of riders from San
Francisco, cut into the 2001 ride's profits. About half of the $11
million raised went to the Los Angeles and San Francisco beneficiaries.
In years past, the groups said, they often exceeded that share, even
receiving as much as 65% of the proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett said 475 riders had signed up for this year's California AIDS
Ride as of Monday morning. Each rider commits to raising a minimum of
$2,700.</TE>
<TE>   More than 700 riders have signed up to participate in AIDS/LifeCycle,
said Gustavo Suarez, a spokesman for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation.
Each rider must agree to raise $2,500.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer for Pallotta declined to concede defeat on the merits of the
company's case. Attorney Jayne Taylor Kacer of Costa Mesa said several
issues are being resolved in binding arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, Pallotta contends it is entitled to reimbursement for
hundreds of thousands of dollars in costs relating to the 2001 ride.
Conversely, the San Francisco AIDS Foundation and the Los Angeles Gay &amp;
Lesbian Center maintain they are entitled to reimbursement for hefty
costs.</TE>
<TE>   Also at issue is whether Pallotta should receive damages for what it
alleges are defamatory remarks made by the two groups as they have
marketed AIDS/LifeCycle.</TE>
<TE>   A final issue to be determined in arbitration, Kacer said, is whether
the two groups did, indeed, break a contractual agreement not to put on a
competing event.</TE>

<LD>Here's one criticism of television news I've never heard. A Sherman
Oaks resident complained to the media Web site http://ronfineman.com that
a local reporter blinks her eyes "upwards of 30-45 [times] per minute."
He said that's about four times the average. I dunno. It's the constant
eyebrow raisers that really bother me.</LD>
<LD>   Law daze: Barbara Albert sent along a snapshot taken at the rear
entrance to the L.A. County Law Library--possibly for lawyers who require
detailed testimony of what a bell is (see photo). Larry Kallestad saw an
ad placed by a Manhattan Beach lawyer who must do a lot of traveling (see
accompanying). And, in Kansas, George Bethell found a law firm whose sign
might lead some to believe its members do too much traveling (see photo).</LD>
<LD>   The work of a crazed interior decorator? Ida Messinger came upon a
crime blotter item in the Hollywood Independent about a burglar who
removed a woman's furniture "and placed it in her garage."</LD>

<HD>Raid on Lancaster Lab Yields 126 Pounds of Methamphetamine</HD>
<DH>Drugs: A man suspected of running the operation at a remote ranch
is sought by deputies.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the largest methamphetamine labs found in Southern
California has been shut down, but its alleged operator remains at large,
authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Eleazar Garcia, 51, of Littlerock is suspected of running a lab that
produced 126 pounds of methamphetamine with a street value of $5 million
at a Lancaster ranch, said Deputy Dan Burdick, a spokesman for the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   "This was just a huge amount of [finished] product to be sitting
around," Burdick said. "Usually when we find a lab, there's a moderate
quantity, but not more than 100 pounds."</LD>
<TE>   Deputies descended on the remote ranch in the 24200 block of East
Avenue K on Dec. 30 after neighbors complained of a foul smell emanating
from the property, Burdick said. Garcia wasn't there, and no other
suspects are being sought.</TE>
<TE>   Officials also removed a large amount of chemicals, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia is 5-foot-4, weighs 135 pounds and has a mustache. He
previously has been arrested on charges of receiving stolen property and
illegal possession of a firearm and should be considered armed and
dangerous, Burdick said.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of methamphetamine found was almost three times that seized
last summer in the Antelope Valley by a federal and state drug task
force. Authorities said those raids broke up a ring linked to white
supremacist groups and Mexican drug suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed "Silent Thunder," the operation led to 293 arrests, the seizure
of $500,000 in cash and yielded more than 45 pounds of methamphetamine
with an estimated street value of $2 million, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the Antelope Valley is not the most active
methamphetamine production and distribution center in the region, nor has
it yielded the largest seizures in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside and San Bernardino counties are considered by state and
federal authorities as the nation's "methamphetamine capital" in numbers
of operations.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Martinez, a spokesman for the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration, said agents have found higher quantities of finished
product in Riverside County, but he could not be specific.
Methamphetamine production and usage exploded in the last decade as a
more potent, easier-to-produce version made with ephedrine became
popular.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information about Garcia is asked to call the Sheriff's
Department's Lancaster Station at (661) 948-8466.</TE>

<HD>School Chief Backed by Compton Board</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Compton school board is expected tonight to pass a resolution
in support of its new superintendent, who is being investigated for extra
benefits he received at his previous job in New Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   Jesse Gonzales received $390,000 in bonuses and life insurance
policies over his 12 years as superintendent in Las Cruces, N.M. The
state attorney general and prosecutors there are examining whether the
Las Cruces school board's approval of those benefits, which were never
formally recorded, violated the law.</LD>
<LD>   In a resolution expected to receive unanimous approval, the Compton
board defends its hiring last year of Gonzales and cites his record of
building schools in Las Cruces. Board members have dismissed the New
Mexico investigation as motivated by Gonzales' political enemies.</LD>
<TE>   "We are disappointed in the type of politics emanating from his former
employer of 12 years," wrote Compton board President Isadore Hall,
adding: "Here, in Compton, we value and fully support Dr. Gonzales."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite her tearful request for leniency, a Long Beach woman was
sentenced Monday to 25 years to life in prison for murdering her
3-year-old daughter and hiding the dismembered body in a block of
concrete.</LD>
<LD>   "I did not kill my daughter and I didn't hurt her," Rakeisha Lanette
Scott, who in April was convicted of murder, said in Los Angeles Superior
Court. "I ask you not to sentence me for something I didn't do. Please
help me."</LD>
<LD>   But Judge Michael E. Pastor responded that the 1999 death of Milan
Anjonet Scott Wilson was "so horrific as to leave one speechless."</LD>
<TE>   "I have no sympathy for Ms. Scott," Pastor said. "I have tremendous
sympathy for Milan and images that will last a lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   Scott, 24, was ordered to pay $10,000 restitution to the state for
Milan's funeral expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Scott and her boyfriend, Randy Foster, also 24, told authorities that
Milan went to bed dizzy one night after falling down in the bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   When the couple awoke the next morning, the girl was dead, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The couple then dismembered Milan's body, hid the body parts and
placed the concrete in the trunk of Foster's car, according to testimony.
The body remained there for months, decomposing.</TE>
<TE>Body Found in Car Trunk</TE>
<TE>   The child's body was discovered by Los Angeles County sheriff's
deputies on June 27, 2000, after Foster's father, William Foster, told
authorities that he had learned from his son that Milan's body was in the
trunk of a car in the backyard of his Willowbrook home.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Victor Rodriguez argued that the couple
administered severe discipline on the girl, which led to her death.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors found Scott guilty of second-degree murder, assault on a child
under age 8 and child endangerment.</TE>
<TE>   Foster was convicted in April of child abuse but was acquitted of
murder. The jury deadlocked on involuntary manslaughter and assault
charges.</TE>
<TE>   A retrial on an assault charge against Foster began last week, and
jury deliberations continued Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Scott's lawyer, Alternate Public Defender Rich Sternfeld, had no
comment after the sentence.</TE>
<TE>   William Foster said that he hoped other families would "think about
this case and can have enough courage to confront their adult kids in
regards to how they treat their smaller kids."</TE>

<HD>UC Irvine Fraternity Suspended Amid Investigation Into Hazing</HD>
<DH>School: Beta Theta Pi is sanctioned by its national headquarters
after a pledge files suit, saying he suffered a grand mal seizure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A UC Irvine fraternity has been suspended by its national
headquarters during an investigation of a pledge's claim that he suffered
a grand mal seizure and was hospitalized after a weekend of hazing in Big
Bear.</LD>
<LD>   UCI, meanwhile, is conducting its own investigation of Beta Theta Pi
in connection with a lawsuit filed Nov. 28 by Jeff Warden, who said he
was forced to exercise in freezing temperatures and had beer forced down
his throat while being subjected to continuous verbal abuse during the
initiation in December 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Diane Kim, the campus director of student judicial affairs, said a
decision on whether to impose a penalty is expected by the end of the
month. Sanctions could include suspending the fraternity for an extended
period of time or making it the first Greek organization to be banned
from UCI.</LD>
<TE>   Hazing is a misdemeanor under the state Education Code and is
punishable by fines of $50 to $5,000 or not more than a year in the
county jail. Kim also will decide whether to refer the matter to police,
said Randy Lewis, UCI's associate dean of students.</TE>
<TE>   Beta Theta Pi, which has had a chapter at the school for 26 years, has
a reputation for being the top-ranked academically.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we're a bunch of smart guys who are good at sports," said
Edwin Steen, fraternity president. He declined to comment on the
incident, other than to confirm the investigations. The local chapter has
not hired an attorney, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although hazing is specifically prohibited by UCI, "it's hard to
enforce," said Paul Suhr, president of UCI's Interfraternity Council.</TE>
<TE>   Warden, 20, is a sophomore film studies major from Colorado Springs,
Colo., who wants to be a director. His lawsuit, filed in Orange County
Superior Court, seeks unspecified monetary damages for assault, battery,
intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of
emotional distress. The suit also names 13 Beta brothers as defendants.</TE>
<TE>   In describing the stay at Big Bear in an interview and in his lawsuit,
Warden tells a tale of 18- and 19-year-old pledges pushed so hard that
they break down in tears and rebel against the fraternity.</TE>
<TE>   Rush was in its final weekend on Dec. 8, 2000, when Warden and two
other pledges drove with about 15 fraternity members and alumni to Big
Bear. Warden said he thought they were going snowboarding.</TE>
<TE>   When the group arrived in Big Bear about midnight, Steen, then the
vice president, told pledges to hand over their cell phones and valuables
for safekeeping. The pledges were offered beer, and Warden said marijuana
was passed around.</TE>
<TE>   He said he didn't smoke, and insisted on having a soft drink. As the
evening went on and Warden still refused to drink beer, fraternity
members chanted his name, "Jeff! Jeff! Jeff!" so loudly that he couldn't
hear himself talk. Finally, two members picked him up and shoved the keg
hose into his mouth.</TE>
<TE>   What followed was a night of the fraternity members imitating drill
sergeants, yelling abuse at the pledges. Pillowcases were placed over
their heads as they were moved from cabins that were as hot as a sauna to
those that were unheated.</TE>
<TE>   When morning came, pledges were handed a cup filled with what Warden
thinks was raw eggs and hot sauce. Next came a main course of eggs-raw
and scrambled, with green food coloring-that pledges were told to eat
without using their hands. One pledge objected, and a member pushed the
youth's face into the plate.</TE>
<TE>   When they finished eating, pledges were ordered to hold Warden by the
legs and the head and use him as a human squeegee to clean the table.</TE>
<TE>   Then he was handed a mop and told to clean the floor. "I dropped the
mop I told them, 'That's not what we're here for.' I was confused and
furious at the same time.'</TE>
<TE>   Warden said another drinking game began, and he was made to do
push-ups. By this time, he said, he was so tired he could barely finish
one. As he lay on the ground, he was forced to join in a simulated sex
act with the two other pledges.</TE>
<TE>   When he got up, Warden said he told the frat members he didn't feel
well, and went outside for a few minutes. Back inside the cabin, Warden
said he felt his field of vision constricting.</TE>
<TE>   "I was coherent, and then I wasn't," Warden said. "I could feel
something happen to me.'</TE>
<TE>   The next thing he remembered he was in leg and arm restraints at Bear
Valley Community Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   He was diagnosed with a grand mal seizure. Warden said he never
experienced one before, and hasn't had one since.</TE>
<TE>   Fraternity members took him from the hospital and dropped him off at
his aunt's house in San Juan Capistrano.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, Warden's temperature hit 101.5, and he went to UC
Irvine Medical Center in Orange, where he was subjected to tests, which
turned up no abnormalities.</TE>
<TE>   Betas told him not to tell anyone what had happened because the
fraternity would get in trouble, Warden said. They left phone messages
asking him to come to meetings.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he had had enough of the Greek life. He avoided fraternity
members for the rest of the school year.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, he reported the Big Bear events to a campus ombudsman. "He
said I definitely had a case, and I should get counseling and get a
lawyer, and he'd notify the school.'</TE>
<TE>   Warden said that he hadn't plan to sue. The fraternity had assured him
they would pay the $10,000 in medical bills. But he said they paid him
only $3,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of sad," Warden said. "My whole view of fraternities has
changed. I thought they stood for brotherhood, friendship and people
you'd know for life.'</TE>

<HD>Two Teenagers Arrested in Vandalism at Ventura Schools</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Students at two Ventura schools found boarded-up windows, patches
of paint primer and damaged artwork at their campuses Monday morning,
fallout from a weekend vandalism spree.</LD>
<LD>   Two Ventura boys, ages 16 and 17, were arrested Sunday in the
incident, which caused more than $10,000 worth of damage.</LD>
<LD>   At Balboa Middle School and nearby Mound Elementary School, vandals
used rocks to shatter glass doors and windows, and red and black
spray-paint to mark up dozens of walls, doors, desks and student lockers.</LD>
<TE>   Inside one Balboa classroom, the phrase "Meat is Murder" was scrawled
on a blackboard. At Mound, "Hippies Are Alive And Well" was scribbled on
a classroom door.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen it this bad in years," Balboa Principal Tom Temprano
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mound Principal Rich Kirby was similarly surprised.</TE>
<TE>   'We've had graffiti here before, but not to this extent-never this
much," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The damage was still being repaired by school maintenance workers late
Monday. Police said they may seek restitution from the parents of the
teens.</TE>
<TE>   Few details were being released about the suspects, but officers said
they tracked the boys to a neighborhood near the schools after matching
tagging crew symbols at both schools to graffiti left recently on an
apartment complex in the 700 block of Hill Road.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the same words and style on the walls of the schools and on
the apartments," Ventura Police Sgt. Brock Avery said. "They left a
trail, and the officers went knocking on doors and found them.'</TE>
<TE>   Police found items that had been stolen from the schools in the
suspects' possession, Avery said.</TE>
<TE>   The vandals probably went out late Saturday or early Sunday and hit
Balboa first, possibly scaling a large wall to reach the school's inner
quad area, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Once on the campus, in the 200 block of Hill Road, the vandals sprayed
graffiti inside a sixth-grade classroom, doused a television with paint
and dented a kiln in a nearby art room.</TE>
<TE>   Four portable classrooms had windows broken or graffiti damage. A
large glass door at the school's entrance was shattered.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, several clay figurines-student art projects that were
being stored in a classroom-were defaced with paint.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the tagging was indecipherable, just scribble," Temprano
said.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving Balboa, the vandals probably crossed a playground to
reach Mound Elementary in the 400 block of Hill Road, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Although less damage was done there, Kirby said, the vandals used
rocks to shatter a 4-by-5-foot cafeteria window and sprayed gray paint on
a dozen classroom doors and several outdoor lunch tables.</TE>
<TE>   New climbing equipment on the playground was marred with scribblings
from a black permanent marker.</TE>
<TE>   In all, officials counted more than 150 acts of graffiti and vandalism
at the two schools.</TE>
<TE>   No classes were canceled or relocated, but the incidents prompted
concern by students and parents, several of whom called administrators.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes us kind of scared to come to school," said 14-year-old
Alyssa Salinas, a Balboa eighth-grader.</TE>
<TE>   Temprano said that his school has been sprayed with graffiti several
times during the last month, mainly when students were on winter break.</TE>
<TE>   Both boys were booked into juvenile hall. Avery said he expected they
would be released to their parents' custody by late Monday.</TE>

<HD>Ventura County Moving on Cuts</HD>
<DH>Finances: With a potential $20-million deficit, programs for the
poor, and jobs, are at stake and facilities could be closed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Child-care subsidies for working poor families could be reduced, a
jail shut and dozens of jobs cut under cost-trimming options Ventura
County officials are considering to close a projected $20-million
deficit.</LD>
<LD>   County Executive Officer Johnny Johnston has told the heads of 24
departments to begin saving money now because the budget picture is only
going to get worse. The state's deepening recession means Sacramento
lawmakers probably will agree to some of the $12 billion in cost savings
recommended by Gov. Gray Davis in his budget released last week.</LD>
<LD>   Sacramento's budget squeeze will doubtless trickle down to counties,
Johnston said in a report to the Board of Supervisors.</LD>
<TE>   "The severity of pain will depend on the general health of the economy
and budget decisions at the state and federal levels," Johnston said.
But, he added, "by starting now to plan, we can [lessen] disruptions to
public services.'</TE>
<TE>   A good place to start, Johnston said, is trimming $7 million through
June. Agency heads then should identify an additional $15 million in
potential cuts for next year-even if it means eliminating vacant
positions or reducing services, the county chief said.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors is expected to approve those recommendations
at its meeting today.</TE>
<TE>   Johnstonstopped short of calling for across-the-board cuts or a hiring
freeze. But he warned that more severe measures may be necessary if
managers are unable to come up with the cost savings by early February.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Bob Brooks said he already has temporarily cut 11 vacant
patrol positions and five jail jobs. Beyond that, he would be forced to
eliminate programs or close facilities to meet budget targets, Brooks
said.</TE>
<TE>   One possibility is closing the East County Jail on Olsen Road in
Thousand Oaks. Closing that booking facility used by police agencies in
Simi Valley, Moorpark and Thousand Oaks would save about $1 million,
Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement education programs, such as the DARE anti-drug effort
and the Police Activities League, also could be on the chopping block,
Brooks said. But ending those programs would save the department only
about $200,000 because much of the cost is underwritten by grants and
donations, the sheriff said.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd be painful to cut, but they are not the bread-and-butter
service of law enforcement," Brooks said. "We just don't have anything
left that will not impact the public.'</TE>
<TE>   Social services also are expected to suffer.</TE>
<TE>   Human Services Agency Director Barbara Fitzgerald said she will absorb
reductions this year by leaving some positions vacant and contracting out
some services.</TE>
<TE>   But the real challenge would come in the 2002-03 fiscal year,
especially if the state approves funding cuts proposed by Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Of the $2.6 billion in cuts Davis has proposed, about half would come
out of programs crucial to the poor. Programs that provide them with
medical and dental services, child care and housing would take at least a
$1.1-billion hit.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, the biggest effect probably would be on low-income
families who rely on subsidized child care, Fitzgerald said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is proposing to toughen the eligibility requirement and to
increase co-payments. The governor also is proposing to slash a
cost-of-living increase in welfare payments.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, 5,200 households rely on those monthly checks,
which average $479, Fitzgerald said.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Colton Councilman Pleads Guilty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUGLAS HABERMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Colton Councilman James Bruce Grimsby has pleaded guilty to
federal bribery and money laundering charges in a major corruption probe
in San Bernardino County, a federal prosecutor said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   A federal grand jury indicted Grimsby in August on 14 counts of
bribery and seven of money laundering. Seven other men, including county
Supervisor Jerry Eaves, also were indicted. The investigation looked at
four alleged bribery schemes involving Colton council members or a former
mayor.</LD>
<LD>   On Dec. 20, Grimsby secretly pleaded guilty to four counts of bribery
and one of money laundering, Assistant U.S. Atty. Edward Moreton said.
Moreton wouldn't say why prosecutors had not disclosed the plea agreement
earlier.</LD>
<TE>   The indictment alleged that Grimsby took more than $25,000 in bribes
from Allan Steward of Laguna Beach, a commercial real estate broker and
developer. In return, it alleges, Grimsby voted in favor of three
restaurants Steward wanted to develop and a land deal to benefit Steward.</TE>
<TE>   The money laundering charges stemmed from the way some of the money
was "dressed up as payments" to Grimsby's former wife and his wife at the
time, Moreton said.</TE>
<TE>   The maximum Grimsby faces at his March 25 sentencing is 30 years in
federal prison, but the sentence will be much lighter, Moreton said. The
plea agreement is under seal, and Moreton said he cannot discuss its
terms.</TE>
<TE>   Of the eight criminal defendants, only Eaves and businessman William
Shepardson McCook of Newport Beach are fighting the charges. Both have
pleaded innocent.</TE>
<TE>   The others who have reached plea agreements are businessman Michael
Berg of Colton; former Colton Councilman Abe Beltran; Councilman Donald
Sanders, who subsequently resigned his seat; former Colton Mayor Karl
Gaytan; and Steward.</TE>

<HD>F. Shuster, 85; Regular on 'Ed Sullivan Show'</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TORONTO
</DL>
<LD>Comedian Frank Shuster, who with his partner Johnny Wayne appeared
on "The Ed Sullivan Show" 67 times, has died. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Shuster, the sunnier, subtler and taller half of the team nicknamed
"The Kings of Canadian Comedy," died Sunday of pneumonia in a Toronto
hospital.</LD>
<LD>   The Wayne and Shuster team-whose comedy was a blend of gentle satire
and zany fun-first appeared on Sullivan's show in May 1958, spoofing the
assassination scene in Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar." It was called
"Rinse the Blood Off My Toga.'</LD>
<TE>   Born in Toronto, Shuster met Wayne in high school, where they
performed together in revues. They earned bachelor's degrees in English
from the University of Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   In 1941, they made their first appearance on Canadian Broadcasting
Corp. radio.</TE>
<TE>   They entertained Canadian troops during World War II and, later, the
Korean War. They moved to television in the 1950s, where they stayed
until 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Shuster once said the comedy team clicked because the partners had
opposite senses of humor.</TE>
<TE>   "Johnny's is very broad and mine is subtle. He overplays and I
underplay, and we meet halfway," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The duo twice was named best comedy team in North America by U.S.
television critics and editors. (Wayne died of cancer in 1990.)</TE>

<HD>Ted Demme, 37; Director of Movies 'Blow,' 'Beautiful Girls'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ted Demme, the promising 37-year-old director of the movies "Blow"
and "Beautiful Girls," and an award-winning TV director and producer,
died Sunday after playing at a celebrity basketball game in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   Demme, the father of a 2-month-old boy and 5-year-old girl, was
pronounced dead at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center after paramedics
rushed him there Sunday afternoon in full cardiac arrest. The Los Angeles
County Medical Examiner will conduct an autopsy to determine the cause of
death.</LD>
<LD>   Demme, the nephew of director Jonathan Demme, was playing the first
round of the NBA Entertainment League Game at Crossroads School in Santa
Monica when he was stricken. Shortly after playing, he sat on the bench
and collapsed, according to sources. Acquaintances said they did not know
of a history of heart or health problems and that Demme played basketball
with his friends as often as five times a week.</LD>
<TE>   The bearded, outgoing Demme worked in the entertainment industry for
more than a decade, both as a producer-first of music videos and later in
TV-and as a director. Much of his best known work, including episodes of
"Homicide: Life on the Street," and the films "Blow," 'Monument Ave." and
"The Ref" combined gritty, urban street stories with offbeat, edgy humor.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the most generous person," said screenwriter Nick Cassavetes,
who worked with Demme on several projects, including last year's "Blow."
'There was nobody who didn't like Teddy. Every time you were with him you
felt not only like you were the only person in the room but the only
person in the world. There was never any drama. It was like he was your
college buddy. I think he was everybody's best friend.'</TE>
<TE>   Born Edward Demme on Oct. 26, 1964, in New York City, he worked as a
producer, actor and freelance production assistant before becoming a
director.</TE>
<TE>   He began his work in Hollywood as a production assistant at MTV where,
in 1988, he had a hand in creating "Yo, MTV Raps." The show was so
successful that he went on to become a producer and director with the
network. In 1992 he directed Denis Leary in his standup comedy show "No
Cure for Cancer," as well as Leary's 1997 show "Lock N' Load." He also
directed Leary's 1994 comedy, "The Ref," which also starred Kevin Spacey
and Judy Davis.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996 he directed the romantic comedy "Beautiful Girls," starring
Uma Thurman, Matt Dillon and Timothy Hutton. The film, a sometimes
caustic look at the lives and loves of single men in a small town,
established Demme as a promising young talent in Hollywood-though, like
many of his films, it didn't perform well at the box office.</TE>
<TE>   He also was executive producer of the 1999 independent film
"Tumbleweeds," which received several awards and accolades. He directed
Martin Lawrence and Eddie Murphy in the 1999 prison comedy "Life." He won
an Emmy in 1999 for co-producing the HBO drama "A Lesson Before Dying.'</TE>
<TE>   He was a director who loved working with what he referred to as the
"bad boys" of the industry, particularly comic talents like Leary and
Lawrence.</TE>
<TE>   "I love taking these 'bad boys' and 'rebels' and finding a way to put
them together and make it work," he said in a 1998 interview with The
Times. "I really love these guys, love their humor. I get it.'</TE>
<TE>   Leary said in a prepared statement that he had lost "one of his
closest friends in the world. Ted Demme was a great friend, father and
husband-a man whose talent was matched only by his incredible passion for
life.'</TE>
<TE>   Leary introduced Demme to the story of George Jung, whose life was
portrayed in "Blow." Jung, a small-town kid from New England, became
Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar's right-hand man in the United States
during the 1970s. The film starred Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   It was a project Demme brought to then New Line Cinema production
chief Michael De Luca in 1997. It took several years to develop the
screenplay, said De Luca, who first met Demme in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the closest thing to family I have here," said De Luca, now at
DreamWorks. "He seemed to have everything you would ever want in your
life and he made it seem effortless. He was so full of a joy for life
that he was a pleasure to be around.'</TE>
<TE>   Demme, a former football lineman in college, was less than 6 feet tall
and weighed more than 200 pounds. In a September 1998 interview he joked
of his hefty size. "It's encouraging that studios are hiring big husky
guys," he said. "We're a minority that's been deprived of work for years.
The millennium will be good for the husky. Watch out, you skinny bums.'</TE>
<TE>   Demme, who lived in West Hollywood, was part of a group of friends in
the entertainment industry who included De Luca, screenwriter Richard
LaGravenese, Cassavetes, Jersey Films executive Stacey Sher and director
Paul Thomas Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a force of nature, bigger than life and so excited about the
future with so much great work ahead of him," said LaGravenese, who
worked with Demme on "The Ref." 'He was my best friend. I'm angry. And I
love him very much."</TE>
<TE>   Demme was preparing to direct a thriller for Sony, titled "Nautica,"
starring Ewan McGregor and Heath Ledger, but the status of the project is
now uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   Demme is survived by his wife, Amanda Scheer, a film music supervisor;
their two children; his parents; and a sister.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements are pending.</TE>

<HD>G. Fuentes, 104; Hemingway's Skipper</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gregorio Fuentes, who skippered Ernest Hemingway's fabled fishing
boat, the Pilar, for more than 20 years and is said to have been the
writer's inspiration for the embattled fisherman in "The Old Man and the
Sea," has died. He was 104.</LD>
<LD>   Fuentes died of cancer Sunday at his home in Cojimar, the quiet Cuban
fishing village about 10 miles east of Havana where Hemingway used to
dock the Pilar.</LD>
<LD>   Until recently, Fuentes regaled tourists with his tales of fishing and
drinking with Hemingway while seated on the front porch of his small
cottage a few blocks up the hill from the waterfront.</LD>
<TE>   Fuentes was the character of Antonio in Hemingway's "Islands in the
Stream," and he claimed to be the namesake for Hemingway's youngest son,
Gregory.</TE>
<TE>   But most knew Fuentes as the model for the old fisherman who puts up a
heroic fight with a giant marlin in Hemingway's Pulitzer Prize-winning
1952 novella.</TE>
<TE>   Born on Lanzarote, the Canary Islands, in 1897, Fuentes arrived in
Cuba alone at age 6 after his Spanish father died en route. His mother
had remained on Lanzarote.</TE>
<TE>   Fuentes was taken in by a succession of Canary Island immigrants until
he became an adolescent and began earning money cleaning fish and going
out to sea with the fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to Cojimar as an adult and began fishing and piloting cargo
boats. In 1928, he spotted a man whose small fishing boat had broken down
during a tropical storm. The man was Hemingway, and Fuentes towed his
boat to safety, thus beginning a friendship that lasted until Hemingway's
suicide in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   In 1934, using a $3,000 advance from Esquire magazine, Hemingway
bought the Pilar and made Fuentes his captain.</TE>
<TE>   Fuentes enjoyed telling stories of Hemingway's battles with powerful
marlin at a time when fishing gear was primitive.</TE>
<TE>   "You had to be strong for the marlin in those days," Fuentes told a
reporter for Salt Water Sportsman magazine in 1997. "And for the big tuna
too. If you didn't get them into the boat fast, the sharks got them. Oh,
Papa hated that. He would get out his Thompson machine gun and turn the
water red.'</TE>
<TE>   While on the Pilar, Fuentes once told Hemingway about the time, in his
younger days, when he single-handedly battled a 600-pound marlin in a
small skiff. The marlin was so big, Fuentes said, that he had to tie it
to the side of the boat. By the time he reached port the next day, the
marlin had been chewed up by sharks.</TE>
<TE>   If that wasn't inspiration enough for Hemingway, he and his skipper
once came across an old man in a skiff battling a huge marlin.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharks were all around the boat, and we tried to help, but he was
crazy and he shouted for us to get away," Fuentes recalled. "He was far
out to sea and weary, but he wanted nothing. We finally gave him some
food and a few Cokes and continued on. Later, when we heard the old man
had died, Papa was very sad. I know that is why he wrote the book. It was
a tribute to all the fishermen of Cojimar.'</TE>
<TE>   Hemingway described Santiago, the main character in "The Old Man and
the Sea," as "thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck.'</TE>
<TE>   "Everything about him was old except the eyes," he wrote. "And they
were the same color as the sea and cheerful and undefeated.'</TE>
<TE>   Fuentes was in his early 50s when Hemingway wrote "The Old Man and the
Sea," but he eventually grew into the role he reportedly inspired.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters, along with a succession of tourists, frequently made
pilgrimages to Fuentes' bungalow to listen to the old man who wore a
black baseball cap with gold letters that spelled out "Captain Gregorio
Fuentes.'</TE>
<TE>   So many came that Fuentes' grandson, Rafael Valdes, began charging
them $50 for 15 minutes to meet with Hemingway's old skipper, half that
if they haggled. But a bottle of rum would do too.</TE>
<TE>   Hemingway bequeathed the Pilar and his fishing tackle to Fuentes, who
turned the boat over to the Cuban government, which displays it outside
Hemingway's former home near Havana.</TE>
<TE>   After Hemingway died, Fuentes retired as a skipper.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved that man very much, and I didn't want to fish with anyone
else," he said in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Fuentes is survived by four daughters, seven grandchildren and eight
great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Hot Opportunity for Local Flame Bearers</HD>
<DH>Schedule: Forty-three runners will carry the Olympic fire through
Ventura County in a carefully timed display.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARRI KARUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The schedule is timed out to the minute.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday at 9:21 a.m., David Rodela will be standing in front of a
car dealership in Oxnard, where he will meet a convoy of vehicles
delivering the Olympic flame from Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   Wearing an official white Olympic jogging outfit, the Oxnard resident
will light his torch from the official caldron and then carry it past a
crowd of onlookers expected to gather for the event. He decided to walk
with the torch rather than run, because he wants to savor the moment.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm only going to hold it for a little while," said Rodela, 19, a
lightweight boxer who aspires to compete in the 2004 Olympics in Athens.
"So I might as well enjoy it."</TE>
<TE>   Rodela will be the first of 43 torchbearers to carry the flame through
Ventura County as part of its 13,500-mile journey across the United
States for the 19th Winter Olympic Games, which begin Feb. 8 in Salt Lake
City.</TE>
<TE>   At least 11 of the torchbearers in Ventura County are local residents
who were chosen in a nationwide campaign because they were considered
people who inspire others or embody the Olympic spirit. The others were
chosen by Olympic sponsors or city officials.</TE>
<TE>   In all, more than 11,500 torchbearers are scheduled to run, walk or
roll their wheelchairs across 46 states in the 65-day relay, which began
Dec. 4 in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Each torchbearer carries the flame one-fifth of a mile before passing
it to the next. The daily relays last about 12 hours and span roughly 208
miles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's phenomenal," said Jaime Rupert, a spokeswoman for the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee. "It's an experience to see this country, from its
smallest of towns to the biggest of cities. The patriotism."</TE>
<TE>   The relay through Ventura County will begin in front of Todey
Chevrolet, 1345 N. Oxnard Blvd. The flame will arrive in a huge caldron
on the back of a pickup truck, part of a convoy that includes local
police and 12 Olympic vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The flame will arrive from Pasadena, the host city of the relay
earlier that morning. It will be carried roughly 50 miles through Oxnard
and Ventura, passing several schools--including Sierra Linda Elementary
School in Oxnard and Lincoln Elementary School and Cabrillo Middle School
in Ventura--along with numerous businesses and private homes before
heading to Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.</TE>
<TE>   Roads will remain open throughout the course of the relay in Ventura
County, except around Plaza Park in Oxnard, where thousands are expected
to gather for a midmorning ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   At 9:47 a.m., a torchbearer will carry the flame into the park. The
relay will stop for 15 minutes while the Oxnard High School band plays
the Olympic theme song and Oxnard Police Officer Felice Thompson sings
the National Anthem. Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez will present a
representative from the Olympic Torch Relay Committee with a key to the
city.</TE>
<TE>   "The Olympics symbolizes something that is very positive for everyone:
the dedication, the discipline and everything else that is required for
people to get to that point as athletes," Lopez said. "What a good thing
it is for everyone to participate and be aware of [that]."</TE>
<TE>   After the celebration, the flame will continue down the streets of
Oxnard until it reaches Vineyard Avenue near Edelweiss Street at 10:43
a.m. There, the flame will be placed back in the caldron and transported
along the Ventura Freeway to Seaward Avenue in Ventura. The first Ventura
runner is due to pick up the flame nearby at 10:53.</TE>
<TE>   At 10:59, a torchbearer will carry the flame down Main Street, past
Ventura High School and under an arch of helium-filled balloons in the
school's colors, gold and black. All 2,000 students are expected to be
outside, cheering the torch as it passes. Students also will engage in
mock Olympic tournaments in the parking lot, including broom hockey and
slalom races on skateboards.</TE>
<TE>   "The torch only comes through Ventura County who knows how often,"
said David Hess, the school's activities director. "We get an opportunity
to see something you don't always get to see."</TE>
<TE>   The torch last came through Ventura before the 1984 Summer Games,
which were held in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Becky Burnham, a Ventura woman who owns a toy store in town, will be
the last person to run with the torch while it's in the county. At 11:35,
she will carry it down Main Street to Peking Street, where the motor
convoy will take the flame into Santa Barbara County.</TE>
<TE>   Burnham has taken her role as torchbearer seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Since August, when she first learned she had been selected, she has
worked with a personal trainer to get fit. Twice a week she heads to the
gym, where she lifts weights and uses a treadmill while holding a
3.5-pound metal rod in the air--an object the same weight as the torch.
Burnham wants to make sure she'll be able to carry the real thing high
above her head the entire distance.</TE>
<TE>   "If I've got this honor, I want to look good," said the 54-year-old,
who once aspired to compete in the Olympics as a springboard diver. "I
want to hold my head up and look proud. I want everyone who comes out to
watch to be proud of me too."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County residents are also carrying the torch through other
parts of the state on Wednesday. Greg Dollarhyde of Thousand Oaks,
president of the Baja Fresh restaurant chain, will carry the torch in
Mission Viejo, and Simi Valley's Joe LaSalle, a personal fitness trainer
who uses a wheelchair, will transport the flame in San Luis Obispo
County.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels great to be a part of this, to feel more united with the
country and . . . share the Olympic spirit," said LaSalle, who twice
finished the Los Angeles Marathon, but will be pushed during his moment
of Olympic glory.</TE>

<LD>   But one morning she found it torn to shreds in a flowerpot on her
front porch in Oxnard. The iron bracket that held the flagpole had been
pried loose. The pole and the eagle atop it were gone. Red, white and
blue rags were all that remained of the banner she received from the
government upon the 1992 death of her husband, a Navy veteran of World
War II.</LD>
<LD>   The vandal--Burns calls him "a hyena"--escaped.</LD>
<TE>   But on Monday, the Stars and Stripes returned--a gift from Washington
delivered by an honor guard of Cub Scouts and three Marines.</TE>
<TE>Gift Has 'Drained All the Anger' Away</TE>
<TE>   "This has just drained all the anger out of me," said Burns, whose
only son was permanently disabled as a medic in Vietnam. "It's made me
realize there are more wonderful people around than hyenas lurking in the
dark."</TE>
<TE>   With tears in her eyes, Burns watched from her front stoop as Scout
volunteer Don Metz put his boys through their paces.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten-hut!" barked Metz, who introduces himself as "an old Marine."
"Advance the colors!"</TE>
<TE>   While his comrades from Den 7, Pack 3176 stood as ramrod-straight as
Cub Scouts can, 9-year-old Evan Remedios strode forward and gingerly
handed the folded flag to Burns. In an envelope inscribed to her "from
the citizens of a grateful nation," a certificate verified that the flag
had been flown over the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Such flags frequently are given to citizens on ceremonial occasions.</TE>
<TE>   Burns, 75, had been robbed before in her south Oxnard neighborhood,
but she said those crimes didn't hurt her as much as the loss of her
flag.</TE>
<TE>   "At least the burglars had good taste," she joked. "They took all of
my better costume jewelry."</TE>
<TE>   Burns, angered by the flag incident, eventually wrote a letter that
appeared in a local newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   The response was gratifying, she said: People called in sympathy. A
Thousand Oaks restaurant owner offered to give her the flag flying
outside his house. Outraged when he heard of the crime, Metz managed to
reach Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), who had one of the White House
flags sent to her.</TE>
<TE>'I'm Happy, She's Happy'</TE>
<TE>   Metz also tried to round up representatives of the Navy and Air Force
for Monday's ceremony. Burns' husband, Jack, was a sailor who was wounded
in an attack on his ship; her son was an Air Force medic.</TE>
<TE>   But only the Marines--recruiters working in Ventura and Santa Barbara
counties--could make it, standing at attention as the Scouts solemnly did
their duties. Afterward, Scout Aaron Dolan spoke for his buddies.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy, she's happy," he said. "I'm happy she's got her flag." On
the stoop, Burns thanked Metz for securing the flag, for working with the
Scouts and for gathering the troops.</TE>
<TE>   "I understood you were looking for a few good men," he quipped.</TE>

<HD>Judge to Consider Sanchez Request</HD>
<DH>Court: Defense attorneys ask for dismissal of allegations that
could bring death penalty to man accused of killing college student.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attorneys for accused killer Vincent Sanchez, arguing that
prosecutors misled a Ventura County grand jury, urged a judge Monday to
dismiss two allegations that make him eligible for the death penalty.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez, a 31-year-old unemployed carpenter, could be executed if
jurors find that he killed 20-year-old Moorpark College student Megan
Barroso during an attempted rape and kidnapping last year.</LD>
<LD>   Barroso disappeared July 4 and her remains were found a month later in
a shallow grave near Simi Valley. Authorities linked the killing to
Sanchez after he was arrested in connection with a string of rapes and
sexual assaults in eastern Ventura County.</LD>
<TE>   When presenting the murder case to a grand jury in mid-August,
prosecutors argued that Sanchez abducted Barroso after shooting her in
the abdomen with an assault weapon as she drove home from a party.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury also learned that two strips of twine were found
embedded in Barroso's badly decomposed body, one on her neck and one
along her hip.</TE>
<TE>   During a pretrial hearing Monday, Chief Deputy Public Defender Neil
Quinn, who is representing Sanchez, argued that prosecutors led the grand
jury to believe the twine was used to tie up Barroso, while disregarding
an alternate theory favorable to his client.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn pointed to testimony presented Monday that other pieces of
twine, wrapped around bundles of twigs, were found in the ravine where
Barroso's body was recovered.</TE>
<TE>   The twine found on Barroso's body was simply debris dumped with
someone's yard waste, Quinn suggested, and not evidence of a kidnapping
or attempted rape.</TE>
<TE>   "There is this other explanation," Quinn said. "The grand jury did not
have the true facts to work with."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, he concluded, the murder indictment should not stand
because the grand jury was prejudiced against his client by prosecutors
who knew or should have known that evidence favorable to Sanchez existed.</TE>
<TE>   But Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Lela Henke-Dobroth told Superior Court
Judge Ken Riley that at the time of the indictment, the prosecution team
was unaware that bundles of twigs wrapped with a similar type of twine
were found in the ravine.</TE>
<TE>   Henke-Dobroth said there was no way she could be expected to present
evidence favorable to the defendant if she didn't know it existed.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue here is very narrow," she argued. "What did law enforcement
know, and what was conveyed to the district attorney's office?"</TE>
<TE>   Riley took the issue under advisement and is expected to rule in the
coming week. Lawyers are scheduled to return to court this afternoon to
take up another defense motion. Sanchez's trial is set for March 11.</TE>

<HD>CIA Looks to Los Angeles for Would-Be Iranian Spies</HD>
<DH>Informants: The city has the largest population of Persians outside
Iran. Many have contacts in their homeland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Dissatisfied with its intelligence gathering on Iran, the CIA
disbanded a station in Germany in the mid-1990s that had been a key
spying portal into the Islamic republic.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, it reassigned several of its officers to a post much farther
from Tehran but potentially richer in contacts: Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   In Germany, the agency "had eight or 10 people basically waiting for
the phone to ring," said a former CIA officer familiar with the
redeployment. "We had to pursue the Iranian target better and acknowledge
the fact that Los Angeles" has the largest Iranian population of any city
outside Iran.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, Southern California is home to hundreds of thousands of people
of Iranian descent, many of whom continue to travel to Iran, have
business connections there or relatives in position to provide valuable
information from inside the largely impenetrable republic.</TE>
<TE>   Former CIA officers said the agency has been actively trying to
recruit informants in Los Angeles, offering cash for useful information
and even launching some covert operations, including a planned satellite
broadcast into Tehran secretly funded by the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, the CIA has attracted attention for the unusually
high-profile role it is playing in Afghanistan, as well as for its
efforts to unravel terrorist cells around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   But the CIA's previously undisclosed effort to tap into the Iranian
community in Los Angeles shows that part of the agency's war on terrorism
will be conducted at home. Iran is considered the most active state
sponsor of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles program provides a rare glimpse into the CIA's
"domestic collections" activities, which are more extensive than
generally understood and are poised to expand with new funding and powers
from Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA would not discuss the activities of its National Resources
Division on grounds that disclosure of such a program "is not helpful to
U.S. national security." But former intelligence officials familiar with
the program say it is extensive and exists in most major urban areas.</TE>
<TE>   When asked where the CIA has a significant clandestine presence in the
United States, one former staff member of the National Security Council
in the Clinton White House replied simply: "NFL cities."</TE>
<TE>   One of the CIA's largest domestic posts was exposed last year when the
agency's New York station, which had been housed in the World Trade
Center complex, was destroyed by the Sept. 11 attacks. No agency
employees were killed in the attack, a CIA official said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1970s, the CIA's domestic role has been strictly governed by
laws designed to prevent the notorious abuses uncovered when the agency
was caught spying on campus radicals and other citizens in violation of
its charter as a collector of foreign intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA is not allowed to monitor U.S. citizens or permanent residents
in this country, for example. Other U.S. intelligence agencies may
conduct electronic surveillance domestically only with the permission of
a special foreign intelligence court, and only when there is probable
cause that the target is an agent of a foreign power. Most domestic
surveillance functions are the domain of the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   But the CIA still has considerable latitude to collect intelligence
from Americans willing to provide it, recruit foreign nationals within
the United States and support covert operations.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-terrorism legislation recently passed by Congress boosts the
CIA's domestic intelligence-gathering capabilities. The legislation,
dubbed the Patriot Act by Congress, gives the CIA director authority to
set "priorities" for the FBI's domestic surveillance efforts.</TE>
<TE>   A senior CIA official said that provision codifies existing practice
and gives no expanded authority. But the law also eliminates restrictions
that prevented the FBI from sharing the "take" from its wiretaps and
other surveillance with the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   In effect, experts say, the CIA will have a greater ability to have
the FBI do its domestic intelligence bidding, a development that alarms
some critics.</TE>
<TE>   "When it was created in 1947, the CIA was specifically denied any
domestic police or subpoena powers, and Congress was obviously very
adamant in saying it was creating a foreign intelligence agency," said
James X. Dempsey, deputy director of the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a Washington-based civil liberties group. "That line was in
many respects obliterated through the Patriot Act."</TE>
<TE>   But at a time when security has become the priority of a newly nervous
nation, many believe that line could--and perhaps should--be eroded
further. Many in Washington consider the Sept. 11 attacks a major
intelligence failure.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Intelligence
Committee, said he expects to see at least some debate in the coming year
on whether the United States should have a domestic intelligence service,
as many other developed nations already do.</TE>
<TE>   Goss said he doesn't favor such a proposal but expects it to get a
more receptive hearing than would have been thinkable a year ago. After
the attacks of Sept. 11, Goss said, the national mood "changed just like
that."</TE>
<TE>Success Recruiting Foreign Students</TE>
<TE>   The agency's domestic collection efforts have had mixed results. "I
can't remember any great home runs I could ever connect to domestic
collection," said John Gannon, a 24-year employee of the CIA who was
chairman of the National Intelligence Council before his retirement in
June.</TE>
<TE>   But the agency has had considerable success, he said, recruiting
foreign students and other visitors to America, who return to their home
countries and provide valuable information for the United States. "The
CIA has done quite well on recruitment," said Gannon, now vice chairman
of Intellibridge, a Washington-based corporate intelligence firm.</TE>
<TE>   The agency's domestic interests are predictable, several sources said.
On the West Coast, CIA stations are largely focused on collecting
intelligence on China and other Pacific Rim countries. In Detroit, the
focus is the substantial population of Middle Easterners. New York is an
international smorgasbord, with hundreds of diplomats at the United
Nations, a prominent Russian population and local communities
representing more than 170 other countries and cultures.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California is similarly diverse, but former CIA officers said
the agency's Los Angeles station has made a particular effort to tap
Southern California's Iranian population. At least one of the CIA's
officers in Los Angeles is a fluent Farsi speaker, a former agency
officer said.</TE>
<TE>   Iran has been an active front--and source of some embarrassment--for
the CIA for decades. The agency was secretly behind a coup in 1953 that
installed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and was criticized for failing to
anticipate the 1979 Islamic revolution.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. State Department ranks Iran as the most active state sponsor
of terrorism. Tehran backs Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations,
and has been linked to the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia
that killed 19 U.S. servicemen. Last week, Israeli authorities
intercepted what they said was a weapon shipment from Iran to Palestinian
militants. And many experts believe Iran could be the next nation to
develop nuclear weapon capability.</TE>
<TE>   There have been recent signs of thawing in the U.S.-Iran relationship,
and White House officials have said Tehran has been cooperative in the
war in Afghanistan. But last week, reacting to reports that Arabs and Al
Qaeda fighters have fled into Iran, President Bush warned Tehran against
harboring terrorists and war criminals.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence on Iran is extremely difficult to obtain because it is a
closed Islamic society with which the United States has not had
diplomatic relations for more than two decades. Former CIA officials said
Iran is what's known in the agency as a "denied area," meaning the agency
has no presence inside the country.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the United States depends heavily on satellite
surveillance and the interception of radio transmissions and other
signals. For human intelligence, the CIA is largely forced to focus on
Iranian populations outside the country, and none is bigger than that of
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Though Southern California's Persian population is largely composed of
families of expatriates who fled Iran when the shah was overthrown, many
still travel to the country and have family or business ties there.</TE>
<TE>   Former CIA officers said the agency is combing this community for
"access agents," those who may not have direct knowledge of events in
Iran but can get information through connections.</TE>
<TE>   "What you really want is these people to get to family members still
in Iran," said a former officer familiar with the Los Angeles effort. "If
family members trust each other, they'll tell you things you can't know
otherwise, can't get [from satellites]. If you're really lucky, you might
recruit somebody involved in the nuclear weapons program."</TE>
<TE>   CIA officers have to disclose their identities when approaching U.S.
citizens or permanent residents for information. But foreign travelers
and those on temporary visas can be approached undercover.</TE>
<TE>   "You can say, 'I run a consulting firm in Los Angeles that wants to
bring energy companies into Iran when it opens up,' " a former officer
said. Eventually, he added, "you might get to the point where you think
you can break cover," meaning reveal CIA affiliation and simply ask the
contact to spy.</TE>
<TE>   A new informant might be put on the CIA payroll at $5,000 a month, the
officer said. "If the spy were really good, the sky's the limit."</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear to what extent the CIA's operation in Los Angeles has
succeeded. Former CIA officials familiar with the operation said they had
left the agency or were reassigned to other areas before the program was
fully established. The CIA's station chief in Los Angeles did not return
calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Prominent members of the Iranian community in Los Angeles said they
weren't aware of the CIA's presence. "I haven't heard of it," said Syrus
Sharafshahi, publisher and editor of Sobh-Iran, one of two leading
Farsi-language newspapers in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Many prominent Iranians in Los Angeles said they were skeptical that
such an effort by the CIA would be fruitful but were not surprised or
offended that the agency would try.</TE>
<TE>   The risks for informants are considerable. Foreign travelers in Iran,
particularly those from the United States, are followed closely by the
Republic's intelligence service, MOIS, former CIA officials said. Spies
caught by the republic face severe punishment, including execution.</TE>
<TE>Iran Tries to Recruit Spies in U.S. Too</TE>
<TE>   The Iranian intelligence service is also active in the United States,
former CIA officials said, paying close attention to--and trying to
recruit spies within--an expatriate community that includes many people
eager to see the republic toppled.</TE>
<TE>   The republic "regards it as a hostile emigre community," said a former
CIA officer with experience in Iran. "They will attempt to recruit in
that community for defensive purposes or because they want them to spy
for Iran." Expatriates who travel back to Iran are often interrogated
upon arrival, said an Iranian scholar in the United States who asked not
to be identified. "They're astonished at the amount of information that
is already on hand about them."</TE>
<TE>   Travelers are often confronted with details from their homes to give
the impression that Iranian intelligence is omniscient, he said. "It's
the usual interrogators' tricks," he said. "They'll say, 'You have
pictures of the shah on your mantle, don't you?' "</TE>
<TE>   The CIA is not above playing its own mind games with Iran. Several
years ago, a former agency officer said, the CIA funded the creation of a
satellite broadcast designed to bombard Tehran with Persian programming
from Los Angeles, including newscasts and stand-up comedy segments poking
fun at the republic's leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The effort was scrapped within a year, the former officer said, amid
resistance from members of Congress skeptical that such broadcasts were
worth the cost. But the program has since been supplanted by at least
three privately funded satellite broadcasts into Iran by Los Angeles
companies.</TE>
<TE>   The channels air a mix of news, comedy and entertainment that have
found a sizable following in Iran, where satellite dishes are abundant
even though they are outlawed.</TE>
<TE>   Some credited the broadcasts with helping to incite pro-democracy
protests in the country several months ago. The uprising was followed by
a crackdown in which Iranian police combed neighborhoods in Tehran,
confiscating satellite dishes and doling out fines.</TE>

<HD>Gotta Go! The Chase Is On!</HD>
<DH>Despite a drop in the number of police pursuits, TV keeps airing
them and enthusiasts keep watching. Some even get notified by pager when
one is on.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Root's pager sounded and the familiar message on the display
sent a jolt of adrenaline shooting through his system.</LD>
<LD>   He rushed to the phone to alert a friend: "We've got a runner!"</LD>
<LD>   The two men, one in Riverside and the other in Diamond Bar, flicked on
their televisions and soon became transfixed. A stolen MTA bus careened
along three freeways, dodging cars and spewing a shower of sparks from
disintegrating wheels while a line of police black-and-whites trailed
close behind.</LD>
<TE>   "That was spectacular," Root said later.</TE>
<TE>   The 37-year-old film producer had missed hardly a moment, thanks to a
paging service that alerts subscribers whenever a police chase is
televised. Root has been known to pull off the freeway to find a
television, even one in an electronics store, to ensure that he doesn't
miss a moment of unscripted roadway mayhem.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to sound like a nut," he said, "but I am when it comes
to these things."</TE>
<TE>   Root can take comfort that he is not alone. The public fascination
with television pursuits has made them as much a part of the Southern
California scene as surf reports and celebrity divorces.</TE>
<TE>   Southland television stations were the first, more than a decade ago,
to broadcast police chases, and today the region remains the nation's
leader in putting law enforcement pursuits on the air.</TE>
<TE>   Police pursuit mania has spread nationwide. Three networks regularly
broadcast chase shows and spinoff specials. One such program, a rerun,
drew a larger audience than the World Series a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   All this might create the impression of a region, even a nation, beset
by mounting acts of roadway lawlessness, with authorities flailing to
keep up. That would be in sharp contrast to reality.</TE>
<TE>   Police say chases are decreasing in most large law enforcement
agencies throughout the country, although no one keeps nationwide
statistics. In California, chases dropped 32% from 1995 to 2000.
Pursuit-related injuries, deaths and collisions are also down, according
to statewide records compiled by the California Highway Patrol. Even the
Los Angeles Police Department, once the region's leader in police chases,
reported 36% fewer chases from 1995 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Police and law enforcement experts attribute the decline to an overall
drop in crime, better training and liability-conscious guidelines on when
officers can chase a fleeing suspect.</TE>
<TE>   There's not yet evidence that "runners" are learning from the parade
of arrests on their television screens and deciding not to flee. If they
checked court files, they would find an additional disincentive: Running
tends to turn a misdemeanor or minor offense into multiple felonies, and
a short jail term into a multiple-year prison sentence.</TE>
<TE>   But the more authorities rein in freeway chases, the more the
spectacles seem to proliferate in the media and in the minds of a
receptive public. It's a trend that troubles many media critics and law
enforcement officials, but shows no sign of abating.</TE>
<TE>   Among pursuit fans are the hard-core enthusiasts who get an almost
euphoric rush from the chases. The suspense is similar to that of
watching a sporting event, they say, except the consequences can be
deadly, not only for the suspect, but for police and innocent bystanders.</TE>
<TE>   Most police chases end in an uneventful arrest, and less than half of
1% result in a death. But one in five leads to a collision and many more
feature near-misses that keep chase fans coming back for more.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about adrenaline. It's about voyeurism," said Janice Held, a
psychotherapist from Redondo Beach who subscribes to Pursuit Watch, the
police pursuit paging service. "It's about immediately being in the
loop."</TE>
<TE>   Held initially hoped the service would keep her from getting caught in
traffic jams created by the chases. But now she is hooked on the
televised action, which she describes as "adrenaline in a box."</TE>
<TE>   Held said she has even been tempted to walk out on patients to watch a
freeway chase. "Humanistically, we are drawn by drama," she said.</TE>
<TE>Appeals Mostly to Young Men</TE>
<TE>   Held is an anomaly in the world of chase fans, most of whom are young
men, law enforcement enthusiasts and fans of reality-based TV.</TE>
<TE>   Most are like Eric DeBosque, a 39-year-old artist from Ontario. He is
so fascinated by chases that he asks a friend who works at home to
videotape chases when he can't get to a television.</TE>
<TE>   DeBosque tosses off police jargon in describing his favorite
incidents--recalling the "PIT maneuver" authorities in San Diego County
used to stop one suspect. (That's PIT as in Pursuit Immobilization
Technique, a maneuver in which police try to spin a fleeing car out of
control by ramming it from behind.)</TE>
<TE>   "The meat of it is, for me, I just get a big kick out of watching a
person getting arrested," DeBosque said.</TE>
<TE>   Even the military action in Afghanistan did not bump televised chases
off the local news shows. In November--during the height of the U.S.
search for terrorists in Afghanistan--Los Angeles-area TV stations broke
into soap operas, newscasts and network comedies to broadcast 11
pursuits, up from an average of three or four chases per month broadcast
in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had a downpour of pursuits on television," said Ken Kuwahara,
a Los Angeles-area police sergeant who founded Pursuit Watch in January
1999 with only 300 customers. The Internet-based business now has more
than 2,000 subscribers, each paying about $5 a month for the service, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some law enforcement officials say the broadcasts encourage drivers to
flee police if they know television cameras are rolling.</TE>
<TE>   "It glorifies this so that young people think, 'There is my 30 seconds
of fame,' " said CHP Commissioner D.O. "Spike" Helmick.</TE>
<TE>   Other critics decry the broadcasts as shameful sensationalism,
intended to draw high ratings but not to truly enlighten the public.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually, these freeway chases are nothing significant," said Edwin O.
Guthman, a USC professor of journalism and former senior editor at the
Los Angeles Times and the Philadelphia Inquirer. "They don't rate a
paragraph in a newspaper story."</TE>
<TE>   Even Bob Tur, a longtime TV news helicopter pilot who claims to have
invented the televised chase, said he is embarrassed by the growing
number of chases on television.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a lot of money doing it but I regret a lot of it," said Tur,
who broadcast the first live police pursuit, of a murder suspect, in
1991.</TE>
<TE>   Local TV news directors defend the televised chases, saying the
pursuits are news stories with a potential impact on thousands of
viewers, particularly motorists stuck behind or in front of the fleeing
driver.</TE>
<TE>   KTLA News Director Jeff Wald said his station broadcast the lengthy
police chase involving the stolen bus in December because it created a
traffic nightmare for thousands of commuters.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have that many people involved, you have to report it," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But he conceded that competition between television news stations
often influences when a chase is broadcast. "I cannot sit here and argue
the journalistic merits of every police pursuit," Wald said.</TE>
<TE>   Faithful chase fans have helped syndicated television shows, such as
"Cops," "Police Videos" and specials such as "World's Scariest Police
Chases," continue to find prime-time spots on network schedules.</TE>
<TE>   Fox Television's "Police Videos," now in syndication, recently drew
about 8.2 million viewers, giving it a ranking of 80th out of about 150
prime-time shows.</TE>
<TE>   "Police Videos" is so popular that the FX Network shows reruns twice a
day, every weekday. On Sunday nights, the entire family can curl up in
front of the TV to watch three hours of police chase shows on the
Learning Channel.</TE>
<TE>   The man credited with pioneering police reality shows, Paul
Stojanovich--executive producer of "Police Videos" and "World's Scariest
Police Chases"--said such shows still have great appeal. He has produced
more than 50 "Police Video" episodes and six "Chase" specials, including
a special for UPN called "Getaway," which showed officers attempting to
capture top racetrack and stunt drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Stojanovich said he is meeting with Fox executives about buying more
shows. "We are still set to go," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The decline in chases statewide doesn't worry Stojanovich, whose
company, Pursuit Productions of Los Angeles, collects chase footage,
mostly from video cameras mounted in police cars.</TE>
<TE>   "There is such a huge archive of law enforcement footage that it would
take a long time to run out," he said. And production costs in such
"reality" programs are minimal.</TE>
<TE>   For those chase fanatics who can't get enough live pursuits on TV,
video game developers recently released several fast-paced games,
including "Need for Speed 3: Hot Pursuit" and "Driver." These games give
players the vicarious thrill of being behind the wheel of a speeding car
with police in hot pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, a computerized version of the show "World's Scariest
Police Chases" was among the top 20 best-selling video games. It is
promoted with the motto "All the Speed. All the Insanity. All the
Action."</TE>
<TE>Pursuits Are on Decline Statewide</TE>
<TE>   But in the real streets, the insanity and action is on a decline.</TE>
<TE>   Pursuits statewide dropped from 7,817 in 1995 to 5,334 in 2000,
according to CHP records. In that same period, collisions resulting from
pursuits dropped 42%, fatalities declined 45% and injuries fell by 30%,
according to the records.</TE>
<TE>   Police agencies have reevaluated their criteria for launching
high-speed pursuits because of a flood of lawsuits and a mounting death
toll of suspects, police and bystanders.</TE>
<TE>   In California, pursuits were blamed for 143 deaths and 5,626 injuries
from 1995 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Some police agencies, such as the Santa Monica Police Department and
Orange County Sheriff's Department, prohibit officers from starting a
pursuit for minor traffic violations. The International Assn. of Chiefs
of Police recommended five years ago that officers consider weather and
road conditions, motorist and pedestrian traffic, and the seriousness of
the offense before launching a pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the caution grew out of a 1992 chase by the U.S. Border Patrol
that ended when a truck suspected of carrying illegal immigrants struck a
sedan outside a high school in Temecula, killing six people.</TE>
<TE>   In response, California lawmakers adopted a bill the following year
that required every law enforcement officer in the state to receive
high-speed-pursuit training.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you put a focus on a topic, you see a change," CHP
Commissioner Helmick said.</TE>
<TE>   Since an American Civil Liberties Union report in 1996 highlighted the
increasing death toll resulting from LAPD chases, the number of pursuits
by the department has dropped steadily.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the LAPD woke up to the fact that its officers were incurring
a large number of injuries that could be avoided," said Elizabeth
Schroeder, associate director of the ACLU of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officials say the department's pursuit policy did not change in
response to the ACLU report. Patrol officers still have the discretion to
chase any motorist who attempts to flee. But before officers can step on
the gas, the policy requires that the risks to bystanders and the
seriousness of the suspect's offense be considered.</TE>
<TE>   That public safety imperative was repeated often during a recent
training session with a class of police recruits at the LAPD Emergency
Vehicle Operations Center in Granada Hills.</TE>
<TE>   On a Sunday morning, LAPD Sgt. Ronald Moen spent more than four hours
explaining the department's pursuit policy to a group of 21 recruits.</TE>
<TE>   Moen, who manages the training facility, said the courts have granted
police immunity from civil liability for deaths and injuries caused
during a chase. But he said officers can be fired for engaging in a
pursuit that needlessly risks the lives of innocent bystanders.</TE>
<TE>   "Drive in a manner that is reasonable and prudent," Moen repeatedly
told the recruits. "Don't be afraid to terminate a pursuit."</TE>

<HD>Colombia, Rebels Set New Talks</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Accord comes just hours before troops were to retake
zone ceded to guerrillas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOS POZOS, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>The government and rebel leaders reached a last-minute accord
Monday to restart peace talks, pulling Colombia back from the brink of a
full-blown war.</LD>
<LD>   A group of 10 ambassadors persuaded the two sides to end their
standoff only hours before a deadline for troops to retake a
demilitarized zone that the government ceded to the country's largest
rebel army--the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC--three
years ago for peace negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   Colombian President Andres Pastrana maintained a hard line toward the
guerrillas, however, insisting that they take explicit steps toward
peace.</LD>
<TE>   "The process is only justifiable if it produces concrete results,"
Pastrana said in a nationally televised address. "Colombians are not
going to recover their faith in the FARC's word and willingness for peace
with today's declarations."</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana said that talks will begin again immediately in an effort to
reach a precise timetable for discussing such controversial measures as a
cessation of hostilities, a ban on kidnappings and an end to attacks
against the country's infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   But he warned that he might not extend the life of the zone created
for the peace talks after Jan. 20, a previously scheduled deadline.</TE>
<TE>   There is "less than a week to decide whether we prolong the zone. We
haven't arrived at that end," Pastrana said. "It's the moment to advance
with concrete acts of peace."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the diplomats from 10 so-called facilitator countries said they
were relieved to have at least put the negotiations back on track and
stopped the country from plunging into a bloody new chapter of its civil
war.</TE>
<TE>   "The clock has stopped," said Daniel Parfait, the French ambassador
who headed the group of diplomats who undertook a last-minute trip to the
zone to save the peace process. "We have an agreement between both
parties."</TE>
<TE>   Camilo Gomez, Colombia's top negotiator, appeared relieved and said
the two sides will now get back to trying to end the country's
38-year-old internal conflict.</TE>
<TE>   He gave no timetable for renewed negotiations, nor did he say when the
country could expect to see concrete results, such as a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   "We must begin to quickly firm up accords to reduce the conflict,"
Gomez said. "It is going to be a lot of work, not only for the
negotiating table but for the whole country."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the new start, the two sides were no closer to a final peace
agreement. Monday's achievement guaranteed only the continuation of
roller-coaster negotiations that have frequently broken down in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Skepticism remained over whether the two sides would even negotiate in
good faith. Many Colombians believe the FARC uses the zone to build up
its forces, which now number 17,000. The FARC also has used the zone to
hide kidnap victims, provide military training and transport, and protect
cocaine shipments.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the peace process say the Colombian military is also biding
its time, growing stronger as it receives money from a $1.3-billion U.S.
aid package intended to improve its capability to fight narcotics
trafficking.</TE>
<TE>   One diplomat present at the talks called the return to the peace
process a "face-saving" measure and warned of future troubles.</TE>
<TE>   "The government doesn't trust the FARC, and the FARC don't trust the
government," the diplomat said. "'It's unclear what the goals of the
negotiations are."</TE>
<TE>   Another diplomat credited the emergency talks with improving the
chances of international participation in the peace negotiations, a step
that both the FARC and the government have long resisted. But he too
expressed skepticism about the future of the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "We've overcome a big hurdle, but it's only for today. Tomorrow, they
have to show they can negotiate," said a diplomat who participated in the
talks.</TE>
<TE>   But U.N. special envoy James LeMoyne said he was hopeful that the
peace process would now advance. The agreement reached Monday also
provides for the presence at future negotiations of LeMoyne and two of
the 10 ambassadors.</TE>
<TE>   Colombians reacted with relief and joy as news spread that the country
had averted a new wave of violence in a conflict that already costs
thousands of lives each year.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the country had seemed to throw its weight behind the last,
desperate effort to resuscitate the talks, no matter how far apart the
sides. From the soaring high-rises in the capital, Bogota, to corrugated
tin shacks in dusty frontier towns, Colombians were riveted to television
sets to find out whether the nation would return to all-out warfare.</TE>
<TE>   Talk shows were filled with pleas for peace. Senators and union
leaders urged reconciliation. Even Carlos Castano, the head of one of the
nation's violent right-wing paramilitary groups, asked for the rebels to
return to negotiations, promising that his group would give up arms if
the FARC would also.</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of more than 200 men, women and children who had gathered
under a hot sun to watch the negotiations let out loud cheers as Parfait
read the announcement that talks would continue.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd had spent most of the day pressed against a chain-link fence
just 30 feet away from the open-air negotiating table, providing the
diplomats and guerrillas with a palpable reminder of what was at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want peace," said Noemi Sanchez, a 19-year-old from a nearby
town.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the 10 ambassadors, the final push to save the talks included
special envoys from the United Nations and the Roman Catholic Church, who
crowded around white plastic tables under a palm-thatched cabana to coax
rebel leaders back to the table.</TE>
<TE>   The impasse began when Pastrana imposed a series of new security
restrictions after he accused rebels of abusing the zone by using it as a
haven to hold kidnap victims and conduct military training.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels objected that their safety was threatened by the new
measures, which included air force surveillance, restrictions on foreign
visitors and an increased military presence around the zone, a mostly
unpopulated region twice the size of New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Pastrana insisted that the measures were nonnegotiable, and the rebels
walked out of talks in October. Last week, Pastrana gave the rebels 48
hours to leave the zone but then agreed to a U.N. request for final
talks.</TE>
<TE>   LeMoyne struggled alone for three days to make headway. He said that
long-standing mistrust between the FARC and the government made reaching
an agreement difficult.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, after Pastrana had rejected a 14-point proposal from the
FARC and again given the rebels 48 hours to leave the zone, the
guerrillas began making plans for war, according to one source close to
the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   One commander gave orders to 700 men to prepare for battle. At another
time, commanders began pulling out maps and planning how best to combat
the army, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   "They went from being negotiators to being what they are, rebel
commanders. They literally took off for the hills," the source said.</TE>
<TE>   The key sticking point in the talks involved Pastrana's new controls.
After nearly 40 years of fighting in almost total isolation--the FARC has
few contacts with other revolutionary groups--the rebels simply did not
believe that Pastrana would refrain from attacking them.</TE>
<TE>   They worried that the air force planes flying above were actually
targeting them for attack.</TE>
<TE>   "It almost broke and it didn't, and that's why it worked," said one
diplomat close to the talks.</TE>
<TE>   At last, LeMoyne convinced FARC leaders to accept the intervention of
the 10 ambassadors, which convinced the FARC to give in and agree that
its safety was guaranteed. Pledges from the Catholic Church and the
United Nations that the government would respect the zone also helped.</TE>
<TE>   Still, neither LeMoyne nor the diplomats were sure that their presence
had rescued the peace process until only five hours before the 9:30 p.m.
deadline Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "They looked into the abyss, and they stepped back," LeMoyne said.</TE>
<TE>   The FARC agreed to immediately begin work on a peace agenda that
includes a cessation of hostilities and an end to kidnapping. It did not,
however, say when or even if it would implement those measures, something
that Pastrana had seemed to insist on in his earlier remarks.</TE>
<TE>   But Gomez insisted that the new talks will lead to concrete acts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an important step," he said. "'We are satisfied."</TE>
<TE>   The two sides had been closer to renewed hostilities than at any time
in the last three years of talks. On Monday, tanks had arrived just 30
miles south of the zone, and more than 5,000 soldiers were preparing to
invade.</TE>
<TE>   Pvt. Luis Gordillo was sitting with his pit bull and tank crew on the
side of a two-lane blacktop road, where they were awaiting a final order
to be the first soldiers to enter the zone. He was calm, saying he was
prepared for anything.</TE>
<TE>   "If they tell us to go in, we'll go in with optimism. And if they tell
us to go back, we'll go back the same way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Late Monday, there was a grim reminder of the difficulties ahead. FARC
guerrillas reportedly attacked and killed nine police officers in a small
town in a state bordering Ecuador.</TE>

<HD>Indonesian Cleric Laughs at Being Called a Terrorist</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SOLO, Indonesia
</DL>
<LD>With his white beard and bare feet, Abu Bakar Bashir hardly looks
the part of a wanted international terrorist.</LD>
<LD>   With students trailing behind, the 63-year-old Indonesian cleric
ambled Monday across the grounds of the Islamic school he founded here 30
years ago. His large glasses and traditional white cap gave him the air
of an aging owl.</LD>
<LD>   He laughed when he was shown a photo of himself in a Malaysian
newspaper under the headline "On the Run."</LD>
<TE>   Officials in Singapore and Malaysia are not so amused. They allege
that Bashir is the top leader of a terrorist network that plotted to kill
U.S. military personnel and attack other American targets in Singapore.
They also charge that the group is linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
organization.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Singapore has arrested 13 alleged members of the
Southeast Asian group, which is known as Jemaah Islamiah. Malaysia has
arrested 40 alleged members since May, when several were caught during a
bungled bank robbery and the network began to unravel.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore alleged last week that the group had been amassing ammonium
nitrate to make truck bombs and was targeting the U.S. Embassy in
Singapore, among other locations. A videotape and notes about potential
targets were found in the ruins of an Al Qaeda leader's house in
Afghanistan in December, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore released an organizational chart of Jemaah Islamiah that
listed Bashir as the top leader of the group, with cells operating in
Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   The chart identified an Indonesian cleric who goes by the name of
Hambali as a regional leader of the organization. His whereabouts are
unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, has been reluctant
to take action against Islamic extremists, although two men allegedly
linked to the network were arrested last year after one blew off his leg
while attempting to plant a bomb at a shopping mall in Jakarta, the
capital.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesian police spokesman Brig. Gen. Saleh Saaf said Monday that his
department was investigating whether Bashir and Hambali were linked to Al
Qaeda. Saaf declined to discuss whether Singapore and Malaysia had asked
Indonesia to arrest them.</TE>
<TE>   During a nearly two-hour interview, Bashir did not openly espouse
terrorism but laid out a philosophy that tolerates violence if Muslims
believe they are acting in defense of Islam. He denied that he was
associated with Jemaah Islamiah.</TE>
<TE>   "The organization does not exist," he said. "It is only a Koran
reading group."</TE>
<TE>   He said he had been singled out by authorities because his specialty
is teaching young people about jihad, the sometimes violent struggle to
defend Islam.</TE>
<TE>Helps Guide Group Favoring Islamic Law</TE>
<TE>   Bashir is on the steering committee of the Indonesian Moujahedeen
Council, an Islamic group that espouses the establishment of Sharia law
in Indonesia, even though most Muslims in Indonesia are moderate.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the Indonesian Moujahedeen Council favors creation of an
Islamic state linking Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the southern
Philippines. Even so, he said, the organization is not connected to any
group outside Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time Bashir has been in trouble because of his
beliefs. In 1985, he went into hiding and fled to Malaysia to escape
Indonesian President Suharto, a military dictator who didn't hesitate to
crack down on Islamic militants.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir said he did not return to Indonesia until 1999, after Suharto
was forced to step down. Bashir took the name Abdus Samad in Malaysia to
avoid detection. He is still known there by that name.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir said he has not visited Singapore or Malaysia for three years,
although when he was living in Malaysia, he gave lectures on Islam in
both countries.</TE>
<TE>   "Because I taught a jihad lesson, they blame me," he said. "The lesson
about jihad was said to cause restlessness in the community. They blamed
me because I was the teacher."</TE>
<TE>   In Malaysia, Bashir said, he was friends with Hambali, who was also
there in exile. He said he does not know where Hambali is now.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir said an Indonesian intelligence agent visited him last week at
his Al Mukmin school in Solo, a center of Islamic activism in Central
Java province, to discuss the Singapore and Malaysia charges, but did not
indicate that the cleric would be arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir said he expressed his view that the United States was behind
the charges against him and that the agent agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "In this case, I'm very sure that America pressed those countries,"
Bashir said, "because America wants to weaken all Islamic movements,
individuals and organizations."</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, the Indonesian Moujahedeen Council recruited young
Indonesian Muslims to go to Afghanistan to fight against America, but it
ended up not sending any of them because of difficulties getting the men
into the country.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir said he has seen no evidence linking Bin Laden to the Sept. 11
attacks on the United States.</TE>
<TE>   He discounts a video found in a house in Afghanistan in which Bin
Laden gloats about the success of the hijackings. Bashir is certain
Washington fabricated the tape.</TE>
<TE>   "The video was released by the United States," he said. "The
technology there is very sophisticated. People can make things to show
what they want.</TE>
<TE>   "Muslims should defend Islam at any time when Islam is threatened,"
Bashir said. "Today Muslims and Islam are threatened in all parts of the
world."</TE>
<TE>   To help bring the message home to his school's 1,700 students, ranging
in age from 12 to 18, a sign on one of the buildings bears messages in
English and Arabic:</TE>
<TE>   "Jihad is our way," it reads. "Death in the way of Allah is our
highest aspiration."</TE>

<HD>Advertisers Seek a Bigger Role in TV Programming</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some of the nation's largest corporate advertisers, seeking greater
control over television, are proposing to create their own shows to air
on the major broadcast networks.</LD>
<LD>   With the networks suffering a downturn in ad revenues, advertisers
sense an opportunity to buy their way back into the creative process for
prime-time television and, potentially, return to the early days of
broadcasting when they controlled many of the most popular shows. Network
audiences may have dwindled but TV remains the most potent way to reach
customers.</LD>
<LD>   The trend is certain to add clutter to the already heavily
commercialized airwaves, embedding more marketing messages within
television shows through product placement and other subtle, and
not-so-subtle, brand identifications.</LD>
<TE>   A staged, unscripted program created by Ford Motor Co. to showcase its
line of sport-utility vehicles, titled "No Boundaries," is set to
premiere in March on the WB network. Ford also is developing other
series, one of which would feature the Thunderbird.</TE>
<TE>   Coca-Cola Co. is developing an hourlong drama, "Stepping Stones,"
starring Broadway and film actor Gregory Hines for NBC's upcoming summer
season.</TE>
<TE>   Madison Avenue agencies are scrambling to pull together proposals for
other high-profile national clients interested in creating series,
according to more than a dozen ad agency and network executives.</TE>
<TE>   "The networks didn't used to want us," said Rob Donnell, the J. Walter
Thompson ad agency executive who is managing Ford's foray into television
programming. "I sense a sea change. . . . I've been amazed by people's
willingness to write [Ford] into scripts. I've had to remind them to keep
it entertaining. If it's an infomercial, the audience will walk."</TE>
<TE>   The concept is a return to the origins of TV, and that may be a good
thing, some observers said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the way the business began," said Newton Minow, chairman of the
FCC during the Kennedy administration who shook the industry at the time
by calling television "a vast wasteland."</TE>
<TE>   "If the advertisers take pride in where they put their money, it will
be good to bring them back into the process," he said, recalling
respected shows such as Milton Berle's Texaco Star Theater and Kraft
Television Theater.</TE>
<TE>   Minow, now an attorney in Chicago, cautioned, however, that
advertisers were known to abuse their power. The quiz show scandals of
the late 1950s implicated advertisers in the rigging of games.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the early years of television, when programming was relatively
inexpensive, the economic risks associated with TV programming are so
daunting that all but the largest Hollywood studios have left the
business.</TE>
<TE>   The risks are balanced against the potential reward of turning network
television into a more powerful marketing tool, advertising executives
say.</TE>
<TE>   "You are going to see more of this kind of advertiser involvement in
television," Donnell said.</TE>
<TE>   Shows such as "No Boundaries" can prominently feature Ford cars and
trucks, turning the shows into the equivalent of program-length
commercial messages. Advertisers can design shows to appeal to the
demographic audience they most want to reach or to create a particular
brand image, as Hallmark has done with its "Hall of Fame" series.</TE>
<TE>   These advantages will be particularly significant, according to the
agencies, as video recording equipment such as Replay and TiVo make it
easier to skip past traditional ads. Already, with viewers using
commercial breaks to channel surf, ads are less effective.</TE>
<TE>   "Blending a commercial message with a program so that the program is
the message" offers an advertiser "a perfect marketing fit," said Robert
Riesenberg, an executive vice president of Universal McCann, Coke's
advertising agency.</TE>
<TE>   With "Stepping Stones," "Coca-Cola's goal is to have an
all-encompassing relationship with the show," said Riesenberg, noting
that it would feature a multiethnic, multigenerational cast that Coke
wants its brand to represent.</TE>
<TE>   Networks, intent on cutting programming costs, consider deep-pocketed
advertisers a potential new source of funding.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always believed in a separation of church and state," said NBC
president of entertainment Jeff Zucker, noting that advertisers shouldn't
be involved in all aspects of programming. "But we're also realistic
about finances."</TE>
<TE>   Some advertising industry executives dismiss the trend.</TE>
<TE>   "There is almost a frantic attempt by the television programming
community to get advertisers to pay for their untenable economic model,"
said Irwin Gotlieb, CEO of MindShare, a unit of WPP Group, one of the
world's largest advertising conglomerates. "We will be making a terrible
mistake if we put shows on the air just because an advertiser is willing
to finance them. We have to give the viewers what they want to watch, not
what we want them to watch."</TE>
<TE>   Several companies, most notably Procter &amp; Gamble, have always dabbled
in programming. Daytime soap operas "The Guiding Light" and "As the World
Turns" are both produced and owned by P&amp;G, which uses them to market its
products. The company is one of several, such as Hallmark, that have
regularly produced made-for-TV movies to air on the major networks.</TE>
<TE>   During the late 1990s, P&amp;G partially financed "King of Queens,"
"Becker" and "Family Law." They were purely financial investments with no
creative involvement by P&amp;G. The deals have since expired.</TE>
<TE>   Now the investments need to fulfill marketing objectives, said Jeff
Grant, president of worldwide programming for MediaVest, which handles
the P&amp;G account. "The networks are [saying] they will buy a show if they
can get it funded by an advertiser," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone in the industry is enthralled. "It rarely works to
order up a show for [a marketing] reason," said Gary Newman, president of
Twentieth Century Fox Television, noting that his studio isn't currently
working with any advertisers to create shows.</TE>
<TE>   CBS president of advertising sales, Joe Abruzzese, dismissed the trend
as bad business for the networks. "I'm not interested in these shows"
unless the advertiser buys all of the advertising time running with it,
Abruzzese said. "Their hidden agenda is saving money."</TE>
<TE>   NBC's Zucker agreed that the financial value of the shows to the
networks is unclear. "This hasn't been done before," he said. "But it may
be a good way to develop and produce a series that we may not otherwise
be able to afford."</TE>
<TE>   Coke has a development commitment with NBC, but the network is still
debating whether it will order "Stepping Stones" for the summer season,
Zucker said.</TE>
<TE>   Ford also hopes to sell its Thunderbird show to NBC, said J. Walter
Thompson's Donnell.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had talks," NBC West Coast president Scott Sassa said,
stressing that the network has talks with lots of people pitching
programming ideas.</TE>
<TE>   The show featuring the Thunderbird is "a cool guy, cool car show,"
Donnell said, noting that it would be in the vein of 1980s hits such as
"Starsky and Hutch." Donnell also produced Ford's "No Boundaries." Named
after Ford's SUV marketing campaign, the 13-episode series uses Ford SUVs
in a 2,000-mile race from Vancouver, British Columbia, to the Alaskan
Yukon. Ford co-produced the show with Lions Gate Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   "The objective is to help us connect with our customers in a new way,"
said Ford marketing manager Drew Cook. "As we go through this, we'll
learn the effectiveness of the shows."</TE>
<TE>   There is no single economic formula for advertiser-created shows. For
instance, it isn't clear whether Coke would have an equity stake in
"Stepping Stones." But the "No Boundaries" deal could be a blueprint for
other deals.</TE>
<TE>   Originally conceived by Lions Gate, the show was picked up by the WB
after Ford signed on for half of the roughly $500,000 per episode it cost
to produce. In exchange, Ford received a 50% stake in the show.</TE>
<TE>   WB required Ford to guarantee that it would cover half of the 16
30-second spots running with the show. Ford is using four of those spots
and is selling the rest to other advertisers. Ford is paying market rate
for the time.</TE>
<TE>   "With 'No Boundaries,' we get to spend an hour presenting the value of
the Ford brand," Donnell said. And an ad that airs during the show "is
more effective. It spikes the spot," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jed Petrick, president of the WB Network, said "No Boundaries" has
been a successful experiment for the network. "Everyone is looking for
good ideas and sometimes they come from advertisers."</TE>
<TE>   And the advertisers are full of ideas.</TE>

<HD>Enron Chief Was Warned of Problems</HD>
<DH>Energy: A top officer's memo to Chairman Lay, found by
congressional investigators, cautioned that 'funny accounting' practices
could embroil the firm in scandal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<AU>DAVID STREITFELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay was warned last summer by a
company vice president that the energy company's financial practices
might cause it to "implode in a wave of accounting scandals,"
congressional investigators said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The vice president, Sherron Watkins, complained in an August letter to
Lay and other senior Enron executives that a "veil of secrecy"
surrounding the company's "funny accounting" of complex partnerships had
not been adequately disclosed to the public and merited further
investigation, according to excerpts from the memo.</LD>
<LD>   The seven-page memo was found by investigators sifting through 40
boxes of Enron documents obtained from the company after it filed the
largest bankruptcy in U.S. history Dec. 2. The investigators said it
raises troubling questions about the extent to which Enron officers and
the company's auditor, Andersen, were aware of the financial transactions
and accounting practices that contributed to the energy giant's fall.</LD>
<TE>   But Robert S. Bennett, Enron's Washington lawyer, said Lay took the
employee's concerns seriously--and, in fact, met with her and ordered an
investigation. He said the review by an outside law firm found that "no
further investigation was necessary."</TE>
<TE>   "This really isn't fair to the people under investigation," Bennett
said.</TE>
<TE>   Since Enron's collapse, investigators have alleged that the Houston
company used a network of partnerships to mask debt and make its balance
sheet appear stronger. In mid-October, the company acknowledged
accounting problems relating to those partnerships and slashed
shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional committees are investigating whether Enron and its
auditor withheld information from employees and investors that led to
billions of dollars in losses as the company's stock plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they plan to interview Watkins, whom they declined
to name publicly but who was confirmed as the author by her attorney,
Philip Hilder.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins worked for Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow as
vice president of corporate development. She wrote the memo anonymously,
Hilder said, and then sought out Chairman Lay to express her concerns
directly.</TE>
<TE>   "She doesn't perceive herself as a heroine; she was just doing her
job," said Hilder, who said Watkins had written the undated memo in
mid-August. After talking to Lay about it, Hilder said, she asked to be
reassigned so she would no longer report to Fastow.</TE>
<TE>   Before Watkins joined Enron, Hilder said, she worked for Andersen--the
accounting firm that has come under fire for not sounding alarms on
Enron's precarious financial condition.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins, in her late 30s, still works for Enron in a variety of
capacities, her lawyer said. Hilder said she remains on the job because
she "felt loyalty to the company."</TE>
<TE>   "She's been there for eight years," he said. "It's very difficult to
just pick up and leave if you have a disagreement."</TE>
<TE>   The excerpts from her August letter provide a window on an internal
debate underway at Enron about the company's accounting practices before
its problems were widely known.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins wrote that she had complained directly to Jeffrey K. Skilling,
who resigned as Enron's chief executive Aug. 14. Skilling has denied any
knowledge of the firm's financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Skilling flatly denies the allegations in the letter related to
him," said Judy Leon, a spokeswoman for Skilling.</TE>
<TE>   The memo was written about the time that Lay was reassuring investors
and telling employees that Enron would eventually see "a significantly
higher stock price," according to one Aug. 27 e-mail from Lay released
last weekend. Instead, Enron's stock plummeted as investors grew more
concerned about the controversial partnerships. On Dec. 2, the company
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee,
said the memo "clearly shows that top Enron executives, including Kenneth
Lay, were warned of serious financial problems months before the company
reduced shareholder equity."</TE>
<TE>   "What's also troublesome is that some people may have tried to hide
the truth or simply did not want to know it," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   According to excerpts from the memo released Monday, Watkins
questioned the company's accounting methods for numerous partnerships
involving Fastow and for other "special purpose" entities.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow was replaced Oct. 24. On Nov. 8, the company announced that it
had overstated its profit since 1997 by $586 million.</TE>
<TE>   But as early as August, several senior Enron employees were
"consistently and constantly" questioning the company's accounting
methods and use of stock swaps with related entities, Watkins wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "It sure looks to the layman on the street that we are hiding losses
in a related company and will compensate that company with Enron stock in
the future," she warned.</TE>
<TE>   House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin
(R-La.) and Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman of the subcommittee
on oversight and investigations, sent letters to Enron, Andersen and the
Houston law firm Vinson &amp; Elkins seeking records on their review of the
concerns. Tauzin questioned whether Enron officers had instructed Vinson
&amp; Elkins not to second-guess "the accounting advice and treatment
provided by" Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   The review by the outside attorneys concluded that the concerns did
not warrant "further investigation by independent counsel and auditors,"
given that they raised no facts that had not either been known or
disclosed by company executives and auditors, according to congressional
investigators. The firm, however, warned of "a serious risk of adverse
publicity and litigation," investigators said. It was unclear when the
firm completed the review.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Vinson &amp; Elkins said the firm is reviewing the request
for information.</TE>
<TE>   Separately Monday, Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), who chairs the
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, added his panel to the
growing list of those looking into the Enron matter.</TE>
<TE>   Sarbanes has asked five former chairmen of the Securities and Exchange
Commission to testify at a Feb. 12 hearing that will explore accounting
and investor protection issues surrounding the problems with Enron and
other public companies, such as Waste Management and Sunbeam Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The panel will include Arthur Levitt Jr., Richard C. Breeden, David
Ruder, Harold M. Williams and Roderick M. Hills. A spokesman for Sarbanes
said Enron's collapse, which wiped out the retirement savings of
thousands of employees and cost investors billions of dollars, has
brought investor protection to the forefront of the legislative agenda.</TE>
<TE>   The senator also asked the General Accounting Office on Monday to
investigate how Enron's employee funds were handled.</TE>
<TE>   The banking committee's ranking Republican is Sen. Phil Gramm of
Texas, whose wife, Wendy, is on Enron's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   In another development, Andersen, known until last year as Arthur
Andersen, said an Oct. 12 memo sent by the accounting firm's in-house
lawyer "never told the audit team that they should destroy documents for
past audit work that was already completed." Time magazine reported this
week that the memo directed the destruction of Enron documents in
possible violation of the law.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional investigators were focusing on the memo in the hope it
would explain why Andersen had destroyed what they termed a "significant"
number of documents related to Enron.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court on Wednesday will take up the health insurance
industry's challenge to what many experts laud as the most promising
legal reform in health care: independent medical review of HMO disputes.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, California and 41 other states have adopted laws that
give patients a right to a second opinion if their HMO refuses to pay for
a medical treatment.</LD>
<LD>   These measures grew out of complaints from angry consumers and
doctors, who alleged that medical decisions were being made by managed
care firms that were determined to save money, even at the cost of their
patients' health.</LD>
<TE>   Under these laws, an outside medical expert, or a panel of doctors,
can review the patient's case and the HMO's decision. If it's concluded
that the desired medical treatment was needed, the state can force the
HMO to pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   If the high court strikes down state-mandated independent medical
reviews, "it's like taking the metal detectors out of an airport on Sept.
12," said Daniel Zingale, director of the California Department of
Managed Health Care.</TE>
<TE>   California would lose the power to require HMOs to provide such
reviews to patients in employer-sponsored health plans. "It would cut the
heart out of California's patients' bill of rights," Zingale said.</TE>
<TE>   Because the laws are new, experts say it is too early to evaluate
their true effect. But researchers who have studied them are convinced
they are a step in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   "This responds directly to the backlash over managed care," said Karen
Pollitz, a health policy researcher at Georgetown University who led a
study of the independent review laws for the Kaiser Family Foundation.
"If you are a consumer, you get to take your claim before an expert. . .
. And you can get a fast answer to your question: 'If you were my doctor,
would you have ordered this treatment for me?'</TE>
<TE>   "We found that about half the time, the independent review overturns
the HMO's decision," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In California, HMOs have fared slightly better.</TE>
<TE>   Since last January, when independent reviews began in California, HMO
regulators have handled 651 patient appeals. Of those completed, experts
have upheld HMO decisions in 58% of cases and overturned 34%. In the
other cases, health plans reversed themselves during the course of the
appeal.</TE>
<TE>Insurance Industry Fights 2nd Opinions</TE>
<TE>   During the 2000 presidential campaign, George W. Bush said independent
review was the right solution to the managed care dilemma, saying it
avoided costly and drawn-out lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Most in Congress agreed in the early debates over the proposed
patients' bill of rights. While the legislation foundered over whether
patients should be allowed to sue their HMOs for damages in state court,
all sides portrayed independent review as a reasonable reform.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the health insurance industry began challenging state
independent review laws in federal court, and its lawyers have won some
key victories. Shortly after Bush praised the Texas system of independent
review, the U.S. Court of Appeals struck it down as conflicting with
federal law.</TE>
<TE>   The judges pointed to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, which Congress passed to secure the pensions of American workers.
The law set rules for retirement funds and other "employee benefits,"
national standards that would "supersede any and all state laws." This
rule was intended to shield large national corporations, such as AT&amp;T and
IBM, from different state rules.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1990s, most American workers and their families were
receiving health care as an "employee benefit." Typically, insured people
sue for damages in state courts. But when disgruntled patients tried to
sue their HMOs, the Supreme Court said these "employee benefit plans"
were governed "exclusively" by ERISA and, therefore, were off limits to
suits brought under state law.</TE>
<TE>   These decisions shielded HMOs from being sued over their benefit
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   In the Texas case, the appeals court extended that shield to protect
an HMO from the state's independent review law. If a state seeks to force
an employee benefit plan to pay for an extra medical treatment, that
demand "conflicts with ERISA's exclusive [federal] remedy," wrote Judge
Patrick Higginbotham of the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, lawyers for Texas and 24 other states, along with the Bush
administration and the American Medical Assn., urged the Supreme Court to
reconsider that ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the justices voted to hear an Illinois case in which
independent review had been upheld.</TE>
<TE>   It began when Debra Moran, a suburban Chicago woman, complained about
recurrent nerve pain in her right shoulder. She was offered physical
therapy by the HMO used by her husband's employer. When the pain and
numbness worsened, Moran sought out a specialist who recommended a type
of nerve surgery.</TE>
<TE>   While her primary care doctor approved, Rush Prudential HMO said the
surgery was not "medically necessary" and refused to pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   Moran had the operation, paid $95,000 and later sought an independent
review of her claim. A specialist from Johns Hopkins Medical Center in
Baltimore concluded the surgery was medically necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Undaunted, the HMO went to federal court, arguing that the Illinois
independent review law conflicted with ERISA. A divided U.S. Court of
Appeals sided with Moran and upheld the state law. Its judges pointed to
a little-noticed clause in ERISA that preserved standard state laws that
"regulate insurance."</TE>
<TE>   Because the Illinois system of independent review was a means to
regulate health insurers, it did not conflict with the federal pension
law, said the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   But the Supreme Court voted in June to hear the insurance industry's
appeal in Rush Prudential HMO vs. Moran, 00-1021.</TE>
<TE>   In their legal briefs, the competing lawyers argue over whether
independent review laws regulate "employee benefit plans" or insurance
companies. The fate of all state independent review laws might turn on
the answer to that question.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of how the high court rules, Congress could impose such a
system by passing a federal patients' bill of rights law.</TE>
<TE>   HMO industry representatives say they fully support the concept of
independent review. Nearly all health plans offer the option, even for
members in states without such laws.</TE>
<TE>   But the American Assn. of Health Plans objects to different state
laws, which could pose uneven requirements for a company that has
employees in many states.</TE>
<TE>   Only some states require medical reviewers to use nationally accepted
scientific standards, for example. States also have different licensing
requirements for reviewers, timelines for reviews and rules on who pays
the cost of appeals.</TE>
<TE>   "We can be for the concept of external review but also feel very
strongly that there is a value of uniformity across the states," said
Karen Ignagni, the HMO group's president.</TE>
<TE>Treatments OK'd After Independent Reviews</TE>
<TE>   But some Californians say the new system has proved its worth.</TE>
<TE>   Angie Birdwell, 41, used the state's external review process last year
after her physician group and then her HMO denied her 17-year-old son a
referral to a specialist who could treat his heart condition.</TE>
<TE>   "I had been frustrated for so long and felt that I had no options,"
said Birdwell, director of marketing for Wells Fargo bank in the Bay
Area.</TE>
<TE>   The review process overruled the HMO, and on Friday her son will
undergo a procedure to correct his rapid and painful heartbeat. It will
be covered by the HMO.</TE>
<TE>   Sheila Ghen, 36, of Oxnard, credits independent medical review for
saving the life of her 2-year-old son, Caden. She won a referral to take
her son to a pediatric surgeon to repair a life-threatening hernia in his
abdominal wall. Her HMO wanted to send the boy to a general surgeon who
did not treat patients younger than 12.</TE>
<TE>   "My only choice would have been to take my son to a doctor that
doesn't treat children under 12 or pay thousands and thousands of dollars
for this myself," Ghen said. "It's unfortunate that the health plan could
not have figured it out for themselves, and it took the state to
intervene to get it resolved."</TE>
<TE>   Patients requesting information on California's independent medical
review can call (888) HMO-2219.</TE>

<HD>As Passengers Steam, Britain Promises to Revamp Rail System</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Tony Blair may be celebrated in the United States
and well received in Afghanistan, but he is under attack at home by
irritated Britons and an angry press interested in just one question: Can
he make the trains run on time?</LD>
<LD>   So far, the answer is no. The government acknowledged as much Monday
when Transport Minister Stephen Byers laid out a 10-year plan for
revitalizing the country's decrepit railways, which were privatized a
decade ago.</LD>
<LD>   How bad are Britain's trains?</LD>
<TE>   "We have the worst railways in Europe," Peter Hain, the government's
minister for Europe, wrote in the Spectator magazine this week.</TE>
<TE>   Hain got a rap on the knuckles from the prime minister's office for
that comment, and Byers denied that the rail system is Europe's worst.
But in presenting highlights of the Strategic Railway Authority's plan to
Parliament, Byers acknowledged: "We do not have a railway system that is
fit for the 21st century."</TE>
<TE>   Many British commuters would argue that it is scarcely fit for the
20th century. Britain's trains are generally older, dirtier, slower,
later and less reliable than those in most Western European countries,
according to comparisons made by British media.</TE>
<TE>   They are also more expensive. For a 40-minute journey from Guildford
in Surrey to London's Waterloo Station and back, British commuters pay
about $21.60.</TE>
<TE>   A similar journey between Creil, France, and the Gare du Nord in Paris
costs $13.63, and between Paulinenaue, Germany, and Berlin is $12.18,
according to the Independent newspaper. Spanish commuters pay just $4.93
for a similar trip from Aranjuez to Madrid and back.</TE>
<TE>   British commuters often engage in train-horror one-upmanship, trading
stories about doors that don't open, windows that don't shut and trains
that don't arrive. And that's when there are no strikes, as there are
now, and no crashes, as there have been in the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   Don Foster, the Liberal Democratic Party's spokesman on
transportation, called the rail network "a Bermuda Triangle" that
swallows passengers' lives.</TE>
<TE>   Counting every train trip that was delayed by at least five minutes,
he calculated that passengers collectively wasted the equivalent of at
least 4,533 years waiting for late trains in the last 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   John Johnson, a researcher for a mineral company, commutes an hour
from the Oxford area to London's Paddington Station each weekday on
trains that normally arrive five to 10 minutes late.</TE>
<TE>   "At least once a month, it's severely delayed, up to an hour or so.
You can count on that," Johnson said. "I get a seat because I get on
early, but I feel sorry for people who get on in Oxford and Reading,
because they don't get a seat."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, he added: "The seats are extremely uncomfortable because
they are very close together, so you can't read the newspaper. There's
hardly room to breathe."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said he normally pays $6,380 for an annual pass for this
route, although the rail company lowered the price this year by $435 to
compensate commuters for the delays.</TE>
<TE>   Byers, the transport minister, says the problems are due to three
decades of underinvestment and the previous, Tory government's
privatization effort. But in an interview with the Guardian newspaper
published Monday, he said: "There can be no more excuses. It's now our
responsibility. We can't blame the Tories anymore."</TE>
<TE>   That is the attitude of commuters, who note that train service has not
improved since Blair's Labor Party took over in May 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Byers offered the country's 1.2 million train commuters "an agenda for
action. It shows what will be achieved for the large-scale investment we
intend to make over the next 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   The government promises to spend nearly $50 billion over the 10 years
to upgrade the railways and expects the private sector to match the
public money, the vast majority of which has already been allocated.
Included are $580 million for a special rail performance fund to improve
reliability in the short term; 1,700 new rail cars by 2004 on the busy
London and southeast England routes, which account for 70% of all
passenger journeys; and improvements at 1,000 stations.</TE>
<TE>   Tracks and signals are to be improved by 2007, and staff are to be
trained at a national rail academy.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all new projects are to be financed by public-private
partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition Tory Party's transportation spokeswoman, Theresa May,
dismissed the plan as a mix of previously announced programs and
"cosmetic gimmicks."</TE>
<TE>   The Rail Passengers Council, a citizens group that monitors the
railroads, said it feared that even the nearly $98-billion investment
will not be enough, and political leaders questioned whether the private
sector will invest in the railways after the government withdrew
subsidies and put Railtrack, the private company that owned Britain's
tracks, into receivership last year.</TE>

<HD>A Rude Entrance Into Polite Society</HD>
<DH>Culture: A lack of decorum at Japan's coming-of-age ceremonies has
elders trying something new.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>Seeking an antidote to rudeness, drunken rowdiness and a yawning
generation gap, local organizers of Coming-of-Age Day ceremonies across
Japan tried everything Monday from karaoke and charity auctions to rock
concerts and dances with Mickey Mouse to keep young people's attention.</LD>
<LD>   The national holiday is a rite of passage in which 20-year-olds are
welcomed into polite society, traditionally with long-winded speeches by
local luminaries.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, however, a youthful mutiny has underscored the divide
between older Japanese, who were weaned on hard work, self-sacrifice and
respect, and the younger brood raised on materialism, video games and
instant noodles.</LD>
<TE>   Last year's ceremonies were marred by young adults heckling mayors and
governors, rushing stages, throwing beer cans, lobbing firecrackers and
chattering away on their omnipresent cell phones.</TE>
<TE>   "There was so much noise, we couldn't tell when our ceremony started
or ended," said Isamu Miyauchi, an education official in Shizuoka.</TE>
<TE>   While tame by Western standards, the disruptions shocked button-down
Japan, sparking newspaper editorials, study groups and hand-wringing over
the sorry state of today's youth.</TE>
<TE>   A decision by city officials in Urayasu, in consultation with youth
groups, to hold this year's ceremony at Tokyo Disneyland--complete with a
chance to waltz with Mickey and Minnie--struck some traditionalists as
pandering. But local official Hisao Orito said Japan needs to change with
the times.</TE>
<TE>   "Every society has its own rite of passage. Some native groups do
bungee jumps or get circumcised," he said. "We decided to do our ceremony
this year at Disneyland."</TE>
<TE>   Other cities and villages shortened their ceremonies, some to a mere
15 minutes instead of several hours, and held them in hotels and parks
rather than the usual dreary assembly halls and high school gymnasiums.
Tomakomai in chilly Hokkaido opted for an ice skating rink.</TE>
<TE>Out With the Old, in With Nail Art</TE>
<TE>   Tokyo's Machida district decided to dispense with its ceremony
altogether in favor of athletic meets, singing contests, fingernail
painting displays and a planetarium show called "Dramatic Last Love
Letter: The Reason We Love the Starry Sky." Perhaps worried that things
might become too interesting, however, it also included a lecture on
pension reform.</TE>
<TE>   Okayama weighed in with an a cappella concert, a kimono exhibit and a
debate between the mayor and three young adults. The trio accused the
mayor of squandering the city's young talent by not taking their ideas
seriously. "Wait until you are old enough to become elected officials,"
he countered.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Shiki auctioned off the mayor's job for a day, and got
$103 in charity donations. Whether the rent-a-mayor can do any better
than the real one may be secondary. Youngsters remained quiet and
attentive. "We're quite happy with the results," city official Masao Arai
said.</TE>
<TE>   Dangling carrots were supplemented in some cases by barely sheathed
sticks. Young people are legally allowed to drink at 20, and beer is sold
from vending machines in Japan. The towns of Fukushima and Akita banned
alcohol at their ceremonies, however, while Naha posted 20 riot police,
120 regular police and 70 parent volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want a repeat of last year," said Yuto Miyauchi, a Naha
municipal official. "Some new adults drove a souped-up car, disrupted the
ceremony and destroyed the gate of our ceremonial hall."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, there were far fewer incidents than last year across Japan.
Six young men were arrested in Okinawa for heckling police. "They got
furious, so I got furious back," one of those arrested told a local
reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Though Japanese coming-of-age ceremonies appear steeped in tradition,
the idea is said to have originated in 1945 in the town of Warabi outside
Tokyo as a way of cheering up young men returning from the war. It soon
caught on and eventually turned into a national holiday.</TE>
<TE>Growing Divide Between Generations</TE>
<TE>   Behind all the hoopla over this year's ceremonial face-lift is a more
serious issue, said Takahiro Matsuzawa, a child psychology professor at
Shikoku Gakuin University: the growing divide between the generations.</TE>
<TE>   Young people tend to place more value on material possessions than
human relationships compared with their parents' generation, Matsuzawa
said. But parents, teachers, bureaucrats and politicians also share the
blame for providing poor role models, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "While they are adults physically, many young people are not there
mentally," Matsuzawa said. "At the same time, many adults aren't worth
trusting. There are so many scandals, including tax officials found
cheating on their taxes. We can't just criticize children."</TE>
<TE>   Yohei Oishi, a 20-year-old resident of Shizuoka who helped organize an
event for young adults, said the generations don't listen to each other.
"If we want to understand each other better, we need to talk," he said.
"By organizing this, I actually realized there were some cool adults."</TE>
<TE>   Others say that hidebound local organizers who have used the same
format year after year are also at fault.</TE>
<TE>   "If this were a private company, we would have changed a long time
ago," said Tsukasa Matsumoto, an education official in Machida.
"Unfortunately, governments all too often lack imagination or
creativity."</TE>
<TE>Some Question Catering to Youth</TE>
<TE>   Though much has been made of the recent disruptions, many
municipalities report no trouble and stressed that the disruptions
involve a minority of the nation's 1.5 million 20-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   Shizuoka officials said they resisted the national trend to completely
revamp their ceremonies. The city kept its traditional mayor's speech,
"presented in a rigid and solemn manner," although it added a few other
events on a different day.</TE>
<TE>   "I think some of the other towns cater too much to the whims of young
people," said Miyauchi, the Shizuoka education official. "They just
abandon their responsibility to make it easy on themselves. It's
selfish."</TE>
<TE>   Not according to 20-year-old Saori Takakura of Kurashiki.</TE>
<TE>   "I hear that young adults in Urayasu went to Disneyland," she said.
"I'm so jealous."</TE>

<HD>Pakistan Arrests Hundreds of Islamic Militants</HD>
<DH>Asia: Extremists are accused by India of attacks in Kashmir. Move
is seen as part of Musharraf's sweeping crackdown on terror.</DH>

<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Security forces have detained hundreds of members of militant
Islamic groups over the last two days that neighboring India accuses of
launching terrorist attacks in Kashmir, Interior Ministry officials said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistani authorities also closed and sealed offices belonging to the
groups in many areas of the country as part of an effort to halt armed
forays into the Indian-held part of Kashmir. Those attacks, plus an
assault Dec. 13 on the Parliament building in New Delhi, have increased
tensions along the India-Pakistan border and brought the two
nuclear-armed nations to the brink of war in recent weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The crackdown was viewed in Pakistan as the start of a larger effort
by President Pervez Musharraf to rein in Islamic groups that promote
violence as a means of ending Indian control over a portion of the
disputed Kashmir region.</LD>
<TE>   In a major television address to his people, Musharraf announced
Saturday his intention to shut down the groups, citing the need to end a
so-called "Kalashnikov culture" of violence, a reference to a popular
Russian-made assault rifle.</TE>
<TE>   Five organizations were banned. Two of the outlawed groups,
Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba, were accused by Indian authorities
in the attack on Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate response from India to the wave of detentions.
Indian officials have demanded that Musharraf match his tough
anti-extremist rhetoric with concrete actions.</TE>
<TE>   A high-level Pakistani Interior Ministry official, who declined to be
identified, said criminal charges most likely will be brought against
most of those detained. He added, however, that some activists had been
placed in preventive detention in hopes of cooling the tensions between
the nations.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not an operation where they will all be free again in a few
days," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Some reports said that more than 1,000 people had been detained so
far, but officials cautioned against trying to put numbers on an action
that was not yet over.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ongoing," the Interior Ministry official said. "To put a number
on it would be wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Political specialists in Pakistan believe that the crackdown is a
serious attempt to crush Islamic militant groups. It is a step Musharraf
had wanted to take for some time but couldn't, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "These are not token steps; this is serious," said Rasul Bakhsh Rais,
a Central Asia regional specialist at Quaid-i-Azam University in
Islamabad.</TE>
<TE>   Rais said he believed that two factors have enabled Musharraf to
launch the crackdown:</TE>
<TE>   * Newfound support from abroad after his backing of the U.S.-led war
on terrorism has given the president greater leverage to deal with
domestic adversaries.</TE>
<TE>   * Hard-line Islamic groups have suffered an erosion of popularity.</TE>
<TE>   "People in Pakistan are sick and tired of them," Rais said. "They only
cause us trouble."</TE>
<TE>   The White House said Sunday that President Bush had called Musharraf
and Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, urging them to settle
their differences peacefully. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is due
to visit both countries this week during a brief trip to the region.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from wanting to diminish the prospect of two nuclear-armed
nations squaring off, U.S. officials are concerned that the tensions have
led Pakistan to shift thousands of troops from its rugged western
frontier with Afghanistan, where they could help search for Osama bin
Laden.</TE>

<HD>Bomb Kills Palestinian Militia Chief</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Israel won't say whether it assassinated Raed Karmi, but
officials welcome his death.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TULKARM, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Raed Karmi knew he was a marked man. To avoid exposure, he
frequently took a shortcut by the local cemetery, up a short hill and
through an olive grove.</LD>
<LD>   As Karmi walked the path Monday morning from his safe house, a bomb
planted alongside the cemetery wall exploded. Karmi, a top Palestinian
militia commander who proudly confessed to murdering Israelis, was killed
instantly.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli officials would neither confirm nor deny that they ordered his
death, but they quickly welcomed it. If Karmi--who stood near the top of
Israel's most-wanted list--was killed by the Israelis, it would be the
first time the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has successfully
used its internationally condemned assassination policy in nearly two
months.</LD>
<TE>   In keeping with recent history, revenge and counterattack appear
likely to follow: Hours after Karmi was killed, an Israeli soldier was
shot dead while driving near a Jewish settlement on the road to Tulkarm.</TE>
<TE>   Karmi's militia, an offshoot of Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat's Fatah movement, claimed responsibility for shooting the soldier
and wounding his companion. The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade also announced
that it would no longer heed a truce with Israel observed since
mid-December.</TE>
<TE>   With the killing of Karmi, Israel has "opened the gates to hell," the
Tulkarm branch of the group warned in a leaflet. "The hoax of the
so-called cease-fire is canceled, canceled, canceled."</TE>
<TE>   Young Palestinian men read the scathing statement over loudspeakers
Monday afternoon from the back of a pickup truck that was coursing
Tulkarm's streets, made nearly empty by a general protest over Karmi's
killing.</TE>
<TE>   The news of his death came as Israel sent bulldozers into a
Palestinian neighborhood in East Jerusalem to demolish nine homes.
Israeli officials said the homes were built without permits; the U.S.
government condemned the action as provocative. It came amid continuing
domestic and international outcry over Israel's demolition last week of
dozens of Palestinian homes in the Gaza Strip, a move Sharon's government
said was part of its fight against arms smuggling.</TE>
<TE>   In Tulkarm, an angry, mournful crowd carried Karmi's body to the city
hospital amid cries for revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Tulkarm in many ways encapsulates the eye-for-an-eye nature of more
than 15 months of Middle East bloodletting. Karmi was sought by the
Israelis for his role in several killings, starting with the Jan. 23
shooting of two Tel Aviv restaurateurs in Tulkarm. The pair had gone to
the town with an Arab friend to shop and eat lunch, something Israelis
used to do frequently before the current conflict erupted.</TE>
<TE>   Karmi and his fellow gunmen killed the restaurant owners to avenge the
death three weeks earlier of Thabet Thabet, a dentist and head of the
Fatah movement in Tulkarm. Israeli forces shot him as he left his home,
in one of the most controversial of the dozens of assassinations that
Israel has carried out in the name of self-defense. Several Israeli peace
activists and politicians defended Thabet and argued that the military
had killed the wrong man; the army said he had directed shooting attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Thabet's slaying gave momentum to Karmi's militia, which he formed
along with Thabet's nephew, Maslamah Thabet.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Thabet, milling outside the hospital Monday with numerous
armed men, said Karmi left his hide-out after receiving a telephone call
and was killed half a block down the road by what Thabet believed was a
remote-controlled bomb. The blast left a small pit in the road and a
puddle of blood, which Palestinian children were examining Monday
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question Israel is behind this," Thabet said, nervously
chain-smoking and fiddling with his cellular phone.</TE>
<TE>   Karmi, 27, survived an earlier attempt on his life. On Sept. 6,
Israeli helicopter gunships fired missiles into his car as he and three
companions drove on the outskirts of Tulkarm. He and the driver escaped;
the two others were killed.</TE>
<TE>   His close call made him something of a celebrity here. He boasted that
God was on his side and that Israel couldn't touch him. He appeared at
funerals and on television.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, Palestinians say, Karmi and his men had been abiding by a
suspension of hostilities ordered by Arafat on Dec. 16. A period of
relative calm followed, but it was shattered last week by an Islamic
militant attack on an Israeli army post near the Gaza Strip. Four
Israelis and two Palestinians were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials hold Karmi responsible for the slayings of nine
Israelis, including the two restaurateurs. They said Monday that the fact
Karmi was on the loose exposes the hypocrisy of Arafat's pledge to rein
in violence by arresting militants wanted by Israel. Sharon spokesman
Raanan Gissin said the Palestinian Authority recently had notified Israel
that Karmi was in custody.</TE>
<TE>   "A man like this is like a ticking bomb," Israeli Transportation
Minister Ephraim Sneh told reporters when asked if the timing of Monday's
blast--amid a relative lull in violence and during renewed U.S. efforts
to broker peace--was ill-advised. "He who lives by the sword dies by the
sword."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials, in turn, accused Israel of attempting to
provoke Palestinian violence to sabotage the mission of U.S. envoy
Anthony C. Zinni. The retired Marine Corps general is expected to return
to the region soon.</TE>
<TE>   On the eve of Zinni's first official trip to the region in November,
Israel assassinated Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, a top military commander of the
radical Islamic movement Hamas. The group exacted revenge with a burst of
suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   Karmi's friends and family promised Monday that more revenge will
follow.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an excuse now for us to kill any Israeli," Karmi's
18-year-old half brother, Raef, said. "As we have here a new widow, a new
orphan, a lost brother, there will be someone in Israel who will suffer
the same."</TE>
<TE>   Relatives said the timing of Monday's explosion caught them off guard.</TE>
<TE>   "They killed him when things here had been quiet. I was surprised when
I heard that there was another martyr; there's a cease-fire, after all,"
said Hadija Saai, a cousin.</TE>
<TE>   "He was always taking precautions, but he was not afraid," said
Karmi's widow, Linda, 24, at the family home. She was surrounded by
female relatives who passed among them the Karmis' 6-month-old daughter,
Filistine.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after the blast killed Karmi, Palestinian gunmen opened fire
near the West Bank Jewish settlement of Shavei Shomron, killing the
Israeli soldier. Sporadic shooting was reported throughout the area.</TE>
<TE>   In Jerusalem, meanwhile, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said he, Sharon
and Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer had decided to stop demolitions
of Palestinian homes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip following a
firestorm over last week's destruction of houses in the Rafah refugee
camp in Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned a lesson and reached the conclusion that [with] this
method, the damage it causes is greater than the benefit," Peres said.</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon and Ben-Eliezer later contradicted Peres, saying there had
been no change in policy. Both indicated that home demolitions will
continue based on "security considerations."</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A senior executive of cellular phone maker Nokia is appealing a
record $103,600 fine for speeding because his income has dropped, Finnish
media and officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Millionaire Anssi Vanjoki was caught in October driving his motorcycle
in Helsinki, the capital, at 47 mph in a 30-mph zone, the Ilta-Sanomat
newspaper reported.</LD>
<LD>   Finnish traffic fines vary according to the offender's average income.
The fine was based on Vanjoki's 1999 income, which was boosted by
stock-options sales. But he said his income dropped sharply last year as
Nokia's share price fell.</LD>
<TE>   Vanjoki's fine is believed to be Finland's largest traffic penalty.
His appeal is to be heard May 15.</TE>

<HD>British Museum Won't Give Up Elgin Marbles</HD>
<DH>Art: Facility chief says there's no plan to lend the Parthenon
statues. He urges Greece to improve care of its other treasures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>The Elgin Marbles will remain in the British Museum in London
despite attempts by Greece to have the famous Parthenon sculptures
returned, the museum's director said today.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Anderson said the British Museum's trustees have no legal right
to dispose of any exhibits even if they want to.</LD>
<LD>   The return of the 2,500-year-old marbles removed from the Parthenon by
Lord Elgin two centuries ago has long been demanded by Greece, and the
issue often sours relations between Athens and London.</LD>
<TE>   Writing in The Times newspaper, Anderson said there had been
speculation that the British Museum might agree to lend the sculptures
for exhibition in 2004, when Athens is to host the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "It is normal courtesy that such requests are addressed first to the
Museum Director, but so far no such request has been received," Anderson
said.</TE>
<TE>   There were press reports that Greece was building a museum in Athens
designed to hold the Elgin Marbles, Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   But Greece might make a more appropriate symbolic gesture for 2004 if
it were to ensure it could properly display the many sculptures from the
Parthenon that it currently had "lumbered in store-rooms," he added.</TE>
<TE>   "Meanwhile the British Museum's sculptures are where they will remain,
in the museum's own purpose-built gallery, where they are displayed free
for all," Anderson added.</TE>
<TE>   He said Greece had given up previous attempts to challenge the British
Museum's legal ownership of the marbles, which Anderson described as
"unassailable."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Athens was seeking possession of them by trying to pressure
the British Museum into agreeing to a loan, something the museum had no
power to grant.</TE>
<TE>   Greece says Elgin illegally removed the stones, known locally as the
Parthenon marbles, after bribing Ottoman officials.</TE>
<TE>   But the British Museum refuses to give the 56 blocks of frieze and 19
statues back, saying Elgin had legitimate papers.</TE>

<HD>Polish Regime Blames Economy's Woes on Top Bank</HD>
<DH>Europe: Institution's independence is threatened in dispute,
jeopardizing nation's efforts to join EU.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WARSAW
</DL>
<LD>Buffeted by soaring unemployment and plunging popular support,
Poland's new government of former Communists is lashing out at the
central bank, blaming it for stalling the economy.</LD>
<LD>   "Without a substantial lowering of interest rates, there is no chance
for Poland to get out from economic crisis," Deputy Prime Minister Marek
Pol declared last week. Pol charged that central bank policies "cost
hundreds of thousands of people their jobs" and that "those people can
now thank those who made the wrong decisions."</LD>
<LD>   The highly politicized dispute presents a new obstacle in Poland's
efforts to join the European Union. Politicians critical of the bank's
moves to fight inflation through high interest rates are threatening to
restrict its latitude by stacking its policy-setting board with new
members, even though central bank independence is a key condition for EU
membership.</LD>
<TE>   Poland is by far the biggest among former Soviet bloc countries that
hope to join the EU in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Former central bank President Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz weighed in last
Tuesday, telling reporters that during her years at the helm, "never was
there an attack on the bank's independence comparable to the present
one."</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Leszek Miller's social democratic government, which
took office in October, argues that in order to boost economic growth and
create jobs, there should be a cut this month of 4 to 5 percentage points
from the bank's current 11.5% benchmark interest rate.</TE>
<TE>   Bank policymakers, who cut rates by 7.5 percentage points last year,
fear that too-rapid additional cuts could trigger sharp inflation, a
collapse in the value of the Polish currency and a deeper economic
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The clash also has a personal element. Leszek Balcerowicz, president
of the National Bank of Poland, the central bank, and head of its
10-member Monetary Policy Council, is a former finance minister widely
viewed as the architect of the nation's post-Communist economic reforms.
He has won praise from foreign analysts and governments but is hated by
many Poles who have lost jobs or suffered reduced purchasing power in the
transition to a market economy.</TE>
<TE>   A composite photo published Thursday in Super Express, a
mass-circulation tabloid, shows two martial artists bearing the
patched-on faces of Miller and Balcerowicz, with the grim prime minister
delivering a kick toward his bespectacled opponent's resolute face. The
headline reads: "The Rate Duel." The humor is compounded by an implied
Polish pun; the word stopa means both rate and foot.</TE>
<TE>   Miller and five top ministers held a highly publicized but
inconclusive meeting with Balcerowicz and other bank officials Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not come here to negotiate the level of interest rates
because that is not within the framework of the constitution,"
Balcerowicz said before the meeting. "We have come here in the highest
interest of the country to stop the dangerous process of confrontation,
which was not started by us."</TE>
<TE>   After the talks, central bank officials skipped what had been planned
as a joint news conference, but Finance Minister Marek Belka called it "a
good and useful meeting."</TE>
<TE>   Many respected economists argue that the central bank might have been
wiser to cut rates more rapidly last year. They blame its policies for
contributing to a fall in economic growth to 1% last year compared with
4% in 2000, and a jump in unemployment to nearly 17%, the highest level
since the 1989 collapse of communism. About 3 million people were out of
work in November.</TE>
<TE>   But the government's heavy-handed attempts to pressure the central
bank have drawn criticism and even ridicule, as well as warnings that an
all-out confrontation could only damage Poland's interests.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict has become so bitter that cooperation will not come
easily, Rzeczpospolita, a leading newspaper, said in an editorial. "Ten
financial wise men [the bank's policy council] think that they have
become whipping boys, and that the government's conflict with the council
is a smoke screen to hide its lack of an economic program," it wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Miller has stressed repeatedly that he inherited a dismal economic
situation from the center-right coalition that was ousted in September
elections. But critics charge that his government is trying to escape
blame for failing to fulfill promises to boost growth and cut
unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   "The strategy of the new government was first to blame the former
government," said Andrzej Rychard, a sociologist at Central European
University in Warsaw. After three months in office, "it might be the case
they are looking for new suspects to be blamed for the current state of
the economy."</TE>
<TE>   A survey by the respected OBOP polling agency published last week
showed that 51% of respondents felt that the government was not keeping
its election promises, while just 19% said it was keeping them. As for
the government's effectiveness, 38% said it was worse than they had
hoped, and 11% said it surpassed their expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Miroslawa Marody, a sociologist quoted in Gazeta Wyborcza, the
country's largest-circulation newspaper, compared the government's
attitude to that of a plumber who comes to repair bathroom fixtures that
were dismantled by another worker. Instead of getting to work, he spends
three months complaining what a mess his predecessor left--and promising
that the leaks will stop when EU membership is achieved.</TE>
<TE>   Prominent commentator Rafal Ziemkiewicz wrote in Rzeczpospolita that
the government didn't expect "its statements aimed at simple folk"
pressuring the bank "would be taken seriously by foreign investors and
high officials of the European Union."</TE>
<TE>   "Since the independence of the central bank is a standard recognized
worldwide," he added, "Leszek Miller's government suddenly found itself
criticized by those whose opinion it really values."</TE>
<TE>   Ziemkiewicz argued that the government now has little choice but to
seek "some compromise allowing it to get out of this affair without
losing face."</TE>

<HD>A Care Package for Afghan Animals</HD>
<DH>Aid: The Kabul Zoo has dwindled from about 380 animals to 30.
Foreign funds are helping to nurse the survivors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Marjan, the blind and crippled lion, got his first dose of
deworming medicine. Samboo, the bear who was so terrified by recent
bombing that he scraped off much of his nose on the bars of his cage, ate
apples smeared with antibiotics.</LD>
<LD>   The 28 other animals surviving in the blasted-out Kabul Zoo are in
line for initial treatments over the next week, after the first
international aid for them began arriving Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "We are so happy" to have medicine and assistance, said the zoo's
veterinarian, 40-year-old Abdul Qadir. "Whenever the animals got hurt, we
felt that pain in our own bodies. . . . We couldn't help them."</LD>
<TE>   Marjan, especially, has become a symbol to much of the world of the
miseries and violence Afghanistan has endured.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, a man demonstrating his fearlessness to friends leaped the
fence and went to pet the lion, according to head zookeeper Shir Agha
Omar. He did, and Marjan sat still. When the man attempted to touch
Marjan's mate, who has since died, Marjan rammed him so hard he died
without ever being mauled or bitten.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, the dead man's brother came back and tossed a grenade
into the lion's pen, blinding Marjan in both eyes, mutilating his face
and injuring his hind legs.</TE>
<TE>   Stories and pictures of the crippled lion, sent around the world after
the Taliban fled Kabul, the capital, have prompted people to donate an
estimated $1 million. U.S. zookeepers and animal lovers have raised
$400,000. Three British newspapers competed with one another to raise
funds, believed to total in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, while
groups from China, Germany, Australia and other countries also have
gathered contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan has no banks, an ongoing war and rampant banditry, so the
only aid that has arrived so far came over the weekend in the suitcases
of John Walsh of the London-based World Society for the Protection of
Animals, or WSPA.</TE>
<TE>   The lion was Walsh's first patient, the bear his second. One
diminutive Afghan antelope, two porcupines, two Asian wildcats, five
monkeys, eight eagles and 10 other creatures--not counting a swarm of
small birds and a hutch of rabbits--are still to be treated.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo had about 380 animals in the early 1990s when it first found
itself on the front lines of a war among rival warlords, some of whom
went on to lead the Northern Alliance. An elephant, chained to the
ground, was killed when a rocket demolished its brick pen. Several ponies
died in a mortar attack. Many other animals were killed as the vast
majority of the zoo was leveled. Most of those that survived later
perished from malnutrition and untreated illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Marjan, believed to be about 23 years old, lived, only to be maimed.
On Monday, Walsh dewormed the lion, treated him with other medications
and quickly laid out a plan to heat and improve his pen. The blind lion
sometimes finds his way about by walking headfirst into brick walls, then
turning.</TE>
<TE>   After tending to Marjan, Walsh headed for the cage of Samboo, an
endangered Asiatic black bear, whose nose is believed to have been first
cut by a Taliban knife and then severely damaged as he dragged it along
his cage's bars during the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Studying media images of the small bear's face, WSPA veterinarians in
Europe and the U.S. concluded that the best treatment would be a skin
graft. But Walsh decided that Samboo would probably rub the new skin off,
and so he turned to a simpler approach: feeding the bear the
medicine-laced apples and trying with limited success to lure him close
enough to squirt antibiotics onto his raw snout.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have to come up with a different system," Walsh said
after coaxing the frightened bear with tuna but mostly missing with the
antibiotic gel.</TE>
<TE>   Like almost everyone in this country, the 11 workers at the zoo have
not been paid in a long time, six months in most cases.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to get the rebuilding effort going, and to make sure the
workers wouldn't be tempted to take meat meant for the animals home to
their families, Walsh brought along enough cash to cover the unpaid
wages. The total came to $3,600.</TE>
<TE>   The zookeepers and WSPA have already come up with plans for
improvements, from erecting signs that instruct local children, who have
grown up with war, not to throw rocks at the animals, to constructing a
complete veterinary clinic. Two veterinarians from the WSPA are due to
arrive today, along with about 10,000 pounds of medicine, food and
supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan is only a step from renewed chaos, so the plan also calls
for stockpiling high-calorie animal feed in case fighting in the southern
part of the country works its way back here.</TE>
<TE>   Agha Omar, the head zookeeper, has come without pay almost every day
for more than eight years to feed the animals whatever food was
available. No matter what the future holds, he said, he will continue.</TE>

<LD>An American on a humanitarian mission in Afghanistan was taken

Pepperdine University and managed Rohrabacher's first run for office, in
1988, called his wife Wednesday from Afghanistan to report that he had
been stopped by a group of Afghans and robbed of his belongings,
including cash and a satellite phone. He said the group had taken him and
an Afghan interpreter hostage until the ransom was paid, the sources
said.</LD>
<LD>   "The motive was strictly monetary," said a family member who asked not
to be identified.</LD>
<TE>   Bowers, 37, was on his second mission in Afghanistan in about two
months. On both occasions, he was delivering medical supplies and other
humanitarian goods collected by private individuals, his family said.</TE>
<TE>   Bowers arrived early last week on a chartered plane from Istanbul,
Turkey. He told his wife during a minute-long conversation that his
plane, bound for the Afghan capital, Kabul, had been diverted at the last
minute, so he was not sure of his location, the family member said.</TE>
<TE>   He was held for a day or two before being allowed to contact his
family by another satellite phone.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first known case of an American taken hostage since the
new Afghan government took office last month, but the abduction is part
of a growing crime problem in the nation since the Taliban regime was
ousted.</TE>
<TE>   Bowers said he thought he was being held by tribal warlords, but he
either did not know their identities or could not identify them for his
family.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department said Monday that it was investigating. "We are
aware of the reports about the supposed hostage-taking of an American in
Afghanistan. We are in touch with his wife," a spokesman in the
department's consular affairs office said.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is working through the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad,
Pakistan, and other agencies "to try to determine whatever we can about
the individual's welfare and whereabouts," the spokesman said. Because of
U.S. privacy laws, the State Department would not talk about the identity
of the American or the specifics of the case.</TE>
<TE>   Bowers is from Harvest, Ala. He is a self-employed political
consultant who has been active in Republican politics since the Reagan
administration, according to his family.</TE>
<TE>   In their phone conversation, Bowers told his wife that he was being
treated fairly well but that the captors had roughed up his interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan's interim prime minister, Hamid Karzai, has pledged to
restore security to Afghanistan, but without a police force or funds to
pay them, vast areas of the country are lawless. Shakedowns on roadsides
are an increasingly common problem, while bribes have become a part of
daily life, particularly for foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   A Swedish television cameraman was a victim of Afghanistan's
lawlessness in late November when thieves broke into his house and shot
him dead. Since the war began Oct. 7, seven other journalists have been
killed.</TE>
<TE>   During the Taliban's rule, several journalists were held after they
sneaked into the country. Eight Christian aid workers, including two
Americans, were arrested on charges of proselytizing but were rescued as
the Taliban government collapsed.</TE>

<LD>An Egyptian man who arrived at John F. Kennedy International
Airport with a fake pilot's uniform and license and a forged
flight-school certificate a week after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
went on trial in federal court on charges of lying to authorities.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors have acknowledged they have no evidence that Wael Abdel
Rahman Kishk, 21, was part of a potential "second wave" of attacks but
said he acted suspiciously.</LD>
<LD>   Kishk lied to federal agents by claiming he was in the country to
attend business school when he really intended to take flying lessons,
prosecutor Dwight Holton said in opening statements.</LD>
<TE>   Defense attorney Michael Schneider said Kishk, who held a legitimate
U.S. visa, meant no harm. He described the pilot's document as "the
crudest kind of fake"--the work of a young man who wanted to impress a
girlfriend.</TE>

warned Americans they could be targeted by terrorists. Yemeni security
officials stepped up protection of the compound, saying a specific threat
had been received.</LD>

an increased terrorist threat to U.S. interests in Yemen, including the
U.S. Embassy."</LD>

<LD>Osama bin Laden met an Iranian intelligence officer in the
mid-1990s to try to forge an alliance to conduct a terrorism campaign
against the United States, according to a new book by a former CIA
officer.</LD>
<LD>   Bin Laden met an Iranian intelligence officer in Afghanistan in July
1996 to "hammer out a strategic relationship," Robert Baer, a former CIA
operative in the Middle East and Tajikistan, writes in "See No Evil," due
out this week.</LD>
<LD>   Tajik Islamic chieftain Abdallah Nuri, who operated out of
Afghanistan, brokered the alliance, the book says, and at least one
meeting between Bin Laden and the Iranian intelligence officer occurred.
The Iranian was not identified.</LD>

<HD>Afghan Caves Daunt the U.S.</HD>
<DH>War: The more troops see of the mountainous region, Joint Chiefs
deputy says, the bigger the challenge of rooting out Al Qaeda seems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The extensive Al Qaeda training complex that U.S. warplanes have
been pounding since Jan. 3 is one of dozens in dry, cave-riddled valleys
of southeastern Afghanistan where groups of terrorist fighters may be
hiding, a senior Pentagon official said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Rear Adm. John D. Stufflebeem, deputy director of operations for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said there are so many of the complexes--not
simply cave hideaways but compounds with large, above-ground training
camps--that the work is overwhelming the small number of special
operations troops locating them and calling in airstrikes.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't have the number of forces on the ground that are going to
get through all of them," Stufflebeem said. "So it's a matter of priority
which ones appear to be the ones we want to go look at now."</LD>
<TE>   The more the U.S. military learns about the region around the Zhawar
Kili al Badr training camp, the bigger the task of shutting the complexes
down seems, Stufflebeem said.</TE>
<TE>   "This entire part of the country is riddled with hillsides and valleys
of caves and above-ground structures," he said. " . . . Therefore, there
are likely other valleys with other complexes, and they, in fact, may
very well have [Al Qaeda militants]."</TE>
<TE>   As Stufflebeem spoke Monday, airstrikes on Zhawar Kili were tapering
off. Over the weekend, B-52 and B-1 bombers and F/A-18 Navy jet fighters
pummeled the camp, using precision bombs to blow up cave entrances and
level buildings in an area of more than three square miles.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's bombing appeared to be the heaviest since last month's
strikes on the cave complex at Tora Bora to the northeast.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why the Zhawar Kili complex, the same camp hit by cruise
missiles in 1998 in an unsuccessful attempt to kill Osama bin Laden and
his top aides, had not been thoroughly destroyed earlier, Stufflebeem
said the Pentagon had been surprised at its size.</TE>
<TE>   "We just didn't know how extensive it was," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The camp contains more than 60 buildings and more than 50 caves, he
said, many high in the walls of cliffs and accessible only by experienced
climbers.</TE>
<TE>   The site was first struck by U.S. warplanes shortly after the air war
began Oct. 7. But on Jan. 3, after intelligence reports indicated that it
had become a refuge for Al Qaeda leaders seeking to regroup, strikes on
the training camp began in earnest.</TE>
<TE>   Stufflebeem said the bombing has been painstakingly slow, with special
operations teams first locating and searching each cave and building in
the now-abandoned complex for intelligence on terrorist activities. Then
they direct U.S. warplanes where to strike and whether or not to
eradicate any structures.</TE>
<TE>   As U.S. intelligence analysts pondered their next move, the U.N.
special envoy to Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, joined a growing chorus
calling for an immediate infusion of cash to keep the interim government
of Prime Minister Hamid Karzai from collapsing.</TE>
<TE>   The nation needs money "immediately, not next year," said Ahmed Fawzi,
Brahimi's spokesman in the capital, Kabul. "This country needs millions
of dollars tomorrow. Otherwise, there will be no country when the
billions are ready."</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of countries pledged in December to donate a combined $20
million to get the government up and running, but less than half of that
has been wired to a special bank account, Fawzi said, and little is
believed to have made its way to Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The country has about 210,000 civil servants and 25,000 police
officers, the vast majority of whom have not been paid in six months.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't buy bread," Fawzi said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is considering releasing Afghan assets that were frozen
following the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, but it is unclear how much money might be involved and how
quickly the release might take place.</TE>
<TE>   For the longer term, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has said that
rebuilding the country might take $8 billion over the next three to five
years. Afghan reconstruction will be taken up at an international
conference next week in Tokyo that Powell will attend.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan reopened its embassy in Kabul on Monday and pledged $100
million to help rebuild Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Refugees continued to return from Pakistan to some northern areas of
Afghanistan, as others in the south continued to flee. About 13,000
people have now fled the southern provinces because of bombing, destroyed
homes and drought, according to the World Food Program. The refugees are
just across the border in Pakistan, but the Pakistani government has not
allowed them to move farther inland.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan already has more than 3 million Afghan refugees and has
resisted accepting more. The 13,000 are stranded on an open plain with
little shelter or food, where nighttime temperatures dip below freezing,
said World Food Program spokesman Jordan Dey.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan, which is entering its fourth year of drought, has just
received a much-needed storm that dumped heavy snow in several mountain
ranges. The skies cleared across most of the country Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Half a world away, at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 30
more Al Qaeda prisoners arrived at a high-security jail, the Pentagon
announced, joining 20 flown there last week.</TE>
<TE>   All the prisoners arrived from the southern Afghan city of Kandahar,
but they include at least three British nationals, officials said Monday
night. There was no further word on their identities.</TE>
<TE>   The Kandahar airport is the site of the main detention center for Al
Qaeda and Taliban prisoners from the war. Officials said 464 are now in
U.S. custody--413 in Afghanistan, the 50 in Cuba and American John Walker
Lindh on the amphibious assault ship Bataan in the Arabian Sea.</TE>

<HD>Medical Examiner Rules Biologist's Death the Result of Accidental
Fall From Bridge</HD>
<DH>Mystery: Scientist's body was found in the Mississippi River.
Autopsy suggests he was impaired before plunge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDITH STANLEY</AU>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA
</DL>
<LD>A prominent Harvard University biologist, whose body was found in
the Mississippi River last month five weeks after he had mysteriously
disappeared from a medical conference in Memphis, died accidentally when
he fell from a bridge after a minor auto mishap, a medical examiner
reported Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The finding, issued in Memphis, ruled out murder and suicide, and
suggested that Don C. Wiley, 57, was impaired that night and tumbled over
the bridge's railing, which was only about 3 1/2 feet high. His body was
recovered from the river on Dec. 20 about 300 miles south of Memphis.</LD>
<LD>   He fell 135 feet from the Hernando DeSoto Bridge, less than a mile
from the hotel where he had just attended a meeting and banquet. The
medical examiner said that Wiley died after striking a beam on the way
down and hitting the water at a speed greater than 60 mph, causing
fractures and paralysis.</LD>
<TE>   Wiley's disappearance Nov. 16--when the nation was preoccupied with
fears of anthrax--raised questions about whether his death was related to
bioterrorism. He was a nationally known expert on a number of viruses,
including Ebola, which scientists believe could be used in terrorist
attacks. The FBI initially showed interest in the case.</TE>
<TE>   But in a report issued in Memphis, Shelby County Medical Examiner O.C.
Smith said that Wiley had "an infrequent and poorly understood seizure
disorder" that he kept private and for which he was not being treated.</TE>
<TE>   Stress, fatigue and alcohol can bring on the disorder, Smith said. The
medical examiner noted that Wiley's rental car appeared to have hit a
construction sign and the bridge itself. He may have gotten out to
inspect the damage.</TE>
<TE>   "It will never be known if this disorder or drowsy driving [was] due
to the late hour and long day Dr. Wiley had put in, or [if] the effects
of alcohol he was seen to imbibe earlier contributed to the incident on
the bridge," the medical examiner said in his report.</TE>
<TE>   "Toxicology studies are not yet complete, but alcohol has been
identified at levels suggesting impairment," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said the alcohol level in Wiley's body was 0.17%, but he
stressed that this measurement was from the chest cavity and not from
blood because no blood remained in Wiley's vessels.</TE>
<TE>   "I would defy any expert," said Smith, "who would come up with a solid
number that would adequately define what his true blood-alcohol was at
the time of the mishap."</TE>
<TE>   Smith added that suicide had been ruled out after a review of Wiley's
medical records and past behavior.</TE>
<TE>   The report raised the possibility that a passing 18-wheel truck may
have caused the roadway to bounce or produced a gust of wind which could
have contributed to Wiley's fall.</TE>
<TE>   In Cambridge, Mass., Wiley's widow, Katrin Valgeirsdottir, said only,
"I'm glad it's over." She declined to discuss her husband's medical
condition.</TE>
<TE>   Smith stressed that Wiley's family had been "very forthcoming" about
his medical history.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Wiley was very, very private with regard to this condition," the
medical examiner said. "He never had it worked up medically. He was never
taking any medication for it. It was something that happened relatively
infrequently, and he tried to handle it himself."</TE>
<TE>   Smith said the condition could appear after vigorous physical activity
such as running. "What we looked for very closely in the autopsy, in the
investigation of the bridge and of the vehicle, were signs of just what
actually occurred," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact he had two mishaps with the vehicle suggested some sort of
impairment," the medical examiner added.</TE>
<TE>   Wiley, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics at Harvard whose
work focused on the structure of viruses and proteins in the immune
system, was reported missing Nov. 16.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, he won the prestigious Japan Prize with his Harvard
colleague, professor Jack L. Strominger, for discoveries related to the
functioning of the body's immune system. Wiley had traveled to Memphis to
attend a two-day meeting of the scientific advisory board of the St. Jude
Children's Research Hospital.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>Ending a monthlong international manhunt, federal authorities said
Monday they arrested an Oregon man, accused of murdering his wife and
three children, after he was found living in a grass hut on a beach near
Cancun, Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   Christian Michael Longo, 27, was taken into custody over the weekend
by Mexican authorities and handed over to FBI agents, who escorted him on
a Continental Airlines passenger flight to Houston.</LD>
<LD>   Longo faces four counts of aggravated murder in Oregon.</LD>
<TE>   The fugitive, who was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list, is believed
to have fled the small coastal town of Newport, Ore., for San Francisco
after the killings. Longo was tracked down to a beach camp on the Mexican
coast after a Montreal woman on vacation in Mexico spotted a photo of him
upon her return and tipped off authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Longo, who had earlier been living in a Mexican youth hostel, admitted
police had the right man and agreed to return to the U.S., a move that
averted formal extradition proceedings. That eliminates any potential
obstacle to seeking the death penalty in Oregon, because Mexico generally
does not extradite people who face a possible death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   At Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Longo arrived Monday
morning wearing jeans, a gray T-shirt and a long plaid over-shirt,
resembling photos posted on the FBI's Web site, except his strawberry
blond hair had grown slightly longer. He was led handcuffed by FBI agents
and Houston police officers out of the terminal and into a waiting
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "He's booked in the Houston County Jail, and he will have an
extradition hearing" today, said Dana Fernandez, clerk at the Harrison
County Criminal Court. She said Longo is scheduled to appear at 9 a.m.
before Judge Sherman Ross.</TE>
<TE>   The family of Longo's wife, Mary Jane, 34, expressed relief.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't help anything else, but I'm glad that he's in custody,"
said her mother, Susan Lowery of Trinity, Ala. "It was a worry to me when
he was loose. Family members didn't know if he was going to come after
them, or me, or whatever."</TE>
<TE>   The arrest ended an intense search for a man who was thought to be a
loving father to his three children. The body of Zachary, 4, was found
Dec. 19 floating in a slough near the family's condominium; 3-year-old
Sadie's body was found submerged about 150 feet away. The bodies of Mary
Jane and 2-year-old daughter Madison were discovered by divers in the
same inlet near the Pacific Ocean on Dec. 27.</TE>
<TE>   The family had recently moved to scenic Newport, Ore., after leaving
behind a string of financial problems in Michigan. Longo, who had opened
a construction cleanup firm in Michigan's Washtenaw County in February
2000, was subsequently placed on probation on charges of forgery and
writing bad checks, then charged with larceny in a case whose outcome is
unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Family members said Longo always lived beyond his means, buying
expensive clothes, boats and vacations without any apparent ability to
pay the bills.</TE>
<TE>   Longo worked at a local Starbucks in Newport, where the family rented
a condominium on Yaquina Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Longo was spotted several times in San Francisco late in December and
is believed to have purchased a ticket from San Francisco to Cancun on
Dec. 27, according to the FBI. He was featured on the Fox television show
"America's Most Wanted" on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Mathews, special agent in charge of the FBI in Portland, Ore.,
said the key break in the case came when the Montreal woman told
authorities she recognized Longo as a man who went by the name of Brad
staying at a hostel there.</TE>
<TE>   An investigation by the U.S. Embassy in Mexico revealed that Longo had
been asked to leave the hostel about Jan. 7. "Apparently there was money
stolen from other people at the youth hostel, [and] although it was not
directly associated with him, he left shortly after that," Mathews said.
Longo discussed with other hostel guests the possibility of going to the
village of Tulum, 60 miles south of Cancun, Mathews said.</TE>
<TE>   About 20 officers from the state judicial police closed in on a beach
camp at Tulum, where Longo was living under the name of Michael Longo.
"He acknowledged his identity to the law enforcement officers," Mathews
said, and agreed to waive extradition proceedings and accompany FBI
agents to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln County Dist. Atty. Bernice Barnett said extradition from Texas
to Oregon could take several weeks, unless Longo waives that proceeding.
"If he waives extradition, officers from Lincoln County are ready to
transport him back to Oregon at the first opportunity," she said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   She said the decision whether to seek the death penalty has already
been made but will not be announced until Longo appears in court in
Oregon. The state voted overwhelmingly to reinstate the death penalty in
1984, but since then has used it only twice.</TE>
<TE>   Longo's family said they are "pleased" he was located so quickly. "As
these events have unfolded over the last couple of weeks, the only thing
more difficult than the answers has been the uncertainty," the family
said in a statement. "Perhaps now the family can begin to understand what
happened, and we may be able to have some kind of closure."</TE>
<TE>   The arrest and hand-over marked an improved climate of cooperation
between the U.S. and Mexico. The number of fugitives returned from Mexico
jumped from 15 in 2000 to about 70 last year, according to Josie Shumake,
a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman in Mexico City.</TE>

<HD>N.J. Troopers Lose Jobs but Avoid Jail in Shooting</HD>

<BD>From Associated Pres</BD>
<DL>TRENTON, N.J.
</DL>
<LD>Two white state troopers avoided jail Monday by pleading guilty to
lesser charges in a turnpike shooting that forced New Jersey and the
nation to confront the issue of ethnic profiling.</LD>
<LD>   The men said they had been trained and encouraged by their superiors
to target minorities.</LD>
<LD>   James Kenna and John Hogan fired 11 shots at a van they had pulled
over for speeding on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1998. The two have said
they thought the driver was trying to run them over and they feared for
their lives. Three of the four young men--three blacks and one Latino--in
the van were wounded.</LD>
<TE>   Under a plea bargain, Kenna and Hogan pleaded guilty to official
misconduct and providing false information. Kenna had been charged with
attempted murder, and both had been charged with aggravated assault.</TE>
<TE>   Kenna and Hogan were fined $155 each for official misconduct and $125
each for giving false information, and were barred from holding jobs as
police officers in New Jersey. The plea agreement also avoids federal
civil rights charges.</TE>
<TE>   As he left the courthouse, Kenna said he had a message for the four
young men, who did not attend the hearing. "I've been thinking about you
ever since this occurred," he said softly, speaking to TV cameras. "I'm
sorry."</TE>
<TE>   The turnpike shooting stirred accusations that New Jersey state police
targeted minority motorists for searches along the busy highway.</TE>
<TE>   A year after the shooting, former state Atty. Gen. Peter G. Verniero
admitted that troopers practiced profiling.</TE>
<TE>   Under an agreement to prevent a lawsuit by the U.S. Justice
Department, the state ordered reforms, including steps to monitor the
ethnicity of motorists stopped by troopers. The state also agreed to pay
$12.95 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the four men who were
targeted.</TE>
<TE>   Minority activists criticized the plea bargain.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have just witnessed today was not justice," said the Rev.
Reginald Jackson, executive director of the Black Ministers Council of
New Jersey. "What we have just witnessed was political expedience."</TE>

<HD>Bush's New Domestic Priority: Chew Slowly</HD>
<DH>Health: The president emerges with his face bruised but his humor
intact after choking on a pretzel and fainting.</DH>

<DL>AURORA, Mo.
</DL>
<LD>With one quip after another, President Bush on Monday made light of
the fainting spell he suffered while watching football on television in
the White House the day before.</LD>
<LD>   "My mother always said, 'When you're eating pretzels, chew before you
swallow.' Listen to your mother," the president joked as he left the
White House on a two-day trip to the Midwest and the South to promote
trade.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel great, looking forward to a good trip," Bush said.</LD>
<TE>   The president was in his third-floor bedroom, with only his two dogs
for company, when a pretzel he ate evidently did not go down quite right,
according to White House physician Richard Tubb.</TE>
<TE>   Bush briefly lost consciousness, apparently striking his head on a
coffee table as he fell from the couch. The frame of his glasses was bent
when he regained consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Bush had a half-dollar-sized bruise on his left cheek that
was noticeable even under makeup.</TE>
<TE>   "I was--I hit the deck, and woke up and there was Barney and Spot
showing a lot of concern," Bush said when asked what had happened. "I
didn't realize what happened till I looked in the mirror; my glasses cut
my side of my face."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "I feel great, had good blood pressure last night, good
blood pressure this morning."</TE>
<TE>   Tubb reexamined the president at the White House early Monday morning
and declared that his vital signs "all checked out normal," said Ari
Fleischer, the president's press secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Tubb told reporters Sunday night that Bush had been experiencing a
head cold for a couple of days.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said Monday that Bush was "still a little under the
weather," suffering from a runny nose, but the president told employees
of John Deere Harvester Works in East Moline, Ill., that he was "feeling
great."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, aboard Air Force One as it left Washington, reporters in the
back of the plane received a gigantic bag of bite-size pretzels with a
scribbled note: "From POTUS--chew slowly." (POTUS is the acronym for
President of the United States.)</TE>
<TE>   Before leaving East Moline, Bush met privately with supporters from
Illinois and neighboring Iowa. Then he flew to Springfield, Mo., where he
addressed residents at the airport, followed by a visit with farmers at
the Missouri Farmers Assn. Feed Mill in nearby Aurora.</TE>
<TE>   To emphasize the importance of free trade and the global economy, Bush
is tracing the route of farm products from the heartland to New Orleans,
where they are shipped overseas.</TE>
<TE>   In his wide-ranging remarks, the president broke no new ground on
either foreign or domestic policy. He reiterated the rationale for the
war against terrorism and urged Americans to be patient. Bush also
forcefully restated his determination to see through the 10-year,
$1.35-trillion tax cut, which some Democrats want to scale back in light
of the fast-rising budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he called on Congress to enact an economic stimulus bill,
saying: "That will give a little extra oomph to an economic recovery that
I hope is beginning to happen."</TE>
<TE>   The president's first stop was at the John Deere Harvester Works. Its
parent company, Deere &amp; Co., makes farm equipment, does business in 160
nations and employs about 40,000 people around the world.</TE>
<TE>   From here, Bush went on to New Orleans, where he is scheduled to visit
the Port of New Orleans today.</TE>
<TE>   The trip is part of a White House plan to showcase the president's
domestic priorities in the weeks before Bush's Jan. 29 State of the Union
address.</TE>

<HD>Corps of Engineers Relaxes Wetland Protections</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration weakened federal protections for wetlands
on Monday, making it easier for developers to build on land where streams
flow part of the year.</LD>
<LD>   This was one of several changes the Army Corps of Engineers made to
wetland regulations that specify when developers can seek "nationwide
permits," which are shortcuts that enable them to begin their projects
more quickly and with fewer restrictions.</LD>
<LD>   For example, the new rules could allow a developer, using a shortcut
permit, to fill in 1,000 feet of a 20-foot-wide seasonal stream. Under
the old rules, the limit was 300 feet.</LD>
<TE>   The corps had proposed a more extensive rollback of wetland rules in
its draft report in August but curtailed those plans amid intense
criticism from inside and outside the government.</TE>
<TE>   Corps officials in Washington and Los Angeles said new rules represent
a limited shift and that the agency is committed to protecting the health
of the nation's waterways and wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   "The changes are quite minor," said John Studt, chief of regulations
at the corps.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists disagree, calling the changes further proof that the
Bush administration is systematically weakening rules created to protect
the nation's dwindling supply of wetlands, swamps and stream beds.
Wetlands are key to the welfare of fish and waterfowl and also help
cleanse water and control flooding.</TE>
<TE>   The Clean Water Act gives the corps the authority to decide when and
how to issue permits allowing developers to destroy wetlands and streams.
Such fragile landscapes can be especially attractive to developers
because they offer the allure of water views or access. But the United
States already has lost more than half its historic wetlands, making the
corps' power to grant permits a lightning rod for environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   The new rule on so-called intermittent streams would allow a developer
to fill more stream area with less red tape.</TE>
<TE>   This rule could have a significant effect in California, where
wildlife and plants depend on the temporary flow of storm runoff and
seasonal flows to stay alive.</TE>
<TE>   The corps also eased a rule requiring developers to protect or create
one acre of wetlands for every acre they destroy. Instead, corps
engineers will have the authority to waive the requirement altogether, or
to allow developers to plant trees instead of restoring wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   "California in particular needs to be worried about these rule
changes, because California has lost over 91% of our wetlands already,
more than any other state," said Kevin Doyle, director of habitat
conservation programs for the National Wildlife Federation's western
field office. "When is the corps going to put its foot down?"</TE>
<TE>   Before the corps announced its plans, the Fish and Wildlife Service
and the Environmental Protection Agency joined environmentalists in
complaining that the new rules could endanger wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   The corps reinstated some of the environmental protections that had
been removed in the draft version, which would have given district
engineers the authority to allow quicker permitting for all streams--even
ones that flow year-round.</TE>
<TE>   The agency also said it remained committed to the goal of preventing a
net loss of wetlands. Although the agency gave its 37 district engineers
leeway to let developers destroy existing wetlands without creating or
restoring other wetlands elsewhere, it also ordered these same engineers
to document that there would be no net loss of wetlands in their
districts.</TE>
<TE>   Some districts are small, encompassing several counties, but others
include several states. The Los Angeles district stretches east into New
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Developers welcomed what they said is much-needed flexibility in the
rules, and they said they are hoping the administration will continue to
roll back onerous regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "California home builders need as much flexibility as possible to
build homes," said Brian White, legislative representative for the
California Building Industry Assn. "We look forward to working with the
administration for more changes."</TE>
<TE>   Intermittent stream beds are filled by seasonal rainfall and ground
water. About 10% of the Southern California streams feeding into the
ocean are intermittent, according to the corps' L.A. office.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Southern California's streams are so-called ephemeral
streams--dry washes that flow only after storms. Most of the state's
intermittent streams are found in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Durham, South Coast section chief in the regulatory branch of the
corps' Los Angeles district office, defended the change in the rules,
saying the old 300-foot limit on filling intermittent streams was
impractical.</TE>

<HD>Study Links Head Injury, Depression</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>Concussions and other head injuries in early adulthood may
significantly raise the risk of depression decades later, a study of
World War II veterans found.</LD>
<LD>   The study has disturbing implications for football and hockey players,
motorcyclists and others who have taken blows to the head.</LD>
<LD>   Other research has shown that head trauma patients may be prone to
depression shortly after suffering their injuries. But the new findings
suggest that the risk persists even 50 years later.</LD>
<TE>   The study involved 1,718 veterans hospitalized for various ailments
during the war and questioned 50 years later. About 11% who had had head
injuries said they currently had major depression, compared with 8.5% of
those hospitalized during the war for other reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the lifetime prevalence of major depression was 18.5% in the
head-injury group and 13.4% among the other veterans, Drs. Tracey
Holsinger and Brenda Plassman of Duke University and their colleagues
reported in January's Archives of General Psychiatry.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers found similar depression rates in veterans who had
received their head injuries in combat and in those whose injuries
occurred elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Plassman said the findings could mean that people who suffer head
injuries today--for example, football players or motorcyclists--will have
a greater risk of depression.</TE>
<TE>   While it is unclear how head injury is related to depression,
Holsinger and colleagues offer some theories. Depression has been linked
with dysfunction in the brain's frontal region, and research has
suggested a strong link between depression and head trauma resulting in
lesions in the frontal region, the researchers said.</TE>

<HD>Protected Shrimp Nets a Victory</HD>
<DH>Environment: The Supreme Court rejects a challenge to the
freshwater species' endangered status.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The tiny fairy shrimp, which lives in rainwater ponds in
California's Central Valley, won a victory of sorts Monday at the Supreme
Court, as the justices turned away a challenge to its federal protection
as an endangered species.</LD>
<LD>   It marked the third time in recent years that the high court has
refused to limit the federal government's power to protect wildlife.
Property rights advocates have been eager for the court's conservative
justices to reconsider the reach of the Endangered Species Act.</LD>
<LD>   The Constitution gives Congress the power to "regulate commerce . . .
among the several states," and lawmakers relied on this power in passing
the federal environmental laws.</LD>
<TE>   But the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, has
moved to put limits on this power. In 1995, the court struck down on a
5-4 vote a federal law that made it illegal to have a gun near a school.
Two years ago, the court struck down a second law that gave rape victims
a right to sue their attackers in federal court. In both instances,
Rehnquist said that because gun possession and sexual assault do not
involve interstate commerce, Congress had no power to make them federal
offenses.</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of Central Valley ranchers and builders said the same
logic should apply to the fairy shrimp.</TE>
<TE>   The "tiny, fly-sized freshwater crustaceans are found only in
California," they said, and "they have no commercial purpose." Therefore,
the builders argued, federal wildlife regulators should not have the
authority to protect these shrimp and their habitat from being destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Endangered Species Act, those who kill a threatened animal
or destroy its environment are subject to fines and criminal penalties.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, this argument has failed to win the votes of at least four
Supreme Court justices, the minimum needed to take up an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department lawyers and most lower-court judges have taken a
broad view of the environment. They say Congress has the power to protect
endangered wildlife in general, and this includes insects, rodents and
crustaceans as well as the majestic bald eagle.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, the Supreme Court turned away a similar challenge that
focused on the Delhi Sands flower-loving fly, a short and fat insect that
spends most of its life buried in the sand dunes of San Bernardino
County.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Washington lawyer Theodore B. Olson, representing some
North Carolina farmers, urged the court to reconsider the broad federal
protection for the endangered red wolf. The justices turned away that
appeal as well, and probably spared Olson a headache. Shortly afterward,
he became President Bush's solicitor general, whose job involves
defending federal laws and agencies before the high court.</TE>
<TE>   Had the court taken up the red wolf case, Olson's government office
would have been charged with defending the federal red wolf protection
program.</TE>
<TE>   Olson recused himself in the case of the fairy shrimp, and his deputy,
Paul D. Clements, filed a brief urging the justices to reject the appeal.
The court did so in a one-line order in the case of Building Industry
Assn. of Superior California vs. Norton, 01-620.</TE>
<TE>   It was not the only wildlife drama at the court Monday.</TE>
<TE>   A court police officer on duty Sunday reported seeing a red fox scoot
down the driveway into the underground garage. And a security camera
recorded the sighting.</TE>
<TE>   No one could figure out why a fox was loose in the Capitol Hill area,
or why the animal chose to run into the building. Animal control officers
for the District of Columbia were called, and members of a Virginia
fox-hunting club joined in, to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   "It's possible that it slipped out undetected, but we're still
checking," said court spokeswoman Kathleen Arberg.</TE>

<HD>No Consensus on Why People Try to Flee From Police</HD>
<DH>Pursuits: Small-time offenders who suddenly decide to bolt only
compound their woes. One psychologist calls them 'bad risk-takers.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is the question that viewers of televised police pursuits have
to ask as they watch yet another speeding driver desperately trying to
outrun a squadron of police cars and helicopters:</LD>
<LD>   What are these people thinking?</LD>
<LD>   Sacramento County Sheriff's Capt. John McGinness, a police pursuit
expert, said even law enforcement officials haven't figured out the
answer. "The consensus is there is no consensus," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Research shows that motorists who put their life, limbs and liberty on
the line--not to mention those of hundreds of others--usually flee after
committing minor driving offenses. Their flight, which is inevitably
futile, exposes them to much greater punishment than the original crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "They are bad risk-takers," said Adrian Raine, a psychologist and USC
professor who specializes in criminal behavior. "They take some risks
that they shouldn't."</TE>
<TE>   In a 1997 federal survey of 146 prisoners in three states, more than
half said they were willing to run from police at all costs. And 64%
believed they would not be caught. (That the survey was taken behind bars
suggests they were wrong.)</TE>
<TE>   More than three in five drivers who flee are suspected only of
misdemeanors. The most common offense triggering pursuits statewide from
1995 to 2000 was speeding, linked to 15% of all chases, according to
California Highway Patrol records. The other crimes that sparked the most
chases were car theft (11%), reckless driving (4%), drunk driving (4%)
and failing to stop at a stop sign (3%).</TE>
<TE>   Tanya Marie Ferguson, 29, epitomizes the small-time offender whose
sudden decision to bolt only compounded her woes.</TE>
<TE>   On the evening of July 16, Ferguson walked into a Stater Bros. store
in Claremont with a teenage friend. A salesclerk saw Ferguson and the
teen each walk out with a package of diapers without paying. In the
parking lot, the clerk signaled a passing police car about the theft.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson jumped behind the wheel of her Jeep Wrangler. The vehicle was
packed: The teenage friend had two children in the back seat and another
adult friend had a third toddler in the vehicle. None of the children was
strapped into child safety seats.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson gunned the engine and the chase was on.</TE>
<TE>   For 45 minutes, Ferguson sped helter-skelter around Claremont at more
than 90 mph, a caravan of police cars in tow. Two airborne television
crews caught most of the chase for broadcast that evening.</TE>
<TE>   When the Jeep ran out of gas on the San Bernardino Freeway, Ferguson
jumped out and ran right into late-evening traffic before police finally
forced her to the ground at gunpoint.</TE>
<TE>   Had she given up at the market, the diaper theft and a charge of
driving with a suspended license would have cost her a maximum of one
year in jail and a $2,800 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the unemployed high school dropout was charged with three
felony child abuse counts and a felony evading arrest charge, to go with
the original accusations. After tearfully pleading no contest to all
charges last month, Ferguson faces a maximum of 10 years and six months
in prison when she returns to court next month.</TE>
<TE>   Why she ran remains unclear, even to her family.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, Patricia Ferguson, asked her daughter why she fled. Tanya
couldn't explain.</TE>
<TE>   "She said she doesn't know what she was thinking," the mother said,
adding: "Why would you do such a thing unless you were out of your
freakin' mind?"</TE>

<LD>\o7 A consumer's guide to the best and worst of sports media and
merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, played, heard, observed,
worn, viewed, dialed or downloaded, it's in play here.</LD>
<LD>\f7    What: "The American Dirt Track Racer"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Joe Scalzo</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Motorbooks International</TE>
<TE>   Price: $39.95</TE>
<TE>   When you get a Joe Scalzo book, you get racing from a racer's point of
view.</TE>
<TE>   A former motorcycle racer, Scalzo knows and uses the idioms of the
racing community, giving his words an authenticity rarely found in motor
sports books.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, a crash by A.J. Foyt sent him not to the hospital, but
to "the crashhouse," a cemetery was "a marble orchard," and dirt-track
racing was "a uniquely American invention, like jazz--and, just like
jazz, complete with wild tempo changes and mad improvisations and madder
characters."</TE>
<TE>   The years 1951-71 made up what the Sierra Madre author calls "the
banner binge of dirt track racing," with races at such favorite tracks as
Langhorne Speedway in rural Pennsylvania, and state fairgrounds ovals at
Sacramento, Phoenix, Springfield, Ill., Syracuse, N.Y., and Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Among the drivers featured are Foyt, Jimmy Bryan, Parnelli Jones, Jim
"Herk" Hurtubise, Don Branson, Bobby Hogle, Ernie Triplett and Rex Mays,
many of whom cut their racing teeth on Southern California dirt.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every page has stirring photos of those warriors and their
cars, mostly photographed by Bob Tronolone.</TE>
<TE>   Either the prose or the pictures alone would make "The American Dirt
Track Racer" an ideal book for a racing enthusiast.</TE>

<HD>Those Biting Punch Lines Could Become Real Pain</HD>

<LD>This whole business of pushing Shaq too far, or as our Tim Brown
wrote the other day: "Shaquille O'Neal retaliated, finally, with a
ferocious overhand right that grazed the left ear of Chicago Bull center
Brad Miller," has hit a little close to home.</LD>
<LD>   When I think about F.P. Santangelo, Sports Editor Bill Dwyre, Mike
Garrett, Dodger Boy, the Sparks, USC President Steven Sample, the grocery
store bagger, Kevin Brown a.k.a. Mr. Grumpy, the wife, Tom Goodwin,
anyone who lives in Nebraska or Philadelphia, the Movie Guy, hockey fans,
Phil &amp; Jeanie, Eric Karros, the Lame Ducks, Dan Evans and especially
Raider fans, I better give some thought to delivering one punch line too
many and the ramifications of retaliation.</LD>
<LD>   OK, so if Goodwin took a swing--he'd miss.</LD>
<TE>   And while they tell me Dwyre might crack some day--as if anyone is
going to tell the difference--and he is the boss around here on the days
when he's not playing golf, I just make sure I'm never in the office on
those three Mondays a month.</TE>
<TE>   To be honest, though, I never thought I was doing anything that might
merit retaliation because I've been married for 29 years and all I've
gotten from my wife when I pick on her in the paper is encouragement:
"Keep pushing, mister, and you're going to get it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UNTIL RECENTLY, I thought it was part of Shaq's job as a professional
to accept what he dishes out, but now I read in the newspaper everyone
knew the day was coming when Shaq would explode because there's only so
much a 7-foot-1, 340-pound giant can take.</TE>
<TE>   We're being told his tantrum was really predictable, or as Times
columnist J.A. Adande wrote the other day, "It finally happened," that
word finally again cropping up as way of explaining Shaq's criminal
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox was saying on TV he's surprised this doesn't happen every
night--Shaq, I guess, looking to clobber some foe with his back turned to
him because he has been hit by one more elbow than he has delivered.</TE>
<TE>   You saw what happened Sunday at Pauley Pavilion, players from both
women's basketball teams getting into a fight and USC Coach Chris
Gobrecht and UCLA Coach Kathy Olivier screaming at each other like two
professional wrestlers. Everyone wants to be like Shaq now, and while
that might make for more entertaining women's basketball, I'm still not
going to go (as if I'm really worried about Gobrecht or Olivier
retaliating).</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson, grinning because he knows a Shaq-less team will put him
in a hot tub with Jeanie when the All-Star game is played, was trying to
make the case Monday his center pulled his punches. I'm sure that would
be more comforting to everyone than the picture we saw on TV of a
Butterbean wannabe.</TE>
<TE>   We've also heard from Kobe Bryant defending Shaq and urging him not to
take any more grief. I'm surprised he didn't think of this last season
when they were feuding, because with Shaq serving a suspension, Kobe got
the chance again to go one-on-five and score all the points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I THOUGHT with the benefit of more than 24 hours of reflection--after
almost sending someone to the hospital--Shaq might back off, but our Tim
Brown surmised in the paper: "It appears now the Laker center has put an
entire league on notice; he no longer will take cheap shots, he will
defend himself and he will hurt back."</TE>
<TE>   I was kind of hoping Brown might report Shaq has decided to make his
free throws, but if Brown's interpretation is correct, instead of waiting
for his career to end to become a police officer, Shaq has decided to
begin working now as a vigilante.</TE>
<TE>   Personally speaking, we can't have people just taking it into their
own hands and trying to put a stop to cheap shots or gratuitous rips at
USC.</TE>
<TE>   I think I can be of some help here, though. I have no doubt
Evans-Garrett-Lame Ducks &amp; Co. are on the verge of losing it, but I think
there's a better remedy than someone jeopardizing his personal freedom
with some kind of Shaq-like response. I think I can even provide group
therapy for this cast of misfits.</TE>
<TE>   I would refer the whole lot to Redskin owner Dan Snyder, who simply
paid Marty Schottenheimer $7.5 million to disappear. I would imagine if
Michael Eisner, Eli Broad, Michael Ovitz and Bum Garner were reminded how
they've been skewered in this space and how they will be again--there'd
be no problem raising the kind of money to make the Page 2 columnist
disappear without another punch line ever being delivered.</TE>
<TE>   Not a penny less, though--I've got the bagger to support the rest of
my life.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IF YOU go to dodgers.mlb.com and attempt to print out the team's 2002
schedule, it abruptly stops after an April 25 game at Pittsburgh
suggesting a) something is wrong with the printer or b) the Dodgers
already know when their season will be over.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LET'S SEE Steve Spurrier run up the score with Tony Banks at
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   If Spurrier is going to get $5 million a year and he's never been to a
Super Bowl without buying a ticket, what's Tampa going to pay Bill
Parcells?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE FIRST time Laker Mitch Richmond lifts a finger all season and the
NBA fines him $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Anthony:</TE>
<TE>   "I hope the decision makers at The Times see the error of their ways
and make you change your style of commentary."</TE>
<TE>   I can't imagine any of my bosses ever making a mistake.</TE>

<LD>Trent Dilfer, last year's Super Bowl quarterback with the Baltimore
Ravens, is generally regarded as a journeyman even though he has been a
winner with Tampa Bay, Baltimore and Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Dilfer has no illusions as to his athletic ability, however, saying,
"If I was playing fantasy football, I would not be the first pick and I
would not be my own first pick.</LD>
<LD>   "But if you're talking about trying to win football games, to win a
championship and build the team the right way ... and thriving on
adversity and not caving in under pressure, then I might be my first
pick."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NFL playoff record for rushing touchdowns?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shame on them: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle:
"Showergate, where 44 Eagles' cheerleaders are suing NFL visiting teams
for peeping into the ladies' locker room, is ugly stuff.</TE>
<TE>   "But on the bright side, this puts to rest the tired old whine of pro
athletes, that there's nothing to do after a game in Philly."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In demand: Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post, commenting on the
Redskins hiring Steve Spurrier: "You're not just hot, you're on fire....
When you walked away from Florida and said you wanted to take a shot at
the NFL, that was like Stephen King saying he wanted to write another
book-and would anybody out there like to publish it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Spurrier: Jimmy Johnson commenting to Tim Cowlishaw of the Dallas
Morning News on Spurrier becoming a pro coach before he was hired as
coach of the Redskins: "He's good. He's really good. But the two things
he's going to need are a good general manager and a good defensive
coordinator because he's not interested in either of those two things."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Honest opinion: Barbara Barker of Newsday on New Jersey Net General
Manager Rod Thorn: "Thorn has been a victim of management politics
before. A year after making [Michael] Jordan the best No. 3 pick in the
history of the draft, Thorn was fired from the Bulls when Jerry Reinsdorf
and his partners purchased the team. Because of that, he never got to be
a part of Jordan's six championships.</TE>
<TE>   "Thorn is honest enough to admit that back in 1984, he would have
drafted Hakeem Olajuwon over Jordan if Olajuwon had still been available.</TE>
<TE>   "'I knew he was a good player,' Thorn said of Jordan, 'but I didn't
think he was going to turn out to be arguably the best player in the
history of the league."'</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Uh, plastic beer bottles? Six fans of London's Millwall soccer club
were banned from the stadium for life for acts of hooliganism.</TE>
<TE>   One of them threw a meat pie at a linesman.</TE>
<TE>   Said Millwood chairman Theo Paphitis: "If you allow a meat pie today,
who knows what they'll be throwing tomorrow?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1967, the Green Bay Packers defeated the
Kansas City Chiefs,35-10, in the first Super Bowl game in front of 61,946
at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Emmitt Smith of the Dallas Cowboys, 19 in 17 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Syndicated columnist Norman Chad: "As soon as college
coaching positions opened up, the media began rounding up the usual
suspects. Mike Shanahan's name has appeared on more short lists than a
'loaf of bread."'</TE>

<LD>School reorganization--An article in Saturday's California section
about reorganization at some Los Angeles schools incompletely described
faculty member Cheryl Smith's reaction to changes at Roosevelt High.
Although she expressed no opinion about the departure of the school's
principal, the English teacher said she supports state-recommended
changes to improve students' literacy. "I'm extremely happy that the
state is finally focusing on the same thing I was focused on for 18
years," she said.</LD>
