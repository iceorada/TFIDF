<LD>LINCOLN'S VIRTUES: An Ethical Biography, by William Lee Miller.
Alfred A. Knopf: 522 pp., $30.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Slavery is an ancient institution that has existed in just about
every known society. For millenniums, slavery needed no defenders
because it had no critics. The West is the only civilization that
developed a principled campaign to end slavery. This campaign was
supremely difficult in the United States because slavery was the
cornerstone of the Southern way of life, and educated opinion in the
South convinced itself that slavery was not a necessary evil but a
"positive good."</LD>
<TE>   In this grave situation, the notion that slavery could be ended
and the nation kept together seemed utterly fanciful. Such a mission
required a "philosophical statesman" of the kind that democratic
societies rarely produce. He had to have deep intelligence, not of
the epideictic sort but something closer to wisdom. The times
demanded a man of moral imagination who understood that slavery was
not simply a political but also an ethical issue: It involved the
basic distinction between right and wrong. At the same time, a pure
philosopher or saint was not suited for the task, because neither has
the inclination nor aptitude for public leadership and democratic
politics. Urgently required was a thinker and a moralist who also
knew how to lead and when to act, in order that his great principles
might be realized.</TE>
<TE>   In Illinois, there was such a man.</TE>
<TE>   William Lee Miller's "Lincoln's Virtues" is distinguished by its
claim to be an "ethical biography." At one level, this is a quixotic
enterprise. After several attempts to plumb the sources of Lincoln's
moral development, Miller announces his "discovery" that "Lincoln was
human, he was not born on Mount Rushmore ... he acquired such moral
distinction as he did by deliberate effort over time, and [his] moral
excellence never was or would be anything like perfection." Well, I
could have figured that out without reading the book.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's "ethical biography" does have one great value, however.
It shows how Lincoln translated his moral principles into policy in
the confused and disputatious theater of democratic politics. The
author of "Arguing About Slavery," Miller begins with what may be
termed the "Lincoln myth." How odd it is, he writes, that an
"unschooled" politician "from the raw frontier villages of Illinois
and Indiana" could become America's greatest president and one of the
most admired and loved figures of mankind. "He was the myth made
real," Miller writes, "rising from an actual Kentucky cabin made of
actual Kentucky logs all the way to the actual White House."</TE>
<TE>   Although Miller fully embraces the Lincoln myth, he shows that the
author of this myth is Lincoln himself. Asked to describe his early
life, Lincoln answered with reference to Thomas Gray's poem, "Elegy
Written in a Country Churchyard": "the short and simple annals of the
poor." Lincoln disclaimed great aspirations for himself, noting that
if people did not vote for him, he would return to obscurity, being
used to disappointments. These pieties are inconsistent with what
Lincoln's law partner, William Herndon, said about him: "His ambition
was a little engine that knew no rest." Miller recognizes that even
great ambition, of the kind that Lincoln harbored, is natural to a
politician and favorable to democracy as long as it seeks personal
distinction by promoting the public good through constitutional
means.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Miller is aware that there are influential bodies of
scholarship that criticize and even denounce Lincoln. What these
critiques share is that they deny that Lincoln respected the law and
that he was concerned with the welfare of all. The Southern school,
epitomized by the late Mel Bradford, holds that Lincoln was a
self-serving tyrant who never cared much about slavery but destroyed
half the country to serve his Caesarean ambitions. In the view of
these neo-Confederates, the Civil War was driven primarily by
economic motives: It was the "war of northern aggression." In
California, we may view these claims as crass attempts to justify the
unjustifiable, but many Southerners do not. Surprisingly, Miller, who
teaches at the University of Virginia, pays virtually no attention to
the Southern school.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's main concern is with what may be termed the "liberal
school." This group, composed of left-wing scholars, African American
activists and civil libertarians, is harshly critical of Lincoln on
the grounds that he was a racist who didn't really care about ending
slavery. The indictment against Lincoln is a familiar one: He didn't
oppose slavery outright, only the extension of slavery into the
territories; he said that if he could save the Union without freeing
a single slave, he would do it; he opposed laws permitting
intermarriage and even social and political equality between the
races. Miller is very anxious to dispel these anxieties so that
liberals can reclaim Lincoln as one of their heroes.</TE>
<TE>   To his credit, Miller does not attempt to excuse Lincoln's
opinions and actions by proclaiming him a "man of his time." After
all, there were several persons of that time, notably the Grimke
sisters and Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, who forthrightly and
unambiguously attacked slavery and embraced abolition. Miller cites
Sumner saying that there are issues on which political men can and
should compromise but that slavery is not such an issue: "This will
not admit of compromise. To be wrong on this is to be wholly wrong.
It is ... our duty to ... defend freedom, unreservedly, and careless
of the consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Careless of the consequences. Here we have that recognizable
thing, the voice of Lincoln's contemporary liberal critics, who
(whether they know it or not) are the philosophical descendants of
Sumner. One cannot understand Lincoln without understanding why he
agreed with Sumner's goals while consistently opposing the strategy
of the abolitionists. The abolitionists, Lincoln saw, were not
primarily concerned with restricting or ending slavery. They were
most concerned with self-righteous moral display. They wanted to be
in the right and--as Sumner declares--forget the consequences. In
Lincoln's view, abolition was a noble sentiment, but abolitionist
tactics, such as burning the Constitution and advocating violence,
actually advanced the cause of slavery.</TE>
<TE>   It is the burden of Miller's biography to show why Lincoln's
understanding of slavery and his strategy for defeating it were
superior to Sumner's and his modern-day followers. In this, Miller is
partly successful, mounting, as he himself admits, a "quasi-defense"
of Lincoln. Miller vindicates Lincoln of the charge that he didn't
really care about slavery. For Lincoln, slavery was the very
touchstone of political morality: "If slavery is not wrong, nothing
is wrong." Lincoln authored some of the most telling and memorable
lines against slavery, for example: "Although volume upon volume is
written to prove slavery a very good thing, we never hear of the man
who wishes to take the good of it by being a slave himself!"</TE>
<TE>   Miller effectively shows that the statesman, unlike the moralist,
cannot be content with making the argument: He must find a way to
implement his principles to the degree that circumstances permit.
This is the key to understanding Lincoln. He always found the common
denominator between what was good to do and what the people would go
along with. In a democratic society, this is not just a matter of
prudence. It is the only legitimate way of advancing a moral agenda.</TE>
<TE>   What Miller does not fully appreciate is the consummate skill with
which Lincoln deflected the prejudices of his supporters without
yielding to them. During his debates with Stephen Douglas in the race
for the Illinois Senate, Douglas repeatedly accused Lincoln of
believing that blacks and whites were intellectually equal, of
endorsing full political rights for blacks and of supporting
"amalgamation" or intermarriage between the races. If these charges
could be sustained, if widespread numbers of people believed them to
be true, then Lincoln's career was over. Even in the free state of
Illinois--as throughout the anti-slavery North--there was widespread
opposition to full political and social equality for the races.</TE>
<TE>   So how did Lincoln handle this difficult situation? He used a
series of artfully conditional responses. "Certainly the Negro is not
our equal in color--perhaps not in many other respects; still, in the
right to put into his mouth the bread that his own hands have earned,
he is the equal of every other man. In pointing out that more has
been given to you, you cannot be justified in taking away the little
which has been given him. If God gave him but little, that little let
him enjoy." Notice how little Lincoln concedes to prevailing
prejudice. Lincoln never acknowledges black inferiority; he merely
concedes the possibility. And the thrust of his argument is that even
if blacks are inferior, this is no justification for taking away
their rights.</TE>
<TE>   Or again, facing the charge of racial amalgamation, Lincoln says,
"I protest against this counterfeit logic which concludes that
because I do not want a black woman for a slave, I must necessarily
want her for a wife." Lincoln is not saying that he wants, or does
not want, a black woman for his wife. He is neither supporting nor
opposing racial intermarriage. He is simply saying that from his
anti-slavery position, it does not follow that he endorses racial
amalgamation. Elsewhere Lincoln turned anti-black prejudices against
Douglas by saying that slavery was the institution that had produced
the greatest racial intermixing and the largest number of people of
mixed race offspring.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's book is a defense of Lincoln, but it is not a
full-throated defense, and it falls short of the serious treatment
that a man of Lincoln's depth and greatness demands. Despite its
flaws, "Lincoln's Virtues" is a useful addition to the library of
Lincoln books because it tackles a familiar subject from an unusual
angle, giving appropriate centrality to Lincoln's moral convictions.</TE>

<LD>THE SWEETEST DREAM: A Novel, by Doris Lessing. HarperCollins: 480
pp., $26.95.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "The Sweetest Dream," Doris Lessing's 50th book and 24th novel,
spans two continents and three decades, revisiting places and
passions that have nourished the great writer's greatest works of
realism: London, Africa, communism, war, feminism, race, love,
literature, truth. Readers who have followed Lessing to other planets
and zones will tingle with memory and expectation as they pick up
"The Sweetest Dream."  And surely there are riches in this volume.
Lessing renders the spirit of an age as few writers can, and she
demonstrates the '60s zeitgeist convincingly through tender
friendship between boys and girls, growing intimacy between women, a
melting of reticence, easy conviviality and, of course, drugs.</LD>
<TE>   But overall, the novel disappoints. The sharp reflection
distinguishing the best of Lessing--from her early "The Grass Is
Singing" and "In Pursuit of the English" through "The Golden
Notebook" and "The Children of Violence" series and most recently in
volumes 1 and 2 of her autobiography--is largely gone, leaving us
lost in unfocused scene and story, which Lessing periodically tries
to whip into shape with anger and mockery.</TE>
<TE>   The first two-thirds of "The Sweetest Dream" take place during the
'60s and '70s in a London house in which three generations of
women--all psychically wounded from war and revolutionary politics
and politicos--struggle to survive and ensure the survival of the
next generation. The women are connected through Comrade Johnny, as
narrator and characters mockingly call the novel's chief scoundrel, a
Communist Party hotshot. Julia Lennox, the owner of the big old
house, is Comrade Johnny's mother, a genteel German-born matriarch.
Frances is his ex-wife, whom he's abandoned in his ongoing search for
a woman who's a true comrade. Sylvia is Johnny's stepdaughter, whose
own mother has been driven mad by not one but two communist husbands,
and whom Johnny dumps on Julia and Frances as he moves on in his
never-ending quest for a comrade-mate.</TE>
<TE>   As Comrade Johnny marches in again and again with all-knowing
nods, revolutionary salutes, denunciations ("bourgeois scum") and
expectations of a free meal for himself and whatever comrades he has
in tow, Frances oversees the lives of their sons and the lives of a
changing and growing cast of 1960s waifs whose homes compel them to
seek safe haven with "earth-mother" Frances. So generous is Frances
that she houses not only damaged kids but even her replacement,
Johnny's psychotic wife, as well as another lunatic, the wife of
Frances' lover. Here we have the novel's scheme. Comrade Johnny and
his Party pitted against Frances' party: an ongoing gathering around
the kitchen table, saving the people against saving people.</TE>
<TE>   The sides are clearly drawn, but too little else is. Years blend
into years, insignificant events pile up and significant events get
lost in a kind of vaporous hippie soap opera. Frances falls in love,
and we hardly notice. Her goodness and righteousness feel generic and
repetitious. Comrade Johnny grabs our attention at first: His
exploitation of family contrasts amusingly and zestfully with his
plans for an exploitation-free world, but his dogmatic repertoire
grows predictable, and he quickly becomes a cartoon. Minor characters
in the London section are often indistinguishable, and one has to
work hard to follow what's happening, and to whom. If Lessing is
trying for a dreamy, druggy '60s effect, she doesn't pull it off.</TE>
<TE>   What cuts through the foggy London section is hatred. Frances and
Julia grow closer and closer over the years, bonded in their loathing
for Comrade Johnny. Once Lessing and her deputized characters
dispense with Johnny and his "stupid" dream, Frances and Julia move
on to denounce other "world-changing" delusions and "isms." Favorite
targets include anti-nuclear activists who think like children and
feminists who loathe their own sons and whose ideology bans love and
happiness with men, whom they pounce upon like "cats on sparrows."
But the tirades tire.</TE>
<TE>   The last third of the novel takes place in the '80s in the African
nation of Zimlia, a fictionalized Zimbabwe, and is more successful.
Sylvia, with Frances' and Julia's help, has survived a rejecting
communist father and stepfather, a mad mother, anorexia and mental
illness to become a missionary doctor in Zimlia. Here, hatred of
ideologues and ideology still reigns, but Lessing critiques through
rich description and drama.</TE>
<TE>   Schools and hospitals that the Zimlian revolutionaries have
promised rarely exist, and when they do, the schools often have no
books or teachers and the hospitals no roofs. While Sylvia becomes
both teacher and doctor, the rest of Frances' '60s strays show up in
Africa, and they, along with Johnny's African "comrades," unravel the
last shreds of the dream of social justice. There's no changing the
world, Lessing's story suggests: All the sweet dreams, from whatever
decade, turn into nightmares.</TE>
<TE>   All around Zimlia, poor people are dying of AIDS, taking children
with them or leaving them behind. It is only in the actions of a few
that we can take any hope. Many minor characters in the African
section win our hearts: old people, sick people and unsung heroines
conspiring on their behalf. Lessing's good guys and bad guys alike
have memorable presence, pulling us into the novel's moral drama,
though one wishes the cast of villains in her African panorama
included players of the colonial past and the globalizing present and
not just those on Lessing's ideological hit list.</TE>
<TE>   Twentieth century radical politics is a mad affair, with the best
and the worst of our kind emerging. Lessing put in her time in the
political trenches, and she has the battle scars to show for it: a
post-Stalinist post-traumatic stress syndrome that makes her tremble
and shout at the first sight of most any ideology. Even in her most
politically aligned period, when she was still sympathetic to
communism, Lessing never endorsed using the novel for political
expression, criticizing novels that were "tracts about progress ...
the dreadful lifeless products of socialist realism."</TE>
<TE>   "The Sweetest Dream," though, reads often like anti-socialist
realism, a politically driven tract declaring progress a false dream
that is thick, ironically enough, with the kind of fixed opinions and
oversimplifications that, to Lessing's mind, wreck both social and
literary promise.</TE>

<LD>SCIENCE FICTIONS: A Scientific Mystery,  Massive Cover-Up, and the
Dark Legacy of Robert Gallo, by John Crewdson. Little, Brown: 672
pp., $27.95.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   In the history of science, as in other fields, there have
certainly been scandals and controversial figures: researchers who
planted archeological finds made from clay, fudged their statistics
or painted spots on lab animals to prove something about genetics
that wasn't true. But what if they falsify research on diseases when
lives are hanging in the balance?</LD>
<TE>   That's an offense of another order, especially when it concerns a
disease as cruel as AIDS, according to John Crewdson's "Science
Fictions." HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, has spread worldwide to
50 million people  and killed 20 million so far, most of them young
adults and children. The scale of the global AIDS epidemic was
becoming clearly known in the 1980s and early 1990s when the events
in Crewdson's book were unfolding. The story of the U.S. National
Cancer Institute's Robert Gallo and his relentless insistence that he
was the first to discover HIV and the first to develop a blood test
for it--in the face of powerful evidence to the contrary--is
gruesome, indeed harrowing, for suggesting what happens when
scientists succumb to ego and greed in the race for discovery.</TE>
<TE>   Few in the scientific community can forget Gallo's April 1984
announcement that his lab had discovered that AIDS was caused by a
retrovirus called HTLV-III. The discovery led to the development of a
blood test to protect the blood supply and help doctors make
diagnoses and begin work on vaccines. This was a triumphant moment
for American scientific research, by far the best-funded and most
active in the world.</TE>
<TE>   But across the Atlantic, this book relates, all was not well.
Months before Gallo's announcement, a group of French scientists at
the Pasteur Institute in Paris had sent a sample of their own
candidate AIDS virus, which they called LAV, to Gallo's lab.
Eventually the French began to suspect that Gallo's lab workers had
contaminated their cell cultures with LAV and had then rediscovered
it and claimed it as their own. Perhaps, at first, Gallo and his
colleagues deceived themselves into believing that they had
discovered this virus independently of the French. But AIDS viruses
from different people are different in subtle but detectable ways,
and by 1991, it became clear that the French were right: LAV and
HTLV-III were the same virus and had come from the same patient. The
credit for the discovery should have gone to the French.</TE>
<TE>   Crewdson describes how Gallo maintained that, though his
technicians might have used the French virus by mistake, his own lab
was the first to grow the virus in significant quantities and to
develop a blood test that showed that this new virus was the most
likely cause of AIDS. The French might have isolated the virus first,
he suggested, but the Americans made it useful: It was an argument
akin to saying that the Germans had demonstrated that nuclear fission
was theoretically possible but that Americans made the first bombs
and reactors, or that English mathematician Alan Turing may have
described the principle of a computer but that a real operating
system was developed by Americans.</TE>
<TE>   That is how the credit for the AIDS blood test was apportioned in
1994, when the head of the NIH announced that royalties for the test
would be split 50-50 between the French and the Americans. But in
"Science Fictions," we learn that, for Crewdson, the matter didn't
end there. He has spent the last eight years sifting the evidence and
has come up with some startling conclusions: Gallo wasn't the first
to grow the virus in significant quantities nor was he the first to
make a blood test that showed the virus was the most likely cause of
AIDS. In fact, Gallo's blood test, although based on the French
virus, wasn't nearly as good as another test developed by the French.
Even though the French had applied for a patent more than a year
before Gallo did, Gallo's test was patented first and was the first
one on the U.S. market, where it was used to screen the blood supply.</TE>
<TE>   Though the American test could identify most infected batches of
blood, it also had a high false-positive rate that meant many safe
batches of blood were thrown away at great cost to the blood banks.
When Abbott Laboratories, the company that made the test, tried to
improve it, the result was a test that failed to detect all infected
bags of blood, and some slipped through the screening process with
tragic results. Meanwhile, the U.S. government, which held Gallo's
patent, was raking in millions of dollars a year, and Gallo and
Mikulas Popovic, his postdoctoral assistant, were taking home
handsome royalties. The French sued, but U.S. government patent
lawyers kept them tied up in technicalities for years, costing both
parties an enormous amount of money.</TE>
<TE>   Crewdson's squalid tale of grasping self-interest in the face of a
devastating epidemic is told through court documents, reports from
internal NIH and congressional investigative committees and
interviews. The enormous amount of evidence which the author has
gathered in favor of the French seems convincing. A Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist, Crewdson reveals how Gallo was able to
suppress the results of others, including the French scientists,
through his influence over scientific journals and meetings. Then,
the U.S. government tried too hard to defend him and disparage the
French.</TE>
<TE>   By Crewdson's account, Gallo may well be a rascal, but still, 10
years seems a long time to devote oneself to one wayward scientist.
(Today, Gallo heads the Institute of Human Virology in Maryland, an
independent research facility that receives money from public and
private sources.) It is chilling to contemplate that, according to
the book, some people may have died because the more accurate French
test was kept off the market. The French test eventually entered the
market, and U.S. manufacturers managed to improve their own test, and
by now many lives have been saved by AIDS blood tests. The discovery
of the cause of AIDS will leave a mark on the world forever and
matters far more than the men and women who made it.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't say so, but investigating the unholy alliance between
scientists, government and industry in America was clearly part of
Crewdson's motivation. But not all scientists behave as Gallo does in
Crewdson's account, and focusing so much attention on this case risks
overly demonizing the scientific establishment in general, which some
journalists see as a secretive coven of amoral, even destructive
geniuses.</TE>
<TE>   However, "Science Fictions" dramatizes far more important issues
in contemporary science that others have recently been raising, but
which Crewdson himself does not explore. Despite the billions of
dollars spent on medical research every year in the United States,
the returns have been relatively poor lately, and "Science Fictions"
does shed considerable light on the way science works in America and
the larger dilemma it may be facing.</TE>
<TE>   Medical historian James Le Fanu has argued that the golden age of
medical research began in the 1930s with the discovery of antibiotics
and ended roughly in the 1970s with the invention of in-vitro
fertilization. The intervening years saw the development of
treatments for mental illnesses and childhood cancer, new surgical
techniques and many other innovations. Since then, the rate of
innovation has slowed while government and industry science budgets
have soared. The number of new chemical entities filed by the U.S.
patent office is about half what it was 40 years ago, and many
patents today are merely for "copycat" versions of existing drugs. Le
Fanu blames molecular biology, which he sees as a technical
distraction from the serious business of studying disease.</TE>
<TE>   But there are other possible explanations for the relatively slow
pace of medical innovation today. Like so many other things in this
world, science has become bureaucratized. The people closest to the
work itself often aren't the ones making the decisions. "Science
Fictions" describes how Popovic originally wanted to give the French
credit for their findings and their help. But Gallo, according to
Crewdson, had problems with Popovic's scientific paper and took out
almost all the references to the French virus. Postdocs like Popovic
do most of the research in the world's labs, but they are in a very
precarious position.</TE>
<TE>   According to science journalist Daniel Greenberg, in the early
1980s, leading U.S. scientists warned the government that by 1990,
there would be a shortage of scientists in the country, and this
could threaten America's position in the world. They reminded U.S.
politicians that the Soviets had a vigorous scientific research
program, devoted mainly to military applications. So the U.S.
government provided universities with money to expand their science
doctoral programs. In the end, established scientists got more cheap
labor, but the scientist shortage never materialized. Now, most new
PhDs move on to low-paying postdoctoral positions in other people's
labs. If, after a few years, they fail to make a major discovery (and
many do fail), they move on to other postdoc jobs. This may well have
been running through Popovic's mind when, according to "Science
Fictions," his powerful boss urged him not to give the French any
credit. In the end, when the various government committees
investigated the AIDS virus incident, Popovic, not Gallo, took most
of the blame.</TE>
<TE>   These days, the atmosphere in America's labs is increasingly tense
and competitive, sometimes in an unhealthy, unproductive way. The
glut of underemployed postdocs explains part of this phenomenon. So
does the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, which allowed scientists at federally
funded labs to profit, personally, from patented discoveries. As
predicted, this led to closer ties between industry and academic
research. But no one predicted that it would deal such a blow to the
spirit of cooperation among scientists.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `Science Fictions'</TE>
<TE>   Popovic flew to Utah on March 18, 1984, a Sunday. The following
Friday, he got a message to call Gallo at once. When Popovic found a
phone, he learned that Gallo had major problems with his manuscript,
especially Popovic's description of his experiments with LAV....</TE>
<TE>   The manuscript Popovic saw when he walked into the lab on Monday
afternoon bore little resemblance to the one he had left behind.
Entire sentences, even whole paragraphs, had been excised, replaced
with Gallo's scrawled additions. Crossed out altogether was the
paragraph in which Popovic acknowledged the Pasteur's discovery of
LAV and explained that the French virus was "described here" as
HTLV-3.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't believe it," Gallo had written in the margin. "You
are absolutely incredible." Also gone was Popovic's description of
his use of LAV as a "reference virus" in his search for a permissive
T-cell line. Next to that strikeout, Gallo had scribbled "Mika you
are crazy."</TE>

<LD>* THE LAST CANYON: A Novel, By John Vernon, Houghton Mifflin: 352
pp., $24</LD>
<LD>   * STAGECOACH: Wells Fargo and the American West, By Philip L.
Fradkin, Simon &amp; Schuster: 250 pp., $27.50</LD>
<LD>   When John Wesley Powell set out to run the Colorado River in 1869,
he embarked upon the last great journey of exploration on the North
American continent. The telegraph and the transcontinental railroad
had already reached the Western frontier, and "Manifest Destiny" was
a practical reality. Still, one place on the continent remained a
mystery: No white man had rafted the Colorado through the Grand
Canyon, and the one-armed Civil War hero was determined to be the
first one to do so.</LD>
<TE>   "[T]he height of the walls causes birds to exhaust themselves
before they can fly out, with the result that they drop back
senseless into the canyon," went one of the tall tales that cautioned
Powell and his men on the eve of their adventure, or so we are told
in John Vernon's richly imagined historical novel, "The Last Canyon."
"I told the men such stories are ant paste," writes Powell to his
wife, "and they agreed to come along with my solemn assurances--but
who really knows?" The question of exactly what happened on the
Powell expedition has spawned a literature of its own, starting with
Powell's own account and continuing for more than a century. Wallace
Stegner's "Beyond the Hundredth Meridian" in 1954 was the first of
the modern biographies of Powell, and the most recent one, Donald
Worster's "A River Running West" was published only last year. Thus
Jack Sumner, a member of the Powell party, was prescient when he
titled his 1909 memoir "Colorado River Controversies."</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the controversies--and of Vernon's novel--are the
quality of Powell's leadership and the scale of his heroism. Indeed,
Vernon suggests that some of Powell's men regarded him as not much of
a leader or no hero at all. "Sometimes," grouses one of the
characters in "The Last Canyon," "I think a chained lion would scare
him." Another one rehearses what he will say to the overly cautious
expedition leader: "Stop this dilly-dallying and stir your stumps
pronto, you one-armed bag of pus."</TE>
<TE>   Several of the men on the expedition were so despairing that they
simply abandoned the man they dismissively called "Professor,"
climbed out of the canyon and headed into the wilderness in the hope
of reaching a remote Mormon settlement. Here is the ultimate puzzle
of the Powell expedition: We know that the mutineers were found
slaughtered on the canyon rim, but we do not know the particulars of
their deaths. Vernon, who is both a novelist ("La Salle") and a
memoirist ("A Book of Reasons"), resorts to historical fiction to
explain why and how they came to such a gruesome end.</TE>
<TE>   Vernon also uses his novel to make a point that is often
underplayed or overlooked altogether in history and biography: Powell
may have regarded the Colorado River as "the Great Unknown," but it
was well known to the native dwellers of the Southwest. Pausing now
and then in his account of the Powell expedition, Vernon makes the
point by telling the compelling tale of a family of Paiutes on a
search for a missing daughter. To the Paiutes, the Colorado River is
the Pawhaw, and the side canyons of the Grand Canyon were familiar
places where they cultivated corn, squash and melons--"a world inside
the world," as Vernon puts it.</TE>
<TE>   The climax of "The Last Canyon" is an intriguing intersection of
the two tales--Vernon imagines an encounter between the men whose
exploits are a fact of history and the Paiute band whose exploits are
purely imaginary. "They threaten us with guns. They go off into the
bushes with our women. They take our rocks," complains one of the
Paiutes. "What will they take next? The trees? The river?"</TE>
<TE>   "They can't take a river," retorts his companion.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh no? They're pretty crafty."</TE>
<TE>   Thus does Vernon inject the saga of the Powell expedition with an
even stronger dose of irony, tension and tragedy than history itself
provides, and thus does "The Last Canyon" leave us with both a
plausible explanation of an old mystery and an augury of what will
follow in the wake of Powell's famous riverboats.</TE>
<TE>   The deeply familiar image of a stagecoach and a team of six horses
clattering over a raw landscape is both a shimmering icon of Western
myth and legend and the carefully tended trademark of a bank. For
precisely that reason, "Stagecoach" by Philip L. Fradkin can be
approached as both a colorful work of frontier history and a
cool-headed corporate biography.</TE>
<TE>   As early as 1865, for example, Wells Fargo had already won a place
in "the heart and habit" of the Old West, as one frontier newspaper
editor put it, carrying mail and holding deposits of gold and silver
in far-flung settlements and outposts from the Rocky Mountains to the
Pacific Ocean. "It is the Ready Companion of civilization," enthused
the editor who is quoted in "Stagecoach," "the Universal Friend and
Agent of the miner, his errand man, his banker, his post office."</TE>
<TE>   Fradkin appreciates the richness of the lore that has attached
itself to Wells Fargo, but he indulges in no such rhetorical excess.
"Follow Wells Fargo and you follow the path of money," he points out
bluntly. "Wells Fargo was a business dedicated to remaining in
business and making a profit, which was sometimes considerable and a
few times excessive."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Fradkin is a seasoned journalist whose credentials include
a stint as a war correspondent in Vietnam, and his coverage of the
Watts riots helped to earn a Pulitzer Prize for the Los Angeles
Times. One measure of his honesty and sobriety is the fact that he
feels obliged to disclose, at the very outset of his book, that he
and his wife once took out a loan from a bank that was eventually
acquired by Norwest Corp., the conglomerate that now owns Wells
Fargo.</TE>
<TE>   "Stagecoach" focuses on the liveliest era in the company's long
history, from its founding in 1852 until 1918. Henry Wells and
William Fargo were former messenger boys who went on to launch both
American Express and the company that bears their names, and they
were visionaries as well as entrepreneurs: Wells once proposed to
relieve the Post Office of the burden of delivering of the U.S. mail.
"Zounds, sir!" said one alarmed official. "It would throw 16,000
postmasters out of office."</TE>
<TE>   Fradkin surveys the history of Wells Fargo in all its sweep, and
he shows how the company played a crucial role in--and not
incidentally prospered from--such national upheavals as the Gold Rush
and the Civil War. Now and then his eye falls on an endearing detail.
Thus, for example, he literally deconstructs the Concord mail coach
that served as the trademark of Wells Fargo right from the beginning,
and he shows us how these "Rolls-Royces of stagecoaches" were
lovingly put together by hand. "At a time when brands were rare," he
points out, "the Concord coach was as recognizable as the Colt
revolver."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, even the hardheaded Fradkin is charmed by his subject,
and he betrays a certain sense of regret when he reports how the
company moved its corporate headquarters to New York City in 1903.
"The company suffered a loss of its western essence--its mystique, if
you will--with the move back to New York City," he concludes. "Wells
Fargo became just another profitable business."</TE>

<LD>In reviewing my book, "Operation Gatekeeper: The Rise of the 'Illegal
Alien' and the Making of the U.S.-Mexico Boundary" (Book Review, Jan.
13), Sam Quinones does an outstanding job of presenting his own
views. But much of the little he actually writes about my book leaves
me wondering if we are talking about the same work.</LD>
<LD>   Quinones states that my main argument is that "the enforcement of
the border gave rise to the concept of the illegal alien." My actual
argument is something different and far more complex. The book's main
goals are to understand how and why unauthorized immigration and the
perception of a southern boundary "out of control" emerged as issues
of national concern in the 1990s, giving rise to Operation
Gatekeeper, and to evaluate Gatekeeper's effects in addition to what
the operation and the larger border buildup say about the United
States and international boundaries.</LD>
<LD>   He further contends that I "believe that those favoring
enforcement of the border and immigration law are racists." I
explicitly state in a number of places, however, that it is far too
simple to make such an argument. Racist sentiment is and has always
has been a factor but one that certainly does not apply to all
individuals. Other factors are of great significance--nationalism,
for instance.</LD>
<TE>   Quinones' views on border and immigration enforcement differ
significantly from mine. But this should not prevent him from
representing my book accurately.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Nevins</TE>
<TE>   Berkeley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sam Quinones replies:</TE>
<TE>   Again, Joseph Nevins imputes dubious motives (if not racism, then
nationalism) to all those who believe in controlling the borders and
immigration to this country. The issue is too complex for thinking
that facile. Nevins apparently finds no room for someone like me, who
supports and welcomes both immigrants and border control. The United
States cannot thrive without both.</TE>
<TE>   I have lived in Mexico City and have covered immigration from both
sides of the border for eight years. Thus I wanted very much to like
Nevins' book. I am sorry he believes I misstated his thesis. But as I
said in the review, his writing is so thick and convoluted that I
often didn't understand what he was trying to say. This is a shame.
Immigration is one of the great stories of our time. Mexican
immigration and the Tijuana-San Ysidro border: These are issues that
are alive, electric, packed with the drama of common people put to
the test. I think what's written about it ought to reflect this.</TE>

<LD>HOMO ZAPIENS: A Novel, by Victor Pelevin; translated from the Russian
by Andrew Bromfield. Viking: 250 pp., $24.95.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   "Once upon a time in Russia there really was a carefree, youthful
generation that smiled in joy at the summer, the sea and the sun, and
chose Pepsi." So opens Victor Pelevin's latest and best novel, "Homo
Zapiens," the Homeric odyssey of a young poet trying to make his way
through the brave new world of post-glasnost advertising. In the
fairy tale past of the USSR, there was only one truth, and it had
little to do with either Madison Avenue or Britney Spears:
"Generation 'P' had no choice in the matter and children of the
Soviet seventies chose Pepsi in precisely the same way as their
parents chose Brezhnev."</LD>
<TE>   With this appropriately satirical introduction, Babylen Tatarsky
(named, in a fit of Communist Party spirit, after the Hero of the
Revolution) arrives on the scene. Slaving away behind the barricaded
plexiglass of a cigarette kiosk run by Chechens, Tatarsky is rescued
into advertising by a friend who has discovered how many thousands
can be made in this new propaganda.</TE>
<TE>   And indeed, Tatarsky discovers he has the knack, even though his
first client is found strangled with a telephone cord and burned with
an electric iron. Through the influence of a variety of comrades,
Tatarsky slowly brews a view of the world and the power of
advertising from equal parts Dostoevsky, psychedelic mushrooms and
Einstein, the father of the fourth dimension of "airtime/ad space."
"He had this theory of relativity," one of Tatarsky's bosses explains
to him, "maybe you've heard of it. Soviet power did it as well, only
via a paradox--you know that. They lined up the guys in the camps,
gave them shovels and told them to dig a trench from the fence as far
as lunchtime."</TE>
<TE>   And then one day, searching for inspiration, Tatarsky purchases a
Ouija board and a ream of paper and communes with the spirit of Che
Guevara. All the world's a TV, says Guevara. The world is a cheesy
line of "wow" moments in which man, like a rat in a maze armed with a
remote control, zaps his way from channel to channel: Homo zapiens in
search of "wows" until the battery runs down. "It follows,
therefore," writes the spirit of Che, "that the end of the world,
which is the inevitable outcome of the wowerisation of consciousness,
will present absolutely no danger of any kind.... The end of the
world will simply be a television programme. And this, comrades in
the struggle, fills us all with inexpressible bliss."</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, our pilgrim makes progress, conquering Chechen thugs
and anti-Semitic copywriters who draw Hasids on Harleys, until he is
hired by the Institute of Apiculture, where the carpets are sprinkled
with cocaine and the boss celebrates every advertising victory by
pinning a medal on a pet hamster named Rostropovich. It is there that
he discovers the ultimate zapper that controls all Russia, where
advertising is propaganda, the medium--to riff off novelist Mikhail
Bulgakov--is the master and Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   If a Marshall McLuhan-esque message seems a bit banal in the
post-postmodern West, not to worry. Pelevin perches on these moments
for only a second before a stray flake dissolves in his sinus and
bang, Tatarsky is off on another roll.</TE>
<TE>   And if all this seems somewhat hyperkinetic, note that the
39-year-old Pelevin (whose other novels, the wonderful "Life of
Insects" and "Buddha's Little Finger," have been given equally
colloquial but unself-conscious translations by Andrew Bromfield) has
been called the heir to Gogol, Dostoevsky and Bulgakov in his native
land.</TE>
<TE>   But it is more fitting, perhaps, given the worldwide connectedness
of his theme, to make Pelevin a citizen of the country of other
writers sprinkled around the globe who see a similarly quirky pattern
in the carpet. Pelevin's hard-boiled wonderland of a Moscow sits well
next to Haruki Murakami's Tokyo, Julio Cortazar's Paris and Terry
Gilliam's Brazil. All four writers have sci fi-sized imaginations,
literary backgrounds and, most important, fierce grasps of their own
morphing cultures and languages. If Pelevin's Moscow is less sexual
than the other capitals (remarkable, given its reputation), that is
only one more surprise from this writer who continues to be one of
the most energetic and imaginative voices to reach our Western
antennas.</TE>

<LD>LOOKING FOR HISTORY: Dispatches from Latin America, by Alma
Guillermoprieto. Pantheon Books: 308 pp., $25.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   There's a reason why magical realism flourished in Latin America.
The place--or places, rather--can be chimeric, mirage-like,
extraordinarily difficult for the average rational western mind to
wrap itself around. At the same time, this far-flung geography is a
mundane realm ruled by political and economic realities so hard-edged
as to seem obvious, and therein lies another trap.</LD>
<TE>   Most journalists from this country who grapple with Latin America
stumble. They scratch just beneath the stereotypes and are so dazzled
by their discoveries that they think they've found nuance and depth.
Or they remain so befuddled that they turn repeatedly to comparisons
with familiar touchstones in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But to be a Latin American journalist in Latin America isn't easy.
From the Rio Grande to Patagonia, local journalists are harassed,
censored, intimidated, bought or killed. Dinosauric political bosses
from the left and old-style caciques from the right, ruthless drug
traffickers, obsolete laws and corrupt employers can make the life of
a journalist miserable. Yet the predicament of the Latin American
journalist does not end there.</TE>
<TE>   As a general rule, journalists and media organizations in Latin
America lack the basic protections and resources that journalists and
the media in the United States take for granted. In spite of all
these limitations, some of them excel at their craft, yet few will
ever get the international recognition they deserve.</TE>
<TE>   Every once in a while, though, an Alma Guillermoprieto appears on
the American horizon to write sensibly about a wildly diverse region
united by powerful commonalities. A Mexican who writes in Spanish and
English, Guillermoprieto needs no translator, not of the nuanced
Spanish that predominates nor of the even more subtle body language
with which the region's people communicate. Whether she's reporting
from the jungles of Colombia, the streets of Mexico City, the beaches
of Cuba or public libraries in New York or Buenos Aires,
Guillermoprieto captures the human side of her subjects at their
historical moment in lucid prose and with passion and depth. She is a
writer who knows the names of the trees, the plants and the peculiar
characteristics of a kitchen in Puebla, Mexico. Unencumbered by
cultural filters or preconceptions, she never needlessly reaches for
an American analogy to demystify the subject at hand."Looking for
History" is a compilation of 17 essays, focusing on Argentina,
Colombia Cuba, Mexico and Peru, published in the New Yorker or in the
New York Review of Books.</TE>
<TE>   Standing out like a small jewel among the fine pieces is an
unnervingly lucid account of the 1990 presidential campaign of
world-renowned Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa. Latin American
intellectuals have played a very important political role in their
countries since independence from Spain in the early 19th century.
Some, like Domingo Faustino Sarmiento in Argentina and Romulo
Gallegos in Venezuela, have even won the presidency, and their
novels, "Facundo" and "Dona Barbara" respectively served as political
blueprints for their governments. But Vargas Llosa the politician,
writes Guillermoprieto, "failed to see what his novels know."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, as Guillermoprieto sees it, Vargas Llosa stood no chance
of joining the select presidential group. He was too honest about his
feelings for his country and naive enough to put those feelings into
print. "Perhaps saying that I love my country is not true," Vargas
Llosa wrote, "I often loathe it. Although I was born in Peru, my
vocation is that of a cosmopolitan and an expatriate who has always
detested nationalism."</TE>
<TE>   "This," marvels Guillermoprieto, "in the course of explaining how
he happened to decide to run for president. Can such a man triumph in
politics? Should he?"</TE>
<TE>   Smart enough to find the telling quote to portray the man,
Guillermoprieto is also familiar enough with the harsh realities of
the region to expose a flaw. "One hardly knows," she writes, "whether
to wince or laugh at [Vargas Llosa's] description of some of his
rallies." During one political debate, his opponent, the now infamous
Alberto Fujimori, chided: "It seems that you would like to make Peru
a Switzerland, Dr. Vargas."</TE>
<TE>   "Typically for Fujimori," writes Guillermoprieto, "his gibe was a
few degrees off the mark: the point was, Vargas Llosa had campaigned
as if Peru already were Switzerland."</TE>
<TE>   But her real talent in this essay is her ability to reveal the
paradox of Vargas Llosa's political failure. "The ruling classes'
xenophobia, racism and conservative prejudices found expression in
Mario Vargas Llosa's campaign, even as the candidate haplessly
defended his own agnosticism, decried racism and took refuge in his
daily readings of Karl Popper and the Spanish Golden Age poet Luis de
Gongora."</TE>
<TE>   Nor is Guillermoprieto shy about venturing into more familiar
territory, scrutinizing the lives and the eerily parallel ambitions
of Eva Duarte-Peron and Ernesto "Che" Guevara. Her fresh approach is
to explore the ways in which each icon aspired to saintliness. The
piece begins with the writer striking an intimate tone, looking at
early photographs, old film footage and an image of Eva Peron
reproduced in an old promotional piece and not shying from the
obvious. "Eva Duarte's destiny is so strong by now that it is almost
impossible to believe that at the time the picture was taken she did
not know, as we do, that this bland and to all appearances untalented
girl, born illegitimate and on a ranch, was soon to become Evita."
One Guillermoprieto line in particular perfectly synthesizes the
tango-like life of Eva Duarte-Peron. "eforeMi vida por Peron!' she cried
a thousand times before the roaring crowds, and then she died."</TE>
<TE>   In Evita's life, however, there's much more than melodrama.
Guillermoprieto reconstructs the embedded ambiguities that
characterized her subject, who in one paragraph is a powerful,
demagogic, grasping and calculating corrupt politician and in the
next is a devoted feminist pushing for a women's voting rights act.
To understand her following among the poor and the disenfranchised,
consider this insightful paragraph:</TE>
<TE>   "Peron had a horror of physical contact. Evita kissed lepers. She
also took lice-infested urchins to the official residence for a rest
cure and bathed them herself; started a union for domestic workers;
and set up hospitals, children's homes and a home for girls who
traveled to the big city and found themselves penniless, as she once
had."</TE>
<TE>   No wonder the poor in Argentina saw her as a saintly figure.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Guillermoprieto captures perfectly the environment in
which Guevara lived and died, a hemisphere in which the corruption of
leaders cries out as loudly as the injustice of its political,
economic and judiciary systems. "Guevara," she writes, "stood out
against the inflamed horizon of his time, alone and unique." Dead, we
are told, he satisfies the fervor of some people in Latin America.
Alive, "he demanded that others follow his impossible example, and
never understood how to combine what he wanted with what was
achievable."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, though, the journalist's portrait of Guevara is far
from hagiographic. "He was," writes Guillermoprieto, "a fanatic,
consumed by restlessness and a frighteningly abstract hatred, who in
the end recognized only one moral value as supreme: the willingness
to be slaughtered for a cause."</TE>
<TE>   In other pieces in the collection, Guillermoprieto's skills as a
reporter shine; her stories of life in Cuba are particularly strong.
One, for instance, chronicles the visit of John Paul II to the
Caribbean island in January 1998 and the political tug of war between
the pope and Fidel Castro. In another piece, "Love and Misery in
Cuba," she skillfully dissects the ironies that connect and divide
the Miami Cuban community and their friends and family back home. If
it weren't for the money the exiled Cuban community sends to the
island, she points out, their relatives in Cuba would not be able to
survive. But if it weren't for these same generous souls in Miami so
stubborn in pressing the United States to maintain and tighten its
embargo on the island, life would be better for the people and Castro
would run out of excuses to justify the failure of his regime</TE>
<TE>   What makes "Looking for History" valuable is not so much the
timeliness of its stories, which continue to be relevant, or the
scope of the reporting. What separates this book from the common
reporting on Latin America are the author's insight and her
determination to tell the story in its own terms, from a Latin
American perspective.</TE>

<LD>COLORING THE NEWS: How Crusading for Diversity Has Corrupted American
Journalism, by William McGowan. Encounter Books: 278 pp., $25.95.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   There it was: that look, on the face of a member of Harvard's
prestigious Society of Fellows, as I told him over coffee in 1996
that the "epidemic" of racist arson against black churches headlined
on the nation's front pages was a fantasy. Worse, I said, newspapers
weren't admitting they'd been stampeded by activists' claims that a
small uptick in church arsons nationwide was concentrated on black
churches. They hadn't bothered to discover that many of the
black-church fires were set not by racist nightriders but by blacks
seeking insurance money or drunken white teens seeking thrills. My
new acquaintance gave me the easing-toward-the-exit smile of one
who's found himself at the wrong table. Like many busy people, he
relies more than he realizes on editors' news judgments to take his
bearings amid racial, sexual and other social changes. Keeping his
political and moral equilibrium sometimes involves being notified
when to be outraged. It unnerved him to be told he was being misled.</LD>
<TE>   William McGowan, who'll get lots of looks like the one I got,
explains the problem with the arson story and other such reportorial
wrongs. How are journalists, who are professional skeptics, so easily
gulled? His answer is flagged by his subtitle: Something has gone
terribly wrong with the noble goal of diversifying American
newsrooms, where more racial and sexual variety is supposed to
enhance political and philosophical vitality. Too often, McGowan
claims, it has done the opposite, as high-end media managers dress up
quarterly bottom-lining with color- and gender-coded crusading that
asks reporters to become true believers, not skeptics. The result, he
says, is a toxic brew of guilt-driven moral posturing by publishers
and editors, bureaucratic diversity training and groupthink for
reporters, racial and sexual sensationalism and cheerleading and
stroking for targeted markets.</TE>
<TE>   Promoting "diversity" for profit and moral purity reminds me of
Woody Allen's quip that the socialist magazine Dissent was merging
with the conservative magazine Commentary "to form Dissentary." But
journalists who've made it their mission to slay the dragons of
racism, sexism and homophobia may consider McGowan part of a
conservative, white-male media-bashing campaign. There are indeed
such campaigns. McGowan has gotten too close to them for a good
skeptic's comfort, and some of his documentation looks sloppy or
manipulative. But his targets' flaws transcend his own and must be
reckoned with. He carries his argument through journalistic
embarrassments touching feminism, gay rights and immigration as well
as race, but the book's title reflects his preoccupation with the
last, which began for him in Sri Lanka, where he wrote tellingly of
racial and ethnic conflict for his book "Only Man Is Vile."</TE>
<TE>   "Coloring the News" opens with an account of how, in 1995, as
initiatives against affirmative action arose in California and other
states, journalist Nicholas Lemann wrote a New York Times Magazine
profile, widely reprinted and retold, that made a civic saint of
Patrick Chavis. The black physician had been admitted to UC Davis'
medical school under a racial-preference quota the U.S. Supreme Court
later struck down after a challenge by white applicant Allan Bakke.
Still angry about Bakke, Lemann contrasted Chavis' apparently noble
work among the poor of Compton with Bakke's humdrum service in
Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later (as the Los Angeles Times reported fully, though
McGowan doesn't acknowledge it), California's medical board revoked
the medical license of Chavis for "gross negligence" after six
patients were injured and one died from botched operations in a
liposuction business he was running. Chavis was an embarrassment to
affirmative action because Lemann's misplaced moralism had made him
an icon; so, McGowan reports, the New York Times and many other
papers that had touted him never reported his fall. Perhaps, having
abused Chavis by inflating him, Lemann and the New York Times hadn't
the heart to hit him again. But what about their obligation to
readers, like my Harvard acquaintance, who still think Chavis a hero?</TE>
<TE>   Journalists whom McGowan queried agreed that had Bakke been
"caught in such flagrant malpractice, the press would have been all
over the story." But they wouldn't admit this in print, where,
McGowan claims, their credibility is dropping as readers tire of
forced marches through stagy morality plays like the Chavis and
church-arson stories; the "decimation" of the Congressional Black
Caucus by Supreme Court rulings against racially drawn districts; the
"re-segregation" of higher education via Proposition 209 (at the
hands of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, no less).</TE>
<TE>   We need better reporting, especially, McGowan argues, to sort
conflicting claims about racial preferences. He argues that--in
sectors such as college admissions and journalism, where nonwhites
are sought avidly--affirmative action, which was supposed to counter
discrimination, has been superceded by a color-coded "diversity" to
keep up the appearance of full racial integration even when pools of
fully qualified applicants are thin. Instead of helping the
disadvantaged, "diversity's" claim that serious deficiencies are
really just cultural "differences" reflects a fudging of entrance and
performance standards to deflect political or bureaucratic
presumptions of racism and to enhance a company's niche marketing
efforts. Thus contrived, diversity ends up misjudging and isolating
its supposed beneficiaries, like Chavis.</TE>
<TE>   How pervasive is this? McGowan says that news corporations' legal
and marketing priorities are at odds with the public's need to find
out. He notes that some "diversity" programs chill true diversity of
opinion and freedom of expression: Religious and/or anti-abortion
reporters are more closeted now in mainstream newsrooms than gays; so
are blacks who think that O.J. was guilty or that racial preferences
bring dubious returns. Those who leap forward to speak for their
"groups" become apparatchiks of color, he claims, licensed to
dispense bitterness and mistrust in measured doses to all who deviate
from accepted patterns: Several times McGowan cites Washington Post
columnist Dorothy Gilliam, former president of the National Assn. of
Black Journalists, for rants about the "plantation" racism of whites
who doubt, say, Marion Barry's statesmanship, and he cites Latino and
gay counterparts in the piety police. Nervous white editors roll over
at dubious charges of racism: McGowan tells how only after
embarrassing legal depositions did Gannett's Burlington Free Press in
Vermont settle out of court with an award-winning white reporter it
had fired because he'd angered a black politician by telling the
truth about a public meeting "for people of color" at which whites
were barred from speaking.</TE>
<TE>   "If white men weren't complaining, it would be an indication that
we weren't succeeding," retorts New York Times publisher Arthur
Sulzberger Jr. to such criticisms, in an in-house Times newsletter
quoted by McGowan. Sulzberger, a crusader for what he calls "managed
diversity" in the nation's newsrooms, adds that no longer can news be
reported only from a "white, male and straight" perspective. McGowan
pairs that with former Los Angeles Times publisher Mark Willes' call
to make his "white male newspaper" more appealing to minorities and
women with stories "more emotional, more personal and less analytic."
You wonder whether these elite white men and their collaborators of
color downstairs can tell "white" from wrong or "male" from stale.
George Orwell or Lionel Trilling could have explained how such
groupthink multiplies blunders.</TE>
<TE>   But McGowan's political groupthink produces blunders of its own.
He doesn't acknowledge that while liberal guilt certainly drives
moralizing, the corruption of diversity is more corporate than
"liberal." He touts the conservative editorial pages of the Wall
Street Journal and Fox TV News as trustworthy alternatives to liberal
bias, as if they had no pieties, phony crusades and buried stories of
their own. They and most other conservative team players have given
his book great play. I've long damned such devil's bargains, and
McGowan hasn't escaped this one by putting me in his acknowledgments.
He's caught in the left-versus-right paralysis of public discourse,
in which each ideological camp is right about how the other is wrong
yet too partisan to follow its truths wherever they lead.</TE>
<TE>   "The profession would be better off," McGowan acknowledges, if it
hired not more conservatives but more "journalists who possessed
skepticism, a regard for hard truth and an impatience with the
'smelly little orthodoxies,' as Orwell described them." So why
doesn't he cheer when the "liberal" press catches wind of itself and
cleans up a little? In 1998, the New York Times and its Sunday
magazine began producing some work on racial districting, bilingual
education, affirmative action, hate crimes and even the supposed
statesmanship of the Rev. Al Sharpton that all but rebuked editorial
page "diversity" mantras that had framed the paper's mind-set. Stung
by criticism like mine, the paper also cranked out a decent but dull
"How Race Is Lived" series but then repackaged it for book
publication in pious, editorial groupthink.</TE>
<TE>   It's too soon to claim that McGowan is only fighting the last war.
This country's vast race industry of activists, consultants,
foundation officers, civil rights lawyers and government monitors
enhances its funding, job lines and moral cachet by playing up bad
racial news and discounting the good. Whatever his mistakes, McGowan
is right to argue that journalists should be investigating the race
industry, not working for it.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Henning Mankell's "One Step Behind," it's summer in southern
Sweden and it's been raining a lot. Inspector Kurt Wallander of the
Ystad police has lost the father whom he loved and the woman whom he
thought he loved. His daughter lives in Stockholm. The police are
understaffed and lack resources. Crime has the upper hand and the
judicial system has capitulated. He's fiftysomething, lonely,
depressed, overworked, easily exhausted and liable to drop off to
sleep unexpectedly. The doctor tells him he has diabetes and has to
look after himself, but there's no time for that.</TE>
<TE>   A smug and baleful murderer is on the loose, killing capriciously,
unpredictably, without apparent motive. Is a lunatic perpetrating
this meticulous, apparently random bloodshed or is it a murderously
nutty sect? With little to go by, Wallander and his sleepless cohorts
stumble ahead, but their weary efforts seem to get nowhere. Always
one step behind, they can't prevent the killings and the dread
prospect of still more to come. Baffled, caught in a net of
frustration and media attention, Wallander is more Wallander-esque
than ever: blunder-prone, burdened by bouts of absent-mindedness and
by sudden rages, yet steadfastly professional, dogged, tenacious and
brilliantly intuitive. Which is good but doesn't really change much
because society is bad.</TE>
<TE>   Mankell continues to be a master of atmosphere and suspense. His
deliberate pace stresses the murk and mayhem barely concealed by the
facade of everyday routine. Even his digressions enhance the tension
of the tale. But Mankell's mood gets darker by the book, and his tone
becomes ever more politically, socially and psychopathologically
correct--or perhaps just down in the mouth. Is that a sign of age? Or
just a hard, disillusioned look at the world around?</TE>
<TE>   Sallie Bissell's "A Darker Justice" is another page-turner: a
chiller that delivers thrills as fast as it telegraphs them. Someone
is knocking off federal judges and we know why. A coven of religious
lunatics and rich, powerful men is scheming to get richer and more
powerful still by getting a television preacher elected president.
They have been offing congressional incumbents for years and getting
their own candidates elected in their stead. Now they have cooked up
a wacky prediction and broadcast it on the Internet: When it is
fulfilled and the last judge is purged, it should bolster the
electoral fortunes of their candidate for the White House.</TE>
<TE>   The next and last victim on their list is strong-minded Judge
Irene Hannah of the 4th Circuit, who sits on the appellate court in
Richmond, Va., but lives on her farm in the mountains of western
North Carolina, where she raises Appalachian Mountain horses quite
close (unbeknownst to her) to the hellhounds' lair. Because Hannah
won't let the FBI protect her, they bring in Atlanta prosecutor Mary
Crow to do the job. Though feisty, the two women don't do very well
in the self-protection department until, with the help of a young
boy, Crow turns the tables on the villains and their vile schemes
turn to rubble.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a fast-moving story, elegantly told, in which Bissell (who
is unfashionably big on loyalty and friendship) weaves a palpitating
web of sinuously deadly suspense.</TE>
<TE>   Iain McDowall's "A Study in Death" is a study in self-indulgence.
It has a battered corpse, a basketful of suspects, a covey of police
officers easily distracted from their investigations, a major
computer system disemboweled as part of a murky scam and a beefy
blackguard on the run getting into trouble when he shouldn't. It even
features a New Age community in the picturesque Lake District and a
slew of other photogenic northern England venues, with Amsterdam
thrown in for good measure and a long-distance call to UCLA, where
the vic was about to take up an appointment in the History
Department.</TE>
<TE>   How, then, does McDowall manage to turn this gold into dross? The
nearest I can come to an answer is: incoherence. The Brits get their
man, of course, but that is not the point, and even resolution comes
as an afterthought. The characters' recurrent soul-searchings and
soliloquies slow the action, of which there is not much in the first
place. The cutting's too fast, episodes mesh poorly and it's hard to
keep track of characters or engage with them. The whole exercise is
reminiscent of "Gosford Park" on speed. You're never sure what's
being said, who's saying what or why you should pay attention.
Perhaps you should not.</TE>

<DH>The difficulty of distilling 60,000 missives into drama has
meant 'War Letters' is a work in progress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IRENE LACHER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a sense, a play such as "War Letters" is the essence of theater
for an actor. If theater means convincing an audience that you're
someone you're not and never could have been, then "War Letters" may
present the ultimate challenge.</LD>
<LD>   The nascent play, opening today at the Canon Theatre in Beverly
Hills, is conceived, directed and performed by a group of people
who've never set foot on a battlefield. Yet they're so intense about
the production that they've been approaching it almost as though it
were a mission, particularly since Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   "I want this project to make war real, to make it human, to bring
it to life, so that for other people it's not abstract," Andrew
Carroll says. Carroll, 32, is sitting in a small conference room next
door to the theater, talking about the "project"--the Legacy Project,
his campaign to save and disseminate America's war letters, an
often-poignant cache of memories about what it was like to live
through wartime, from the Civil War to the present day.</LD>
<TE>   The Legacy Project began with a simple letter to Dear Abby and has
unearthed 60,000 more. He solicited the letters in a Nov. 11, 1998,
Abby column, triggering a chain of multimedia dominoes, including an
acclaimed PBS documentary that aired last December.</TE>
<TE>   "When you've lost something that was very valuable and you hear
people were intentionally discarding it, that's very troubling," he
says. "So I got this idea to start this organization called the
Legacy Project, which was only meant to encourage people to save
their letters."</TE>
<TE>   The first outgrowth of the Legacy Project surfaced last May, when
Scribner published  "War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence From
American Wars." The book, which later made the New York Times
bestseller list, contained 200 letters edited by Carroll about
combat, God, love and death from the Civil War through the Gulf War.
Since then, Carroll has been helping director Philip Himberg,
artistic director of the Sundance Theatre Program, and playwright
Paul Selig with the difficult task of molding a coherent, compelling
play from the dense clay of a 472-page book.</TE>
<TE>   Himberg's other collaborators include the actors themselves--two
celebrities who will be replaced every few weeks, starting with Treat
Williams and Mario Van Peebles, and three permanent cast members:
Tony Abatemarco, Nichole Pelerine and Sybyl Walker.</TE>
<TE>   Himberg, Williams and Van Peebles all remember the Vietnam War but
never served. For most of Carroll's life, America has been at peace.
Yet all of them say the letters have connected them to the experience
of war in a way they'd never imagined.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how much your family tells you about someone, no matter
how much they talk about your grandfather or uncle, when someone puts
pen to paper and expresses themselves, that person's personality just
comes through in a way it hadn't before," says Williams, whose uncle
died in World War II at age 19. "It's probably the greatest legacy
anyone can leave."</TE>
<TE>   How did a group of people, several of whom opposed the Vietnam
War, come to be immersed in a project bent on communicating the
experience of war? How did their understanding of war make the leap
from an abstract concept to something so heartfelt they were
compelled to express it through art?</TE>
<TE>   For Carroll, the journey began in 1990, when he was an English
major at Columbia University. He remembers a life-changing call from
his father, saying the family home in Washington, D.C., had gone up
in flames. Carroll came home to an empty shell.</TE>
<TE>   "I went up to where my closet had been, and the thing that struck
me was that all the letters were gone," he says. "I thought it would
be an inconvenience to re-create my whole library of books and CDs,
but the letters couldn't be replaced. I had a friend who'd been in
Tiananmen Square the June the massacre took place. He was writing
these riveting letters about what it was like to be there. And then
just letters from girlfriends, letters from buddies, letters from my
parents that I'd kept and really took for granted until they were
gone. And that's what got me interested in letters."</TE>
<TE>   His first venture was compiling and editing "Letters of a Nation:
A Collection of Extraordinary American Letters" (1997), which
illuminated 350 years of American history through the missives of
unknowns as well as the celebrated and the notorious. In researching
the chapter on war, Carroll was particularly struck by the words of
veterans.</TE>
<TE>   "There were Navajo code-talkers," he says. "They used the Navajo
language as our military code in the South Pacific because it's not
mathematical and you couldn't figure it out. So I was talking to
these veterans, and I said, 'I'd love to see your letters. We'd love
to get some unpublished material in the book.' They said, 'We just
threw them away.'"</TE>
<TE>   In his letter to Abby, Carroll urged Americans to preserve their
letters and send him copies. As the missives poured in, some the work
of unsung poets who died soon after the letters were written, he
realized he had the makings of another book. He also discovered that
approaching the material as an outsider posed a distinct advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "How to go through 50,000 letters and pick 200? I started out
thinking I was the last person who should do this project. But then
you say, 'OK, I'm not a war buff. I'm not a military person. Does
this hold my interest? Is there something gripping about this letter,
something insightful? If I get bored after a couple of lines, then
the reader is going to get bored.'"</TE>
<TE>   He consulted with some of the families who'd contributed letters
that made the cut and decided to donate any book proceeds to
veterans' organizations. (Carroll makes his living as executive
director of the American Poetry &amp; Literacy Project in Washington,
which promotes literacy by distributing free books of poetry,
including 100,000 slim volumes at the Salt Lake City Olympics. He
founded the organization in 1993 with the late Nobel laureate Joseph
Brodsky.)</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed unfair to profit from what was incredibly sacred
material," Carroll says. "So that was the genesis of the whole thing.
There was no intention of doing a book, a PBS documentary, certainly
not a play."</TE>
<TE>   The idea to adapt "War Letters" for the stage  was hatched by
Himberg, who heard Carroll discussing the project on National Public
Radio a year and a half ago. The broadcast was pegged to an
exhibition of letters at the Smithsonian Institution, which was
commemorated with readings by such Beltway notables as John McCain
and Cokie Roberts.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end, the announcer said that they were all 'last letters,'
and none of the men had come back," Himberg says. "It took my breath
away. I drove to my office and called NPR, which turned me on to
Andrew Carroll."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll sent him galleys of the book, and Himberg suggested
skimming the cream for a reading in Los Angeles so he could see
whether the letters had theatrical potential. To adapt the letters
for the stage, he recruited the New York-based Selig, who'd worked
with the Sundance Theatre Lab three years earlier to develop "Mystery
School," a one-character play later produced in New York with Tyne
Daly as the star. "Letters are like monologues, and the 'Mystery
School' piece was a series of monologues," Himberg says. "How do you
get a single person onstage to tell a story in a way that's
interesting?"</TE>
<TE>   Selig quickly produced a first script using 35 letters that he
edited with Carroll's blessing. A free reading at the Canon was
pegged to the book's launch shortly before Memorial Day. The staging
was incredibly simple. Twelve actors--some unknowns and some
celebrities, such as David Hyde Pierce, Tom Skerritt, Gerald McRaney
and Esai Morales--sat in chairs onstage and stood to read their
letters. A narrator at a lectern quoted from the book to put the
letters in context, and Maureen McGovern and Charlayne Woodard
punctuated the reading with songs.</TE>
<TE>   The audience members were enthusiastic, some applauding individual
letters and staying behind to talk about them.</TE>
<TE>   "It became apparent that the letters were in fact adaptable for
the stage," Himberg says. "They didn't all work, but the stories were
compelling and the voices were interesting, and altogether they did
tell a story about the country. The letters were moving because they
were written by young people in extraordinary circumstances,
searching their souls to express a myriad of emotions. People had
compassion for these people in a way they didn't expect. Including
me.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I had given a whole lot of thought to these voices
before. Even though my father was in World War II, he was in a
generation that never spoke about it. Then Vietnam came around, and
we were so polarized that there wasn't the ability to look beyond the
political into the human. So there was enough excitement about it to
move forward."</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Sundance Theatre lent its imprimatur to the
project, Himberg developed the play on his own. The theater program,
which predates Sundance's film arm by a year, helps playwrights
develop their work in its Theatre Laboratory, mounts classic American
musicals for its Utah neighbors, and commissions and produces plays
for young audiences. What it hasn't done is produce its own
plays--although Himberg would like to change that.</TE>
<TE>   "The lab isn't a place for me to work," he says. "It's a place for
me to provide space for someone else to work. There is something
ironic in the fact that I have one of the most prolific theaters in
the country and 'War Letters' wasn't developed there."</TE>
<TE>   That was also a function of timing. For a few months after the
reading, the project found a niche on the back burner. Then Sept. 11
happened.</TE>
<TE>   "The letters that were resonant already became even more so," he
says. "I was sitting around like a lot of theater people saying, 'Is
my life important?' When it came to choosing a musical for next
summer, I thought, 'I'm not doing "No, No, Nanette." I can't do that
with my life anymore.'"</TE>
<TE>   Less than two weeks later, Himberg brought up the hibernating "War
Letters" project during a lunch with Canon producer Susan Dietz.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when it got on the fast track. She said, 'I have a
theater, and "Vagina Monologues" is closing, so let's think about
it.' The lab is in the summer, so we decided to do the development
process on our own. We started writing and rewriting and reshaping.
It was crazy. It was fast. It's been development and production
happening together."</TE>
<TE>   Himberg watched the PBS documentary based on the book but decided
to start fresh. He also concluded that the show should borrow only a
couple of elements from other recent plays based on letters and
monologues--A.R. Gurney's "Love Letters" and Eve Ensler's "Vagina
Monologues." He incorporated a rotating guest cast of celebrities to
entice audiences and offer busy Hollywood stalwarts a chance to do
theater. But he wanted his show to be more theatrical. He didn't want
to imitate those plays, which chained actors to seats onstage where
they read from a script.</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought that was too static," he says. "By the nature of
having two [celebrity] guests, you can't get them blocked into the
play in a day or two. But I don't want people sitting at desks. It
isn't theatrical. I thought creating stage pictures and some tableaux
and some movement makes the experience more than a reading,
particularly with the [permanent] ensemble. They use the letters as a
prop, but they know them by heart. Some are read. It's a challenge.
We're reading letters, but we're trying to interpret them and give
them physicality."</TE>
<TE>   Himberg and Selig consulted with Carroll and replaced nearly half
the letters from the May reading with more compelling alternatives.
They also dropped the narrator, which slowed things down, and
arranged the letters chronologically to provide context. To further
enhance the sense of time and place, Himberg enlisted projection,
lighting and sound designers.</TE>
<TE>   The monologues are interspersed with music and illustrated with
diverse backdrop projections of battlefields, medals and the letters
themselves. Perhaps the most arresting example is a missive written
on Adolf Hitler's letterhead with the Fuhrer's name crossed out and
the liberating American soldier's penned in.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the biggest challenge has been the script. "These are real
letters, not love letters by Pete Gurney," Himberg says. "And the
challenge is how to make the material theatrical. How do you make a
letter work as a story? Some worked better than others. You can drop
words, but you can't invent words. That's how the letters were
written."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the writers are famous, among them Clara Barton and Colin
Powell, who tells a curious first-grade class that yes, he has been
scared, he eats snacks and he watches a lot of television. Some offer
an unsettling perspective on war rarely heard. In one, a black
soldier during World War II writes about watching German prisoners of
war enjoy themselves at a restaurant in the American South while the
soldier is forced to eat in the kitchen. A mother who has lost her
son in the Vietnam War, praying he hasn't died in vain, asks "If a
war is worth fighting, isn't it worth fighting to win?"</TE>
<TE>   But it isn't all darkness. Humor springs up like grass amid broken
concrete. One World War II soldier writes a letter trying to seduce a
woman he hasn't met by using an unusual come-on: "I have a nicely
formed nose. It's visible from a distance of 14 miles."</TE>
<TE>   The first preview was two weeks ago, and Carroll raced from the
airport to see it. He was delighted to find that hearing the letters
read aloud by professional actors created a whole new dimension, even
for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I could not be more happy with how they're interpreting them,"
Carroll says. "I happen to know some of the people [who wrote the
letters] in real life, and I know their personalities are different,
but it's still a great reading of that letter. You look at it on the
page, and it's all black text on white, and here you see different
people and different voices with different accents, and you think,
wow, it's come to life."</TE>
<TE>   The show is still being polished, and each performance is slightly
different from the one the day before, perhaps incorporating a new
ending, letter, music or projection.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest difficulty," Williams says, "and I must say with all
due respect to Philip our director, is finding a connecting thread to
the letters, so the evening doesn't sound disjointed. I think at the
moment some of the letters may not work. It's very difficult. It's
neither fish nor fowl."</TE>
<TE>   The "War Letters" team also wants to keep the play fresh and
topical by adding new missives related to the Afghanistan conflict
and perhaps Los Angeles as well. Still, they aren't fazed by their
complex task. The show may be a work in progress, but then so is the
world.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ft. HUNTER LIGGETT--Director Randall Wallace is staring intently at a
playback monitor as Mel Gibson, who's starring in his Vietnam War
story "We Were Soldiers," sneaks up behind him. Arrayed all around
the two, on the dusty slopes of this remote Army installation
northwest of Paso Robles on a breezy May afternoon, are about 200
cinematic soldiers Wallace is putting through their paces.</LD>
<LD>   This is Wallace's second directorial effort (his first, 1998's
"The Man in the Iron Mask," was a marginal success), and at a cost of
about $75 million, it's no light burden. Gibson stealthily reaches
under Wallace's chair for the director's bullhorn--the actor is a
well-known prankster and there's something of the naughty-by-nature
schoolboy in his manner--then pensively squeezes it on. His whisper
is so muted that only those in a tidy 10-foot circle can hear its
electronically filtered output, in a deeply Teutonic accent. As
Wallace's head tilts down ever so slightly in response, Gibson asks,
"Iz this some futile attempt to make a tense human drama?"</LD>
<TE>   The ultimate answer to that question lies ahead of them, but
there's no disputing that a tense human drama is Wallace's goal.
While this film is an adaptation of a celebrated and best-selling
true account of battle ("We Were Soldiers Once and Young"),
co-written by a senior officer and a journalist who lived through the
prolonged firefight at Ia Drang Valley in 1965, Wallace has expanded
the story's emotionality by digging deeper into the book's compactly
sketched story of the women left behind.</TE>
<TE>   The footage he's shooting makes for a bloody, wrenching saga. But
by devoting itself in part to the home front and to a careful
presentation of the North Vietnamese soldiers as worthy and
intelligent adversaries, Wallace's war story bids to give Paramount
Pictures something to work with in distinguishing it from producer
Jerry Bruckheimer and director Ridley Scott's formidable "Black Hawk
Down."</TE>
<TE>   The eruption of that picture from an unknown quantity (would it
seem too tough, too downbeat, in the wake of Sept. 11?) into a
box-office smash with a collection of rave reviews and four Oscar
nominations, including one for director Scott, could make for a
bitter irony for Wallace. As Bruckheimer's choice for screenwriter of
"Pearl Harbor," Wallace avowed he'd aimed for a love story as much as
a war epic--then watched the film take its hardest critical hits for
the love-triangle subplot.</TE>
<TE>   Before the jeers had fully died away, Bruckheimer was beating
Wallace's own war film into the marketplace with "Black Hawk Down's"
unsparingly combat-driven story of American troops in battle in
Somalia. After a complex dance around a December release date,
"Soldiers" retreated to a March 1 release, while "Black Hawk Down"
began a wider release.</TE>
<TE>   The picture's strong reception certified Scott's growing
reputation as an auteur for the mass audience, even as Wallace was
left to keep crafting his own story that matched the rough outline of
"Black Hawk"--an epochal (if unsung) battle in which American troops
fought their way out of encirclement by a much larger hostile force.
Now, much of the burden will fall on Gibson, who must prove once more
that his $25-million salary is some guarantee of major box-office
success.</TE>
<TE>   The film and Gibson may also be magnets for the story's sharply
pro-military politics. If "Black Hawk Down" was called jingoistic and
even racist by some pundits, "Soldiers," despite obvious efforts to
humanize the Vietnamese foes, may draw fire for such chest-beating,
soldierly lines as Gibson's improvised prayer at the end of a
heart-to-heart chat in the base chapel, which ends with " ... and
help us blow the little bastards straight to hell."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Gibson is wearing his crown as lightly as the straw hat he
sometimes dons between takes in place of his olive-drab steel pot. He
keys the bullhorn again, as Wallace good-naturedly ignores him.
Gibson continues in the insinuating kommandant's tone, which he
identifies as "Klaus" (and is later revealed to be a twisted parody
of German-born Roland Emmerich, who directed Gibson in "The
Patriot"): "Even you must realize zis is hopeless."</TE>
<TE>   The path of retired Lt. Gen. Hal Moore's story from its dusty,
bloody unfolding in Vietnam's Ia Drang Valley to theater screens has
been a long and arduous one. It's a story that would wait 27 years to
emerge in the form of Moore's book, co-written with Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist Joseph Galloway, and 10 more years to be
seen on screen.</TE>
<TE>   What delayed those steps into the public arena was not so much
America's complicated feelings about Vietnam, but the authors'
unwillingness to take any chance that the memory of fallen American
soldiers would be maligned. (There were also many survivors whose
legacy needed protecting and who shared their mistrust of any
retelling by those who weren't there.) As Gibson will point out in an
interview as soon as he puts down the bullhorn, the authors planted
an admonition in the book's prologue: "Hollywood got it wrong every
damn time, whetting twisted political knives on the bones of our dead
brothers."</TE>
<TE>   To discuss this film with Moore, Galloway or Wallace is to enter
into a zone of fairly high-toned (and indisputably sincere)
discourse. Even when preparing a group of unbilled and anonymously
green-clad extras for a bayonet charge, Wallace issues his open-ended
instructions by paraphrasing a line from his screenplay for "The Man
in the Iron Mask": "You've got to decide," he hollers in a Tennessee
drawl that somehow always sounds laid-back, "whether you're taking a
life or giving a life."</TE>
<TE>   The events of November 1965 were deadly indeed. The four-day
struggle around two hastily chosen landing zones during the Ia Drang
campaign in the Central Highlands of Vietnam was that war's first
major battle, costing 235 American lives (with 245 wounded) and an
estimated 2,000 North Vietnamese lives. The events of Wallace's film
are mostly confined to the ferocious fight Moore led around the
clearing called Landing Zone X-Ray, where 79 of his troops died; a
subsequent battle at Landing Zone Albany, where his group's
replacements died more quickly and under far less able command, is
suggested by radio traffic near the film's end, but not seen.</TE>
<TE>   Moore was a 42-year-old who had taken over his first battalion
just months before the fight. As the leader of a somewhat
experimental command within the 7th Cavalry (whose best-known soldier
was once Gen. George Armstrong Custer, to whom the blond-haired,
strapping Moore was sometimes compared), paratrooper Moore's mandate
was to bring the fight to the guerrilla enemy in the still-developing
Vietnam conflict by rushing into hot zones via 110-mph Huey
helicopters carrying his troopers. "His mission that day was 'to find
the enemy and kill him,'" says Gibson, whose knowledge of Moore's
life goes much deeper than the book, and was learned face-to-face in
numerous sessions with Moore.</TE>
<TE>   UPI war correspondent Galloway was "one day shy of my 24th
birthday" when he approached an officer at a fire base asking to be
flown by helicopter to the location of Moore's troops. He was raised
in Refugio, Texas, as heir to a long warrior tradition. (His
great-grandparents met as a result of the ad hoc friendship of two
Civil War vets, each of whom had had one leg amputated; the two would
meet periodically to buy a shared pair of shoes.) He broke the cycle
with his decision to cover wars rather than fight them. He'd been "in
country" for some months.</TE>
<TE>   In the melee at LZ X-Ray, in which 79 Americans were killed,
Galloway had out-hustled the other reporters (including pre-CNN Peter
Arnett) at a fire base near the battle and asked to hop a ride to the
action. Moore simply said, "If he's crazy enough, let him come.... "
Galloway would win a Bronze Star, many years later, for his valor in
defending the beleaguered unit's patch of turf.</TE>
<TE>   The juxtaposition of Moore, a West Point graduate and student of
military history, with a crackerjack reporter such as Galloway (he
would eventually win a Pulitzer Prize for the 1990 U.S. News and
World Report story of the battle) has made their account of the
battle a landmark; it was reviewed on the front of the New York Times
Book Review upon publication in October 1990 and sold out its initial
print run. The sales and the praise have steadily continued. (A cut
of all the proceeds, including its life as a film, goes to a
foundation the authors established for underwriting the education of
the surviving families of American troops.)</TE>
<TE>   Having lived through the haunting hours on the ground, however,
made the authors resolute that the story wouldn't be squandered or
exploited. "We listened to wannabe producers for a year and a half,"
recalls Galloway, "not hearing what we wanted to hear. We fired our
agent and agreed between us that maybe the film would be made years
after our death, but we would not stand there and watch them destroy
[the story]."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace would prove to be uniquely suited to persuading the
lifelong friends that the film version could satisfy them. A religion
major at Duke University, he'd considered signing up as a chaplain to
the Marines in Vietnam but spent a year in seminary school instead;
by the time he finished school and his student deferment ran out,
Saigon had fallen.</TE>
<TE>   He emerged to take a crack at songwriting (while running the
animal shows at Nashville's Opryland), then turned to novels, earning
good reviews but making no money. His wife was expecting their
firstborn when they visited his ancestral Scotland and saw a statue
of William Wallace, who would become the focus of "Braveheart." But
he worked for years in episodic television on the order of Stephen
Cannell's "Sonny Spoon" before finally taking his shot with the
"Braveheart" script that attracted Gibson's attention and 1995 Oscar
wins for best picture and best director (Wallace's screenplay was
nominated as well).</TE>
<TE>   What counted more toward Wallace's dream of making "We Were
Soldiers" was that with two war sagas under his belt, he was a man
who could speak Moore and Galloway's language. Wallace had persuaded
Moore and Galloway in 1994 to sell him the option on the book, and
he'd been renewing it yearly (at his own expense) at $10,000 per
year.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations heated up in January 1999 when he visited Moore at
Crested Butte, Colo., where Moore had helped run a ski resort for a
while after retiring from the Army. (Gibson had taken an interest in
the screenplay his "Braveheart" colleague had been nurturing.)
Wallace had also visited the cemetery at Ft. Benning, Ga., with
Moore, who would periodically pray over the graves of the men he'd
lost in 1965. Moore paid the same respects from his local chapel.
"Mel really sparked to that," says Wallace, "and he said, 'Look, when
he comes out here, I would like to have a Mass said for his dead
soldiers.'"</TE>
<TE>   In early 2000, Moore arrived in Los Angeles and was driven to
Gibson's Malibu home. Near there, in a chapel Gibson sponsors with
donations, a Costa Rican priest said a Mass in Latin. When it was
done, Moore and Gibson, "both conservative Catholics," understood
each other, Wallace recalls, noting "Hal was powerfully moved."</TE>
<TE>   Mounting the production was fairly complex. With Gibson's
production company, Icon, willing to put up a little more than half
the film's cost--for which it would own the foreign distribution
rights--Paramount Pictures readily agreed to co-finance the film and
distribute it domestically. A three-month production schedule began
in mid-March, with the principal cast members who would portray
Moore's soldiers reporting to Ft. Benning for indoctrination in the
ways of the Army, and more specifically, the Air Cavalry.</TE>
<TE>   Gibson arrived when the rest of the gang had already been at work
for a week: "I went to Ft. Benning and did the wimp course," says
Gibson typically underselling the rigors he endured, "some crawling
in the mud, running around with the guys," half-kiddingly adding that
at age 44, "it's not getting any easier." Mostly, he concentrated on
Moore, absorbing the man's philosophy and, almost as important, his
bearing: "It's not so much what he physically looks like, it's all
about the way he expresses himself. It's for real, it's
uncompromising and there's a lot of heart there."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Klein knew that as Lt. Jack Geoghegan, he would need to
represent not the seasoned warrior Gibson would portray, but a young,
by-the-book, military-school grad. Klein appealed to his Army
instructors: "I sat the guys down and said, 'Look, all the running
and everything, all that's good, and I can do that. I've got my Nikes
in my truck. But I wanna know who a second lieutenant talks to, who
he looks in the eye, how he shakes hands, the proper salute, who I
respect and who respects me.... I want to be a soldier. Show me how
to stand."</TE>
<TE>   A crucial part of Wallace's vision was to include Geoghegan's wife
(played by Keri Russell), who is mentored by Moore's wife (played by
Madeleine Stowe). These characters embody the psychic toll of the war
back home--as the telegrams telling of the casualties arrive, as in
real life, in the hands of abashed cab drivers.</TE>
<TE>   The one man who seemed to be on olive-drab autopilot from the
beginning was Sam Elliott, as Sgt. Major Plumley, a noncom in his
third war whom Moore greatly relied on. Moore laughingly recalls how
Elliott (who regularly staged inspections of his junior acting
colleagues in their barracks at Ft. Benning) actually roamed the
parade ground where Gibson's character was about to give a steely,
inspirational speech, spotting flaws in the gear and comportment of
the real-life soldiers who had been loaned to the production for the
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that I've ever played a part where I had more
respect for the man," Elliott said. "I think that comes primarily
from the fact that I did have an opportunity to meet him and talk to
people who knew him." The long-retired Plumley loaned Elliott the
knife he'd carried the day of the battle, just as Galloway got out
his old Nikon cameras and loaned them to Barry Pepper, the young
actor who portrayed him.</TE>
<TE>   Pepper, arranging his gear in the trailer before an afternoon on
the set, spoke of the similarities between Gibson and Tom Hanks,
another $25-million man who had led him into war (Pepper played the
Scripture-quoting sniper in "Saving Private Ryan").</TE>
<TE>   "They [Gibson and Hanks] just make you feel so comfortable, so at
ease being around them that you're able to just free yourself and do
your work rather than worry about the sort of Hollywood hierarchy and
the dog-and-pony show that sometimes exists on these big pictures,"
Pepper says. "Mel's just one of the guys. He's an alpha male dog, so
filled with testosterone and energy."</TE>
<TE>   Pepper, fresh from a well-received portrayal of Yankee slugger
Roger Maris in HBO's "61*," speaks warmly of Galloway, whose Bronze
Star is the only one awarded by the Army to a civilian for action in
Vietnam. "He walked onto that battlefield a witness and walked off a
soldier. It's really hard to comprehend, especially for young men of
my generation, what it takes to step up like that.... Lions in
winter, these guys. They've seen and done things that we, hopefully,
never will have to do."</TE>
<TE>   This afternoon on the set, Gibson will be fairly heroic himself.
As the helicopter pilots block out a scene with second unit director
Allen Graff (a burly former USC football star), Graff asks Wallace,
"Randy, we're gonna see the choppers coming in--would you want Mel to
go in that direction?"</TE>
<TE>   Wallace spots two Hueys that are at present still on the ground,
squeezed so tightly into the narrow landing zone that to consider
planting a human being near them when they fly in causes a little
chill down the back. "Yeah," says Wallace, "I'll talk to him about
it." But Gibson, who's been studiously field-stripping the cigarette
he's just finished, has been quietly attentive to what they're
planning.</TE>
<TE>   "Watch the downdraft, Mel," is Graff's last instruction." "Watch
the downdraft," mutters Gibson, a world of dry humor in his squint.
"Watch when those blades start clicking together." He studies his
helmet interior before strapping it on. "Boy," he says before making
a whickering series of tongue noises meant to simulate rotor shards
snapping through steel into tissue, "glad I had that on."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace, who just the previous night ripped his Achilles tendon in
a pickup hoops game, is squinting in either pain or concentration as
the helicopters are loaded with "wounded" and finally pound back into
the sky.</TE>
<TE>   A few yards to the side, Pepper is taking motherly care of his
grit-coated Nikons, grinning at the sight of Gibson so loose between
takes, after so embodying Moore when the cameras rolled. For "Saving
Private Ryan," Pepper recalls, director Steven Spielberg had an Irish
priest come down to a wide field of thistle to say a prayer before
principal photography started. "The cast and crew all gathered around
and bowed their heads in prayer. Whether you're a religious man or
not, there's something spiritually powerful there that connects you
to the remembrance of the men and women you're portraying.</TE>
<TE>   "That's sort of what we're hoping to achieve with this film. Some
sense of healing for those people that 30 ... 40 years later can't
seem to differentiate between the political and the personal Vietnam.
The memories of all of the young boys that sacrificed their lives for
what they thought was right at the time. It's just so sad--the early
stages of Vietnam just totally got buried by the later stages where
things got so horrific and out of control."</TE>
<TE>   Gibson has wandered to the middle of the set, running a testing
finger through the compound of real sweat and dirt that has fused
with what started out as dirt makeup on his neck and jaw. He's not
one given to a Method actor's disappearance into his role, but now he
speaks of Moore as if "the old man" (as his troops, by foot soldier
convention, knew their leader) were reliving these scenes along with
him. "He sees boys going down, and he's thinking about his own kids,
because these troops were his family, and he felt the responsibility
to keep those guys alive. And when they would go down, it would get
to him. Pretty bad. He wasn't the kind of guy that would break down;
he carried on. But it got to him.</TE>
<TE>   "And you're cutting back to the wives, you know, the telegrams,
and how do they deal with that? You get to know them and their kids
and you get a little insight into their hell, which is, almost as
bad.... I think that's an aspect that hasn't really been focused on
in this genre before, so it sort of sets this film apart."</TE>
<TE>   For Moore, who still prays over his dead soldiers, and still goes
to the Vietnam Memorial to commune in his fashion with the men under
his command whose names are engraved there, the point of the film,
and the lesson of Vietnam, is a fairly simple one.</TE>
<TE>   "We hoped our book would do honor, and the movie will do honor, to
those men who traveled 12,000 miles to that place. You can get killed
just as dead in a rice paddy or field in Vietnam as on the Normandy
beachhead. For the same flag. And for the same country."</TE>

<HD>Tapping the Roots</HD>
<DH>Led by Martin Scorsese, PBS' 'The Blues' mixes fiction and
fact to get at the nitty-gritty of the most American of sounds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>VICKSBURG, Miss.</DL>
<LD>When "The Blues" production crew rolled into town, the workers must
have smacked their hands together. They didn't need to scrape the
paint off any houses. They didn't need to pull down any fences. They
didn't have to sprinkle idle old men along the road. All was there.
Vicksburg was behaving beautifully.</LD>
<LD>   Here in one of the city's most unchanging neighborhoods was a
bona-fide blues scene aching to be filmed. At a busted-window joint
called Slippers, the sound of an art form being revived leaked
through a screen door.</LD>
<LD>   "Mama said I was goin' to be in a movie, yeah, Mama said I was
goin' to be a star," one man sang in the slanting doorway. "And she
shooooo' was right!"</LD>
<TE>   "Dancers! Dancers!" one of the assistants yelled past him. "Come
on, let's get this shoot done!"</TE>
<TE>   "The Blues" is a gutsy PBS series in the works, dreamed up by
Martin Scorsese, that strives to deposit a little grit on the screen
and, in a way, spice up drama with real life.</TE>
<TE>   Part documentary, part not, it's six separate films, each crafted
by a different director, tracing the evolution of the blues and how
the music has helped express--and shape--the black experience.
Scorsese is directing one installment, as are Wim Wenders and Mike
Figgis, among others. The series is scheduled to air in fall 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a conscious decision early on that this was not going to
be an encyclopedic approach to the blues," said series producer Alex
Gibney, whose credits include the documentaries "The Fifties" and
"The Pacific Century." "Our films are going to be personal and
impressionistic. We thought this would be the best agent provocateur
to turn people on to the music."</TE>
<TE>   No, this won't be like Ken Burns' "Jazz" odyssey, the 10-episode
musical examination that was scrupulously researched but criticized
as a little dry in places. "The Blues" is conceived as a raw,
experiential rendering of the music's history, as frank and
unvarnished as the musicians' sooty lives--but with dramatic accents.
Each segment features a mix of standard documentary elements such as
archival footage, performances and interviews, along with dramatic
reenactments. The twist is that the final product will be a set of
one-hour films, all with a deliberately indie feel and not connected
in any conventional miniseries fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Blues experts say it's about time someone stepped inside the real
blues, the dirty blues, the folksy beats of such places as Slippers.</TE>
<TE>   "You got to get that camera into these honky-tonks and juke joints
and show people having a good time," said Albert Murray, the
celebrated author of numerous essays and books on black culture,
including "Stomping the Blues." "People like to hear Negroes
lamenting, but they don't get it. I never met a blues musician who
wasn't looking for a good time, a bottle of whiskey, and a woman and
a guitar or a piano. You gonna tell me that after working hard all
day in the fields, people wanted to go to a juke joint and hear sad
music? No way!"</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese, the executive producer and a blues aficionado, said this
project evolved from an Eric Clapton documentary he was involved
with. He encouraged each director to shoot as much on location as
possible and explore his relationship to the music. The only
parameters were to keep it to 60 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea for the series is to do something a little different
than what's been done with other music documentaries," said Scorsese.
"I sought out directors with a love for the music and experience, in
both features and documentaries, who would make films that
communicate their passion for and their personal connection to the
music."</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese's own connection to music is deep rooted. He who was an
editor on "Woodstock" and directed the Band's swan song, "The Last
Waltz."</TE>
<TE>   "I came to a deeper appreciation of the blues by way of rock 'n
roll," said the director. "And when I did, I realized that it had
been the foundation for so much of what I had been listening to."</TE>
<TE>   Musician Keb' Mo' (Kevin Moore), who has been a leading
practitioner of acoustic blues traditions in recent years, has clear
notions of what kind of message he'd want a series of this sort to
impart--and, surprisingly, he wouldn't want to see much emphasis on
the very traditions he honors.</TE>
<TE>   "For God's sake, give it a blood transfusion," he says. "Don't
give it a bringing-back-a-dead-corpse-type attitude. Let's look at
the great-great-grandchildren, not overdo it with the dead
great-grandfathers. That's pertinent. You have to look at that.</TE>
<TE>   "But tie it to current R&amp;B artists--the India.Aries, the
D'Angelos. Talk to musicians that you wouldn't expect. Don't look to
me, for example. I'm 50 years old. Show how it's really alive. Go to
the churches. There will be some people who really know the blues
there--blues and gospel are so connected to Southern culture, black
and white."</TE>
<TE>   "The Blues" is a "passion project" (read: low budget), and the
financing comes from Clear Blue Sky Productions, known for the
documentary series "Me &amp; Isaac Newton," and Wenders' Road Movies.
Each episode is estimated to cost $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   The series opens on the banks of the Niger river in the west
African country of Mali. Spike Lee had signed on to film the first
episode but pulled out because of a scheduling conflict. Scorsese
then agreed to step in, even though he had to miss the shooting in
Africa because he'd been engrossed in the final stages of his film
"Gangs of New York."</TE>
<TE>   Lee's withdrawal was a disappointment for many reasons, Gibney
said, not in the least because it left the production with only one
black director: Charles Burnett.</TE>
<TE>   "And that's not something we overlooked," Gibney said. "We reached
out to a number of black filmmakers. Unfortunately, there were
scheduling issues that kept them from working with us."</TE>
<TE>   The first episode, "From Mali to Mississippi," traces the roots of
blues music and the cross-currents between black Africa and the
baleful songs born on the cotton fields of the Deep South. Many of
west Africa's top musicians, such as Ali Farka Toure and Salif Keita,
say they were influenced by Delta blues, which in the formative days
were shaped by rhythms slaves learned in their motherland of Africa.</TE>
<TE>   No music better reflects the times and lives of its pioneering
artists, recently freed slaves facing the ugly world of
Reconstruction.</TE>
<TE>   The blues began as a music of pain--in its pure form, the music
still is--of life in endless, hateful cotton fields and hotblooded
violence and being lonely and broke and black.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by field hollers and spirituals, the blues developed a
distinct call-and-response rhythm in which the singer belts out a
line and the guitar answers it. Often, the first line is repeated. As
one old ballad goes: "I'm going to leave baby, ain't going to say
goodbye, I'm going to leave baby, ain't going to say goodbye. But
I'll write you and tell you the reason why."</TE>
<TE>   The blues is pure oral tradition, one of the best examples of
unfiltered cultural expression, said Peter Aschoff, a University of
Mississippi anthropologist and blues expert.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell my students this music knows a great deal about being
black," Aschoff said, "and that they need to listen."</TE>
<TE>   W.C. Handy, a black composer, first heard these scratchy, folksy
sounds in 1903 while waiting for a train in Tutwiler, Miss. When he
put them down on paper, he marked the birth of popular blues music.</TE>
<TE>   Director Burnett re-created this moment for the series' second
episode ("Warming by the Devil's Fire") on a storming late December
day in Vicksburg. He and his crew were huddling under a caboose
dripping with rain. The scene is a flashback in the story of a young
boy's first exposure to the blues.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as Burnett saw a 50-car freight train steaming his way, he
yelled: "Let's go! Let's go! Let's get this!" and the crew scrambled
to squeeze off one take of the Handy scene with the wet, clattering
train in the background.</TE>
<TE>   Burnett is telling a story, his story, about two warring
uncles--one deeply religious, the other hooked on the blues.</TE>
<TE>   "Growing up," said Burnett, who was born in this Mississippi river
town, "there was always this tension between gospel music, which is a
big part of the Baptist tradition, and the blues, which has all these
dark, suggestive lyrics."</TE>
<TE>   Burnett is something of a guerrilla filmmaker, a 57-year-old
Mississippi transplant who has spent most of his life struggling to
shoot films in South-Central Los Angeles, where he lives. His first
project was a family drama set in Watts. "Killer of Sheep" (1977)
took five years to make, partly because Burnett had promised a role
to a friend in prison, and the friend kept missing parole. The film
won an award at the Berlin International Film Festival, putting
Burnett on the map in Hollywood, and in 1990 it was included in the
National Film Registry by the National Film Preservation Board.</TE>
<TE>   For his next film, he wrote and directed "To Sleep With Anger"
(1990), a subtle, tough story starring Danny Glover as an enigmatic
man from the Deep South who brings trouble along when he visits his
brother's family. The movie, with its references to superstition and
other folklore, is steeped in the blues.</TE>
<TE>   The recent filming in Vicksburg was a homecoming of sorts for
Burnett, who still has family there. The busted-up neighborhood
hasn't changed much in the past 50 years ago, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But what blows me away is the genius and depth and the poetry of
these people," he said. "You sit there and look at the environment
they came from. It's stunning."</TE>
<TE>   The third episode of "The Blues" ("Devil Got My Woman") is
basically a road trip with Wenders, the German feature director who
recently explored the musical documentary genre in "Buena Vista
Social Club."</TE>
<TE>   The next episodes trail the blues upriver, showing such
cotton-country musicians as B.B. King and Howlin' Wolf making it in
Memphis and Chicago and becoming commercial hits. Richard Pearce, who
worked with D.A. Pennebaker on the 1967 Bob Dylan documentary "Don't
Look Back," and whose feature films have often explored racial
themes, directs Episode 4, "Moaning at Midnight." And Marc Levin,
director of "Slam," a gritty movie about urban poetry, is helming the
fifth episode, "Godfathers and Sons."</TE>
<TE>   The sixth film is about British musicians reacquainting Americans
with the blues during the '60s, when rock 'n' roll was taking off and
the blues were fading into obscurity. Mike Figgis, director of
"Leaving Las Vegas," is filming this one.</TE>
<TE>   Blues experts say this is an opportune time to film this project.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing the passing of the last great titans," said Robert
Santelli, one of Scorsese's consultants and the director of the
Experience Music Project in Seattle. He cited the recent deaths of
Rufus Thomas and John Lee Hooker and the advanced state of other
greats such as King, who's 76.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike country music, which succeeded in penetrating the
mainstream and getting radio play, the blues have never been destined
for Top 40.</TE>
<TE>   "But it still has a loyal following, and people are buying the
music," said David Sanjek, director of BMI Archives, a performance
licensing agency. "Though the pure form of the music is endangered,
young musicians are carrying on the tradition, in their own ways."</TE>
<TE>   Today's blues are spiced with funk and jazz and bits of country,
and features more instrumental soloing inspired by rock, Sanjek said.</TE>
<TE>   Aschoff, the anthropologist and blues expert, said he'd like to
see "The Blues" capture this fluidity.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't just put blues music in a museum and freeze it in the
1940s," he said. "The music today is different--but it's equally
relevant to the black experience."</TE>
<TE>   But to Robert Cray, one of the top figures in the current electric
blues world, the most important message the filmmakers can convey is
to be found in the history.</TE>
<TE>   "Life was different [in the Delta of the '20s and '30s]," he says.
"That part needs to be told in this series--how transient life was.
People worked on the plantations or as sharecroppers. They were like
today's migrant workers, moving from area to area. That played a big
part with the bluesmen, following the work and playing when they had
the opportunity. It's going to be great for more people to have the
opportunity to learn about this."</TE>
<TE>   But this series, its makers insist, is not really about history,
but about something more essential.</TE>
<TE>   "The story of the blues has been told," Santelli said. "But what
hasn't been told is the essence of the music and its power. It's
scary, scary music. And when this series comes out, some of this
stuff is going to blow people away."</TE>

<HD>Ever-Modern Moliere</HD>
<DH>New productions argue there's no need to make a 17th
century playwright relevant. He already is.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN BRESLAUER</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Three actors and three large free-standing doors occupy the makeshift
stage in a Mark Taper Forum rehearsal room. The center doorway has an
attached structure and staircase, and serves as backdrop to the three
men, who are gathered in front of it, working out a bit of business.</LD>
<LD>   Even though they're only in rehearsal clothes, the bows and
postures of the younger men on either side suggest immediately that
this is not the present day. What's more, this impression is
reinforced by the man in the middle, who keeps breaking out of his
role as actor to assume the guise of director, adjusting an
inflection or gesture here, discussing a line there.</LD>
<LD>   It takes precision--and humor--to get it right. The
actor-director, Brian Bedford, suggests to one actor that he must
relish the phrasing and language of the rhymed verse even more. The
other is told to take more delight in the information being revealed.
All in the interest of the enterprise they've set for themselves,
bringing the world of 17th century France to the hearts and minds of
21st century Californians.</LD>
<TE>   The men are rehearsing "The Moliere Comedies," a double bill of
"The School for Husbands" and "The Imaginary Cuckold," in a
translation by Richard Wilbur. Directed by and featuring Bedford, the
production opens at the Taper on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   They are not alone. Moliere is in the air. Long a staple of the
classical repertoire but comparatively seldom seen in the Southland,
France's best-known playwright is making more appearances than usual
on major Southern California stages these days. In addition to the
Taper production, South Coast Repertory just closed David Chambers'
staging of "The School for Wives," starring Dakin Matthews. And in
May, La Jolla Playhouse will open its 2002 season with a production
of "Tartuffe," directed by Des McAnuff and starring Jefferson Mays.</TE>
<TE>   The scheduling appears to be no more than an interesting
coincidence, given that the programming decisions behind these
productions were made as many as several years ago and as recently as
this season. What's more, while all three theaters have a history of
occasional forays into the classics--some more occasional than
others--they are all better known as havens for contemporary plays
and playwrights.</TE>
<TE>   Yet is an audience accustomed to Richard Greenberg, John Belluso
or Lee Blessing necessarily ready for--let alone excited
about--Moliere? Such is the question at the heart of the ongoing
debate about how to make period pieces viable for today's audiences.</TE>
<TE>   "People think that by putting a Shakespeare or a Moliere play in
modern dress that they are making it more contemporary for us," says
the soft-spoken and genial Bedford, seated in a Taper office after
rehearsal on a recent evening. "But that is not what makes it
contemporary. It's the actors' understanding of these characters'
psychological makeup.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way to make them contemporary is to go to the very heart
and soul of these things and have your actors manifest that, so the
audience says, 'My God, this play could have been written last
year.'"</TE>
<TE>   The English-born Bedford is highly qualified to discuss the
challenges of the classics. A graduate of the Royal Academy of
Dramatic Art, he is considered one of the premier classical actors of
his generation, often associated with the work of Moliere and
Shakespeare.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Bedford, who is also a veteran director, has
performed many leading roles at the Stratford Festival of Canada and
elsewhere, and appeared on Broadway more than 20 times. Bedford won a
best actor Tony in 1971 for his performance in "The School for Wives"
and since then has received four additional Tony nominations for best
actor.</TE>
<TE>   The Taper production marks the fourth time he has performed "The
School for Husbands" (1661) and "The Imaginary Cuckold" (1660) as a
pair. The two works are emblematic of the longtime collaboration
between Bedford and Wilbur--Bedford first appeared in one of Wilbur's
translations in the '60s--and are dedicated by the translator to the
actor.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995 at the Criterion Center in New York, Michael Langham
directed Bedford in a staging of "The Moliere Comedies" for which the
actor received a Tony nomination. Writing in the New York Times,
Vincent Canby not only praised the production, but cited Bedford for
"giving what are possibly the two best performances by an actor on
Broadway at the moment. He's twice as priceless as characters who, by
coincidence, both happen to be named Sganarelle."</TE>
<TE>   As if dual roles weren't enough, Bedford has also seated himself
in the director's chair. And that means he's responsible for setting
the strategy to bridge the gap between Moliere's time and the
present.</TE>
<TE>   Bedford began by enlisting the cast and creative team in a
discussion of the use and abuse of period style. "I started out this
rehearsal period here by reading at considerable length from a book
called 'The Rediscovery of Style,' which is a magnificent theater
manual by Michel St. Denis, who directed Laurence Olivier and John
Gielgud. He initiated the Old Vic school and then eventually the
Juilliard School in New York."</TE>
<TE>   St. Denis' book, familiar to many classically trained theater
artists, argues that period style is more than surface behavior.
"Most people have an idea that style is something quite superficial,
that it's a way that people behave," Bedford says. "Michel saw style
as being something much deeper and much more essential, to do with
creating the reality of the people within these plays, not just as a
superficial bowing and use of handkerchiefs."</TE>
<TE>   A balance must be struck between the writer's vision and modern
sensibilities. "We are trying our very best to fulfill what we
perceive as Moliere's intentions, but we can only get at it through
our own time, because our style is not the style of the Moliere play,
and style does exist in modern plays too," explains Bedford.</TE>
<TE>   Manners and mores and historically accurate curtsies may be
important, but they should not be thought of as separable from the
characters' psychology. "The truth of working on any classic is that
the psychology of a human is constant," says Art Manke, who is
coaching the period movement and choreographing a dance for "The
Moliere Comedies."</TE>
<TE>   A founder and former co-artistic director of the classical company
A Noise Within, Manke directed a number of Moliere works for the
Glendale troupe, where he continues to serve as a resident director.
"Where people sometimes trip up is they focus so much on the form
that then they somehow miss the content and the core of the work."</TE>
<TE>   Still, how the psychology is interpreted is subject to one's own
worldview. "I'm interested in trying to penetrate to a play's inner
concerns, but I know that that is subjective by who I am and the time
I live in," says Chambers, who directed "The School for Wives" at
South Coast Repertory. "I don't think the classics are necessarily
universal or modern, but I do think a good text will stretch to
contemporary concerns."</TE>
<TE>   Contemporary indeed. In "The School for Husbands," an older man
zealously guards the much younger woman he wants to keep as his own,
sequestering her from the rest of society, lest her affections land
elsewhere. In "The Imaginary Cuckold," a husband thinks his wife is
cheating on him with a younger man.</TE>
<TE>   The plots and protagonists would seem to be perennial. "The
leading characters in Moliere are immensely complicated, usually
neurotic, self-involved people who, in the case of 'The School for
Husbands,' are so insecure themselves that they think the way to a
relationship with another human being is to control them," Bedford
says.</TE>
<TE>   "Moliere, like Chekhov, found unhappy, neurotic people funny, and
it's particularly surprising with him, because we gather that he was
somewhat like that himself. In 'School for Wives' and 'The School for
Husbands,' for instance, you have men whose aim is to have a very
young, very ignorant, beautiful girl as their wife. Moliere also
married a very young girl."</TE>
<TE>   But Moliere goes beyond the easy laugh. "The protagonist of 'The
School for Husbands' is an incredibly complicated guy, and you want
the text to be excavated psychologically so that you have the
different levels of this," Bedford says.</TE>
<TE>   One of the greatest barriers to bringing classics to today's
audiences is the text. Moliere--and particularly his rhymed
verse--has long been considered tough to translate for American
audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Wilbur's translations, however, are often regarded as the
benchmark when it comes to accessibility. "I try to avoid perishable
slang and to keep it in contemporary language but without writing an
updated version," says Wilbur, speaking by phone from his home in
Florida. "Fortunately, Moliere's style is a frank conversational
style, and one can take him over into English without a lot of
adjustment.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be attuned to the sensibility as well as responsible
to the dictionary sense of his words. I think the reason why Moliere
works is that his language is so plain and natural, even when he's
giving you jokes between aristocrats."</TE>
<TE>   One reason fluid translation is pivotal is that times have
changed. "Articulating long, complex thoughts through language is
something we are no longer as skilled at because we've turned into a
much more visual society," Manke says.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a piece like the Moliere, the challenge is hooking
the audience into listening more to the language," he adds. "The way
to do that is focusing on the truth of the human relationships, and
that is what will connect us to it."</TE>
<TE>   In the case of "The Moliere Comedies," there is also the matter of
rhyme. Today's audiences may not be accustomed to hearing it, but
they are certainly capable of enjoying it. "We forget that one of our
earliest experiences is nursery rhymes," Manke says. If the
translator wields power in terms of the language, the director and
designers have a similar power in the physical production. Most
obviously, there is the decision of whether or not to update the
setting.</TE>
<TE>   Wilbur finds most updating unnecessary. "Moliere is a good deal
less problematical than other playwrights," he says. "If one
translates him into an equivalent simple and open language, he comes
across without much mediation or adjustment to contemporary
audiences. That's why I think there's never any need to update a
play, to put it in modern dress or locate it in North Carolina. It
usually turns out to be an adjustment that doesn't need to be made.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying that one must perfectly imitate the
costumes--anything roughly 17th century will do," Wilbur says. "But
we get some kind of patronizing distortion if a director puts his
mark on it by modernizing or moving it. I don't think that injected
references to President Bush or Saks Fifth Avenue help."</TE>
<TE>   Such interpolations may cover up for the lack of a deeper
understanding of the play. These classical plays demand tremendous
skill, Bedford says. "But the theater is such a ragbag that we get
the most awful departures from professionalism," he says, "and what
happens is that people who don't know how to get to the heart of
these plays just think, 'Oh, we'll do something tremendously original
by the way they look.'"</TE>
<TE>   However, not everyone who updates a play does so capriciously.
Many respected theater artists believe that resetting a period comedy
or drama in a different place and time is a highly effective and
efficient way to make it accessible.</TE>
<TE>   Chambers, for instance, has reset many classics, including his
fourth and most recent Moliere at South Coast Rep, in a translation
by Ranjit Bolt. "Any reading is greatly influenced by one's own time
and sense of history, so any reading is a contemporary reading," he
says. "What I'm always interested in doing is locating it somewhere
and somehow that is analogous and accessible, but which still has a
poetic layer of distance on it."</TE>
<TE>   The key to a successful transposition, in Chambers' view, is to
find a backdrop that brings out the play's principal concerns. "With
17th century France, many of the external codes are very distant from
our experience," he says. "There are ways Moliere translates
directly, but I find that certain audiences are at times simply
removed from the experience by the sight of a certain style of
costume, setting and performance."</TE>
<TE>   Even Bedford, who's not generally an advocate of resetting,
acknowledges that almost anything goes, as long as you do your
homework. "My belief is you can do anything with these plays," he
says. "You can set them on the moon, in the future, in the present or
wherever you want, just so long as you excavate appropriately that
text.</TE>
<TE>   "I have such a passionate love of these texts," Bedford continues.
"The only way that these plays come to the kind of life that I admire
is in a very lively, dazzling way which is based on reality."</TE>

<HD>Fragile Work, Fragile Life</HD>
<DH>Just as she knew she hadn't long to live, Eva Hesse knew
her works using unstable materials might not last. A show confronts
the issue in an overview of her brief career.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Life doesn't last," Eva Hesse told an interviewer toward the end of
her brief life. "Art doesn't last. It doesn't matter."</LD>
<LD>   That was 1970, and Hesse was only 34 years old. She had been
working as an artist for a decade and was finally beginning to hit
her stride. An innovator influenced by Minimalism, Surrealism and
Conceptualism, she became known for her sculpture, molding latex into
drapery-like sheets and three-dimensional shapes, dipping
aluminum-screen armatures into fiberglass resin, pioneering new
materials and processes in a search for "non-art" art.</LD>
<LD>   Hesse had reason for her fatalism. It was part artistic stance and
part unflinching personal honesty. She knew that at least some of the
innovative materials she used would have a limited shelf life, but
she still prized her experiments. "At this point," she told the
interviewer, "I feel a little guilty about when people want to buy
it.... [But] if I need [latex] ... that is more important."</LD>
<TE>   She was also seriously ill, undergoing treatment for a brain
tumor.</TE>
<TE>   Within months, Hesse died. But her work, and her legacy, would
live on.</TE>
<TE>   She would be lionized by women artists and feminist art
historians. Her drawings and sculptures would continue to appear in
galleries and museumsin the U.S. and Europe. A major 1992
retrospective at Yale University, her alma mater, would solidify her
influence. And throughout the '90s, the price of her artworks would
steadily rise. In 1997, the San Francisco Museum of Art would pay
$2.2 million for "Untitled or Not Yet."</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 2, "Eva Hesse," the most comprehensive retrospective of
her work yet, opened at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
Organized by Elisabeth Sussman, former curator at the Whitney Museum
of American Art in New York, and Renate Petzinger, of the Museum
Wiesbaden in Germany, the show includes some 150 works borrowed from
more than two dozen lenders. The curators have paid particular
attention to combining her early works with her late, experimental
works, which proved to be a substantial challenge. As Hesse
predicted, some of the later works have disintegrated; many are
fragile in the extreme.</TE>
<TE>   For Sussman, however, seeing the breadth of the work is crucial to
the mission of the exhibition, which is meant to yield a balanced
picture of Hesse as an artist. "I wanted to look closely at work,
process, evolution, [not] her anxieties, traumas, etc.," Sussman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn Zelevansky, head of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's
department of modern and contemporary art, is a champion of the San
Francisco exhibition: It's "one of the most important shows I can
imagine presenting," she says, "and probably the last opportunity to
see her works in a comprehensive way. These pieces are so fragile and
so highly valued that this is probably it."</TE>
<TE>   The SF MOMA exhibition fills the fourth floor of the museum, the
works displayed against subdued background colors. Arranged
chronologically, it opens with drawings and washes on paper. On a
walk-through, Sussman points out that Helen Hesse Charash, Eva's
sister, believes that two of the ink paintings are
self-portraits--one could be seen as a family grouping of four
(mother, father, the two sisters) and one a lone figure, with no
details of face or dress.</TE>
<TE>   The works are from 1960. "It's the same time she's in
psychotherapy," Sussman says, "and she's really working through her
very loaded past."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Hamburg, Germany, in 1936, to an Orthodox Jewish family,
Hesse was separated from her parents for several months when she was
sent away to Holland at age 2. Her parents, seeing the Nazi threat,
eventually collected their two daughters and emigrated to the United
States in 1939. Six years later, her parents divorced, and a year
after that, her mother committed suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Sussman finds elements in the monochromatic paintings that
foreshadow Hesse's later work. "These are very prophetic," she says,
"because they have no color and the washes are very layered--which is
like the [latex] work later on--and then they have these figurative
elements which become very abstract."</TE>
<TE>   In 1964, European arts patron F. Arnhard Scheidt offered Hesse's
husband, Tom Doyle, a sculptor, a year of studio space in an old
textile mill in Kettwig-am-Ruhr, Germany. Hesse went along and set up
her own work space. She began a series of  diagrammatic line drawings
that were "hybrids of body parts and machines," as Sussman writes in
her essay in the exhibition catalog. Then, apparently at Doyle's
urging, she began to use industrial materials found in the building
to make her first break from flat surfaces.</TE>
<TE>   "There were miles of that string there," he told art historian
Lucy Lippard. "The string was really what got her going."</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 4, 1964, Hesse wrote in her journal: "Started sculpture,
lead wire through a huge screen. Shortage of wire forced change to
plaster."</TE>
<TE>   That piece is lost, but 14 other assemblages made during this
breakthrough period remain--they were shown at Dusseldorf Kunsthalle
in August 1995--and 11 of them have been reunited for the San
Francisco show.</TE>
<TE>   Working on Masonite, Hesse built up surfaces with papier-mache and
other materials, attached found objects (wires and a light socket,
for example), then painted the results. Many of these works use rope
or cord, which would become an enduring Hesse fascination. She
sometimes glued it into rows or circles ("Ringaround Arosie," "2 in
1"), wound it around protruding rods ("Oomamaboomba") or just let it
dangle ("An Ear in a Pond"). Many observers have noted sexual imagery
in these works--"Ringaround Arosie," in which wound cord makes two
circles, could be interpreted as breasts, with the "nipple" of one
painted pink.</TE>
<TE>   Hesse's diaries reveal her excitement about her work and her
increasing unhappiness in her personal life. She resented living in
Doyle's shadow, and doing double duty as artist and housekeeper, when
he could focus only on his art. In January 1964, she wrote, "I cannot
be so many things. I cannot be something for everyone.... Woman,
beautiful, artist, wife, housekeeper, cook, saleslady all these
things. I cannot even be myself, nor know what I am."</TE>
<TE>   When Hesse returned to New York at the end of 1965, her marriage
collapsed. Amid the upheaval, she began to make free-standing
sculpture, building on the work begun in Germany. She experimented
with liquid latex and fiberglass--making process and chance important
elements in her work, casting or pouring the materials, or dipping
things into them.  This was when, wrote Michael Kimmelman of the New
York Times in 1992, she began "to invent sculptures of real
originality and distinction."</TE>
<TE>   In November 1968, Hesse's first one-woman sculpture show, at the
Fischback Gallery in New York, included pieces that would become
classics in her oeuvre, including "Accession II" (a steel cube
pierced with short lengths of plastic tubing), "Sans II" (a grid of
box-like shapes made of membrane-like fiberglass), "Aught"
(latex-coated panels) and its companion, "Augment" (sheets of latex
stacked on the floor). All except the last are in the San Francisco
exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   The critics were impressed but mystified. "Her works are questions
rather than answers," the Village Voice wrote. "They are bundles of
eccentric contradictions.... Eva Hesse is an important new artist."</TE>
<TE>   Two months before the show, Hesse complained of depression and
exhaustion. In April 1969, she collapsed. When a brain tumor was
discovered, she had a series of operations and radiation and
chemotherapy, but she continued working. In the last years of her
life, her work was included in major museum shows at the Institute of
Contemporary Art in Philadelphia and New York's Museum of Modern Art,
and both MOMA and the Whitney purchased works.</TE>
<TE>   When Sussman went to work at the Whitney in 1991, she was already
aware of Hesse. A year later she saw the Yale retrospective and
decided to begin her own research on the artist and create an even
more comprehensive exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized that they had avoided these radical [latex] pieces
that she did at the end of her life," Sussman says. "These are so
hard to show because they're in such bad shape. I decided that this
show had to take on that issue."</TE>
<TE>   Sussman later joined forces with curator Petzinger, who was
planning a Hesse show for the Museum Weisbaden. After San Francisco,
where it runs through May 19, the exhibition will open in Germany in
June. It was scheduled to open at the Whitney in November, but after
Sept. 11, the Whitney canceled because of financial problems.
Instead, at the end of this year, the show will move to Tate Modern
in London.</TE>
<TE>   By including Hesse's lesser known pre-1965 works on paper and
canvas with the more famous later works, the curators want to show
the preliminaries in her rapidly evolving career. The mid-career
works reveal how Hesse began to break out of the frame--and, in fact,
"Hang Up" (1966) literally shows just that, with a long, loopy cable
distended from two parts of an oversized frame.</TE>
<TE>   Many signature pieces are included. There are the translucent
cylindrical shapes of "Repetition Nineteen III" as well as the series
of open fiberglass boxes mounted on the wall in "Sans II"--the five
sections, each six boxes wide, are joined here, although they are
from four collections. SF MOMA owns one unit.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most fragile works in the exhibition is "Aught," now
owned by the Art Museum at UC Berkeley. "It was fortuitous that it
was just across the bridge," Sussman says. "[Berkeley museum
officials] knew they could watch it, that if anything started
happening, we would take it down--it's all written into the loan
agreement." "Aught" will not travel beyond San Francisco. Each
6-foot-high piece is made of a sheet of cloth or plastic sandwiched
between layers of latex. Hung from grommets in the upper corners,
they were allowed to sag and fold according to gravitational pull.
Today, they are in danger of cracking and breaking; to prevent
tearing, back edges of the work have been reinforced.</TE>
<TE>   To deal with conservation challenges such as "Aught," Sussman and
SF MOMA organized a round-table talk for 21 curators, conservators
and Hesse experts. Latex was the focus of much of the
discussion--which is excerpted in the exhibition catalog--because it
hardens and softens in ways that are beyond control.</TE>
<TE>   "We've found out that latex is a kind of alive thing," Sussman
says. "[One moment] it's in a dormant period, then all of a sudden it
starts to ooze." There are other works Sussman sought unsuccessfully.
A test piece for a hanging sheet of latex called "Contingent," owned
by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., was among them.
Jay Krueger, National Gallery conservator, told the round table, "We
said no for the reason that we felt it could not be safely packed and
transported without incurring damage."</TE>
<TE>   Sussman's view is that with care, the works should have a public
viewing. "We were told by one latex expert that these things will
deteriorate whether they're in storage or being shown--so why not let
everyone have a chance to see them?"</TE>
<TE>   When the Whitney Museum decided at the end of last year that it
didn't have the funds to bring the Hesse show to New York City, it
stirred the outrage of many in the art world.</TE>
<TE>   "[The Whitney's] refusal to do what's necessary to bring the show
to New York is an abject and utterly unforgivable failure of both
museum leadership and artistic vision," says Tony Ganz, a Los Angeles
film producer and collector who loaned six works to the show. His
parents, Victor and Sally Ganz, began acquiring Hesse's work in the
'60s. "It seems to me Eva Hesse was as great an artist as New York
has ever produced." What makes him so impassioned about the work?</TE>
<TE>   "The sculpture in particular contains within it this marvelous
tension--order and luminosity on one hand, chaos and decay on the
other. She had such perfect pitch as an artist."</TE>
<TE>   Hesse might have liked the sentiment. She once said, "I would try
to find the most absurd opposites or extreme opposites...."</TE>
<TE>   In her art and in her life, she acknowledged contradiction and
embraced change: "There isn't a rule. I don't want to keep any rules.
That's why my art might be so good, because I have no fear."</TE>

<HD>A Plucky Carnation From Pink</HD>

<LD>Everything about Pink and her 2000 debut album, "Can't Take Me Home,"
smacked of calculation: the name, the matching hair color, the music.
But the 22-year-old singer undergoes a delightful transformation in
her sophomore collection, which brightens this edition of Calendar's
guide to keeping up on what's noteworthy (and fun, we should add) in
pop on an album budget of $50 a month.</LD>
<LD>   January</LD>
<LD>   Pink's "Missundaztood" (Arista). MTV has helped make countless
stars, but usually by playing their videos. What caught my eye in
Pink's case was her interview of the "Ocean's Eleven" cast in a
channel special. She exhibited so much personality that the actors
seemed like amateurs at the media game. This album also shows that
Pink is more than a marketing and studio creation. Rather than pursue
the teen pop/R&amp;B direction of the debut, she teams with former 4 Non
Blondes leader Linda Perry to write songs with rock-edged intensity
and individuality, while the hit single "Get the Party Started" shows
she can still compete in the youthful, mainstream radio field with
winning flair.</LD>
<TE>   Kasey Chambers' "Barricades &amp; Brickwalls" (Warner Bros.). Here's
another young singer-songwriter who steps up dramatically in her
second album. When Chambers arrived from Australia last year, she
showed a winning affection for the kind of American country music
that both salutes and challenges country tradition, in the manner of
Emmylou Harris and Lucinda Williams. There were moments in "The
Captain" with some of the emotional power of those artists, but too
much of that debut seemed second-hand. This time, Chambers digs deep
inside to tap into feelings that are more convincing and revealing.
Framing the music with rock and blues urgency, she is sometimes
vulnerable, sometimes defiant. She'll be at the Roxy on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Coup's "Party Music" (75 Art/Tommy Boy). For all its early
revolutionary spirit, rap during the last half-dozen years has become
as predictable and bland as the rest of mainstream pop--at least if
you just listen to best-sellers. But there's an imaginative layer of
alt-rap that is as worthy of attention and respect as the best of
alt-rock and alt-country, and nothing underscores the point more than
this Oakland entry. Boots Riley's politically charged tales of social
oppression remind you of Public Enemy's commentaries, and the beats
are frequently explosive. Riley's language is rough in spots, but the
dialogue is important. In the potent opening track, "Everythang," he
declares, "Every little cent to the rent/Every roach is a
resident/Every truth ain't evident/Every slave story is present
tense/Every uprise a consequence."</TE>
<TE>   February</TE>
<TE>   JJ72's "JJ72" (Lakota/Columbia). Mark Greaney, the leader of this
promising young Dublin trio, can hook you with the wonder and mystery
of his high, searching vocals, and the music mixes many rich pop-rock
elements--from slices of feedback to lush strings--in ways that will
remind you of everything from the Velvet Underground to the Stone
Roses. Much like the latter's debut album, you feel in the best
moments that here is a new generation announcing its arrival. In
"Willow," the band even declares, "We are new now."</TE>
<TE>   Buddy &amp; Julie Miller's "Buddy &amp; Julie Miller" (Hightone). Because
labels are slow to release product in the new year, the Guide gives
us a chance to pick up on some 2001 releases--like this one--that
deserve continuing attention. The alt-country husband-and-wife team
shows you how they can bring life to what once seemed like a Bob
Dylan throwaway ("Wallflower"), but they mostly dazzle you with the
vitality and depth of original songs, including "You Make My Heart
Beat Too Fast" and "That's Just How She Cries," that speak about
romance in both its glorious and dark moments. They're at the Roxy on
Feb. 25.</TE>
<TE>   Jaguar Wright's "Denials, Delusions and Decisions" (MCA). A
graduate of the same Philadelphia scene that also played a role in
the launching of Jill Scott and India.Arie, Wright comes to a crowded
female neo-soul movement a little late. But she's got the authority
and dynamics, as a singer and writer, in this debut to force everyone
to move over and make room. She can be as outspoken as Millie
Jackson, then be equally enticing on a straightforward ballad.</TE>

<HD>The Not-So-Big Hit Single</HD>
<DH>Thanks to fractured radio formats and the changing record
industry, No. 1 no longer means a song is heard by most of the
nation.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't cry for Mariah Carey.</LD>
<LD>   The pop diva might have been rudely dumped by Virgin Records, but
she walks away with almost as much money ($49 million) as some of
those Enron executives.</LD>
<LD>   And everyone knows rival labels are lining up to sign the Long
Island native with a low-ball offer, knowing that she needs
desperately to reestablish herself after her recent album and movie
flops. Billy Crystal scored one of the biggest laughs of 2001 when he
used "Glitter" as the butt of a joke during "The Concert for New York
City," the Sept. 11-related benefit concert.</LD>
<TE>   Setting everyone up by suggesting the country needs to pull
together, Crystal said, "Whether we are Christians or Jews or
Muslims, we all have to agree on one thing ... we can never, ever
again let Mariah Carey make another movie."</TE>
<TE>   Truthfully, Crystal would have been just as on target by saying,
"We can never, ever again let Mariah Carey put together another
tour."</TE>
<TE>   How bad was the movie "Glitter," which cast her in the apparently
too challenging role of a pop diva?</TE>
<TE>   I didn't see "Glitter," and judging from the box office receipts,
neither did you. But I did see Carey's concert at Staples Center in
the spring of 2000, and it was the most vacuous show by a major
pop-music figure I've ever attended. You'll see more imaginative
staging concepts at middle-school talent shows.</TE>
<TE>   The bad movie and the bad tour are no surprise.</TE>
<TE>   For all her record sales, Carey has never been a very satisfying
artist. Carey is blessed with one of the great voices in modern pop,
with a range that stretches across octaves, but she has shown little
imagination in the use of it.</TE>
<TE>   The only reason record companies are interested in her is that she
has sold more than 40 million albums in the U.S., but those sales
figures shouldn't be used to persuade us that she's a visionary
talent, as some of her supporters try to do.</TE>
<TE>   Their favorite figure is that she has more No. 1 singles (15) than
anyone since the Beatles (20) and Elvis Presley (18).</TE>
<TE>   On the list of meaningless pop statistics, that's No. 1 with a
bullet.</TE>
<TE>   Carey has mastered the art of the No. 1 record in an anonymous pop
age--one in which No. 1 records carry only a fraction of the musical
character and cultural impact that they did in earlier decades.</TE>
<TE>   Her fans make much of the fact that Carey's teaming with Boyz II
Men on "One Sweet Day" in 1995 spent more weeks at No. 1 (16) than
any other record in the '90s.</TE>
<TE>   They might not be so quick to suggest that's a sign of excellence
if they realized what record had the second-longest run at No. 1 in
the '90s: Los Del Rio's "Macarena."</TE>
<TE>   One way to put the cultural importance of a No. 1 single these
days into perspective is to realize that Elvis and the Beatles aren't
the leaders in that category. Bing Crosby, the crooner who topped the
charts in the '30s and '40s, had nearly as many No. 1 pop singles
than those two combined: 36.</TE>
<TE>   The reason Crosby's figures aren't counted by record chart
researchers today is because he recorded in a different era--and the
cultural impact of being No. 1 was different.</TE>
<TE>   The "modern" pop era began with the birth of rock 'n' roll in the
mid-'50s, and all statistics today pretty much reflect what has
happened since then. But one could argue that another dividing line
needs to be drawn in terms of pop charts. Conditions in the record
business are as different now from the days of Presley and the
Beatles as their day was from Crosby's.</TE>
<TE>   Comparing statistics from the different eras is as tricky as
trying to compare Babe Ruth's and Barry Bonds' home run marks.</TE>
<TE>   During the rock 'n' roll revolution in the '50s, singles were the
main focus of teenage record buyers. They were more affordable--you
could buy four or five singles for the price of an album--and it was
a lot more fun having all those 45s than an album that might have one
hit song and a lot of filler.</TE>
<TE>   The prominence of albums didn't begin in earnest until the arrival
of Bob Dylan and the Beatles in the '60s, when fans started having
faith in the artist's ability to deliver an entire album of good
work. From that time on, the primary purpose of singles has been to
sell albums by exposing the music on radio. The Beatles felt so
confident about their music and their popularity by 1967 that they
didn't ever release a U.S. single from "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts
Club Band."</TE>
<TE>   Another change has been radio formats. In the early days of rock,
most young music fans listened to Top 40 radio stations that played a
broad range of music, picking the strongest cuts from rock and
country, R&amp;B and pop. That meant you could hear Presley, Aretha
Franklin, Marvin Gaye and Frank Sinatra on the same station. Because
the stations appealed to such a broad range of fans, it was possible
to build a national consensus when it came to No. 1 records. Who
alive in 1956 didn't hear "Don't Be Cruel" or "I Want to Hold Your
Hand" in 1964 or "Hey Jude" in 1968?</TE>
<TE>   Today, radio formats have been broken into narrow
categories--country, urban, adult contemporary, alt/college rock,
modern rock, classic rock and so on. As a result, we don't all hear
the same music anymore.</TE>
<TE>   There are still mainstream pop stations, but they don't show
nearly the same openness to a broad range of sounds that their
forerunners did. Country and hard rock, for instance, are not
generally welcome on these mainstream formats. There are many No. 1
records each week, one in each format. But there is no longer that
consensus choice for a No. 1 hit that everyone celebrates.</TE>
<TE>   The result: Singles can become No. 1 some weeks by selling as few
as 15,000 copies.</TE>
<TE>   Records are ranked on the charts not just by sales, but also by
the amount of radio airplay they receive--and record companies spend
a fortune trying to influence stations to play their releases.</TE>
<TE>   Between promotional pressure and stations' desperation to hook
listeners, the last factor considered is whether the record is any
good. You get an idea of how flimsy a No.1 single can be when you
realize Paula Abdul and Milli Vanilli had nine No.1 singles between
them between 1988 and 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Some great records have reached No. 1 in recent years, including
Toni Braxton's "Un-Break My Heart," TLC's "Waterfalls" and Sinead
O'Connor's "Nothing Compares 2 U."</TE>
<TE>   Most No. 1 singles, however, have gotten there because they are
anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   Can you even name the performers of these '90s No. 1 hits? "I'll
Be Your Everything" (No. 1 for one week in 1990), "Love Takes Time"
(two weeks in 1990), "The First Time" (two weeks in 1991), "Here
Comes the Hotstepper" (two weeks in 1994), "Always Be My Baby" (two
weeks in 1996) and "Too Close" (five weeks in 1998).</TE>
<TE>   One hint: two of them were by Carey.</TE>
<TE>   Good luck.</TE>

<HD>A Passion for Blues and Filmmaking</HD>
<DH>Director Wim Wenders focuses his segment on three of his
heroes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bonnie Raitt and her band are on stage at the Knitting Factory club
in Hollywood, performing "Round and Round," a song originated by late
blues musician J.B. Lenoir.</LD>
<LD>   "Round and round and up and down ... round and round and up and
down," they sing in a subdued, ghostly manner, ultimately fading into
eerie silence.</LD>
<LD>   There was little audience response, because there was little
audience; only a few people were in the room. But perched on a ladder
in front of the stage, a man in black slacks, white shirt and glasses
with thick black rims speaks up.</LD>
<TE>   "Can't I have a microphone too?" he asks, a boyish grin on his
face. The man who wants to sing along is Wim Wenders, the prolific
German director of such richly emotional and intellectually
challenging films as "Paris, Texas" and "Wings of Desire" as well as
the 1998 Oscar-nominated documentary "Buena Vista Social Club," which
followed veteran Cuban musicians to newfound fame.</TE>
<TE>   Up on the ladder, digital video camera in hand rather than
microphone, Wenders is shooting the performance in his role as one of
six directors making segments of "The Blues," the ambitious series
scheduled for airing on PBS in fall 2003.</TE>
<TE>   For his film, which also includes location shooting in
Mississippi, Wenders is focusing on three of his personal blues
heroes: the relatively obscure '50s Chicago figure Lenoir; Delta
blues pioneer Skip James, who disavowed the music in the early '30s
and turned to preaching, only to be rediscovered by blues researchers
in 1964; and '20s and '30s gruff-voiced gospel-blues titan Blind
Willie Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   That Wenders is having trouble keeping the line between his task
as a documentarian and his passion as a fan is fine by series
producer Alex Gibney, pleased as he watches the day's sessions.</TE>
<TE>   "These [the directors] are people who were musicians themselves or
have a deep affinity for music," Gibney says. "Go to Wim's Web site
and you'll see: He's about music." Wenders' films have often had a
strong musical element, whether Ry Cooder's haunting, influential
score for "Paris, Texas" or the contributions of such regular
collaborators as U2 and Lou Reed to distinctive soundtracks accenting
the melancholy but restless spirits inhabiting the stories.</TE>
<TE>   That passion is clear a few minutes later. While the stage is
being reset for a Raitt solo performance of James' spooky "Devil Got
My Woman," Wenders stands with her on the club floor, begging for
stories about James, whom Raitt as a 19-year-old tyro performer
befriended in the year before his 1969 death.</TE>
<TE>   "I never got to hear him play," says Raitt, trying to discount the
value of any anecdotes she might have. "He was too sick by the time I
met him. But the first time I ever played his songs, I was playing
them to him in his bedroom when he had stomach cancer."</TE>
<TE>   This direct connection to the source of music that's inspired him
since his youth is why he jumped right in when executive producer
Martin Scorsese invited him into the project two years ago, bringing
in Wenders' Road Movies company as European co-production partner.
"He didn't have to twist my arm," Wenders, 55, said. "I love the
blues. I have a huge collection of blues records and CDs."</TE>
<TE>   The first authentic blues in the collection date to Wenders' days
in late-'60s Germany, when he heard English blues guru John Mayall's
"The Death of J.B. Lenoir."</TE>
<TE>   "I bought John Mayall's 'Crusade' album when it came out, in 1968,
I think," says the director. "I heard his tribute to J.B. Lenoir and
the immediacy of it, the honesty of his complaint and the truth and
beauty of that song made me go out immediately and try to find a
record by that man himself. It wasn't easy. J.B. was pretty obsolete
by then."</TE>
<TE>   He was able to track down one album, "Alabama Blues," which
showcased the Southern-born musician in an acoustic country blues
setting with just his own guitar and a drummer for accompaniment
rather than the raw-edged electric style he became best known for in
the '50s Chicago scene.</TE>
<TE>   "I was mesmerized," Wenders says. "I'd never heard anything
remotely like it, neither in terms of his lyrics--some of them with
outspoken political messages, some deeply religious songs--nor his
sometimes desperate, sometimes ironic yet always confident tone." A
similar epiphany struck in the late '70s, when clerks in a San
Francisco record store persuaded him to buy an album by James, whose
haunted tone in such landmark songs as "Hard Time Killing Floor" and
"I'm So Glad" influenced icons from Robert Johnson to Eric Clapton.</TE>
<TE>   "The effect was the same as with J.B.," he says. "I couldn't
believe that this man wasn't known among my friends, that nobody ever
heard of him.... When I first heard his voice, I was just deeply
moved." And it happened again nearly a decade later with the music of
Blind Willie Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "Together with Ry Cooder, we picked Blind Willie's incredible
rendition of 'Dark Was the Night' as the leitmotif for the score of
'Paris, Texas,'" he says.</TE>
<TE>   These are not only the wellsprings of the director's relationship
with blues music but the starting points for his film in progress.
The project is described as "part pilgrimage" because, along with
historical footage, reenactments and current artists including Raitt,
Los Lobos, Lou Reed and Lucinda Williams bringing the music to life,
it involves Wenders on a quest to understand the driving forces
behind the mystical music.</TE>
<TE>   "To tell you the truth, I am not sure yet how my film will bring
out that struggle between the sacred and the profane," Wenders says.
"The gap between the very down-to-earth themes of the blues--women,
trouble, poverty, oppression, drinking and so on--and its religious
applications, expressed very often with entirely the same means, is a
conflict and struggle that many musicians dealt with on an everyday
basis."</TE>
<TE>   "Wenders' quest gets approval from Raitt, a founder of the Rhythm
and Blues Foundation and a fierce fighter to recover blues musicians'
long-denied performance and songwriting royalties as well as to
protect their legacies.</TE>
<TE>   "When Wim and I first met today, he was talking about old footage
he's uncovered, people he's interviewed," she says after her
performances for the film. "I could tell from that there was a good
reason he had picked these important but often underground bluesmen
[as his subjects]. I could tell he had a soulful approach."</TE>
<TE>   After a break at the Knitting Factory, Wenders is wielding his
hand-held digital camera again, this time on stage as Los Lobos plays
a rough, rollicking rendition of Lenoir's "Voodoo Music." He's
rushing from musician to musician, getting close-ups of expressive
faces, fingers on guitar fret boards, feet tapping the rhythm. It's
easy to see he's having the time of his life, even if he doesn't get
to sing along. Later, he says, "I could have gone on filming them for
days."</TE>

<HD>On Their Own, Together</HD>
<DH>As Asian Americans, the Bascos often try out for the same
few roles. So they created their own parts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLARE KLEINEDLER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dion Basco is talking about his latest audition for a TV series. It
was uneventful and much like most other auditions he's experienced in
the past 10 years. Even as he speaks of running into his older
brother, Derek, at the casting studio, he doesn't blink an eye. By
now, he's accustomed to competing against hundreds of other
actors--and his three brothers: "Yeah, we were both at the audition,
no big deal," he says.</LD>
<LD>   "What audition?" yells brother Dante, slamming his fist down on
their dining room table. For a moment, the three siblings, plus a
fourth, Darion, sit stone silent. Within seconds, they burst into
laughter.</LD>
<LD>   "This is our life, right here," Dante says.</LD>
<TE>   Because of the scarcity of major roles available to Asian
Americans in Hollywood, the four Filipino American brothers regularly
compete against each other. During auditions for the 1996 film "Race
the Sun," the now-30-year-old Derek read for a supporting part.
Casting directors liked what they saw, but asked if he had a younger
brother. So, Darion, now 26, read for the part. He was told to call
his younger brother, Dante, now 25. When Dante read, again the
casting people wanted someone a little younger.</TE>
<TE>   Dion, who is 24, landed the role: "Actually, the way I remember
it, I just went in there and blew them away," jokes Dion.</TE>
<TE>   Only 2.6% of all roles in Hollywood went to Asian Americans in
2000, according to the Screen Actors Guild. Even more frustrating for
those actors is that many of the roles written for Asian men tend to
be in the category of martial arts fighters, gang members or socially
inept, calculator-toting nerds. The Basco brothers are all
good-looking, appealing men. With dark skin, chiseled facial features
and thick, black hair, they don't fit into the geek category.</TE>
<TE>   "To tell you the truth, we don't get cast in many of those
stereotypical Asian roles because we walk into a room and the casting
director will say, 'Whoa, this is too much for an Asian guy role;
you're not supposed to be turned on by an Asian guy,'" Darion says.</TE>
<TE>   "And if they do take the risk and cast us into those roles,
suddenly the role is something totally different. So we can keep our
integrity that way as artists."</TE>
<TE>   The brothers have appeared in several major film and television
productions. Dante has worked more than the others, probably because
he scored the role of Rufio in Steven Spielberg's "Hook" (1991) when
he was just 15. He's also had lead roles in films such as "Extreme
Days" (2001) and "But I'm a Cheerleader" (2000). Still, Derek
appeared last season as Jack's flavor-of-the-week, Mipanko, in a
"Will &amp; Grace" episode and had a recurring role on "Becker." Dion
just came off a five-year run as a regular on the NBC
Saturday-morning comedy "City Guys."</TE>
<TE>   Darion also has had his fair share of work, including the indie
film "Hundred Percent" (1998), and roles on "ER" and "Chicago Hope."
Their work has attracted the attention of some Hollywood executives,
including Quan Phung, director of comedy development for Fox
Broadcasting Co.</TE>
<TE>   "Dante's known in the independent film world. Dion and Derek have
gotten kudos for their comedic work. And Darion's doing great
dramatic pieces. They are still young, but I can imagine a scenario
where their careers develop in the same way the Wayans brothers'
careers developed, where they can succeed individually or working
with each other," Phung says.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the brothers acted together for the first time in "The
Debut," a coming-of-age comedy about a young Filipino American boy
coming to terms with his cultural identity.</TE>
<TE>   The movie, directed by first-timer Gene Cajayon, was marketed to
an Asian American audience. Although the Basco brothers cite their
performances in "The Debut" as some of their best work, they were
disappointed that the film, which was shown at a couple of festivals
and in rented theaters, didn't gain theatrical distribution to a
broader audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, we are the actors in the film, not the director or
producer, so it wasn't really up to us on how to best release the
film," Derek says, "but we learned a lot and now we can apply those
lessons to our own project."</TE>
<TE>   For the past several months, the Bascos have been working on their
first feature film as a group, "Naked Brown Men," written by Derek
and fellow actor Adam G. Adam, who is half Jamaican, half white, grew
up with the brothers, and is often called the fifth Basco by family
and friends.</TE>
<TE>   The group hired director Bob Bryan, best known for his documentary
series "Graffiti Verite," and spent 30 days filming "Naked Brown Men"
in the Laurel Canyon home shared by Dion, Dante, Darion and Adam.</TE>
<TE>   The film blurs the line between fact and fiction. The story is
about four actor brothers who compete for the same roles and
sometimes the same women. Although it is a comedy, the script delves
into issues the brothers have had with one another for many years but
have rarely, if ever, talked about. Many scenes proved difficult,
especially for Darion and Dante, who are the two closest in age and
the most competitive in real life. Some days, according to Darion,
were emotionally and physically draining.</TE>
<TE>   "On the last day of rehearsal, Dante and I had to confront each
other on something that we've never talked about. I can't say what it
is because it would give away the scene in the movie. We both got
sick, we threw up after that, and we were both a little sick during
the whole shooting of the movie," Darion says.</TE>
<TE>   A story that has become family folklore is one of Dante and Darion
as children, battling over a trophy in karate class.</TE>
<TE>   Although the master asked that one bow out to avoid two brothers
fighting, they insisted on competing. The match was close until the
end, when Darion jumped up and kicked his brother in the face,
knocking him to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Darion thought this meant a win, but the instructor disqualified
him and Dante won the prize.</TE>
<TE>   "To this day, Darion thinks he won and so does Dante," says
director Bryan. "It's an old story now and they love each other no
doubt, but there is a lot of jealousy over that love that was
confronted in this movie."</TE>
<TE>   The Bascos put every last penny of their money and some borrowed
from friends into "Naked Brown Men."</TE>
<TE>   Their dedication to the project is the result of years of hard
work, frustration, rejection and a strong work ethic: "We still have
to work parking cars or catering parties because we have to
supplement our income so we can remain sane and have a career and
lifestyle that we can actually live with," Darion says.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers started their careers in Pittsburg, Calif., a small
suburb of San Francisco. Their mother, afraid her children might be
lured into local gangs, enrolled them in dance classes. Soon enough,
the boys were break-dancing their way through various competitions
and showcases. When the brothers expressed an interest in acting,
their mother packed up a van and drove them to Los Angeles. The
family stayed in a tiny La Palma apartment, and their father, who had
to stay behind to work in the Bay Area, would visit on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, with Dante's TV commercial and "Hook" success, the
family, including Dad, moved to a home in Paramount. It was there
that the Bascos picked up street slang and a love of basketball.</TE>
<TE>   This part of their persona has caused some friction between the
brothers and their Asian American fans. Some accuse the brothers of
"acting black" and claim they are ignoring their heritage. The
brothers perform together in a hip-hop group, Fly Brown Dragons, and
although they've performed at the Whisky and the Coconut Teaszer in
Los Angeles, their "black" rap style sparks negative reactions from
some Asian Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Dion lets the criticism slide: "When I first started hearing this
stuff, it hurt a little bit. But I've come to realize that we're
artists, and we put ourselves out there every day, and we can't
please everybody. We have the best intentions and we believe in our
work, and that's what matters."</TE>
<TE>   Their family has other issues. Although their mother helped get
them into the field, the Bascos' lack of major success has put a
strain on the relationship: "Our mom, aunts and uncles don't
understand our lifestyle of not having a steady paycheck or dumping
thousands of dollars into our movie," Derek says.</TE>
<TE>   Emily Cho, a talent and literary manager at the firm
Dayton-Milrad-Cho, says: "They're such a tight-knit group, the four
of them, I've never seen anything like it. And that is the epitome of
family; they have each others' backs and there is a fierce loyalty
there," says Cho, who is Derek's wife.</TE>
<TE>   Adds Derek: "We will resolve the issues we have with our family,
but in the meantime this is our family--us and our tight-knit circle
of friends."</TE>
<TE>   It is precisely this attitude that has allowed the Basco brothers
to persevere; at the end of a tough day of competition, they can
still sit down and eat dinner together.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, their primary concern is editing and finding
distribution for "Naked Brown Men." Although they are excited about
its potential, they try to remain realistic. "My biggest hope is that
everyone gets to see this movie," Dante says. "As for my biggest
fear? I don't have any fear. After everything we've been through,
there's no more fear because I know what we did. We're already in
motion as artists."</TE>

<HD>The Changing Faces of Docents</HD>
<DH>Many museums are looking to meet the needs of visitors by
diversifying their staffs of guides and educators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Youthful, long-haired and dapper, Francisco George isn't quite who
you expect to see leading museum tours.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes I feel a little self-conscious because of my hair, my
age and what I wear," said the 41-year-old George, an artist who
makes his living selling vintage collectibles at the Rose Bowl swap
meets. He's always wanted to attend art school, but with the
expensive tuition, he opted to learn about art history at the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art--as a docent.</LD>
<LD>   Many museums have a program for docents, a fancy title given to
volunteers who teach, or they pay "art educators"--mostly scholars,
historians, graduate students or artists--to do the honors. Volunteer
docents study for one to five years before they can lead exhibition
tours, present lectures and hold workshops at schools or at the
museums. They also answer visitors' simple, commonly asked questions:
"Where's the restroom?" or "Which way to the gift shop?"</LD>
<TE>   George represents the changing face of docents throughout Southern
California. New recruits at museums both large and small are breaking
conventional molds. These days, they aren't just cheery retirees.
They're working professionals, parents, self-employed entrepreneurs
and students, ranging from their teens to mid-50s.</TE>
<TE>   Diversification has been in the air at museum docent councils for
the last five years. "Our goal is for visitors to feel that someone
reflects their group," said Louise Palermo, an education specialist
and docent coordinator who oversees the 530-member docent program at
the J. Paul Getty Museum.</TE>
<TE>   "Your stereotypical docent is a 51-year-old woman with white hair,
and God bless them, we need them. But we have them as well as younger
people and men."</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of docent programs in Southern California say one-third to
one-half of recruits are increasingly male, bilingual, younger than
50 and from different ethnic backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We have docents who speak Spanish, Russian, French, German and
communicate in American Sign Language," said education director Kim
Hayden of the Autry Museum of Western Heritage. At the Autry, in a
docent program with 100 volunteers, those who work in the collection
and conservation department are called "Buffalo Dusters." Others who
help organize member activities and large events such as exhibition
openings are dubbed "Trailblazers."</TE>
<TE>   "Without docents, I think museums risk becoming far too insular.
They're integral to our success," Hayden said, adding that the
volunteers are 10% of the museum's work force. They donate 20,000
hours in a year--the equivalent of 11 full-time staffers--and save
the museum $400,000 annually.</TE>
<TE>   As they guide tours or stuff, lick and stamp envelopes, Hayden
adds, they give the institution personality.</TE>
<TE>   "Every member of my family participates in the museum. My grandson
comes to vacuum and my granddaughters come and file papers and clean
a bit," said docent Ann Beasley of the Surf Museum. The small, quirky
Huntington Beach institution is run entirely by 50 volunteers, who
elect 11 directors to act as officers.</TE>
<TE>   George relishes volunteering, and not just at LACMA. He spends his
weekdays heading a local historic preservation group and working at
the thrift shop at his church. In October, after a year of intense
study, he became a docent and says the work is challenging. Demanding
tour schedules test George's resolve on tough days. But there's
satisfaction in the work. For the next five years, he'll be working
exclusively with children.</TE>
<TE>   "I do it for the kids. This is about fun, to help the kids have
fun with art. It helps for them to see a Latino man's face, the color
of my skin, and they need to hear my accent. Most of the
schoolchildren can identify with me," said George, who leads
pigtailed, braces-wearing, energetic schoolchildren on tours through
LACMA's permanent collection, where they encounter mummies and
Chinese scrolls.</TE>
<TE>   George discovered the volunteer program after he answered a
newspaper ad seeking bilingual docents at LACMA. "I had no idea what
docents did. Being a docent now [lets] me to nurture my artistic side
and give back to the community," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Museums are beginning to rely on bilingual docents such as George
to reach out to an increasing number of multicultural visitors. In
addition to its core 140 docents, the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art
in Santa Ana began an "ambassadors" program for Chinese tourists
during the run of its high-profile exhibition "Secret World of the
Forbidden City: Splendors From China's Imperial Palace."</TE>
<TE>   "We had anticipated there would be a lot of Chinese visitors for
this exhibit. If we had Chinese-speaking ambassadors, they would feel
more at home," said Anne Shih, president of the Chinese Arts Council
and a board member at Bowers.</TE>
<TE>   The right docent can really enhance a visit to the Getty or any
museum, says Palermo.</TE>
<TE>   "A good [touring] docent helps you focus on a few things instead
of having you absorb the entire museum in one visit, which can be
overwhelming," Palermo said. "We want people to have a meaningful
experience with art, so we're looking for volunteers who are
friendly, willing and who have a desire to help others learn and
discover."</TE>
<TE>   "The difference with a job is that you're going in to work each
day because you have to," said Sheila Good, former chairwoman of the
564-member Docents Council at LACMA and an active docent. "As a
docent, you learn something simply because you want to. That's just a
delicious feeling, and you're with others who feel that same way."</TE>
<TE>   "All my friends are docents except two. It's a tightknit group,"
said Rosalind Sanger, a bilingual docent for the Getty since 1997 and
LACMA since 1977. "When I have lunch with my friends, we're talking
about art."</TE>
<TE>   Many docents take field trips and art tours together. They also
get a few perks: glossy catalogs, meetings with their favorite
artists, museum lunches and parties where artists, collectors and
others gather.</TE>
<TE>   They may be volunteers, but being a docent is a significant
responsibility in most of the major museums. Homework can take up to
20 hours a week. There are assignments to read, research trips to
make, videos to watch and museum lectures to attend.</TE>
<TE>   At most museums, docents write their own scripts for exhibition
tours that can change every month. Minimum work hours are required.
Some docent programs require extra fees, museum memberships and
uniforms. Quizzes, exams and evaluations are common.</TE>
<TE>   After training, the education continues with lectures by curators,
guest artists and speakers, workshops, and group tours to private
collections, art studios or other museums and galleries.</TE>
<TE>   "Docents tend to be lifelong learners, and we provide them with
plenty of opportunity," Hayden said.</TE>
<TE>   Peer reviews or annual evaluations allow some docent councils keep
up standards. "When you do it for a long time, you can start to slack
a bit," LACMA and Getty docent Sanger. LACMA docents are evaluated by
their peers every two years.</TE>
<TE>   Being a docent can be competitive at times, with docents vying for
elected seats on councils or in subcommittees. In large and small
docent circles, there can be political infighting. Things can get
downright scandalous at times. In 1999, LACMA deemed a docent's
description to a school tour of Edward Kienholz's "Back Seat Dodge
'38"--a work that depicted a couple in what appears to be a drunken
sexual embrace--as inappropriate. She was dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   But docents generally aren't that high-profile. Many simply become
lifelong friends of the museum--members or even donors. Last year,
the Orange County Museum of Art received about $710,000 from a couple
who served as longtime docents. The money, earmarked for the
endowment, helped fund the museum's 125-member volunteer program,
which was renamed the Camille and Eric Durand Docent Council in their
honor.</TE>
<TE>   Docent programs, however, don't work for all museums. Venues such
as the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena and Los Angeles' Museum of
Contemporary Art do not have docent programs.</TE>
<TE>   "When you just go for volunteers, you just don't have that high
quality control," said Suzanne Isken, MOCA's education director.</TE>
<TE>   In place of docents, these museums have hired art educators,
part-time staff who lead exhibition tours.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a contemporary art scene that requires us to stay on top
of now, the everyday. It's not historically placed," said Isken, who
oversees the paid "gallery educators," who replaced docents at MOCA
in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "So that makes contemporary art very complex," she continued.
"Many people who come to the museum with a degree of fear or
intimidation of contemporary art want someone to explain and help
them understand the art. The paid educators spend their lives with
this."</TE>
<TE>   For museums that rely on volunteer docents, flexible, weekend
hours and other incentives are helping to further diversify the
volunteer group.</TE>
<TE>   "I admire the commitment of many of the longtime docents. They
know the exhibitions and artists all by heart. I want to be like
those older ladies in about 30 or so years," George said.</TE>

<LD>The "Brad Hall question" begs to be addressed ("Married ... With
Issues," by Paul Brownfield, Feb. 10). Your article was useful, in a
People magazine way, missing some details. For example, the fateful
dinner party where Hall met his mentor, Gary David Goldberg, happened
at the time that Julia Louis-Dreyfus was a regular on a TV show ("Day
by Day") produced by Goldberg's company.</LD>
<LD>   No doubt about it, Brad Hall is a lucky guy. Not the luckiest guy
in town, because anyone who gets a "created by" credit in TV land is
lucky (if not also talented).</LD>
<LD>   I don't covet his beautiful, well-known wife because I call
attention to a bigger, more important issue, one for the Writers
Guild: Why are four men doing all the writing on a show about a
single woman? There is nothing "pure" about that. Nor is it
"different" in terms of doing business. But Brad Hall is really,
really happy and, therefore, a good citizen.</LD>

<TE>   I'd be interested in learning why Brownfield feels his personal
opinions on people's relationships and their vehicles for success are
appropriate in his article on "Watching Ellie."</TE>
<TE>   And what exactly did Brownfield do in his research on this show
and Brad Hall? Walk into a writer-friendly cafe and ask around for
anything nasty that someone had to say about the man? Place some
phone calls to industry "connections" to get their personal opinions?
This article appears to be nothing but a thinly veiled, bitter rant.</TE>
<TE>   I guess it's just easier for Brownfield to dig up some dirt to
support his preconceived opinions and collect a "well-deserved"
paycheck at the end of the week than to write an unbiased story on a
show and those who create it.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As assistant director members of the Directors Guild of America,
we have more than 50 years of experience among the four of us. We
feel, therefore, that we can speak from a wide variety of contacts
with various show-runners, writers and executive producers over the
many episodes we have all worked on.</TE>
<TE>   We take exception to the light in which Brad Hall, the show-runner
of "Watching Ellie," was portrayed in Brownfield's article. The Brad
we know is extremely involved in the day-to-day running of the show,
always present on the set when we are shooting, and accessible to
both cast and crew for questions and suggestions. He is not, as the
article implied, someone who doesn't "trust his writers" or is
"harried" in any way. It seems as though Brownfield went out of his
way to find two (anonymous) sources that would say unkind things
about Brad, and even those two sources were more nebulous than
negative.</TE>
<TE>   The worst offense by Brownfield was his conclusion that the
"scuttlebutt around town is generally cynical about 'Watching
Ellie's' prospects for survival." If Brownfield has an opinion about
the show, let him critique "Watching Ellie," rather than repeat rumor
and innuendo. In the future, we hope a profile of a man of Brad's
caliber can be written by a journalist with less of a chip on his
shoulder than Brownfield seems to have.</TE>

<LD>Lewis Segal's Perspective on trading "bootleg" ballet videos brings
up crucial questions about copyright law ("Psst--Wanna See a Ballet
Video?," Feb. 10), the most important being making art available to
the most people while not violating the copyright owners' ability to
profit from their work.</LD>
<LD>   Since home video became a viable medium in the late '70s, hundreds
of bootleg videos have hit the streets. Many violated clearly defined
copyrights--and deserved to be stopped. However, many also brought to
eager fans films/TV shows/concerts/performances that were thought
"lost" or "unavailable."</LD>
<LD>   Over the years, studios have gone after independent video
distributors who brought these treasures to the public. In some
cases, the studio or copyright holder eventually put out authorized
versions. But in the vast majority of cases, these productions simply
remain in the vaults, never to be seen again. Who truly benefits?</LD>
<TE>   People who search out these rarities are the same people who will
shell out $9 to see a film in theaters, pay $20 for the VHS tape, and
then pay $20 again for the DVD.</TE>
<TE>   I feel that as long as a good-faith agreement exists that if a
"legit" version is released the "bootleg" version will be pulled from
distribution, the public wins.</TE>

<TE>   Dance companies are perennially and legendarily short of funds,
and no one expects a dance company director to be an expert on
copyright. However, it must be extremely difficult for students of
dance to truly understand or master their medium when so much of its
history is inaccessible.</TE>
<TE>   Dance companies should make a priority of assembling film and
video archives and agreeing on a mode of dissemination. Such a task,
properly organized, would be a perfect project for company interns or
volunteers. If the difficulties raised by performers' rights concerns
are truly so overwhelming, it might be necessary for companies to
reconstruct and restage certain works. They should do so before the
original recordings are lost. Dance need no longer be an ephemeral
art.</TE>

<LD>Elizabeth Jensen's analysis of issues of "personality" versus
"journalism" confronting CNN with the onslaught of competition from
Fox and MSNBC mirrors America's battle pitting conservative patriots
editorializing the news to fit their agenda against the so-called
"liberal media" who attempt to remain objective ("News Still Counts
at CNN. So Do Stars," Feb. 3).</LD>
<LD>   Bernard Shaw's retirement from CNN left an enormous void; filling
it with Paula, Aaron and Connie makes perfect sense, as they all have
demonstrated journalistic integrity in their careers.</LD>
<LD>   The real backbone of CNN, however, is their home-grown stars who
never receive the respect they are due.</LD>
<TE>   Bill Hemmer not only possesses boy-next-door good looks, he's
smart and always full of facts. Kate Snow's cover-girl beauty belies
her intelligence, dedication, and the respect of everyone on Capitol
Hill. Leon Harris is a man for all seasons, truly gifted. Same with
Miles O'Brien, aerodynamic expert; Kyra Philips; Rosemary Church; and
others.</TE>
<TE>   If you enjoy a bunch of talking-head reactionary rejects from the
Big 3 justifying the administration's policies and mistakes, then I
suppose you'll tune in Fox. There's room for both.</TE>

<HD>Two Artists, Connected by the Music</HD>
<DH>Dancer Jose Navas and cellist Walter Haman find harmony in
a fusion of their talents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Venezuela-born choreographer Jose Navas--the driving force behind
Compagnie Flak, the Montreal-based group he founded in 1995--had
previously only worked with living composers. As for working with a
classically trained musician on stage? No way, said Jose.</LD>
<LD>   But that was before he met cellist Walter Haman at the Banff Arts
Centre in Canada in 1999. While Navas had been finishing a piece for
Flak (the troupe's name means "trunk" in Swedish), Haman, principal
cellist of the Spoleto Festival Orchestra in Italy and the Napa
Valley Symphony, was a resident artist in that bucolic Canadian
Rockies setting.</LD>
<LD>   Initially, Navas, 37, had been somewhat skeptical when an eager
Haman, who was born and raised in Fresno, and at 28 lives in San
Francisco, approached the more seasoned performer.</LD>
<TE>   "Walter came up with the idea of collaborating, and honestly, to
me, it was an interesting invitation," Navas recalls by phone from
Toronto. "But I wasn't interested in doing a solo show [with an
onstage musician]. I was more interested in working with the company.
Once we started talking, and he showed me different pieces, though, I
realized this was such a different feeling, that I started to get
real excited."</TE>
<TE>   That excitement led to the creation of the Haman/Navas Project,
and a spare, 60-minute, untitled sound-and-music collaboration. The
sounds, in this case, are those of Benjamin Britten's Cello Suite No.
1, and a lesser known work, "Yakamochi," by composer Allan Hovhaness.</TE>
<TE>   Currently in the midst of a six-city, two-month North American
tour, the duo will give the work its West Coast premiere at the
Skirball Cultural Center on Thursday and Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just wonderful music," Navas says, "and it has opened up a
huge window for me. I was pushed to understand music in a different
way, and I saw that diving into the project was going to change me
personally."</TE>
<TE>   Haman explains that they'd purposely eliminated obvious musical
choices--Bach's unaccompanied cello suites, for example, and began
digging into the rather large repertory of the 20th century cello
canon, listening to a number of recordings, as well as unearthing
more rarified pieces, specifically the Hovhaness, a work that has yet
to be recorded.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to venture into new ground," Haman says, adding, "It's
like chamber music, but it's between a dancer and a musician, rather
than two musicians."</TE>
<TE>   Navas began his studies in Caracas, moving to New York in 1988.
There, in addition to working with Stephen Petronio and Lucinda
Childs, he met and subsequently began working with Nova Scotia-born
choreographer William Douglas and his company, William Douglas Dance.
The pair was contemplating a move to Amsterdam but made a stop,
instead, in Montreal in 1991. "We liked it so much--the community
itself and the life in Montreal--that we gave it a try. Eleven years
later I'm still there," Navas says, adding wryly, "It was sort of a
long stop."</TE>
<TE>   It yielded a fruitful partnership in both their personal and
professional lives. In 1995, Navas and Douglas shared the prestigious
Bessie Award for a solo Douglas choreographed called "While Waiting."
Sadly, Douglas died of AIDS the following year, but not before he saw
Navas succeed in starting Compagnie Flak. Since then, Navas has
created more than a dozen works, as well as pieces for other troupes.</TE>
<TE>   Among the latter have been a trio for Canadian
dancer-choreographer Benoit Lachambre and a work for eight dancers
for Montreal Danse in 1997-98. For Flak, in 2000, Navas made "Perfume
de Gardenias," which Dance magazine described as "slicing limbs, and
quick stops and starts with sinewy wiggles."</TE>
<TE>   But it is Navas' solo work, with its flair for passion and sense
of the dramatic, that has consistently drawn praise, and for which
the dancer is probably best known.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, New York choreographer Bill T. Jones created "Sonata and
... ," which Navas performed at the Internationale Tanzwochen
Festival in Vienna. In 1998, the Toronto Globe and Mail wrote of
Navas' "exquisitely taut" performance. He "recalls Nureyev and
Nijinsky," the reviewer wrote, "male dancers ... of similar feral
intensity."</TE>
<TE>   Navas ponders this notion, responding with measure. "Of course, I
think it's wonderful, but I wonder if it's because there are few male
soloists pursuing a career in contemporary dance, and that's the
closest thing we can relate to. Or is it because I'm dark-haired,
dark-skinned and a small dancer? It is," he adds modestly, "an easy
way to inform the audience about what you're going to see."</TE>
<TE>   What audiences have seen with the Haman/Navas Project has elicited
a variety of reactions. On a bare stage and with minimal lighting,
the work opens in silence, followed by an elegant andante cello
passage. Responding to the music, Navas fills the space with
movements ranging from athletic pirouettes to those that have him
tracing his hands around Haman, and making physical contact. At one
point Navas kisses Haman's fingertips.</TE>
<TE>   While the New York Times' Jack Anderson praised the work as
"poignant ... a tribute to the power of music and movement," the
interaction of dancer and musician caused audience members to walk
out of a theater in Prague.</TE>
<TE>   "I think some people may feel extremely comfortable if [the piece]
were [performed] by a man and a woman," Navas points out, "but
between two men--some people find it offensive. But that's the beauty
of the piece. With no set and no [formal] costumes, there is a very
strong relation between the two of us on stage." Haman hadn't worked
with a dancer before but finds the collaboration fascinating. "To be
able to break out of the more traditional classical
roles--orchestras, recitals, things like that--to be on stage, doing
what I do, it's wonderful.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's about how the two relate to each other. We're feeding
off of each other with a live presence. Jose designed a lot of his
choreography around me, kind of involving me. Sometimes when you see
live music on stage with dance, it might as well be a CD. There's
nothing in the dance that relates to that actual person. This is
something very different."</TE>
<TE>   Navas, who is directing a play in Montreal after leaving Los
Angeles, will take his eight-member Compagnie Flak to Switzerland in
April. In between his company's concerts, he resumes touring with the
Haman/Navas Project, with stops in England in May and at the Venice
Biennale. The work has been so satisfying that Navas says he wants it
to be long term, with this outing only the first chapter.</TE>
<TE>   "When we decided to make the piece, we talked a lot about making a
duo--that it wasn't about a musician in the corner of the stage. We
wanted to make a staging of two artists, two guys, two personalities,
and see how the fusion between musician and dancer could be seamless.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to have a second volume," Navas continues, "where
we may have another musician on stage. We may have a composer for
cello, and we may have another dancer, as well. But in the end, my
work is very personal, and I want to keep it that way. If it doesn't
go all the way," he adds emphatically, I'm not interested in it."</TE>

<HD>What Pressure? Moby Isn't Shooting for 'Play'-Size Sales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moby has an Olympian task looming--and we're not talking about his
scheduled performance in the Salt Lake City Winter Games' closing
ceremony next Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The challenge awaiting the electronic rocker is to repeat the 2.4
million U.S. and nearly 10 million worldwide sales of his
breakthrough 1999 album "Play" with the follow-up "18," due in stores
May 14. Moby has a plan in regard to reaching those heights again:
don't.</LD>
<LD>   "I saw the success of 'Play' as an anomaly," says the New York
musician, whose next-best in U.S. sales is 1995's "Everything Is
Wrong" with 180,000. "Most records I've made haven't sold blindingly
well, so making this record, I thought, 'If I end up making something
that sells well, that's terrific, but I'm not expecting it.'"</LD>
<TE>   Neither are the executives at the labels that release his albums,
the independents V2 Records in the U.S. and Canada, and Mute Records
in the rest of the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither company has put commercial expectations on me," Moby
says. "We'd have meetings and they would listen to songs and wonder
if perhaps they were too commercial. I can't imagine this happening
often in the world of corporate music."</TE>
<TE>   Not that the label executives would reject "Play"-level sales.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unrealistic that this will sell the same number of records,"
V2 President Andy Gershon says. "But it absolutely will touch anyone
who bought 'Play.' That's the challenge to the label, to market this
record to the people who bought 'Play' and might not have been true
fans of Moby, but bought the record because it was such a huge
lifestyle record.</TE>
<TE>   "'Play' had that word of mouth and that magic every record company
wants, whether it's a 'Play' or something like 'O Brother, Where Art
Thou?' that seeps into the consciousness of so many people."</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what "Play" did, taking more than a year to get any
meaningful sales and radio exposure, then getting a second wind from
the single "Southside."</TE>
<TE>   But it didn't come saddled with a precedent of big sales; "18"
does.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to be freaking out and going, 'Oh my God, what will
we do?' if this album doesn't take off right away," Gershon says. "We
can afford to be patient."</TE>
<TE>   One thing that won't be part of the marketing plan is something
that proved a key part of the "Play" breakthrough. Every song on that
album was licensed for use in at least one film, TV show or
commercial.</TE>
<TE>   "I was criticized for that by a lot of people from a lot of
quarters," Moby says. "That's understandable. I would criticize me as
well. But when 'Play' was released, no one was interested in it. The
only people interested were people making commercials and movies.
When they came to us, I of course said yes. That led to commercial
promiscuity, and with this record I'll probably be less promiscuous."</TE>
<TE>   The new album likely will appeal to "Play" fans, although it's
hardly a repeat. While some of the songs use the kind of soul and
blues vocal samples that were at the core of its predecessor, Moby
reaches into new territory as well.</TE>
<TE>   The opening song and first single, "We Are All Made of Stars,"
evokes '80s new wave, with a guitar part recalling Roxy Music's Phil
Manzanera. And guest appearances by Sinead O'Connor, Angie Stone with
MC Lyte, indie-pop female duo Azure Ray and a sample of a '70s soul
song by Sylvia Robinson provide an aesthetic thread.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a more feminine record in the sense that it's a
little warmer," Moby says. "'Play' had some songs with harsh edges.
In '18,' even when it gets more up-tempo, it's still more feminine."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Moby has now made albums following up flops ("Play"
came after 1997's disappointing "Animal Rights") and one following up
a hit.</TE>
<TE>   Hit is better.</TE>
<TE>   "People keep saying there must be so much pressure," he says. "In
my mind there wasn't. Since 'Play' was so successful, more people
will be paying attention. Hopefully I've made something worthy of the
attention."</TE>
<TE>   HARDBALL: The Rock the Vote organization--which holds its annual
Patrick Lippert Awards on Feb. 26 honoring the Dave Matthews Band,
Destiny's Child and "West Wing" creator Aaron Sorkin at the House of
Blues--plans to launch a sure-to-be-controversial campaign with three
public service announcement television spots challenging what some
view as the unquestioning nationalism that came in the wake of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. In one of the spots, which are due to
begin airing in March, a school class recites a variation of the
Pledge of Allegiance that in addition to saluting the flag affirms a
national mandate to harm the environment and get oil "no matter
what."</TE>
<TE>   "The spots look at traditional American symbols and adjust them to
bring light to certain issues," Rock the Vote deputy director Jehmu
Green says. "We are definitely trying to push viewers to look at
other sides of issues. We have strong feelings about the need to
protect freedom of expression and use these ads to show that you
wouldn't want to give up certain freedoms in the name of fighting for
freedom, to paraphrase Benjamin Franklin."</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: L.A. hip-hop group Dilated Peoples has signed on to
headline a tour in conjunction with "Scratch," a documentary about
the evolution of DJ turntable artistry. Joining them will be pioneer
scratcher Grand Wizard Theodore and DJs Z-Trip and Jazzy Jay, with
special guests in most cities, all performing in between excerpts
from the film. Tour stops include March 6 at the Palace and March 7
at the Anaheim House of Blues.... After some uncertainty about the
band's future, Hootie &amp; the Blowfish have reconvened in L.A. to start
a new album with producer Don Was. This will be the group's first
collection of new material since 1998's "Musical Chairs." No release
date has been set.... 'N Sync's Chris Kirkpatrick can be heard poking
fun at his boy-band world as a guest voice in the second-season
premiere of Nickelodeon's animated "The Fairly OddParents," airing
March 1. Kirkpatrick voices Chip Skylark, a teen-pop sensation
kidnapped by a smitten girl.... Rancid's Tim Armstrong has done a
guest vocal on the coming album by Blink-182 guitarist Tom DeLonge's
side project, Box Car Racer, due May 14. Blink bassist Mark Hoppus
had already done a guest spot on another track.</TE>

<TE>   Gospo Centric</TE>
<TE>   Gospel is just fine as is. It remains such a key source of power
and feeling within popular music that maybe the sound didn't need an
update. But Kirk Franklin has managed for nearly a decade to inject
hip-hop and modern R&amp;B into classic gospel without cheapening the
music or forgetting its original purpose. Not better, but potent just

charts, Franklin ignites his gospel with a musical awareness that
puts him in direct competition with secular pop. (His last solo album
was 1998's 2-million-selling "Nu Nation Project.") And while some of
"The Rebirth of Kirk Franklin" (due in stores Tuesday) is sugary
soul-pop, other passages retain a rousing, tradition-based sound,
recruiting such stirring gospel voices as Shirley Caesar and the late
Willie Neal Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Other sounds emerge in unexpected ways. The confessional "911"
tackles fears of modern terrorism in a setting that weirdly suggests
the super-smooth rhythms and breathy vocals of Barry White. More
often, Franklin finds inspiration in '70s-era Stevie Wonder, in the
horn-powered funk of "Brighter Day" and the quietly passionate ballad
"The Blood Song."</TE>
<TE>   Another Wonder precedent can be found in the album's dramatic
opening, which re-creates the abandonment and spiritual rescue of
Franklin as a child.</TE>
<TE>   The two-minute track is just wrenching and realistic enough that
some listeners may skip past it on quieter Sunday mornings. But
"Rebirth" never strays off message: It's Christian music aimed mainly
at a Christian audience. But like classic gospel, the best of
Franklin's deeply emotional music can resonate loudly for anyone.</TE>

<TE>   "Queen of the Damned"</TE>
<TE>   soundtrack</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros./Reprise</TE>
<TE>   In the latest adaptation from Anne Rice's vampire novel series,
the bloodsucker Lestat (Stuart Townsend) has become a rock star whose
haunting sounds cause a banished vampire queen (played by the late
Aaliyah) to reawaken and create havoc on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   While it could have been really intriguing if the filmmakers had
cast an actual rock singer in the role, they did the next best thing
by enlisting Korn's Jonathan Davis to write Lestat's music and do the
singing parts in the film.</TE>
<TE>   But due to contractual restrictions that limit the Epic Records
artist's appearances on other labels, Davis' vocals aren't heard on
the album (in stores Tuesday). Instead, he and writing partner
Richard Gibbs hired some stunt doubles from the ranks of Davis' gloom
metal peers. The result is a collection that's malevolent and
melodramatic at times, but never monotonous.</TE>
<TE>   With more bewitching, Bauhaus-like goth melodies than brutal aggro
rhythms, Davis' tunes seem to gain texture with each successive vocal
style, from voracious (Static-X's Wayne Static on "Not Meant for Me")
to frustrated (Linkin Park's Chester Bennington on "System") to
otherworldly (Marilyn Manson on "Redeemer").</TE>
<TE>   The five new tracks (which are supplemented by older songs from
Deftones, Static-X, Tricky and others) conjure up the right blend of
sensuality and menace, but it will be hard for listeners not to
wonder how Davis' trademark anguished growls will sound on each cut,
and whether he interprets this material in the dark and tormented way
that makes Korn's music so compelling. That makes the album not just
an intriguing musical experiment, but also an incentive to go see the
movie. Lina Lecaro</TE>

<TE>   "I Break Chairs"</TE>
<TE>   Sub Pop</TE>
<TE>   What has this enduring Seattle folkie gathered? Bandmates. A
repertoire. And momentum, if his fourth album (due Tuesday) finally
allows the chronically mopey singer-songwriter to emerge from a large
shadow--his own.</TE>
<TE>   Shifting seamlessly from crunchy rockers to meandering mini-dramas
to finger-picked confidences, Jurado and band provide a sonic context
for powerful storytelling. The frontman's vocals are the main
attraction, a resonant husk that cuts a swath through all manner of
atmospherics. Jurado need not sell a song, only sing it.</TE>
<TE>   His protagonists wage mighty battles, mostly with themselves. Not
that anybody's writing them off. "Don't ever let me lose my head,"
Jurado pleads on the album's finale, but by then it's apparent he has
found his.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Bronson</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   *** Luka Bloom, "Between the Mountain and the Moon," Bar/None.
Although the Irish singer-songwriter's sixth album is often as
subdued as it is sensual--most of the songs don't have drums--this
might be the one to give him a David Gray-like shot at belated
mainstream attention. His mix of humid romance ("Monsoon"), tributes
to fortitude and dedication ("Love Is a Place I Dream Of," a duet
with Sinead O'Connor, honors a Dublin woman who works with homeless
children) and music informed by both his cultural roots and a global
perspective is a seductive package.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Hochman</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2 Kosheen, "Resist," Kinetic. This U.K. dance-music trio's
surprisingly mature debut album (due Tuesday) establishes a solid
identity while moving through a wide range of musical styles. From
the techno "Cover" to the soulful ballad "Harder" to the smooth beats
of the title track, there's never any question it's Kosheen, thanks
to the distinct vocals of frontwoman Sian Evans.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Baltin</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 Kevin Tihista's Red Terror, "Don't Breathe a Word,"
Atlantic. To hear this Chicagoan tell it, even sensitive, soft-pop
guys have urges. "Oh honey, I'm in distress," Tihista coos on the
second of a dozen sugary love songs, "So what's it gonna take for you
to lose the dress?" Either the most subversive pop or the gentlest
rock album ever made, Tihista's debut undulates between heartache and
headache, never too far from a strum and a sigh and reluctant to get
too self-conscious about it. K.B.</TE>
<TE>   Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair),
three stars (good) and four stars (excellent). The albums are already
released unless otherwise noted.</TE>

<DH>Although still in debt, Pasadena Playhouse made great
strides in 2001 toward erasing its deficit.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Pasadena Playhouse box office did well in 2001. Three of the
playhouse's five top-grossing shows, since the theater was reopened
in 1986, played last year. The holiday edition of "Forever Plaid" is
in third place, "Do I Hear a Waltz?" in fourth and "Side Man" in
fifth--the best-selling nonmusical in playhouse history.
("Sisterella" and "Play On!" are in first and second place.)</LD>
<LD>   So the playhouse bottom line looks great, right?</LD>
<LD>   Not quite. Because of drops in contributed income related to the
recession and Sept. 11, the playhouse had a 5% operating deficit last
year--not an unusual performance for resident theaters of comparable
budgets but perhaps surprising in light of the box office figures.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the playhouse has made great strides toward erasing its
debt in recent years, according to recent figures provided by the
company. Between the end of 1997 and the end of 2001, the playhouse's
total debt dropped to $405,376 from $1,661,827. In total assets and
debits, the playhouse ended 1998 more than $3 million in the red; it
ended 2001 $812,296 in the red.</TE>

<TE>   BARRIERS MOVED: Police barricades that were blocking direct access
to the David Henry Hwang Theatre, the Little Tokyo home of East West
Players, have been moved half a block north on Judge John Aiso
Street.</TE>
<TE>   Theater employees and patrons can now turn north from 1st Street
to Judge John Aiso Street and approach the theater and its adjacent
parking lot with no impediments. But access to Judge John Aiso Street
and the theater is still blocked from Temple Street, on the north end
of the block.</TE>
<TE>   The barricades went up in October in response to the possibility
of terrorist attacks against Police Department headquarters, across
the street from the theater. Automobiles had to go through a police
checkpoint  before they were allowed on the block, and theater
officials feared the barricades deterred some of their customers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LA JOLLA LARGESS: La Jolla Playhouse recently announced $5.2
million in new gifts, topped by $2 million from Joel and Rosanne
Holliday. Joel Holliday was the former chief financial officers of
Applied Micro Circuits. The money is going toward a campaign to raise
$36 million, of which $27 million has already been raised since 1997,
led by a 1999 gift of $5 million from Qualcomm founder Irwin Jacobs
and his wife, Joan.</TE>
<TE>   Some of that money will go toward a new building, to be named
after the Jacobses, that will house the company's offices, its
educational and outreach programs, rehearsal and shop space, and a
black box theater. It was originally slated to cost about $7.5
million, with the black box seating only about 200.</TE>
<TE>   But the capacity has moved up to 500 since the return of Des
McAnuff to his previous job as artistic director, and a new projected
price tag is expected within a month. Groundbreaking is scheduled for
next fall, with an opening in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WILL THEY BUY IT?: Santa Monica Playhouse is trying to raise
$450,000 in the next 16 months to buy half of the building it has
rented for 40 years. Otherwise, the rent will rise to the prohibitive
level of $13,000 a month, said Evelyn Rudie, one of the artistic
directors of the company, which operates two sub-100-seat theaters in
downtown Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   REPRISE LINE-UP: The next Reprise! season will open with "Follies"
(June 16-23) at the Wadsworth Theater, followed by three shows at the
group's usual home base, UCLA's Freud Playhouse: "Anything Goes"
(Sept. 18-29), "On the Twentieth Century" (Jan. 22-Feb. 2, 2003) and
a 50th-anniversary production of "Kismet" (March 19-30, 2003).</TE>

<TE>   24 HOURS: Remember what it was like to pull an all-nighter in
order to turn in a paper on time? A group of playwrights will revisit
that experience next weekend--on behalf of the New York State World
Trade Center Relief Fund, not for the benefit of a better grade.</TE>
<TE>   For "The 24 Hour Plays," Beth Henley, Neil LaBute, Bruce Vilanch,
John Belluso, Matthew Carnahan, Raven Metzner and Stu Zicherman will
spend next Saturday night and Sunday morning at Moxie Films in
Hollywood writing 10-minute plays that will be rehearsed Sunday and
presented to audiences at the Henry Fonda Theatre that night.</TE>
<TE>   The casts will include Christine Lahti, Mary Steenburgen, John
Ritter, Ione Skye, Jeffrey Jones, Donovan Leitch, Bob Balaban and
many more.</TE>
<TE>   The actors will report Saturday evening, briefly describe
themselves to the writers, and pose for a photo that the writers can
use as they create during the night. Each actor also will bring along
a prop and a costume that may or may not be used.</TE>
<TE>   At 7 a.m. Sunday, the writers will turn in scripts and the actors
will memorize lines and rehearse. There will be a one-hour technical
rehearsal for all six plays just prior to the 8 p.m. curtain.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets cost $50, $75 or $100. Information: (213) 365-3500 or
(714) 740-7878.</TE>

<TE>   GEFFEN GRANT: Geffen Playhouse has received its first grant from
the National Endowment for the Arts: $15,000 to commission and
develop a new play by Donald Margulies, whose "Collected Stories" and
"Dinner With Friends" have already played the Geffen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TOPANGA TIME: Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum's summer season will
include Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice" (June 2-Sept. 29);
Peter Hall's adaptation of George Orwell's "Animal Farm," with music
by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by Adrian Mitchell (June 29-Sept. 29);
Jean Giraudoux's "The Madwoman of Chaillot" (July 27-Oct. 19); and
Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (Sept. 2-Oct. 20).</TE>

<HD>Alchemist of Alternative Rap</HD>
<DH>DJ-producer Dan the Automator concocts tracks layered with
imagination and humor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC WEINGARTEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dan Nakamura is one of the planet's few platinum-selling artists who
can patronize a busy West Hollywood hotel and go unrecognized.
Hanging out in the lobby of the Mondrian, the quiet, unassuming San
Franciscan is just another guest talking about his passion for
hip-hop and hip-huggers. Not that he's exactly angling for attention.
Nakamura, as easygoing as they come, is a man who likes to work under
cover.</LD>
<LD>   Cooking up myriad projects with friends and other collaborators
from the worlds of rock and rap, the DJ and producer known in
underground hip-hop circles as Dan the Automator is dance music's
great alchemist of the moment. A prolific idea man who can weave
social criticism into party-time hip-hop or make non-ironic love
songs co-exist with sharp-tongued humor, Nakamura is one of the
leaders of the current alternative rap movement, a subgenre in which
craven materialism and casual sexism are ditched in favor of playful
experimentation.</LD>
<TE>   An album fan who likes to create CDs that coalesce as themes,
Nakamura has had a hand in some of the most venturesome hip-hop
records of the last few years, including "Dr. Octagonecologyst," a
collaboration with rapper Kool Keith; "Handsome Boy Modeling School,"
an album in which Nakamura and fellow producer Prince Paul play the
owners of a male modeling academy; "Deltron 3030," a dystopian
manifesto with the rapper Del Tha Funkee Homosapien; and "Lovage," a
meditation on love and sex in which the heavy-petting bedroom
imprecations come oozing out of the grooves.</TE>
<TE>   His latest, a set of remixes of tracks from such artists as Zero
7, Tortoise, the Doves and De la Soul called "Wanna Buy a Monkey?"
comes out Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   All of these albums contain a palimpsest of imaginative samples,
polished lyrics that play tricks with language and pop culture and
lots of dexterous turntable maneuvers. "Lovage," which is subtitled
"Music to Make Love to Your Old Lady By," strays further from hip-hop
than any previous Nakamura project and spotlights his songwriting
deftness.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason I make concept records is because I buy a lot of
records where there are only two or three good tracks," says
Nakamura, who speaks in a rushed torrent of words, as if his thoughts
are outrunning his mouth. "I just think that's a rip-off, and so I
wanna give people their money's worth.</TE>
<TE>   "When you listen to something like Vivaldi's 'Four Seasons,' it
takes you through thoughts and moods. I want to have a little bit of
that going on."</TE>
<TE>   Nakamura's most successful project thus far has been Gorillaz, a
"fake" hip-hop band whose 2001 self-titled album has sold more than a
million copies in the U.S. and landed on many critics'
best-of-the-year lists. A collaboration of Nakamura, Del and Damon
Albarn, singer of the English rock band Blur, Gorillaz is a cartoon
band whose "members" were drawn by Jamie Hewitt, best known as the
creator of the "Tank Girl" comic book.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes the fates smile on you," Nakamura says of the success
of the album. "I loved the record when I was making it, but you can't
predict what the public is gonna buy."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, Nakamura suggests, it has something to do with the fact
that Gorillaz was "the new version of the Archies!"</TE>
<TE>   Nakamura, who will be part of the live Gorillaz show that comes to
the Hollywood Palladium on March 8 and 9, is short-changing the
music, an amiable blend of acoustic exotica, Albarn's floating vocals
and Nakamura's gently knotty beats. It's not something he likes to
dwell on too much.</TE>
<TE>   "Music is not an analytical thing," he says. "People all have
different quirks and artistic sensibilities, and I just get a lot of
enjoyment working with all the people I work with."</TE>
<TE>   Given the current state of so much rock and rap, with singers
declaiming stridently with scowls and furrowed brows, Nakamura's use
of comedy is a curious anomaly. But it's become a trademark of sorts,
from the proto-"Zoolander" skits on "Handsome Boy ... " to the
tumescent posturing of "Lovage," which Nakamura calls his tribute to
"the love album of the kind that Marvin Gaye used to make." His use
of humor to communicate earnest messages is very effective.</TE>
<TE>   "Handsome Boy Modeling School," for example, is an album about the
artificiality of gangsta rap.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all about rappers who pick out alter egos," says Nakamura.
"We just took it to the extreme. I mean, why do [rappers] name
themselves after drug dealers and talk about all this money they're
making? What's to love about that? I'm not making a great message,
but I think social issues are relevant to what I'm doing. Humor is a
good way to get into people's heads."</TE>
<TE>   Nakamura, the son of a civil engineer and an educator, was trained
as a classical violinist from ages 3 to 15. But he chafed at the
rigors of his formal musical education and gravitated to rock and
hip-hop, eventually becoming a club DJ in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "Malcolm McLaren's World Famous Supreme Team brought it all
together for me," says Nakamura, citing the music impresario's 1983
hip-hop record "Duck Rock." "My love of record collecting, hip-hop,
turntables: It all kind of converged at once, and I thought, 'Yeah, I
see now.'"</TE>
<TE>   Nakamura's first record, a 1989 EP called "Music to Be Murdered
By," was, according to the artist, the first record to include sound
effects specifically for DJ turntable battling. He eventually hooked
up with the hip-hop label Solesides and worked on a number of
records, including DJ Shadow's seminal 1996 album "Endtroducing ...
," which was recorded at Nakamura's studio, the Glue Factory.</TE>
<TE>   Nakamura's modus operandi from the start of his hip-hop career has
been to work on projects that strike his fancy and maybe sell some
records in the process. The fact that "Gorillaz" has performed as
well as it has is just a bonus, not validation.</TE>
<TE>   The album's Grammy nomination for best rap performance by a duo or
group, for the single "Clint Eastwood," has been a kick, however.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother knows what the Grammys are," he says. "And there's
something good about that."</TE>

<HD>Scandals Place Global Spotlight on Bank of China</HD>
<DH>Probe: Questionable loan, theft of millions raise questions
about the ability of the new WTO member to address corruption
problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>What started with a local gossip magazine's investigation of a
celebrity land deal in Southern California has wound up tarnishing
the image of the mainland's leading financial institution, the Bank
of China.</LD>
<LD>   The scandal has toppled one of the stars of the Chinese business
world, resulted in a civil penalty for the bank and raised questions
about China's ability to crack down on corruption now that it's a
member of the World Trade Organization.</LD>
<LD>   The central figure in the affair, Wang Xuebing, is a protege of
Premier Zhu Rongji, and the scandal offers a rare look at the inner
workings of China's state-controlled financial system.</LD>
<TE>   In the 1990s, Wang was hailed as  an example of the country's new
elite. He was handpicked by Zhu in 1993 to head the Bank of China--a
job he held for most of the decade. Westernized, reform-minded and
English-speaking, he seemed to be the state-owned bank's best hope
for reinventing itself for the global economy.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, however, Wang was fired as head of the China
Construction Bank, where he had been transferred about two years ago.
According to auditors in China and the United States, the Bank of
China had misallocated millions of dollars under his watch.</TE>
<TE>   Among the questionable actions was a $23-million loan uncovered by
Hong Kong weekly Next Magazine in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew there's a tremendous amount of hanky-panky going on in
China, and the corruption goes all the way to the top," said Next
Magazine Publisher Yeung Wai Hong.</TE>
<TE>   According to the magazine, a Taiwanese singer and his actress wife
had bought 26 parcels of land in Riverside County for $1.65 million.
They used the land to secure a loan from the Bank of China's Los
Angeles branch for $23 million.</TE>
<TE>   They received the loan allegedly because of a cozy relationship
with Wang's wife, Zong Lulu, who later acquired a stake in the
property.</TE>
<TE>   "If she wasn't his [Wang's] wife, then she wouldn't stand a chance
of getting that kind of money," Yeung said.</TE>
<TE>   The $23 million was never repaid by the borrowers. Instead,
investigators later confirmed, the bank's New York branch made up the
shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   The bank initially dismissed the allegations and threatened to sue
the magazine over the report. Bank officials said the publication had
no credibility, partly because its owner, Jimmy Lai, is a known China
basher.</TE>
<TE>   But last month, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
announced it had completed a two-year investigation and uncovered
numerous cases of misconduct during Wang's tenure.  Chinese banking
authorities agreed to pay a $20-million penalty to both U.S. and
Chinese regulators.</TE>
<TE>   In a much bigger case that's still unfolding, authorities are
investigating the theft of $480 million from a branch in Guangdong,
China, over the course of a decade and are looking for branch
employees who allegedly fled to Canada with about $73 million. Wang
had been their supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the evolving scandal probably could not be worse.</TE>
<TE>   China is in its first year as a member of the WTO and must prove
it can rein in rampant corruption. In addition, the Bank of China's
Hong Kong subsidiary is planning to go public and have its shares
listed on the New York and Hong Kong stock exchanges. That would be a
first for a Chinese state bank.</TE>
<TE>   Some China observers said this airing of dirty laundry, as
embarrassing as it is, could help the bank's proposed initial public
offering. It demonstrates Beijing's resolve to eliminate bad
elements, no matter how well-connected to  top Communist leaders they
may be.</TE>
<TE>   But others worry that the scandal is another reminder that
state-owned enterprises in China might be risky investments. To these
observers, the lack of checks and balances and the meddling of the
Communist Party are signs that such businesses can never achieve true
independence or make profits.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese banks, in particular, are notorious for nonperforming
loans. They are burdened with having to support bankrupt state-owned
companies with sums that often are not repaid.</TE>
<TE>   The Bank of China is supposed to be the best managed of the
nation's four major state banks. Its Hong Kong subsidiary's  bad loan
rate is about 30%, compared with what is believed to be 40% or more
for other Chinese banks. But that is still far above the roughly 6%
average for banks in the former British colony.</TE>
<TE>   "We shouldn't be too surprised somebody took $20 million here or
$70 million there. It's just part of the system," said Gordon G.
Chang, an American lawyer and author of "The Coming Collapse of
China."</TE>
<TE>   Reform is critical, analysts said, to maintain the confidence of
China's depositors, who have had little choice but to keep nearly
$1trillion of their savings in state-owned banks.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of its entry into the WTO, China's banking sector must
be opened to foreign competition within five years.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the country is in the midst of a political power
struggle. Beijing is preparing for a major changing of the guard this
fall, when the country's top brass, from president to premier, will
be replaced.</TE>
<TE>   New leadership in Beijing is likely to trigger more probes of
corruption, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be more and more scandals this year," said Lam Pun
Lee, economics professor at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. "The
different factions within the party will use the media to gain
support and create a negative picture of the other side."</TE>

<HD>Japan's Firms Offer More Hope Than Its Politicians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES FLANIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush is visiting over the next three days a country that,
despite being one of America's closest allies, is said by many
experts to pose a greater threat to the global economy than the Al
Qaeda terrorist network.</LD>
<LD>   The country is Japan, which has stagnated economically for the
last decade and is in a cycle of deflation, with prices by some
expert estimates declining 4% a year. Loans are going bad faster than
banks can write them off as the value of property and business assets
decline, creating a debt crisis worse than the U.S. savings and loan
debacle of the 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   Japan's crisis is everyone's problem. If Japan cannot end
deflation and rejuvenate the banking system, its massive
economy--more than $4trillion in annual output of goods and
services--could be like a black hole, sucking back investments from
overseas and closing down production in thousands of facilities
around the world.</LD>
<TE>   For the present, Japan is muddling through. Hurried moves to deal
with the crisis, such as a proposed infusion of public money to the
banks, are boosting the stock market and strengthening the yen.</TE>
<TE>   In the longer term, the outlook is better. Some of Japan's
companies are recovering the drive and determination that made them
hallmarks of world industry in the 1970s and '80s. More than in the
past, Japan's skilled corporations are investing overseas,
restructuring at home and demonstrating a willingness to work with
others to pursue ventures in technology. They may hold the key to
Japan's future.</TE>
<TE>   But right now the economy is in its third recession in a decade.
The country once famous for lifetime employment admits to an
unemployment rate of 5.6%, but the figure is close to 8.5% on a basis
comparable to U.S. measures of joblessness.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's government debt, after a decade of political paralysis, is
far greater as a percentage of its economy than the United States'
national debt.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's government bonds may be downgraded by Moody's Investors
Service. And experts say there is a risk of a run on the banks at the
close of Japan's fiscal year, March 31, when the government cuts back
on deposit insurance.</TE>
<TE>   A Moody's downgrade wouldn't have much effect because Japan owes
very little debt to foreigners, but "this is a critical time and a
downgrade could spur foreigners to sell assets in Japan," further
hurting the weakened banks, says bond expert Bill Gross of Pacific
Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   For all its troubles, Japan is not a poor country. It is the
largest creditor to the world, investing $800 billion in overseas
bond and stock markets last year in addition to $450 billion in
direct investment abroad in factories, office buildings and real
estate.</TE>
<TE>   Experts are asking whether Japan can go from deflation to
inflation through a government program of setting up a publicly
funded entity to take over the banks' bad loans, as the Resolution
Trust Corp. did in the aftermath of the U.S. savings and loan crisis,
and by increasing the money supply to boost consumer spending. Japan
has done that in the past, notably in the 1920s under a Keynesian
finance minister, Takahashi Korekiyo.</TE>
<TE>   However, pursuing such policies requires political will, and
Japan's central problem over the last decade has been a lack of
decision making by leaders within the majority party that is
controlled by special interests. Longtime experts in Japan's politics
don't see that system reforming itself soon.</TE>
<TE>   That's why it is a good idea to look at Japan's companies--they
are being forced to change to survive.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Home Market Is Facing a Struggle</TE>
<TE>   Only a decade ago, when they were seen as unbeatable in global
competition, Japan's companies had two things going for them. One was
a home market that provided a source of steady profits, coupled with
low-priced government finance.</TE>
<TE>   But now the home market is very weak, and borrowing money--even at
no-interest or 1% rates--is very expensive in a time of deflation,
when companies' plants and equipment are losing value daily.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Japan's largest companies, even though they have worldwide
name recognition, have remained dependent on that home market: About
60% of Toshiba Corp.'s sales and 76% of Hitachi Ltd.'s sales come
from inside Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's biggest companies are restructuring, moving production
facilities to China to avoid paying some of the highest wages in the
industrial world and trying to cope with huge, unfunded pension
liabilities for the employees who are entering retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Much is changing. Annual reports now boast of rising returns on
shareholders' equity.</TE>
<TE>   "Three years ago those companies said they could never run a
company on principles of return on shareholders' equity," says
analyst Steven Myers of HSBC Securities in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Demands from investment companies charged with earning a return
for pension funds have contributed to the change in corporate
attitude.</TE>
<TE>   But Japan's companies were never merely creatures of cheap finance
and favorable government policies. Their more-lasting assets were
disciplined, innovative manufacturing, a focus on product development
and often long-term vision.</TE>
<TE>   Many companies are on top of their industries worldwide, Myers
says. He cites little-known specialty companies such as Disco Corp.,
Murata Manufacturing and Advantest, all makers of electronic
equipment, and better known firms such as Canon Inc. and Ricoh Co.
and Kyocera Corp. as examples of continued excellence in Japanese
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Kyocera, a ceramics company founded in 1959, has become a global
maker of semiconductor materials, mobile telephones, computer parts
and solar energy cells.</TE>
<TE>   Founder Kazuo Inamori boasts of Kyocera's ventures in China, where
it has three factories and is forming a joint venture with China
Zhenhua Science Group to produce and sell telephones that use the
code division multiple access, or CDMA, a technology devised by
Qualcomm Corp. of San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Kyocera, which gets 60% of its $10 billion in sales outside Japan,
has made itself into a multinational company.</TE>
<TE>   "Many Japanese managements have been lax and lazy," Inamori says.
"But today we have new opportunities in China and other countries."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of Strength in Nation's Industries</TE>
<TE>   No one doubts the abilities of Japan's auto and consumer
electronics giants Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co., Sony Corp.
and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., which have spread their
operations to every continent. And in the last two years, Nissan
Motor Co. has demonstrated how quickly a Japanese giant can turn
around.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's management, labor and government establishment allowed
Renault of France to make a controlling investment in Nissan in 1999
and then allowed Renault's Carlos Ghosn to change operations, reduce
staff and turn record profits after years of losses.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Nissan is bringing out new models and expanding output in the
United States, where all Japanese car makers are increasing
production.</TE>
<TE>   A new sense of global competitiveness among most Japanese
companies won't happen overnight, but they are pursuing it with
determination. Takashi Kiuchi, a senior executive of Mitsubishi
Group, founded a consulting firm in Tokyo a year ago to help 18 large
and small companies develop an understanding of new technology and
global alliances.</TE>
<TE>   "We target the year 2010, trying to position our clients in our
society eight years from now," says Kiuchi, who led Mitsubishi
Electronics in Southern California for many years.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese universities from Osaka and Tokyo are joining other
universities in Asia and the Americas--including USC and UC Santa
Barbara--in exploring such U.S.-style concepts as technology transfer
from college laboratories to entrepreneurial companies.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese researchers will join specialists from UCLA, USC and
local companies in a nano-technology conference Friday in Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   It all adds up to a new energy and openness by Japanese industry.
In this decade, we can expect to see Japanese firms behaving like
U.S. and European multinationals, attuned to global investment
markets, building up operations in many countries while turning to
management and service industries in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "Japanese investment could be a big factor in China becoming a
manufacturing superpower," says Kenneth Courtis, head of Asian
research for Goldman Sachs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Politics, Economy Pose Immediate Problems</TE>
<TE>   Yet the outlook for energetic companies does not answer today's
question of whether Japan can reform its political system and
rejuvenate its economy.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence is not promising. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi,
who was hailed as a reformer when he took office two years ago, has
fired his foreign minister because she angered powerful interests in
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.</TE>
<TE>   "That shows he can't buck the special interests and there will be
no real reform in Japan at this time," says Frank Gibney, head of the
Pacific Basin Institute at Pomona College and a veteran of decades of
doing business in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, an alternative to reform that is openly talked about in
Japan is "comfortable decline"--a concept of a wealthy nation with an
aging population living on the capital it built up in years of
greater industrial dynamism.</TE>
<TE>   Mitsubishi Chairman Minoru Makihara acknowledged the concept in an
interview, saying, "Japan would withdraw into itself and people would
be comfortable for a time. But I fear that pressures from the outside
would make it unpleasant before long."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, pressures are building inside and outside Japan. That is
why there is such concern about the latest recession and banking
crisis. Inside the economy, there is the rising pressure of pensions,
with the number of retirees expected to grow as companies restructure
and downsize their work force, says economist Adam Posen of the
Institute for International Economics in Washington. Japan's problem
is acute because its pension funds have earned returns of only 1% to
2% on investments in Japanese government bonds in recent decades.</TE>
<TE>   And outside pressures could come from developments in Asia, which
Japan has led economically and technologically for well over a
century.</TE>
<TE>   "The rise of China, uncertainty concerning reunification of the
Korean peninsula and its relations with the United States pose major
questions for Japan," wrote former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Michael
Armacost and Kenneth Pyle of the University of Washington in a report
for the Seattle-based National Bureau of Asian Research.</TE>
<TE>   China particularly is critical because its rising economic and
military power could "eclipse Japan in the Asian region," says
Charles Wolf, senior advisor at Rand Corp. Recognition of their
country's declining position could so shock the Japanese that the
society would see an upheaval recalling the Meiji restoration in the
19th century.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf is referring to a central event in Japanese history, when the
nation in the 1870s recognized how far Western technology had moved
ahead of it. The nation committed itself to modernization and began
the long march to industrial, technological and military leadership
of Asia and economic preeminence in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Bush will get no quick answers during his visit this week to
Japan, which will be followed by stops in South Korea and China. But
even in the questions about Japan's crisis, he will learn about
rapidly moving currents that will affect every economy and nation on
Earth.</TE>

<LD>It was only a few months ago that gas cost about $2 a gallon, so how

to the brief $1-a-gallon cost ["Region's Gas Price Hikes Expected to
Slow," Feb 2]?</LD>
<LD>   It is ludicrous to expect gas prices to do anything but fluctuate
a lot, but eventually increase as world supplies decrease, our
consumption increases, and local refining is limited by (reasonable)
pollution controls.</LD>

<LD>Conrad Giedt's assertion that practically all financial statements
today are misleading is itself misleading ["CPAs Responsible for
Enron Crisis," Letters, Feb. 3].</LD>
<LD>   In fact, most financial statements are reliable and give a true
picture of the financial status of the companies that produce them.
It may be true that, due to the increased sophistication and
complexity of modern business, financial statements are more opaque
than they should be. And there may in fact be instances in which that
opacity is purposeful.</LD>
<LD>   I also feel compelled to point out that whatever shenanigans may
be going on in financial reporting, in most cases the primary
culprits are corporate officers and their boards. Senior management
and boards of directors are well aware and regularly acknowledge in
writing that they have primary responsibility for the veracity of
financial reports. Management and boards of directors make the final
decisions about how their companies will ultimately be portrayed in
financial reports, not auditors.</LD>
<TE>   As for the auditors, their responsibility is also clear. Where
they find wrongdoing or inaccuracy, their duty is to report it to
management and demand corrections. If management won't change the
statements, the auditor must resign the engagement. Whenever this
standard is breached, the auditor should be disciplined.</TE>

<TE>   I found Mr. Giedt's letter to be an interesting perspective on the
Enron debacle. Like Mr. Giedt, I have also practiced in public and
private accounting since the early 1970s. For many years, auditing
has been a loss-leader for other services offered by public
accounting firms. One can easily make the argument that artificially
low fees lead to substandard work.</TE>
<TE>   CPAs have been concerned about cost cutting for some time.
Unfortunately, it takes the cooperation of all of the public
accounting firms to ensure that this practice stops.</TE>

<LD>I believe in cooperating in every way to prevent identity theft and

<LD>   What I am not willing to do is assume the responsibility of the
banks, credit card companies and others that give my credit to
impostors posing as me. There should be no risk to an innocent person
because someone erroneously extends credit in his or her name.</LD>
<LD>   A Social Security card is not identification. Read the card. If a
bank is authorized to extend credit or pay a check on an individual's
signature, any mistake made in that simple process is between the
bank and the impostor. Why on earth should someone not involved in
the transaction have to prove their innocence?</LD>
<TE>   One unacceptable answer to that question is that there is an undue
level of banks and credit card companies making law and policy on
this subject. They are unreasonably aided by the three major credit
reporting agencies that stand ready to ruin anyone's credit if a
lender wants them to. Their participation is perfectly legal under
the Fair Credit Reporting Act.</TE>
<TE>   "Fair"? If you or I were to do it, it would be called extortion,
libel or blackmail. In a dispute, the credit agencies will demand
proof from you and me but after receiving the proof, they will simply
ask the reporting creditor if the item should be removed. All it
takes is a negative answer and the extortion (legal though it is)
will continue until we are exhausted enough to give in and pay. Have
you checked your credit report lately?</TE>

<HD>Bankruptcy Filing Makes It Tough to Get a Home Loan</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I am planning to buy the house I currently rent. The
problem is that I am still in bankruptcy. How long do I need to wait
after my bankruptcy is discharged to start the purchase? Would I
suffer a high interest rate? I have been making rent payments for
almost two years. Would lenders consider that?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Would you lend money to you, given your record?</LD>
<LD>   Lenders consider many factors when making a loan, and chief among
them is your history of paying debts. People who bail on their bills,
as you did when you filed for bankruptcy, don't tend to win lenders'
hearts.</LD>
<TE>   The fact that you don't really understand this means that you</TE>
<TE>filed for bankruptcy without taking the time to find out
what it would do to your credit and the rest of your financial life.</TE>
<TE>   Bankruptcy trashes your credit rating. It will make getting credit
much more expensive, and will remain on your credit history for as
long as 10 years. You may be able to find a lender within a couple of
years that would be willing to lend you money to buy a house, but
you'll pay a much higher interest rate than other borrowers.</TE>
<TE>   You also could try working directly with the home's owner. If the
owner doesn't need money up front and is willing to trust you to make
the payments, he or she could become your mortgage lender.</TE>
<TE>   If not, you'll have to resign yourself to renting--and rebuilding
your credit--for a few more years. You might check out "Money
Troubles: Legal Strategies to Cope With Your Debts" by Robin Leonard
and Deanne Loonin (Nolo Press, 2001).</TE>

<TE>   Taking the First Steps to Living Debt-Free</TE>
<TE>   Q: Your advice to the couple that was about to spend $20,000 on a
wedding, when they were already $18,000 in debt, really struck a
chord with me. You pointed out the huge cost of living in debt. You
also said that if you have to use credit to pay for something that
won't appreciate in value, then you can't afford it. Thank you for
saying these things. You have really inspired me to get out of debt.</TE>
<TE>   A: Good for you for taking the first steps toward debt-free
living. You'll find living without debt is much happier, less
stressful and ultimately more rewarding than living with the crush of
credit card bills.</TE>
<TE>   If you want more encouragement, you can find plenty of great books
on getting out of debt at your local library. One to try: "Invest in
Yourself: Six Secrets to a Rich Life" by Marc Eisenson, Nancy
Castleman and Gerri Detweiler (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1998).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Avoid Viaticals Like the Plague</TE>
<TE>   Q: I just read your advice regarding viatical investments, and it
was not strong enough. Tell anyone who asks about this type of
investment to run as far away as possible from viaticals and the
people who sell them. I made an investment in a viatical policy and
to date I have lost well over $20,000. I have reported the company to
the Better Business Bureau and the attorney general's office, to no
avail. Oh, and lest you think I did this on my own--no, I went
through a financial planner. He has long since moved on and has been
absolutely no help whatsoever. If I could save one person from not
investing in these I would consider it my accomplishment for the
year.</TE>
<TE>   A: Yours is certainly a testimonial to the risks involved in
investing in viaticals, which are life insurance policies purchased
from the terminally ill. Although there is a legitimate market in
these investments, there also is a lot of fraud, as well as plenty of
uncertainty about when the investments will ''mature''--in other
words, when the terminally ill person will die.</TE>
<TE>   Your job as whistleblower isn't quite done, however. There's a
good chance your financial advisor was licensed to sell financial
products--either securities or insurance or both. You should file a
complaint with the appropriate regulator.</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Securities Dealers regulates brokers
nationally, while your state insurance department disciplines agents.
Your state's insurance department will be listed in the blue pages of
your phone book, and you can contact the NASD at www.nasdr.com.</TE>

<HD>Proposals for 401(k) Reform Fall Short</HD>
<DH>Investing: Many experts say plans in Congress don't address
broader key issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Enron meltdown has put 401(k) reform at the top of Congress'
agenda, but experts say the proposed remedies don't address many of
the shortcomings of the suddenly controversial retirement plans, such
as low worker participation and high fees charged by plan
administrators.</LD>
<LD>   "This whole debate [in Congress] is reactionary to Enron. It is
not in any way strategic," said Dallas Salisbury, president of the
Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington. "It is not in any
way focused on what we should do about retirement policy."</LD>
<LD>   When Enron's stock collapsed last year, many workers who had
overloaded their 401(k) accounts with Enron stock lost the bulk of
their retirement savings. In the wake of that debacle, 14 bills have
been proposed or introduced in the last several weeks, all aimed at
patching up the 401(k)--a 20-year-old retirement savings system that
allows workers to set aside savings in tax-deferred accounts.</LD>
<TE>   The various proposals--including one put forth by President
Bush--focus on providing workers better education about the
intricacies of investing, as well as setting standards for so-called
lockdown periods, when participants are barred from transferring
401(k) balances from one type of investment to another. Some
lawmakers also want to limit the amount of retirement money workers
can invest in company stock and how long they can be required to hold
company stock they receive as a matching contribution from their
employer.</TE>
<TE>   But the problems with 401(k) plans go beyond what is being debated
on Capitol Hill, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "You are putting up legislative mandates to fix one thing and you
are ignoring the broader context," said Joshua Dietch, consultant
with Cerulli Associates, a Boston-based benefits firm.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, at a time when 401(k) savings are becoming the
primary source of retirement funds for the majority of American
workers, about 20% of eligible workers don't contribute to them,
Dietch said. Many of those of who participate contribute too little,
he said, saving such a small percentage of their pay that it's
unlikely to be amount to much at retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem: A significant number of workers cash out their
401(k) accounts when changing jobs, opting to spend their nest egg
instead of moving it to their new employer's 401(k) plan or rolling
it over to an individual retirement account. This mistake is
especially popular among younger workers--who have the most to gain
from long-term tax-deferred savings.</TE>
<TE>   The people who select investment choices for companies' 401(k)
plans--often employee benefit managers--seldom have a background in
finance and frequently are ill-qualified for the job, retirement
consultant Ted Benna said.</TE>
<TE>   Many plans are filled with mutual funds that feature high fees and
poor results, Benna said--an investment disaster in the making.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, plan administrators often saddle workers with too few
investment choices, or with poorly chosen funds that prevent workers
from properly diversifying their portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   Solutions to some of these problems already are being tested in
the marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   To encourage more people to participate in 401(k) plans, about 6%
of U.S. companies have launched automatic enrollment programs. In a
so-called negative election program, workers are enrolled in their
employers' 401(k) plans unless they opt not to. About 75% of the
companies using negative election plans say they've boosted employee
participation rates, according to benefit consulting firm William M.
Mercer.</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to increase contribution levels, a new program is
being tested in which workers can opt to have future pay raises
automatically invested in their 401(k) plans, said Shlomo Benartzi,
an assistant professor at UCLA who has completed several studies of
how employees handle their 401(k)s. At the mid-size manufacturing
company where it is being tested, Benartzi said, 80% of those who
opted for the program--called Save More Later-- stuck with it through
three pay hikes. The effect on savings rates was dramatic--average
savings rates rose from 3.5% of pay to 11.6% in 28 months.</TE>
<TE>   To address the lack of diversification, or the lack of interest
many workers have in choosing investments, some companies now offer
so-called life cycle funds, which automatically spread a worker's
401(k) savings among stocks, bonds and cash. The percentages vary
depending on the participant's age, savings goals and funds offered.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department also recently approved a proposal by Los
Angeles-based Sun America Corp. to provide full-service investment
advice to 401(k) participants. The plan would allow workers who
didn't want to be responsible for choosing specific investments to
check a box opting for a managed account. The managers would create
an initial asset allocation based on information such as the
participant's age, assets and contribution rate. An advisor would
follow up on a regular basis to make sure the investment mix still
suited the investor.</TE>
<TE>   If the government encouraged companies to adopt these programs, it
could go a long way toward solving some of the problems now besetting
the 401(k) system, investment experts said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, experts are hesitant about proposing legislative
solutions for a practical reason: Companies don't have to offer
401(k) plans--or any other retirement plan. If the rules become too
onerous or boost corporate liability for their workers' retirement
security, some fear companies will abandon their programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Above all else, I would want to tell Congress to take a deep
breath and proceed cautiously," said James Klein, president of the
American Benefits Council in Washington. "We are all still operating
in something of a vacuum in terms of knowing what kind of changes
might have unintended consequences. There are some real dangers
here."</TE>

<HD>Buybacks, Takeovers Slump Amid 'Enronitis'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Among the many casualties of the Enron debacle and its fallout, count
corporate America's appetite for its own paper.</LD>
<LD>   In January, a mere 18 companies announced plans to repurchase
stock, and the total buyback commitment was $1.8 billion, according
to Thomson Financial Securities Data.</LD>
<LD>   Those figures compare with an average of 64 buyback announcements
each month over the last two years and an average total dollar value
of $13.6 billion a month.</LD>
<TE>   So far in February, 11 companies have committed a total of $7.1
billion to repurchase shares. But $5 billion of that was from one
company--Johnson &amp; Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise collapsed is many U.S. companies' urge to merge. Deals
worth $21.1 billion were announced in January, the weakest activity
for any January since 1994, and a third of the December dollar
volume, according to Thomson Financial.</TE>
<TE>   With February more than half over, the value of deals announced so
far stands at just $10.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The relative dearth of buybacks and takeovers significantly dents
two key sources of demand for stock. Little wonder the market is
struggling this year, after the heady rally of the fourth quarter.
With Friday's sell-off, the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index is
down 3.8% year to date. The Nasdaq composite is off 7.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the spreading firestorm over the trustworthiness of corporate
accounting and increasing doubts about the credibility of management
in general, it isn't a coincidence that stock buybacks and takeovers
have taken a back seat to other concerns since Jan. 1, some Wall
Street pros say.</TE>
<TE>   Company managers typically don't put out news releases to admit
it, but they now may be preoccupied with making sure their balance
sheets and income statements are honest. Others may be trying to
figure out how to explain numbers that no longer pass the smell test,
if they ever did.</TE>
<TE>   After all, this fourth-quarter-earnings reporting season, now
winding down, really is like no other: The Securities and Exchange
Commission is committed to closely reading the 2001 annual reports of
every one of the Fortune 500 companies, the agency announced in late
December.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said its examiners will focus on "disclosure that appears
to be critical to an understanding of each company's financial
position and results, but which, at least on its face, seems to
conflict significantly with generally accepted accounting principles
or Commission rules, or to be materially deficient in explanation or
clarity."</TE>
<TE>   Companies that aren't worried about their accounting may face more
fundamental obstacles to merger deals or buybacks.</TE>
<TE>   One critical issue is financing: In the energy, utility and
telecom sectors, in particular, lenders have become much more
skittish about extending credit, given the mounting concerns about
the legitimacy of companies' financial data.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, telecom giant Qwest Communications International, which
owns the former Baby Bell firm U.S. West, found itself frozen out of
the market for commercial paper, a principal means of short-term
financing. The company was forced to draw down bank lines of credit
worth $4 billion, and said it would look to sell some assets and cut
back capital spending to allay investors' fears about its viability.</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts say there still is no sign of a broad-based credit
crunch in the economy. Even so, "We could be seeing more companies
recognizing that they don't have as much cash as they need to fund
operations" in the near term, said Tom McManus, investment strategist
at Banc of America Securities in New York. That conclusion may be
leading more firms to scale back their ambitions, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many companies, of course, would prefer to pay for takeover deals
using stock rather than cash or loans. But with share prices sliding
again this year, using stock as merger currency becomes less
feasible. Potential acquirers have to give away more equity when
share prices are lower, something they're reluctant to do. And
potential targets become less interested in receiving stock that's in
danger of further devaluation.</TE>
<TE>   The same may be said of corporate executives with regard to their
own shares: One reason companies are buying back fewer shares is that
many of their insiders have stopped exercising stock options, some
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Companies often buy back shares so they can hold them in reserve
and re-release them when employee options are exercised.</TE>
<TE>   When "nobody is exercising options, there's no need to do
buybacks," said Patrick McGurn, corporate programs director for
investor advisory service Institutional Shareholders Service in
Rockville, Md.</TE>
<TE>   One logical reason for corporate insiders to stop exercising
options would be because those options are underwater--meaning the
market price is below the exercise price.</TE>
<TE>   It's also conceivable that insiders whose exercise price is below
their stock's market price are confident their shares will rise in
value this year, meaning they don't feel pressure to exercise the
options and immediately sell the shares.</TE>
<TE>   Apart from supplying options programs, a major motivation behind
stock buybacks in recent years was that companies viewed their shares
as being undervalued in the market.</TE>
<TE>   Using capital to repurchase shares was seen as the best way to
reward shareholders: The buyback programs helped boost stock prices,
while at the same time shrinking the total number of shares
outstanding and thus raising earnings per share calculations.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC even helped abet buybacks after Sept. 11 by relaxing rules
that had restricted some companies' stock-purchase activities. That
fueled a surge in buyback announcements in September.</TE>
<TE>   What has troubled some analysts is that many companies were eager
to go deep into debt to finance their buyback programs in the late
1990s. Worse, in many cases companies were buying shares at levels
far above today's prices. "Replacing equity with debt was considered
a brilliant move," noted Robert Willens, a tax expert at Lehman Bros.
in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Now, that debt is coming back to haunt companies. And some recent
buyback announcements have been poorly received in the market because
of fears that companies risk more harm than good by using cash to
repurchase shares.</TE>
<TE>   Neither McDonald's Corp. nor Johnson &amp; Johnson saw an immediate
lift in their stock prices last week after announcing large buyback
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Garbage hauler Waste Management Inc.'s stock has fallen since Feb.
1, when the company said it may buy back as much as $1 billion of
stock annually. Credit-rating firm Moody's Investors Service reacted
to the company's plans by changing its credit outlook for the firm to
negative from positive--a harsh reminder that financial alchemy that
is glorified in a bull market can be viewed as poisonous when the
wind changes.</TE>

Instead he expressed "profound sadness" about what had happened at

<LD>   Separately, Enron executive Sherron S. Watkins told lawmakers that
Lay was "duped" by top executives and didn't understand the company's
perilous financial state before it filed for bankruptcy.</LD>
<TE>   Watkins testified that former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S.
Fastow tried last fall to fire her after she complained about the
company's accounting practices to Lay. Fastow declined to give
testimony during his appearance before Congress two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, six of Enron's 14 board members resigned as the company
attempts to restructure.</TE>
<TE>   The company also said it would provide Congress with copies of its
tax returns dating to 1985 to aid an inquiry into whether the company
used ''aggressive tax planning'' to avoid paying federal income
taxes. The Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on
Taxation are planning a ''thorough and comprehensive probe.</TE>

<TE>   Airline Mechanics Gear Up for Strike</TE>
<TE>   United Airlines, U.S. officials and travelers are bracing for a
possible strike against the carrier this week by its 10,600
mechanics, who rejected the latest contract offer.</TE>
<TE>   The International Assn. of Machinists, is set to strike Wednesday
if the two sides can't reach an agreement. United and the IAM resumed
bargaining Friday after the mechanics--who haven't had a raise since
1994--voted down an immediate 37% pay hike recommended by an
emergency board appointed by President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The board delayed a mechanics' strike in late December while it
worked out the latest contract proposal. Now, it appears that only
Congress could block a strike. But Congress is in recess and won't
return until Feb. 26, so a mechanics' strike could last for days
before lawmakers could end it.</TE>
<TE>   The threat is causing many passengers to shift to other airlines,
further eroding the financial health of United, which lost $2.1
billion last year.</TE>

<TE>   When Bad News Is Good News</TE>
<TE>   A day after missing out on the gold medal in a controversial
judging decision that has overshadowed everything else at the Winter
Olympics, Canadian figure skaters Jamie Sale and David Pelletier were
getting urgent calls from reporters, talk-show hosts and assorted
deal makers.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the duo was awarded the gold by week's end, their
long-term commercial success still is not assured; their names could
be added to the lengthy list of talented skating couples who were
overshadowed by the more glamorous women's singles competition.</TE>
<TE>   The sports marketing pie for the Winter Games, traditionally
smaller than that for the Summer Games, also has been reduced by the
recession and post-attack advertising cutbacks.</TE>

<TE>   Did 'Miss Cleo' See It Coming?</TE>
<TE>   The brief TV career of "Miss Cleo" is coming to an end amid
allegations that the psychic hotline advertised by the Caribbean
clairvoyant scammed consumers out of millions of dollars with false
promises of free readings.</TE>
<TE>   In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., the Federal Trade Commission accused two telemarketing firms of
using deceptive tactics to lure callers to the hotline, which
provides psychic readings at a cost of $4.99 a minute.</TE>
<TE>   Psychic Readers Network Inc. and Access Resources Services Inc.
used the pseudonymous Miss Cleo in their nationwide TV ads,
infomercials and mailings.</TE>
<TE>   The FTC said the hotline in recent years has been the subject of
about 2,000 consumer complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the firms complained that the FTC had refused to
discuss the allegations before filing its complaint, choosing to try
the firms in the media. The commission "apparently was unwilling to
allow the truth to compromise a good headline," they said.</TE>
<TE>   "To say we're being deceptive is just plain wrong and unfair,"
said Peter Stolz, president of the two telemarketing firms, adding
that "99.999% [of customers] are happy with the service."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Homestore Is Where the Restatement Is</TE>
<TE>   Homestore.com Inc. said it would restate its 2000 financial
results and file new numbers by mid-March, fueling analysts' doubts
about the viability of the Westlake Village company.</TE>
<TE>   The news prompted the Nasdaq Stock Market to halt trading of the
Internet home-listing service's shares until it satisfies the
exchange's request for additional information. The share price was 72
cents when trading was halted.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore already had said it would restate financial results for
the first, second and third quarters of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The newest restatements involve historical accounting issues and
do not relate to Homestore's ongoing operations, Chief Executive
Michael Long said. But that explanation was not enough to convince
analysts that Homestore will be viable in the long term.</TE>

<TE>   You've Got E-Mail Scam Crackdown</TE>
<TE>   In the first of a series of planned government crackdowns on junk
e-mail schemes, the Federal Trade Commission announced actions
against one of the most widely distributed get-rich-quick scams.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail, which promised recipients they could "Be a millionaire
like others within a year!" on a $25 investment, is an illegal chain
letter ruse. Seven people caught last year in an agency sting agreed
to a federal court judgment that required them to return future funds
gained from the scheme.</TE>
<TE>   The FTC also said it had sent warning letters to 2,000 other
people allegedly involved in distributing the e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   FTC officials said they are serious about pursuing e-mail scams,
but they acknowledge it's an uphill battle. The agency has only 271
investigators to examine all types of commercial claims nationwide,
online or otherwise. Some computer users get at least that many
unsolicited e-mail offers each week.</TE>

<TE>   Putting New Spin on an Old Toy</TE>
<TE>   Several toy makers and major retailers are betting that the
Japanese craze for toy tops will be the next kids' sensation in the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The new toys, unveiled last week at the annual International Toy
Fair in New York, are to traditional spinners what Razor scooters
were to the wheeled wooden platforms that came before them.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of most of the new top games is the same: to be the last
one standing. What's different are the added features and accessories
to help get the tops going, keep them spinning and aid their ability
to knock down other players' tops.</TE>
<TE>   Also during Toy Fair, Lego Co., the Danish toy maker best known
for its brightly colored interlocking bricks, said it was moving into
a new dimension with the introduction of several action figures.
Based on the Fox Kids show "Galidor: Defenders of the Outer
Dimension," which debuted this month, Lego's line of 20 moving
figures is part of the company's efforts to broaden its product line.</TE>

<TE>   $140 Million Is Music to Dick Clark's Ears</TE>
<TE>   Pop icon Dick Clark reached an agreement to sell his independent
television production company, which produces such shows as "Dick
Clark's New Year's Rockin Eve" and the "Golden Globe Awards," to a
group of private investors for $140 million.</TE>
<TE>   Clark, 72, will remain chairman and chief executive of the company
that he formed in 1957--the year his "American Bandstand" made the
leap from a local Philadelphia production to a national audience on
ABC.</TE>
<TE>   The investors acquiring Dick Clark Productions Inc. include Mosaic
Media Group, Capital Communications CDPQ Inc. and entertainment
industry veteran Jules Haimovitz.</TE>
<TE>   The partners agreed to pay $14.50 a share in cash to shareholders,
with the intent of taking the company private. Clark will receive
$12.50 a share, making his holdings worth nearly $95 million.</TE>

<TE>   Global Crossing Still Making Waves</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing Ltd. stayed in the headlines all week, as the
company made plans to move out of its Beverly Hills headquarters, and
news emerged that Chief Executive John Legere was paid as much as $3
million in severance for making the move to Global Crossing from his
position as CEO of subsidiary Asia Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Legere and Global Crossing founders Gary Winnick and Lodwrick
Cook, all silent since the company filed for bankruptcy protection
last month, sent missives to employees acknowleding that the
bankruptcy has been hard for employees but that the move to
Bankruptcy Court is the "best way to preserve our wonderful company."</TE>

<LD>Art for AIDS</LD>
<LD>   With Elizabeth Taylor and Michael Jackson as featured guests, AIDS
Services Foundation Orange County and the Laguna Art Museum presented
its first joint benefit event, "Art for Aids, A Tribute to Rock
Hudson."</LD>
<LD>   The two-tiered benefit included a $2,500-per-plate sit-down dinner
for 40 guests in a private home and a $125-per-ticket supper and live
auction for hundreds at the museum. The event netted $200,000, to be
divided equally between the museum and AIDS foundation.</LD>
<TE>   Taylor and Jackson arrived fashionably late at the dinner--filet
mignon and raspberry souffle whipped up by Mark's restaurant--staged
in the art-filled home of Barbara Alexander Stiles and Thomas B.
Stiles II. "Elizabeth, the party was last night," guest Merv Griffin
quipped upon the star's arrival.</TE>
<TE>   With Jackson standing quietly at her side, the violet-eyed actress
mingled briefly with fans before being whisked by limousine to the
museum. There, she stood before a sold-out crowd, praising her friend
Rock Hudson, who died of AIDS in 1985, and pledging her ongoing
support for AIDS research and patient services. "I, for one, will
never stop my personal fight against AIDS, and I ask the same of
you."</TE>
<TE>   The Feb. 9 tribute to Hudson, a frequent visitor to Laguna Beach,
seemed like a natural, observed Beverly Hills dermatologist Arnold
Klein, co-chairman of the benefit with Jack Kenefick and Al Roberts.
"Rock was grateful that the AIDS Services Foundation was being
founded [in 1985]. And Elizabeth has been a driving force for
fund-raising."</TE>
<TE>   Guests also included Penny Marshall; Ken Jillson; Jose Eber; Mark
De Palma; Anita May Rosenstein; David Canzoneri; Santina Davies; Ray
and Beverly Redfern; and Mark and Donna Merhab.</TE>

<TE>   Gypsy Awards</TE>
<TE>   Stars of two eras of dance--June Haver, who made her mark in film
musicals in the 40s, and Gregory Hines, currently making his mark on
stage and screen--were honored by their peers, the members of the
Professional Dancers Society.</TE>
<TE>   More than 600 guests packed the Beverly Hilton ballroom for the
16th Gypsy Awards Luncheon, which netted $80,000.</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds from the annual event, named in honor of the frequently
unheralded chorus singers and dancers affectionately known in show
business as "gypsies," are earmarked for dancers in need. The society
is currently associated with Actors Fund of America, which disburses
its funds for housing, financial aid and medical care.</TE>
<TE>   In accepting the award, presented by past honoree Mitzi Gaynor,
Haver recalled her first dancing lesson in Rock Island, Ill. "The
teacher told me, 'We're going to do a Gypsy number. Here's your
tambourine!' Now over 50 years later I am a gypsy." Haver announced
that she will donate $10,000 yearly for the next 10 years for a dance
scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   When Tony Danza presented Hines with his award, Hines said it was
the most important award to him because "it comes from our own.
Whenever I have to fill out a form that asks my profession, I proudly
write 'tap dancer.'"</TE>
<TE>   Joni Berry, chairwoman of the society board presided over last
Sunday's program, which included a tribute to the career of Busby
Berkeley, featuring Esther Williams. Lee Hale, Alan Johnson and
Miriam Nelson produced and directed the show, which included a film
retrospective of the honorees' careers; a performance by tap dancer
Mark Mendoza; the jazz ensemble from UC Irvine; and the Doug Caldwell
Dancers. Others on the scene included John Byner, Dom DeLuise, Rip
Taylor, Phyllis Diller, Jane Withers, Jack Carter, Cyd Charisse, Tony
Martin, Barbara Billingsley and Jayne Meadows.</TE>

<TE>   Schuur Thing</TE>
<TE>   After jazz vocalist Diane Schuur was awarded the Walter Knott
Service Award during a luncheon benefit for Goodwill Industries of
Orange County, she sat at a grand piano to perform a stirring
rendition of "Amazing Grace."</TE>
<TE>   The two-time Grammy Award winner was recognized for outstanding
achievement along with Expressionist artist Dan Keplinger and Anaheim
Angels broadcaster Rex Hudler. Schuur, blind since birth, told 350
guests she was "thrilled to be honored" by an organization that helps
promote independence for people with disabilities. Cingular Wireless
was also saluted for its service to people with disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds of more than $100,000 from the Feb. 7 event will be used
for Goodwill's education, training and employment programs for
disabled children and adults.</TE>

<TE>   Kids Initiative</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver were guests of honor at a
benefit attended by 100 people at Chapman University that netted
about $650,000 in support of a proposed ballot initiative supported
by the actor, the After School Education and Safety Program Act of
2002.</TE>
<TE>   "Arnold is sponsoring this initiative to ensure that all grade and
middle schoolchildren in California have access to after-school
programs," said Paul Folino, president and chief executive officer of
Emulex Corp. in Costa Mesa, underwriter of the Feb. 1 event. "With
60% to 70% of California parents working full time, there is a big
gap in supervision for kids between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m."</TE>

<TE>   Pasadena Symphony</TE>
<TE>   The ballroom of Pasadena's Ritz-Carlton, Huntington Hotel looked
like a dress-extra call for "That Night in Rio," with an assortment
of Carmen Miranda types in the crowd of more than 350 who turned out
for the Pasadena Symphony benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Copacabana-style dancers greeted guests with beads and feather
boas; florist Jacob Maarse created fruit and flower table
centerpieces reminiscent of Miranda's headdresses. The "taste of
Brazil" dinner included Brazilian nut soup and grilled salmon with
coconut pineapple sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds from the Feb. 9 event and its silent auction will exceed
$150,000. Among the revelers were co-chairmen Mary Ann Jenkins and
Jim Watterson; Alyce and Spud Williamson, the event's major
benefactors; and Debra Paterson, vice-president of Wells Fargo, a
major symphony supporter. Other guests included George Martin, Gerri
Lee Frye, Gretchen and Graham Lewis, Betty and Frank Whiting,
Georgianna and Paul Erskine, Elaine and Jim Mramor, Jane and David
Stover, Michelle and Roger Engemann.</TE>

<TE>   'Into the Woods'</TE>
<TE>   After last Sunday's opening of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's
"Into the Woods" at the Ahmanson Theatre, the theater crowd gathered
to celebrate with the cast at buffet tables around the Music Center
Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   The Patina chefs at the Music Center took their cue from the
show's fairy-tale plot: The "Cinderella" buffet (pumpkin soup) was
decorated with pumpkins and slippers; a cheese tower topped with
flowing angel-hair pasta and bakery breads was on the "Rupunzel and
Baker's" table; "Jack and the Beanstalk's" stop had "magic beans"
(chili) and golden (deviled) eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Guests included Charlotte Rae from the show's original touring
company, Gregory Harrison, Angela Lansbury, Doris Roberts, Loni
Anderson, Adrienne Barbeau, Angela Bassett, Swoosie Kurtz, Anne
Heche, Shirley Jones, Marty Ingels, Robert Morse, Linda Purl, Lesley
Ann Warren and JoAnne Worley.</TE>

<LD>Danny Biederman watched nervously as the museum curator slipped
Maxwell Smart's shoe phone carefully into place, only a few feet away
from Emma Peel's famed leather pants.</LD>
<LD>   Off in the corner was the tarantula that almost did in James Bond
in "Dr. No." Austin Powers' dorky black-framed glasses were already
under plexiglass on the other side of the room.</LD>
<LD>   This is Biederman's fleeting moment of fame, as all those years of
collecting Hollywood spy memorabilia has landed him in the august
halls of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum, near Simi
Valley. He's there in the company of the CIA, the National Archives
and Florida's H. Keith Melton, perhaps the world's foremost collector
of spook devices. All have contributed to a five-month exhibition
about spies, which opens today.</LD>
<TE>   To look at Biederman's collection at the Gipper's library is to
return to a different time, when Bill Cosby and Robert Culp thwarted
evil in between tennis matches ("I Spy"), and Robert Vaughn got his
marching orders after slipping into Del Floria's Tailor Shop ("The
Man From U.N.C.L.E.").</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first time Biederman's show-biz artifacts have been
on display, but it's the first time someone without security
clearance can look at them. Two years ago, the CIA brought the best
of Biederman's collection to its Langley, Va., headquarters for the
entertainment of its operatives, but the general public was not on
the guest list.</TE>
<TE>   And though the timing is purely coincidental, Reagan library
director Duke Blackwood said the display couldn't be more
appropriate, given the spotlight these days on the
intelligence-gathering community. "The reality is that we're paying a
lot more attention to it now," he said. "We feel it's very
important."</TE>
<TE>   And from Biederman's point of view, the collection is a return to
the '60s, when the Commies were the enemy, when each television
evening offered a spy thriller or spoof, and Sean Connery was James
Bond.</TE>
<TE>   "It's taking people back," said Biederman, a screenwriter who also
acts as a consultant for movie and television spy fiction. "It's like
therapy."</TE>
<TE>   In all, Biederman has more than 4,000 pieces in his collection,
ranging from the famous shoe phone ("Get Smart"), to Emma Peel's
pants in "The Avengers" to an original script from "The Man From
U.N.C.L.E." (original working title: "Solo," as in the character
Napoleon Solo).</TE>
<TE>   Biederman said it was that show, with its gadgetry, fancy weapons
and utter coolness that hooked him on the celluloid spy scene when he
was 10 years old. He started making his own spy gadgets, including
"smokescreen spy shoes" for quick getaways. These had heels filled
with magic-shop smoke powder connected to a fuse. ("I think if I'd
ever used them once, I wouldn't be here today," said Biederman.)</TE>
<TE>   Then, in high school, he began making his own 8-millimeter movies.
In 1969, while still in his teens, he talked his way onto the set of
"Diamonds Are Forever," Connery's sixth and final Bond flick, after
convincing gatekeepers he was working on a documentary film.</TE>
<TE>   "I pulled it off," said Biederman. "That was a high point for me
as a teenager."</TE>
<TE>   Even as he was making films, Biederman was collecting most
anything associated with the spy craze. James Bond cologne was a
must-have. So were the teen magazines that might have had the Beatles
on the cover but also contained features about "U.N.C.L.E."'s Vaughn
and his mop-headed sidekick, David McCallum as Illya Kuryakin.</TE>
<TE>   Another defining moment for Biederman came in 1971, when he
attended an auction in which a cash-strapped MGM was selling off
studio props. Among the items were T.H.R.U.S.H. (arch nemesis of
U.N.C.L.E.) uniforms. With the $25 he had in his pocket, Biederman
managed to buy a few small T.H.R.U.S.H. artifacts, thereby beginning
the first serious chapter in his collecting life.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe it," he said. "I realized I could get the
stuff I saw on the television shows."</TE>
<TE>   The years rolled on, and the collection grew. Among other items he
located was the sleeve gun from "The Wild Wild West," as well as
Napoleon Solo's cigarette-case transmitter and radio pen. Most of it
was found through his film connections, who often knew of spy props
stuck away in attics or garages.</TE>
<TE>   While Biederman keeps some of his collection at home, the majority
of it is warehoused in several locations around Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I just started picking up stuff," he said, seated in the living
room of his Calabasas hills home with the soundtracks from spy shows
playing in the background. "Then people saw that I was serious and so
passionate about the shows; they tended to donate these things to me
because they knew I would give it a good home."</TE>
<TE>   At some point in the process, Biederman located The Shoe, then
tried for years to obtain it. Remember Maxwell Smart pulling off the
sole of his shoe to reveal a telephone? Remember "Sorry about that,
Chief"?</TE>
<TE>   Biederman remains somewhat vague about how he obtained it, except
to say, "It wasn't for free."</TE>
<TE>   His collection, though extensive, is far from complete. The top
three items on his wish list are Derek Flint's gadget-laden lighter
and watch from "Our Man Flint," the Del Floria's "Tailor Shop" sign
and, of course, the Cone of Silence from "Get Smart."</TE>
<TE>   As he collected, Biederman also was raising a family after
marrying his wife, Bea, a dental hygienist. In keeping with his
passion, he even named his children after spy characters. Elder
daughter Illya, 15, is named after "U.N.C.L.E.'s" Kuryakin. Middle
child Moriah Flint is named for James Coburn's Derek Flint. And his
son, 9-year-old Bond, is named after Mr. Shaken, Not Stirred himself.</TE>
<TE>   With Biederman's collection came a reputation for being an expert
on the genre, which led to his consulting work (in one court case he
helped determine who owned the rights to the Bond character), which
led to his coming to the attention of the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   He recounted the oft-told story of coming home one evening and
punching the button of his answering machine. The messages included a
woman's voice instructing him to call the Central Intelligence
Agency. The tape did not self-destruct.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like, what did I do?" recalled Biederman. "What the heck
is this?" The voice at the other end of the phone turned out to be
Toni Hiley, curator of the CIA Museum, who had heard about Biederman
from the editor of the agency's internal newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "When I read that he had the shoe phone, I said this is too good
to pass up," said Hiley, who chuckled at the memory of the initial
call. "He wasn't sure if one of his friends was playing a joke on him
or whether it was really the CIA."</TE>
<TE>   Biederman next found himself picking up Carlos Davis, the chairman
of the CIA Fine Arts Commission (yes, there is one), and another
agent, who had flown to Los Angeles to see if the collection was
legitimate. In preparation, Biederman had assembled his entire
collection in the living room of his home. The CIA representatives
went through the items piece by piece.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a crime scene," said Biederman.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the CIA selected about 400 pieces, just one-tenth of the
collection, for display at CIA headquarters. Much of it was sent by
regular mail, but there were a few key pieces Biederman wanted to
bring with him personally when he flew to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   As they were going through airport security, Biederman was
suddenly struck by the fact that his carry-on bag contained items
that might look suspicious when they went though the X-ray scanner.
Sure enough, a security guard pulled him aside and asked him to open
his bag.</TE>
<TE>   "Sir, what is this?" she asked, unwrapping one of the items in his
bag.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shoe phone," he replied, deadpan.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, you can go," said the guard, without a trace of humor.</TE>
<TE>   According to Hiley, the show was a huge success among the real
spies. Biederman's memory is of being in a kind of twilight zone,
where the collector of spy memorabilia gets to meet the spies. At one
point, he was introduced to CIA Director George Tenet, whereupon
Biederman pulled out his "Man From U.N.C.L.E." radio pen and handed
it to him.</TE>
<TE>   "Open Channel D," said Tenet.</TE>

<HD>Under Their Wings</HD>
<DH>Defending America has taken on new meaning for the fighter
pilots who now patrol  the nation's skyways.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARIA ELENA FERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High above the clouds, the view is the only thing that remains the
same--Earth's curvature on the horizon, the beautiful orange sunsets
over the Pacific, the snow-capped Sierra.</LD>
<LD>   But in these days of heightened security and terrorist alerts, 100
fighter jets have joined the airliners that travel the nation's
skyways. For fighter pilots such as Maj. Rob Swertfager, that means
sitting in the snug cockpit of an F-16, four to six hours at a time,
several times a week, no distractions, no daydreaming, just hours of
unrelenting focus and tension. With his air-to-air missiles and
wing-mounted cannons at the ready, Swertfager's job is to intercept
and escort commercial planes and small craft when the federal
government requests it. In a worst-case scenario, his job is to shoot
them down.</LD>
<LD>   After three years of flying, Swertfager, who is stationed at the
144th Fighter Wing at Fresno Air Force Base, still gets goose bumps
at the view, but that's been his only constant since the world
changed on Sept. 11 and Operation Noble Eagle began.</LD>
<TE>   "Coming to work every day has a new meaning," said Swertfager, 35.
"When I kiss my kids goodbye in the morning, you realize that you're
going out to defend them. It sounds kind of corny but it's the
reality. We have all had to sit down and think about the
ramifications of shooting down a civilian plane. This is something we
are all trained to do, but it's not something we ever thought we
might do. Up there in that small cockpit, you have a lot of time to
think about the seriousness of homeland defense."</TE>
<TE>   Operation Noble Eagle--the surveillance of U.S. airspace underway
for the past five months--marks the first time combat air patrols, or
CAPs, have been used to fly over the nation since the Cuban missile
crisis in 1962. The patrols fly over 30 major U.S. cities, including
Los Angeles and San Francisco. Nearly 14,000 missions have been
completed.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the missions have cost $324 million and are straining the
resources of pilots, planes and crews around the nation, according to
the Air Force and Air National Guard, which have been lobbying to cut
the patrols over some cities even as President Bush hopes to increase
funding levels. The president's $2.1-trillion budget proposal for
fiscal 2003 includes an increase of $18.2 billion for homeland
defense. Of that, $1.3 billion has been earmarked for maintaining
combat air patrols.</TE>
<TE>   The 144th Fighter Wing in Fresno flew 1,105 hours of CAP missions
through December, according to Staff Sgt. Heather Pratt. Swertfager,
who flew his first such mission as the terror on the East Coast was
still unfolding, has completed about 60 hours on patrol.</TE>
<TE>   At 6:30 a.m. on Sept. 11, Swertfager was driving to work when he
turned on the radio. As he listened to news of jets smashing into New
York skyscrapers, he knew his job was about to change. "As soon as I
arrived, they were configuring a jet for an interception mission,"
Swertfager said. "Obviously there was a national emergency, and we
were scrambling. We didn't get to watch the whole thing on television
like everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   As the pilot sat in his cockpit waiting to taxi, people kept
running up to him with updates. The Pentagon has been hit! One of the
towers collapsed! Now the other one! Swertfager, followed by his
wingman, was ordered to intercept an overseas flight headed to San
Francisco.  His mission was to reach the aircraft as quickly as
possible, communicate with the pilot and assist in landing it.</TE>
<TE>   In the sky, at 1,500 mph, Swertfager kept thinking: What if the
pilot doesn't do what we tell him to do? What if he's not who he says
he is? What if this plane has been hijacked?</TE>
<TE>   "Our rules of engagement are not ambiguous," he said. "It's pretty
cut and  dried. We were absolutely terrified about what was happening
in our country. We were expecting attacks on the West Coast. I'm
focusing on the task at hand, but in the back of my mind the entire
time is: What if I have to shoot down a plane of civilians, the very
people I am sworn to protect?"</TE>
<TE>   Seventy minutes later, the airliner landed safely and Swertfager
was back in Fresno, exhausted. He had been in Saudi Arabia over the
summer, patrolling no-fly zones in southern Iraq, and was shot at so
many times he lost count. "I felt very confident in my ability to
attack the hostile fire.... That was mentally challenging and tense.
But that hour on Sept. 11 was the most emotionally, physically and
mentally draining day I've ever had."</TE>
<TE>   Swertfager, of course, wasn't the only one patrolling the skies
after the attacks. At midnight, Maj. Sean Navin, 35, went on his
first post-terrorism patrol, his F-16 the only jet in the vast, empty
California sky since the FAA shut down all airline travel.</TE>
<TE>   "On any given day, we vector in and around airliners and listen to
the traffic chatter on the radio," Navin said. "For us not to see or
hear anything was very eerie. The fear I felt was about the
uncertainty of what had just happened on the East Coast. Am I going
to be in the position of shooting down the people I'm sworn to
defend? The possibility of that exists now every time we are
airborne. If you had to do it, how would you ever recover emotionally
from something like that?"</TE>
<TE>   The pilots' commander, Col. Phil Skains, said he is confident
about the ability of his fliers to handle the toughest challenges in
the pursuit of homeland security. For 50 years, the 144th--the
longest-established air defense unit in the nation--has protected the
Southwest's airspace, often intercepting planes carrying drugs from
Mexico and Central America. By nightfall on Sept. 11, the 144th had
more airplanes and pilots ready for action than any other unit in the
country, Skains said. Eight of the unit's 15 fighter jets are now
assigned to Operation Noble Eagle, ready to be called to duty by
NORAD, the nation's air defense command center, at any time.</TE>
<TE>   From September through December, the combat air patrols responded
to Federal Aviation Administration and NORAD concerns 214 times, said
NORAD spokesman Maj. Mike Snyder. The typical CAP mission begins two
hours before flight time. Pilots arrive and check the weather,
receive their instructions from NORAD, calculate fuel, make sure the
jet is carrying the proper equipment, consult with intelligence
operatives and brief each other. They are not allowed to give details
about specific missions, but the 144th generally flies over
California.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots don their G-suits, which can weigh up to 48 pounds. The
suits are equipped with a bladder-type device that fills with air in
the helmet and chest to keep blood flowing in the upper part of the
body, to prevent blacking out under the intense pull of gravity
pilots experience.</TE>
<TE>   Following instructions, the fighter pilots fly to a certain area
where they may be called upon to escort airliners in which there have
been disturbances involving passengers, or simply to communicate with
the commercial pilots to make sure flights are running smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   Three miles into the air, the jets become invisible to those on
the ground. When they reach their assigned patrol space, they radio
air traffic controllers to find out which airliners are supposed to
be in the area. They make periodic checks with NORAD, and they wait.</TE>
<TE>   "You're really not doing anything," Swertfager said. "It's like
sitting in a chair for five straight hours without being able to go
to the bathroom or watch TV. But the challenge is that your mind
cannot drift. You have to constantly be on alert."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Navin said Mountain Dew and energy bars have become
his best friends. "We also do a lot of singing."</TE>
<TE>   Because fighter jets cannot hold enough fuel for the entire
mission, they must be refueled in midair. An F-16, for example, had
to refuel eight times to cross the ocean during Operation Desert
Storm. Before Sept. 11, the 163rd Air Refueling Wing in Riverside was
already the busiest such unit in the United States, said Col. Albert
Aimar, the commander. "Now we're even busier."</TE>
<TE>   The 163rd's 10 KC-135 Stratotankers refuel long-range bombers,
F-15s and F-16s, which are performing training missions or CAPs all
over the country. Pilots fly tankers to target areas and wait for
fighters in the zone to arrive and line up for fuel, both planes
traveling at about 475 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "Without the tankers the fighters couldn't do any work," said
Master Sgt. John Haus on the tanker Grizzly II. Haus and Staff Sgt.
Allen Gittins operate the "boom," which acts like the fuel pump.
"They cannot exceed a certain weight for takeoff, and carrying the
weapons adds a lot of weight," said Haus, who has been refueling jets
for six years. "So they go up in the air and burn down about 70% and
come back to refuel. Once they have airspeed, they can fill up."</TE>
<TE>   Inside the tanker as it soars above Utah, doing figure-eights in a
45-mile orbit, Gittins sits in the cockpit calculating fuel
measurements. Since the refueling pod is at the bottom and back of
the tanker, fighter jets line up 40 to 50 feet beneath the tanker and
wait for Gittins to "lower the boom" and begin the refueling.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting for the fighter jets to arrive, Haus relaxes in the pod,
admiring the reflection of the heavy snow on the ground in Utah
against the crisp blue of the sky. "This is the best view in the
house," Haus said. "The pilots see where they are going, but we get
to see where we've been."</TE>
<TE>   Swertfager would argue that his vantage point is the best. On
active duty for seven years, he was inspired to become a pilot after
a conversation with a former Vietnam War pilot. Married for eight
years and the father of three little girls, Swertfager says that
flying, even in these tense times, fills him up like nothing else
can.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the enjoyment of flying fighters was stolen from us on
Sept. 11," he said. "Everything is really serious now and, at times,
scary. But when you're flying an F-16, since the cockpit is all
glass, you get the sensation that you're sitting on top of it. That
view of the world, there's nothing like it."</TE>

17 issue of Southern California Living incorrectly implied that the

<LD>It is the latest in an endless ser- ies of skirmishes that seem to
mark our Sunday nights at home.</LD>
<LD>   My fifth-grader is rummaging through her backpack, looking for a
missing assignment ... the homework I've been asking about all
weekend, the homework she insisted she didn't have. It is already 9
p.m. "How does this happen?" I ask, irritated. "You're old enough to
keep up with your work."</LD>
<LD>   She slams her notebook on the table and glares back. "Stop
bothering me about it," she says, her voice defensive and sharp, as
if I am somehow to blame. "I just forgot, OK? Don't make such a big
deal of it, OK?"</LD>
<TE>   I glance around the kitchen at dirty dinner dishes, unread
newspapers, two hungry dogs waiting to be fed. Upstairs, her sisters
are fighting over the shower, complaining that there's only one clean
towel left.</TE>
<TE>   "No," I yell, in a voice loud enough for all three to hear. "It is
not OK! None of this is OK!" And I launch into a tirade about undone
homework and unfolded laundry and an inconsiderate trio of daughters
who know nothing about responsibility. I stomp off and up the stairs
and hear their muffled complaints through my bedroom door. "So mean
... always grouchy ... why did she even have kids?"</TE>
<TE>   Why indeed, I wonder. I lie in bed and flip through a magazine,
nursing feelings of anger, failure and betrayal. I push, I prod, I
set examples, I lecture them about responsibility. If they're not
learning it, am I not teaching? I feel disappointed in them, and in
me.</TE>
<TE>   Later that night she slinks into my bedroom to kiss me and to say
good night. "Did you find your homework?" I ask her. She shakes her
head, and I see tear stains on her face. "Well, it's time for bed.
You'll just have to live with the consequences. Maybe a few zeros
will teach you about responsibility." I wave her off and turn away.</TE>
<TE>   But I can't sleep, and hours later I slip downstairs and leaf
through her notebook, searching for the assignment she needs. I'm
weary of the effort of training children, tired of trying to
calculate the long-term costs of every gesture. I simply want to
rescue my child; that feels like my motherly duty too.</TE>
<TE>   I fail to find the missing homework, but deep inside my daughter's
English folder I come across an assignment I am drawn to read:
"Things My Parents Taught Me," it is titled. Below, in her unsteady
cursive, are a list of lessons I never even tried to teach:</TE>
<TE>   How to share</TE>
<TE>   That I can't have everything I want</TE>
<TE>   To have manners and to use them</TE>
<TE>   To forgive people</TE>
<TE>   To try my hardest</TE>
<TE>   To be strong</TE>
<TE>   That not all people are nice</TE>
<TE>   To respect your elders</TE>
<TE>   To be loving</TE>
<TE>   To love and respect God</TE>
<TE>   There are certain times when I can't talk</TE>
<TE>   To pray every night before I go to bed.</TE>
<TE>   Almost every successful man or woman seems to have some story to
tell about the lessons Mom or Dad conveyed, and how those messages
helped shape their lives. I imagined I'd guide my daughters, as well,
through earnest talks and morality tales reflecting the values I
held. But it turns out that the most important lessons I've taught
them may not have come in lectures or "When I was your age ...''
bromides.</TE>
<TE>   I think of that later, when my best friend calls from Atlanta,
disconsolate and blubbering. Her son has decided to drop out of
college. It's his junior year, his grades have fallen, he's been
reassigned to second-string on the football team. And he's just
realized that the average salary in his chosen field--journalism--is
about $30,000 a year. So he's quitting school to become a rap star.
He's already recorded his first CD; before long, he says, he'll be
touring the country.</TE>
<TE>   "He won't listen to reason," she says through tears. "All I've
taught him doesn't seem to matter."</TE>
<TE>   I know the struggles she has faced. A single mother raising two
sons, she's moved back and forth across the country, pursuing better
jobs and more opportunity. She earned her college degree at 40,
juggling work and classes, PTA meetings and football practice. At 45,
with both sons in college, she launched her own computer training
business.</TE>
<TE>   Now she's crying because "I spent all their lives talking to my
boys about perseverance and discipline, so they'd be prepared, so
they wouldn't have to struggle like me."</TE>
<TE>   That may be what her sons heard, but what, I wonder, did they see?
Perhaps a fearless woman unbowed by defeat, always willing to take a
risk, unable to resist following her dreams. Sometimes what we live
is what we teach.</TE>
<TE>   And I pull out my daughter's list and read it again, understanding
now that what she says she's learned is what raising children has
taught me:</TE>
<TE>   To forgive people. That I can't have everything I want. To be
strong. There are certain times when I can't talk. And to pray every
night before I go to bed.</TE>

<LD>Mark and his dad shot hoops. They played shark chase. Then they built
a house from blocks of wood. "This is the house I want to build for
you when I grow up!" said Mark proudly.</LD>
<LD>   Mark's dad thought they should nail it together. But he hammered
his finger by mistake, and it really hurt. They laughed because it
was so funny!</LD>
<LD>   "Tomorrow, I have to go away for two weeks, son."</LD>
<TE>   "What's two weeks?" Mark asked.</TE>
<TE>   So Mark's father lifted him up with only one arm and counted to
14. "Each number is a day," Dad explained.</TE>
<TE>   "Hmmmm," Mark said. "That didn't take long."</TE>
<TE>   Dad frowned. He counted out seven blocks of wood. "Let's pretend
each block is one day. Then multiply by two. That's how many days
I'll be gone."</TE>
<TE>   Now Mark was frowning.</TE>
<TE>   "Each block is like a piece of the year. The year has 12 months,
and there are usually four weeks in a month."</TE>
<TE>   "I know that there are 24 hours in a day, and sometimes I try to
count the hours, but then I lose track. Dad, when will I see you
again?"</TE>
<TE>   Dad thought hard. "OK. Let's say you hear one story every night
before going to bed."</TE>
<TE>   "But sometimes I hear two or three stories before I fall asleep!"
Mark said.</TE>
<TE>   Dad thought hard again. "All right. What if you count how many
sleeps until I get back?"</TE>
<TE>   "Did you say sheeps or sleeps?" Mark asked. "Mom always tells me
to count sheep when I can't fall asleep."</TE>
<TE>   "Sleeps."</TE>
<TE>   "So if I count 14 sleeps, that means it will be time for you to
come home?"</TE>
<TE>   "That's right!" Dad said.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow! I can't wait until it's just one more sheep--I mean sleep!
Now can we play bucking bronco?"</TE>

<HD>Greuel for City Council</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After 30 years of Joel Wachs, voters in Los Angeles' 2nd City Council
District will elect a new council member March 5 and a City Council
already roiled by term limits will gain yet another fresh player. The
best choice for both the east San Fernando Valley district and the
city overall is Wendy Greuel.</LD>
<LD>   Greuel spent 10 years as an aide to the late Mayor Tom Bradley,
helping to shape the after-school program LA's BEST. Her Valley
credentials include a four-year stint with the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, where she was the point person for $1
billion in federal disaster assistance after the 1994 Northridge
earthquake. Since 1997 she has worked for DreamWorks SKG as liaison
to community-based organizations and charities.</LD>
<LD>   None of three candidates in the 2nd District's December special
election won more than 50% of the vote, leaving Greuel and state
Assemblyman Tony Cardenas, the top vote-getters, to continue
canvassing. Cardenas represents the district's northeast section in
the state Legislature but is up against term limits and looking for
another public office. He too has some impressive accomplishments,
but also some negatively impressive baggage.</LD>
<TE>   A report released earlier this month by the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office found some evidence that Cardenas, who has
been a major recipient of Indian gaming contributions, encouraged
three tribes to pay for controversial mailers attacking former
Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa in last year's mayoral
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas, who supported then-City Atty., now-Mayor James K. Hahn,
says he is "vindicated" by the report because it does not provide
evidence that he was acting on the Hahn campaign's behalf, which
would have violated campaign finance laws. But the report does link
Cardenas to some of the nastiest and most divisive advertising in
that campaign. That's the kind of politics Los Angeles needs to
eliminate, not encourage.</TE>

<HD>Easing the Term Limits Box</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There's one place in California where recycling is total: the
Capitol. That's where legislators regularly repackage themselves and
seek new life in another elective office because term limits force
out both the effective and the ineffective at a fixed time.
California's term limits law is among the most restrictive in the
nation, holding Assembly members to six years and state senators to
eight years. It's an automatic-pilot system of governance that
doesn't distinguish between political deadbeats and the best and
brightest public servants.</LD>
<LD>   State voters will face a measure on the March 5 primary ballot
that would help provide a way out of the term limits box. Proposition
45 would allow legislators on the verge of being forced out to win a
chance at an extension by collecting signatures of voters within
their district.</LD>
<LD>   The signature threshold is 20% of the total of votes in the most
recent election for that office, the same amount it takes to force a
recall election. Legislators gaining the required signatures still
would have to stand for election in the traditional way.</LD>
<TE>   This certainly is not the perfect way to deal with California's
term limits problems. It would be better to rid the state of term
limits. But legislative leaders believe that voters would reject such
a plan. They probably are correct. And any change in term limits
requires a majority vote of the people because the limits are written
into the state Constitution by voter approval. With no other
realistic alternative available, we urge state voters to approve
Proposition 45.</TE>
<TE>   A major problem with term limits is that as soon as a member
develops some experience in legislating and a solid background in an
issue--the point at which their service becomes really valuable--they
are bumped from office. This has upset the balance of power in
Sacramento. And the office of governor, already one of the most
powerful in the nation, has assumed even more clout over legislators.</TE>
<TE>   With the end of their service bluntly visible, lawmakers look for
quick victories. There's little to gain politically by attempting to
fix entrenched, complicated problems, such as the deplorable state of
California's infrastructure or the quagmire of the state-local
finance system.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 45 was put on the March 5 ballot by initiative
petition, an effort led by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton
(D-San Francisco) and supported by a variety of interest groups
including big business and organized labor. The state Democratic
Party has contributed $3 million to the campaign to pass 45. But the
measure also has the backing of the League of Women Voters and the
Sierra Club.</TE>
<TE>   It's assumed that the same interests that help get the lawmakers
elected would also put up the money to help incumbents stay another
term. That's the system we have. But if Proposition 45 wins voter
approval, the Legislature should pass a law making it absolutely
clear that state contribution limits apply to the petition campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Term limits have done some good in California. There are more
women and minorities in Sacramento now. A few incompetents were
forced from office. Those benefits are far outweighed by the negative
impact of the revolving door. Californians can keep term limits and
make them more realistic by voting yes on Proposition 45.</TE>

<LD>Re "New Version Will Replace Pulled Koran," Feb. 12: I am one of
those "some" offended Jews who are heartened to see that the 1934
book "The Meaning of the Holy Quran" has been withdrawn from LAUSD
libraries. However, I disagree with Michael Hirschfeld, executive
director of the Jewish Community Relations Committee of the Los
Angeles Jewish Federation, who praises the settlement and states that
head of the Omar Ibn Khattab Foundation Dafer Dakhil's apology was
sincere and that Dakhil said it was "a mistake . . . and [that he]
was interested in doing whatever possible to bridge differences."</LD>
<LD>   It is clear that the only "mistake" made was that an astute
teacher in our school system uncovered in this Koran the diatribes
against the Jews and their religion. However, the fact remains that
this anti-Semitic version of the Koran is a Muslim national
bestseller and therefore influences all those who read it as a
fundamental view of Judaism.</LD>
<LD>   Only when the Muslim community removes this vile text from its own
shelves will this Jew praise the settlement.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Schools Remove Donated Books" (Feb. 7) discusses the removal of
Korans from L.A. schools because of commentary that was deemed
"derogatory toward Jews." The footnote quoted in the article, "The
Jews in their arrogance claimed that all wisdom and all knowledge of
Allah was enclosed in their hearts. But there were more things in
heaven and earth than were dreamt of in their philosophy. Their claim
was not only arrogance but blasphemy," is not anti-Semitic. It does
not claim that Jews are inferior or must be defeated by the Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, it explains that the Jews at the time of the prophet were
not willing to accept the message of Islam because they believed they
already possessed the knowledge of God.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, the Bible and Torah have equally, if not more,
repulsive language dealing with Gentiles, women and slaves. If these
books are allowed to remain in school libraries, the Koran must be
allowed to as well.</TE>

<TE>   Regarding the new version of the Koran that L.A. schools received:
I understand that Jews might object to the footnote that suggests
they are "arrogant" in claiming that "all wisdom and all knowledge of
Allah was enclosed in their hearts."</TE>
<TE>   However, I also object to the rest of that footnote: "There were
more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in their
philosophy."</TE>
<TE>   It is Hamlet's remark to his friend Horatio and should be
attributed to William Shakespeare if it is going to appear in any new
text of the Koran adopted by the LAUSD. We have enough trouble with
students plagiarizing without having it modeled in one of our
allegedly holy books!</TE>

<HD>Former Compton Mayor Returned to Office</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On Feb. 8 Superior Court Judge Judith C. Chirlin put Omar Bradley
back in the Compton mayor's office based on a theory of primacy (Feb.
9). She admitted that Eric Perrodin did nothing illegal; however, she
still ousted a man who had been doing a terrific job as mayor for all
the citizens of Compton.</LD>
<LD>   In my opinion the judge's decision shows a poor sense of judgment.
Removing an elected official from office because his name was first
on the ballot has basically stripped Compton citizens of their voting
rights.</LD>
<LD>   Chirlin doesn't have any ties to the city of Compton; therefore
she didn't have any clue how the citizens of Compton were treated
under Bradley's governance. He had no sense of democracy as he
conducted City Council meetings and ran the city like a dictatorship.
Without this knowledge the judge's decision leaves the people of
Compton in a state of dictatorial rule.</LD>

<HD>Parks Support Backs Blacks Into a Corner</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ED BOYER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the cold slap of reality still stinging, black elected officials
and some community leaders remain in an uproar over Mayor James K.
Hahn's announcement that he will not support a second term for Police
Chief Bernard C. Parks. These are the same leaders who have been in
the forefront of the battle for police reform, but they have rallied
behind a chief who has resisted reform at every turn. These are the
same leaders who have demanded more effective community control of
the LAPD, but they are unwavering in their support of a chief who
felt the department could best police itself.</LD>
<LD>   As the issue of racial profiling made its way to the national
agenda, Parks steadfastly maintained that his officers did not engage
in that practice. But he once gave an interviewer what amounted to a
textbook definition of racial profiling.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not the fault of the police when they stop minority males or
put them in jail," he said. "It's the fault of the minority males for
committing the crime. In my mind, it is not a great revelation that,
if officers are looking for criminal activity, they're going to look
at the kind of people who are listed on crime reports."</LD>
<TE>   Imagine, for a moment, what the reaction would have been had
former Chief Daryl F. Gates said that. But hardly a peep was heard
from the same community leaders who now feel that Hahn betrayed them.</TE>
<TE>   Some black leaders have been and remain willing to give Parks a
pass. He is their neighbor. They have his ear. And these are
important factors, given the black community's long, unhappy history
with the LAPD. But having Parks' ear apparently did not help at all
in getting the chief to accept civilian control. Nor did it
apparently persuade the chief to at least look seriously at racial
profiling. Parks only joined the ranks of reformers after a federal
consent decree--an order he fought tooth and nail--mandated reform.</TE>
<TE>   His outraged supporters backed the person, not necessarily his
policies; the individual, rather than the institution.</TE>
<TE>   That contradiction was evident at First AME Church about a year
ago. The issue was racial profiling--DWB, or Driving While Black or
Brown--and the restive crowd was eager to tell the assembled
law-enforcement representatives and elected officials about how
police had stopped them for what appeared to have been no reason
other than their color.</TE>
<TE>   Speaker after outraged speaker, nearly all African American and
Latino, offered a litany of indignities suffered during these stops
as Parks and other officials listened stoically. The American Civil
Liberties Union of Southern California had organized a town hall
meeting to build support for a racial-profiling bill that would have
required police agencies to note, among other things, the race of
every motorist they stopped--a bill Parks adamantly opposed. During
the meeting, the ACLU collected signatures on a letter to California
Gov. Gray Davis, urging him to sign the bill rather than veto it as
he had an identical piece of legislation the year before.</TE>
<TE>   After the last speaker had vented his anger, Councilman Nate
Holden moved to a microphone and began offering a defense of Parks.
Before Holden could complete a sentence, the crowd took up a chant:
"Sign the letter, Nate! Sign the letter, Nate!" Holden tried again,
but the chant only grew louder. After what appeared to be a very long
minute or two, Holden returned to his seat.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't have the finesse that evening to first acknowledge that
the crowd's complaints were serious concerns before launching his
defense of the chief. The other two City Council members present,
Mark Ridley-Thomas and Rita Walters, did not speak. Ridley-Thomas and
Holden are speaking now. So is Najee Ali--executive director of
Project Islamic HOPE--one of those who shouted Holden down. He has
gone so far as to call for what would doubtless be an unsuccessful
effort to recall Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone in that room knew Parks had steadfastly maintained that
the LAPD simply did not engage in racial profiling. And probably each
person in that room could have described an incident from personal
experience that looked for all the world like racial profiling.</TE>
<TE>   When the bill made its way to the governor's desk, Davis worked
out a compromise that effectively gutted the legislation. It would
not require data collection--something the bill's backers had
insisted was crucial. Davis did order the California Highway Patrol
to collect such data, and several law-enforcement agencies around the
state decided to do so voluntarily. Of the state's largest police
departments, only the LAPD, under Parks' leadership, refused. In the
cold calculus of politics, Davis looked at the bill's supporters, on
one side, and its opponents, chiefly the law-enforcement lobby, on
the other. And the governor wasn't about to take on that lobby.</TE>
<TE>   In the L.A. mayoral race last year, Hahn was faced with a similar
choice, but he managed to have his cake and eat it, too. The Police
Protective League, the union representing L.A. officers, extracted a
signed pledge from Hahn that he would restore their compressed work
schedules. Black-community leaders "assumed" that Hahn would support
a second term for Parks. The league had its promise in writing. Black
leaders based theirs on trust. Rather than demand a guarantee, they
looked at Hahn's pedigree--the legacy of his father, the late county
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn. Those leaders then found themselves in bed
with the Protective League and West San Fernando Valley
conservatives, backing the same candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an unusual coalition, to say the least," Ridley-Thomas, who
backed Hahn's opponent, Antonio Villaraigosa, said after the
election. "How you govern with that level of polarity has to be
figured out."</TE>
<TE>   He could not have had any idea of how Hahn would figure it out.</TE>
<TE>   Bad blood between the league, long suspect in the black community,
and Parks has been festering for some time. Hahn, though, had his own
frustrations with the chief's rigidity. Did Hahn borrow a page from
Davis' political playbook? Did he put the league's endorsement and
the backing of black community leaders on a scale and decide he
couldn't fight that lobby?</TE>
<TE>   It looks that way to some black political activists, who insist
that Hahn will be a one-term mayor. That may be true if the mayor
finds himself in a race as close as the last one. The black vote will
be as critical in such a race as it was in Hahn's election. But it
may not be. What began as rumor in the black community--that Hahn's
new police chief will be Latino--is now almost accepted as fact. Such
a move would shore up Hahn's support among increasingly important
Latino voters and isolate even more the black leaders who are so
loudly crying foul.</TE>
<TE>   Latino gains do not necessarily mean black losses. Nor is the
reverse true. Several prominent Latino politicians learned their
earliest political lessons working for or with former Assembly
Speaker Willie Brown. The Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund can trace its roots to the NAACP Legal Defense and
Education Fund, and some of the most important local Latino leaders
come out of the Tom Bradley coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Blacks have not been a majority in Los Angeles since 1781, when
they made up the majority of pobladores who founded El Pueblo de
Nuestra Senora La Reina de Los Angeles de Porciuncula. As the size of
the black vote in L.A. continues to shrink, black politicians and
community leaders will have to look to new coalitions. And they would
do well to look to the growing number of Latino voters. As the
racial-profiling issue demonstrated, younger blacks and browns can
come together in an effort to bring about change even though their
leadership remained largely on the sidelines. The issues confronting
those two communities are often identical, but it remains to be seen
whether they can make common cause.</TE>
<TE>   If black and brown leaders focus on policies rather than
personalities and ethnicity, they will inevitably find themselves
working together. But if black community leaders insist on backing
the person, as they did with Parks--even when he opposed critical
changes in policy--the Los Angeles electorate can look forward to
many more years of Balkanization, with the black share of that
divided turf being reduced to an ever-more isolated enclave.</TE>

<HD>Tech Bubble Redux</HD>
<DH>Broadband isn't the next new-economy miracle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even as the Enron and Global Crossing bankruptcies further expose the
spectacular waste fostered by the 1990s' Information Age bubble, an
army of lobbyists in Washington is fighting to secure government
support for broadband communications, the "next wave" of the "new
economy." Subsidizing an ultra-fast Internet, it's said, will
energize everything, from the stock market to our democracy itself.
But if the unbalanced, profligate economy of the '90s has taught us
anything, it should be the danger of granting any one sector, no
matter how appealing, special political favor.</LD>
<LD>   To a remarkable extent, broadband boosters are recycling promises
unfulfilled in the 1990s. Then, as now, they assert that super-fast
digital communications will spur new entertainment programming and
make possible such life-saving devices as toilets that monitor waste
to detect health problems. Computer gadgetry and improved online
commerce will rise to new levels of sophistication. And by ensuring
greater access to information, our political institutions will be
enriched.</LD>
<LD>   Given such wondrous benefits, everyone should be champing at the
broadband bit. Yet, there's a problem. More than enough cable
capacity crisscrosses the United States to transmit bulk broadband
signals. But not many are paying to hook up the "last mile" of this
network to their homes and businesses.</LD>
<TE>   That's where broadband advocates say government support--targeted
tax incentives, state and federal grants, regulatory reform and
mandatory connectivity requirements--is required.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast with the late 1990s, the new-economy lobby is having a
tougher time selling its technology miracle. President Bush ignored
industry pressure to allude to broadband in his State of the Union
address. Subsidy skeptics have been quick to point out that since
cable television already has excess broadcast capacity, there's no
reason to think new broadband channels will stimulate novel
programming or entertainment options. The collapse of broadband
providers that hooked up consumers, like Excite@Home, also suggests
caution.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the most important reason to resist elevating broadband above
other sectors of the economy is that such favoritism contributed to
the worst excesses of the 1990s' bubble economy. Like all human
endeavors, business and politics are influenced by fashion and hype.
When public attention is obsessed with a small segment of the
economy, as in the latter '90s, misguided investment and policy
decisions almost inevitably follow.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the "business to business" Internet mania, the attempt to
automate inter-corporate sales. Fed by countless media, Wall Street
and public pronouncements, B2B, as the mania was known, was touted as
an absolutely "can't miss" phase of the new economy. Even normally
sensible industrialists like former General Electric chairman Jack
Welch giddily declared it "the elixir that big companies need" to
become more nimble and competitive. Hundreds of billions of dollars
were earmarked to "modernize" business Internet linkages.</TE>
<TE>   B2B service providers sprouted everywhere. Some, like Ariba Inc.,
a Northern California e-commerce software firm, didn't even have a
product to sell, yet attracted nearly $6 billion when it went public
in mid-1999. A few months later, Ariba's stock had risen by nearly
800%, and the company's market value was higher than that of Boeing,
General Motors or Ford. But Ariba, like other once-flourishing B2B
companies like Chemdex Corp. or VerticalNet Inc., never turned a
profit. Something new and incredible was apparently generating
unbelievable wealth in hitherto unknown ways.</TE>
<TE>   Except it wasn't. When tested in the real world, most B2B business
plans were exposed as either incomplete or poorly conceived. Promised
inter-corporate efficiencies never came close to justifying the
expense.</TE>
<TE>   Firms like Ariba and VerticalNet promptly shed nearly 98% of their
peak market value. Others, like Chemdex, went out of business.
Silicon Valley alone consumed an unheard-of $21 billion of venture
capital in 2000, many times the previous year's record, only to earn
the most negative returns in U.S. investment history. All told, $3
trillion to $4 trillion--the equivalent of hundreds of Enrons or
Global Crossings--was stripped from the value of U.S. stocks and
America's retirement nest eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Worse still, public policies that favored white-collar Information
Age jobs over working- and middle-class employment harmfully skewed
U.S. economic development. Mistaken perceptions about the
sustainability of new-economy growth, fed in part by the political
influence reaped from windfall corporate and personal-income growth,
transformed land-use and development policies. The ill-informed
spending decisions that politicians made then have now produced
unanticipated budgetary shortfalls in state after state.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most unsettling legacies of the last decade's boom is
how rapidly a new class of super-rich political entrepreneurs was
able to capture, if not monopolize, our country's political life,
despite a lack of true economic capability. According to the San Jose
Mercury News, for example, Ariba's top nine executives cashed out
more than $1 billion worth of stock options just before their
company's value collapsed. Similarly, Global Crossing's chairman,
Gary Winnick, is reported to have exercised nearly $735 million worth
of options before his company became insolvent. This pattern of
instant yet ultimately undeserved enrichment characterized the latter
stages of the 1990s boom.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting cadre of articulate, well-educated, cash-flush
advocates courted state, local and federal politicians, filling their
coffers with campaign contributions. In return, Information-Age
business was showered with tax breaks and preferential permit
processing, and was assured a seat at the table when matters of
significant fiscal or social policy were decided.</TE>
<TE>   One result was that in countless communities, it became virtually
impossible to secure permits in a timely manner and open an "old
economy" pursuit, like a factory or a shipping company. Moratoria
against such development, even in industrial districts or near
airports, were commonplace. All things virtual, however, were avidly
courted and afforded the most expedited public review.</TE>
<TE>   In California, where Bay Area Information Age businesses parlayed
their media and financial power into unprecedented political
influence, entire sectors of the economy stopped expanding. During
1995 to 1998, as the state roared out of recession, nearly 20% of
California's 1 million new jobs were in manufacturing and wholesale
trade, essential sectors for middle-and working- class social
advancement. As public enchantment with the new economy devalued such
activities, however, the state's manufacturing and wholesale-trade
employment growth went negative between 1998-2001, despite a still
robust economy.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, California's spending priorities were distorted
by the false promise of Internet wealth. As in most states, the
over-concentration of stock-market investment in a handful of
unproven companies fostered dramatic tax-revenue increases when their
executives exercised their stock options. Despite many warnings to
the contrary, California's political leadership acted as if such
trends would continue forever. The state went on an unprecedented
hiring binge. Nearly 210,000 new employees were added to state and
local government bureaucracies since 1998, an astounding 10% growth
in total public-sector employment in just three years.</TE>
<TE>   When the bubble burst, of course, tax revenues plummeted, but the
state's new payroll obligation of more than $10 billion remained.
Ironically, that's almost the amount of California's projected
$14-billion deficit that threatens to cripple state public finance.</TE>
<TE>   Broadband communications may one day live up to its boosters'
claims and earn a niche, perhaps even an important one, in the U.S.
economy. If the last decade is any guide, however, we can ill-afford
the inevitable long-term costs of such policies at a time when
bread-and-butter concerns like defense and energy demand far more
serious attention.</TE>

<HD>Why Reward Iran's Zealots?</HD>
<DH>Reformers have no choice but to join in the anti-American
chorus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NIKKI R. KEDDIE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush's inclusion of Iran in an "axis of evil" is a bizarre
and seemingly inexplicable expansion of his war on terrorism. It
involves a disturbing--and major--policy shift: Iran is now a
potential military target primarily because U.S. officials say it is
developing weapons of mass destruction. Bush's hostile rhetoric,
furthermore, has strengthened the hands of Iran's religious
hard-liners at the expense of its reformers, who now have no
alternative but to unite behind the conservative clerics' virulent
anti-Americanism. Recent administration statements explaining its
position on Iran do not undo the effects of its threats. It is hard
to imagine a more counterproductive policy.</LD>
<LD>   The charges undergirding the policy shift are based on an
exaggeratedly negative view of Iran, an unwarranted dismissal of the
role reformists play and a misplaced belief that we can control
change in Iran. For example, many states are working on processes and
collecting materials that could lead to the production of nuclear
weapons, but the U.S. does not threaten most of them militarily and,
indeed, has good relations with two states that recently tested
nuclear devices. We have been unable to stop any state from
developing nuclear weapons, whatever we say or do.</LD>
<TE>   Then there is the Karine-A incident, the ship loaded with
Iranian-supplied armaments that was intercepted by Israelis before it
reached the Palestinian Authority last month. Numerous articles in
the European press and in the Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz have
cast grave doubts on the Israeli government's official story. Some
suggest that a militant Palestinian faction opposed to Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat arranged the shipment to embarrass Arafat and
scuttle any hopes of peace. Others have raised the possibility that
all or part of the smuggling operation was stage-managed by some
Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Iran, to be sure, opposes Israeli policies toward the
Palestinians, an opposition widely shared outside of the U.S. But
Iran's support for Arafat and his Palestinian Authority is
overwhelmingly rhetorical. The only thing likely to change Iran's
attitude toward Israel is a settlement of the Israel-Palestine
conflict that ends Israeli occupation and creates a Palestinian
state.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. charges that Tehran has facilitated the escape of some
members of Al Qaeda--its long-standing enemy--to Iran and is
undermining the new Afghan government in Kabul by meddling in western
Afghanistan politics are especially weak. For years, Iran has tried
to seal its long border with Afghanistan, which is the source of
unwanted drugs and millions of refugees, but cracks remain. And it
seems strange to expect Iran not to have an interest in events in
Afghan territory near its borders, given the anarchy and warlordism
that continue there.</TE>
<TE>   But even if one accepted the Bush administration's charges against
Iran, none would pose a threat to the U.S. to justify a move away
from negotiations toward ultimatums. Besides its stated reasons, the
administration appears to accept Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon's view that Iraq and Iran must be threatened simultaneously.
Most U.S. government officials want to bring down Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein but that might weaken Iraq and strengthen Iran. A
stronger Iran worries some in the administration, a danger they
believe is best obviated by threatening military action against it.
These officials also apparently think that reformers in Iran will
back this policy. But a recent independent Iranian public opinion
poll and last week's huge anti-American demonstrations show that most
Iranians oppose it.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to the alarmist and negative views held by Israel and by
many in the Bush administration, Iran has undergone major changes in
recent years. While further progress in politics may be blocked for
now because conservative clerics control the main instruments of
government, continuing changes in Iranian society are causes for
hope.</TE>
<TE>   In international relations, Iran's government has encouraged the
creation of numerous economic and political ties with Western Europe
and Japan. Many officials, including Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami and Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, have taken steps to
improve relations with the U.S. Several international conferences
have been held in Iran, with the U.S. invited to participate. One
recent project, sponsored by the Iranian Institute of Imam Khomeini
and Islamic Revolution, involved the publication of the views, some
of them controversial by Iran's standards, of prominent U.S.-based
Iran scholars. Regrettably, these trends toward better relations with
the West, doggedly contested by conservatives, have been further
undermined by Bush's "axis of evil" rhetoric. Already, there have
been consequences. Khatami and other reformers called for
anti-American protests Feb. 11, and millions responded.</TE>
<TE>   Hopeful long-term developments within Iran include the expansion
of civil society, education, health and women's roles. In four
national elections since 1997, reformist candidates received a huge
majority of votes, and the great majority of them took their seats.
Despite crackdowns on the reformist press, book publishing remains
remarkably open, including translations of controversial works about
Iran. Education has expanded to include most boys and girls, and the
curriculum is overwhelmingly modern. Women now constitute a slight
majority of the students at Tehran University.</TE>
<TE>   Women's and reformists' struggles have succeeded in restoring a
number of legal rights for women nullified by Iran's former supreme
leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, though much more remains to be
done. Women are prominent in nearly all professions. Proportionally,
there are probably more women film directors in Iran than anywhere
else, and Iranian films highlight social problems in ways impossible
in more dictatorial countries. Conservative curbs on dress and
behavior are increasingly flaunted with impunity. The government has
also pursued one of the world's most effective voluntary
birth-control programs.</TE>
<TE>   Newly educated and largely reformist Iranians dislike Iran's
clerical regime, are discouraged by the country's bad economic
situation and resist limits on their freedom, but they also reject
U.S. threats against their country. Reformers in Iran differ about
what to do to end conservative clerical control, but they
overwhelmingly agree that U.S. threats to strike militarily at
suspected nuclear-weapons factories can only reduce the possibilities
for more open domestic and foreign policies.</TE>
<TE>   Before greater harm is inflicted upon U.S.-Iran relations, the
Bush administration should back off its counterproductive rhetoric
and instead build on Iran's underlying trend toward change and
numerous recent helpful acts in the war on terrorism, such as
allowing U.S. food relief to be unloaded at a gulf port. Continuing
current U.S. policy can only give further aid and comfort to Iran's
hard-line clerics.</TE>

<HD>The Latest Assault on Teens: It's Their Brains</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE MALES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SANTA CRUZ</DL>
<LD>Neurobiologist Richard Restak's new book, "The Secret Life of the
Brain," now serialized by PBS, is one of many recent works crediting
neuroscience with confirming popular stereotypes of teenagers as rash
and unthinking. PBS' promo for "The Teenage Brain" segment stated:
"As the brain begins teeming with hormones, the prefrontal cortex,
the center of reasoning and impulse control, is still a work in
progress. For the first time, scientists can offer an explanation for
what parents already know--adolescence is a time of roiling emotions,
and poor judgment."</LD>
<LD>   Restak invites readers to choose their own adjectives--all
negative--to describe adolescents: "difficult," "unpredictable,"
"moody." Only when they reach adulthood, "the culmination of human
brain development," do young people become "mature," "likable" and
"courteous," he adds. Other experts say teens suffer "biological
tumult," "impulsiveness" and "disregard for consequences."</LD>
<LD>   Such claims should be greeted with caution. Theories founded in
"biological determinism"--that the behaviors of certain human
populations result from innate limitations in their intelligence and
reasoning capacities--inevitably win initial praise. Then research
dismantles the theories, often after they have inspired harmful
policies.</LD>
<TE>   Today's authoritative-sounding statements about adolescents are
similar to those eminent scientists once confidently issued regarding
the supposedly flawed cerebrums of women and "inferior races," as
Harvard University scientist Stephen Jay Gould writes in "The
Mismeasure of Man." Researchers a century ago asserted that African
Americans' "less developed posterior lobe" explained their supposed
impulsivity, irrationality and violent behavior. Women's
underdeveloped brains, wrote psychologist and sociologist Gustav Le
Bon, produced "fickleness, inconstancy, absence of thought and logic,
and incapacity to reason." America's preeminent early-1900s
psychologist, G. Stanley Hall, argued that "savage" races,
biologically, are "adolescents." Today's scientists reverse the
sentence: Adolescents, biologically, are savages.</TE>
<TE>   Modern science is more sophisticated, but skepticism of its misuse
to uphold popular stereotypes and official needs remains. Youth have
been a favorite target. A 1987 University of Wisconsin analysis of
scientific theories on teen behavior published in decades of journal
articles found strong evidence of "ideological purpose." When
politicians and business interests need more youths for wars and
employment booms, scientists pronounce adolescents "capable and
adult-like"; during peacetime and economic downturns, adolescents are
"psychologically incapacitated ... immature and slow to develop." The
latest discovery of adolescent biological deficiency follows a decade
of blaming youths for virtually every social ill.</TE>
<TE>   To test a theory, compare what it predicts to real life. Decades
of psychological studies have exposed common typecasts of teens as a
"stubborn, fixed set of falsehoods," concluded University of Michigan
psychologist Joseph B. Adelson. In truth, "adolescents are not in
turmoil, not deeply disturbed, not at the mercy of their impulses,
not resistant to parental values ... and not rebellious." UC San
Francisco medical-psychologist Nancy Adler's testing similarly found
that "adolescents are no less rational than adults." A Carnegie
Mellon University team reviewed 100 scholarly studies and reported
the "perception of relative invulnerability was no more pronounced
for adolescents than for adults."</TE>
<TE>   Northwestern University psychiatrist Daniel Offer's studies of
30,000 youths spanning three decades found virtually "no support for
adolescent turmoil" theories or hormonal debilities. Repeated surveys
show only 10% to 15% of teens report dissatisfaction with themselves,
their lives or their relationships with parents. "Decision-making for
teenagers is no different than decision-making for adults," Offer
concluded in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. A typical
research review in the journal Child Development reported that
"minors aged 14 were found to demonstrate a level of competency
equivalent to that of adults" in standard measures of reasoning.</TE>
<TE>   The similarity of teenage and adult thinking is further shown by
crime and health statistics. If teen brains are inherently flawed, we
would expect teenagers to engage in far riskier behavior than adults.
This is not the case, however. Compared with adults, teenagers have
higher rates of water-sports and traffic accidents but lower rates of
other major mishaps, like falls, drug and alcohol overdoses, drunken
driving and suicides. The risks of teens committing a crime,
contracting HIV/AIDS or becoming pregnant out of wedlock vary
radically by socioeconomic status and typically parallel those of
adults within their cultures, not teens of other cultures. "Our youth
are no healthier or sicker than we, their parents," Offer concluded.</TE>
<TE>   When asked to speculate on the mental health of average teenagers,
physicians and therapists tend to vastly overestimate adolescents'
pathology. A multi-university team reported that scientists and
adults, in general, erroneously "believe adolescent problems are more
attributable to 'developmental stage' than problems of older age
groups." That is, when a 16-year-old drives drunk or shoots up a
school, we blame generic teen recklessness; when a 40-year-old drives
drunk or shoots up an office, we view him as a disturbed individual.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its dubious validity, the stigma of biological inferiority
allows varied interests both to abrogate teen rights and impose harsh
punishments on them. Liberal lobbies such as Amnesty International
and New York University's Brennan Center for Justice defend trying
youths in juvenile rather than adult court on the ground of youths'
supposed developmental incompetence; yet they ignore data showing
that juvenile-court judges sentence teens to longer terms than
similarly offending adults. Conservatives cite adolescent immaturity
to justify zero-tolerance and abstinence-only, far more demanding
standards than adults face.</TE>
<TE>   Deploring "unsubstantiated claims about the incompetence of
adolescents," Carnegie Mellon researchers suggest reversing the lens
and scrutinizing adults' "cognitive and motivational factors that
promote this harsh view of adolescents." Could generic flaws in
grown-up thinking explain the reckless compulsion of authorities who
hurl simplistic stereotypes at powerless groups, the servile
conformity of experts who cloak them in science and the smugness of
the rest of us who swallow them?</TE>

<KH>GOVERNOR'S RACE</KH>
<HD>The Art of Political Inclusion, Texas-Style</HD>
<DH>Two Mexican Americans, one a former golden boy, the other a
$600-million man, are going head to head.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUBEN NAVARRETTE JR.</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>At a time when Latinos in other parts of the country are starving to
elect more of their own to high office, Texas has laid out a feast.
This year, in the Lone Star State, there are nine Latinos running for
statewide office.</LD>
<LD>   And two--oil businessman A.R. "Tony" Sanchez Jr. and former state
Atty. Gen. Dan Morales--are aiming for the top. Both are slugging it
out for the Democratic nomination and the chance to square-off
against Republican Gov. Rick Perry. If either Sanchez or Morales
beats Perry, he will make history by becoming Texas' first Latino
governor since the days of the Alamo.</LD>
<LD>   But at least as interesting as the fact that there are two Latinos
vying for the governorship is how there came to be two in the first
place. That story begins last September, when Sanchez, a regent for
the University of Texas, announced his candidacy. The timing was
perfect. Some Democrats, still smarting from the mugging they got
from Gov. George W. Bush in his 1998 reelection, in which he took
nearly 50% of the Latino vote, were warming up to the idea of running
a Latino at the top of the ticket as the surest way to keep Latino
voters from straying off the hacienda.</LD>
<TE>   Not that there was any consensus that Sanchez should be that
candidate. Some Democrats preferred Henry G. Cisneros, who had just
moved back to San Antonio from Los Angeles, where he had served as
president and chief executive of the television network Univision.
Cisneros was asked repeatedly if he was interested in the job, and
repeatedly he said "no."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Cisneros said he was going to support Sanchez. Even with
that valuable endorsement, Sanchez is a first-time candidate whose
political base is the modest border town of Laredo--his hometown and
that of seven generations of forebears. And so, his campaign might
have been dismissed with a smirk by Democratic Party bigwigs if not
for one thing: a personal fortune estimated to be in the (highly
exclusive) neighborhood of $600 million.</TE>
<TE>   That bankroll represents the fruits of Sanchez O'Brien Oil &amp; Gas
Corp., a successful energy-exploration company that Sanchez launched
with his now-deceased father nearly 30 years ago, and a series of
profitable ventures since, including investments in banks throughout
south Texas.</TE>
<TE>   More impressive to Democrats was Sanchez' pledge to spend as much
as $30 million of it to pay his way in a battle against Perry. That
assurance, together with the millions of dollars that Sanchez had
contributed to Democratic candidates over the years, largely cleared
the field of Democratic challengers.</TE>
<TE>   But with a state this big, there is always someone who doesn't get
the memo. In this case, that someone is Morales.</TE>
<TE>   Once the golden boy of Texas politics, Morales spent last fall
telling reporters that he was planning to run for the U.S. Senate
against Republican Phil Gramm. Morales didn't seem concerned about
the cloud under which he had retired from politics in 1998. Actually,
it was less a cloud than a smoke ring.</TE>
<TE>   Texas' participation in the multibillion-dollar lawsuit against
tobacco firms put $17.3 billion into state coffers that year. It also
put Morales in hot water with state and federal officials, who have
investigated allegations that Morales, in utilizing the services of
private attorneys in the tobacco case, funneled millions in legal
fees to a lawyer friend. Morales denies any wrongdoing and says the
issue has been kept alive by political foes intent on keeping him out
of politics.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the September surprise. On the same day that Sanchez
crisscrossed Texas in his private jet to announce his candidacy,
Gramm called it a Senate career and announced that he would step down
at the end of this term. Within weeks, more names were mentioned as
likely candidates for the Democratic Senate nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Among them were Rep. Ken Bentsen of Houston, the nephew of Lloyd
Bentsen, the former U.S. senator and Treasury secretary, and Ron
Kirk, who, in 1995, became the first African American elected mayor
of Dallas, with 62% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   The Kirk candidacy sent Democrats' imagination into overdrive.
There was talk of a "rainbow ticket"--Sanchez for governor, Kirk for
Senate and a former state comptroller named John Sharp, a white male,
running for lieutenant governor.</TE>
<TE>   But before Kirk could complete the rainbow, he had to defeat at
least two likely opponents, each with higher name recognition. Worse,
while Morales had not yet formally entered the race, he was
outscoring Kirk in polls of likely Democratic voters.</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats didn't just have one Mexican American too many; they
had the potential of outright racial conflict.</TE>
<TE>   In Texas, as elsewhere, many assume that gains for Latinos mean
losses for African Americans. That doesn't go down well with the
racial group formerly known as the nation's largest minority. Worried
that, if Kirk was not on the ballot, African Americans, a loyal
constituency, would "go fishing" on election day, party leaders
decreed that Morales had to be kept out of the race.</TE>
<TE>   Even Morales' old friend Cisneros tried to talk him out of running
for the Senate, for the "good of the party."</TE>
<TE>   As you can see, for Texas Democrats, it takes an awful lot of
effort to make ethnic inclusion look this natural.</TE>
<TE>   Then it happened. Morales started hearing rumors from fellow
Democrats that the Kirk campaign was getting support from the
"Sanchez for Governor" effort. What kind of support was never clear,
but at the very least, Sanchez had made public his preference for
Kirk.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, Morales became convinced that the $600-million man was
trying to undermine him--for the sake of the rainbow.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez dismisses the charge as the paranoid fabrication of a
once-popular political figure who, overnight, found himself without
two Democratic Party supporters to rub together.</TE>
<TE>   But Morales was sure he was being sent a message, and he decided
to send one back.</TE>
<TE>   So, on the day of the filing deadline, in a move that sent a
tremor through Texas politics, Morales abandoned talk of the Senate
and instead filed paperwork to run for governor--against Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   Morales' thinking seemed to be that if he was going to find
himself, in effect, running against Sanchez no matter where he
appeared on the ballot, then he might as well run against him
head-on.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez was not pleased. He called Morales a "desperate" man with
no race to call his own. Morales fired back that the party's
nomination should not be up for auction.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with less than a month to go until the March 12 Democratic
primary, a Dallas Morning News poll finds Sanchez, buoyed by some $10
million in to-date campaign spending and a statewide media blitz of
television and radio ads, favored by 36% of likely Democratic voters.
Morales is the choice of 28%. About one-third of voters are
undecided.</TE>
<TE>   Among Latinos, Sanchez is outscoring Morales, by a ratio of nearly
2-to-1. The reason might have something to do with the recent debate
over which man is the best Mexican American.</TE>
<TE>   This is Sanchez's doing. He has repeatedly reminded Latinos that
it was Morales, as Texas attorney general, who expanded the 1996
Hopwood ruling, which barred racial preferences at the University of
Texas at Austin, to all Texas state colleges.</TE>
<TE>   The bad news for Democrats is that the poll also finds that, no

all, this is Texas, where politics offer a little bit of
everything--except predictability.</TE>

<HD>Iraq Attack Would Distract Us from Al Qaeda</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Since the president named Iraq part of an "axis of evil" in his State
of the Union address last month, the drums of war have grown louder
in Washington. Senior administration officials, congressional leaders
and pundits have taken aim at Iraq, insisting that military action
will likely be necessary. Secretary of State Colin Powell, commonly
viewed as a voice of restraint in the administration, now suggests
that taking on Iraq militarily might be something the U.S. will "have
to do alone." Concurrently, the Pentagon is shifting its regional
military command structures to the Persian Gulf.</LD>
<LD>   Moving the war on terrorism to Iraq is tempting. Saddam Hussein's
ruthless and autocratic regime is both evil and dangerous. And the
country presents a more concrete--and therefore attractive--target
than an amorphous and diffuse terrorist organization. In Iraq, we
could deploy the full firepower of the U.S. military and would not
have to rely primarily on the CIA and special operations forces.
Targeting Iraq would also rectify what many see as the mistake of
allowing Hussein to remain in power at the conclusion of Desert
Storm.</LD>
<LD>   The problem with making Iraq the next target is this: It was Al
Qaeda, not Iraq, that perpetrated the terrorism of Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   While now largely dislodged from Afghanistan, Al Qaeda remains an
active and potent force with perhaps thousands of operatives
worldwide. As far as we know, Osama bin Laden is alive. His alleged
chief of operations, Palestinian Abu Zubaydah, is believed to be
actively plotting Al Qaeda's next strikes. Further raising the
stakes, documents recovered from Al Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan
indicate that Bin Laden has been pursuing the development of
biological and nuclear weapons. Owing to the generous financial
support of sympathetic Saudis and Kuwaitis, a cut of the narcotics
trade in Afghanistan and funding through shell charities, Al Qaeda
and affiliated radical Islamic organizations can draw on resources
estimated at $5 billion to $15 billion. And the group's primary focus
is to inflict further harm on Americans.</TE>
<TE>   As was made clear by last week's FBI warning of an imminent attack
by a suspected Bin Laden-affiliated group, Al Qaeda, not Iraq, is the
primary threat we face. Acknowledging the primacy of this danger, CIA
Director George Tenet stated publicly earlier this month that Al
Qaeda remains "the most immediate and serious threat" the country
faces. Military action against Iraq would distract from this threat.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem with taking the war to Iraq is that it would
undermine a strategic objective in the war on terrorism: to shape a
more secure global system by raising the standards of global conduct.
We are asking the world to buy in to an elevated set of global norms:
the unconditional rejection of terrorism, respect for the rule of law
and a ban on the proliferation of biological, chemical and nuclear
weapons materials. We're pushing countries toward religious tolerance
and more legitimate democratic processes. Why? Because bolstering
these conventions gets at the roots of terrorism. How we conduct the
next phase of the war will go a long way toward determining the
extent to which these norms are advanced.</TE>
<TE>   If we hope to change global norms, we must uphold the moral
authority that the United States has historically held in the eyes of
the world. By shifting the war on terrorism to Iraq, we open
ourselves to charges of opportunism. This would cost us the support
not only of our European partners, but also of our nontraditional
allies in the developing world--allies indispensable to rooting out
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Support from the developing world will only grow in importance
during the war on terrorism's next phase. Al Qaeda will likely not
reconstitute the nerve center of its operations in a single country,
however convenient we might find that. Rather, it will evolve into an
even less hierarchal organization, the better to blend into the
social fabric of the nations in which it operates. While invaluable,
our superior intelligence technology will be insufficient to the task
of finding and neutralizing the group's operatives. We need
intelligence on the ground, people who can move in and out of these
same communities, infiltrate and expose Al Qaeda cells. Such agents
will not be Americans, but members of foreign intelligence agencies
who can better blend in. The depth of our allies' commitment to this
effort (beyond pro-forma public pronouncements) will ultimately come
down to how aligned they feel with the global order the U.S. is
shaping.</TE>
<TE>   While the U.S. military is certainly capable of toppling the Iraqi
regime, taking such action now would damage our ability to lead.
Genuine admiration for American values would be replaced by fear of
an unaccountable superpower ready to throw its weight around with or
without provocation. This would foster the creation of a new
coalition of states--rich and poor--that would seek to undermine U.S.
power at every turn.</TE>
<TE>   A further strategic consideration in a war against Iraq is its
impact on relations with our longtime rivals, Russia and China.
September's terrorist attacks so shook up international relations
that a vision of common interests with both countries now seems both
possible and desirable. If the U.S. were now to move on Iraq
militarily without demonstrating that it has links to Sept. 11,
domestic debates in both Russia and China would likely tilt in favor
of hard-liners, effectively torpedoing nascent cooperative
arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   It's possible, of course, that President Bush has evidence
connecting Iraq to the attacks. But if this is the case, then such
evidence must be presented. At the very least, the Bush
administration needs to explain how Iraq represents a greater
immediate threat to the United States than the as-yet undefeated Al
Qaeda network. Otherwise, we risk letting our anger at Hussein get in
the way of our strategic aims. We also jeopardize diffusing our
military, intelligence and diplomatic energies in a way that prevents
us from being successful against either Iraq or Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   In the days after the September terrorist attacks, when informed
that Al Qaeda was operational in some 60 countries around the world,
President Bush reportedly responded, "Let's pick them off one at a
time." And he was right. Such an operation will require painstaking
planning and execution, but it is crucial.</TE>
<TE>   The American public, still seething over Sept. 11, has shown great
willingness to support the commander in chief in whatever direction
he decides to take this war. But with this trust comes a great
responsibility on the part of the president and his advisors to keep
the strategic picture in mind. Military action against Iraq might be
more satisfying than restraint in the short term, but the president
must be certain that such action at this time would be ultimately in
the national interest as well.</TE>

<KH>LOS ANGELES</KH>
<HD>The Dark Side of Good Government</HD>
<DH>Los Angeles is in the midst of a half-finished revolution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>D. J. WALDIE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bland, Progressive-Era mask that has been the face of city
government in Los Angeles since the 1920s is cracking, but not fast
enough to reveal the comprehending human face that Angelenos seek.
Unless the city falls to a revolution of popularity--unless Angelenos
soon see more of their complexions and conditions when they look at
the apparatus of city government--the only loyalty to Los Angeles
left may be nostalgia. Perhaps not at the ballot box, where breaking
up Los Angeles can be defeated, but in the hearts of the city, where
it actually matters--the idea of secession will have won.</LD>
<LD>   It's a hopeful sign that recent opinion polling shows that enough
hearts in the city are still undecided. I imagine among those most
torn by conflicting allegiances to what Los Angeles is and what it
might be is Mayor James K. Hahn. He has appointed an activist general
manager to administer the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment, and
Greg Nelson's passion for his new job could restart the
popularization of civic life that has drifted since City Charter
amendments were approved in 1999. But the mayor also has made too
many safe appointments to a welter of policy-setting boards and
commissions--nearly 60 of them in the city's unaccountable
administrative structure. His choices perpetuate the hegemony over
L.A.'s future of the lucky Angelenos who are both good and
well-connected.</LD>
<TE>   The members of those boards and commissions were once the city's
rebels. Eighty years ago, municipal government in Los Angeles was so
rank with corruption that good citizens rose up against it. Some were
shot at. One reformer was nearly blown to bits by a bomb planted by
an L.A. police captain. The good citizens resisted, and with skills
honed in the popular movements of the Progressive Era--slum
clearance, women's suffrage and the temperance crusade--a generation
of reformers legislated enough purity into City Hall by 1945 that Los
Angeles had "good government."</TE>
<TE>   Goodness, however, came at the expense of popularity. The civic
apparatus the reformers adopted was based on a deep mistrust of
elected officials and infinite confidence in people who were just
like the reformers. The appointed boards and commissions that
replaced corruptible politicians built the facilities and delivered
the services that supported the city's widening suburban fringe. More
cheaply and efficiently than any other big city, Los Angeles supplied
its residents with water, electricity, streets, parks, police
protection, libraries and trash collection, but with the dispassion
of a utility. That was the model intended by the city's "revolution
of reform" in 1925--city government as a well-run public utility--and
its success inevitably turned citizens, otherwise burdened with the
messy relationships required of real citizenship, into mere consumers
of municipal services.</TE>
<TE>   It's the system that Hahn's 20 years at City Hall as controller
and city attorney trained him to serve, which explains why he so
often projects the image of a dutiful corporate president fronting
for an anonymous board of directors. After all, the good and
well-connected people he's appointed to five-year terms on the city's
boards and commissions are just public-spirited volunteers, only
part-time executives of city departments (except for public works
commissioners) and all un-elected. The system is supposed to shield
its citizen managers behind the political screen of the mayor's
office.</TE>
<TE>   The system of anonymity is still working. Drill down through the
city's intranet pages, as I did last week, and you'll eventually find
links to some, but not all, of the city's boards and commissions, and
drilling deeper, you'll find that some, but not many, of the rosters
of board members and commissioners come with biographies and
photographs that actually give features to the smooth, unyielding
surface of city government. It shows a face not many working-class
Angelenos will recognize as theirs.</TE>
<TE>   It really doesn't make much difference if the appointments are
among the 114 Hahn has made so far or the nearly 200 who remain as
former Mayor Richard Riordan holdovers. In both administrations, city
departments are managed and city policies are made by middle-class
residents (somewhat more than half of whom are male) who mostly live
in the Santa Monica Mountains, the Westside and the well-off
communities of northwest San Fernando Valley. Race, always mistaken
as the only defining boundary in Los Angeles, hardly counts. The best
predictor of who sits on a city board or commission isn't color; it's
(in ascending order) a job in a public-interest "strategic
communications" firm, a law degree, or a history of past service on
some other board or commission.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that Hahn has appointed supporters (and past and future
campaign contributors) or members of his political party--all mayors
have done that. What makes the fabric of civic life in Los Angeles
look so threadbare is that these well-connected people connect more
to the apparatus they serve than to the life of their city. The
management of everyday government in Los Angeles--on the level of
parking tickets, building permits and library books--is brought to
you by earnest and well-intentioned volunteers who turn out to be
lobbyists, lawyers and members of the city's semi-pro commissariat.</TE>
<TE>   They're good at their jobs, as just about everyone at City Hall
is, but still the city threatens to tear itself to shreds.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is in the midst of a half-finished revolution of
popularity. The city now has cleaner lines of authority for city
department heads and a clearer separation of powers between the City
Council and a stronger mayor's office. But Los Angeles doesn't have a
bigger council, an expansion of popular government left out of the
charter reforms. Because the structure of city government still
resists being human-scaled, porous and neighborhood-specific, the
disconnection between city streets and City Hall persists.</TE>
<TE>   I once thought that the network of neighborhood councils promised
in the 1999 charter amendments would eventually balance the weight of
all those well-connected people with a corps of well-informed citizen
stakeholders connected to actual neighborhoods and standing up for a
lively cacophony of competing, small-scale interests. I thought that
civic life might be reclaimed in Los Angeles street by street. I'm
not so sure now. Nelson and the Department of Neighborhood
Empowerment have 184 neighborhood councils to shepherd through the
application and confirmation process, and only a handful have been
confirmed by the Board of Neighborhood Commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   Border disputes have broken out as new councils jostle for turf in
Glassell Park, the arts district and in South-Central. Some council
organizers look suspiciously like developers, particularly in
Chinatown, and others look like fronts for NIMBYist homeowner
associations or spokesmen with narrow agendas. Some organizers are
simply losing heart with the difficulties of giving government in Los
Angeles a human face. Just defining a neighborhood has proven harder
than it seemed, as residents find that no one at City Hall knows
where one neighborhood begins and another ends in fluid L.A. There's
not enough staff for the empowerment department, not enough training
for aspirant neighborhood councilors, not enough experience all
around, and almost no time left for the new councils to learn where
their power lies and how to use it.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn knows that time is running out, prodded by his sister
Janice--a member of the City Council and an early advocate of
neighborhood councils. More important, the man he appointed to head
the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment knows it, but Nelson has
the optimism of a true revolutionary. Even though organized
neighborhood advocacy unsettles the tight relationships between
council members and City Hall lobbyists, he expects the City Council
as a whole to welcome vocal and effective neighborhood councilors.
Even though no formal procedure exists for neighborhood councilors to
advise Hahn on city budget priorities, Nelson expects one soon (but
probably not soon enough to affect the next city budget). Even though
no one knows if the well-connected volunteers who sit on city boards
and commissions can relate to the feisty new volunteers who represent
neighborhoods, Nelson still expects the mongrel system to work.</TE>
<TE>   It must. The city's indifferent civic apparatus, designed to work
behind a mask of obscurity, needs a revolution of popular desire as
thorough as the one that cleaned up a rotten city 80 years ago.
Unless popular government overthrows merely good government in Los
Angeles, the succeeding revolution will leave a permanently fractured
metropolis.</TE>

<LD>I'm at the dinner table with volunteers in the AmeriCorps. You may
recall that George W. Bush has opened a lively spat in the GOP
between "values conservatives" and "anti-government conservatives."
Trying to provide focus to our mood of unity, the president proposed
expanding AmeriCorps, the domestic version of the Peace Corps. Few
things better typify old bedrock values of duty and service.</LD>
<LD>   But the government bashers won't stand for it. Led by the likes of
GOP House leader Dick Armey of Texas--who argued that the charitable
spirit is incompatible with government subsidies and financing--they
are out to block the path. I guess they fear nothing like the
possibility that government success will prove them wrong.</LD>
<LD>   What do the women and men of AmeriCorps have to say to Armey and
his bunch?</LD>
<TE>   Stephanie Wisniewski: "How can you be for taking care of our
country if you're not for taking care of our community?"</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie grew up with the working poor in suburban Hanover Park,
Ill. Her mom could fix anything, a fact that shaped Stephanie's
aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   Working three jobs, she put herself through college and has a
bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin. But before she
seeks a career in film, she had a childhood dream: to build houses
for the working poor.</TE>
<TE>   "I've waited for this since I was a kid," she beams, fresh from a
house construction site with a grimy face, dirty T-shirt and a smile
of someone who invested sweat equity into her own satisfaction. "As
far as we know, we only live once so we might as well do something
that fills you up."</TE>
<TE>   At 26, Stephanie is an AmeriCorps volunteer for Habitat for
Humanity in a program called Direct, the hammer-and-nails end of
things. Her one-year contract pays her less than the minimum wage as
a gofer, team leader, troubleshooter and rally-the-troops energizer.</TE>
<TE>   She likes it so much that she is about to sign up for another
year; time for a career later.</TE>
<TE>   Adrianna Hosford: "When the president has upon people to come
forward and volunteer, and there are people willing to do it, the
government should facilitate. If we didn't have programs like
AmeriCorps, we'd see a lot more problems in our society. I think the
people in opposition are those who have never volunteered."</TE>
<TE>   Adrianna grew up well-to-do in Huntington Beach. Her family is
conservative but community-minded. She earned a bachelor's degree
from Chapman University, working as an educational aide at a blind
children's learning center. She is bound for graduate school and
wanted to add some more experience to her resume. She could have
taken a salaried job with a top-notch PR firm. Instead, she enrolled
for a year as an AmeriCorps Vista volunteer for less than minimum
wage. She is designing a communications and special events program
for Habitat.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, I don't feel particularly like it's a choice. This has
been my breeding," she says. "If you have the gift for helping
people, it's sort of your responsibility to use it."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Wright says of Armey: "He's selfish and narrow-minded."</TE>
<TE>   Bob is 75 and ran his own engineering and construction business
for 20 years out of Park City, Utah. "Why volunteer? I didn't want to
retire and just do nothing. I don't think there is any real benefit
to living hedonistically."</TE>
<TE>   Wright and his wife were headed for the Peace Corps when they
learned of the alternative of domestic service through AmeriCorps.
They moved to Long Beach, where he is the volunteer property
acquisitions coordinator for Habitat. His wife works for the public
library.</TE>
<TE>   Today, there are 50,000 AmeriCorps volunteers like these providing
person-power, expertise and energy to thousands of community
programs, some private and others governmental.</TE>
<TE>   Armey thinks the idea is "obnoxious." On his congressional Web
site, this leading conservative theorist warns: "While liberals have
been extraordinarily successful at convincing the public of their
higher motives, these higher motives are usually used to conceal
their own greed."</TE>
<TE>   So what do you say to Armey and those who follow in line with him?</TE>
<TE>   I'll say this: Mr. Armey, you're known around Washington as a
poker player. Let's stack your words up against those expressed by
these three AmeriCorps volunteers. Or any random three.</TE>
<TE>   Then we'll put it to a vote. Who will come out looking greedy?
Whose vision expresses American values? How much is the honorable
gentleman willing to bet?</TE>

<LD>It's no surprise that a political undercurrent to the standoff
between Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks is the possibility that the city's next police chief could be a
Latino. What is surprising is that it took city leaders so long to
reach such an obvious conclusion.</LD>
<LD>   L.A. has been ready for a Latino police chief for years. A few
numbers help make the point:</LD>
<LD>   At the end of July 2001, the LAPD had 8,966 sworn personnel. Fewer
than half of those officers, 4,084, are white. There are 1,232 black
and 477 Asian officers. And more than one-third of the force--3,004
officers--is Latino.</LD>
<TE>   Harder to quantify, but no less revealing, are two points made by
knowledgeable sources in local law enforcement:</TE>
<TE>   * Roughly one-half of LAPD's patrol officers--the street cops who
handle most of the initial contact with civilians--are Latino.</TE>
<TE>   * Latinos apply for police work in big numbers. Latino youngsters,
especially those from conservative immigrant families, look upon law
enforcement as an attractive and honorable career.</TE>
<TE>   This is why city political leaders finally are talking about the
likelihood that Hahn will seek Latino candidates for chief to deflect
the criticism he's getting from African Americans for not supporting
Parks' bid for a second term.</TE>
<TE>   The political equations work in Hahn's favor. The Latino vote is
growing while the number of black voters--a traditional base of his
support--is declining. Then there's the matter of the nasty campaign
Hahn ran last year to defeat former state Assembly Speaker Antonio
Villaraigosa. A Latino police chief wouldn't erase memories of that
battle, but it might ease the sting.</TE>
<TE>   So City Hall is abuzz with the names of Latinos whom Hahn might
approach as a replacement for Parks, if the Police Commission agrees
that the chief's contract should not be renewed.</TE>
<TE>   Topping the list is the department's highest-ranking Latino,
Deputy Chief David Gascon. A 31-year veteran of the force, Gascon is
Parks' chief of staff and may be too loyal to campaign for his job.</TE>
<TE>   That opens the field for candidates such as Cmdr. George Gascon
(no relation to David), an 18-year veteran who heads LAPD training
programs, and Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez, who spent 27 years with
the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, these candidates, and any others associated with the
LAPD, must overcome the uneasiness critics feel toward anyone who
came up through the ranks. Are insiders too much the products of a
notoriously insular culture to shake up a department plagued by
scandals and poor morale?</TE>
<TE>   I share those qualms. But my doubts have been somewhat eased by
the recent performance of a veteran Latino lawman who for years was
the candidate Latino activists wanted for the LAPD's top job: L.A.
County Sheriff Lee Baca.</TE>
<TE>   Baca no longer wants the LAPD job. He's even endorsed Parks' bid
for another term. Baca got the job he wanted in 1998, when he
defeated former Sheriff Sherman Block, a seriously ill incumbent who
died days before the election. It was a painful campaign for Baca,
who had to run against a former mentor by pointing to scandals that
rivaled some of the LAPD's.</TE>
<TE>   The 37-year Sheriff's Department veteran did not try to mend
fences with the old-boy network after he won. Instead, he started
shaking things up. Just weeks after being sworn in, he transferred
problem deputies and a commander out of a troubled station in South
Los Angeles. And, in a move that won praise from even the toughest
local police critics, Baca began working with civil rights attorneys
to create an independent system of civilian oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Most political observers expect Baca to have little trouble
getting reelected this year. So, in a twist, the lawman who was
passed over twice for the LAPD's top job may have four more years to
stand as proof that the right insider--Latino or not--just might have
what it takes to fix the LAPD.</TE>

<HD>You Can't Skate Around the Politics of Human Nature</HD>
<DH>Sure, the Canadians won a gold, but the U.S. may lose in
the long run.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Justice was done."</LD>
<LD>   So said David Pelletier, the Canadian skater who, with his pair
partner, Jamie Sale, was promoted from silver-finisher to
gold-medalist by the damage-controlling International Olympic
Committee on Friday. By now, even those who don't know a double axel
from a double play, or a triple loop from a triple crown, know about
"skategate."</LD>
<LD>   But the conflict over the judging wasn't so much about justice as
it was about politics.</LD>
<TE>   To be sure, many observers thought that a Russian skating pair was
wrongly awarded the gold medal in the original competition Monday
night, but after the conflict came a compromise; both the Canadians
and the Russians will be gold medalists. And that's a reminder that,
in questions of human judgment, the answer is likely to be found in
human nature--which is to say, in politics. As Aristotle observed
2,400 years ago, "Man is by nature a political animal."</TE>
<TE>   Most Americans are probably happy for the Canadians. But is that a
case of Americans being fair-minded, or is it our rooting for our
friendly neighbors to the north?</TE>
<TE>   For their part, the Russians see the flap differently.</TE>
<TE>   A correspondent for Tass complained, "The controversy was
initially fueled by NBC commentator Sandra Bezic, a former Canadian
pairs skater who openly was rooting for the Canadians."</TE>
<TE>   And in Moscow, the daily Trud called the scandal a "soap opera in
a glass of dirty water."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the most senior woman in the Russian government
announced she was heading to Salt Lake City "to support the moral
spirit of our team."</TE>
<TE>   An American might say that Russians are making political hay out
of the Olympic issue, but of course, a Russian might say in response
that American President Bush, the star of the opening ceremony, had
already made big hay.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, it does appear that the skating judges misbehaved. And
happily, unlike, say, the notorious "long count" in the
Dempsey-Tunney fight of 1927, or the much-instant-replayed "safe"
call at first base in the sixth game of the 1985 World Series, some
degree of adjustment--justice, even--can be made.</TE>
<TE>   To put it another way, if there's a political aspect to a problem,
there's a political aspect to the solution. Other organizations also
often make decisions with an eye toward a reasonable balance, not
righteous absolutes. For instance, the actor John Wayne had never won
an Oscar after four decades of movie work. Realizing that he was
owed, Hollywood finally awarded him one in 1969. In 1974, the Nobel
Prize for economics was awarded jointly to two graybeards, Gunnar
Myrdal and Friedrich Hayek, even though the socialist Myrdal and the
libertarian Hayek had diametrically opposite views on every economic
question. And in 1999, after her 18-times unrequited quest had become
a saga of its own, Susan Lucci finally got her Emmy for "All My
Children."</TE>
<TE>   Even loftier subjects can't escape the grubby clutches of human
nature. Two great 17th century mathematicians, Isaac Newton and
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, feuded for decades over who deserved
credit for inventing calculus. To this day, historians of science
weigh out the evidence, although the fact that few Americans have
ever heard of Leibniz suggests that Newton's spin has prevailed--at
least in the English-speaking world.</TE>
<TE>   But if the Canadians won their political battle for Olympic gold,
the Americans who supported them may end up losing another political
battle--for the Olympics themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Times reported on Feb. 6 of a "deep undercurrent"
within the IOC of "resentment toward a perceived American arrogance."</TE>
<TE>   Amplifying that theme, the Manchester Guardian reported on Friday
that "the wave of American jingoism and intense security has led to
senior officials of the International Olympic Committee privately
expressing concerns about whether the U.S. can ever stage another
Olympic event." And the Sydney Morning Herald compared the Salt Lake
City games to the Nazi propaganda-fest staged in Berlin in 1936.</TE>
<TE>   Most Americans will find that comparison outrageous, but that's
human nature for you--that humans see things in different ways and
can be stubborn about what they see. And the perception that
Americans are domineering overdogs has set in--at least among
non-Americans.</TE>
<TE>   This year, a kind of political justice made Canada a winner. But
in the years to come--in the judging of events, in the location of
the games themselves--Americans may find themselves on the losing
side of Olympic politics.</TE>

<LD>Let's say you're talking foreign policy with Colin Powell (or
whispering sweet nothings to your sweetheart) when Bullwinkle Moose
appears on a television in the room. If your attention wanders to the
screen, you're hardly alone.</LD>
<LD>   As the authors of research published in this month's Scientific
American admit, they too often find themselves succumbing to the
tube's almost occult ability to seize people's attention and not let
go. They cite, as an example, a UC Berkeley professor who confesses
to having many "embarrassing moments ... when I am engaged in
conversation in a room while a TV set is on, and I cannot for the
life of me stop from periodically glancing over to the screen. This
occurs not only during dull conversations but during reasonably
interesting ones just as well."</LD>
<LD>   In the article, Robert Kubey, a media studies professor at
Rutgers, and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a psychology professor at
Claremont Graduate School, offer a gripping explanation of how images
and sounds from the small screen seduce us by evoking a biological
reaction that has been wired into our brains over millions of years
of evolution.</LD>
<TE>   The researchers are hardly the first to describe the "orienting
response," which dilates blood vessels to the brain, slows the heart
and constricts blood vessels to major muscle groups at the sight of
sudden or novel stimuli. Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov studied it
back in 1927, recognizing it as an adaptive response that evolved to
help our ancestors vigilantly scan the environment for lions and
other threats.</TE>
<TE>   However, Kubey and Csikszentmihalyi are among the first academics
to "out" the science of media manipulation in the popular press.
Previously, you had to look in publications like Advertising Age to
learn how the orienting response can be evoked by such simple TV
tricks as quick cuts, zooms, pans and sudden noises. The authors
deserve cheers for exposing some of advertisers' secrets, thus
nipping at the hand that gives lucrative grants to many media studies
institutes today.</TE>
<TE>   These mavericks' research is hardly on a par with curing cancer.
But it could, in a sense, add years to someone's life. Take, for
instance, this typically common-sense observation: "Viewers often
know that a particular program or movie of the week is not very good
within the first few minutes but instead of switching off the set,
they stick with it for the full two hours." Learn to break that
pattern and you might wind up spending less time in front of the tube
than the average person in the industrialized world--a full nine
years of life.</TE>
<TE>   Here's our tip for making the change: Get a clue--Bullwinkle is
not a real threat.</TE>

<LD>Re "Farmers Market Putting on Ritz," Feb. 8: Farmers Market is where
time has stood still. For this tactless Frenchman, Stephan Strouk, to
lash out at the longtime merchants ("They're not really, really
businesspeople") is crass. His plan, which apparently is to replace
the southeast corner market that could have appeared in "Double
Indemnity" with a 7,000-square-foot international gourmet market, is
Farmers Market's death knell. Just bulldoze the place so he can have
50,000 square feet.</LD>

<HD>No Safe Harbor for Pollution</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Many thanks for "Finally Tackling L.A.'s Worst Air Polluter" (Feb.
10). While it is stunning enough to realize that the ships calling in
the harbor produce as much air pollution as 1 million cars, the
health risks of diesel pollution are much greater than those of an
equal number of cars.</LD>
<LD>   Diesel exhaust has been declared a toxic air contaminant and
carcinogen by the state of California. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency's goal for cancer risk being increased due to toxic
air contaminants is one part per 1 million of population. According
to the multiple air toxics study done by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District, the risk stands at 1,500 per 1 million in
Wilmington and only slightly less in Long Beach and San Pedro.</LD>
<LD>   One of the best commentaries on this issue was in "5 Pollutants
Are Listed as Most Toxic to Children" (June 16), which reported that
"Diesel exhaust is one of the most damaging pollutants affecting
children in California, according to an advisory panel of some of the
state's top scientists."</LD>
<TE>   The Port of Los Angeles has been aware of this situation for
years. It has concealed material facts from the public and sacrificed
the public health in its mindless drive to expand. If this pollution
continues to grow, many people will become ill, and some will die.
Mayor James Hahn appoints the Harbor Commission and has the final say
on the policies of the port. The ultimate responsibility is his.</TE>

<TE>   I agree it's about time we focus on reducing all the ships' air
pollution. I work as an air quality consultant, and when I read your
statistic of a whopping four tons of nitrogen oxide per day per cargo
ship, I was disgusted.</TE>
<TE>   My recommendation is to implement a thorough annual emissions
inventory from each ship coming into the port(s) throughout
California and Mexico's Pacific ports. Tag each inventory report with
the existing emission fees and pool all collected money into a fund.
This fund will cover cash-back incentives and discounts to individual
ship owners and operators who use 50% cleaner-burning bunker fuel.
The level of cleaner fuel achieved can be implemented in phases,
effective immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: The cost to control the emissions can always be
developed to be much cheaper than the profit gained from the billions
of dollars in imported goods arriving each day. It's about time and
it's good for all of us.</TE>

<HD>Teacher Rings In Classes With an Announcement</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a cell phone rang in one of my high school classes two days in
a row, I now begin classes with the same announcements made before
the start of a theatrical performance: "Ladies and gentlemen, please
turn off your cell phones and your pagers, and put the food away
because when you eat in class it sounds like this," as I crinkle an
empty potato chip bag. They respond by complying.</LD>
<LD>   As for the two young ladies who received the calls--one from her
grandmother and the other from her boyfriend--I sent them to the
office with a discipline referral in hand for "class disruption."
Their embarrassment was probably punishment enough, but they also
received three detentions and a notation on their file in the office.</LD>
<LD>   If parents really need to check up on the whereabouts of their
kids, I would think a land phone would be necessary. Call the school
attendance office and ask whether so-and-so is in class. The cell
phone could be at the beach!</LD>
<TE>   "Schools' Cell Phone Ban May End" (Feb. 8) is right on, of course.
There are so many cell phones on my high school campus that the law
is impossible to enforce without metal detectors, and that wouldn't
do any good either. The kids would just pass them to each other
through the fence. It's time for the schools to come up to the 21st
century. We had drug dealers on campuses long before the cell phone.</TE>

<HD>Nations Demonized as an 'Axis of Evil'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George W. Bush loves to use the term "evil," just as Ronald Reagan
did when he called the Soviet Union an "evil empire." A religious
term that stirs the emotions is much more powerful in political
diatribe than rational discourse. However, I was dismayed to hear him
call Iran, Iraq and North Korea an "axis of evil." Bush seems intent
on antagonizing and isolating these regimes rather than engaging
them. When he took office, he refused to support South Korea's
attempts to open dialogue with North Korea. Recently, North Korea
requested a meeting with U.S. officials but canceled it after the
president's remark. Moderate Iranians have made friendly overtures to
the West, and the government cooperated in arresting militant
fundamentalists. Now they are so angry at the U.S. they are
demonstrating and carrying signs that read "Death to America" (Feb.
12).</LD>
<TE>   Why would this president deliberately provoke hatred instead of
friendship and dialogue? Why would he associate these three very
different nations? The answer lies in the central theme of his
campaign, which was to build a missile defense system. The government
can't spend billions of dollars on missile defense if it can't
produce enemies that might be capable of launching an ICBM. He can
safely demonize these small nations because he knows they pose little
threat and that a fearful public, already traumatized by Sept. 11,
will persuade a skeptical Congress to fund this irrational largess to
the military-industrial complex regardless of the fact that it has
nothing to do with the threat of terrorism.</TE>

<TE>   In "Iraq Calls Bush's Bluff on Weapons Scrutiny" (Commentary, Feb.
10), Scott Ritter exposes the hypocrisy in our government's feud with
Saddam Hussein. We are threatening military action, which means
bombing and killing more thousands of Iraqi civilians, on the highly
questionable premise that Iraq won't allow resumption of the weapons
inspections. The truth is that Iraq has offered to discuss that
matter with the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   One has to wonder why we Americans handle foreign relations with
big nations as well as we do and nearly always bungle when we deal
with the small nations. Might the answer have something to do with
bullying by the big guy?</TE>

<LD>"A Lonely Quest for Safer Cars" (Feb. 12) raises many specious
arguments while bypassing the point: 26,000 Americans are mangled or
killed in rollover accidents each year.</LD>
<LD>   Manufacturers do not offer roll bars or five-point seat belts as
options to car buyers. Do we know how to protect drivers in rollover
accidents? Sure. Look at the stock-car racers. How about a stronger
roof with an inch or two more headroom with better seat support and
multipoint seat belts? Drivers may spend a few dollars for real
safety--if offered. All cars can roll over in an accident.</LD>

<TE>   While reading about reinforcing automobile roofs, I thought about
all of the people under 21 years of age who died in the last year as
their cars left the roadway at 100-plus mph. Has anyone ever thought
why we need cars that go this fast and how many lives might have been
saved if cars were limited in their top-end speed? Last time I
checked, the speed limit was 35 mph on the streets and 65 mph on the
freeways.</TE>

<HD>Reshaping Journalism: The New Scalpel Wars</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>GALE HOLLAND</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The war on terrorism has spawned some heroic journalism in the face
of death. But it's also brought out the worst in journalism. I speak,
sadly, of my colleagues in broadcasting--not of their reporting, some
of which has been first rate, but of the style wars they've embarked
on.</LD>
<LD>   First, the buzz was about MSNBC's Ashleigh Banfield, she of the
trademark eyeglass frames, who made a huge splash by shading her
blonde shag a dull brunette, and donning a burka. The New York Times
dubbed her "a style icon." Then it was Paula Zahn, whose "just a
little bit sexy" ad campaign with the zipper soundtrack was pulled
after CNN--in a happy glare of publicity--shed crocodile tears.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the formerly obscure, sobersides legal commentator Greta Van
Susteren has landed the cover of People by getting an eye-tuck before
jumping from CNN to the Fox News Channel. To be sure, it was an eye
job preceded by a publicity campaign that made Fox News chieftain
Roger Ailes' previous PR coup, the Willie Horton campaign, look like
it was done by amateurs. But still, an eye job. Banfield must be
crying in her burka.</LD>
<TE>   The Battle of the Cable Network Narcissi is the big post-9/11
media story, and more is sure to come. What follows is a cautionary
tale of cable-news scalpel wars allowed to rage unchecked.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 18: Ashleigh Banfield parachutes into an Olympics medal
ceremony, her new double-D cup bust crowned by two lit Olympic
torches. She offers to mail the phone number of her surgeon to anyone
who switches over to her exclusive interview with Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat. Arafat extols Banfield's new look,
and MSNBC's ratings edge out Fox News Channel's.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 20: Paula Zahn launches her own infomercial campaign, "Some
of us don't need surgery." The 20-minute spots survey Zahn's previous
career as a beauty contestant: the triumphs, the defeats, the
poignant story of how she came to terms with a Miss Congeniality
award instead of first place. A highlight reel from Zahn's swimsuit
competitions is shown split-screen with testimonials from male stars,
including Ben Affleck and Buddy Hackett on why they prefer Zahn's
blond perkiness to that of Banfield or Van Susteren. The infomercial
ends with a fade-to-black shot of Zahn tugging at the oversized front
zipper of her black latex tank. CNN's ratings soar.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 22: Fox News chairman/ CEO Roger Ailes makes good on his
post-Van Susteren promise to "have my whole body done," appearing in
a guest spot on NBC's "Will and Grace" looking suspiciously like Ben
Affleck. Ailes announces mid-episode he will appear on the next day's
"The O'Reilly Factor," sending Fox's overnight numbers through the
roof.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 23: In despair over Ailes' coup, NBC News president Neal
Shapiro asks "Dateline NBC" Jane Pauley to undergo a chiseling. She
refuses, but her husband, Garry Trudeau, launches a new Doonesbury
comic-strip story line about a wartime plastic surgeon performing
media makeovers under fire. MSNBC's ratings drop below the Pet
Channel's.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 25: Ailes sends commentator Judith Regan to Van Susteren's
surgeon, and the publishing rep comes back looking like Britney
Spears. Taliban Mullah Mohammed Omar is captured on live TV, but
Ailes decides to stick with footage of Regan showing Bill O'Reilly
Spears' moves from the singer's Pepsi Superbowl commercial. Fox beats
CNN and MSNBC by a landslide.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 27: On rumors that NBC network president Andrew Lack has
ordered Katie Couric to submit to a sculpting, the "Today" show opens
to double ratings. Couric appears unchanged; Ailes files an unfair
competition charge with the Federal Communications Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 28: Osama bin Laden is led in chains out of the Empire State
Building, where he's been posing as a tour guide. But CNN News Group
Chairman Walter Isaacson declines to cut from Zahn's live report on
congressional testimony at the Botox legalization hearings from
Carmen Electra and Pamela Anderson. His judgment is confirmed when
CNN wins the coveted 18-35 male demographic, hands-down.</TE>
<TE>   March 3: Banfield sheds her trademark horn-rims and appears on air
with spooky fire-eye contact lens like shock rocker Marilyn Manson's.
The move backfires, and MSNBC's ratings dip below those of Pax-TV.</TE>
<TE>   March 5: In a valorous comeback, Banfield dons a rainbow wig,
rubber nose and bikini and discusses Brazilian waxing with
Condoleezza Rice. MSNBC ratings hit an all-time high.</TE>
<TE>   March 17: Christiane Amanpour undergoes her own, undisclosed
surgery, and CNN announces that she will henceforth appear under the
name Christopher Amanpour. "The only way to get respect on TV news is
as a man," she says.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Homeownership gains during the 1990s were the strongest since the
1950s, according to separate studies conducted by USC and the
nonprofit Fannie Mae Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   The USC study revealed that aging baby boomers were responsible
for most of the increase in the homeownership rate. As older baby
boomers moved from the 35-44 age group to the 45-54 group, they moved
from a group with a 66.2% homeownership rate to one with a 75.3%
rate.</LD>
<LD>   The Fannie Mae Foundation report found minority households were a
key factor behind strong growth in homeownership. The number of U.S.
homeowners reached 69.8 million in 2000, a gain of 10.8 million from
1990, the study said.</LD>
<TE>   Racial and ethnic minorities accounted for 40% of the increase, up
from 27% during the 1980s. Minorities accounted for more than 95% of
homeowner growth in California and Hawaii and 80% in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Favorable economic conditions, including low unemployment and
interest rates, and government and housing industry efforts to expand
homeownership also contributed to growth, the studies found.</TE>

<HD>Uniform Gardens Proposal May Grow Into Trouble</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN GLASSMAN and DONIE VANITZIAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I'm on my condominium board. We're in Valencia and have 48
units, each with a separate garden area.</LD>
<LD>   Our board president has embarked on a pet project where she wants
to landscape all the garden areas in front of each unit with a
"uniform appearance." She wants to install 48 sets of water lilies
and agapanthus where none existed before.</LD>
<LD>   These are not a low-cost, maintenance-free item, and they will
attract other problems such as mosquitoes.</LD>
<TE>   I am concerned about two things.</TE>
<TE>   First is the need for some owners to express themselves by having
a garden. Some owners are justifiably proud of all the trouble and
expense they have put into having beautiful gardens in front of their
unit.</TE>
<TE>   This has led to fewer complaints by homeowners because they feel
that they are a part of the association. But there are still a few
owners who don't care what their garden fronts look like.</TE>
<TE>   Second, there is a substantial additional expense to implement the
ambitious lily project that may include an assessment and higher
monthly fees to maintain them once installed. These plants must be
fertilized and watered on a regular basis with the castoffs being
removed immediately or they will die quickly.</TE>
<TE>   The association might have to hire a specialized type of gardener
to see to the needs of this new maintenance regime.</TE>
<TE>   I don't think the board should have the right to tear out
someone's garden after they have put in the hard work and money to
make it look attractive.</TE>
<TE>   I am afraid that if we take these gardens away from the owners,
they will direct their free time to making life miserable for the
board and the association.</TE>
<TE>   We are unsure if the individual gardens are regarded as "exclusive
use common interest" where the owners should have complete
responsibility, or if they are in the absolute control of the
association?</TE>
<TE>   What common sense advice can you give us?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Review your Covenants Conditions &amp; Restrictions to
determine whether the areas gardened by homeowners are part of the
common area or are designated as "exclusive use."</TE>
<TE>   If they are exclusive use areas, the individual owners can
basically control the planting in those plots, while if it is part of
the common area, the homeowner association is obligated to maintain
the area and can exercise control over the space.</TE>
<TE>   First, put your concerns in writing in advance of the next board
meeting. Second, demand that the board present a budget for the
project, both as to its creation and its ongoing maintenance to
determine whether or not the monthly dues will be increased to
accommodate this project. Third, request that the project along with
the budget be presented to all the homeowners for their input. Since
this new project may require an additional special assessment--either
to install, maintain or both--approval of the homeowners may also be
required.</TE>
<TE>   Your garden-variety board needs to recognize that these homeowners
have taken great pride in the appearance of their homes as seen
through the efforts in the garden areas. They have invested time and
expense to enhance the atmosphere of the entire complex by their
attention to the appearance of their individual areas while at the
same time adding to an otherwise sterile and "uniform" environment.</TE>
<TE>   As you have learned, the byproduct is that homeowners who are
"engaged" in their environment are least likely to complain.
Isolating these homeowners is the quickest road to dissension within
your complex. Ask if any of those already gardening may be interested
in assisting those who can't garden or arrange for those un-gardened
fronts to be tended by the association's gardeners.</TE>
<TE>   Even though all the board members may be in agreement, changes to
a common interest development made at the insistence or manipulation
of one board member without a consensus of all homeowners can be an
indication of ulterior motives. It can raise questions of whether a
board member may be ready to sell the unit and is looking for an
opportunity to enhance the sale by increasing its "curb appeal."</TE>
<TE>   Change for change's sake--especially when it requires an outlay of
homeowner funds (which is where the association gets its money)--not
only demands full analysis of all the ramifications before any change
is made but may also require a vote of the owners. Nothing in the
Davis-Stirling Act prevents you from demanding that such an analysis
be made or requiring approval by a majority of the homeowners.</TE>

<HD>Test Safety-Pressure Valve for Leaks or Corrosion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MORRIS CAREY and JAMES CAREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Our hot-water heater safety-pressure valve runs all the
time and drains all the water out of the tank. Why?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: All water heaters have a valve to control temperature and
pressure that is designed to keep the water heater from exploding.</LD>
<LD>   Some manufacturers suggest testing the valve every six months or
so by raising and lowering the test lever on the valve. This should
produce a sudden burst of hot water from the drain line connected to
the valve.</LD>
<TE>   More frequent testing can reduce the chance of a leak caused by
corrosion buildup. However, if a leak results immediately after a
test, simply operate the test lever several times to free lodged
debris that might be preventing the valve from seating properly.</TE>
<TE>   There are a few reasons your valve is running all the time. The
valve might be built up with corrosion. Try flipping the test lever
up and down a couple of times and tap the stem using a hammer to seat
the valve.</TE>
<TE>   If this doesn't do the trick, check to make sure that the
thermostat (located on the controller) hasn't been turned up. It
should be set on medium for the safest and most efficient operation.
Excessively hot water will cause the temperature-and-pressure-relief
valve to open. Test the temperature of the water by using a
thermometer in a glass filled with hot water from the tap. The
temperature should not exceed 130 degrees Fahrenheit.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, excessively high water pressure can cause the
temperature-and-pressure-relief valve to leak. Residential water
pressure should run between 30 psi and 55 psi. Pressure exceeding 55
psi can potentially damage clothes washers, dishwashers, icemakers
and other water-supplied appliances.</TE>
<TE>   Most homes have a water-pressure regulator valve at the location
where the water enters the building. You can test the water pressure
by using a gauge available from the hardware store. Screw the gauge
onto a hose bib and turn on the water. You can adjust the water
pressure by turning a nut or screw on the pressure regulator.</TE>

<HD>Fee Markups Allowed in Some States</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>KENNETH R. HARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A little-noticed move by federal financial regulators gives official
sanction to unequal treatment of home buyers and mortgage borrowers
on settlement fees, depending on where their home is located.</LD>
<LD>   Consumers in major metropolitan areas such as Chicago,
Indianapolis and Milwaukee now have fewer protections against
under-the-table "markups" of settlement fees than mortgage borrowers
elsewhere. Absent congressional action or a U.S. Supreme Court
decision to the contrary, they can be charged $55 for a credit report
that cost the lender $15. They can be charged $450 for an appraisal
that cost the lender just $275.</LD>
<LD>   Home buyers in other parts of the country, by contrast, cannot be
marked up behind their backs. That would be a violation of federal
law.</LD>
<TE>   How can that be? Aren't federal laws supposed to treat everyone
the same, no matter who they are or where they live? Yes, but the
system doesn't always work that way.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent policy memorandum to banking agency examiners
nationwide, the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, a unit of the
Treasury Department, said that in three states--Illinois, Indiana and
Wisconsin--examiners should no longer flag cases of home settlement
fee markups as violations of federal law. Examiners should now
essentially ignore them when they spot them on financial
institutions' books, rather than reporting them to federal
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   That's because federal consumer-protection law in those three
states effectively diverged from the rest of the country last year. A
decision by a federal appellate court now takes precedence over a
federal agency's longtime interpretation of the law, and will
continue to do so indefinitely, according to the new policy guidance
to bank examiners.</TE>
<TE>   In its decision in Echevarria vs. Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co., the
7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that overcharges on real
estate recordations by the title company were not violations of the
federal settlement procedures law administered by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development. Chicago Title was found to have marked
up recordation fees it paid to the county recorder's office on
borrowers' settlement sheets.</TE>
<TE>   Such markups are widespread--but go undetected--in home real
estate settlements in many parts of the country. They can occur in
virtually any settlement fee category, from appraisals to courier
fees. Though often relatively small on a case-by-case basis, mortgage
and settlement firms that close hundreds of loans per month can
pocket substantial profits from the markups. In one recent settlement
with HUD, a California lender was alleged to have made more than
$92,000 worth of markups on consumer credit reports alone.</TE>
<TE>   Under long-standing HUD policy, such markups are illegal
nationwide. But under the latest guidance to financial institution
examiners, they are now permissible in Illinois, Indiana and
Wisconsin. As long as no split or kickback of the overcharge occurs
with another party in the transaction--that is, the lender or title
company pockets the entire overcharge and shares it with no one
else--the markup conforms to the appellate court's standard.</TE>
<TE>   Underlying the settlement fee controversy is a legal dispute over
the consumer protections created by the federal Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act. That law expressly prohibits referral-fee
kickbacks among real estate brokers, lenders, title agencies and
others. It also prohibits collection of fees when no services or
goods are rendered to the consumer.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a decade, HUD has maintained that the law also
prohibits markups of settlement services, where a bank or title
agency provides no extra service to justify the added charge to the
buyer. HUD Secretary Mel Martinez reemphasized that legal position
late last year, warning lenders and others that they risk stiff fines
and prosecution when marking up charges on settlement sheets. That
prohibition includes situations such as Chicago Title's, where the
firm shared the markup with no one, according to Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   The title and escrow industries have challenged HUD's
interpretation of the statute, arguing that only when a markup is
split with another party does it violate the law. Those industries
also have challenged Martinez's interpretation of "unearned fees" in
general. The law bans kickbacks, they maintain, but it does not
empower HUD to regulate fees or review the prices that settlement
companies charge their customers.</TE>
<TE>   The appellate court in the Echevarria case accepted the title
industry's point of view. The new financial regulatory guidelines
from the Comptroller of the Currency essentially tell bank examiners
and auditors: Until this issue gets resolved, treat markups
differently depending on location. In Illinois, Indiana and
Wisconsin, follow the rule set by the appellate court. Everywhere
else, listen to HUD.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gary Oldman--who has played such characters on film as Dracula, Lee
Harvey Oswald and Ludwig van Beethoven--has sold his Hollywood Hills
home for about $2 million.</LD>
<LD>   The British actor is said to be renting in the Los Angeles area.
His wife, Donya Florentino, filed for divorce last year.</LD>
<LD>   The couple, married in February 1997, had owned the home for four
or five years. They spent three years refurbishing it. Built in 1930,
the three-story Mediterranean-style house has four bedrooms and 41/2
bathrooms in slightly more than 4,000 square feet.</LD>
<TE>   The house also has park-like grounds with a pool, a two-story
entry, a living room with a fireplace and beamed ceilings, a study
with a fireplace, a breakfast area, a family room and a hobby room.</TE>
<TE>   The asking price was just under $2.3 million. The buyer was
described as a businessman.</TE>
<TE>   Oldman, 43, was previously married to actress Uma Thurman.</TE>
<TE>   He co-starred in such movies as "Hannibal" (2001), "The Contender"
(2000), "Air Force One" (1997), The Scarlet Letter" (1995), "Immortal
Beloved" (1994), "Bram Stoker's Dracula" (1992), "JFK" (1991) and
"Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead" (1990). The movie "Sin,"
starring Oldman and Ving Rhames, is not yet scheduled for release.</TE>
<TE>   Brett Lawyer of Nourmand &amp; Associates, Beverly Hills, had the
listing, and Aileen Comora of Sotheby's, Beverly Hills, represented
the buyer, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Popeil, who has pitched such inventions on TV as the smokeless
ashtray and GLH (Great Looking Hair) spray-on compound designed to
hide baldness, has purchased a Beverly Hills-area home in the
$7-million range.</TE>
<TE>   Known as "king of the infomercial," Popeil, now in his mid-60s,
made a fortune in the 1960s promoting the Veg-O-Matic food chopper.
More recently, he has been promoting the Showtime Rotisserie &amp; BBQ
ovens.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife, Robin, 34, a former swimsuit model, were
attracted to the Beverly Hills-area home in part by its huge eat-in
kitchen. Popeil is most at home in his kitchen, where he likes to
work on improving his products. He has created many but not all of
the items that he has marketed.</TE>
<TE>   The contemporary-style villa also has eight bedrooms, a screening
room and a gym in slightly more than 14,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Sperling, son of the founder of the Arizona-based University
of Phoenix, and his wife, Stephanie, have purchased a home adjacent
to their 12-acre Montecito estate for $25 million in cash, local real
estate sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The purchase, less than a mile from the home Oprah Winfrey bought
last year for $54 million, is one of the largest for a private
residence in Montecito.</TE>
<TE>   The home that the Sperlings bought is on 10.5 acres. Built in 1916
and recently renovated, the Mission Revival-style home, designed by
Francis T. Underhill, is reached by way of a long, tree-lined drive,
which ends at a large motorcourt surrounded by stone walls and a set
of carved Moorish doors.</TE>
<TE>   The home also has a 60-foot entrance hall, a family-media room, a
full basement with wine and grocery cellars; a walk-in vault; a staff
suite; five upstairs bedrooms, including a master suite with an ocean
view; a guest house; a pool; and garage space for more than nine
cars.</TE>
<TE>   The Sperlings' adjacent home was purchased in 1997 from actress
Geena Davis and her ex-husband, director Renny Harlin, for about $9.5
million. That property has a 9,000-square-foot main residence, a
guest house, a staff cottage, a tennis court and a pool.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Sperling, 41, also purchased a three-acre oceanfront site in
Montecito for $17 million a year ago. The site has a guest house but
no main residence. The purchase included house plans.</TE>
<TE>   Sperling's father, John, created the University of Phoenix as a
for-profit school open only to jobholders age 23 and older. It won
accreditation in 1981 and by 1997, its enrollment topped that of New
York University.</TE>
<TE>   Paulo Benedeti, who stars as an award-winning Latino fashion
designer in the CBS daytime drama "The Bold and the Beautiful," has
become a first-time home buyer with his purchase of a Sherman Oaks
home for about $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   The house, on a knoll in the hills, has two bedrooms and a
convertible den in 1,600-plus square feet. Built in 1950 and situated
behind gates and walls, the house also has a detached
studio-gym-office and valley views.</TE>
<TE>   Before he joined the cast of "The Bold and the Beautiful" in May,
Benedeti, who is in his mid-20s, appeared on the New York-based CBS
soap "Guiding Light."</TE>
<TE>   Eric Lieberman of Prudential John Aaroe &amp; Associates, Studio City,
had the listing; Michael Fried of Coldwell Banker-Studio City
represented Benedeti.</TE>
<TE>   The West Los Angeles home of the late Maude Chasen, who helped run
the popular Beverly Hills restaurant Chasen's for half a century, has
been listed at $1.65 million.</TE>
<TE>   The three-bedroom, 2,700-square-foot condominium has views from
the Hollywood Hills to Catalina. The unit is in the Blair House, a
29-story high-rise built in 1989. The complex has a pool and a tennis
court.</TE>
<TE>   The unit, which has two large patios, also may be purchased
furnished.</TE>
<TE>   Chasen died in December at age 97. Her husband, vaudevillian-comic
Dave Chasen, died in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   He opened his restaurant, a gathering place for the entertainment
industry, in 1936. His wife took an active part in running it after
they were married in 1942.</TE>
<TE>   Chasen's, where Ronald Reagan proposed to Nancy and where Jimmy
Stewart held his bachelor party, closed in 1995. The restaurant then
licensed its name to another group, which opened a new Chasen's at a
different location.</TE>
<TE>   Sally Brant, estates director of Coldwell Banker in the Brentwood
East office, has the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Misiano, a director and producer on the series "ER"
and "The West Wing," has purchased a Los Feliz home that had been
listed at just under $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time that the house had come on the market since
it was built in 1921.</TE>
<TE>   The house has six bedrooms and 41/2 bathrooms in about 5,000
square feet. The home has views of downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Misiano, who lived in New York until he started directing and
producing "The West Wing" and "ER," was drawn to the Los Feliz house
by its comfortable feeling. It reminded him of a big Upper West Side
apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Misiano previously directed "Law &amp; Order," "Third Watch," "Now and
Again," "Nash Bridges" and "Brooklyn South."</TE>
<TE>   Susan Chadney, associate manager and estates director of
Prudential California Realty, a John Aaroe division in Hancock Park,
represented Misiano in his home purchase.</TE>

<LD>   As an optional approach, he suggests having the foundation
repaired and then proceeding to list the price at full market value.</LD>
<LD>   What if I pay for these repairs and the buyers' home inspector
deems the work to be inadequate?</LD>
<TE>   What recourse would I have?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Your Realtor has made some excellent suggestions. Start by
determining the actual extent of the problem and the cost of making
adequate repairs.</TE>
<TE>   This begins with an evaluation by a licensed structural engineer
who can diagnose the foundation problem and prescribe the needed
repairs.</TE>
<TE>   A licensed general contractor can then bid on the job of
implementing the engineer's recommendations. At that point you'll
know whether it's worth proceeding with repairs.</TE>
<TE>   If repairs seem viable, all work should be done with permits from
the local building department and approved by the municipal
inspector.</TE>
<TE>   In that event you'll have the engineer's report, the contractor's
warranty and the building department's approval to assure buyers. All
of this documentation should be included with your disclosure
statement.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, if you elect to sell the property without
making foundation repairs, the engineer's report and the contractor's
bid can be included with the disclosure statement, and the price can
be adjusted as your Realtor suggested to reflect the amount of the
bid.</TE>
<TE>   In that case you will have provided your buyers with accurate
information regarding the condition of the property.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of which course you pursue, the buyer's home inspector
will be preceded by a reliable engineering report.</TE>
<TE>   Driveway Is Not What</TE>
<TE>   It's Cracked Up to Be</TE>
<TE>   Q: Our concrete driveway was installed only 10 months ago, and
already there is a crack more than 10 feet long. The contractor has
suggested that we cut a quarter-inch-deep groove along the crack and
fill it with cement.</TE>
<TE>   This sounds like a hokey repair to us. We think the contractor
should replace the entire driveway.</TE>
<TE>   What do you suggest?</TE>
<TE>   A: It is not easy to evaluate a crack without actually seeing it.</TE>
<TE>   If the crack is a hairline only, 1/16 inch wide or less, that is
typical for concrete driveways. A wider crack would be unusual for a
relatively new installation.</TE>
<TE>   Most driveway cracks can be prevented by using proper procedures
before pouring the concrete. These include compaction of the soil,
placement of an aggregate base (rock and gravel), installation of
steel rebar or wire mesh as reinforcement, and expansion joints to
accommodate stresses, ground movement and shrinkage.</TE>
<TE>   If these steps were skipped, then cracking of the pavement was
predictable.</TE>
<TE>   Attempting to eliminate the crack by cutting and filling the
surface will not produce the kind of finished appearance you expect
when you pay for new pavement.</TE>
<TE>   If agreement on an acceptable solution seems out of reach, a
third-party expert should be consulted.</TE>
<TE>   If arbitration would be mutually acceptable, a qualified home
inspector or general contractor could be hired to serve in that
capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Putting the Chill on</TE>
<TE>   Recessed Ceiling Lights</TE>
<TE>   Q: Some of the recessed lights in my house have overheated, and
I'm worried about fire. When the bedrooms were repainted, I removed
the fixture covers and found that the hardware and surrounding
drywall were badly discolored.</TE>
<TE>   Two of these lights had 100-watt bulbs instead of the 60-watt
bulbs recommended on the manufacturer's label. How can I be sure that
heat buildup in these fixtures will not cause a fire in my home?</TE>
<TE>   A: Incandescent ceiling lights, when properly installed, are
reasonably safe if the bulb wattages are in accordance with the
manufacturer's specifications.</TE>
<TE>   Since these fixtures have been exposed to excessive heat, they may
have incurred damage and should be replaced to avoid problems.</TE>
<TE>   Another consideration is insulation. Even when the correct bulbs
are used, overheating can occur if insulation in the attic is
installed over recessed ceiling lights. The attic should be inspected
to ensure that there is unrestricted air space between the insulation
and the fixtures.</TE>
<TE>   To further minimize heat problems, you can change to fluorescent
bulbs. This will have the added benefit of reducing your electric
consumption, since far more power is needed to produce heat than to
make light.</TE>

<HD>A Victorian Victory</HD>
<DH>After years of neglect, an aging Pasadena eyesore is reborn
as a historic beauty by undergoing an extensive but inexpensive
overhaul.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY PRICE-ROBINSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First-time homeowner Greg Kohout has mixed emotions when he thinks
back on the eight-month remodel that turned his frightful Pasadena
eyesore into the pride of the neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   "It was exciting," Kohout said, and "it was horrible."</LD>
<LD>   The horrible part was the 1895 Victorian home's wretched condition
after years of neglect. The house wasn't habitable when Kohout and
his partner, Bob Curbelo, first saw it in May 2000, but people were
living there nonetheless--without electricity, water or a functioning
plumbing system. Fortunately for the neighbors, the dirty house with
its peeling paint was partially hidden by overgrown oleander hedges
20 feet high and 20 feet thick.</LD>
<TE>   The exciting parts of the remodel were looking for decorating
ideas, asking remodeling questions on Internet chat rooms and hiring
subcontractors to take the interior down to the bare studs and then
build it back up to a pristine condition. And most exhilarating of
all, said the homeowners, was the shopping.</TE>
<TE>   "We're great shoppers," said Kohout, who lists their best sources
as EBay (where they found, for instance, 100-year-old brackets from
Indiana), salvage yards (fireplace mantels), auctions (antique
furniture), Recycler classified ads (kitchen cabinets, columns),
thrift stores (book cases, bureaus), and at least one trash can
(hanging lamp).</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, prudent purchasing is how the two kept the cost of the
all-encompassing remodel down to $135,000. When added to the $170,000
purchase price, that equals an investment of $305,000 for a house
that was recently appraised at $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I love doing it," Curbelo said of remodeling. Added Kohout: "We
might do it again."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Kohout and Curbelo became homeowners only reluctantly after
they learned they would have to move from the 900-square-foot,
$1,000-a-month Silver Lake home they had rented for the previous
three years.</TE>
<TE>   "We were fine renting," said Kohout, an actor, who was touring in
Europe as the lead in "Grease" when Curbelo called him in March 2000
with the news: "We have to find a new place."</TE>
<TE>   At first, the two figured they'd just rent another small house,
but this time with a yard for their dog, Lola. They soon learned that
in the last few years, rents in Silver Lake had spiked dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   "Every place wanted at least two grand," Kohout said. "And with a
dog, they wanted $2,500. I was totally surprised."</TE>
<TE>   For those prices, they realized they could pay a mortgage. But the
two were frustrated when they found that home prices in Silver Lake
started at $400,000 for something "decent" (rather than the $250,000
price range they hoped for) and rose into a half-million and up for
something extraordinary.</TE>
<TE>   When Kohout returned from his tour, he and Curbelo started looking
for a house with real estate agent Tom Murray of Jim Dickson
Realtors. Curbelo, a physical therapist who travels to clients all
over the Los Angeles area, hoped Kohout would consider other areas,
including Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   As an actor, though, Kohout "didn't want to be that far from the
business." Finally, he agreed to look at houses in an old Pasadena
neighborhood that Curbelo said was "coming around."</TE>
<TE>   Murray first showed the pair houses that were already fixed up,
but not to their liking. Then just three days into the search, the
agent showed Kohout and Curbelo the battered Victorian, even though
it wasn't the Craftsman or Spanish style his clients requested, and
even though other clients had been horrified by it.</TE>
<TE>   Once Curbelo got past the oleanders, he took in the dirt yard,
ragged porch without rails and overall gloom of the place. He also
saw the original wood siding, second floor balcony, and bay windows
on either side of the house.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our house," he thought. Beside him, Kohout was thinking
the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, they saw beyond what turned out to be truckloads of trash
to the mostly intact original moldings and pocket doors that were
painted but otherwise fine. Most heartening was that in the
2,500-square-foot home's 105-year lifespan it had never been chopped
up into smaller apartments.</TE>
<TE>   The pair offered $170,000 against the $190,000 asking price, and
their offer was accepted.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Kohout and Curbelo followed the traditional remodeling
method of hiring a general contractor, who had been recommended by
friends. When problems arose, the homeowners decided to hire
subcontractors (framers, plasterers, plumbers, electricians, etc.)
themselves, as well as laborers. After that, Curbelo said, the
process changed from worrisome to "wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the remodel's success is because of the fact that one of
the homeowners was on the job site almost all the time. "It was more
important that we have a home than me going on another tour," Kohout
said.</TE>
<TE>   The job was enormous. All the interior walls and ceilings were
stripped down to the studs, which were made of redwood and had
virtually no termite damage.</TE>
<TE>   Before the walls and ceilings were closed back in, modern
electrical and plumbing systems were installed, plus high-speed
Internet capacity, sound system, vacuum system and alarms.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most important aesthetic improvement was replacing a
32-inch unremarkable front door with a wide, stately, dark-wood door
flanked with antique sidelights and topped with three leaded-glass
accent windows.</TE>
<TE>   To create a focal point for the living room, a fireplace was
installed and fronted by an antique mantel, which Curbelo stripped
and refinished. Indeed, Curbelo, an avid hobbyist, stripped and
refinished much of the furniture, doors and moldings in the home.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the living room, to the left, lie a library and a den. To
the right is the dining room and kitchen. When the owners bought the
house, the kitchen was little more than a few cabinets and a
peninsula tucked into the rear of the house. To create a larger
kitchen, the space from a large adjacent utility room was
incorporated. To create a formal dining room, a separating wall was
built between it and the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   For the kitchen, Kohout found nearly new maple cabinets with
crackled glass inserts through the Recycler. The original owner had
taken the cabinets out of a house that was going into foreclosure and
stored them for a year before advertising them for sale. Though he
said he paid $16,000 for them, he advertised them for $1,600, and
Kohout got the price down to $1,200.</TE>
<TE>   After he "puzzled it out," Kohout hired a carpenter to install
them. Dark green granite counters were installed for $2,200, and the
original wide-plank floors were refinished.</TE>
<TE>   Upstairs, the master bedroom got another fireplace and antique
mantel, and an adjacent bedroom's space was preempted to build a
luxury master bathroom with a large whirlpool tub and a slate-lined
shower that feels like a cave.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, new porches were built front and back, a picket fence
added, the house repainted and a new roof installed. The investment
also included a new two-car garage, oversized to make room for
furniture refinishing. Leftover cabinets from the kitchen give the
garage an elegant feeling.</TE>
<TE>   Months after the remodel was completed, the Victorian was included
in a tour of historic Pasadena homes and the homeowners were able to
tell many of the 550 visitors, "You can do this, too."</TE>
<TE>   The pleasure of living in the house has not abated. "We're happy
every morning we wake up," Kohout said, who added he often thinks,
"Who are we? Why do we have this house?</TE>
<TE>   "We're so lucky," he said.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I have been renting a condominium for nearly five years now
and despite my attention to all of the general maintenance items, I
feel that it's time for some upgrades, specifically the carpet and
paint. The painting is needed only in high-traffic areas, but the
carpet is 15 years old. Despite professional cleaning, it is faded
and frayed.</LD>
<LD>   I would also like to install a garage door opener, as the
homeowners association is enforcing a requirement that vehicles be
parked in the garage. I would be happy to do all the work necessary
to find the best deals. I just don't want my rent to go up as a
result of any improvements. Would it be reasonable to ask my landlord
to pay for any of this?</LD>
<LD>   Tenants' rights attorney Steven R. Kellman replies:</LD>
<TE>   You face a common problem shared by many tenants regarding repairs
or maintenance on non-habitability type conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Although the law does not require carpets, they must be replaced
when they become dangerous or unhealthful. Carpets generally have a
useful life of about 10 years. Carpets that are faded and tired do
not pose a habitability violation, but frayed material could since
there may be trip hazards.</TE>
<TE>   Paint usually needs at least some touching up after three years to
maintain a good appearance, but the law does not require the paint to
look good. Paint could become a habitability problem after several
years with peeling or mold and mildew problems.</TE>
<TE>   You may offer to share in the work to have these matters handled
before they reach the critical stage. For example, your landlord
could supply the paint and you could do the actual painting.</TE>
<TE>   As to the carpet, you could offer to pay the labor costs of moving
your furniture and possessions to minimize installation costs. The
addition of a garage door opener is truly a convenience item and is
supplied by some landlords only as an amenity. You could ask your
landlord to purchase the opener to enhance the property and offer to
pay to have it installed.</TE>
<TE>   Although you are not required to do so, making these offers may
achieve a real win-win landlord-tenant relationship. In this way, you
both invest in the property to create a nicer place to live along
with increasing the value of the property.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, keep in mind that your landlord may raise the rent (in
the absence of any rent control laws) without needing to first spend
some money on repairs to justify that raise.</TE>
<TE>   When Repairs Aren't Met and Deposit Is at Stake</TE>
<TE>   Q: I just moved into my apartment three months ago. We are already
having problems as the front window leaks when it rains. Also, the
heater has not been fixed, we have bugs, and several minor cosmetic
repairs were promised but never completed.</TE>
<TE>   I have never signed a written rental agreement, but verbally we
agreed to a month-to-month tenancy. When I put down my deposit, the
landlord just wrote, "must stay six months to get deposit back" on
the back of the receipt.</TE>
<TE>   I have called and reported these problems, but nothing ever gets
done. Can I move? If so, do I get my full security deposit back? If I
stay, doesn't the landlord have to address all of my complaints?</TE>
<TE>   Property manager Robert Griswold replies:</TE>
<TE>   Verbal agreements of less than one year are enforceable yet not
advisable for tenants or landlords. Since you are on a month-to-month
agreement, you can move after giving your landlord a 30-day notice of
your intention to vacate the premises. This time be sure to put it in
writing.</TE>
<TE>   California law is very clear regarding security deposits. I
believe that the statement that you "must stay six months to get back
deposit" is illegal if it is intended to make any portion of your
security deposit nonrefundable.</TE>
<TE>   All security deposits must be fully refundable. Sometimes you will
see creative landlords call the security deposit by another name. For
example, a cleaning deposit, pet deposit, performance guarantee fee
or re-leasing fee.</TE>
<TE>   But the California Civil Code is very clear that regardless of
what the deposit is called, or to be used for, it must be fully
refundable and any deductions are only for the legally allowed items
contained in Section 1950.5. You should receive a full accounting of
your security deposit, including a refund of any balance due to you,
within 21 days of your vacating the premises.</TE>
<TE>   If you stay, your landlord must address all health and safety
issues. The leaking windows and broken heater would seem to qualify
as health and safety or habitability violations. The issue of the
bugs requires a determination as to the cause, and the responsibility
will vary. For example, if the landlord can establish that the bugs
are the result of your poor housekeeping, then the landlord would
clearly not be responsible.</TE>
<TE>   The other cosmetic repairs should be completed since they were
promised; however, it will be more difficult to enforce this,
particularly since you do not have anything in writing.</TE>

<HD>Gentlemen, Time to Start Cheating</HD>
<DH>Daytona 500: With a new season comes rules changes and many
race teams are willing to bend, or break, NASCAR regulations to gain
an advantage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE SPENCER</AU>
<BD>THE SPORTING NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Skinner, sidelined since the fall Dover race because of a series
of crashes, is eager to get back in the car.</LD>
<LD>   Skinner, 44, is a racer. A former Craftsman Truck champ, he
doesn't just make laps.</LD>
<LD>   But despite his success on the truck circuit, it has been five
years, or 167 races, since Skinner graduated to Winston Cup, and he
hasn't won once. It's not that he's desperate, but there's definitely
a sense of urgency. He is determined to prove to himself--and the
naysayers--he's capable of doing the job.</LD>
<TE>   After offseason testing, Skinner is excited about the prospects of
his new ride for 2002, Morgan-McClure's No. 4 Chevrolet. And the
drive to win at all costs still burns inside.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the [crew] to do whatever they want to the car as long as
we win," Skinner said before arriving at Daytona.</TE>
<TE>   Including bending a few NASCAR rules?</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," he said. "And I told the guys if we get busted, I'll pay
the fine."</TE>
<TE>   To Skinner, the benefits of a win far outweigh the punishments
that accompany cheating, and he should know. Skinner was the last
NASCAR driver to lose his first-place winnings after a postrace
inspection (at the 1999 Busch race at Atlanta)--but the victory
stood.</TE>
<TE>   Therein lies the reason Skinner's team and many others are willing
to push the limits in the gray and not-so-gray areas of the NASCAR
rule book.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the garage say cheating will occur more frequently this
season and continue until the punishment fits the crime, such as
NASCAR taking away a win--or the 175 points that come with it.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the only way NASCAR will get anyone's attention," says
crew chief Tony Furr, who was suspended for four races for cheating
last season. "Taking away the crew chief, yeah, that hurts the team
and it hurts the sponsors, which they don't need to do. And fines?
People will pay the fines. Money's not the problem or the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "What NASCAR needs to do to really get their attention is take
away the win. Now that hurts the whole team--not just the sponsor,
not just the crew chief, not just the owner as far as his pocketbook.
That would hurt the whole team and make them think twice before they
ever do it again."</TE>
<TE>   Teams dramatically increase the performance on their cars by
affecting two areas: the body and the engine. Before qualifying at
Daytona last week, quite a few teams were sent to the back of the
line after their cars' bodies failed the initial inspection--the cars
did not fit into the NASCAR template, particularly the rear deck
lids.</TE>
<TE>   As for the engines, the distribution of restrictor plates is
supposed to be random, but some in the garage believe plates with
slightly bigger holes end up on preferred cars.</TE>
<TE>   One driver, who didn't want his name used for fear of
repercussions, says that sometimes a team will distract the NASCAR
official and takes matters into its own hands if it isn't one of the
chosen few.</TE>
<TE>   "With a little sandpaper, you can shave the holes on the
restrictor-plate openings and take tenths (of a second) off your
laps," the driver says. A tenth of a second can add up, especially
over a 500-mile race. Like Skinner, this driver believes it's worth
the gamble if it means winning the race.</TE>
<TE>   "That's ... a game that we've played, even back when I was
racing," Winston Cup Series director John Darby says of cheating in
general. "If you can bring 10 things wrong with your car to the
racetrack with the hopes that the inspectors will only find half of
them, then it's like cheating on your taxes. If you cheat on your
taxes for five years and only get caught one year, then you're four
years ahead."</TE>
<TE>   That's the philosophy the teams have--some just play the game a
little better than others. Furr had an ongoing game of cat-and-mouse
with previous Cup director Gary Nelson dating to 1997, when John
Andretti won the Pepsi 400 at Daytona in Cale Yarborough's No. 96
Ford. Nelson was certain the car, prepared by Furr, was illegal, but
Nelson couldn't find the violations. Last year, Nelson did catch Furr
-- for the failure of Jerry Nadeau's car to meet minimum roof height
specifications during qualifying for the Daytona 500 -- and the team
was slammed with a $10,000 fine and Furr's four-race suspension.</TE>
<TE>   Furr says cheating is "not the mentality at Hendrick Motorsports
at all," and he learned a lesson.</TE>
<TE>   But what's a little bad publicity when you look at the return? It
used to be drivers tried to win races because they were competitive
-- and certainly, the desire to win still is foremost in their minds.
But today, NASCAR is big business, and though the teams provide the
product, the sponsors and television drive the sport.</TE>
<TE>   More is on the line by cheating than just a win, and that's why
this season, with prize money at a new high, teams are willing to
cheat like never before. The Joyce Julius Sponsors Report shows a
sponsor's exposure on TV during a race can be worth millions. When
Joe Nemechek won the Pop Secret 400 at Rockingham last year, for
instance, his sponsor, Oakwood Homes, was mentioned four times and
received 31 minutes of screen time, worth an estimated $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Those numbers paled in comparison to the face time Dale Earnhardt
Jr. and Budweiser received in winning the 2001 EA Sports 500 at
Talladega. Granted, the Talladega race was a No Bull 5 bonus event
and Junior was running for $1 million, but Budweiser was on TV
screens for more than one-third of the broadcast, worth an estimated
$11.6 million in exposure--the highest such total of the season.
Chevrolet, Junior's manufacturer, was second only to EA Sports that
day, getting more than $5 million worth of exposure.</TE>
<TE>   Later that afternoon, NASCAR slapped Junior's crew chief, Tony
Eury, with a $25,000 fine when the No. 8 car failed to meet the
minimum height requirement in the postrace inspection. But it was a
small price to pay when you consider what the sponsor made and the
$1.1 million won by the team.</TE>
<TE>   The responsibility to run fast at a track such as Daytona lies
mainly with the crew chief, who must find every advantage he can on
the car--and that means pushing the limits. But it's desperation,
either from a lack of funding--with an eye on all those dollars
mentioned above--or performance that drives teams over the edge.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't cross the line like other teams may, but we'll certainly
walk all over it and push and pull at it for different reasons," says
Jeremy Mayfield, driver of the No. 19 Dodge.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everyone's out here wanting the same thing. It's just
some will go a little farther to make that happen."</TE>
<TE>   To make sure cheating doesn't become prosperous, NASCAR recently
enlisted four engineers to bring its inspectors up to speed on the
technological advancements on the cars. With all the Winston Cup
teams having at least one engineer on the payroll, NASCAR was playing
catch-up. But to gain respect throughout the garage, NASCAR must
eliminate any suspicion that teams are not treated equally during
inspection.</TE>
<TE>   Darby says he is working toward making the inspections more
consistent, which would go a long way toward eliminating a sense of
impropriety.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the teams will learn that early on and then take some of
the, 'Well, this guy got away with this' mumbo jumbo out of the
garage area,'" he says.</TE>

<HD>Robinson Ready for History</HD>

<BD>THE BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>When Mike Skinner slowed momentarily to change ignition boxes and
inadvertently set off an eight-car accident just 11 laps into
Thursday's second Twin 125-mile qualifying race for Sunday's Daytona
500, Shawna Robinson readied herself for disappointment.</LD>
<LD>   Robinson needed a good finish, a top-15 finish in the race, to
guarantee herself a starting position in Sunday's race. At that
moment, her chances were slim.</LD>
<LD>   But, before the sun set Thursday evening, Robinson learned she had
made the field and will start 36th. Her BAM Racing Dodge, which had
run 182.663 mph during qualifying last weekend, was the last car to
make the field on qualifying time.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm racing in the Daytona 500," she said smiling widely. "Is that
cool or what!</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big relief, but we've got to make the car better."</TE>
<TE>   On the 25th anniversary of driver Janet Guthrie becoming the first
and, until Thursday, only woman to qualify for the race, Robinson
became the second.</TE>
<TE>   Now, another of Guthrie's achievements is on the line. In her
first race here in 1977, she finished 12th and was the
highest-finishing rookie. In 1980, in her only other 500, she was
11th.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson is one of just three rookies to make the race, joining
pole-sitter Jimmie Johnson and 23rd-place qualifier Ryan Newman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dave Marcis, who turns 61 next month, has made the 500 for the
33rd time in his career; not only made it, but barreled his way into
it. He finished seventh in his Twin-qualifying race and will start
14th.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether this might change his mind about retiring, Marcis
grinned and said, "I didn't want to retire in the first place."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dale Earnhardt Inc. will host a "Silent Candlelight Tribute" to
seven-time Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt on Sunday from 7 p.m.
to midnight at the company headquarters in Mooresville, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 18 will mark the one-year-anniversary of Earnhardt's death at
Daytona.</TE>
<TE>   More than 350,000 visitors came to DEI to pay their respects over
the past year. According to DEI's CEO and Earnhardt's widow, Teresa,
the tribute is a way of offering the fans an opportunity to remember
and honor the man who touched their lives.</TE>
<TE>   She is also asking fans who cannot attend to light a candle in
their homes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Security at Daytona International Speedway is up, as it has been
at every big event since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   For fans, one of the changes is in the restriction on big coolers.
Clear plastic bags are now the order of the day.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to limit the potential of someone taking a dangerous
or deadly weapon into the speedway," Daytona Beach police chief Ken
Small said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former NFL quarterback Terry Bradshaw, seen more often now on
television promoting a discount long-distance phone company than at
sporting events, was here Thursday for two announcements.</TE>
<TE>   He and his motor sports partner, Armando Fitz have signed Kerry
Earnhardt as their Busch Grand National driver for the season.</TE>

<DH>Salt Lake Games: Iran's 22-year-old skier has gone from
tending sheep to participating in Winter Olympics despite his
nation's troubles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM BOOTH</AU>
<BD>THE WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>It's the kind of Olympic moment that might make viewers misty-eyed.
The young shepherd boy with a dream, who learns to ski on the
mountains of his troubled homeland, and who against all odds, arrives
at the Winter Games to carry his nation's flag into the Opening
Ceremonies with tears running down his cheeks.</LD>
<LD>   Except that slalom skier Bagher Kalhor is from the Islamic
Republic of Iran, and his country's been condemned by President Bush
as part of an "axis of evil," an enemy state sponsoring international
terror.</LD>
<LD>   Iraq and North Korea, the other "axis" states, didn't send
competitors to the Olympics, but Iran did, its first for a Winter
Games in the United States. So far, the two athletes and their
coaches have been greeted not as pariahs, but with the kind of warmth
and curiosity previously reserved for cuddlesome underdogs like the
Jamaican bobsled team.</LD>
<TE>   "I can say that our reception has been the warmest possible.
Everyone is curious to see what we are like and they see we are not
terrorists but people of peace," Eisa Saveh Shemshaki, president of
the Iranian Ski Federation, said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   While the popular image of Iran these days includes the masses
screaming "Death to America," as they did this week in a Tehran rally
marking Iran's revolutionary anniversary, Iran's Olympic team exudes
more party than Party of God. It speaks the international laid-back
dude-speak, even translated from Farsi.</TE>
<TE>   The handsome Kalhor, 22, dressed in black jeans and black sweater,
said, "They ask some political questions, and I talk about the skiing
and just say peace." He smiled sleepily.</TE>
<TE>   Asked his impression of America, Kalhor gave a thumbs up and said
in English, "Excellent."</TE>
<TE>   When he's not skiing the slalom, Kalhor said he hoped to take in
the Salt Lake City and Park City sites and do some shopping. He has a
fiancee back home, and he really did grow up tending his family's
flock of sheep. His twin brother, Sadegh, was also an accomplished
skier, perhaps even more talented than Bagher, but he lost his lower
leg in a skiing accident five years ago; Sadegh will compete in the
Paralympics here this month.</TE>
<TE>   The delegation had only one official requirement, that the federal
government waive its usual practice of fingerprinting and
photographing all Iranians visiting the United States, a procedure
the Iranian government considers insulting. The Bush administration
waived the requirement.</TE>
<TE>   The entourage said they moved through immigration and customs in
Chicago with ease. "They just swept us through," said Morteza Saveh
Shemshaki, the cross-country ski coach. "No problem. Welcome to
America. Have a nice day."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the only person who seemed not entirely pleased by their
arrival was President Bush, who was shown on television sitting
stone-faced when the Iranians entered the Opening Ceremonies, though
the crowd gave them a big round of applause.</TE>
<TE>   The small delegation, decked out in blue and white parkas with
"IRAN" emblazoned on the back, don't come across as indoctrinated
tools of Iranian propaganda. Far from emoting hostility, the coaches
remind their visitor: "Do not forget, there are six incredible ski
areas just outside of Tehran. Next time you come to Iran, bring your
skis."</TE>
<TE>   The young athletes roll their eyes when asked about the political
ramifications of their visit here, but their coaches are happy to
deal more directly with the question.</TE>
<TE>   They say that Bush is wrong, that Iran isn't evil and doesn't
condone terrorism, that its government is democratically elected, and
that Iran wants to be appreciated as a member of the world community,
not a rogue state.</TE>
<TE>   The athletes and coaches, though semi-officials of the Iranian
government, say they're not here as apparatchiks, but from extended
athletic dynasties, representing several interrelated families who
hail from two mountain towns, Dizin and Shamshak, where downhill
sports are centered in Iran.</TE>
<TE>   "People are always surprised to learn we have big, snowy
mountains," said head coach Majid Seghatoleslami, who divides his
time between Tehran and Park City, Utah. "But we have gorgeous
mountains."</TE>
<TE>   Shamshak was developed by European engineers. Locals watched the
foreigners skiing, and slapped boards on their feet and used saplings
as poles and picked up the sport. During the 1970s, Iranians became
relatively accomplished on the slopes, and the ousted Shah and his
family often skied.</TE>
<TE>   But religious revolution in 1979, the hostage-taking at the
American embassy in Tehran and the war with Iraq that followed
derailed winter sports in Iran. "There wasn't the fuel to run the
lifts or to drive your cars to the mountains," said Seghatoleslami.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether religious authorities frown on skiing, or consider
it decadent or too Western, the head coach said no. "Every Friday in
Iran, the slopes are crowded with skiers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Mostafa Seyed Mirhashemi skied in his one and only
event, the men's cross-country pursuit, a two-race event. His
starting position in the 10-kilometer classical portion was dead
last. His overall finish: 79th of 85 competitors, not good enough to
move on to the 10k freestyle portion.</TE>
<TE>   But his teammates were impressed to see that in the land of the
Great Satan, the crowd rang cow bells and hooted and some even
shouted, "Go Iran!"</TE>

<HD>NBC Walks Into a Ratings Winner</HD>
<DH>Analysis: Television network has scored big with the
skating controversy and its presentation of Games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FOLKENFLIK</AU>
<BD>THE BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC couldn't have cooked up a better ratings-grabber if it had
brought in Jeff Gillooly to arrange yet another whack-a-mole with an
Olympic figure skater.</LD>
<LD>   There's been some transcendent camera work this week, particularly
with the downhill skiing and speed skating, along with dramatic
competition, and lovely vistas on all three of the network's
channels, which include CNBC and MSNBC on cable.</LD>
<LD>   But the network has clearly recognized that the murky stew of
sport, pageant and commerce has been transformed into a glorious
bouillabaisse with a single ingredient: scandal on ice.</LD>
<TE>   Ratings for the first six days of the Winter Olympics on NBC
proper were nearly 20 percent above those registered by CBS during
the Nagano games four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   More than 150 million Americans have tuned in since the opening
ceremonies. In key demographics--those advertiser-friendly folks
between the ages of 18 and 49, for instance--ratings rose even more.</TE>
<TE>   At the outset of the prime-time broadcast, chief NBC Olympics host
Bob Costas kept viewers' attention with what he called "Skate Gate:
the ongoing controversy."</TE>
<TE>   Costas offered an exclusive interview with International Skating
Union President Ottavio Cinquanta. The Italian sports bureaucrat was
responding to allegations that pressure and vote-swapping among
judges were involved in the awarding of a gold medal to a Russian
figure skating duo over a Canadian pair that had skated a seemingly
flawless routine.</TE>
<TE>   Gently, Costas asked the questions on everyone's mind. "This
matters a great deal, commercially, image-wise," he said. "Are you
concerned about the question of integrity of this sport, overall?"</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta languidly recited almost identical answers to those he's
delivered the day before at a press conference, forcing Costas to ask
if there were any more details that could be disclosed about his
association's inquiry. (The answer: No.) One half expected Cinquanta
to say, in his elegantly diffident way, "Who are you going to
believe--me or your own eyes?"</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday night, NBC slapped a "breaking news" logo at the
bottom of the screen. Not since Nancy Kerrigan's plaintive cry eight
years ago--"Why me?"-- had there brewed such a made-for-TV
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   The coverage of the games has veered from the cutting edge
(snowboarding) to the arcane (curling) to the traditional (figure
skating). The music and tone of the profiles have changed
accordingly. Overexuberant patriotism has been kept appropriately in
check, while computer-enhanced graphics have been illustrative
without being intrusive.</TE>
<TE>   The likable Scott Hamilton became overheated at times, yelping his
thoughts during the figure skating competition too loudly to be
easily understood.</TE>
<TE>   Others, such as skiing commentators Todd Brooker and Christin
Cooper, better blended appreciation and observation, thereby arriving
at strong insights.</TE>
<TE>   NBC has no need to worry about such distinctions, however. It's
already won its gold.</TE>

<HD>Scott Has the Nets Flying High</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Former Laker's knowledge of the game has
impressed many and helped team rise to the top of the Eastern
Conference.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN DEVENEY</AU>
<BD>THE SPORTING NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Back when he hired Byron Scott to coach the wretched Nets in June
2000, team President Rod Thorn spoke of Scott as a guy who could
cover "every possible conceivable situation that could happen on the
basketball court."</LD>
<LD>   Sure, Scott had an excellent basketball pedigree, having won three
championships with the Lakers. Sure, he counted Pat Riley and Larry
Brown, for whom Scott played, among his coaching mentors, as well as
Rick Adelman in Sacramento, where Scott served two seasons as an
assistant. Scott also had youth and energy going for him, making him
a good candidate to emulate the recent success of
players-turned-coaches such as Scott Skiles, Larry Bird and Doc
Rivers.</LD>
<LD>   But the one thing that most blew away Nets management was Scott's
knowledge of the game. Thorn described a five-hour session in Chicago
in which he sat with Scott and a magnetic board, watching Scott push
10 magnets through a series of game situations. Half court offense
and fast breaks. Defenses, double-teams, rotations. End-of-game
possibilities, down by one, up by three, 30 seconds left, 20 seconds,
10 seconds. Scott had it all covered. A week later, he was coach of
the Nets.</LD>
<TE>   Knowing Xs and Os helps little, though, if you have no Xs or Os
with which to work. That was Scott's curse in his first season as
Nets coach. The Nets finished 26-56. Scott describes last season,
when injuries ravaged the Nets, as "frustrating." Star point guard
Stephon Marbury missed 15 games, forward Keith Van Horn missed 32
games and guard Kerry Kittles missed the entire season. A leg injury
forced center Jayson Williams to retire. At times, Scott lashed out
at his players, including No. 1 overall draft pick Kenyon Martin.</TE>
<TE>   Fast forward a year, and the Nets are on top of the Eastern
Conference at the All-Star break. Credit for the Nets' turnaround has
been heaped on new point guard Jason Kidd, and it is deserved. Kidd
has been sensational and has earned MVP consideration. Credit also
has been given to Thorn, the man who brought Kidd to the Nets and
took successful gambles on free-agent center Todd MacCulloch and
rookie swingman Richard Jefferson. Thorn deserves Executive of the
Year consideration. Credit also belongs to salubrity.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey has been able, for the first time in recent memory, to
keep its team in good health.</TE>
<TE>   But don't discount the contributions of Scott, who coached the
East team in last week's All-Star Game, to the wondrous turnaround.
The team was 32-15 at the break, its best record at the break in its
25-year NBA history. As good as the Nets have been, this team defies
the conventions of the modern NBA. There is no great scorer. There is
no 1-2 punch.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets have Kidd, not much of a shooter himself, and a handful
of slightly above-average players such as Martin, Van Horn and
Kittles. Journeymen Aaron Williams and Lucious Harris are the top
reserves, and rookies Jefferson, Jason Collins and Brian Scalabrine
also are contributing. The team is playing better than the sum of its
parts, a sure sign of good coaching.</TE>
<TE>   Scott has stressed defense and toughness, something he
demonstrated personally in November in an overtime win over the Jazz.
During the second quarter, Scott was on the floor attempting to calm
Martin and was pushed by Jazz forward Karl Malone. Scott had to be
restrained from going after Malone, and got into a shouting match,
telling Malone he had "no heart."</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Scott added, "Malone don't scare me like nobody
else in this league.... I don't back down from anybody. As a player,
I didn't, and I'm not going to do it as a coach. I'll meet him after
the game if he wants." Scott, mind you, is 6-foot-4, 200. Malone is
6-9, 256.</TE>
<TE>   Scott's lessons in toughness have paid off. Rebounding and defense
have been the cornerstones of the Nets' success, an odd turn for a
team that traditionally ranks among the league's worst in both
categories. New Jersey entered the break allowing 92 points a game,
fourth in the league. Opponents were shooting 42.2 percent, which
ranks third. The Nets were grab 44.3 rebounds a game, sixth overall.
Most of all, Scott finally has the right players to showcase the
reason the Nets originally hired him: his skill with Xs and Os.</TE>
<TE>   For six years, as his playing career wound down and while
assisting Adelman in Sacramento, Scott jotted down in notebooks
things he learned about the game. But during the utter flop that was
his first year, Scott was not able to utilize any of what he had
learned. It was difficult enough just trying to figure out who was
available to play each night.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Scott has tailored a terrific offensive scheme around his
personnel, allowing his team to maximize the presence of Kidd's
precision passing. The Nets run full-throttle when fast-break
opportunities are available. When they go to half court sets, the
notebooks come in handy. Scott relies heavily on the motion offense
and backdoor cuts he learned from former Princeton Coach Pete Carril,
who was part of the Kings' staff during Scott's coaching
apprenticeship. No team outside of Sacramento shares the ball as well
as the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   It has taken a while for New Jersey to come together
offensively--the Nets were shooting 43.3 percent in the first two
months of the season. But since Jan. 1, the Nets have shot a couple
of percentage points better, a sign that the offense is improving.</TE>
<TE>   It still can be slowed with a good defensive plan. That's what
Dallas had last week. The Mavericks sent two or three defenders back
on each possession to guard the break, used a zone to stop Kidd's
penetration and forced New Jersey to settle for outside shots,
holding the Nets without a field goal for the last 4:25.</TE>
<TE>   But don't worry. Surely, it all went down in Scott's notebook.</TE>

<HD>Johnson Can Always Remember the Medal</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>SHAUN POWELL</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>About three dozen people mingled quietly in the room. They were three
dozen faces familiar to him in another lifetime, but now mostly
foreign.</LD>
<LD>   Every so often someone would approach Bill Johnson trying to
rekindle his happiness, and maybe the memory he lost in the terrible
accident, too.</LD>
<LD>   Some were more successful than others.</LD>
<TE>   "There's Jimmy over there," Johnson said to one man.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it was Johnny.</TE>
<TE>   "I know you!" he said to another.</TE>
<TE>   The man's name escaped Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Another handshake and hug came moments later. Johnson studied the
face carefully and broke out the biggest smile of the night.</TE>
<TE>   "That cowboy hat," Johnson said. "I'd know it anywhere. Good to
see you, Billy."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it was his friend Billy Kidd, Olympic silver medal winner in
the 1964 slalom. Kidd and Johnson sat together on the sofa, two
former Olympic skiers talking about the old days, their families and,
of course, the men's downhill race that took place a few days
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "Why did three Austrians beat the nearest American?" Johnson
asked.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "Because I fell," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Kidd replied softly, touching Johnson's shoulder. "You
did."</TE>
<TE>   The tumble did more than cost Johnson a remote chance to make
another Olympic team. It nearly cost him his life.</TE>
<TE>   It happened last March 22, on a slippery slope in Montana, where a
40-year-old trapped in a serious mid-life crisis tried to be a
world-class skier again.</TE>
<TE>   Back in 1984 he came from nowhere to become the first American to
win gold in the downhill, the mother of all ski races.</TE>
<TE>   He looked at all of the competitors who gathered on Mount
Bjelasnica in Sarajevo that day, sneered at the mighty Austrians and
made a boast that would later prove prophetic.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why everyone else is here," Johnson said. "They
should go ahead and hand the medal to me."</TE>
<TE>   He felt just as confident in the months leading up to the Salt
Lake Games.</TE>
<TE>   He knew he would make the U.S. team and stun the world. He soared
down the mountain trying to reach a qualifying time. Then his skis
caught an edge. His feet spread far apart. He flipped. He fell face
first. His unconscious body kept drifting. He was airlifted off the
slopes.</TE>
<TE>   "I was there the next day," Kidd said. "All of us knew it wasn't
just a fall where you break a leg. We knew it was far more serious
than that."</TE>
<TE>   Months of hospitalization and therapy followed. Johnson, who was
in a coma for three weeks, suffered severe neurological damage and
massive internal bleeding.</TE>
<TE>   Surgeons removed a quarter-inch of his brain, froze it, then
replaced it. There's still a knuckle-sized dimple in his skull, which
Johnson invites anyone to touch.</TE>
<TE>   "They took my head apart and put me back together," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Not quite.</TE>
<TE>   The same sport that brought him fame has rendered him helpless in
certain areas. A portion of Johnson may never return.</TE>
<TE>   He walks and talks slowly. He's back under the care of his mother,
D.B. Johnson. And an entire decade was wiped from his memory bank.</TE>
<TE>   Anything that happened in the 1990s escapes him. He didn't know
his father died six years ago. He can't recall the birth of his two
boys, or their names, or their T-ball games.</TE>
<TE>   As she watched his attempts at conversation the other night, D.B.
Johnson often interrupted and gently filled in the gaps for her son.</TE>
<TE>   "He says a lot of things that just aren't right and things we
haven't heard of," she said with a sigh. "We have no idea where it's
coming from, either. That's the hardest part."</TE>
<TE>   He serves as an extreme reminder of the risks skiers take each
time they test themselves against the mountain.</TE>
<TE>   In their quest to find satisfaction in the form of a fancy
medallion, they push themselves to the limits of speed and safety.</TE>
<TE>   Almost every Olympic skier can smash records, but only the truly
brave ever try. They're a lot like NASCAR drivers. At some point
along runs that can reach 90 miles per hour, the element of danger
taps them on the shoulder and tells them to ease up, or else.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the Bode Millers of the sport must decide: Is this
really worth a medal? In Johnson's case, he wasn't trying to reclaim
Olympic glory, just the lifestyle he once knew.</TE>
<TE>   He went through a bitter divorce with a woman he loved. She took
the boys and moved, denying him the chance to watch them grow. The
family breakup devastated him. He knew only one way to replace the
absence in his life.</TE>
<TE>   "For him, skiing again was a healing thing," his mother said. "It
was something he knew and something he loved doing. Considering what
he was going through, he needed to be active. He was training hard
and trying to get in shape."</TE>
<TE>   It was a radical decision by a skier who hadn't competed in years,
and who was well beyond his prime. But he felt a berth on the 2002
team would impress his former wife.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost her and tried to get her back," Johnson said, "although I
don't know why. I can't remember too much about our time together."</TE>
<TE>   On his last night in Salt Lake City before returning home to
Gresham, Ore., Thursday, Johnson was honored by a roomful of former
Olympians. The purpose of the fund-raiser was to reduce his medical
bills, and their presence was to increase his awareness.</TE>
<TE>   As the evening progressed, so did Johnson. The names and the faces
became easier to match.</TE>
<TE>   He does remember how to ski and just as important, why he skis.</TE>
<TE>   He keeps a small black case tucked inside his jacket. He reached
for it, opened it and revealed the 1984 gold medal. He does this
almost daily. It's almost a reflex now.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone here at the Olympics is trying to get something I
already have," he smiled as he dangled the medal. "I won this a while
ago. I remember how. It was a good day."</TE>

<HD>Enjoying the High Life in Italy's Alps</HD>
<DH>Skiing, hiking, feasting and cozying up in chalet-dotted
towns in two regions of the Dolomites, where the strong dollar can
make a snow vacation cheaper than a trip to the Rockies.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CORVARA, Italy</DL>
<LD>My two daughters watched in horror from the balcony of our hotel in
the Italian Alps as I hurtled down a "black diamond" slope, an
expert-level ski run far too steep for my ability. Skis, poles, legs
flailed in all directions, sending up a cloud of snow that enveloped
me in what looked like a Daffy Duck cartoon brawl.</LD>
<LD>   A mogul (bump) slowed my acceleration, and while sliding on my
side I managed to maneuver the skis' edges at right angles to the
hill and stop. Knowing my slick red snowsuit would act like a Slip
'n' Slide, propelling me down the hill again, I braced my skis
against the snow and dared not move.</LD>
<LD>   To Marisa, 19, and Talia, 13, I was a small red speck a quarter of
a mile up a slope that would end at the back door of the Hotel Posta
Zirm in the Tirolean mountain village of Corvara, where we were
staying. The girls thought the worst when I came to a stop, and they
felt helpless to rescue me.</LD>
<TE>   My husband, Rolf, and I didn't mean to take the expert slope on
our last run of the day. But a thick fog at the top of the mountain
shrouded the directional signs, and we made a right instead of a
left. Suddenly it was steep beyond reason. I traversed the hill to
keep my speed in check, but after a full day of skiing, my leg
muscles had turned to jelly, and that's when I began the long fall.</TE>
<TE>   Now, sitting upright in the snow, I felt calmed by the silence. No
more clickety-clack of out-of-control skis, no more scraping sounds
over ice patches. The dramatic, jagged limestone cliffs of the
Dolomites surrounded me, and for a moment I put aside thoughts of my
predicament to enjoy the scenery--especially Mt. Marmolada just
across the valley, jutting sharply into the sky at 10,968 feet, the
highest peak in the Dolomites.</TE>
<TE>   I gave Rolf the thumbs-up when he called to me from farther down
the hill. Like many Europeans, he learned to ski as soon as he could
walk and adeptly handles any steep slope.</TE>
<TE>   "Just slide down on your back," he yelled.</TE>
<TE>   Perfect solution. I took off my skis and set them and the poles
across my stomach, then lifted my feet and let gravity carry me home.
Snow filled my sleeves and jacket, and chunks of ice pelted my face.
But it hardly mattered. I was like a kid on a sled, and it became my
favorite "run" of the whole week.</TE>
<TE>   The Dolomite Alps in northeast Italy are a popular ski destination
for Europeans--about 60% are Italian visitors, the rest Austrians,
Germans, Dutch and British. Americans number only 1%, according to
the Italian Government Tourist Board. Indeed, a woman in the sauna at
the hotel asked why we came all this way just to ski. Why not ski
closer to home, say, in Colorado?</TE>
<TE>   Two reasons: It was a family reunion with in-laws meeting us there
from Germany. And it's cheaper to ski in Italy than it is in the big,
expensive resorts of Vail or Aspen, even with air fare added in. Last
March, our lift tickets were $18 per day; private one-hour ski
lessons were only $25. And a massage to ease sore muscles after a day
of schussing: $32 for one hour.</TE>
<TE>   Most costs, including hotel packages, are about half of those in
the U.S., especially this year with the strong dollar. Air fares to
Milan this winter (checked for a mid-March week) are $454 round trip;
they're $370 to Denver. Not much of a spread.</TE>
<TE>   And think about it: You are in the Alps, where Olympic skiing
stars are born, where even the food at snack stands at the top of the
lifts is some of the best, where church bells ring in deep valleys
and echo against craggy 10,000-foot mountain peaks.</TE>
<TE>   We arrived the second week in March, past prime season. Still,
there was plenty of snow, and it was in good condition. Like most
Alpine ski resorts, Corvara is not near an international airport.
Venice, a two-hour drive, is the closest major city, but we flew into
Milan (four hours from the resort) so we could supplement the
vacation with visits to Venice, Verona and Milan on the drive back.</TE>
<TE>   The Hotel Posta Zirm, where we stayed, was chosen by my in-laws,
who book the same third-floor suite every year. The staff speaks some
English, the location is ideal (with balconies that overlook the
slopes), and a chairlift is just steps from the back door. The room
price comes with daily breakfast and an epicurean dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Breakfast at Posta Zirm is buffet style, with seeded rolls, a
variety of cold meats and cheeses, yogurt with muesli, boiled eggs
and fruit. Dinner is a dress-up affair that starts at 7 p.m. and ends
months later--or so it seemed. The five courses arrived
slowly--Europeans don't rush through dinner--and each course was a
work of art set on plates decorated with flower petals and drizzled
with multicolored sauces.</TE>
<TE>   I worried about the area's wildlife population. Anything that
hops, trots, flies or scampers through the forest is on your plate by
evening. We had venison, quail, rabbit, mountain goat and snails. As
beautifully prepared and delicious as the meals were, my daughters
were disappointed that a trip to Italy didn't mean pizza and
spaghetti each night. The meals were more Austrian- and
northern-Italian-influenced than they expected.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel is one of the nicest in town, with large, bright rooms,
pretty views and big bathrooms with hair dryers and plenty of large
towels. The fireplace in the lobby was always crackling, and comfy
chairs next to it were hard to resist. But Rolf and I peeked into
several less expensive hotels in town, all of which looked cozy and
inviting, each with a restaurant serving local cuisine.</TE>
<TE>   We skied every day but one. Talia had tried skiing a only couple
of times in California, so we found an English-speaking teacher for
daily private lessons, which greatly enhanced her confidence and
enjoyment on the slopes. Marisa wanted to go snowboarding, which
isn't nearly as popular in Europe as it is in the States, though it
is slowly catching on with the younger set. Over our weeklong stay,
she probably saw only 15 other snowboarders.</TE>
<TE>   The terrain is hillier than on U.S. slopes, which meant there were
places with uphill spots where she had to remove her snowboard and
walk up for a few minutes to get to the next downhill trail. (Skiers
with poles can point their skis into a V and "skate" uphill so that
an ascent doesn't interrupt a good run.)</TE>
<TE>   Also, there are far more platter lifts--nearly extinct on American
slopes--where an attendant hands you a rope with a round plate
attached to it. You put it between your legs, lean back on the plate
and let it pull you up the hill. It's easy for skiers, but
snowboarders must stand on one foot, so it's a real balancing act. On
the other hand, the chairlifts are modern and fast.</TE>
<TE>   In the Dolomites, skiing is a means of transportation as much as a
sport. Five villages in the Alta Badia region (Corvara, Colfosco, La
Villa, San Cassiano and Pedraces) are connected by a series of lifts
and runs. Skiers can park the car in one town and in one afternoon
pass through multiple villages covering several miles.</TE>
<TE>   Alta Badia has 57 lifts that link 75 miles of ski runs, and a
transport capacity of 65,000 people per hour. Thankfully, hotel
occupancy in March was only 50%, so it wasn't crowded.</TE>
<TE>   Ski runs are usually expansive, but occasionally they become
narrow and cross roadways or sidle up so closely to them that, with
one uncontrolled turn, you could end up as a hood ornament on
somebody's car--a safety issue that would put a smile on any U.S.
personal-injury lawyer's face. But Europeans don't put up fences on
ski slopes, and even the youngest skiers navigate the narrow trails
with ease.</TE>
<TE>   From 1915 to 1917 Alta Badia was at World War I's front lines, and
at some hilly points you can ski past bunker and shelter ruins with
historical markers. Though the disputed land between Austria and
Italy was certainly worth fighting for, Italians gained the land
(courtesy of an alliance with the French and the English), but not
necessarily the culture. German is spoken as frequently as Italian,
the half-timbered architecture with flower boxes looks Austrian, and
the cuisine is a delicious melting pot of both cultures.</TE>
<TE>   We gave ourselves a day to rest sore muscles in the middle of the
week and drove one hour east to Cortina d'Ampezzo, the larger, hipper
resort town. The 1956 Winter Olympics were held here, which put it on
the map for tourists. Whereas Corvara has few shops--mostly offering
ski gear and sweaters--Cortina is a paradise for shoppers, albeit
ones with deep pockets. Shops selling woodcarvings, pottery, shoes
and clothing are everywhere. But skiwear here is unique and stunning;
the fabric glistens with gold, bronze, greens and yellows. At $500
and up for an outfit, the designs make you look svelte, athletic--no
Pillsbury Doughboy look. I figured Big Bear's Snow Valley couldn't
handle my wearing such chic styles, so, although I had fun trying
them on, I only bought a pair of $15 goggles.</TE>
<TE>   We walked the streets and found a pizza-by-the-slice stand. After
so many fancy meals, the simple cheese pizza tasted exquisite.</TE>
<TE>   On the slopes we tried a new mountaintop restaurant every day. We
would call our relatives on a cell phone (it seemed everyone was
talking on cell phones, on the lifts or even while skiing) and meet
about 1 p.m. There were no bad restaurants. Most served hearty
goulash or potato soups, sausages with rye bread, pastas with cream
sauces, apple strudel and tiramisu, beer and wine; about $4 to $8.
Then we would ski it all off before dinner.</TE>
<TE>   As it does on any vacation, the end of the week came too fast. My
father-in-law lamented the fact that every year they arrive on a
Saturday and it isn't until Thursday that his skiing skills are back
to their best. To which Rolf replied, "Then why don't you arrive on a
Thursday?"</TE>
<TE>   After a week of watching everyone ski so proficiently, I finally
deduced why there are no bad skiers here. Skiing poorly is
detrimental to one's self-esteem. In the U.S., beginner runs are
dubbed "bunny slopes"; in the Alps they are called Idiotenhugel, or
"idiot hills."</TE>
<TE>   My skiing improved throughout the week, but next time I plan to
take daily lessons and perhaps get past my fear of steep slopes--just
in case a fog ever envelops the signs to the idiot hills again.</TE>

<TE>   10 days at the Milan airport and carried chains ($10 extra), which
we never needed. Buses service the ski region from Milan's central
rail station for $80 round trip (0342-905-090). Take a bus to
Bolzano, from where you catch a local bus to small towns throughout
the Dolomites; about $35 round trip.</TE>
<TE>   Where to stay: Corvara's high season, Feb. 2 to March 8, is short,
so it's easy to get a less expensive room in low season and still
have plenty of snow. All hotels offer room with "half
pension"--breakfast and dinner.</TE>
<TE>   The Hotel Posta Zirm, 0471-836-175, charges $90 per person, per
night in low season and $105 in high season. This includes an
enormous buffet breakfast and five-course gourmet dinners.</TE>
<TE>   We also liked the cozy rooms at Pensione La Fontana, 0471-836-</TE>
<TE>   000, www.lafontana.com, just a block away. For a room with daily
breakfast and a more casual dinner, the cost is $40 per person, per
night in low season and $70 during high season.</TE>
<TE>   The elegant Parkhotel Planac, 0471-836-210, www.planac.com,
outside town, charges $160 per person, per night. In high season that
price doubles. A ski lift is outside the door.</TE>
<TE>   Where to eat: You need to ski to most mountaintop restaurants.
Nonskiers will find cafes open daily in all the hotels. One
restaurant reachable by everyone is the Speck Stube (no phone, no
address), next to the Colfosco gondola. It exudes Old World charm
with wood tables, cuckoo clocks, Tirolean oompah music and beer
steins on the wall. We had good pasta dishes, Wienerschnitzel
(breaded pork cutlet) and bowls of beef goulash. Entrees run $3 to
$7.</TE>
<TE>   Where to get tickets and equipment: The Corvara office of Dolomiti
Superski, 0471-836-366, www.dolomitisuperski.com,</TE>
<TE>   charges $117 for a six-day lift ticket, good on all 460 lifts and
gondolas throughout the Alta Badia region. Ski equipment (boots,
poles, and skis or snowboard) costs $80 per person for seven days. We
rented from Perfect Ski &amp; Snowboard, 90 Via Col Alt, Corvara;
0471-836-848.</TE>

<HD>Travel Agents Cry Foul Over Internet Fare Deals</HD>
<DH>Airline tickets may be far cheaper if bought online, but an
agency coalition says that's unfair to those without Web access.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Remember when airlines began "Internet-only" fares several years ago?
They typically gave 5% or 10% off for booking online, plus deeper
discounts on a few last-minute fares.</LD>
<LD>   Some people, including frequent fliers who should know better,
think that's still the case.</LD>
<LD>   They're wrong.</LD>
<TE>   Internet fares are now offered for tickets bought well in advance
and at prices that may be far cheaper than what the airline quotes on
the phone or what is offered on a computer reservation system (CRS in
trade lingo) that travel agents use to issue tickets. That's great if
you have a computer, a credit card and time to comparison shop but
not so great if you don't own those things or prefer the convenience
of using a travel agent.</TE>
<TE>   The disparity in fares lately has some travel agents hopping mad
and has me wondering this: Are Internet fares fair to consumers?</TE>
<TE>   In an organized campaign, more than 20 mostly smaller travel
agencies since December have bombarded the U.S. Department of
Transportation with documents that they say show hundreds of dollars
in differences between Internet and CRS fares. They want the DOT to
correct what they see as unequal access.</TE>
<TE>   In a typical filing, Catherine Mann of Chaparral Travel in Tucson
attaches printouts of CRS tickets and Internet searches that show,
for instance, a $2,533 CRS fare for a Washington, D.C.-LAX round trip
via New York versus $540 for the same flights and dates on Orbitz,
the Internet travel site owned by five major airlines.</TE>
<TE>   "My customers are being discriminated against because they do not
have Internet access, do not use credit cards, prefer dealing with a
human being or are unsure of how to wade through the hundreds of
sites that promise 'the lowest fare available,'" she writes in her
Jan. 23 filing. "These people, often elderly and on fixed income, are
being punished by having to pay higher airline fares." (Airlines
generally do not provide Internet-only fares to computer reservation
systems but do provide them to Orbitz, a sore point for travel
agents.)</TE>
<TE>   In early February, I tried my hand at the admittedly inexact
science of cyberspace comparisons earlier this month. With the help
of The Times' in-house travel agents and their CRS, I randomly
compared three fares for March travel, at least 21 days in advance
and including, in all but one case, a Saturday night stay. Each was
checked first on the CRS, then on the Orbitz Web site and then by
telephoning the airline for a fare quote, all within a half-an-hour.</TE>
<TE>   I found substantial differences in prices--20% or more. For a New
York-London round trip on United Airlines, for example, the Times
agent's CRS quoted $430.10 as the lowest available fare, the airline
reservations agent quoted $431.03 and Orbitz showed $341 for the same
flights and dates. For an LAX-New York (JFK) round trip on Delta Air
Lines, the CRS and airline quoted $335; Orbitz showed $255.</TE>
<TE>   The only fare on which all three sources agreed was a
Chicago-Washington, D.C., round trip on American Airlines (with no
Saturday stayover), at $233--the only one of the three itineraries
that didn't have an Internet-only fare posted by the airline.</TE>
<TE>   The airlines are reluctant to comment on fare disparities, citing
competitive and other issues. At United, spokesman Chris Brathwaite,
while acknowledging that "different portals have different pricing,"
says, "We just don't talk about our pricing or fares and how we deal
with that." Delta spokeswoman Peggy Estes said that "all of our fares
are the same price more than 99% of the time whether purchased from a
Delta reservation agent, a travel agent or on www.delta.com."</TE>
<TE>   Airline fares and inventory change quickly, making exact
comparisons difficult. The fares change thousands of times daily,
industry observers say, under the so-called yield management system
that adjusts prices to demand. For instance, a fare seen on the
Internet may not appear on a CRS checked minutes later because the
last seat at that price has been sold in the interim, not because the
fare was never available on the CRS.</TE>
<TE>   All of this poses a mighty challenge to consumers shopping for the
lowest fare--and I haven't even mentioned independent online travel
sellers who may negotiate their own special fares with airlines or,
like www.priceline.com, auction off fares. Airline expert Terry
Trippler, president of Trippler &amp; Associates Inc. in Minneapolis,
speaks for many exasperated consumers when he says, "[Airlines]
should just say: 'This is the price.'"</TE>
<TE>   And Mann of Chaparral Travel has a point when she says it is the
elderly and less wealthy who are put at the greatest disadvantage by
a system that posts the lowest fares on the Internet. On average,
non-Internet users are poorer, less educated and more apt to be age
50 or older than are Internet users, according to a report released
earlier this month by the U.S. Commerce Department. About 46% of
Americans still aren't online, the report found.</TE>
<TE>   Lawton Roberts, president of Uniglobe Country Place Travel Inc. in
Lawrenceville, Ga., and founder of a coalition called Travel Agents
of America (www.travelagentsofamerica.com), which is pressing the DOT
on the issue, views travel agents as victims too. The widening gap
between Internet and CRS fares is a bid by airlines to drive agents
out of business, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "They couldn't strangle us to death by reducing commissions, so
they're going to starve us to death by withholding the lowest fares,"
he contends, referring to cuts and caps on commissions that airlines
began imposing in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a travel agent can book an Internet-only fare for you,
and "we tell agents to do that," says Paul Ruden, senior vice
president for legal and industry affairs for the American Society of
Travel Agents (ASTA). Delta has a Web site,
www.delta.com/travelagent, that makes such fares available to agents.</TE>
<TE>   But travel agents may balk at doing so for a variety of reasons,
not the least of which is that they generally get no commissions from
the major airlines for booking Internet-only fares. They may also be
indirectly penalized by some CRS contracts that require them to book
a minimum number of flights on the CRS--or face penalties of hundreds
or even thousands of dollars, Roberts says. The more Internet-only
flights booked, the fewer CRS flights are booked. Record keeping and
itinerary changes are also more difficult with Web fares, Ruden says.</TE>
<TE>   Most travel agents will get something for booking you an Internet
fare, though. In a survey last year, ASTA reported that 88% of its
members were charging service fees, averaging $13.21 per ticket.
(Some have raised fees since then, after the airlines further cut
commissions last summer.)</TE>
<TE>   So when shopping for a low air fare, it pays to check the Internet
or ask your travel agent to check it for you. From your agent, you
may get the fare, an earful--or both.</TE>

<HD>Enjoying the High Life in Italy's Alps</HD>
<DH>Skiing, hiking, feasting and cozying up to chalet-studded
towns in two regions of the Dolomites, where a snow vacation can be
cheaper than a trip to the Rockies.</DH>

<AU>JOHN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BOLZANO, Italy</DL>
<LD>After two months in Italy, I thought I was beginning to know my
adopted country, but suddenly I felt lost and disoriented. Wasn't
that Wienerschnitzel I had just eaten for dinner? And why was I
admiring Tirolean architecture and gingerbread houses instead of
ancient temples and columns? And reading signs that said Willkommen,
Verboten and Ausgang?</LD>
<LD>   I was in Italy, all right, but this was Italy with a different
accent. Call it Austria Lite.</LD>
<LD>   Alto Adige (AHL-toe AH-dee-jay) is the home of the spectacular
Dolomite mountain range in the eastern section of the northern
Italian Alps. It's 185 miles northeast of Milan but just 25 miles
from the Austrian border, and that dual personality is part of its
delight.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly everything in Alto Adige, or South Tirol (Sudtirol), is in
German and Italian: menus, street signs, people. Yet the beauty of
the craggy, snowcapped Dolomites, stretching 100 miles across the top
of Italy like 10,000-foot steak knives, is almost beyond words in
either language.</TE>
<TE>   Few Americans visit this region, but after reading about the town
of Bolzano, which an Italian financial newspaper listed as No. 1 in a
quality-of-life survey last year, I knew I had to go. The Swiss and
Austrian Alps get more buzz, but Alto Adige boasts a similar array of
alpine recreations, such as skiing (which typically lasts until
mid-April), hiking and climbing. And there's more: Its breathtaking
scenery and Germanic efficiency, coupled with dirt-cheap Italian
prices and hospitality, make a winning combination.</TE>
<TE>   I arrived last month in Bolzano, the capital of the Alto Adige
region and doorway to the Dolomites, after a six-hour train ride from
Rome. On this 35-degree evening I wandered down narrow cobblestone
streets, heard German music pouring out of raucous bars and watched
the moonlight reflect off the snowy mountains. No matter the month,
the Dolomites still shine. What is German for bellissimo?</TE>
<TE>   When I arrived at my hotel, a gregarious employee, who apparently
didn't think I looked Italian, greeted me in rapid-fire German. He
then settled into a rough northern Italian dialect I don't usually
hear in Rome. Then again, I don't meet many Italians named Walter
Feichter.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out that the man owns and manages the Hotel Feichter,
which looks like a Swiss chalet and is hidden on a little cobblestone
street and up a flight of stairs. I first checked into a room in a
wing of the building, but it was too chilly, even for a cold-weather
lover like me. So I moved to the main part of the hotel, where my
cozy room had a warm down comforter, a phone and a TV, although the
view of the mountains was the best entertainment. The location was
terrific, the staff pleasant and the price--about $45, including a
buffet breakfast--fit my budget.</TE>
<TE>   It's little wonder this place is bicultural. A market town when
settled in the Middle Ages, Bolzano (Bozen in German) became the
region's jewel, bouncing from Bavarian rule to Austrian and belonging
to Napoleon's kingdom in his conquest of Italy. It was part of
Austria's Tirol province until Italy took control in 1918.</TE>
<TE>   During Benito Mussolini's efforts to Italianize the region in the
'20s, he added an Italian name to every German one. Even so, I often
forgot which country I was in.</TE>
<TE>   To this day, German and Italian are compulsory in school, and 4%
of the region's 450,000 people speak a third language, called Ladin,
a Romance dialect dating to 15 BC.</TE>
<TE>   Alto Adige clearly slants toward the Austrian side of the border.
The influence is visible in its architecture, its language and its
night life. Most of the buildings are in Tirolean style, with
handsome dark wood and small windows designed to guard against the
cold. On nearly every corner is a Gothic tower. The buildings are
done in oranges, greens, aquas, even pinks.</TE>
<TE>   On Piazza Walther (Waltherplatz), the heartbeat of this town lined
with tony cafes and restaurants, I substituted some deutscher Kaffee
(German coffee) for my daily cappuccino.</TE>
<TE>   I asked every person I met here what his or her native language
was. People are raised speaking German or Italian and learn the other
in school, but they tend to gravitate to their own.</TE>
<TE>   "There are German bars, and there are Italian bars," one
German-speaking soldier told me. Bus drivers greeted me in Italian.
Pizza vendors spoke German. Waitresses asked in Italian if I wanted
German or Italian menus. Kids holding snowboards waiting for ski
buses yelled in German.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Rome, where cafes are the center of socializing and public
drunkenness is the ultimate faux pas, Bolzano is crawling with bars,
and I saw people way over the limit. Also unlike Rome, nearly
everyone drinks beer, primarily German. I didn't see a single Peroni
or Moretti, Italy's two national beers, the entire week I was here.</TE>
<TE>   A charming restaurant called Hopfen &amp; Co. featured German beer ads
along the walls leading to the upstairs dining room, where a
fireplace extended a warm welcome. I had a bicultural meal: a
terrific pork dish called stinco di maiale alla griglia (grilled pork
shanks), delectable sauerkraut, roasted potatoes, two glasses of
Chianti and apple strudel, all for $18.</TE>
<TE>   Later, in a young person's hangout called Bar Scheune, I asked
bartender Christian Zanalla which country people identified with.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not Italy," said Zanalla, who grew up in Bolzano. "We are
not Germany. We are Sudtirol."</TE>
<TE>   Bolzano's cobblestone paths lead to a plethora of high-end pottery
and glass shops, books on feng shui, jewelry stores and expensive
knickknacks for people who don't need anything. But the panoramic
view of the mountains is free of commercialism and stunning in its
simplicity.</TE>
<TE>   I went to the tourist office to ask what part of this huge range I
should visit and where best to photograph the Dolomites.</TE>
<TE>   "Walk outside," the tourist agent said.</TE>
<TE>   I thought he was being sarcastic. He wasn't, and, indeed, in the
light of day, he was correct: The mountains were visible from any
angle nearly anywhere here. When I told him I wanted a closer look,
he pulled out a relief map the size of a tablecloth. I settled on Val
Gardena. The next morning I caught an 8 o'clock bus that went east
from Bolzano and north toward the Austrian border before turning east
again. This must be one of the best bus rides in Europe, I thought.
The half-dozen or so passengers and I relaxed in the comfortable,
Greyhound-size vehicle as it followed the half-frozen Isarco River
through a deep, narrow canyon. The sun had just started to brighten
the Dolomites' snowcapped peaks. Waterfalls looked like ice
sculptures. Halfway up the mountain, a medieval castle overlooked the
river.</TE>
<TE>   All too soon we pulled into the tiny town of Santa Cristina, where
I jumped on a gondola that shot through the middle of a bowl flanked
by mountains as menacing as giant pitchforks. I was in altitudinal
heaven.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways the Dolomites are more intimidating than the
Himalayas. Although not as tall, every peak stands alone, and you can
trace each from its tree-lined base, up its sheer face of golden rock
to its snowy top, making this one of the world's top rock climbing
areas. One false step, though, and it's an unobstructed fall down
thousands of feet.</TE>
<TE>   The uniqueness of the Dolomites comes from their origins as coral
reefs. Millions of years ago, tropical forest and a shallow sea
covered this area. The receding of the water, combined with the
formation of the Alps, raised this seabed to extraordinary heights.
Marine fossils are still found in the pinnacles.</TE>
<TE>   It also formed a natural ski area. As I rode up in the gondola
with a foursome from Bologna, I asked about the skiing. "Difficile,"
replied one of them. At least the reply wasn't "Impossibile."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Val Gardena is one of the more popular ski areas in Alto
Adige. It can be packed in high season, although snow has so far been
scarce this winter, the lowest in 40 years, and the few runs
operating during my January trip were using artificial snow. More
than a million people a year, primarily Italians and Germans, ski
here.</TE>
<TE>   Alto Adige has 28 ski areas, including numerous sites northwest of
Bolzano with easy access to Parco Nazionale dello Stelvio and the
spectacular Ortles range. Expert schussers can try "ski safaris" to
outback areas where the snow is untouched and the skiers are few.
Best of all, accommodations are inexpensive. Four-star hotels go for
as little as $100, and bed-and-breakfasts minutes from the ski slopes
may go for $40. Lift tickets run about $27 a day.</TE>
<TE>   Skiing isn't the only activity. Even in January, hiking was
terrific. At Val Gardena I left the gondola and walked up a slight
incline that started curling around the mountain. Every turn brought
a new angle to a gorgeous panorama of the peaks.</TE>
<TE>   In between were the pretty pastures of Alpe di Siusi, one of the
highest plains in the Alps. You'll find a bench about every 200 feet
along the trail, and I sat on each of them. It wasn't much of a
workout, but I never missed a view. I stopped for a bite at a ski
lodge halfway up a run. Even an Italian bun with cellophane-wrapped
cheese tasted good in this setting.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting for my bus later that day in Santa Cristina, I stopped in
a woodcarving shop. This area is known for figurines of clowns,
angels and religious figures made from maple and pine. It's also
known for the preservation of the Ladin culture. Helmut Karbon, 37, a
Ladin-speaking woodcarver, has lived in the valley all his life and
doesn't plan to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "This area is very special," said Karbon, who also guides ski
safaris in the winter. "You have many possibilities to do so many
things. You can walk in the mountains, hike, ski. The Rocky Mountains
take so long to see. You can see so much here in such a little time."</TE>
<TE>   True. The next day, making connections on buses running with
Germanic precision, I took off for the far southeast corner of Alto
Adige. Here the mountain bowls were double the size of those I had
seen the day before. The canyon narrowed as the peaks on both sides
grew bigger. We paralleled a river, and each turn produced a new
mountain fortress peeking through an opening in the range.</TE>
<TE>   The 3 1/2-hour bus ride, a bargain at $28 round trip, finally
ended at Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy's famed ski resort for the rich and
famous, which is covered with pricey chalets and trendy restaurants.
But the view was free.</TE>
<TE>   By the time I left Alto Adige, I had learned the German word for
bellissimo. It's wunderschon, but beauty is the same in any language.</TE>

<HD>All-Inclusive Deals With the Lure of the Tropics</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When economic times get tough, Americans tend to book vacations at
all-inclusive resorts to a far greater extent than they otherwise
would. They are the antidote to financial worries: You pay for
everything--air fare, room, meals, drinks, sports and
entertainment--in advance. Thereafter, the entire vacation is free of
money concerns.</LD>
<LD>   An increasing number of hotel resorts, particularly in the
Caribbean, Mexico and Central America, switch to an all-inclusive
policy, then face strong competition from other such resorts. Prices
fall, and bargains emerge--especially just after Easter, when demand
for tropical vacations falls.</LD>
<LD>   Here are five weeklong vacations costing as little as $735 per
person, based on double occupancy, for departures in May, June and
July:</LD>
<TE>   * Costa Rica: For $970 per person, double occupancy, you'll
receive round-trip tickets on American Airlines to Central America's
most popular and prosperous nation, including seven nights at the
Barcelo Tambor, on a fine-sand beach on the Nicoya Peninsula. The
package is sold by a reliable specialist, Capricorn Leisure, (800)
426-6544, www.capricorn.net, and includes not only meals but
unlimited alcoholic drinks--even outside mealtimes, which many
packages don't include. The $970 price is for West Coast departures
in May and June. July travel is $95 more; singles pay $229 extra.</TE>
<TE>   * Negril, Jamaica: On this culturally rich island hard hit by
travel jitters, seven nights--with air fare, meals and all
else--through June 15 at the cozy Negril Gardens, in a welcoming
small town, is going for $869 from Miami or Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
(You'll need to track down a budget fare to the departure point.)
That's from Web-only dealer Escape to Eden, www.escapetoeden.com, and
it even includes Jamaica's $25 departure tax.</TE>
<TE>   * Punta Cana, Dominican Republic: The under-visited Dominican
Republic remains a top source of all-inclusive deals. Spend seven
nights in the resort enclave of Punta Cana, near the country's
eastern end, in a modest two-floor bungalow of a hotel called the RIU
Melao, which supplies all meals and drinks. If purchased from
Vacation Express, (800) 309-4717, www.vacationexpress.com, which has
the money-saving advantage of chartering its own planes, prices are
just $759 from Atlanta or a bit more from one of the packager's 10
other Southeastern gateways. You will need to get to the departure
airport on your own.</TE>
<TE>   * Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico: At the four-star Grand &amp; Club Marival
the pace is more relaxed than at the resorts of crowded Puerto
Vallarta, 20 miles south. On a huge Mediterranean-style property
along the sweeping Bay of Banderas, vacationers have free access to
four pools, four restaurants and seven bars. All-inclusive
seven-night vacations are $735 from Los Angeles. Get this deal from
Baja Motion Tours, (800) 511-4848, www.mexicotravelnet.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Cancun: The Miramar Mision, a beachfront, 300-room low-rise in
the heart of Cancun's popular hotel zone, drops its prices to budget
levels for late spring and summer. Seven nights (with air fare,
lodging and unlimited use of its four restaurants and a seventh-floor
hot tub that boasts a panoramic view) start at $765 from L.A. That's
in May and June from the reliable Vacation Travel Mart, (800)
288-1435, www.vacmart.com. The tour company predicts that prices will
dip even lower in the weeks before summer begins.</TE>

<HD>Ski Bikes Are Great on the Slopes, but Forget the Wheelies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Snowboarders and skiers lately are being joined on the slopes by ski
bikers, who ride a strange-looking version of a bike on a ski and
wear a short ski on each foot. The sport is an increasingly popular
option for baby boomers with ski-battered knees and for cutting-edge
youths looking for new ways to conquer the mountain.</LD>
<LD>   At least 34 U.S. ski resorts welcome ski bikers, says Rod
Ratzlaff, director of the American Ski-Bike Assn.,</LD>
<LD>   www.ski-bike.org. Ratzlaff, who lives outside Lake George, Colo.,
founded the nonprofit group last year to promote the sport. "It's a
lot easier on your body" than downhill skiing, he says. In fact,
"creaky knees and leg endurance that isn't quite what it used to be"
helped drive him to the sport after 30 years of skiing, he says.</LD>
<TE>   Using techniques similar to downhill skiers', ski bikers carve
turns in the snow to control their descent; there are no brakes, so
they must turn to stop. Ski bikers have been clocked at up to 114
mph, Ratzlaff says. But most recreational bikers go 25 to 30 mph,
slightly slower than the typical skier, says Nicky Deford,
spokeswoman for Vail Mountain in Colorado. She recommends the sport
for strong intermediate skiers.</TE>
<TE>   Vail offers five nighttime guided tours that are "incredibly
popular," Deford says. Priced at $55 per person for 2 to 21/2 hours
of biking, they are always sold out, she says; reservations two to
three days in advance are advised.</TE>
<TE>   Some resorts, such as Vail, ban bikers in the daytime, but Bear
Mountain, Northstar at Tahoe and Sierra at Tahoe are among the
California resorts that welcome ski bikers. Ratzlaff says rentals
typically are $15 to $45 per day and that the bikes cost $600 to
$1,600 each. His Web site lists welcoming resorts, with links to
their Web sites and to ski bike manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   The sport, developed in Europe, was briefly popular in the U.S. in
the 1960s and '70s, then faded until its recent revival, Ratzlaff
adds.</TE>

<LD>The annual Trooping the Colour ceremony for the British queen's

<HD>Kids' 'Paradise' in San Diego</HD>
<DH>For a city-weary family, this resort isn't quite Tahiti,
but its tropical aura still refreshes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IRIS SCHNEIDER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>When you have two parents and two kids sorely in need of a vacation,
you think of an island paradise: Tahiti, Fiji and Bali come to mind.</LD>
<LD>   But seven hours or more on an airplane seemed a little long for a
weekend getaway. My husband, Paul, suggested San Diego, and with time
running out, I reluctantly agreed. We logged onto the Internet and
found a deal at the Paradise Point Resort and Spa: $129 per night,
plus tax. Someone had told us it has a tropical theme, with
palapa-style architecture, so I thought if I closed my eyes maybe I
could pretend it was Tahiti.</LD>
<LD>   We packed the minivan and headed out on a January weekend.
Paradise Point, which we learned later was called Vacation Village
when Hollywood producer Jack Skirball built it in 1962, is on
Vacation Road on Vacation Island. When it comes to vacations, these
people really point you in the right direction.</LD>
<TE>   The resort, bought by the Noble House group and renovated during
the last couple of years, is full of palm trees and poppies, ponds
and streams, with ducks swimming and waddling all over the place.</TE>
<TE>   The public spaces did indeed boast a somewhat antiseptic palapa
motif. The lobby, with high ceilings and fireplaces blazing day and
night, was devoid of people. Which may explain why, at the front
desk, we easily were able to upgrade to a one-bedroom suite, slightly
larger than the standard room and equipped with a kitchenette, for an
additional $30 per night.</TE>
<TE>   Just before we signed for the room, the clerk told me that each
room also had a nightly $8 "temporary energy surcharge." After
questioning him, I still wasn't sure what the charge was for or why
he called it temporary--since the energy crisis seems largely over. I
asked if we could exercise an option not to pay it if we promised to
use candles and conserve. (We couldn't.) Maybe it's just me, but I
always thought electricity came with the price of the room.</TE>
<TE>   The units at the sprawling 44-acre resort are one-story,
California beach-style bungalows, most near a stream or pond, roomy
and cheerful inside and landscaped for maximum privacy. Our room was
large and included a comfy sitting area and a huge walk-in
closet/dressing room big enough to double as a playroom for Janna, 6,
and Amanda, 9. We had two queen-size beds and sliding glass doors
that opened onto a little patio and a babbling brook.</TE>
<TE>   As we opened the curtains to look at the view, a beautiful blue
heron alighted on the grass outside. The bird flew off before I could
get my camera out, but I was impressed. These vacation islanders have
their act together.</TE>
<TE>   I later discovered that the heron lives on the property, along
with myriad other birds. A three-minute walk beyond our stream was a
beach on Mission Bay with lots of shells and even some sea glass for
the kids to collect.</TE>
<TE>   On our first morning at the resort, we tried to make the kids
breakfast--cereal, fruit and yogurt we had brought along--but the
kitchen wasn't equipped with utensils. On the other hand, I noticed
earlier that the closets had real hangers, not the annoying
anti-theft variety. How classy, I thought. They trust their
customers.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently they trust them with hangers, but not with silverware,
plates, pots or pans. About 20 minutes after we phoned the front
desk, housekeeping brought us silverware but no plates. "Oh, you want
plates too?" the housekeeper asked. Eventually we did get plates, but
never any pots or pans. I guess on Vacation Island, you are not to do
dishes.</TE>
<TE>   Next time I will save my money on the kitchen and ask for a free
toaster or microwave, which the bellman said we could request from
the front desk. (The smaller room also had a lovely lawn in back that
would have been a great play space for the kids.)</TE>
<TE>   During our stay we discovered many family-friendly activities at
the resort: tennis and basketball courts, a pingpong table, a
volleyball court and a croquet course. You can rent bicycles and
quadricycles, watch boats on Mission Bay and swat a ball around an
18-hole miniature golf course. The girls gave that a try with their
dad, who did an admirable Gerald Ford imitation, just missing a
Mercedes as he sent his ball first onto the roadway and then, on the
rebound, straight into a thicket.</TE>
<TE>   Janna also loved the Tower, an odd metal structure around an
81-step spiral staircase that yields a bird's-eye view of the place.
For some reason she called it the Eiffel Tower, and every time she
yelled "Who wants to climb the Eiffel Tower with me?" I had to laugh.
I should learn a lesson from her, I thought. Perhaps travel is
largely a state of mind.</TE>
<TE>   Five swimming pools are spread around the resort, but the only
heated one was the large "lagoon" pool, with a sandy beach area, near
the gift shop and health club. That's where Amanda spent much of one
morning. While she and her dad went swimming, I headed for the health
club.</TE>
<TE>   A variety of spa treatments is available: massages, facials,
Japanese soaking tubs and something called "Indonesian rituals." (I
didn't ask.) The exercise rooms and equipment cost $10 for unlimited
use throughout the day.</TE>
<TE>   Huge windows face the pool, so I was able to get a long-overdue
workout and watch my older daughter frolicking in the water. Janna
kept me company until she decided to join Paul outside. Tahiti would
have been great, but at that moment I was pretty close to the peace
and relaxation I had been hoping for.</TE>
<TE>   One afternoon we decided to relax and stay on the grounds for
lunch at the casual Barefoot Bar &amp; Grill, right on the bay, with
tables outside. A night heron, a bird that resembles a large sea gull
with a Barbra Streisand beak and a Rudy Giuliani comb-over, was eager
to nab anything the kids would toss its way. The girls were
enthralled with their feathered friend, but there was something
unnerving about watching a bird devour a huge breaded chicken strip.</TE>
<TE>   The menu had great burgers, salads and a grilled chicken sandwich
with basil mayonnaise, roasted peppers and provolone cheese. But what
made the biggest impression was the herbal teabag, a delicate white
nylon affair full of beautiful leaves and blossoms.</TE>
<TE>   After lunch we went to the Reuben H. Fleet Science Center at the
edge of Balboa Park. The center has an Imax theater and two floors of
exhibits. The main gallery, called ExploraZone 2, is filled with
hands-on science exhibits from San Francisco's Exploratorium. The
girls sat side by side and groaned as they pedaled a generator that
could light one to five spotlights, depending on how hard they
worked. They made it to No. 3, giggling and struggling to light 4 and
5. We spent a couple of hours trying out headphones that altered our
voices, a sand pendulum, magnetism displays and exhibits on sound
waves and electricity.</TE>
<TE>   For dinner we headed to the nearby Hillcrest neighborhood and the
Corvette Diner, a popular '50s-style joint with loud waitresses and
loud music. The burgers and malts were fine; the kids especially
loved the bubble gum that gets tossed in with the check. But my
favorite feature was the photo booth, which we all squeezed into for
a souvenir set of portraits.</TE>
<TE>   Another day Paul and I gave the girls a choice of activities: the
merry-go-round near Balboa Park, a puppet show in the park, an
International Dance Festival performance. We avoided mentioning the
elephant in the room, but the vote was 2-0: Sea World.</TE>
<TE>   We groaned and tried to convince them otherwise, but they could
not be swayed. As it turns out, Sea World is offering a special: a
yearlong pass for the price of a regular one-day admission ($32.95
for ages 3 to 11, $42.95 everyone older). We didn't think we would be
returning, so we chose an auto club discount instead: 20% off each
ticket.</TE>
<TE>   We loved the shark exhibit. The predators swam overhead as a
moving sidewalk took us through a tunnel in the tanks. We laughed at
the penguins, gazed in awe at huge manatees and marveled at the
shivering humans who insisted on sitting in the "splash zone" during
shows.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the day we were exhausted. This meant only one
choice for dinner: room service. Nothing makes our kids feel more
special than getting their food delivered on one of those silver
trays. When it's carried by someone other than me, I say bravo.</TE>
<TE>   We questioned the room service operator and found out about
children's entrees not listed on the limited (and expensive) menu.
Spaghetti, hot dogs, chicken fingers, and grilled cheese or peanut
butter-and-jelly sandwiches were available at reasonable prices. Paul
tried the crab cakes from Baleen, the resort's upscale restaurant,
and I had the Caesar salad.</TE>
<TE>   We settled in and tuned the TV to the John Candy movie "Uncle
Buck," whose title character reminded us all of the kids' Uncle Marc.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, we wandered over to the gift shop and market for ice
cream from the freezer case. The heated pool and spa were packed,
even though it was almost 9 p.m. Clouds of steam rising into the cool
air gave the place an otherworldly glow. The squeals and squawks of
the kids in the pool brought us back to reality.</TE>
<TE>   We were only in San Diego, but Vacation Island had fulfilled its
promise.</TE>

<LD>Slick corporate sites that trumpet Internet-only air fares and
cut-rate hotel rooms may generate more buzz in a post-9/11 landscape,
but the Web is still laced with reminders that one person's obsession
can translate to travel information that can be useful, inspiring or
amusing--or all three. A sampling:</LD>
<LD>   * Aimed at nostalgia buffs who like their lodgings "clean, quirky
and cheap," a site called Motel Americana (www.motelamericana.com)
celebrates what creators Andy and Jenny Wood describe as a "special
and poignant part of Americana--one which is slipping into
obscurity." A visitor will find photos of neon signs, vintage
postcards, "stories from the road" submitted by readers, and
commentary that's as offbeat as the postwar, pre-interstate places
the Woods commemorate. There's even a section devoted to the history
of Holiday Inn, an idea, the site says, that sprang from "a road trip
gone bad" and that morphed into "the Wal-Mart of the hospitality
world."</LD>
<TE>   * You would expect a site called "Bob's Internet Travel Tips"
(www.InternetTravelTips.com) to be glitz-free, and Bob--a.k.a. Robert
Cowen--delivers a conversational compendium of advice based on his
experiences as a Detroit-based business traveler. While some of his
tips are aimed at those who fly so often that they "see airport codes
in license plates" (a quip from the humor section), much of his
information is useful for leisure travelers as well. One current
example: "Telephone reservation service for most airlines is abysmal.
Staff cutbacks have caused long waits. You will find much shorter
waiting time for new reservations than customer service. Remember
that all agents can process almost any request or transaction."</TE>
<TE>   * You don't have to look far for proof that Robert Niles' Theme
Park Insider (www.themepark insider.com) lives up to its home page
claim of being "a truly independent source of coverage, opinion and
information about theme parks, from the people who work at and attend
them." Niles, a senior producer for Latimes.com and former trainer at
Walt Disney World, combines traditional consumer fare--bargain
roundups, hotel ratings, readers' ratings of best and worst
attractions--with insightful, pull-no-punches news and commentary.
The site's award-winning "Accident Watch," created in response to a
dearth of state and federal standards, encourages users to file their
own accident reports.</TE>
<TE>   * Launched in 1998 as the online extension of a homespun quarterly
newsletter for women travelers, Journeywoman (www.journeywoman.com)
is a perfect example of building a community in cyberspace. Creator
Evelyn Hannon, a Toronto-based entrepreneur who started traveling
solo after a divorce nearly 20 years ago, solicits--and receives in
abundance--savvy tips on everything from thwarting overly amorous
locals to "creative shopping" suggestions in Sydney, Australia. A
useful classified section helps chart trips, but the site offers as
much humor as information. Hannon's fantasy take on an airline run
for and by women: Passengers "would automatically receive a
complimentary packet containing essentials to keep their body healthy
and well groomed en route--lip balm, a small bottle of moisturizer, a
bottle of purified water, a travel toothbrush combined with mini
toothpaste and a pair of disposable tweezers. (Ask any beauty maven.
She'll tell you that the light in airline washrooms is ideal for
plucking your eyebrows)."</TE>
<TE>   * Though she can take a stern approach to bargain hunters who
don't play by her rules, Sheryl Mexic's BiddingForTravel
(www.biddingfortravel.com) remains the premier resource for advice on
how to play Priceline's name-your-own-price game. The message board's
extensive FAQs (frequently asked questions) for air fares, hotel
rooms and rental cars are invaluable for general strategies, and
would-be bidders can get the skinny on others' successes (and
failures) by checking for regional examples.</TE>

<LD>Those who believe that Kansas is a place to be visited and not just
endured will find the "2002 Getaway Guide" helpful. It lists some of
the quirkier attractions, such as the world's second largest electric
shovel, called Big Brutus and standing proudly in the town of West
Mineral, and the Garden of Eden in Lucas, where biblical scenes are
depicted in concrete. The guide also suggests several driving tours
that highlight the state's role in the Civil War and the development
of aviation. Go to www.travelks.com or call (800) 2KANSAS (252-6727).</LD>

<HD>A Montecito Preserve for the Masses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Montecito, one of the California coast's priciest residential areas,
has a park that seems much in keeping with its neighborhood. At the
San Ysidro Creek Preserve, you half expect a gated entry or valet
parking.</LD>
<LD>   The Land Trust for Santa Barbara County secured these 44 acres
along San Ysidro Creek, a part of the former estate of polo player
Elmer Boeseke. After the preserve was established in the late 1980s,
the Montecito Trails Foundation constructed and marked paths but
otherwise left the land as it was.</LD>
<LD>   A few miles of paths explore oak woodland and meander among rows
of olive trees and eucalyptus. The preserve is meant for nature study
and quiet reflection rather than picnicking and playing.</LD>
<TE>   After your hike, consider a walk around Montecito's Upper
Village--down a country lane lined with storybook cottages, past
wonderful shops and toward a terrific picnic spot, all within a mile.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: From U.S. 101 in Montecito, exit on
San Ysidro Road. Head north briefly and make a right on San Leandro
Lane. Jog left onto Hixon Road, then right back onto the continuation
of San Leandro Lane. Follow the road to a pump house, a white picket
fence and San Ysidro Creek Preserve on the north side of the lane,
where you should park.</TE>
<TE>   The hike: From the white fence, wander 100 yards and cross a
handsome stone bridge over San Ysidro Creek. After half a mile, the
path emerges from the trees and joins paved Ennisbrook Drive for 100
yards. The trail resumes and drops back to the creek.</TE>
<TE>   After a bit more woodsy walking, you'll cross another stone bridge
and reach a junction. Take the left fork, which leads to a cul-de-sac
at the end of East Valley Lane. Walk north a short way to a signed
junction with a footpath leading east.</TE>
<TE>   Follow this path to another junction. If you go straight, the path
crosses the creek, winds through a eucalyptus forest and dead-ends.
The right fork heads south, and you soon will be retracing your steps
back to the trail head.</TE>
<TE>   To explore Montecito, return to East Valley Lane and follow it
north to East Valley Road. Turn left (west) and walk half a mile to
the village's shops and restaurants. The road is busier than you
might expect, and the shoulder is narrow in places, so be careful.</TE>
<TE>   On your way into town, turn right onto Periwinkle Lane and stroll
through a wonderland of eucalyptus and oak, morning glory vines and
lovely gingerbread houses. This fairy-tale neighborhood was built in
the '30s and '40s by architect Harriet Moody. Follow Periwinkle as it
curves around to Hodges Lane; turn left onto Hodges, then right back
onto East Valley Road and resume your walk west.</TE>
<TE>   Near East Valley and San Ysidro roads, don't miss Pierre Lafond
market. Here you may buy treats for a sumptuous picnic. Head south
down San Ysidro Road a few blocks to Manning Park. Spread out your
picnic and savor the day.</TE>

<HD>Most Traveling Parents Are in Control</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For the most part, Susan Spano's list of traveling pet peeves ("Come
to Think of It, a Few Things About Traveling Are Highly Annoying,"
Her World, Feb. 10) was right on the money. That is, until I came to
her complaint about "parents who don't control their children." It
was there that I thought, "She obviously doesn't have kids."</LD>
<LD>   As a parent of three, I do my best to keep my kids in line,
whether in a four-star restaurant or at 30,000 feet. Unfortunately,
these little people have minds of their own, and sometimes parental
control has little impact, especially when they're tired or sick.</LD>
<LD>   Granted, a few parents don't have a clue, but most are responsible
and considerate. We parents are doing the best we can to make your
flight more enjoyable.</LD>
<TE>   CHRISTINA TINGLOF</TE>
<TE>   Glendale</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Among the things Spano finds highly annoying are "pedestrians who
wait for walk lights at intersections when there are no vehicles in
sight" and "Americans who behave badly in foreign lands."</TE>
<TE>   Spano is perhaps unaware that not waiting for the light most
probably violates a law in whatever land the incident might take
place and that her willful flouting of that law would make her one of
those badly behaved Americans.</TE>

<LD>Adam Berestynski demonstrated a lack of cultural and religious
sensitivity when he climbed upon the head of an ancient Buddha statue
to take the photo (Best Shot, Feb. 10). Even though the Taliban later
destroyed these, people like Berestynski also inflict lasting damage
on environmentally sensitive antiquities that deserve our respect and
care.</LD>
<LD>   The Times' selection of this photo as a "best shot" is equally
reprehensible. Such irreverent and detrimental behavior in quest of a
good picture should not be condoned nor encouraged by publicizing
photos such as his.</LD>

<LD>In response to Bill Malloy's self-serving comments ("Las Vegas for
Grown-Ups," Letters, Feb. 10): Has Malloy been visiting a different
Las Vegas than the one in Nevada? For him to say "Las Vegas is not
for kids" is ludicrous. Water parks, amusement rides, circus acts,
swimming pools etc. are but a few of the fun activities in Las Vegas
for families with kids.</LD>

<LD>Your article on Annecy ("As Time Glides By," Jan. 27) brought back
memories. I visited it for only a day before embarking on a 12-day
trek traversing Mont Blanc during a 10-week sabbatical.</LD>
<LD>   The place is spectacular and forgotten by time. While other places
in France get a lot of attention, this small, peaceful and quaint
little town was the best-kept secret. Now everybody in Los Angeles
knows about it. Hopefully, they won't make it there soon.</LD>

<CP>PHOTO: Sometimes the memorable sights are ones you don't set
out to find. Such was the case for Manhattan Beach reader Stephanie
Schaub, who toured Portugal in October 2000 with her husband, Matt.
In Sintra, the Schaubs were struck by the magnificent Palacio
Nacional, thought to be of Moorish origins. "We were snapping,
snapping, snapping shots of the castle," Stephanie says, "and we
turned around and saw these children." While most are talking or seem
lost in their own thoughts, a single boy (on the far right) notices
the camera. Says Stephanie, "My husband and I cherish this shot of
unposed Portuguese life."</CP>

<HD>Springfield Is More Than Lincoln Land</HD>
<DH>Americana rules in Illinois' capital, from the 16th
president to Route 66.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BAILEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</DL>
<LD>Abraham Lincoln once heard that a pastor in town planned to preach a
sermon on the second coming of the Lord, to which the president
replied: If the Lord had been to Springfield once, he probably
wouldn't be back again.</LD>
<LD>   But Lincoln loved the city, and with good reason. He arrived in
town in 1837, unknown and penniless, and left as president-elect.</LD>
<LD>   Before he departed Springfield for the last time in February 1861,
he told the crowd of well-wishers at the train depot how much the
city had meant in his life: "To this place and the kindness of these
people I owe everything. Here I have lived a quarter of a century,
and have passed from a young to an old man."</LD>
<TE>   Just as Springfield left its mark on Lincoln, he left an enduring
impression on the city. And like Lincoln, Springfield prospered,
growing from its unpromising founding in 1821 to the capital of
Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   Springfield has a special place in my life too. I spent several
summers working here while I was in college, and after graduation it
was the first place where I lived on my own. Living here off and on
for three years, I count it as my second hometown. I love playing
tour guide here and have returned more times than I can count since I
moved to St. Louis in the early '80s.</TE>
<TE>   Springfield is a government town, and the state capitol dominates
it physically and psychologically. To people from rural areas it's a
large city with urban problems. Chicagoans mostly look down on it as
a village. And in many ways it is a combination, a small city with
problems but with a strong sense of culture and history.</TE>
<TE>   There are a few high-rises, but it is a city of eclectic
architecture: government buildings, ornate armories, stark office
blocks, Roman columns on stone buildings, trendy glass atriums. It is
also a city of single-family homes with well-kept yards.</TE>
<TE>   More than a million visitors a year come to this city of 100,000,
an easy 100-mile drive north on Interstate 55 from St. Louis and a
half-day trip south from Chicago. For the most part they are
attracted to the Lincoln sites. A mayor of Springfield once said that
a tourist is worth more than a bushel of corn and is twice as easy to
shuck.</TE>
<TE>   But as much as the city reveres and profits from Lincoln,
Springfield has an identity beyond Lincoln's legacy. The old and the
modern exist side by side here, if sometimes uneasily. So much of
Lincoln's Springfield has given way to updating that the fate of
every pre-1865 building in town becomes a matter of national concern,
and developers and preservationists are often at each other's
throats. But both the antique and newfangled sides of the city are
worth a visit.</TE>
<TE>   When I visit Springfield with my family or friends, I take them
first to Lincoln's home at 8th and Jackson streets, now, as then, a
short walk from downtown. The home and a visitor center are part of
the four-block Lincoln Home National Historic Site, which attempts to
re-create the neighborhood as it was in Lincoln's time, down to plank
sidewalks and gas streetlights.</TE>
<TE>   Maintained by the National Park Service, the two-story home is a
faithful preservation of the solid but not showy house of a
successful attorney and his family, and it looks as it would have
around the presidential election of 1860, when Lincoln received the
delegation that informed him of his nomination to the Republican
ticket.</TE>
<TE>   The demands of modern tourism have required concessions--the
original frame of the house has been replaced by a hidden steel
structure to bear the millions of visitors--but the sense that real
people, not just the man of marble statues, once lived there is very
strong.</TE>
<TE>   About 65 pieces of furniture in the house were owned by the
Lincolns, and the rooms have a lived-in look. The toys in the
children's rooms are left sitting out, as they might have been in the
busy household. Lincoln's hat hangs in the front hall, along with
Victorian ornaments that belonged to his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln. The
Lincolns lived in the house from 1844 to 1861. It was the scene of
great happiness for them but also of great sadness and turmoil, as
one son, Edward, died at age 3, and the couple's volatile marriage
often boiled out into the street.</TE>
<TE>   The first time I visited Lincoln's house on a school field trip in
the late '60s, there was a garish souvenir shop across the street
with a sunken garden and tasteless knickknacks. To no one's regret it
was demolished, but with it went several residences and offices in
what was once a thriving neighborhood. Now only a few period houses
and Lincoln's home remain, isolated from the rest of the city and
rendering the area somewhat sterile.</TE>
<TE>   A few blocks' walk to the north leads to the Old State Capitol
State Historic Site and, facing it across a red-brick pedestrian
mall, the Lincoln Herndon Law Offices, where Lincoln practiced with
his partner and biographer, William Herndon, from 1843 to 1853.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows exactly what Lincoln's one-room office looked like,
but Herndon said Lincoln's sons ran wild on visits, scattering papers
and upsetting inkwells. The simple furnishings, a writing table
covered with papers, filing boxes and shelves of law books are not
much different from a modern law office, but Lincoln's presence makes
the office a shrine.</TE>
<TE>   By 1858 Lincoln had served four terms as a state legislator and
one term in Congress and had tried without success to secure a
government appointment. He had retired from politics and despaired of
ever leaving a mark. Following the Dred Scott decision of 1857, which
opened the territories to slavery, Lincoln decided to enter the race
for the U.S. Senate against Stephen Douglas.</TE>
<TE>   It was in the Old State Capitol, across the street from his law
offices, that he delivered his "house divided" speech. Lincoln's
words--that the country "cannot endure half slave and half
free"--propelled him into national prominence, inflamed the South
and, upon his election to the presidency two years later, sparked
secession.</TE>
<TE>   The Greek Revival, red-roofed Old Capitol was rebuilt during the
mid-1960s to re-create Lincoln's time. Knowledgeable guides in 19th
century costumes conduct tours, occasionally by candlelight. The
building displays one of the rails Lincoln allegedly split, an
artifact displayed during the 1860 campaign--much to Lincoln's
embarrassment because he did not like to romanticize his hardscrabble
past. Lincoln's body lay in state here before his burial in 1865.</TE>
<TE>   Across the street is the construction site of the $115-million,
100,000-square-foot Lincoln Presidential Library, which, when
completed next year, will combine historical attractions with serious
scholarship of Lincoln manuscripts and relics.</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln sites in Springfield are well marked by road signs, making
it easy to find the next stop on my tour: his tomb in Oak Ridge
Cemetery, a mile or so north of downtown. The ornate stone monument,
completed in 1874, is a 19th century tribute to the legend as much as
the man. His wife and three of their four children are also entombed
there.</TE>
<TE>   Before entering the somber chamber, most visitors touch the nose
on a bust of Lincoln outside the entrance for good luck. If the look
is familiar it is because it was made by Gutzon Borglum, the same
sculptor who carved Lincoln's face into Mt. Rushmore. Over the years
thousands of hands have polished the bronze to a bright copper color.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the tomb, at the base of the hill it crowns, is one of my
favorite Lincoln sites: the little-visited original tomb, dug into
the side of the hill, where the bodies of Lincoln and his son Willie,
who died in the White House, were laid while the monument was built.
The stark simplicity of the now-empty space seems closer to Lincoln's
character and more in keeping with his wishes for a simple burial
than the towering tomb where he now rests. Civil War soldiers lie
buried a few yards away, their cannon still ready to defend their
leader.</TE>
<TE>   No Lincoln pilgrimage to Springfield is complete without a visit
to New Salem State Park, about 25 miles northwest. Most of the
village of New Salem, where Lincoln spent six formative years before
moving to Springfield, has been re-created down to the smallest
detail. Curators went so far as to import sheep from Europe to
reflect the breeds that existed in the village at the time.</TE>
<TE>   In New Salem, Lincoln first studied law, first ran for the state
legislature and, depending upon which historians you believe, either
did or did not fall in love for the first time with a woman named Ann
Rutledge. The log buildings of Lincoln's two failed general stores,
the Rutledge tavern, the home where he taught himself grammar and
mathematics--there are 23 period structures in all--along with a
museum, visitor center and outdoor theater make New Salem one of the
best Lincoln sites to visit.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving the 19th century and Lincoln behind, I head to one of my
favorite spots in Springfield: In a residential neighborhood a fairly
easy walk from downtown is the Dana-Thomas house, perhaps the best
preserved of Frank Lloyd Wright's Prairie houses.</TE>
<TE>   In 1902, socialite Susan Lawrence Dana had the money ($60,000) and
the spirit to give the young architect free rein. In 1944 the house
was bought by Thomas Publishing Co., which closed the doors on the
architectural treasure for decades. In 1981 the publishers sold the
house to the state for $1 million, turning down offers of a million
for each of the four light fixtures in the dining room.</TE>
<TE>   When I entered the sprawling house for the first time, I felt as
if I were at the opening of King Tut's tomb. All of the
Wright-designed furniture and fixtures are still exactly as they were
in Dana's day. The ballroom floor was constructed on springs to
cushion it from vibrations from trains running behind the house. A
barrel with a spigot was built into the wall to dispense champagne
during parties. But in one room, a Victorian fireplace contrasts
conspicuously with the house's clean lines. Because of a provision in
her father's will, Dana was not allowed to destroy the family house,
and, to comply, Wright built the rest of the house around it.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Springfield rediscovered the Dana-Thomas House, it also is
finding its Route 66 heritage. The city was an important stop on
America's Main Street until the push for freeways routed traffic away
from downtown. As happened in many other towns, the downtown center
suffered. Now the city is making efforts to redirect traffic downtown
along Historic 66, and in September it will celebrate its first Route
66 Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Shea's Gas Station on Peoria Road is the city's unofficial museum
of Route 66 memorabilia, gathered by 80-year-old Bill Shea. The
former filling station is a privately funded labor of love, a
frequent stop for Route 66 pilgrims from around the world.</TE>
<TE>   One Route 66 site that has survived is the Cozy Dog Drive-In,
reportedly the birthplace of the corndog. As every educated person
knows, the corndog is the most perfect food: It provides protein from
the hot dog, grain from the batter, vegetables from the corn and, if
needed, fiber from the stick. The Cozy Dog is the Spago of corndog
vendors.</TE>
<TE>   Springfield's other culinary contribution to the world is the
horseshoe, an open-faced sandwich of hamburger, turkey or ham
smothered in cheese sauce and topped with French fries. Invented in
the Leland Hotel in 1928, horseshoes are served at several
restaurants in town, but I think the best may be had at Norb Andy's,
a favorite hangout for politicians, a few blocks from the state
capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Like all cities, Springfield has many hidden gems. Across from the
Old State Capitol is Prairie Archives, a bookstore and collectibles
treasury and the source for T-shirts with a quote falsely attributed
to Lincoln: "They'll have to shoot me to get me back to Springfield."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a common fantasy in Springfield has Lincoln returning to
his hometown, walking the streets, looking up the old places and
seeing if he likes what they did to his town. Lincoln would recognize
only a few buildings, but if he looked hard enough he would see the
same kind of town, where the elegant touches and the rough edges come
together as they did in his day.</TE>

<DH>The creative team behind 'NYPD Blue' orders surveillance of
two detectives. New evidence is forthcoming.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So will they or won't they?</LD>
<LD>   For several weeks, fans of ABC's "NYPD Blue" have been wondering
whether detectives Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) and Connie McDowell
(Charlotte Ross) will become romantically involved. There have been
hints that the burly widower and the beautiful but emotionally
troubled young detective share a budding attraction, with McDowell
giving Sipowicz an unexpected kiss on the cheek after turning to him
for advice regarding the daughter she gave up for adoption, and
awkward pauses between the two since then.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday's episode, which this week only will air in the show's
old 10 p.m. time slot, the two share what the network describes as an
"intimate moment." But unlike some of the "intimate moments" on "NYPD
Blue," Sipowicz and McDowell will remain fully clothed.</LD>
<TE>   Executive producer Bill Clark says that turning the characters
into a romantic couple is like walking onto a minefield.</TE>
<TE>   "I can say I don't think in all of the years on the show any
decision has had as much effort put into it as this one," says Clark,
a former NYPD detective. "Quite frankly, there has been no definitive
decision yet as to where this thing is going to go.</TE>
<TE>   "We are literally taking it one step at a time because it is such
a complicated situation, and we are just having a little fun with it
and seeing what people think."</TE>
<TE>   So far, Clark acknowledges, reactions from fans have been mixed,
largely because Sipowicz's life has been filled with so much tragedy
over the past nine seasons, including the murders of his grown son
and wife. "People don't want to see him hurt again," Clark says. "A
lot of women identify with Charlotte--a lot of women feel vulnerable
at times in their life and don't know if this is a good thing for
her. We don't know if we want to get them to consummate their
relationship in a sexual way or maybe [have Sipowicz] become a father
figure in her life. As you can see, this is going much slower than
most of our relationships."</TE>
<TE>   Because the series is steeped in reality, co-creator Steven Bochco
and company don't want Sipowicz to do something out of character.
"Sipowicz has been the constant throughout the whole show, and people
really love Sipowicz," Clark says. "If he does something that
tarnishes him, and if somebody does something wrong to him that
tarnishes the other person, it can hurt us."</TE>
<TE>   If the relationship between the two develops and grows, says
Franz, "the key is that we have to let the audience take it slowly,
so they can accept the relationship and understand the relationship
and understand the attraction and not be turned off by it. They need
to understand we don't choose who we fall in love with. For whatever
reason, we find traits in one another that we like and are attracted
to. At first glance, as we see opposites or people in a relationship
that don't look like they belong together, everybody kind of
scratches their heads. But those are the most interesting
relationships. You kind of have to dig in and find out what made that
happen."</TE>
<TE>   "Bottom line, you can search for what you think will be your right
matchup in life, but love doesn't happen that way," Ross adds.</TE>
<TE>   Ross joined "NYPD Blue" during its eighth season, just before the
departure of longtime regular Kim Delaney. "I wasn't brought on to be
involved with Dennis," she says, adding that the writers and
producers quickly picked up on their on-screen chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being moved to 9 p.m. this season, the series has
demonstrated its durability, averaging 13.5 million viewers against
stiff competition that includes NBC's "Frasier." As a result, the
producers and cast say they are already looking ahead to the
prospects of a 10th season.</TE>
<TE>   Franz, who has won four Emmys for his role on the series, loves
the interplay between himself and Ross and can't wait to see how the
relationship will play out. "I am not doing too bad for an
overweight, bald guy," he says, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   "NYPD Blue" airs this Tuesday at 10 p.m. on ABC. The network has
rated the episode TV-14-L (may be unsuitable for children younger
than 14, with an advisory for language). The series returns to its
regular 9 p.m. time slot Feb. 26.</TE>

<LD>Aside from the prominent races for district attorney and county
supervisor on the March 5 ballot, which we discussed in previous
editorials, there are several other contests for county government
and school board posts. Although they generally don't draw the
interest they deserve, seats on the county Board of Education and for
the countywide posts of clerk-recorder, assessor and public
administrator are important and merit serious consideration by
voters.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by incumbent Clerk-Recorder Gary Granville to retire
has attracted five candidates seeking the open seat. The most
qualified and deserving of election is Tom Daly, current mayor of
Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   Daly not only has city government experience but understands the
workings of county and regional government. He also is familiar with
the needs and operations of the clerk's office and the importance of
security and the timely handling of documents. He plans to increase
Internet service and work to make public demographic data readily
available. Daly has Granville's support and we too think he is best
able to provide the professionalism and leadership needed to continue
the office's efficient operation.</LD>
<TE>   The public administrator post also is open because William Baker,
director of the county Community Services Agency, is not running for
reelection. Baker, who wears three hats, will remain in the agency as
director and public guardian, positions that are appointed by the
Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   The elected administrator is responsible for handling the estates
of residents who die without a will and have no heirs or anyone
willing to administer their estates. Of the four candidates seeking
the post, Vicki Landrus is by far the most qualified and logical to
replace Baker, who has endorsed her. Landrus, a 20-year veteran in
county government, is the assistant public administrator and has the
necessary ability and experience.</TE>
<TE>   We also support the candidacy of incumbent Assessor Webster J.
Guillory. The management and technical skills he has demonstrated in
his first term make him worthy of reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the ballot are two races for the county Board of
Education. Unlike local school boards, the countywide Department of
Education, governed by the school board, furnishes many support
services for the local districts. It also provides schooling and
programs for severely handicapped children, wards of the court and
youngsters with discipline problems who are in custody in county
juvenile facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth "Liz" Dorn Parker, representing Area 5, and Del Clark,
representing Area 2, are seeking reelection to the school board. They
both deserve new terms.</TE>
<TE>   Parker, the board's senior member, is running for her sixth term.
When first elected at age 22, she was the youngest elected countywide
official in Orange County. In her 20 years of service, Parker has
distinguished herself as an educational leader, not only on the local
level but statewide.</TE>
<TE>   She is past president of the state organization of county school
boards and has been active in programs for drug abuse education,
child care, teacher retention, outdoor science programs and efforts
to reduce school dropouts. She is one of the most experienced and
able board members in the county.</TE>
<TE>   Clark, an appointed incumbent, is a retired teacher and former
member and president of the school board in Los Alamitos. Clark works
well with the other board members and understands the role of the
board in providing services to the local districts and serving as a
focal point in educational issues.</TE>
<TE>   On the ballot but unopposed for reelection are incumbent
supervisors Jim Silva and Thomas W. Wilson, Auditor David Sundstrom,
Sheriff-Coroner Michael S. Carona, Treasurer-Tax Collector John M.W.
Moorlach and county Superintendent of Schools William H. Habermehl.</TE>
<TE>   In the contested offices, voters should mark their ballots for Tom
Daly as clerk-recorder, Vicki Landrus as public administrator,
Webster J. Guillory as assessor and Elizabeth Parker and Del Clark
for the county Board of Education.</TE>

<LD>Five recent deaths are grim reminders of the value of smoke detectors
in saving lives and property. Three boys and their father who tried
to save them died after smoke and flames spread through their
Placentia home without warning. An elderly woman died in a Santa Ana
fire.</LD>
<LD>   Firefighters said that in both instances there had been a smoke
detector in place in the home, but it had been removed for
replacement or repair--and not put back before the fatal fires.
Sadly, that is an all-too-common occurrence. Fire officials say about
one-third of all residential smoke detectors in the nation are not in
working order.</LD>
<LD>   Smoke detectors have proved their value in alerting residents to
smoke and fire danger and gives them more precious time to reach
safety. Building ordinances may require them, but it is up to
residents to keep them in working order.</LD>
<TE>   Fire safety officials, anxious to make such maintenance a habit,
urge residents to check their smoke detectors at least twice a year,
when they adjust their clocks for daylight saving time.</TE>
<TE>   There is no way of knowing how many homes in Orange County do not
have an operating smoke detector, but one is one too many. There were
six deaths in residential fires in Orange County last year. And six
the year before. The fatal residential fires in Placentia and Santa
Ana are tragic reminders of the life-saving protection smoke
detectors could provide--and the wisdom of having and keeping them in
working order at home.</TE>

<HD>The Rosy Path Takes Its Toll</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>What a reality check the financing of the San Joaquin Hills tollway
has become since the early heady days of planning. Optimistic
predictions about growth and revenue provided the music to investors'
ears to get the 15-mile corridor built. Today, with ever-increasing
debt payments due and ridership falling well short of projections,
the road has been assigned junk-bond status by one Wall Street rating
agency, and the toll agency is trying to avoid falling short on
promises made to investors.</LD>
<LD>   For years, the agency has been shuffling to make the picture look
rosier. But it now seems clear the road is in real financial trouble.
One lesson of the story is that you can always find a consultant to
tell you what you want to hear when you are starting out. Back in
1992, advisors to the tollway were tallying lavish usage projections
to get the bonds sold. And as so often seems the case on major
infrastructure projects in Orange County, more modest plans fell on
deaf ears. There was a time when there could have been a smaller
road, and toll pricing might have been tailored more easily to
accommodate fluctuating demand.</LD>
<TE>   With at least one other major toll road in South County still on
the drawing boards, and in environmentally sensitive lands at that,
the need for scaled-back ambitions and better financial scrutiny
before laying pavement is obvious. Toll roads remain an alternative
when roads are congested, or when new development is really far
enough out of the way to require a fast, direct route. The other toll
roads in the Transportation Corridor Agencies' portfolio, the Eastern
and Foothill corridors, are doing better. However, the dynamics of
making a toll road work are tricky enough to warrant more care in
projections.</TE>
<TE>   And don't look to the state for a bailout; the quasi-public agency
was created to build toll roads in Orange County precisely because
the state couldn't afford to do it. If these roads are going to work,
they must be a real choice, and motorists won't make the choice if
they have free alternatives, or it's too expensive to ride. The
success of the road improvements financed by Measure M sales-tax
revenue during the 1990s has provided riders with a free route from
the south to central parts of the county. Moreover, the optimistic
job-growth projections for the toll-road corridor never materialized
after that decade's recession.</TE>
<TE>   But as the county deals with another economic downturn, it is
important also to look at the drivers' pocketbooks. Already paying
gas taxes to finance roads, voters in Orange County decided in 1990
to pay the half-cent sales tax. Now, with the toll road in trouble,
riders pay as much as $3 each way. Six dollars a day translates into
about $120 a month to come out of a family budget. Looking at having
to pay $1,400 a year for a toll road, most suburban families have to
weigh choices on how to spend that money--on club teams, braces,
summer vacation or whatever.</TE>
<TE>   When the economy is soft, people will forgo the extras. Without a
bigger base of people who must ride to avoid delay, the road today
looks as if it were built too soon.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the corridor must deal with the financial
reality. A refinancing and consolidation with boards of the other
corridors may provide a short-term fix and is probably the best
interim solution.</TE>
<TE>   The corridor agencies do need to keep the system afloat to meet
current obligations. But sooner or later, they have to find a better
way to get more cars on the road.</TE>

<HD>Toll Road Scenario May Play Out Again</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Financial Jam Mires O.C.'s Toll Highway," Feb.11:</LD>
<LD>   Due to traffic and revenue shortfalls, bonds to pay for the San
Joaquin Hills toll road may go into "technical default" within five
years. Last week, The Times reported that one Wall Street bond rating
firm has reduced some O.C. toll-road bonds to junk status. Who pays
the bondholders if the toll-road agency goes into default?</LD>
<LD>   The scenario that got us here (unrealistic growth projections by
overeager promoters), may soon have a second act. The county proposes
financing the construction of an airport at El Toro through the sale
of bonds, with debt service on the bonds to come from revenues
generated by operation of the airport. What if demand for a second
airport in Orange County does not meet the optimistic forecasts? What
if building costs exceed projections? Denver International Airport,
the most recent big airport built in the U.S., had cost overruns of
100%.</LD>
<TE>   In today's post-Enron, post-Sept. 11 financial environment,
investors are skeptical of proposals based on questionable economic
assumptions, particularly for airline-related projects. Some bonds to
pay for airport projects are currently paying as high as 16.4%
interest because of the high risk. If investors demand such high
returns on El Toro airport bonds, how could the county possibly pay
such interest? Answer: the taxpayers would pay for this
Smith/Silva/Coad white elephant, or Orange County would go into
bankruptcy--again.</TE>
<TE>   Len Gardner</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Woods</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After reading about the failing toll-road bonds, one wonders if
the same fate awaits us with the proposed El Toro airport. Both the
San Joaquin Hills tollway and the El Toro airport have no demand
study. It takes no genius to realize that if a project has no demand,
it will fail. Now the county wants to make the same mistake twice,
only this time with a multibillion-dollar airport at the former El
Toro Marine base. If the county wants us to keep letting them plan
these expensive projects, we must have a professional demand study
before we let them happen. Otherwise, we are setting ourselves up for
a second bankruptcy.</TE>

<TE>   Re "O.C. Tollway Bonds Are Downgraded," Feb. 6:</TE>
<TE>   As a citizen using the San Joaquin Hills tollway since its
inception, I have written twice to tollway authorities pointing out
that their consistent rate increases would ultimately result in less
revenue. The people managing the tollway apparently do not have a
basic understanding of economics: To encourage greater use, prices
should be reduced, not increased. I am a retired citizen on a fixed
income. I like the tollway and would use it much more if the tolls
had not been increased far more than the cost of living since its
opening.</TE>

<TE>   Re "If Toll Road Is Like Restaurant, No Reservations Are Needed"
(Dana Parsons, Feb. 8)</TE>
<TE>   Parsons accurately describes the futility of fighting a
developer's misleading statements in completing a project of dubious
merit. How do you beat them? We're fighting a similar situation in
Laguna Beach. It was unfortunately agreed upon to build a hotel on a
beautiful bluff in Laguna based on revenue projections. Laguna was to
receive millions from the bed tax. Just watch it roll into the city
coffers.</TE>
<TE>   The city manager negotiated a horrible contract with the developer
that is almost a license for them to steal. Out of a 30-plus acre
parcel, 4.7 useable acres were designated for a park that Laguna
would landscape. Many local parks of that size have been landscaped
for about $1.5 million. By contrast, the cost allocated by the
developer and supported by the city manager has now grown to $9.6
million. And, this is just to landscape a park that will be mostly
open space for people to enjoy the ocean view and have a place to
park. Plus, we have to pay interest on the total.</TE>
<TE>   So how do you beat them? If this isn't corrected, it will be 10
years or more before we see any bed-tax revenue, if even then, since
this hotel has new competition from the beautiful St. Regis, which
just opened south of Laguna.</TE>

<LD>Re ''Southland Muslims Take a PR Approach,'' Feb. 1:</LD>
<LD>   Thank you for publishing the article about California Muslims
renting billboard space with public service announcements about
Islam. It is imperative that Americans learn about Islam and its
message of peace. The Muslims of Southern California are doing a
wonderful job with their campaign by presenting Muslims for what they
are--peaceful, law-abiding citizens of the United States. Please
continue to write positive articles about Islam and Muslims so that
all Americans, regardless of race, religion, or ethnicity, can live
peacefully together.</LD>

<LD>Re "Waiting for His Day in Court Since '98," Feb. 5:</LD>
<LD>   Regardless of the outcome in Art Romo's narcotics trial, he will
always have my utmost respect. In fact, the residents of Santa Ana
will always owe him a debt of gratitude for his work in bringing
peace to our streets. Government and law-enforcement officials have
unfairly targeted Romo and other leaders of the United Gang Council
from its inception.</LD>
<LD>   Romo reached out to the troubled youths who had become entangled
in the violent world of street gangs. His message resonated with them
and gang violence dropped dramatically in Santa Ana. After years of
having these issues ignored by our political leaders, and
indifference toward the lives and well-being of young Latinos by
Chief Paul M. Walters and the Santa Ana Police Department, Romo got
results.</LD>
<TE>   I'll be pulling hard for Mr. Romo to beat the charges. We need him
out on the streets, fighting to improve the quality of life for
everyone in our community.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Fire Directors OK With Retooling Volunteers," Feb. 7:</LD>
<LD>   Interesting spin the Orange County Fire Authority has taken on the
dwindling numbers of reserve firefighters, since it has been the
authority that has chosen not to hire or train additional reserves
for more than two years. All the while, it has expected a reserve
station of 40 to provide the same level of service, but with only
nine. Where have they gone?</LD>
<LD>   Several are full-time with the OCFA, one is with the New York Fire
Department and others have been hired by Los Angeles city and county
and surrounding cities. Many of the reserves initially were hired to
gain experience as they pursued a firefighting career. Funny thing.
Just recently, the reserves at Station 32 were able to get on-scene
before the career crew, because they live in the area and know the
streets and routes.</LD>
<TE>   Too bad for the reserves, who do this not for money, but because
they love it. But I bet the union is happy.</TE>

<LD>Re "Irvine to Ask Landowners to OK Higher Tax," Feb. 9:</LD>
<LD>   I see Irvine is going to ask for a tax hike to keep parks and
streets looking good. That doesn't make sense. How can Irvine's City
Council find millions of dollars each year in an effort to kill the
county's El Toro airport plans and not have enough money to do the
things a City Council ought to do?</LD>
<LD>   My guess is the probability of two-thirds of Irvine's voters
approving any tax hike hovers somewhere between slim and none. It
seems to me the better way to get Irvine out of its financial bind is
to reject Measure W on the March 5 ballot. That way the county can
bring into operation at El Toro the commercial airport that will
produce millions of dollars each year in new tax revenue for Irvine
to use keeping its parks and streets looking good without a tax hike.</LD>
<TE>   Norm Ewers</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Did I read correctly? It appears that the city of Irvine is
seeking a tax increase to take care of its parks, streets and lights,
and is also asking for donations to fund its schools.</TE>
<TE>   Add this to the hoax of "profitable private toll roads," and
answer the following: Why should we believe that the "Great Park"
will be built without tax increases for all Orange County residents?</TE>
<TE>   Kathleen F. Klein</TE>
<TE>   Tustin</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pro-airport claims still persist that the proposed park is a tax
liability, despite the analysis to the contrary by the recent county
report. There is a serious tax question at stake in the debate over
El Toro, but it relates to county plans for an airport.</TE>
<TE>   There is no money budgeted by the county for:</TE>
<TE>   * The cost to build extra freeway lanes that airport traffic will
require (according to Caltrans) from San Clemente to Anaheim, and
east to Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   * The cost of sound insulation for 10,000 or more homes, and many
hundreds of schoolrooms.</TE>
<TE>   * The cost of the aviation rights to fly below 1,500 feet over
Laguna Woods residences.</TE>
<TE>   * The cost of a fuel delivery and storage system at the base.</TE>
<TE>   * The loss of tax revenue ($35million annually) due to the
projected loss of $3.5 billion in property values from the coast to
Anaheim and Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   * The cost of the health impact (on both the county and residents)
of the 50 daily tons of pollution that air operations will release
into the air we all breathe.</TE>
<TE>   * The possible cost to the county to make bond payments if airport
revenue is insufficient (as is the case with the California 73 toll
road revenue).</TE>
<TE>   County taxpayers should be aware that huge county tax increases
(more than $50 million annually) are very likely if we fail to pass
Measure W on March 5.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Smith</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A recent mass mailing of anti-airport literature to Orange County
residents by Measure W proponents suggests that an airport at El Toro
will cause residential property values to plummet. This statement is
not only totally inaccurate and amusing, it borders on absurdity and
insanity, as nothing could be further from the truth.</TE>
<TE>   The compelling evidence: Those residents living in the immediate
flying area of John Wayne Airport and the former El Toro Marine Corps
Air Station have seen their property values skyrocket in the past 10
years. The same high housing values have benefited the communities
surrounding John Wayne --including Irvine, Costa Mesa and
Tustin--Ontario, Burbank and other similar-sized airports.</TE>
<TE>   No comparison can or should be made with Los Angeles International
Airport, which dwarfs John Wayne and the El Toro airport in terms of
size, complexity, flight volume, population density, commercial
industries, etc. Not a shred of credible evidence has ever been
presented to indicate or project a downward spiral of home prices
when the El Toro airport becomes operational. Quite the contrary, a
modern airport attracts high technology industry, tourism, increased
trade, needed jobs, coupled with an inevitable and enviable
significant leap in home real estate prices.</TE>
<TE>   The steadfast and intelligent voters of Orange County will not be
swayed by the desperate and attempted deceptive tactics designed to
capture their votes.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Garcia</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I just read from anti-park people that my property taxes will go
up by $352 if Measure W passes. Amazing they would know this exact
figure when there isn't a single initiative on the ballot requesting
a tax increase.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County voters, regardless of their feeling about an airport
or Measure W, must realize that the only way a tax increase can occur
is if 67% of the voters approve it. That is California law.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-W pundits are banking the ignorance and scare tactics. The
choice is simple: Want a polluting, noisy, traffic-inducing airport?
Vote no on W. Don't want an airport? Vote yes. As a 37-year resident
of Orange County, I know what my choice is!</TE>
<TE>   John Berry</TE>
<TE>   Aliso Viejo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Re "Runway or Walkway? Measure W to Decide" (Orange County
commentary, Feb. 3):</TE>
<TE>   The article by opponents of Measure W is riddled with half-truths.
First, Measure W opponents cite the limited capacity at 500-acre John
Wayne. Times readers deserve to know that San Diego's 474-acre
Lindbergh Field carried 15.8 million annual passengers in 2000,
compared with 7.7 million at John Wayne. Both airports have one
commercial aircraft runway and restricted operating hours. Obviously,
if Lindbergh Field can handle 15.8 million annual passengers, John
Wayne can carry the 9.8 million that Newport Beach has agreed to in
order to obtain an extension of its present operating hours.
Increasing John Wayne from 7.7 million to 9.8 million--27%--will more
than meet the county's airport growth demand.</TE>
<TE>   Second, a $700,000 search for a suitable commercial airport site
in Orange County mandated by the county, financed principally by the
FAA and conducted by 300 Orange County citizens from November 1988 to
December 1989, overwhelmingly rejected El Toro as an appropriate site
for a large commercial airport. Although thoroughly documented in a
312-page report presented to the Board of Supervisors on April 3,
1990, the county has never made public the study's principal finding:
No suitable site for a large commercial, international airport exists
in Orange County. Not at El Toro and not at John Wayne.</TE>
<TE>   Third, no one has ever considered Palmdale as an alternative
airport for Orange County. The Airport Site Coalition Study Team
recommended 6,700-acre March Inland Port, not Palmdale or George.
March is 23 miles from El Toro, has the longest runway in California
(13,300 feet), is fully operational now, has adequate fuel storage,
low landing fees, no conflicting air traffic patterns with other
airports and is actively promoting expanded use of its facilities.
The statement by Measure W opponents that Riverside residents do not
want Orange County air passengers is false. The city of Riverside may
not, but Riverside County, Perris and Moreno Valley constitute the
joint powers authority operating March Inland Port, and they warmly
welcome Orange County airline passengers.</TE>
<TE>   And talking about future air passenger growth demand, Measure W
opponents completely ignore the underused facilities at Ontario
International Airport, whose service area includes about 80% of
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The large majority of Orange County voters who favor a central
park over an airport agree with Measure W opponents when they say,
"Let's stop bickering and join to ensure that our quality of life is
preserved and our economy is strong." The only way we can achieve
this worthy goal is to vote yes on Measure W on March 5.</TE>

<TE>   Larry Agran and the Irvine City Council should also consider
asking the Irvine residences to be assessed for the "Great Park" they
have been promoting with millions of Irvine tax dollars. According to
BBC Research Consulting of Denver, this would amount to an annual tax
increase to the city of Irvine. Of course, if Larry and his friends
can get the "Great Park" paid for by all of Orange County residences,
it will cost all of us only $604 annually. Any extra money he has
left over can be donated to the Irvine schools.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Once again The Times hits the mark, clarifying the issue of turbidity
monitoring ("Sewage Issue Gets Murky," Jan. 27), then following up
with an incisive editorial ("Stirring Up the Water," Feb. 3) and some
excellent letters from the public regarding the need for full
secondary treatment prior to ocean discharge of our sewage.</LD>
<LD>   But is there more to this than meets the eye? Turbidity analysis
is not rocket science, but automating its measurement provides a
continuous record of treatment efficacy useful for demonstrating
compliance with standards. Turbidity is not a clock to be watched. It
is measuring the pulse of the treatment process. It is also normal
practice to calibrate meter readings with traditional laboratory
tests using independent methods.</LD>
<LD>   Both are necessary, but automation is generally more
cost-effective, reliable and [makes it] easier to interpret trends.
The district has a history of spending money for high-tech equipment
to do "world-class" work, then giving up when it finds it difficult
to keep it in good working order or the results are contrary to
expectations. Thanks to the regional water board staff for doing its
job, watching the watchers. And, by the way, treating urban runoff
only attempts to divert our attention from the main problem, better
sewage treatment.</LD>

<LD>Re "Wade: Right Choice for D.A.," (editorial, Feb. 3):</LD>
<LD>   Thank you for backing the district attorney candidate with
integrity, Wally Wade. You have certainly stepped up to the plate and
made the right call. I am amused that our current district attorney,
Tony Rackauckas, is seeking reelection as our "tough" D.A. Is this
the same man who shows no personal responsibility for what has
happened under his watch? He claims that it was a "routine" audit
when questioned about why the grand jury formed a committee to hear
sworn testimony, investigating his practices while in office.</LD>
<LD>   We, the taxpaying public, deserve better from our elected
officials. This is the top law enforcement position in the county,
and Orange County is the fifth-largest agency of its kind in the
nation. Surely we can do better than the present bully who is using
the office to further his own personal interests at our expense. Time
to send him packing and get a district attorney willing to police his
own and be policed, if necessary. As a civil litigator, I find our
district attorney's lack of personal accountability as the legal
watchdog in the county morally reprehensible.</LD>

<HD>Overturn Assessment Ruling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK S. GAUGHAN</AU>
<BD>Mark S. Gaughan is chairman of the Orange County
Taxpayers Assn.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Proposition 13 sets the property tax rate at 1% of assessed value in
the base year (the year in which the property was built or last
sold). Assessment increases are limited to 2% per year above that
base, even if a property's market value increases at a faster rate.</LD>
<LD>   Although assessment increases are limited, assessments can be
decreased at any rate when properties lose market value because of
destruction, depreciation, obsolescence or a depressed real estate
market.</LD>
<LD>   When depressed properties regain value, the practice of county
assessors statewide is to raise assessments at any rate up to the
adjusted base value (original base value, plus 2% per year). In other
words, the 2%-per-year limit on assessment increases does not apply
to ''recapturing'' value lost temporarily during a downturn.</LD>
<TE>   In a recent court case, Orange County Superior Court Judge John M.
Watson redefined ''base value.'' He ruled that it goes down when a
property is assessed at a lower value, even if ownership hasn't
changed. The effect of the court's ruling is that the rate of
increase is limited to 2% per year from every new, lowered base
value.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, the court's ruling applies only to Robert Pool, a Seal
Beach taxpayer whose assessed value remained flat for a year, then
was adjusted upward by more than 2% when the property's value caught
up with the market the following year. Pool sued and won a tax rebate
of $100.</TE>
<TE>   The wider significance of the ruling lies in two things that may
happen next. First, the court may grant the case class-action status,
so that it would apply to all Orange County taxpayers who had
experienced decline and recovery of property value. Second, the
ruling may be made retroactive for four years.</TE>
<TE>   If both of these things happen, schools, cities, special districts
and Orange County may be required to refund up to $432 million. If
class-action status and retroactivity were to be applied statewide,
the refund could be 10 times that. Unlike the federal and state
governments, local governments are heavily dependent on property
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   They would be hit hard if the court were to grant the Pool case
class-action status and make it retroactive. Ironically, it is local
agencies that provide services we need and usually don't mind paying
for: police and fire protection, jails, schools, parks, libraries,
streets, sidewalks, street lights, landscaping, garbage collection,
water and sanitation systems. The services of the federal and state
governments generally are less useful and more often distributed
according to political opportunism rather than need.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, the Orange County Taxpayers Assn. (OCTax) agrees with the
economist Milton Friedman that, "There's no such thing as a bad tax
cut." It's tempting to jump on the antitax celebratory bandwagon over
the court's ruling. But a tax cut should be fair and consistent.</TE>
<TE>   Under the ruling, only the lucky few whose property happens to go
down in value, then up, will realize the continuing benefit of having
all future taxes calculated on a lower adjusted base. The rest of us
probably will pay more for governmental services as a result.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial property owners will benefit most, and most unfairly,
by this ruling. Commercial properties fluctuate in value more widely
and more often than do residential properties. The dot-com collapse
last year will allow many commercial landlords to seek lower
assessments this year.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling will lock in the lower assessments, preventing the
assessor from recapturing value when commercial properties regain
their strength. The lost revenue will be made up by taxes borne
disproportionally by homeowners. The assessor has the discretion, but
not the obligation, to reduce assessments when market values decline.</TE>
<TE>   OCTax is pleased that Orange County Assessor Webster Guillory has
voluntarily lowered assessments, even in the absence of appeals by
taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   If the court's ruling stands, such reductions will be locked in
place as long as the owners hold the properties. A future, less
ethical assessor may be unwilling to reduce assessments, because he
or she will be unable to recoup the losses when the market rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Guillory has been ''recapturing'' lost value ethically and
correctly in accordance with statewide practice. He may appeal the
court's ruling. OCTax urges him to do so. The ruling is a windfall to
a few taxpayers, but it is unfair to the majority. OCTax hopes and
believes it will be overturned on appeal.</TE>

<HD>Traffic Is Driven by Poor Planning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHIRLEY L. GRINDLE</AU>
<BD>Shirley L. Grindle is a longtime civic activist in
Orange County.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the exception of police and fire protection, planning is the
most important function local government provides. Through this
process, planners and elected officials determine the quality of
life, public safety, aesthetics and property values of communities.</LD>
<LD>   One important factor is the improvement, or lack thereof, of
streets and intersections operating below the acceptable "level of
service." Level of service is a traffic engineering term that gauges
the performance of an intersection or roadway by the length of time
it takes to move through it.</LD>
<LD>   The state has determined that levels of service below a certain
value require the addition of turn lanes and the widening of roads.
Without the required improvements, traffic flow, accessibility and
neighborhood congestion soon become major headaches to both the
community and elected officials.</LD>
<TE>   As part of the required California Environmental Quality Act
review, developers must pay fees to the local jurisdiction to
mitigate traffic increases if the level of service decreases below a
certain value. These Traffic Safety Improvement Program fees are
placed in the city's traffic safety fund and are to be used for
upgrading the affected intersections and roadways.</TE>
<TE>   These improvements, however, are often never accomplished or
facilitated by the local jurisdiction. In fact, the fees collected
from a developer for specific street and intersection improvements
often are diverted to street projects elsewhere in the city or
allowed to accumulate in the traffic mitigation fund. The dire
problem created by this is compounded when the city continues to
approve developments that contribute even more traffic to
intersections and roadways that are already over capacity.</TE>
<TE>   This irresponsible and ill-conceived planning has significantly
diminished the quality of life in many Orange County communities. The
effect is readily apparent in the east Orange area.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last few years, Orange has approved several large-scale
residential developments for which the mandated traffic safety funds
have been collected. But no intersection improvements have been made,
and the city continues to approve development projects that have more
effect on overloaded intersections.</TE>
<TE>   In all fairness, Orange is not alone. Virtually every city in the
developing parts of Orange County is guilty to some degree of this
practice. All too often, the developers get their projects approved,
the city collects its traffic safety funds, and the community gets
more and more traffic congestion because the street improvements are
not made.</TE>
<TE>   Either the cities are not collecting enough funds to make the
necessary intersection improvements in a timely fashion, they are
misusing the funds, or both.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange, one has only to look at the communities around the
intersection of Santiago Canyon Road and Cannon Avenue during rush
hour to get a clear picture of the damage heaped upon our
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   There is no better example of this "build now, worry about the
traffic later" mentality than the Serrano Heights and Santiago Hills
II projects in east Orange. Both of these approved developments will
contribute substantially to the congestion and gridlock that already
exist at the Santiago Canyon-Cannon intersection.</TE>
<TE>   Although traffic safety funds were collected from the developers
of Serrano Heights, no improvements to the intersection have been
made by Orange even though the development is complete. Santiago
Hills II will soon add additional traffic to this same intersection,
but the only mitigation being proposed thus far is the usual payment
of traffic safety funds to the city.</TE>
<TE>   The city's five-year capital improvement plan does not include
this intersection even though the Santiago Hills II development is
expected to be built out within that time. Unbelievably, another
development proposal recently has been submitted to the city, which,
if approved, will add several hundred homes just 500 feet from this
already severely congested intersection. Of course, the city will
"mitigate" the traffic by collecting the traffic safety funds. Based
on past performance, the developer will get his project approved, the
city will collect the traffic safety fees, and the community will
continue to suffer.</TE>
<TE>   These indefensible practices over time have diminished our quality
of life and local public safety. The effects of traffic are realized
as soon as people move in, not several years later. The intent of the
California Environmental Quality Act is to identify and mitigate
problems, not merely to identify and collect fees.</TE>
<TE>   Fixing roads and intersections should be concurrent with housing
construction. It is time that we as a community proclaim enough is
enough, and become actively involved in demanding that no more
developments be approved until the backlog of improvements is
completed.</TE>

<LD>Re "Chris Norby for Supervisor"--(editorial, Feb.10):</LD>
<LD>   Your endorsement of Chris Norby for Orange County supervisor is a
step in the right direction. Not only does Chris exemplify leadership
through his public stance against an El Toro airport, but also
through his determination to end senseless spending of taxpayer
dollars by abolishing the Project Labor Agreement (PLA) covering
county public construction.</LD>
<LD>   The PLA causes more damage than good on county construction, and
Norby is aware of that. It causes problems for both union and
nonunion contractors trying to bid work in the county. Union
contractors cannot use the majority of subcontractors in the county
because they are not union members and won't bid the work. Nonunion
contractors are cut out of the bidding unless they promise to use
union labor and leave their people at home. Chris Norby understands
these economic principles and is the choice for boosting the economy
in Orange County and keeping people working.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You favor Norby ''to get the political horses on the Board of
Supervisors more in step with the electorate.'' The facts are that
supervisors Cynthia P. Coad, Chuck Smith and Jim Silva are very much
in step with their electorate, doing a remarkable job of working out
positive resolutions to the county's wants and needs, including
responding very well to the electorate's passage of measures A and S
on the airport.</TE>
<TE>   A past election contender against Silva, Dave Sullivan, was
showered with millions in South County money and lost decisively.
Notice Sullivan is not doing a retry against Silva, who is serving
extremely well. In a similar way, Norby is being showered with South
County money to defeat Coad. Coad will be reelected by those who know
the excellent job she is doing for them.</TE>
<TE>   You say about candidate Norby that, ''Facts and logic sway him.''
If that were true, he would not be for the "Great Tax," the Great
Park. Seems that what is swaying him more than anything is campaign
money from South County.</TE>
<TE>   His 17-year record on his city's council would speak for itself.
Anyone who must rely on so much outsider money may be carrying a
bagful of insider problems.</TE>
<TE>   You compare Norby with Supervisor Todd Spitzer, someone who likes
to stir the pot. Those traits are more those of an obstructionist and
agitator than a problem-solver.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Jashinski</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I agree with The Times endorsement. I had the pleasure of meeting
Norby at the Feb. 5 Fullerton City Council meeting, where he voted in
favor of a resolution against the Orange County Sanitation District's
301(h) waiver renewal. Norby has a refreshing way of presenting his
findings. His crystal-clear logic supports a no-nonsense, proactive
approach to city politics. Get ready Orange County; good things are
about to happen.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Jewell</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was thrilled to see The Times editorial recommending Chris Norby
for supervisor over Cynthia P. Coad and agree that the Board of
Supervisors needs a change. Norby would be a welcome one. With all
the public concern about water quality, we need public officials who
are proactive in getting rid of the Clean Water Act waiver. I wish I
could vote for him instead of Jim Silva, who is my district
supervisor. Silva still is silent about the waiver.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was pleased to see your endorsement of Chris Norby for
supervisor. In 1982, I was elected to the La Palma City Council and
met all my peers. Norby was dedicated, loved his constituents and was
steadfast in his call to serve the citizens of Fullerton. For years,
he walked the precincts at every election and I would hope that he
will continue to do so, even for this election.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County will need someone with Chris' keen and inquiring
mind to make good decisions for this new decade of challenges.</TE>

<DH>With all four reaching aerial finals, they're thinking
sweep. Women get shut out, as Switzerland's Leu sets world mark in
qualifying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>"Weird Eric" Bergoust has an idea that suddenly doesn't sound so
strange. He thinks the American men can sweep the medals in freestyle
aerials.</LD>
<LD>   That didn't seem so outlandish Saturday, after the entire American
team--Bergoust, Joe Pack, Brian Currutt and Jeret Peterson--earned
spots in the 12-man Olympic final.</LD>
<LD>   "Our goal is to go for broke and sweep the podium," said Bergoust,
the 1998 gold medalist. "It's not unrealistic to think so. That's
what we've got to start thinking about. We've got to set those
goals."</LD>
<TE>   The men are America's only hope for a medal in aerials. Tracy
Evans and Brenda Petzold failed to qualify for the women's final. The
highlight of that qualifying round was Swiss star Evelyne Leu's world
record.</TE>
<TE>   Leu flipped, twisted and spun her way to a two-jump score of
203.16, breaking a four-year-old record of 200.21 held by Xiaoou Ji
of China.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think gold medal, or world record or anything," Leu
said. "I just wanted to do my jump."</TE>
<TE>   By nailing a pair of his quadruple twisting-triple flips, Bergoust
finished second in qualifying, behind Alexei Grichin of Belarus. Pack
was third, Peterson seventh and Currutt 10th.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know I could be this happy," said Peterson, who made the
Olympic team when women's aerialist Emily Cook dropped out because of
injury. "This is definitely the best day of my life. Hopefully, it
will be the second-best day of my life come Tuesday. I'm loving it."</TE>
<TE>   The optimism was overflowing among the Americans, especially
Bergoust, the offbeat champion who sketches out jumps on cocktail
napkins, and whose coach once called him a Mozart on skis.</TE>
<TE>   But they know there are other countries, and other athletes, who
are good at this sport too.</TE>
<TE>   Grichin is the defending world champion. Canadians Steve Omischl
(third) was the 2000 rookie of the year and countryman Jeff Bean
(ninth) finished second at an event on this course in January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "I think anyone could win," Bean said. "There's going to be a ton
of pressure on the Americans. Just look at it out there."</TE>
<TE>   The pro-American crowd of 14,137 also got a look at the most
intriguing prospect for Tuesday's final, eighth-place qualifier Ales
Valenta of the Czech Republic.</TE>
<TE>   If the weather is good and the conditions are right, Valenta will
try a quintuple-twisting triple flip in the finals, a trick with one
more twist than what the best in the world have ever tried in
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Valenta landed the trick in practice earlier in the week. He
concedes, however, that he has done that only a handful of times in
very limited practice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like you go out there and do 40 every day," he said.
"You do a few, and hope it's going to be a lucky shot."</TE>
<TE>   Bergoust doesn't want to leave anything to luck. He tinkered with
the quint-twist last summer but didn't like his form.</TE>
<TE>   So, he resorted to an old standby--the quad-twist, which is the
same jump he used at the Olympics in 1994, and in 1998, when he won
gold.</TE>
<TE>   He came into these games the top-ranked aerialist in the world,
and while his appearance on the medal stand wouldn't shock anyone,
the quick ascent of the rest of the Americans would surely be a
surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, it's the Olympics, and the Americans figure there's
nothing wrong with thinking big.</TE>
<TE>   "Just go for it," Currutt said. "I've got nothing to lose. Today
was the important day. You had to put your feet down twice to get
into the finals. So come Tuesday, it's just let it rip and go for the
gold."</TE>

<HD>Bjoerndalen Triples Fun With Olympic Feat</HD>
<DH>Norwegian wins men's 12.5-kilometer pursuit to become first
biathlete to win three gold medals in Winter Games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three biathlon events, three dominant performances and three gold
medals for Ole Einar Bjoerndalen.</LD>
<LD>   In a sport that combines the rigor and intensity of cross-country
skiing with the precision and calm of marksmanship, no one has been
better than Bjoerndalen at the Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   The Norwegian became the first biathlete to win three gold medals
in the Winter Games as he dominated the men's 12.5-kilometer pursuit
Saturday at Midway, Utah, despite two shooting mistakes.</LD>
<TE>   Raphael Poiree of France won the silver and Ricco Gross of Germany
took the bronze.</TE>
<TE>   "Throughout the race, I wasn't really worried that the others
would catch up with me," Bjoerndalen said. "But I never thought I
would get three gold medals before I came here.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, this is really amazing."</TE>
<TE>   The Americans had a strong showing with Jay Hakkinen starting 26th
and finishing 13th--the best showing for an American in any
individual biathlon event. Jeremy Teela was 23rd and Lawton Redman
was 52nd. The previous U.S. best had been 14th, accomplished four
times.</TE>
<TE>   "To see that curse broken is a huge achievement," Hakkinen said.
"The only thing better would have been a medal."</TE>
<TE>   Bjoerndalen began the event 29 seconds ahead of Germany's Sven
Fischer based on results from Wednesday's 10K sprint.</TE>
<TE>   It was a sizable lead that easily could have disappeared with a
few missed shots. And it almost did, as Bjoerndalen missed his first
shot and had to ski a penalty loop that cost him valuable time.</TE>
<TE>   But the three-time Olympian made up the lost seconds on the
Soldier Hollow course and cruised to victory, even with another late
miss. He made 18 of 20 shots.</TE>
<TE>   He was so far ahead that he stopped pushing with a few meters to
go, pumped his poles twice in the air, coasted across the finish and
still won by 43 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Bjoerndalen covered the course in 32 minutes 34.6 seconds. Poiree,
always strong in pursuit events, started more than a minute behind
and rallied for second with one penalty. It was his first medal.</TE>
<TE>   Poiree's finish makes him part of the first married couple to win
medals while competing for different countries. His wife, Liv Grete
Poiree of Norway, won the silver in the 15K individual race Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Gross, a four-time Olympian, picked up his sixth medal after
finishing fourth twice at these games and getting edged in both
races.</TE>
<TE>   "I had nothing to lose," said Gross, who misfired twice during his
last of four stops at the shooting range.</TE>
<TE>   That cost him any shot at catching Bjoerndalen, who has controlled
all three men's biathlon events at Soldier Hollow.</TE>
<TE>   He blew away the field in the 20K individual race Monday, winning
by more than 36 seconds, and won the 10K event going away two days
later.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With top biathletes Magdalena Forsberg and Liv Grete Poiree
missing the podium for the first time this season, Russian Olga
Pyleva won the gold medal in the women's 10K pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   Pyleva missed only one of 20 shots at the Soldier Hollow range and
completed the course in 31 minutes 7.7 seconds to win her first gold.</TE>
<TE>   While discussing the race in an interview room, Pyleva's cell
phone rang. It was her mother calling from Siberia, where it was the
middle of the night. The call brought Pyleva to tears.</TE>
<TE>   "She was crying also, on the other side of the line," Pyleva said.</TE>
<TE>   Kati Wilhelm of Germany missed four times but made a strong
comeback to take the silver. Irina Nikoultchina of Bulgaria won the
bronze.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Medal Would Be a Stretch</HD>
<DH>Todd Hays' two-man team sits in fifth place, but .21
deficit might be too much to make up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRY TEMKIN</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Olympic men's bobsled team hasn't quite been able to put it
all together. Maybe it's bad equipment. Maybe it's a bad start or bad
driving. Or maybe it's just bad luck.</LD>
<LD>   When you put it all together, it amounts to a 46-year Olympic
medal drought, and that dry spell looks safe for at least one more
week.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe U.S. drivers Todd Hays and Brian Shimer can get it together
next Friday and Saturday in the four-man bobsled. In the two-man
event Saturday at Utah Olympic Park, things came apart, as they
almost always seem to when U.S. bobsledding and the Olympics collide.</LD>
<TE>   Hays and brakeman Garrett Hines stood fifth after the first two
runs with a time of 1 minute 35.41 seconds, .21 of a second behind
third-place Martin Annen of Switzerland, with two more runs today.</TE>
<TE>   Third is the best Hays can reasonably hope for, because he trails
second-place Christoph Langen of Germany by a substantial .35.
Langen, who won the two-man bronze medal in the 1998 Games in Nagano,
was at 1:35.06, only .01 behind Switzerland's Christian Reich.</TE>
<TE>   Shimer, competing in his fifth Winter Olympics, was ninth in
1:35.91 with brakeman Darin Steele and blamed that disappointing
finish in part on sled runners that were not a good match for
Saturday's relatively balmy temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   Hays blamed his sled's performance on himself and Hines.</TE>
<TE>   "The first run, the start was great and I didn't drive well," said
Hays, who established himself as a star on the 2001-02 World Cup
circuit. "You can't expect to drive like that and beat the Swiss and
Germans.</TE>
<TE>   "The second run, I drove well, but we didn't start well."</TE>
<TE>   Hays and Hines had the second-best start time in the first heat
but slipped to eighth on their second try. Hays had admitted to a
case of the jitters on the eve of his first Olympic race but wasn't
certain if that was a factor Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Nerves may have been part of it, I'm not sure," he said. "I just
know I didn't drive real well."</TE>
<TE>   "It happens. It just can't happen in the Olympic Games."</TE>
<TE>   Although .21 of a second is a healthy deficit, the former college
linebacker and national championship kickboxer isn't giving up. Hays
figures that if he could fall that far behind in two runs, he can
close the gap in two more.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if we can put another one like this with a good start,
we've got a chance, " he said, referring to his second-run driving.
"But it's going to have to take two smokers, no doubt about it."</TE>
<TE>   Langen, considered the top driver here, has three Olympic medals
in two Games. Reich's highest finish in three Winter Games is a
fourth in the two-man sled in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Langen, though, recently had to replace injured brakeman Marco
Jakobs with Markus Zimmermann. Reich had an edge of .06 on Langen on
their starts Saturday, but the German made up almost all of that with
his unequaled driving.</TE>
<TE>   "Differences of a hundredth of a second are what make this sport
interesting," Reich said. "Tomorrow, it doesn't matter if you're the
hunter or the hunted. We both have gold in our sights."</TE>

<LD>Canada's unbeaten women's curling team clinched a spot in the
semifinals Saturday while the U.S. women's team remained in
contention and the U.S. men's team moved close to elimination.</LD>
<LD>   In women's competition, Canada, the defending gold medalist, won
twice with 9-4 victories over Japan and Denmark to improve its record
to 8-0 with only one game remaining.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. women stayed in contention for a semifinal berth with two
victories. In the early game, they routed Russia, 11-4, and in the
late game, they rallied to get by Germany, 7-6. The U.S. and Germany
are tied for the fourth and final semifinal berth with 4-3 records
and two games remaining.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. skip Kari Erickson led her team's early victory when she made
a game-breaking shot in the fifth to give the Americans an 8-0 lead.
"It was very nice to pull out big shot," said Stacey Liapis,
Erickson's sister and teammate. "We just haven't been able to pull
them off for a while."</TE>
<TE>   In other games, Britain beat Denmark, 8-6; Germany beat Sweden,
7-5; Sweden edged Switzerland, 8-7; and Norway beat Japan, 8-5. Medal
round begins Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In men's competition, Denmark defeated the U.S., 9-7, putting the
Americans (3-4) in seventh place with two games remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden beat Finland, 11-4; Switzerland defeated Britain, 10-4; and
Norway beat Germany, 10-5. Germany and Switzerland are tied at 4-3
for the fourth and final semifinal slot. Norway and Canada lead the
men's standings with 6-1 records.</TE>

<HD>Pelletier, Sale Get Gold Tonight</HD>
<DH>Weary of attention, Canadian pair prepares for repeat medal
ceremony, which Russians want to attend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>David Pelletier wants to get back to a normal life, one without TV
cameras continually thrust in his face and reporters analyzing his
every word.</LD>
<LD>   That's not likely to happen for a while. Certainly not tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Pelletier and partner Jamie Sale will get their duplicate pairs
figure skating gold medals tonight at the Salt Lake Ice Center, after
the original dance phase of the ice dancing competition. The
International Olympic Committee voted to award them the medals after
a French judge was found to have acted improperly during the pairs
competition, which was won by Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze
of Russia.</LD>
<TE>   Sale and Pelletier are only beginning to consider the many
endorsements offered. There's talk of a made-for-TV movie, booking
their own skating tour, a skate-off against the Russian pair, and
other commercial opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   First, though, they'll get their medals. It wasn't immediately
clear if the Russians and the third-place finishers from China, Xue
Shen and Hongbo Zhao, would attend, but Sikharulidze said he wanted
to attend. "If there is a ceremony and the Canadian flag is raised,
the Russian flag should be raised and the Russian anthem should be
played," Sikharuldize said.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight will be the Canadians' first time on the ice in several
days. They've been too busy to train much since the events that began
last Monday, when they won the silver medal after judges ranked
Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze ahead of them in the long program by a
5-4 score.</TE>
<TE>   The International Skating Union reversed that decision Friday, but
Sale and Pelletier have not spoken with the Russians, who have
expressed feelings of dismay over the circus the post-competition
fuss has become.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't going to be a love fest, and this isn't going to
become Nancy and Tonya," said the Canadian duo's agent, Craig Fenech,
referring to the sensational 1994 incident in which associates of
Tonya Harding's husband plotted to injure rival Nancy Kerrigan.</TE>
<TE>   Sale and Pelletier resent being pitted against the Russians,
maintaining they want nothing more out of the incident than ensuring
reforms are instituted to prevent a similar situation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to deal with it the best I can," Pelletier said
Saturday at a news conference the Canadian Olympic Assn. said would
be the pair's last public interview. "I feel like I'm a target here,
every time I step on stage. I'm doing this," he said, weaving from
side to side, "[dodging] bullets.</TE>
<TE>   "I did feel a little bit guilty for what happened, but I didn't
ask for this. I am not a criminal, even though I feel that way when I
step out of this room.</TE>
<TE>   "All I want is my life to be normal. But I'm not stupid and naive
enough to think that will happen soon."</TE>
<TE>   Fenech said the couple has not signed an ice show contract. He
knows, though, they would be a marquee attraction.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not signed with any tours, and we have turned down all
endorsement opportunities until this moment," said Fenech, who has
represented baseball players as well as radio and TV personalities.</TE>
<TE>   However, Fenech knows the shelf life of this now-hot duo won't
last forever. "It is important to do things sooner," he said, "but
we'd rather do them right than do them early. We're looking to secure
their future."</TE>
<TE>   Sale described the last few days as overwhelming and said she and
Pelletier have not decided whether they will defend their world title
next month in Japan. "We have to have a schedule every day," she
said. "We're trying to get our lives back to normal. Training is a
priority. We want to start skating."</TE>

<LD>Sasha Cohen slipped back into town Friday night under the cover of
darkness.</LD>
<LD>   Quick! Lock up the women and children.</LD>
<LD>   Cohen stands 4 feet 11 on her tiptoes and weighs 90 pounds, but
before the Winter Olympics opened nine days ago she was casting a
giant shadow over the figure skating competition.</LD>
<TE>   "Queen, Sweetheart, Villain," shouted the headline in one
newspaper over a story featuring the three women representing the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   The queen, of course, is Michelle Kwan.</TE>
<TE>   The sweetheart is Sarah Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   Guess which role that leaves for Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   What did she do to deserve this wicked reputation?</TE>
<TE>   Not much, really. During the warmup before the freestyle program
in the U.S. championships last month at Staples Center, she and Kwan
brushed against each other. If a police officer had been following
them, he would have given a ticket to Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   It wouldn't have been her first. That might have been the first
accident that she caused, but she is well known among the other
skaters for her recklessness during practices.</TE>
<TE>   "Watch out, Sasha," is a common refrain.</TE>
<TE>   Some might believe she is too aggressive. If so, she wouldn't be
the first in her sport. Anett Poetzsch, who won the gold medal for
East Germany in 1980, was like a freight train on the ice, yielding
to no one.</TE>
<TE>   France's Surya Bonaly once did a back flip in Midori Ito's face
during a practice. Ito responded the next day by performing three
double axels in a circle around Bonaly.</TE>
<TE>   Oksana Baiul was another who never stepped aside for anyone else,
causing a frightening collision with Germany's Tanja Szewczenko
during a practice the day before the women's final eight years ago in
Lillehammer.</TE>
<TE>   Katarina Witt was the toughest competitor of all, although her
actions fell more into the category of passive aggressive. She
infuriated her rivals during practices by skating her program to
their music, then stood against the sideboards and glared at them
when she was off the ice. They so were intimidated they almost
melted.</TE>
<TE>   But those who know Cohen, 17, from Laguna Niguel, contend she
actually isn't very aggressive. They say it's more likely that she's
self-absorbed. She's not always aware of where the other skaters are
on the ice because she's not paying attention to them.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be really silly if I try to follow other skaters because
I wouldn't get my stuff in and we can get hurt," she says. "I just
focus on myself."</TE>
<TE>   If it makes the other skaters feel better, she doesn't pay any
attention to John Nicks, either.</TE>
<TE>   Asked after practice Saturday if Cohen had added anything new to
her program, her coach shrugged and said, "She hasn't told me about
anything."</TE>
<TE>   No one was injured last month in Los Angeles, and although Kwan
said she was unnerved by the near-collision, she skated superbly and
won her sixth national championship.</TE>
<TE>   End of story.</TE>
<TE>   Not quite.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the media made much ado about the incident at Staples
Center, and, although it might seem as if there is not much of an
explanation for it, I believe I have one.</TE>
<TE>   They missed Tonya Harding.</TE>
<TE>   When the Olympics began, it had been eight long, mostly tedious
years in the figure skating world since l'affaire Tonya-Nancy, and it
appeared as if the only way to re-create that adrenaline rush was to
create a good-vs.-evil scenario.</TE>
<TE>   We needed a black swan.</TE>
<TE>   Tara Lipinski had been too cute, Kwan too regal, Hughes too sweet.
Even the Russian contenders, Irina Slutskaya and Maria Butyrskaya,
were nice. Cohen, who had been the sweetheart two years ago when she
emerged as a surprise runner-up to Kwan in the national
championships, would have to play the bad girl.</TE>
<TE>   Then the sport of figure skating, as it does occasionally, rushed
to the rescue, providing an even juicier melodrama. This one involved
the intrigue of the old Cold War rivalry between the West Bloc and
the East Bloc, clandestine meetings, allegations of a swindle, a
femme fatale French judge, an emotional deathbed confession (OK, I
made that part up for the sure-to-come TV movie) and--voila!--figure
skating is back on the front pages.</TE>
<TE>   So Cohen, who left Salt Lake City after the opening ceremony to
resume training at Lake Arrowhead, arrived back in town quietly. She
was in a practice group Saturday afternoon with Kwan, Hughes and a
Japanese skater and not only did nothing happen, there were hardly
any media there to witness it not happen.</TE>
<TE>   It's no longer the story.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it never was.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen and Nicks have been trying to tell us that for a month.</TE>
<TE>   So has Kwan.</TE>
<TE>   "People tend to look at things in detail, particularly the media,"
she said here last week. "First, it was that I was coachless, which
was a big deal--a big deal for me. Then it's the warmups, which
weren't."</TE>
<TE>   Let's move on to a real drama, such as whether Anton and Elena
will stand on the victory podium next to Jamie and David when they
all receive their gold medals tonight.</TE>

<HD>Advantages Are Easy to Pin Down</HD>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The joy of pin-trading is in the collecting, not the collection.</LD>
<LD>   "Trading a pin is like breaking bread with the world," said Marlee
Baker of Springfield, Mo. "I can, within an hour, meet people from
France, Mexico, China. There's nothing like it."</LD>
<LD>   The true connoisseur tries to amass the most pins while spending
the least money.</LD>
<TE>   To start the collection, just ask. Even if you don't have anything
to offer in return. This is especially true at the start of the
Games, when reporters, sponsors and Olympic representatives are
loaded with pins.</TE>
<TE>   A good place to start is outside the Main Media Center, where
journalists pass back and forth.</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, be nice," said Baker, who has traded pins at every
Olympics since Calgary in 1988. "These people are busy. If they want
to stop, they'll stop. But all of them have a pocket full of pins.
Don't let them kid you."</TE>
<TE>   Reporters carry pins with the logo of their newspapers or
broadcast companies.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all of them lack official Olympic affiliation, so you won't
find the famous rings or that year's logo.</TE>
<TE>   The sponsor pins have the official design in addition to the
company logo, and representatives are more than happy to hand them
out. Some of them are quite functional, such as the Xerox pin with a
working thermometer. But wear too many of them and you'll start to
look like a NASCAR driver.</TE>
<TE>   Pins from foreign countries can be obtained firsthand if you
should happen upon an athlete or other members of the "Olympic
family" (as they're called).</TE>
<TE>   Kids do well in attracting freebies. So do people who work in
high-traffic areas, such as a restaurant hostess or
security-checkpoint volunteer.</TE>
<TE>   So those are some of the first people to seek for trading after
acquiring a little cache of pins. In addition to official pin-trading
areas, people set up little swap shops at corners all over towns that
host Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Shop around; avoid the pins you see frequently, then try not to
look too excited when you see a new pin that you absolutely must
have.</TE>
<TE>   Be prepared to surrender multiple pins to get one of the hot pins.
(Law enforcement pins are big at these Games). That's why it's worth
keeping any free pin that comes your way.</TE>
<TE>   If you want to buy, the Salt Lake Olympic Committee has put out
pins to commemorate everything, including the introduction of the
mascots, St. Patrick's Day and the countdown until the opening
ceremony. But you don't have to stick to the official, authentic
pins. There's a popular set of renegade pins here that make fun of
the Olympic scandal by counting down "200 Bribes to Go," "100 Bribes
to Go," etc. One of the most sought-after pins in Atlanta in 1996
depicted a wacky NBA power forward's head, with the word "Rodman." It
was heat-sensitive; rub it, and Dennis' hair changed colors.</TE>
<TE>   What makes a good pin?</TE>
<TE>   "The artwork has a lot to do with it," said Dan Baker, who has
attended all but two Olympics since Lake Placid in 1980. "Of course,
rarity. And something that's fun."</TE>

<HD>A Tie Can Work for U.S. and Russia</HD>
<DH>A 2-2 draw in rematch of 1980 'miracle game' is
anticlimactic, but it keeps the teams tied in round-robin play.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Eight days after the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team lit the flame to
begin the Salt Lake City Games, the U.S. and Russia met at the E
Center and rekindled memories of the "Miracle on Ice."</LD>
<LD>   It doesn't take much to set off a storyline in these Olympics, and
the first time the U.S. was host of an Olympic game against the core
of the former Soviet Union had people talking--and hawking
tickets--all over town.</LD>
<LD>   It might have been too much to expect another uplifting moment,
another defining sports event, another miracle.</LD>
<TE>   Or even a winner and loser.</TE>
<TE>   For this night, an excellent hockey game at the rollicking,
sold-out E Center would have to suffice.</TE>
<TE>   The result, a 2-2 tie, at least allowed the United States to
continue a 21-game unbeaten streak (18-0-3) in Olympic games on U.S.
land that dates to the 1932 Games in Lake Placid.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and Russia also are tied in Pool D play with a
1-0-1 record. The winner of the four-team pool will have a No. 1
seeding in the playoff round.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why people are still coming back to that 1980,"
Russian forward Alexei Kovalev said. "It's in the past. It's been
along time ago. We can't live what happened in the past, we have to
live what happens in the present time ... today was a pretty exciting
game."</TE>
<TE>   The United States trailed by a goal and had been outshot by almost
20 shots early in the third period, but battled back and tied the
score on a goal by Brett Hull with 41/2 minutes left in regulation.
There is no overtime in the Olympics until the playoff round.</TE>
<TE>   Hull's goal set off a flag-waving frenzy at the E Center.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a feeling--like playoffs, but even more so--with the
patriotism and the flags," U.S. defenseman Chris Chelios said. "It's
touching to see. Hopefully we can give the fans something to cheer
about like we did the first two games."</TE>
<TE>   The overwhelmingly pro-U.S. crowd included 1980 gold medalist Mike
Eruzione and 2002 bronze medalists Chris Klug (snowboard) and Timothy
Goebel (figure skating). A few Russian fans (including pairs figure
skater Elena Berezhnaya) were mixed in. Both sides were cheering
throughout the night.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a little bit different brand of hockey," U.S. goalie Mike
Richter said of the international rules. "You're going to see a lot
of quality shots, and the scoring opportunities are going to be
quality opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   Richter turned back enough of those quality shots to record 33
saves. Russia's Nikolai Khabibulin had 23 saves.</TE>
<TE>   The United States scored first during a two-man advantage in the
second period. A Brian Leetch shot bounced off two defenders and
toward the front of the net, where Keith Tkachuk popped it in.
(Tkachuk would later limp off the ice near the end of the third
period with what was initially described as a bruised thigh.)</TE>
<TE>   The Russians dominated during the rest of the second period and
tied the score on a power-play goal by Valeri Bure with less than
three minutes remaining. They outshot the Americans, 17-4, in the
second.</TE>
<TE>   Russia took the lead two minutes into the third period. Ilya
Kovalchuk, the talented rookie with the Atlanta Thrashers took a
couple of whacks from just outside the crease, then Sergei Fedorov of
the Detroit Red Wings finally got the puck past Richter.</TE>
<TE>   Richter, the New York Rangers' goalie, got the start one night
after Nashville Predator Mike Dunham had a shutout in the opener.</TE>
<TE>   The final result this time was simply a score, not a political
statement or a clash of ideology, as it had been 22 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's just another game," U.S. defenseman Brian Rafalski
said after the U.S. beat Finland to start Olympic play Friday night.
"These guys have been in the NHL, so we're not playing against guys
we don't know.</TE>
<TE>   "They're our allies now, almost. Economic partners, right?"</TE>
<TE>   Too many world events happened.</TE>
<TE>   The rise of Mikhail Gorbachev. Glasnost and  perestroika. The fall
of the Berlin Wall. The breakup of the Soviet Union. The end of the
Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   And, on a sports level, the influx of Eastern European players
into NHL. Some of the players from both sides in Saturday night's
game are teammates during the NHL season, and in another nine days
they'll be teammates again. That didn't mean they treated this game
like a scrimmage or even an NHL game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nerve-racking," U.S. defenseman Brian Leetch said of the
Olympic tension. "It's not like, 'Well we'll get them next week,
they're coming to our place.' Each shift has got that much more
importance."</TE>
<TE>   With a start time of 11:30 p.m. Eastern time, no moments from this
game would be seared in the memories of young children across the
country the way Eruzione's game-winning goal was a generation ago.</TE>
<TE>   Player after player on the current Olympic team, which has 14
players who were 10 or younger in 1980, shared their recollections of
that game and how it inspired them. Current children in the Midwest
and Northeast--the vein of U.S. hockey players--won't even be able to
read about the results of this United States-Russia game in their
morning newspapers. It ended past most deadlines in the Central and
Eastern time zones.</TE>
<TE>   Whose fault was the post-bedtime start time? NBC's?</TE>
<TE>   "We don't make the schedule," NBC Vice President of Communications
Kevin Sullivan said.</TE>
<TE>   That would be the domain of the International Olympic Committee,
the Salt Lake Olympic Committee the International Ice Hockey
Federation and the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan said one benefit of the later start time would be that
the game could be seen in NBC in its entirety, without any cutaways
to other events on the docket earlier Saturday night, such as
short-track speedskating.</TE>
<TE>   A portion of the United States' 6-0 victory over Finland that
aired on NBC from midnight to 1:30 a.m. Eastern time had an overnight
rating of 5.1, which is very good for anything in that time slot (and
great for hockey at any time).</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call earlier in the week, NHL Executive Vice
President and Chief Operating Officer Jon Litner put this spin on the
start time:</TE>
<TE>   "The Saturday night game is in a very attractive 'Saturday Night
Live' time slot, which is always very appealing, particularly for
young adults."</TE>
<TE>   Even if this was a ready for prime time event.</TE>
<TE>   And Lake Placid, 1980, is one chapter of the history book the
Russians would love to skip.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Finland 8, Belarus 1--Teemu Selanne and Olli Jokinen scored two
goals apiece as Finland roared back from a shutout loss to the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Sami Kapanen, Tomi Kallio, Aki Berg and Mikko Eloranta also scored
for Finland, which won the bronze medal in 1998 but is widely
considered the weakest of the six teams that advanced automatically
to the final round.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Nordic combined team's 0-for-23 medal streak could end
today. The fans can feel it, the Americans expect it, and even the
mighty Europeans must sense it.</LD>
<LD>   Proving they're no longer just Todd Lodwick and a bunch of other
guys, the U.S. team soared into third place after the first half of
the team competition Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "We're feeling like we've got a real good chance to do something
special tomorrow," said Lodwick, whose first jump sent a strong
message on the 90-meter hill at Olympic Park.</LD>
<TE>   "I'll be surprised if we're not sliding for a medal tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   The Americans will start today's 20-kilometer cross-country relay
at Soldier Hollow 1 minute 34 seconds behind Finland, by far the best
jumping team at these Olympics. Austria is second, 44 seconds back.</TE>
<TE>   Although the United States has no medals in 23 Nordic combined
events at 19 Olympics, Lodwick virtually predicted one in the team
competition after he took seventh in last week's individual race. It
was the best showing by an American in the sport. Seventh also is the
best U.S. team finish, in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Lodwick was on that team, as well as the 1998 team that struggled
to 10th. But he has never had as much help as this year. Teammate
Bill Demong, who fell in Nagano, had the team's best jump on
Saturday, landing 94.5 meters down the hill and scoring 126 points on
his final attempt.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys have put so much pressure on themselves," U.S. Coach Tom
Steitz said. "We're our own worst enemy, but today every one of them
is going to go home and feel good about themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Lodwick's first jump, scored at 119.5 points by distance and
style, gave the Americans the early lead, but they fell to fourth
after a weak jump by Matt Dayton, who's a much better skier than
jumper. He scored 97.5 before improving by six points on his second
try.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little bit off at the takeoff, and I let one of my skis
drop down a little bit," Dayton said. Johnny Spillane, another U.S.
member, did his part by not making any mistakes. Flag-waving
Americans in the crowd anticipated a big finish from Demong, and he
delivered with a perfect takeoff and landing that helped the U.S.
team leapfrog past Japan and Germany into third.</TE>
<TE>   "We all really decided to let the crowd help us, to enjoy it, to
bask in it," Demong said. "It really worked for us. I knew it was
going to be a different jump, and I felt like I tagged into one."</TE>
<TE>   The Americans are counting on their skiing proficiency to make up
the deficit today, and Dayton could be the key. He had only the
33rd-best jump in the individual competition but moved all the way up
to 18th in the next day's 15K race.</TE>

<HD>Gardner Still in Hospital</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Olympic Greco-Roman wrestling heavyweight champion Rulon Gardner was
listed in fair condition Saturday after surviving a night in subzero
temperatures in Wyoming's backcountry.</LD>
<LD>   Family members said Gardner was being treated for frostbite. It
was unclear how long he would remain hospitalized.</LD>
<LD>   Temperatures Thursday night dipped to 20 degrees below zero in the
Bridger-Teton National Forest, where Gardner got stuck in deep snow
while snowmobiling with three friends.</LD>
<TE>   "Rulon made a lot of smart, smart decisions," said Russell
Gardner, Rulon's older brother during a news conference arranged by
the family in the Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center at Idaho
Falls.</TE>
<TE>   Russell Gardner said his brother kept moving as long as he could,
then dug a shelter for himself beneath some trees.</TE>
<TE>   Near sunrise, he moved to a clearing where a search plane pilot
spotted him early Friday, about 15 miles from his home in Afton, Wyo.</TE>
<TE>   "Rulon loves to live life to the fullest, but lots of prayers were
answered," Russell Gardner said through tears.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner defeated Russia's three-time Olympic Greco-Roman wrestling
champion Alexander Karelin at the 2000 Sydney Games, one of the
sport's greatest upsets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It has been a long time between Olympic hat tricks for the U.S.
men's hockey team--18 years to be precise.</TE>
<TE>   John LeClair's three goals in a 6-0 victory over Finland on Friday
night was the first hat trick for U.S. player since Pat LaFontaine
scored three times in a 7-3 victory over Austria on Feb. 13, 1984.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good start, but the biggest thing was we got a win under
our belts," LeClair said after the United States' opening game of the
tournament. "The guys were really focused, and we need everybody
going."</TE>
<TE>   LeClair was a perfect example.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. didn't win a medal at Nagano in 1998, and LeClair, who
plays for the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL, was scoreless. Against
Finland, LeClair parked himself in his favorite spot in front of the
opposing goalie.</TE>
<TE>   "All his goals, he was right where he's supposed to be,"
defenseman Brian Rafalsky said. "That's his house there, right in
front."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In these days of heightened airport security, figure skaters never
know whether they'll have to part with their precious ice skates when
flying to their next competition.</TE>
<TE>   "It changes from airport to airport," said Robin Wagner, coach of
U.S. medal hopeful Sarah Hughes, who arrived at Salt Lake City on
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "At times, we're not able to take them. This time, we were
begging, and I was explaining that she is an Olympian."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes, who was training at Colorado Springs, was allowed to bring
her skates on board.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner said skaters might begin taking two pair of broken-in boots
and blades with them, just in case one pair doesn't show up at
baggage claim.</TE>
<TE>   When Hughes competed in the Lalique Trophee in November, she had
to check her skates.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't imagine the anxiety when you're watching that carousel
go round and round," Wagner said, "until you see the skates come
out."</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Sports! Events!</LD>
<LD>   Did you know they have sports events here at the Sale-Pelletier
Winter Games?</LD>
<LD>   They have skiing events! Sliding events! Racing events! Shooting
events! Events where participants stop and aim at targets, not French
figure skating judges, from 50 meters.</LD>
<TE>   They have skating events, strange skating events, where the object
is to rush to the finish line, not to judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Where did they come from?</TE>
<TE>   What are they doing here?</TE>
<TE>   Wait a second.</TE>
<TE>   What happened to Ottavio Cinquanta?</TE>
<TE>   Where's our pairs Olympic update?</TE>
<TE>   What is Jamie thinking this minute?</TE>
<TE>   How is David feeling this minute?</TE>
<TE>   If Scott Hamilton falls for the Canadians in the woods, does he
make a sound?</TE>
<TE>   What's that?</TE>
<TE>   "Pairs figure skating press conference in Interview Room A in 15
minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Of course. Right on schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not a criminal," David Pelletier is saying in front of the
usual international media mob, all of them on a first-name basis by
now. "When I stepped out of this room [Friday], I felt like one."</TE>
<TE>   Tell me about it, Dave. The entire Olympic Games have been
handcuffed and locked inside a news conference room for a week. There
have been harsh lights. There have been tough questions. There has
been bread, there has been water, there has been armed security
everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, finally, parole papers were issued. Time to breathe in
the fresh air again. Time to squint into the bright sunlight.</TE>
<TE>   Look, there's a married couple with silver medals. Raphael and Liv
Grete Poiree. Raphael's from France. Liv Grete's from Norway. They
compete for different countries, in the same sport--biathlon. They
have his and hers skis. They have his and hers .22-caliber rifles.
They had second-place finishes in their respective events Saturday,
the men's 12.5-kilometer pursuit and the women's 15-kilometer
individual competition.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, they are not petitioning to upgrade to gold.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere on the biathlon trail, another Norwegian, Ole Einar
Bjoerndalen, is tearing it up. His gold medal in the 12.5-kilometer
pursuit was his third of these Games, making him the first biathlete
ever to win three Olympic gold medals.</TE>
<TE>   He's a prolific Olympic medalist, Bjoerndalen is, although he's
sometimes confused with Bjorn Daehlie, another prolific Olympic
medalist. At the 1998 Nagano Olympics, Bjorn Daehlie competed for
Norway. So did Bjoerndalen. Bjorn Daehlie is a very accomplished
cross-country skier. So is Bjoerndalen.</TE>
<TE>   Bjorn Daehlie won 12 medals during his Olympic career.</TE>
<TE>   Bjoerndalen has won five.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, on his Olympic biography sheet, Bjoerndalen lists
Bjorn Daehlie as one of his sporting idols. He also "gargles with
spirits to keep his body in shape and to ensure good health and keep
away colds" and "enjoys cappuccino for breakfast before a race." Not
sure what Bjorn Daehlie likes for breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   Finishing well behind Bjoerndalen Saturday was American Jay
Hakkinen in 13th place. Before Hakkinen, no American had ever
finished higher than 14th in an individual Olympic biathlon
competition.</TE>
<TE>   "To see that curse broken is a huge achievement," Hakkinen said.</TE>
<TE>   Ah yes, the Famed American Biathlon Curse of 14th Place.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing better," Hakkinen added, "would have been a
medal."</TE>
<TE>   Well, either that or 12th place. Or 11th place. Or 10th place.
Or...</TE>
<TE>   NEWS FLASH!!! IOC says it will award the second pair of pairs gold
medals to Sale and Pelletier Sunday night! NBC says it will find out
how Sale and Pelletier feel about it!</TE>
<TE>   Look at this. It says here that, nine days into the Games, Austria
has one gold medal, Fritz Strobl's in men's downhill. How can that
be? Only one gold medal for the Bronx Bombers of Alpine skiing? How
did this happen? Why weren't we alerted?</TE>
<TE>   As Pelletier was telling us Saturday, we do need to get out more.</TE>
<TE>   NEWS FLASH!!! Another skating controversy at the Salt Lake Ice
Center! This one involving another Canadian! And AN AMERICAN! Paging
Mr. Cinquanta!</TE>
<TE>   Ah, but this is short-track speedskating. Different discipline.
Different rules. No judges around handing out suspect 5.9 scores.</TE>
<TE>   So when a violent four-man collision on the last turn of the men's
1,000-meter final leaves only one man standing ... and that man,
Australian Steve Bradbury, goes from a distant pre-crash fifth place
to easy post-crash winner ... and Chinese skater Li Jiajun is
disqualified for his role in the crash ... and the prohibitive
favorite in the race, American Apolo Anton Ohno, receives stitches
for a deep thigh gash caused by a skate slash, what do these skating
officials do?</TE>
<TE>   Nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Gold medal to Bradbury. Silver to Ohno, who climbed up off the
ice, slipped again and used a desperate hook-slide to edge Canada's
scrambling Mathieu Turcotte to the finish line.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno received his medal after being pushed to the podium in a
wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   That's something Sale and Pelletier didn't do.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the best race of my life," Ohno said. "I skated the way
I wanted to. Unfortunately, I fell in the last corner, but this is
the sport that I live for. I got a silver medal and I cannot complain
about that."</TE>
<TE>   That's another thing Sale and Pelletier didn't do.</TE>

<HD>The Real Miracle Is U.S. Team's Classy Attitude</HD>

<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, UT</DL>
<LD>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah--You want a miracle? This was a miracle.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S men's hockey team played the Russians on Saturday night
for the first time on home ice since the 1980 Lake Placid upset.</LD>
<LD>   And it was the warmest war in town.</LD>
<TE>   The cozy E Center arena rocked with the "USA" chant that first
became popular during that shocker of 22 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Echoed by chants of "Rus-si-ya, Rus-si-ya."</TE>
<TE>   One moment, home fans were singing the name of American goalie
Mike Richter.</TE>
<TE>   The next moment, different voices were singing about the equally
melodic-sounding Valeri Bure.</TE>
<TE>   There were wild cheers and flag waving from the careful start to
the smoldering finish of a 2-2 tie forged by Brett Hull's goal at
15:30 of the third period.</TE>
<TE>   More impressive, though, was what was missing.</TE>
<TE>   The boos.</TE>
<TE>   There were virtually no boos.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody booed the Russians. Nobody booed when they were outshooting
the Americans, 17-4, in the second period. Nobody booed when Sergei
Fedorov gave the Russians the lead early in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   "All the extra-curricular stuff was not a factor," said Mike
Modano, who assisted on Hull's chip shot from the left side. "This
was just a good hockey game against two teams that respect each
other."</TE>
<TE>   The game was the usual style between these longtime brawlers;
physical, flying-into-the-boards, falling-over-the-net hockey.</TE>
<TE>   Blessedly, it was only about that hockey.</TE>
<TE>   It was not about a country, or a curtain, or an empire.</TE>
<TE>   It was "All good," said Alexey Mishin, legendary Russian figure
skating coach who was in the stands.</TE>
<TE>   Mishin said he felt so comfortable, it was actually like just
another hockey game.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight is more like sports, not like enemy," he said. "Before,
we were shooting at each other. Now, we're taking shot glasses and
drinking to each other."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the hospitality was certainly due to the changes in the
world politics over the last two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Iron curtain, lifted, nobody afraid anymore," Mishin said.</TE>
<TE>   Part of it was also due to perhaps a bit of guilt felt by fans who
may have pushed for Friday's scandal-driven awarding of a second gold
medal in pairs figure skating to a Canadian couple. This forced the
winning Russian couple to share the podium despite a lack of hard
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying anything about that," said Mishin.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there is also that fun little fact that there were four
different groups of NHL teammates playing against each other. It must
be hard to hate a guy who may later help you win a Stanley Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all professionals out there," Brian Leetch said. "That is
certainly a difference."</TE>
<TE>   But most of the attitude, one suspects, is due to the U.S. hockey
team itself.</TE>
<TE>   This year America doesn't need a Miracle on Ice. It would be
thrilled with Character on Ice.</TE>
<TE>   Or, maybe, Class on Ice.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday was about the same thing that will follow the U.S. team
throughout the next week.</TE>
<TE>   The need to not to dominate, but just show up and play hard and
act like men.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing 23-10 in shots entering the third period, trailing by a
goal until the final six minutes of the game, the U.S. did just that.</TE>
<TE>   Richter had 33 saves, while Hull scored the only full-strength
goal of the game for the tie.</TE>
<TE>   The wild finish continued a wild streak, as the American men have
not lost an Olympic hockey game in this country in 70 years, a span
of 21 games.</TE>
<TE>   "Desperate times require desperate measures," Modano said. "In the
end, we did what we had to do."</TE>
<TE>   And, for once, they did it with brains, using careful
puck-handling and position to counter a Russian team that played
bigger and faster.</TE>
<TE>   "Four years ago, we didn't have a system, but now we do," Hull
said. "We're more careful out there."</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully, they'll be more careful everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   The last time they got together, in the first NHL-inclusive
Olympics in 1998 in Nagano, the U.S. team reacted to a disappointing
sixth-place finish like children.</TE>
<TE>   The night after their final defeat, a 4-1 loss to eventual
champion Czech Republic, three members of the team trashed three
rooms in the Olympic Village.</TE>
<TE>   You remember now, right? Real class stuff.</TE>
<TE>   Ten chairs were broken, including six that were thrown off a
five-story balcony. Two fire extinguishers were discharged, and
another was thrown into a courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   They caused $3,000 worth of damage, but harmed far worse was their
collective character.</TE>
<TE>   Because they never gave up the name of the culprits.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Chelios, the captain, weakly waited nearly a month before
sending Japanese officials a check and an apology. But no names.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, still no names.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, I asked forward Bill Guerin if one of the three
culprits was him. He wouldn't say either way.</TE>
<TE>   "Nagano was four years ago," he said. "We can put that behind us.
We can put that to bed."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, assistant coach Lou Vairo showed that some of
that foolishness still exists.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't there, I don't know first-hand what happened," he said
of Nagano. "Whatever it was that happened, really it was a minor
detail."</TE>
<TE>   Say what?</TE>
<TE>   "These are good kids, they broke a few chairs," he said. "I bet
half you (media) guys in this room busted a couple of chairs when
your wife shows you the credit card bill at the end of the week."</TE>
<TE>   At that comment, one women reporter openly gasped at the
implication, and Vairo smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "The same goes for women when their husbands bring home the credit
card bill," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Between the second and third periods, the video scoreboard
showed--what else?--an interview with Mike Eruzione.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great opportunity to show how far we've come," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He was talking about hockey. But by the end of Saturday night, he
could have been talking about everything.</TE>

<DH>Seemingly headed for a gold in 1,000, Ohno wipes out and
settles for second. Australia gets first winter gold.</DH>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Apolo Anton Ohno, the 19-year-old from Seattle bidding to win four
medals in short-track speedskating, was denied gold Saturday night in
the first of his four scheduled events, the 1,000 meters, finishing
second after a spectacular crash wiped out all but one skater in the
final turn.</LD>
<LD>   Steven Bradbury of Australia, who had been far back, was the only
racer not involved in the pile-up. While the others tried to pick
themselves up, Bradbury--who would have finished fifth were it not
for the spill--cruised across the finish line to unexpectedly win
gold in 1 minute 29.109 seconds.</LD>
<LD>   Heading into the last turn of the last lap, Ohno had been leading
the pack. But China's Li Jiajun went down, sending South Korea's Ahn
Hyun Soo into Ohno. Canada's Mathieu Turcotte also skidded out.</LD>
<TE>   The crowd's deafening shouts of "U-S-A! U-S-A!" turned to boos and
a roar of disbelief as Bradbury glided across first, still standing,
for Australia's first gold medal in Winter Games history.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno scrambled up and threw himself across the line for the silver
medal in 1:30.160. Turcotte limped in third in 1:30.563.</TE>
<TE>   The crash left Ohno with six stitches on the inside of his left
leg, near his knee, and Turcotte with a painful slice on his
backside.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno arrived at a news conference afterward on crutches and
departed in a wheelchair but said, "I'm OK," and added that he
expected to be ready for his next races Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno said he'd never been involved in such a whopper of a crash,
calling it "definitely unfortunate." But he said he was happy with
silver--"my quest, my journey, was not about four golds"--and added,
"This is short-track. This is the sport I live for."</TE>
<TE>   Bradbury, meantime, a 28-year-old from Brisbane who runs a
boot-making company--the firm makes Ohno's skates--seemed dazed at
his good fortune, which will provide a huge boost for Australia's
burgeoning Olympic winter sports program. Crossing the finish line,
he said afterward, "I was like, 'Hang on, this can't be right. I
think I won.'"</TE>
<TE>   On Friday night, Bradbury said, he had sent Ohno an e-mail asking
for a mention of his company if Ohno won a medal. A survivor who
recovered from a broken neck in September 2000, as well as a 1994
short-track crash that gave him 111 stitches, he said that winning
Olympic gold was a "surreal feeling."</TE>
<TE>   In other racing Saturday at the Salt Lake Ice Center, Yang Yang
(A) of China, the overall gold medalist at the last five world
championships, dominated the women's 500, winning in 44.187 seconds.
The gold is China's first in the Winter Games as well. "It's been our
dream for the past two generations," she said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Evgenia Radanova of Bulgaria took silver, China's Wang Chunlu
bronze. Caroline Hallisey, 21, of Natick, Mass., finished fifth; Amy
Peterson, who carried the U.S. flag into Rice-Eccles Stadium during
the opening ceremony, was eliminated in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Two Chinese short-track skaters in these Games are named Yang
Yang. To tell them apart, officials call one Yang Yang (A) and the
other Yang Yang (S). Yang Yang (A) was born in August, thus the A;
Yang Yang (S) was born in September.</TE>
<TE>   A slew of Olympic records were set Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   The women's 500-meter mark was broken three times. Beginning the
night, it stood at 44.991, set at the 1998 Nagano Games by Isabelle
Charest of Canada. By the end, Yang Yang (A) held the mark, at
44.118, set in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   In the men's 1,000 quarterfinals, Turcotte lowered the mark--set
Wednesday by Rusty Smith of Sunset Beach--from 1:28.183 to 1:27.185.</TE>
<TE>   Also, in qualifying for the women's 3,000-meter relay, South Korea
lowered its record to 4:14.977 from 4:16.260. The record in the
27-lap event had been set in Nagano. The U.S. team was slowed by
Hallisey's fall and failed to make Wednesday's finals.</TE>
<TE>   No American man has won a short-track gold medal since it became
an Olympic sport, in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno, however, has long been expected to become one of the biggest
stars of the U.S. team, a medal contender in all four of his
events--the 1,000 meters, 500 meters, 1,500 meters and 5,000-meter
relay.</TE>
<TE>   He was, for instance, the Sports Illustrated Winter Games preview
edition cover guy--resplendent in his skin-tight racing suit,
sporting a bristly soul patch under his lip.</TE>
<TE>   But he has also endured controversy--the most recent episode
stemming from allegations by another skater that he conspired to fix
a race at the national trials so a close friend would also make the
Olympic team.</TE>
<TE>   An arbitrator ruled there wasn't evidence to support the claim,
and his accuser withdrew the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "That's more than a million miles behind us," Ohno had said
Wednesday, after Olympic racing had begun.</TE>
<TE>   The record he had set Wednesday did Smith little good Saturday. In
the quarterfinals--four groups of four racers--Smith was paired with
Mark McNee of Australia, Li of China (the Nagano 1,000 silver
medalist) and South Korea's Kim Dong Sung (the Nagano 1,000 gold
medalist).</TE>
<TE>   The top two skaters in each heat advanced. Kim and Li got through.
Smith finished third. McNee slipped and fell.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, Ohno had a relatively easy draw.</TE>
<TE>   Kim, Li and Turcotte were all in the other semifinal. All three
fell. Turcotte, however, was put through to the final with judges
ruling that his fall was someone else's fault.</TE>
<TE>   In Ohno's semifinal bracket, he cruised to an easy win, 1:27.48.</TE>
<TE>   And in the finals, he appeared headed for gold--until the final
turn. Ohno said he recalled feeling the breeze in his fingers as he
sailed around the corner, then, "the next thing I knew I was in the
boards."</TE>
<TE>   A moment later, he said, "Maybe next time I'll be a little bit
farther in front."</TE>

<HD>A Happy Return for Van Velde</HD>
<DH>Dutchman, who retired in 1998, surprises field with world
record in 1,000 meters. American Cheek gets bronze.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KEARNS, Utah</DL>
<LD>Fortunately for Dutch sprinter Gerard van Velde, countryman Rintje
Ritsma, a three-medal Olympian, talked him into giving speedskating
another try.</LD>
<LD>   Otherwise, Van Velde would have been selling cars back home in
Holland and somebody else would have won the gold medal Saturday in
the men's 1,000-meter race at the Utah Olympic Oval.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe it would have been Jan Bos, another Dutchman, who finished
second in this race four years ago at Nagano. Maybe it would have
been Jeremy Wotherspoon, the Canadian favorite. Maybe it would have
been one of the Americans, Casey FitzRandolph, who'd won the 500 last
Tuesday, or Kip Carpenter. Maybe even Joey Cheek, the former inline
roller skater from Greensboro, N.C.</LD>
<TE>   But Van Velde was here to skate--"He skated the race of his life,"
Bos said--and all the others had to settle for something other than
gold.</TE>
<TE>   Skating early in the fast group, Van Velde uncorked a world-record
time of 1 minute 7.18 seconds, then watched as, two by two, all the
supposedly faster skaters took shots at it.</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter's first 200 meters weren't fast enough, although he
skated the fastest 1,000 of his life.</TE>
<TE>   FitzRandolph, paired with Bos, had a great start, 16.09 seconds,
fastest of the day, and was flying at a world-record pace after 600
meters, then bobbled on an inner turn. Bos went on to win their race
but couldn't beat his teammate's time.</TE>
<TE>   Cheek too went out at a record pace and, although he couldn't
sustain it, skated his fastest 1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian Mike Ireland and Norwegian Adne Sondral skated ordinary
times, Ireland touching the ice, and finally it was down to Erben
Wennemars, another Dutchman, and Wotherspoon, the World Cup leader
who began the day as the world-record holder.</TE>
<TE>   Wotherspoon, however, is having a Dan Jansen-like Olympics. He
fell at the start of Tuesday's race, and Saturday, after tying
FitzRandolph's quick opener, got too far forward and nearly fell
again.</TE>
<TE>   So when it was over, it was a surprised Van Velde atop the podium.
Bos took second, as he had at Nagano, and Cheek gave the U.S. men
their fourth medal of these Games, the bronze.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been on the podium," Van Velde said, awe in his voice.
"I'm always fourth."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, he was fourth in the 500.</TE>
<TE>   "I missed by 2/100ths of a second," he said. "I was really
disappointed Tuesday."</TE>
<TE>   Van Velde has been disappointed before. Fourth in the 1,000 and
fifth in the 500 in 1992 at Albertville, he was so disappointed in
1998, when he couldn't adjust to the new clapskates, that he quit
speedskating and took a job as a car salesman, missing the Nagano
Games.</TE>
<TE>   "I did some marathon skating too [a form of racing popular in
Holland] but marathon is not good for a sprinter," he said. "I was
always hurting. So for about a year and a half, I quit. Then at the
end of '99 Rintje Ritsma asked me to skate for his team. 'You're
talented, just try it again,' he said. So I tried it."</TE>
<TE>   Succeeded too.</TE>
<TE>   "This season was going very well but now, now this is incredible,"
he said. "I just wanted a medal. I wasn't thinking about winning, I
just didn't want to be fourth again. I'm 30 [31, actually] and I
thought this might be my last Olympic race so I skated it [as if it
was]. When I crossed the finish line, I had the feeling I did
everything I could.</TE>
<TE>   "While I was skating, I didn't think my race was very special. I
never had any feeling I was going very fast. I said, 'Just keep
skating,' and at the finish line I saw my time and it was incredible.
I knew it would be tough to beat."</TE>
<TE>   Impossible, on this day at least.</TE>

<LD>Fans entering the curling venue were startled recently when they were
welcomed by the booming voice of Sylvester Stallone.</LD>
<LD>   Rocky curls? Who'd have guessed?</LD>
<LD>   According to the Salt Lake Tribune, he is one of the voices hired
by the Salt Lake Olympic folks to provide interesting narration for
the Games.</LD>
<TE>   There are Kobe Bryant and Rick Fox, Jay Leno and Britney Spears,
Kevin Bacon and Courtney Cox. And, of course, what would be a Utah
Olympics without the voices of Steve Young and Donny Osmond.</TE>
<TE>   One famous television doctor says, "Hi, I'm Anthony Edwards. Be
careful where you step. It's slippery out there, and we don't need
you to go to the 'E.R.' at these Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Michael Buffer saying, "Let's get ready to play
hockeeeeeey."</TE>
<TE>   Guess the "rumble" part would have cost too much.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No Stuffed Shirts</TE>
<TE>   Before each game Finland's women's hockey team plays, a stuffed
lion is placed behind the bench.</TE>
<TE>   His name is Vili, and he even has his own team sweater.</TE>
<TE>   Vili has been with the team since it played the World
Championships in Minnesota last year, courtesy of an unidentified
local man of Finnish descent who adopted the team for a short while,
touring the players around.</TE>
<TE>   "One day he's like, 'You guys don't have any mascots here. OK,
let's go, I'm going to buy you one,'" Finland goalie Tuula Puputti
said. "They found this lion, and that's how he became our mascot."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We Hardly Knew You</TE>
<TE>   Puerto Rico's Olympics lasted about as long as winter in San Juan.</TE>
<TE>   The delegation's lone entry, the two-man bobsled team, was forced
to drop out Saturday hours before the event when one competitor was
declared ineligible--by the island's rules. Michael Gonzales could
prove he has lived on the island for two years and one month. That
failed the team's three-year rule.</TE>
<TE>   "We know he has the three years, but we need the proof," said
Pedro Cardona, president of Puerto Rico's Olympic committee said.
"Without it, we authorize nothing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Going Offline</TE>
<TE>   Joey Cheek, the surprise bronze medalist in the men's 1,000-meter
speedskating race, is another in what is becoming a long line of
former inline roller skaters making a successful transition to ice.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Parra, a former inline champion, already has won a silver
medal for the U.S. and Jennifer Rodriguez, who finished seventh in
the women's 3,000, is a contender in today's women's 1,000.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first put on ice skates, it was just to do something
different," Cheek said. "But once I tried it, I really loved it. Once
I got on ice skates, the Olympics became my goal."</TE>
<TE>   So six years ago, at 16, he left home in Greensboro, N.C., and
moved to Calgary, where he stayed with a host family while learning
the intricacies of his sport on what then was the fastest ice
available.</TE>
<TE>   His reaction to his medal?</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't had a good 1,000-meter race since December 2001 but I
didn't want to give up and I kept fighting. I was so pumped. It's so
beautiful! It's incredible! It's beyond expectations and I am close
to being speechless."</TE>
<TE>   Cheek then went on talking for about half an hour.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tough Crowd</TE>
<TE>   Daron Rahlves discovered it's not easy living up to expectations
when the Olympics are in your country.</TE>
<TE>   Norwegian star Kjetil Andre Aamodt says he discovered the same
thing when his country played host to the 1994 Lillehammer Games.</TE>
<TE>   Aamodt won three medals in those Olympics, yet none was the color
Norway had in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my most difficult championship in terms of pressure,"
Aamodt said after winning the men's super-giant slalom, his second
gold medal of these Olympics. "I had two silvers and a bronze and
people were disappointed in me. I was pretty pleased. It was really
hard, especially in slalom. I was second after the first run and
slipped in the second gate.</TE>
<TE>   "Life goes on.... It's part of the game. All sports events become
history pretty fast. You enjoy the moment, try to win or lose with
the same smile, but it's not always easy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fast Times</TE>
<TE>   U.S. figure skater Michelle Kwan, who has alternated between
staying in the athletes' village and in an apartment with her parents
since the opening ceremony in Salt Lake City, went to see the U.S.
men's hockey team beat Finland Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "It was awesome," she said. "I had a great time.... I've been able
to see some speedskating and meet Apolo [Anton] Ohno, and I met the
rest of the gang."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Agenda Isn't So Hidden</TE>
<TE>   Kwan and fellow U.S. figure skater Sasha Cohen said that they
agreed with the International Olympic Committee's decision to award
duplicate gold medals to Canadian pairs skaters Jamie Sale and David
Pelletier, who lost a close decision to Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze of Russia on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice they can both have gold medals," Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   "Too bad they can't do that for all the events."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Easy Does It</TE>
<TE>   Pelletier had a few words on what he had planned to do before
learning he and Sale would get a gold medal:</TE>
<TE>   "We had a few things planned for the day. Obviously not this. I
felt like going for a skeleton ride without a helmet on. Now, I will
put a helmet on."</TE>
<TE>   On what he thought when he was told he and Sale would get a gold
medal:</TE>
<TE>   "We don't really know what happened. We watched Mr. [Jacques]
Rogge and Mr. [Ottavio] Cinquanta say we had a gold medal and after
that I sort of stopped listening."</TE>
<TE>   On whether he and Sale had worn their silver medals and knew if
they had to surrender those medals when they got the gold:</TE>
<TE>   "I do hope we get the bronze, too, so we get the entire
collection."</TE>

<HD>Aamodt Proves a Wiz in Super-G</HD>
<DH>Norwegian cements status with second gold of Games and
seventh Olympic medal. Rahlves is a disappointing eighth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SNOWBASIN, Utah</DL>
<LD>Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway has always been on top of the list--you
can't beat that last name in rankings of alphabetical order--yet he
somehow continues his vertical ascent up his sport's all-time chair
lift.</LD>
<LD>   After collecting his second gold medal in Salt Lake City by
winning Saturday's super-giant slalom at Snowbasin, a discipline he
hasn't won in six years, Aamodt has schussed from one of the best
skiers of all time to maybe the best.</LD>
<LD>   It is as tough to quantify these things in ski racing as it is in
American football--Unitas or Montana? Still, Aamodt is presenting a
strong enough case to take before Judge Mills Lane.</LD>
<TE>   Aamodt or Jean-Claude Killy?</TE>
<TE>   Aamodt or Toni Sailer?</TE>
<TE>   Aamodt or Alberto Tomba?</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, Aamodt joined these legends when he became the fourth
man to win three Olympic gold Alpine medals.</TE>
<TE>   "To win all those medals, it's something you don't plan to do,"
Aamodt said. "Just happens."</TE>
<TE>   It says something when a guy can enter an Olympic event on the
relative sly and win the thing, and that's what Aamodt did under a
brilliant blue Utah sky.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did he beat a blue-ribbon field with his winning time of
1 minute 21.58 seconds, he did it on maybe the most treacherous
Olympic super-G ever designed and did it against the Austrians, who
finished second, third, fourth and seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Stephan Eberharter, the favorite, will be kicking himself all the
way back to his hometown of Stumm after making a mistake near the end
and finishing a tenth of a second behind at 1:21.68. Andreas
Schifferer won the bronze with a time of 1:21.83.</TE>
<TE>   Aamodt also did it against American hopeful Daron Rahlves, the
reigning super-G world champion, who should have carved ice circles
around the Norwegian.</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves instead ended up a distant eighth, .90 behind the winner
and only one spot higher than unsung teammate Thomas Vonn, who skied
his bib off and finished ninth from the 33rd start position.</TE>
<TE>   How disappointed was Rahlves?</TE>
<TE>   "You could say, 'very,'" the 28-year-old said.</TE>
<TE>   Aamodt said Wednesday's win in combined meant more to him because
it was his first Olympic gold since the 1992 Albertville Games and
his sixth medal overall, more than any racer in Olympic Alpine
skiing.</TE>
<TE>   However, the really big Austrian guns, Eberharter and Fritz
Strobl, don't ski the combined, which some could argue diminishes
Aamodt's combined effort.</TE>
<TE>   In the super-G, though, Aamodt tamed the very best. Eberharter has
won three of the four World Cup super-Gs raced this year.</TE>
<TE>   Aamodt's victory earned him his seventh Olympic medal, adding to
his record, and his 17th medal in Olympic or world championship
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Aamodt, 30, took Saturday's race with a clever mix of brain and
brawn. The course, set by Team Switzerland, was brutal, especially
down the final pitch. Unlike the downhill, racers don't get practice
runs in super-G. They are allowed only to inspect the course
visually.</TE>
<TE>   Aamodt obviously did his homework, as four of the first 12 racers
were disqualified after failing to make the gate right after a blind,
final descent over Buffalo Jump.</TE>
<TE>   Aamodt, skiing third, took the appropriate line and put up a time
no one could match.</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter, skiing seventh, made the critical gate, but carried
too much speed and had to hit the brakes on the next two gates.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost the gold with that stupid mistake," said Eberharter, who
adds silver to the bronze he won in the downhill.</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter also offered an earful about not getting the proper
course report from his coaches, saying "I should have gotten more
information about what would happen to me on the last, steep slope."</TE>
<TE>   Aamodt said it's all about knowing the course.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I have a lot of experience," Aamodt said. "I normally
inspect the course quite well. I had no problem with the last pitch.
That's part of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, it seemed the man most uncomfortable with assessing his
place in history was ... Aamodt.</TE>
<TE>   He says he does not yet belong in the same class with such skiers
as Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark and Italy's Tomba.</TE>
<TE>   "I still feel I have a lot to prove," Aamodt said. "Stenmark, he
won 86 World Cup victories, Tomba won 50, and so far I've won 20
victories. That's where you see where the best skiers are, when you
constantly ski well on the World Cup tour."</TE>
<TE>   Aamodt failed to note that Stenmark and Tomba were strictly slalom
racers, and that Aamodt would no doubt have far more World Cup
victories had he concentrated on one or two events instead of four.</TE>
<TE>   Aamodt also noted that he has had the rare chance to compete in
four Olympics dating to Albertville.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not always that great to compare with Olympics before
because it always changed," he said. "It was three events before
[super-G was added]. It's not fair to all champions."</TE>
<TE>   No Americans were left assessing their place in history.</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves was crushed by his performance, in which he skied
tentatively and had to live with the result.</TE>
<TE>   "To walk away from Salt Lake with no medals," he said, "that's
definitely not what I ... "</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves stopped to collect himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked hard this summer," he continued. "I thought I was on the
right plan, the right track, coming in right where I wanted to be. I
didn't make it happen today."</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves wasn't even the fastest American in the downhill,
finishing 16th to teammate Marco Sullivan's ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, Rahlves nearly was passed by another young American,
Vonn, nicknamed "the Vonnerator."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a medal, but it feels like it for me," said the
26-year-old from Newburgh, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Vonn said he felt for Rahlves.</TE>
<TE>   "Daron's been under a tremendous amount of pressure," Vonn said.
"He's the poster boy. He's the guy marked to do it all, it's a lot of
weight to carry. I know he's skiing well, he's just probably trying
too hard. He's a good enough skier to be getting gold medals."</TE>

<HD>Nancy, Tonya Forever Linked</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nancy Kerrigan is the mother of 5-year-old Matthew, a wife to Jerry
Solomon, a happy skater in on-ice productions of "Grease" and
"Footloose" and honored by iParenting.com as a wonderful example of a
working mother.</LD>
<LD>   Tonya Harding was evicted from her house two weeks ago and she
told a judge at her eviction hearing that "unfortunately, me and my
dog are going to sleep in a Corvette roadster." Two years before
that, Harding was in court answering charges after she threw a hubcap
at the knees of her live-in boyfriend at the time.</LD>
<LD>   They are still opposites, Nancy and Tonya, always to be linked by
one ugly act.</LD>
<TE>   Two days before the start of the 1994 U.S. championships, which
served as the Olympic figure skating trials, Kerrigan was attacked by
a man who clubbed her in the knee then fled by smashing through a
window at the practice facility in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out the attack had been carried out by some of the
less-upstanding acquaintances of Harding's husband at the time, Jeff
Gillooly. The attackers claimed Harding hatched the plot. Harding
said she was coerced into going along with Gillooly and his mates who
wanted to make sure Kerrigan was disabled for the 1994 Lillehammer
Olympics, giving Harding a clearer shot at a medal and the great
riches they were sure would follow.</TE>
<TE>   The Tonya-Nancy story enveloped those Games and helped make figure
skating an even more popular sport. After some legal maneuvering,
Harding, who had won the Olympic trial in Kerrigan's absence, was
allowed on the U.S. team with Kerrigan, who had been given the second
U.S. spot and who had spent six weeks rehabbing her badly bruised
knee.</TE>
<TE>   Every U.S. practice, with Harding and Kerrigan on the ice
together, was a zoo.</TE>
<TE>   Harding caused a break in the long program when she stopped
skating seconds into her routine and burst into tears because her
skate lace broke.</TE>
<TE>   Kerrigan, meanwhile, skated the two best programs of her life only
to finish second in a controversial decision that gave the gold to
Ukraine's Oksana Baiul.</TE>
<TE>   Harding, a two-time U.S. champion, ended up doing community
service for her role in covering up the Kerrigan attack. And her life
has been nothing but scandal since 1994. She spent three days in jail
for the attack on her boyfriend. She has recently been a contestant
on the TV show "The Weakest Link," with other notorious celebrity
contestants such as Gennifer Flowers, Darva Conger and Kato Kaelin.</TE>
<TE>   She tried skating in one pro-am competition in West Virginia, but
the lifetime ban the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. handed down after the
Kerrigan attack kept her from pursuing her skating career in most of
the lucrative pro-ams, many of which exist because of the attention
Harding brought to the sport.</TE>
<TE>   Kerrigan, meanwhile, married Solomon, who was her agent in
Lillehammer. Kerrigan, too, received some bad publicity when she was
seen as an unhappy silver medalist and especially when, as a guest at
Disneyland shortly after her performance, Kerrigan was caught saying
that "This was the corniest thing I ever did," while sitting next to
Mickey Mouse.</TE>
<TE>   She has, however, settled quietly into a Massachusetts home with
Solomon and their son. She actively works for charities, especially
those affiliated with blindness because her mother is blind.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Women Continue to Roll</HD>
<DH>Young players keep their cool in 5-0 victory over Finland.
Effort includes hat trick by Darwitz and 21 saves by DeCosta.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>The American kids are taking over. At this rate the United States
women's hockey squad will be known as Teen USA.</LD>
<LD>   Natalie Darwitz, 18, had a hat trick Saturday in the United
States' 5-0 victory over Finland.</LD>
<LD>   She's part of a brigade of young players making a name for
themselves , including fast-talking, fast-moving forward Julie Chu,
19, solid defenseman Lyndsay Wall, 16, and Krissy Wendell, a magician
with the puck who turned 20 in September.</LD>
<TE>   "They're fantastic," said teammate A.J. Mleczko, 27. "It's
phenomenal. I guess amazing is a good word. Every once in a while,
you step back and you think how young they are. That makes you kind
of appreciate where they are. I hate to put pressure on them, but I
expect miracles out of them."</TE>
<TE>   Will she settle for impressive if she can't get miraculous?
Darwitz leads the team with six goals in three games. Wendell has
three assists and a goal and Chu has two goals and two assists.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time the U.S. played Finland since the 2001 World
Championships. Finland put up the best fight the Americans have seen
here, and even outshot the U.S. for the first half of the opening
period.</TE>
<TE>   But the Finns were more impressed by the overall skill level of
the U.S. team than ever before.</TE>
<TE>   "They were not this good last year," said Finland forward Hanne
Sikio. "I think they're much better."</TE>
<TE>   Part of that can be attributed to the emergence of the young
players. But don't forget about the 14 returning members of the 1998
gold-medal team. On Thursday, Cammi Granato had a hat trick against
China. Saturday it was goaltender Sara DeCosta. She made 21 saves to
record her second shutout of these Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   DeCosta was at her best when she made three saves during a two-man
advantage for Finland in the first period.</TE>
<TE>   DeCosta even picked up an assist off another penalty-killing save
in the first. The long rebound came out to Angela Ruggiero, who had
just stepped out of the penalty box. Ruggiero zipped down the ice,
but was upended by Finland's Emma Laaksonen. Darwitz was right there
to shoot the puck and score her second goal.</TE>
<TE>   Darwitz seemed to be everywhere on Saturday. It was impossible not
to notice her, even though she's only 5 feet 2.</TE>
<TE>   "People say I'm young and I'm small," Darwitz said. "But I've been
on this team for three years now. Size doesn't have a lot to do with
the women's game. I just go hard and use my speed."</TE>
<TE>   Her hockey's so advanced, she probably needs more assistance with
her high school correspondence courses than her game. That's when it
helps to have so many Ivy Leaguers on the team.</TE>
<TE>   "If I have questions, I go to the Harvard kids and say, 'Help me
out here,'" Darwitz said.</TE>
<TE>   It's a nice blend, on and off the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the best thing about our team is the balance between the
veterans and the rookies," said Chu.</TE>
<TE>   "The veterans bring a maturity and experience to our game that's
beyond any of our imagination. They bring a lot of control. The
younger kids bring a high level of skill, along with the eager
enthusiasm with it being our first time out there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Germany 5, China 5--Michaela Lanzl had two goals, as Germany
scored three straight third-period goals to tie China. The tie gave
Germany (0-2-1) the third seed in Group B--and a matchup with winless
Kazakhstan. China will face Russia (1-2) for a chance to play in the
fifth-place game. Both teams are out of medal contention.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Canada 11, Sweden 0--Jennifer Botterill scored twice, and Jayna
Hefford had a goal and three assists to lead Canada into the medal
round with a shutout of Sweden. Canada will play Finland and Sweden
will play the U.S. in the semifinals Tuesday. That sets up a
potential gold-medal matchup Thursday between the Americans and
Canadians.</TE>

<HD>Dispute May Affect Vote on Police Bond</HD>
<DH>Politics: Some see discord between Hahn and Parks as
obstacle for a measure to replace aging stations across Los Angeles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having twice failed in recent years to win approval of police bond
measures, Los Angeles city leaders face the added challenge this year
of overcoming the public discord over Mayor James K. Hahn's decision
not to back Police Chief Bernard Parks for another term.</LD>
<LD>   Some political strategists see the Hahn-Parks dispute as a major
obstacle to winning passage of the $600-million police bond measure
March 5.</LD>
<LD>   "The timing is not good," said Harvey Englander, a veteran
political consultant not affiliated with campaigns for or against the
measure. "There is so much uncertainty about the leadership of the
department, and uncertainty is the first step toward voting no."</LD>
<TE>   Political strategist Arnie Steinberg agreed. "On any bond measure,
people are looking for a way out, and this gives them a chance to
hesitate."</TE>
<TE>   Proposition Q campaign manager Steve Afriat discounts that theory,
noting that despite their differences over the chief's tenure, Parks
and Hahn both signed the ballot argument in favor of the bonds and
have agreed to campaign for the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Both men are scheduled to attend the campaign kickoff event
Thursday at the West Valley police station, one of the old and
cramped facilities that would be replaced under the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by a two-thirds vote, the measure would authorize the
city to issue $600 million in bonds to pay for a new combined
emergency operations/fire dispatch center downtown, as well as
replacement of the West Valley, Hollenbeck, Rampart and Harbor police
stations.</TE>
<TE>   The measure also would finance new stations in the San Fernando
Valley and Mid-Wilshire areas, replace the metropolitan jail, and
build two new bomb squad facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The average tax for the owner of a $185,900 home would be $34.49
per year for 24 years.</TE>
<TE>   City Council President Alex Padilla, a co-chairman of the $400,000
campaign in favor of the bond measure, said the public understands
the need to upgrade aging facilities that hamper police work.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very bad in stations in all the areas of the city," Padilla
said.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Officer Gretchen Zavala can vouch for the condition of the
West Valley station.</TE>
<TE>   The veteran officer, assigned to a property disposition detail,
shares a former janitor's closet with two co-workers--their desks and
chairs filling the 5-by-10-foot room.</TE>
<TE>   "It's stuffy, and every time someone wants to get by, I have to
move my chair in," Zavala said.</TE>
<TE>   Other officers and detectives at the station work in a former
locker room and in trailers.</TE>
<TE>   The station was built in 1960 to accommodate 92 workers, but it
currently houses 315 officers and civilians, according to Capt. James
H. Cansler, commanding officer of the station.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to keep morale up. Look at the terrible conditions
you have," Cansler said, pointing to exposed wires snaking all over
rooms packed with desks. The main detective office has 19 people in a
room built for five.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be hard to hear a victim on the phone when you have
everyone talking at the same time," said Det. Bruno Pabon, whose desk
is pushed up against another.</TE>
<TE>   The poor condition isn't the main reason the station was picked as
the site to kick off the campaign. City leaders know that if they are
going to win approval of the bond measure, they have to win over
voters in the Valley, which was instrumental in the defeat of two
previous police bond measures.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, the voters in the Valley are critical in determining
whether this bond measure passes," said Padilla, a Pacoima resident.</TE>
<TE>   The organized campaign to defeat Proposition Q is being chaired by
Richard Close, who is also chairman of the secession group Valley
VOTE, and secessionist leaders make up most of the board of the No on
Prop. Q Committee. The campaign committee also includes Jon Coupal,
president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Close said it is inappropriate for the city to take on new debt
during an economic downturn and before a proposed ballot measure in
November that could decide whether Los Angeles is split into four
smaller cities.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla disagreed. "Given the [terrorist] incident of last year,
the public recognizes that we can't wait."</TE>
<TE>   Close also cited broken promises of past bond measures, including
a 1989 bond measure that called for new Valley and Mid-Wilshire
stations. The site of the new Valley station has been purchased and
prepared for construction.</TE>
<TE>   "The main argument is we need more police officers and
firefighters and paramedics, not more buildings," Close said.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla responded, "We need both, and we can't pay for police
officers with bonds."</TE>
<TE>   City leaders hope newfound admiration for public safety workers
following the Sept. 11 attacks will help them carry the day.</TE>
<TE>   But Englander predicted that the bonds will fail.</TE>
<TE>   The active opposition of Valley secessionists will hurt, he said.
He also noted that the Republican gubernatorial primary will be
contentious, drawing voters who are more conservative and less
supportive of bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The city might be able to overcome all of those issues if it could
raise $1 million for a campaign, Englander said, but it would still
be a hard sell given the strain between Parks and Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   "The Police Department is in the headlines for the wrong reasons,"
he said. "My gut feeling is it's going to be another loss."</TE>
<TE>   Padilla predicted victory.</TE>
<TE>   "The public in general understands and prioritizes public safety
as No. 1. With this bond measure, we are giving the men and women who
we count on to keep us safe the tools and facilities they need to do
the best job they can."</TE>

<DH>Politics: Prosecutor Wallace Wade wants boss Tony
Rackauckas' job in a match billed as one of the nastiest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his 23 years as an Orange County prosecutor, Bill Feccia has seen
elections come and go, along with the ever-changing tides of office
politics.</LD>
<LD>   But this year's campaign for district attorney is different. This
time, things are getting personal.</LD>
<LD>   Veteran prosecutor Wallace Wade is challenging his boss, Dist.
Atty. Tony Rackauckas, in a campaign that's led to shouting matches
at union meetings, a lawsuit and accusations of computer
eavesdropping and stolen garbage.</LD>
<TE>   It's a campaign some veterans are calling the nastiest in the
history of the office, a campaign that's turned friends against each
other and left employees wondering whether they'll face retribution
if their candidate loses.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been losing sleep for a year," said Feccia, an assistant
district attorney and Rackauckas supporter. "I've lost friends over
this, good friends that I've had for years."</TE>
<TE>   Wade's campaign is focused almost exclusively on allegations that
Rackauckas abused his authority for political gain during his first
three years in office. Rackauckas' campaign has raised questions
about Wade's record and whether he has the skills to run the district
attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas beat Wade four years ago by a wide margin, entering
office with broad support from prosecutors in the office as well as
Republican and Democratic party figures. But it didn't take long for
some vocal prosecutors to become disenchanted with Rackauckas, whom
they accuse of putting politics above justice.</TE>
<TE>   The incident that's attracted the most attention is Rackauckas'
involvement in a consumer-protection case involving businessman and
now Ambassador to Spain George Argyros, whose apartment company
donated $1,000 to Rackauckas' 1998 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas ordered prosecutors to withdraw a lawsuit against the
company, accused of unfairly keeping security deposits from thousands
of tenants, and then took over negotiations himself. After critics
faulted his actions, Rackauckas handed the case over to the state
attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   Personnel issues have also attracted attention. Last year,
Rackauckas fired veteran homicide prosecutor Mike Jacobs, one of his
biggest critics. Jacobs said Rackauckas was retaliating against him.
The district attorney also suspended two investigators who questioned
his intervention in a case that involved another of Rackauckas'
campaign contributors. Rackauckas accused the investigators of
stealing office documents but no criminal charges were filed.</TE>
<TE>   Some Staff Join Wade; Some Stick With D.A.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations eventually attracted the attention of an Orange
County Grand Jury committee, which typically drafts reports about the
justice system for the Board of Supervisors. And several of
Rackauckas' top assistants left the office and joined Wade's
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "As prosecutors, there are certain lines we just don't cross and
he's crossed every one of them," said Christopher Evans, a former top
assistant to Rackauckas, who left the office and is supporting Wade.
"There shouldn't be one prosecutor left standing on his side."</TE>
<TE>   But there are. Many in the office say the allegations have been
blown out of proportion, that Rackauckas is a fair prosecutor who's
being attacked by malcontents upset over lost promotions.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to admit, I hold some resentment. I think there's been
some exploitation, bitterness about not getting promotions," said
Feccia, who is backing Rackauckas. "It's turned into an exaggeration,
vitriolic attacks. It's very sad. It makes it very difficult for
many, including myself, to go to work."</TE>
<TE>   Wade did win the endorsement of the county prosecutors
association, which never before had supported a challenger to a
seated district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Still, with only a few weeks before the March 5 election, it
remains unclear whether Wade can raise the money he needs to get his
message to voters. Wade had raised less than half the $200,000
Rackauckas had through the last reporting period.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Schroeder, the former state Republican party leader who's
running Rackauckas' campaign, said he believes Wade's negative
campaign will backfire.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't have any issues at all, other than making false
charges against Tony," Schroeder said. Wade won a significant victory
this month when the prosecutors association agreed, after a debate
that ended up in court, to spend $50,000 promoting Wade's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy [now] has money. He has endorsements. He has issues.
It's a campaign that has real traction," said Fred Smoller, chairman
of the political science department at Chapman University in Orange.
"If I were Rackauckas, I'd be quaking in my boots."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said he has little reason to be concerned. He said he
believes the county's voters will reelect him for making good on his
promises to reduce gang crime, increase child-support collection and
beef up enforcement of environmental-protection laws.</TE>
<TE>   When he took office, Rackauckas killed a longtime ban on
prosecutors participating in plea bargains. During his first three
years, the number of plea bargains in three-strikes cases rose while
the number of repeat offenders sentenced to the maximum 25 years to
life in prison declined significantly.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas supporters said the trends show the district attorney
is taking more care to make sure punishment fits the crime when it
comes to repeat offenders. But Wade believes Rackauckas' policies
violate the three-strikes law, designed to stiffen sentences for
repeat criminals.</TE>
<TE>   Wade said integrity is the main issue in the campaign and that
Rackauckas' controversies will come back to haunt him.</TE>
<TE>   "If people read the newspapers and study the issues, I'll win,"
Wade said. "I'm convinced of that."</TE>
<TE>   Some political consultants said the candidates could be headed for
a photo finish, perhaps with an edge to the incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's probably going to be closer than anyone imagined,"
said Irvine political consultant Scott Hart. "But I think Tony will
win. Wade would have to have something more than these little
improprieties."</TE>

<HD>Governor Seizes On Energy Issue at Convention</HD>
<DH>Politics: The state Democratic Party gathering serves as an
informal launching pad for Davis' reelection campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK and MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After months of keeping a personal distance from his reelection
campaign, Gov. Gray Davis on Saturday stepped into the role of
candidate, seizing the energy issue as a bludgeon to flog his
Republican foes.</LD>
<LD>   Joining a chorus of Enron-bashing at the state Democratic Party
convention, Davis accused his GOP rivals of supporting the kind of
free-market free-for-all he blamed for last year's electricity
crisis.</LD>
<LD>   "Here's a wake-up call: California will return to this disastrous
deregulation scheme over this governor's dead body," Davis
said--drawing a roar for stealing President Bush's tough talk on
preserving federal tax cuts.</LD>
<TE>   Besides serving as the informal launching ground for Davis'
reelection campaign, the gathering of more than 2,500 party faithful
in downtown Los Angeles provided a backdrop for early tryouts by
prospective presidential hopefuls.</TE>
<TE>   On hand were Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota
and Sens. John Edwards of North Carolina and John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts--none openly admitting any ambitions beyond the wish to
see Davis reelected and Democrats prosper in general.</TE>
<TE>   The governor, for his part, didn't rule out his own run for
president, or vice president, should he win a second term in
November.</TE>
<TE>   "All that I can tell you is that I have no plans but to work as
hard as I can to be reelected and to spend the next four years being
governor," Davis told reporters, leaving the door distinctly open to
a possible White House run.</TE>
<TE>   The two-day gathering of the party's most loyal followers comes at
a difficult time for Democrats, as they probe for weakness in a
president enjoying stratospheric support in opinion polls. That is
true even in California, where Bush lost in a landslide in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The result was an odd kind of dissonance between partisan hearts
and pragmatic heads, which was reflected in Kerry's speech and the
crowd's response.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no labels--no Democrats, no Republicans. We are united,
one America, one president, one purpose, to make clear: No terrorist
will steal our way of life in the United States of America," he said,
to polite applause.</TE>
<TE>   But within moments, Kerry turned the events of Sept. 11 to
partisan ends--and drew a far more rousing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   "It is time," he said, "to remind our Republican friends that the
firefighters and the police officers they are so quick to make
speeches about--the ones who climbed those stairs of the World Trade
Center in order to give their lives so that others may live--were all
members of a union, and they all believed in the right of workers to
organize."</TE>
<TE>   Most of Saturday's speakers treated the war on terrorism as a
passing note. There were brief statements of bipartisanship, salutes
to the nation's fighting men and women, and commendations for Bush as
commander-in-chief.</TE>
<TE>   However, there was no hesitation about assailing him on the home
front, with critics picking apart his record on abortion, education,
civil rights and the economy. "Being a good American does not mean we
have to suppress good debate," Daschle said.</TE>
<TE>   A particular focus was the administration's ties to Enron, the
collapsed energy giant.</TE>
<TE>   Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
played off the president's reference in his State of the Union speech
to Iran, Iraq and North Korea as "an axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   "What he didn't talk about is the 'access of evil,'" McAuliffe
said. "The unprecedented access he's given to corporate special
interests."</TE>
<TE>   Others spoke of "Enronomics"--"helping those at the top and
leaving everyone else behind," as Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) put
it--and "Enronizing Social Security," in the words of Daschle, who
promised to fight any effort to privatize the retirement system.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry compared Enron to the fictional mafia clan the
Corleones--with apologies, he said, to the Corleones--and Edwards
said the Enron collapse has contributed to the economic anxiety of
Americans who worry: "Is something like this going to happen to me?"</TE>
<TE>   About the only speaker who failed to utter the word "Enron" from
the podium was Davis, who has come under fire from his Republican
opponents for accepting $119,500 in past campaign contributions from
the firm.</TE>
<TE>   "No one fought Enron harder and more successfully," Davis said at
a news conference, citing his efforts to win price caps and
re-regulate the state's energy market. "I see no reason to give back
any resources. It would be one thing if I did their bidding, but I
was hostile to everything they tried to persuade me to try to do."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' appearance at the convention marked a sort of coming out as
a candidate. Although he has been omnipresent in television
advertising for the past several weeks--and has raised money for
reelection since even before taking office--Davis has shunned most
overt forms of campaigning.</TE>
<TE>   His appearance Saturday began with a videotaped tribute to
himself, featuring testimonials from schoolteachers, firefighters and
the parents of a handicapped child who fought their HMO with the
Davis administration's help.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, the usually buttoned-down governor bounded through the
convention ballroom, shaking hands, hugging and slapping backs as he
worked his way to the stage amid blaring rock music.</TE>
<TE>   "Four years ago, I promised you that California would be stronger,
kinder and better now than it was then," Davis said after the crowd
settled down. "And I have delivered on that promise."</TE>
<TE>   He went on to extol his record on education, environmental
protection, gay rights and health care, drawing repeated ovations.</TE>
<TE>   The response turned to hoots and jeers as he scorned his GOP
opponents, never mentioning them by name.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't govern the fifth-largest economy in the world with
warmed-over platitudes," he said. "You can't lead this state of 34
million people with old ideas and vague generalities. Talk is cheap."</TE>
<TE>   Davis added, "Whichever one of you emerges from the Republican
primary"--Secretary of State Bill Jones, former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan or businessman Bill Simon Jr.--"you're in for the
fight of your life."</TE>

<HD>Campaign Money's on an El Toro Park</HD>
<DH>Land Use: Backers of Measure W greatly outspend their
opponents, who favor a commercial airport.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Less than three weeks before election day, the only aggressive
campaign being waged over the fate of the closed El Toro Marine base
is by opponents of Orange County's plans to build an airport there.</LD>
<LD>   So far, they've sent several mailers countywide urging a vote for
Measure W, the initiative on the March 5 ballot that would rezone the
4,700-acre property for use primarily as a public park.</LD>
<LD>   But what was expected to be a significant counter effort to
convince voters of the benefits of a proposed airport handling 18.8
million passengers a year has not materialized.</LD>
<TE>   No one is more surprised by that than the anti-airport troops.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't heard of them doing anything," said Len Kranser,
spokesman for Citizens for Safe and Healthy Communities, the
anti-airport effort based in south Orange County. "They have some
signs up, but that's it."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County supervisors had pledged to spend $6 million this
fiscal year on mailers and public forums detailing the county's
airport plans. That spending was halted in December when a San Diego
County judge ruled that the mailings violated state law barring
government campaign advocacy.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach had earmarked $3.7 million more to argue for an
alternative to John Wayne Airport, but that spending also was stopped
to settle a similar lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the absence of the airport campaign's chief--and
essentially only--private sector donor, billionaire businessman
George Argyros, who since 1994 has spent nearly $3.5 million on
initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   At this time two years ago, Argyros had given $237,364 to the
campaign to defeat Measure F. That initiative, on the March 2000
ballot, would have mandated voter approval before any new airport,
large jail or hazardous landfill could be built near homes. It passed
with 67% of the vote but was overturned in the courts.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, the committee Argyros has traditionally funded
has not filed any campaign finance reports because it hasn't raised
more than $1,000, according to organizers. The other airport advocacy
group, the Airport Working Group of Orange County, has reported
raising $42,220 through Jan. 22.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-airport "Yes on W" group reported raising $550,000
through Jan. 19. Since then, it said it has hit the $2-million mark
in contributions and pledges.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Nestande, a former county supervisor who has headed Argyros'
pro-airport committee since 1994, said more money has been collected
in the last month, but he declined to reveal how much. The next
required campaign report is due Friday and will include the tally
from a pro-airport fund-raiser held this month at Antonello's
Ristorante in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Airport advocates have been tight-lipped about their fund-raising
efforts. David Ellis, the Airport Working Group's longtime
consultant, also declined to comment. Recent polls have shown Measure
W leading by up to 10 percentage points--but it could be vulnerable
to an infusion of funds spreading an opposing message, particularly
in more populous north Orange County, which is more amenable to an El
Toro airport.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation abounds among anti-airport forces as to why the
influence of Argyros, who recently became the U.S. ambassador to
Spain, hasn't been more visible.</TE>
<TE>   Argyros, who has promoted an airport as crucial to the future
economic health of Orange County, announced last spring when he was
nominated for the ambassador's post that he would end his active
involvement in the airport campaign. But he didn't indicate whether
he would continue to support it financially.</TE>
<TE>   Argyros couldn't be reached for comment on whether he will
contribute in the remaining weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Some anti-airport activists are crediting U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer
(D-Calif.), who was heavily lobbied by airport foes to oppose
Argyros' nomination in the Senate. They speculated that Boxer--who
built her political career fighting the commercial conversion of a
closed military airfield in Marin County--had persuaded Argyros to
stop his pro-airport funding once in Madrid.</TE>
<TE>   Not so, according to Boxer spokesman David Sandretti.</TE>
<TE>   He said Boxer and Argyros did have a telephone conversation about
El Toro and Argyros' involvement in funding the airport cause. But he
said that call came after Boxer already had indicated she would
support Argyros' nomination.</TE>
<TE>   "It was in the context that the concern had been raised by a
number of constituents," Sandretti said. "This issue was brought to
the attention of Sen. Boxer and there was a discussion about it."</TE>
<TE>   It's not unusual that Argyros would take a hands-off approach on a
local political issue at this stage, prodded or not, said Jack
Pitney, a Republican analyst who teaches government at Claremont
McKenna College.</TE>
<TE>   "In practice, ambassadors like to steer clear of local
entanglements lest local politics cause problems for them in
Washington," Pitney said. "Obviously, there could be other factors.
But ambassadors tend to focus on their diplomatic duties. His
perspective has changed."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reason, airport foes are enjoying their position in
what so far has been a lopsided fight.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping that George is a practical enough individual to feel
that he won't pour any more money toward a losing cause,"
anti-airport spokesman Kranser said. "Even the richest man doesn't
want to throw away a dime on a losing cause."</TE>
<TE>   Pro-airport forces were banking on getting their message out
through the seven-figure public relations campaigns that were
approved by county government and Newport Beach but then blocked.
They insisted the messages wouldn't be propaganda, just facts about
why another airport for Orange County would be needed.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Irvine and a coalition of cities spent $7 million
fighting an airport during the Measure F campaign--spending that was
not lost on county supervisors or Newport Beach council members at
the time. Since Measure F didn't mention the airport plans for El
Toro, a judge allowed the local government spending to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   But the county's spending to address Measure W was halted after a
judge reviewed its "Just the Facts" literature and said it amounted
to advocacy for an airport project, which is mentioned in Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   Private anti-airport groups, meanwhile, continued their aggressive
fund-raising, tapping into the thousands of South County residents
who staunchly oppose an airport. The pro-airport campaign has never
had similar private financial backing.</TE>
<TE>   "Having relied on government money and Argyros for so long,
they've never generated the grass-roots fund-raising base that we
have," Kranser said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if past elections are a guide, most of the fund-raising for
Measure W will occur in the days leading up to March 5.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1994 election, Argyros gave $634,000 in the last two weeks
before the vote. Two years ago, he donated $1 million to the fight
against Measure F between the end of January and the March election.
In both of those elections, however, he had already given significant
early money to fuel the pro-airport campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-airport forces also have raised money late in past campaigns.
Two years ago, the two major "Yes on F" groups reported raising about
$200,000 by late January. In the next three weeks, they raised
$716,000 more. Overall, anti-airport forces spent about $1.7 million
on behalf of Measure F, according to reports filed with the county
registrar of voters.</TE>
<TE>   Late spending can be effective in a campaign, if it is part of an
overall strategy conceived well in advance of the final weeks, Pitney
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Money doesn't instantly turn into action," he said. "It takes
time to contact vendors and go through the logistical steps" to
target voters, prepare mailers and distribute literature.</TE>
<TE>   One Orange County political consultant said last week that he was
saving space for the "No on W" campaign on a slate mailing for
Republican voters--but sold it to the "Yes on W" effort when the
deadline passed without payment.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 150,000 voters have applied for absentee ballots, according
to county elections officials. Brochures that arrive after their
ballots are returned will be wasted.</TE>
<TE>   "Some votes already have been cast," Pitney said.</TE>

<HD>Helping Others Eases Volunteer's Problems</HD>
<DH>'It must have been something I learned from my mother,'
says the South Whittier mother of four.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were days when Gloria Garcia sat in the bathroom crying because
she could not understand a word her teachers were saying.</LD>
<LD>   The South Whittier resident hasn't had the easiest life. She
watched as her husband almost died in a knife fight, her mother
passed away after a stroke a few years ago and her family has
struggled with money problems as far back as she can remember.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been tough," said the 38-year-old mother of four. "I guess
we always found a way to make it."</LD>
<TE>   Her secret: giving to others.</TE>
<TE>   She doesn't have much money, but she does have time and gives so
much of it to help others that she doesn't have time to worry about
her own problems.</TE>
<TE>   It began when Garcia was a young cook and helped her church feed
the homeless in Mexico City. It has blossomed into volunteer work at
a South Whittier community center, church and just about anywhere
else that will let her.</TE>
<TE>   "It must have been something I learned from my mother," Garcia
said. "It's a blessing to be at the center. I feel like I owe them."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia came to the United States when she was 14, and despite
those tearful moments at home, eventually learned English. She
continues to take English classes at the Community Resource Center in
South Whittier.</TE>
<TE>   Carrying her books in a plastic supermarket bag, Garcia can be
seen walking up Carmenita Road early in the morning to get to her 8
a.m. computer class and walking back about 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Classes, Volunteering, Family Fill Her Day</TE>
<TE>   Long after her English as a second language and computer classes
are finished, Garcia can be found working every afternoon in the
community center's kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   The center, in its fourth year of operation, serves about 20,000
youths and adults a month in the low-income areas of South Whittier
and Santa Fe Springs. Youths mainly come for help with homework or
for counseling; adults come to be helped with English and job skills.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the center's adult visitors are typical of Garcia:
middle-aged Latinas with young children just entering school. The
free time allows these women the opportunity to take English classes.
Many rush out of the center after class to pick up their children.</TE>
<TE>   Although Garcia has suffered from fainting spells for the last
year, she does not consider the daily mile walk and work at the
center to be problems. She's followed this routine for two years, and
it gives her rosy cheeks and many admirers.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Gonzalez, the coordinator for the center's family learning
center, and other staff members greet Garcia with big smiles when she
walks through the center's doors and vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   "She is so nice to me," Garcia said humbly. "They are so nice to
me. Some days I don't want to leave."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia would do anything for the center, said JoAnn Eros-Delgado,
the center's director.</TE>
<TE>   "She's always willing to help," Eros-Delgado said. "She not only
helps her children and herself, but she still manages time for
others."</TE>
<TE>   At the center, Garcia does a little bit of everything: cooking,
cleaning, shelving books, even tutoring fellow students.</TE>
<TE>   Center Benefits Her Children Too</TE>
<TE>   In the afternoon, Garcia walks another half mile to pick up her
two youngest children, 5-year-old Denise and 8-year-old David, from
Loma Vista Elementary; then it's back to the center to get them help
with their homework.</TE>
<TE>   At least three times a week, and sometimes more often, Garcia and
her family attend the Life Tabernacle Apostolic Church, said her
13-year-old son, Erik.</TE>
<TE>   On Fridays, the Garcias gather in the living room of their
three-bedroom apartment to discuss the Bible.</TE>
<TE>   Hugo Garcia, Gloria's husband, calls this "family night," a night
when the family can discuss problems and give thanks.</TE>
<TE>   "Talking about the Bible with our children teaches them many
positive lessons that they will be using until they are old," said
41-year-old Hugo. "It has helped me and my wife through many hard
times. And there have been quite a few [over] the years."</TE>
<TE>   About two years ago, he almost lost his right leg in a freak
accident at his old warehouse job. His leg was pinned between a and
the loading dock.</TE>
<TE>   He collected worker's compensation, but the bills kept coming.
There was always enough money for the house payment, but sometimes
not enough for food.</TE>
<TE>   Hugo used a cane for more than a year and was unable to drive
during that time. His oldest son, Edward, then a freshman at
California High School, took a summer job to help make ends meet. The
Garcias sometimes had to borrow money and clothes from family and
friends.</TE>
<TE>   Then, one day the lights went out--their bill had gone unpaid--and
Gloria almost lost it. The stress was too much and her headaches and
fainting spells worsened. But the next day, she could still be seen
walking down Carmenita Road to the center.</TE>
<TE>   During this time, Hugo was restless and could not stand being home
alone.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I graduated from high school, I have always been working,"
said Hugo, a short man with a big love for his family.</TE>
<TE>   It took two surgeries to repair damaged ligaments and nerves in
Hugo's right knee. When he was able to walk without as much pain,
Hugo started joining Gloria at the center and eventually took courses
in the medical field.</TE>
<TE>   Hugo had grown up in East Los Angeles and began getting into
trouble when he was about 11 years old, when he also joined a gang.
He started dating Gloria after they met at Montebello High School,
but he did not change.</TE>
<TE>   About 20 years ago, Hugo made his first and almost last visit to
Beverly Hospital in Montebello. His kidney had been punctured when he
was stabbed in the back at a New Year's Eve party. He lost so much
blood he passed out; when he came to, he was in a hospital bed.</TE>
<TE>   Three months ago he returned to the hospital as a radiology
assistant. He learned of the courses that earned him his new job
through the community center.</TE>
<TE>   Gloria has no plans to stop volunteering at the center. But she
does have big plans. She's taking the computer class because she
wants to enroll at Rio Hondo College and eventually become a social
worker.</TE>
<TE>   To her it's the ideal job--another chance to help others.</TE>

<HD>Clinic Staff Blames Remodel for Illnesses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than half of the employees at a Hollywood health clinic have
filed workers' compensation claims in the last month, citing
illnesses caused by ongoing renovation that included asbestos
removal.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-seven of 50 employees at the county-run Hollywood-Wilshire
Health Center have filed industrial accident reports. They claim the
construction work has caused heavy dust, unidentified fumes,
excessive noise and possible asbestos exposure.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, the California Division of Occupational Safety and
Health is investigating the death of a clinic staff member last
month, a spokeswoman confirmed. Co-workers say the man's
AIDS-compromised immune system was unable to fight a fungus that he
may have inhaled at the clinic. Top county health officials said
several tests did not show the presence of any fungus in the
building.</LD>
<TE>   In general, the officials insisted that they had done everything
possible to protect employees and patients, including sealing off
areas where asbestos was being removed.</TE>
<TE>   But in a Jan. 29 memo obtained by The Times, the health
department's own project manager told one of his supervisors that he
shared the workers' safety concerns. He blamed the contractors.</TE>
<TE>   "The main theme throughout this project has been emphasis on the
construction workers' convenience at the expense of patient/staff
safety," project manager Jaime Banuelos wrote in a Jan. 29 memo to
Dr. Ricardo Calderon, the health officer for the area.</TE>
<TE>   Banuelos said construction supervisors had not done enough to
prevent mechanical problems, such as faulty air conditioning and
potential asbestos exposures. He also said that construction workers
left tools and equipment in hallways and work areas, further
endangering the staff and patients.</TE>
<TE>   After learning of the memo, a county Department of Health Services
spokesman acknowledged the county had problems with the contractor
throughout the project and said officials would review how to make
contractors more accountable in the future. The private contractor,
West Coast Nielsen of San Diego, could not be reached for comment
late Friday.</TE>
<TE>   On at least two occasions, officials said, the building had to be
closed to prevent possible exposure to asbestos.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 19, construction workers disconnected vents to work on the
air-conditioning system, but turned the system back on before the
vents were reconnected. That blew out the asbestos shield erected to
protect the work area.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they do not think that asbestos was spread through
the vents because the area had been cleaned of asbestos the day
before. The facility was evacuated and remained closed for two days.</TE>
<TE>   Then on Jan. 13--a Sunday--a worker discovered asbestos after
opening a second-floor duct. The building was closed for eight days
while crews cleaned and tested for particles. On two other occasions
during the renovation, the air-conditioning system failed, causing
the building to be shut for half a day in each case.</TE>
<TE>   The clinic renovation is now behind schedule. It was supposed to
be completed in December but now won't be finished until late March,
county officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Workers say the county hasn't done enough to protect them.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe there are still safety violations there, as well as
concerns about working violations," said Bart Diener, assistant
general manager of the Service Employees International Union, Local
660.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly understand that this is a department that's under
tremendous financial pressure right now.... Nonetheless, providing
safe working environments for workers is a basic need, especially for
a health department."</TE>
<TE>   Most of those complaining of illness have missed at least some
work, and nine are still out sick. They report symptoms including
sneezing, coughing, asthma, headaches and burning eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been very uncomfortable," said a public health investigator,
who declined to be identified for fear of retaliation. "It's like
being in Los Angeles during one of the worst smoggy days that you can
remember, because you have to breathe all this dust and you have
these red eyes and they're irritated."</TE>
<TE>   A second employee, a public health nurse who also spoke on
condition of anonymity, said she visited her doctor several times
with a hacking cough that took a month to go away, even with
antibiotics. Some of her colleagues have had similar coughs that have
lingered for months, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what we're at risk for," she said. "With asbestos
... you don't have any effects from it for many years."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. James Haughton, the county's public health medical director,
acknowledged that drilling into concrete may have produced some dust
and that he cannot say "with certainty" that no employee was exposed
to asbestos.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, "all of the federal regulations were met.... When we
knew that there was the possibility of asbestos contamination, we
shut down the building."</TE>
<TE>   Haughton said he did not doubt the veracity of employees' claims,
but added, "Some of our employees have a pattern of absenteeism even
without the construction."</TE>
<TE>   Complaints about health problems have persisted since the
beginning of the renovation project in late June. Cal/OSHA inspected
the building in September after receiving a complaint about air
contamination, leaking water from overheated pipes and excessive
noise from drilling into concrete.</TE>
<TE>   During their visit, inspectors were unable to validate the
complaint, but found other problems such as no written safety plan.
They fined the clinic $3,750, said Cal/OSHA spokeswoman Susan Gard.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Cal/OSHA began a separate inquiry into the death of a
public health investigator who had AIDS. The 52-year-old man had been
HIV-positive for years, and colleagues--suspecting a recent infection
was related to the renovation--reported his case to the state agency.</TE>
<TE>   Several workers said that before construction began, the county
promised that no work would occur during clinic operating hours.</TE>
<TE>   "And yet the construction went on eight hours a day because it was
more cost-effective than paying them for nights and weekends," said
one worker, who declined to be identified. "It was all a question of
dollars and cents."</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky has been a vocal supporter of
the clinic expansion, which would allow the patient load to double to
50,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   But his deputy, Ron Hansen, said Friday that the supervisor is
concerned about the employees' claims and has asked for a formal
report on the alleged problems.</TE>

<HD>Cowboy Chronicler Writes Again</HD>
<DH>History: At 92, David Lavender is still cranking out books
about the Old West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bad news for writers: It doesn't get easier.</LD>
<LD>   David Lavender is sure of it. At 92, he is still toiling over his
electric typewriter, trying to turn out yet another volume of Western
history.</LD>
<LD>   Even after some 40 books, a slew of prestigious awards and a
lifetime poured into the craft of narrative, he joins the lamentation
of writers everywhere: "That damn first paragraph!" he says.</LD>
<TE>   Like a literary bounty hunter, Lavender has roamed the West,
plucking his subjects from lonely places on the plains, Indian
reservations, silver mines, cattle drives, the wilderness camps of
the fur trappers, the boardrooms of the railroad barons. Along the
way, there were a few novels, although Lavender quips that a frail
imagination drew him back to history.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to have my plots ready-made," he says.</TE>
<TE>   While Lavender's work has earned him a sizable following, he never
has attained the superstar status of such historians as Stephen
Ambrose, who has been accused of lifting more than half a dozen of
Lavender's passages nearly word for word.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Forbes magazine's Web site, www.forbes.com, added to
the charges of plagiarism that have beset the perennially
best-selling Ambrose. It noted striking similarities between passages
in "Nothing Like It in the World," Ambrose's recent book about the
transcontinental railroad, and "The Great Persuader," Lavender's 1970
biography of railroad magnate Collis P. Huntington.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Ambrose wrote: "What interested him were the widely
spaced saddles in the ridge line. By weaving in and out of them, the
railroad could ascend toward the ultimate crest of the mountains on
an even grade not in excess of the capability of the locomotives, or
a maximum of a hundred feet per mile."</TE>
<TE>   Three decades earlier, Lavender had written: "What interested him
were those widely spaced saddles in the ridgetop. By weaving in and
out of them, his railway ... could ascend toward the ultimate crest
of the mountain on an even grade not in excess of the capabilities of
the locomotives of his time."</TE>
<TE>   Harsh Words for Fellow Historian</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose has said he regrets not placing quotation marks around the
words of others. However, he also has defended such liberal
borrowing, pointing out that his sources are named in footnotes.</TE>
<TE>   From his living-room couch, Lavender says that is no defense at
all.</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose "tells a good story but he's sloppy about it," Lavender
contends, criticizing the author for relying on paid researchers,
including some family members. "How the hell can you possibly manage
something like that?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   Lavender is known among academics as much for his careful research
as for his ability to spin a yarn.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's a treasure," says Tom Andrews, executive director of
the Historical Society of Southern California. "He's not only a bona
fide literary writer in the best sense, but also a first-rate
historian. He's been checked out in a number of ways and never found
wanting."</TE>
<TE>   Martin Ridge, a Western historian and former editor of the Journal
of American History, says Lavender has managed to write engagingly
about the West without romanticizing it.</TE>
<TE>   "He tells the story and lets the chips fall where they may," says
Ridge. "If you know him personally, you know you're dealing with
someone who takes his work seriously--but not himself."</TE>
<TE>   In search of source material, Lavender has haunted museums and
research libraries. Over the years, he has logged countless miles on
his travels through the West, riding horses and rafting rivers to
steep himself in the places he writes about.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not?" he asks with a wink. "Is it my fault if the fish bite
there?"</TE>
<TE>   Home Full of Treasures From Western Travels</TE>
<TE>   In Ojai, his hilltop home is something like his
prose--straightforward, with touches of elegance. An orchid sits in
the sunlight on the sill of a window looking out to the Topatopa
Mountains. On a wall hang a couple of old rifles--one a pre-Civil War
weapon that Lavender found on a trek years ago when he took shelter
in a long-abandoned cabin. Black-and-white photographs show his
family's old ranch in southwestern Colorado, an endless stretch of
sage and scrub where he would like his ashes scattered.</TE>
<TE>   Lavender grew up 20 miles--a two-day horseback ride, he
notes--from the tough mining town of Telluride. Although he came from
a prominent family-- his grandfather was a Colorado Supreme Court
justice--Lavender was a ranch kid down to his bones and had a
difficult time in his late teens when he tried to fit in at
Princeton.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't talk the same, I didn't think the same, I didn't act the
same," he says. "I never learned how to play tennis."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, he picked up a flair for writing and a passion for
history--both utterly useless for his postgraduate life riding the
range and laboring in a gold mine back home.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote of those days in his first significant book, "One Man's
West," a collection of sketches that starts with the memorable line:
"Came a day when I wanted to get married and needed a stake."</TE>
<TE>   "One Man's West" is packed with the kind of vivid descriptions
that would come to spice Lavender's volumes of history. Of a mule
packer in the Colorado mountains, he wrote:</TE>
<TE>   "To keep his ears warm he wore a blue bandanna tied over his head,
like a European peasant woman, and on top of this was jammed a
wide-brimmed black hat, sparkling with frost rime. As further
protection against the weather he had grown a thick, short beard, and
out of this his nose stuck red as a cherry and adorned with a
glittering pendant of moisture that danced and jiggled as he
moved...."</TE>
<TE>   Lavender chuckles over the memory of what he calls his "homesick
book."</TE>
<TE>   When "One Man's West" came out in 1943, Lavender was teaching
English at Ojai's Thacher School, a boarding school where he would
lead camping trips and encourage young writers for the next 27 years.</TE>
<TE>   "One Man's West" led to "The Big Divide," a history of the
Rockies. The rest, as they say, is history: "Let Me Be Free," the
tragic saga of the Nez Perce Indians; "The Way to the Western Sea,"
the story of Lewis and Clark's epic expedition; and works on the
Colorado River, San Francisco banker William Ralston, the
colonization of the Southwest, the Northwest fur trade, several
histories for younger readers, and on and on.</TE>
<TE>   His current project: a look at misguided government efforts to
battle forest fires. "It took them 100 years to learn that what they
were doing was completely wrong!" he grouses.</TE>
<TE>   Myths Persist, Despite Historian's Efforts</TE>
<TE>   These days, Lavender moves slowly and is no longer a fixture at
the conclaves of Western scholars. He corresponds with former
students--some of them men in their 70s who still adore him.
Occasionally he devours a detective novel. With his wife Muriel, he
keeps up on news of his extended family; his son David is a
fund-raiser who splits his time between Ojai and Telluride, and he
has a passel of stepchildren and grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   That Lavender hasn't vaulted to celebrity status or seen his books
turned into movies doesn't much concern him. He is more exercised by
the persistence of Western myths, despite his efforts to lance them.</TE>
<TE>   Here is Lavender on cowboys: "Although they were slaves to a
particularly stupid and unattractive animal, they became symbols of
the West's vaunted freedom...."</TE>
<TE>   Life and death in the saloons was downright depressing, as
Lavender shows in his account of the funeral for a man killed in a
Telluride bordello brawl:</TE>
<TE>   "Behind the entourage straggled a squad of girls from the honky
tonks, clutching their long tight skirts as they waded through the
hoof-churned, manure-stained slush of the streets ....The throngs on
the sidewalks fell momentarily still, each man bleak with his own
secret thoughts."</TE>
<TE>   But myths go on. Cowboys aimed their guns more at rattlesnakes and
sick cows than at each other. Sacajawea, the 16-year-old Indian girl
who traveled with Lewis and Clark, was not the invaluable guide of
legend, Lavender reminds his readers. "Her knowledge of geography,
even that of her own homeland, proved almost nonexistent," he writes.</TE>
<TE>   And Chief Joseph, the eloquent leader of the Nez Perce, never
wrote a famous speech that has been repeatedly attributed to him,
even on a plaque at an Oklahoma Indian museum.</TE>
<TE>   "Once upon a time I used to distress over these things," Lavender
says as the logs in his living-room fireplace sputter and pop. "But
now, that's just the way it goes."</TE>

<HD>Riverside's New Top Cop Strives to Heal Old Rifts</HD>
<DH>Police: Reformist chief has rebuilt bridges to the black
community. But that could change if fired officers are rehired.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Much the way the police beating of Rodney King enraged the black
community in Los Angeles, the 1998 shooting of Tyisha Miller rocked
the city of Riverside.</LD>
<LD>   But Riverside's new top cop, unlike Los Angeles Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks, has managed to broker a delicate peace, satisfying
officers and African American community leaders while carrying out
sweeping reform under the scrutiny of federal and state justice
officials.</LD>
<LD>   All that progress could unravel in the coming weeks, however, when
city officials must decide if they will rehire two officers fired as
a result of the Miller shooting.</LD>
<TE>   "It would be a shame," cautioned the Rev. Paul Mumford of New Joy
Baptist Church in Riverside, "if they made a decision that would undo
all the good work they've done."</TE>
<TE>   Activists on all sides agree that after 17 months in office,
Riverside Police Chief Russ Leach--a former LAPD manager--has managed
to implement reforms without alienating rank-and-file officers.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders are supportive. And the black community is warming
to him.</TE>
<TE>   Leach walked into a delicate situation after taking over from
Chief Jerry Carroll, whose retirement was partly brought on by the
drama that followed the fatal shooting by white officers of Miller, a
19-year-old black woman who was passed out in her car with a gun in
her lap.</TE>
<TE>   Bolstered by his success, Leach now makes his way around the law
enforcement talk circuit with a speech titled "Lessons Learned,
Riverside Police Department." He delivered it most recently at the
annual conference of California police chiefs in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Even a consultant for the state attorney general's office charged
with enforcing Riverside Police Department reforms ordered by the
U.S. Justice Department is impressed with the progress. "I think the
right leadership is clearly in place," Joseph Brann said.</TE>
<TE>   But the officer rehiring issue promises to jolt Leach's delicate
tightrope walk. Chief Carroll in 1999 fired the four officers who
took part in the shooting. With less than 18 months' seniority,
Officers Dan Hotard and Paul Bugar had no union rights to appeal
their terminations. But the other two, veteran Officers Mike Alagna
and Wayne Stewart, did appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, an independent arbitrator found their firings unjust.
The city has until April 21 to rehire them or appeal the finding in
court.</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer representing Alagna and Stewart, William Hadden, already
is gearing up for a battle if the city objects. So far, Hadden said,
the decision to terminate the officers has been driven by politics,
not the facts.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't exonerate an employee and then fire him.... It's
incomprehensibly stupid," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Reputation as Bigoted Department</TE>
<TE>   Leach took over the Riverside department in September 2000,
replacing a chief who had risen through the ranks. Carroll was well
liked by officers because he was one of them. But the department
suffered, city officials said. Supervision was lax and police
policies were routinely ignored. Annual performance reviews for
officers fell behind. Citizen complaints went unanswered. And the
department's reputation as a bigoted organization that indulged in
racial profiling grew.</TE>
<TE>   That reputation became so bad that applications to join the
department plummeted, said Lt. Pete Curzon, who oversees recruiting.
In 1999, Riverside was able to hire just two new officers, despite
having more than 20 vacancies. But last year, the department made 42
hires.</TE>
<TE>   One of Leach's first challenges was turning around the
department's image. A 20-year Los Angeles Police Department veteran
and community policing advocate, he ran the LAPD's Harbor Division
before taking a job as police chief in El Paso in 1995. Three years
later, he became deputy director of the national organization Drug
Abuse Resistance Education, or DARE, in Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   He jokes about returning to police work and taking on a department
in crisis. "I thought, 'If I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna find the most
challenging job I can,'" Leach said. "And I found it."</TE>
<TE>   His very first task was to review a slew of deeply critical
reports about the department: the U.S. Justice Department, state
Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, the county grand jury and independent
consultants.</TE>
<TE>   He then sat down with Lockyer's office to work out a series of
reforms. It was the first time in California history that the state
had mandated changes within a police department.</TE>
<TE>   At first, city officials bristled at the thought of a
court-ordered consent decree. Riverside City Council members, who
begrudgingly approved the settlement under threat of a lawsuit a year
ago, were insulted at the implication that they couldn't clean up
their own house. Officer morale plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there was just a good bit of denial going on," Leach
said. "But when you examined all the evidence, it's clear there was a
management failure here and the results were disastrous. Change was
needed."</TE>
<TE>   He embraced the process. And, in a move that Leach believes was
critical to ensure officer support of the reforms, he invited the
police union's then-president, Lt. Jay Theuer, to sit in on the
negotiations. It worked, Theuer said. "It was clear we had some
strong, definitive leadership, and we were ready for that," he said.
"We were ready to take the medicine and get well."</TE>
<TE>   And they have, even when some of the changes meant a reduction in
officer independence. The briefing room, where racist jokes
occasionally were told during roll calls, now has a television
camera, with monitors placed throughout the department, including the
chief's office. A citizens review panel now regularly monitors police
activity.</TE>
<TE>   Other changes include tripling the hours for cultural diversity
training, biannual performance reviews, and a 30-day turnaround for
responding to citizen complaints.</TE>
<TE>   All officers will soon be required to tape-record their
interactions with the public, and later this year the department will
begin installing video cameras in patrol cars.</TE>
<TE>   The city also agreed to add 22 positions. Most of them are
supervisor slots, including an assistant chief position, four
lieutenants, one captain and 11 sergeants. And the department has
increased its hiring of black officers at all levels.</TE>
<TE>   Leach has moved to bolster morale by approving 42 promotions in
the last 12 months, all of them from inside the department. He also
lobbied the City Council to approve pay raises for officers.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy simply came in and told the council, 'Look, if you want
good people, then you have to pay good wages,'" Theuer said.</TE>
<TE>   Reaching Out to Black Community</TE>
<TE>   Leach, who is white, also is making friends in neighborhoods where
his department was reviled not so long ago. He created a chief's
advisory panel, which includes some of the department's most
outspoken critics as members, including Riverside NAACP President
Waudier Rucker-Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very pleased with the chief," said Rucker-Hughes, who, after
the Miller killing, was a regular at the protest marches and rallies
outside the department's downtown headquarters. "There's still work
to be done, but the tenor of the black community today is that they
are hopeful and willing to give it a try."</TE>
<TE>   In what Rucker-Hughes describes as a peace offering, Leach was
invited to introduce the keynote speaker at the National Assn. for
the Advancement of Colored People's annual Freedom Fund Banquet in
Riverside earlier this month. Standing before a crowd of 400 people,
including a group of Riverside police union leaders, Leach introduced
his friend and former boss, L.A. Chief Parks.</TE>
<TE>   The Riverside department's most outspoken critic, the Rev. Bernell
Butler, who became the Miller family spokesman, said he thinks much
of the good work being done in the Riverside Police Department is a
direct result of the high-profile marches and rallies he helped
organize.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of our efforts, we have saved lives," said Butler, who
said he has never spoken to Chief Leach but approves of what he's
done so far. Still, he said, he has a healthy amount of skepticism
about local police authority.</TE>
<TE>   "They've made changes for the better." Butler said. "But for some
of these older officers, it's probably more of a dog-and-pony show.
That old racist mentality exists, and it's going to be hard for the
chief to make long-term progress until those officers are weeded
out."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Parker Nash, a sociology professor and director of the
Robert Presley Center for Crime and Justice Studies at UC Riverside,
agrees with Butler, saying that the most difficult change to make is
a change in mentality. That, he said, will take years and may come
only after the old guard has moved out or retired.</TE>
<TE>   "If you ask me if the chief has been successful at changing the
culture of the Riverside Police Department," said Parker, "I doubt
it.... Police cultures are slow and resistant to change, and it's
hard for someone who comes in at the top to make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Leach acknowledges that his work is just beginning. He says he'll
know he has really turned the corner when he starts getting
applications to join the department from the black community.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to recruit African Americans, because we haven't yet
proven that we treat African Americans well," Leach said. "That
perception is still out there and we have to overcome that.</TE>
<TE>   "But we're working very, very hard to earn that trust back and put
that shine back on the badge," he added.</TE>

<HD>County's Computer System Is Botching Medical Benefits</HD>
<DH>Aid: Setup designed to ease eligibility decisions often
wrongly denies benefits to the needy. Officials say worst problems
are fixed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA and CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A $152-million Los Angeles County computer system that was supposed
to make faster and more accurate decisions about who is eligible for
government aid is millions of dollars over budget and is wrongly
denying medical benefits to needy children and families.</LD>
<LD>   Advocates for the poor say they have received hundreds of
complaints about pregnant women denied prenatal care, babies who were
not allowed vaccinations and sick children turned away by medical
professionals. Some poor families who were cut off fell behind on
bills and had to move in with relatives.</LD>
<LD>   Aid recipients who are denied benefits often complain to the
county and, if that fails, sometimes turn to advocacy organizations.
Representatives of those groups say that when they call county
workers on behalf of their clients, they are told each time that the
problems were caused by the computer system.</LD>
<TE>   "The technology was supposed to be a blessing and it's been turned
into a curse," complained Linda Feldman, spokeswoman for the Venice
Family Clinic. "People are left without coverage. They're totally
vulnerable."</TE>
<TE>   Federal and state officials say they too are concerned that the
system is denying needy families the health care they deserve in part
because programs that potentially affect two out of every three
Medi-Cal recipients have not been automated.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really a question of will and priorities," said Glen
Rosselli, undersecretary of the state Health and Human Services
Agency. "It's unconscionable that they haven't addressed the
problem."</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the county Department of Public Social Services
acknowledge problems in the massive system, but insist that they have
worked out the major glitches and that the minor problems that remain
can be worked around. They blame the majority of continued errors on
county workers, who in December began receiving additional training
to help them master the extraordinarily complex system.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, there are problems that need to be fixed, but by and large,
most people are getting their benefits on time," said Jim Swedlow,
deputy director of the project. "It's not in a crisis state."</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials counter that there's no way to know how many are
being wrongfully denied--and that the glitches suggest that many
people could be harmed.</TE>
<TE>   "Counties ... have an obligation to expeditiously correct computer
programming problems that lead to erroneous Medicaid denials and
terminations," officials with the federal Department of Health and
Human Services wrote the county in September. "Because the L.A. ...
system does not recognize [certain Medicaid] program requirements,
the potential for erroneous case determinations is high."</TE>
<TE>   Slow Economy Makes It Bad Timing for Agencies</TE>
<TE>   Questions about the computer system's adequacy are particularly
relevant now, as the economic slowdown puts additional pressure on
welfare agencies to handle increases in demand for services.</TE>
<TE>   LEADER--which stands for Los Angeles Eligibility Automated
Determination Evaluation and Reporting system--was designed to
automate welfare eligibility determinations. One of the largest data
processing systems in the nation, LEADER replaced 18 different
smaller systems that helped county workers process applications for
government aid. Los Angeles County processes 700,000 such
applications annually.</TE>
<TE>   After 31/2 years of design, $66million in cost overruns and a
five-month test pilot, technology experts began phasing the LEADER
system into county offices in October 1999.</TE>
<TE>   But only about a third of the cases were entered into the system
before its memory ran out. It took Unisys, the contractor who built
the system, nine months to fix the capacity problem. The computer
giant repaired it for free, and the county overlooked the $1.3
million in fines it could have sought against Unisys for delivering
the completed system nine months late, according to county records.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates, Union Deny Claims of Compliance</TE>
<TE>   Last August, officials in the county welfare department deemed the
system a success. It was working in every office in "substantial
compliance" with the county contract, the department told the Board
of Supervisors in a memo asking the board to pay Unisys the remaining
$5.8million it was owed.</TE>
<TE>   But advocates and county workers union officials complain that it
was not working properly then and that it still is not.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the typical bureaucratic line. You don't want to say
publicly that this $150-million computer system is a piece of
[garbage]," Kim Lewis , a staff lawyer at the Western Center on Law
and Poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Among the cases advocates use to illustrate their frustration is
the experience of a Venice mother who worries that months of delay in
getting Medi-Cal may cost her daughter her sight.</TE>
<TE>   Four-year-old Miranda Robles was diagnosed in September with a
deteriorating eye condition requiring surgery. Doctors at the free
clinic who examined her say she needs to see a specialist to correct
the problem in her right eye, called amblyopia.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't catch [the condition] early, you can't make up for
the problem," said Dr. Anne Arikian, a staff physician at Venice
Family Clinic. "After a certain period, it becomes irreversible."</TE>
<TE>   Miranda should have immediately qualified for free health
insurance, advocates said. Instead, she waited for months because of
problems with the new system.</TE>
<TE>   Initially Miranda's application sat in a pile at the county for
three months--twice the federal time limit for processing them--amid
a backlog caused in part by workers getting used to the new system.
Then, the wrong information was processed, saddling the girl with an
improper $916 monthly deductible.</TE>
<TE>   Miranda's parents earn $1,940 a month working as a housekeeper and
gardener to support their three children and two other relatives, all
of whom live in a modest two-bedroom house.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the county Department of Public and Social Services
acknowledge that Miranda was improperly denied benefits and blame a
data-entry error for producing the wrong deductible.</TE>
<TE>   "We have identified the need for additional training and this is
another example of that need," said Swedlow, the county welfare
official. "The problem is that eligibility is horribly complex.
Because we are automating a highly complex system, the [computer]
system gets complex."</TE>
<TE>   Workers Can't Tell Why Benefits Are Cut Off</TE>
<TE>   In a survey of 200 workers that the county employees union
conducted of its members, a third said the system had improperly
denied a needy person benefits in the preceding two weeks. At times,
workers complain they don't even know why the system cuts off
benefits because it does not give adequate explanations and they find
it difficult to fix clerical errors.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a year, state officials suggested to the county that
they needed to beef up their technical support, said Elias S. Cortez,
California's chief information officer. He said he is not concerned
about whether the computer is computing, but rather about the
county's ability to prioritize complaints and ensure that workers get
the support they need to make the system work.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like there's a big need and it needs to be filled,"
Cortez said. "This is just going to be a leadership issue."</TE>
<TE>   'The Client Shouldn't Suffer for It'</TE>
<TE>   Advocates stress that whether the problems grow from training or
programming deficiencies is irrelevant to the needy people who are
not getting the help they need.</TE>
<TE>   "The client shouldn't suffer for it," said Lewis of the Western
Center on Law and Poverty. "They're too vulnerable for that."</TE>
<TE>   She and others want the department to review all denials and
terminations to ensure that they were not the result of computer
error or errors in using the computer, but the department has been
hesitant to agree.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases the denial of services has the potential for
permanent harm. Ten-year-old Ricardo Daniel Rodriguez, for instance,
grew so impatient with delays in benefits to pay for a dentist that
he resorted to pulling his own tooth.</TE>
<TE>   Ricardo's Medi-Cal benefits have been improperly cut off
repeatedly for the past year, county officials acknowledged. His
family would complain and get reinstated, only to lose the benefits
again--the result of a computer glitch that county officials failed
to identify for months.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Ricardo began suffering from a painful molar. His
mother, Anna Luque, tried dentist after dentist, but none would make
an appointment for Ricardo.</TE>
<TE>   "They said my Medi-Cal was cut off," explained Luque, 47, who
earns $1,000 a month from two part-time jobs as a child-care worker
and school aide. "Every time I call my [county case] worker, he says
it's a problem with the computer."</TE>
<TE>   She said her son couldn't wait for the computer problems for
relief. After a week of excruciating pain, Ricardo finally yanked out
the aching tooth himself.</TE>
<TE>   Swedlow, the welfare official, at first insisted Ricardo's
problems were caused by worker error. But after repeated queries by
The Times, he said he dug deeper and found a programming error that
caused incorrect information to be transmitted to the state's
Medi-Cal computer system, resulting in Ricardo's benefits being cut
off.</TE>
<TE>   Swedlow said "a small number" of other cases were also affected by
the problem, which has been fixed.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the other complaints about the system, workers say
it can take months to fix a problem even after it is detected.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials said two-thirds of workers surveyed said they had
written several "trouble tickets" complaining to department
technology experts of computer problems in the preceding six months.</TE>
<TE>   "It took over two months for the problem to be corrected," one
worker complained to the union as part of the survey. "In the
meantime, I was unable to work the case and the participant kept
calling and became very impatient."</TE>
<TE>   In another case, a 38-year-old single mother from West Covina
complained for months that her cash aid and food stamps were
fluctuating wildly and without reason. Her social worker submitted a
"trouble ticket" on the case, but it sat in a pile for five months,
wrongly tagged a low priority until press inquiries about it.</TE>
<TE>   Cost overruns related to the system came to light in December
1998, when Unisys and welfare officials asked and got the Board of
Supervisors to pay the computer giant $27 million to cover the
changes that welfare reform made to cash aid programs. That was on
top of the $86 million the computer giant had bid three years earlier
to build the massive system.</TE>
<TE>   It was also on top of the $20 million the county agreed to pay to
cover some of Unisys' costs when it complained that it had underbid.</TE>
<TE>   But county officials chose not to update the Medi-Cal programs at
the time. Instead, they decided that workers could temporarily make
eligibility calculations by hand, then override the system.</TE>
<TE>   State officials were baffled.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why, given that some of these things have been
required since 1998, why they were not incorporated in LEADER when
LEADER went into operation," said Bill Walsh of the state Health
Department. "It's worrisome and bothersome."</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said she is annoyed that
department officials have for months submitted reports indicating
that the system was working properly, suggesting there would be no
additional changes.</TE>
<TE>   On her motion, the Board of Supervisors last month ordered the
department to report any remaining system problems and cost estimates
on automating the outstanding Medi-Cal programs.</TE>
<TE>   Those updates will cost millions, of dollars, county welfare
officials said. The exact sum is the subject of ongoing negotiations
with Unisys.</TE>

<HD>At Cat Show, Some Hiss at New Breed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As expected, the buzz at this weekend's San Gabriel Valley Cat
Fanciers show focused on a recent advance in the world of cat
breeding. But it had little to do with the shorthair cloned kitten
that Texas A&amp;M scientists introduced to the world last week.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, it was the Munchkin--a relatively new breed of
short-legged, longhair cat--that generated all the commotion.</LD>
<LD>   In the time-honored tradition of cat breeding, this newcomer has
been exempt from most official cat show competitions.</LD>
<TE>   However, an event organizer announced Saturday at the Arcadia
Masonic Center that starting May 1, Munchkin cats will be able to
enter all competitions held by the International Cat Assn. Applause
broke out even before she had finished.</TE>
<TE>   All Munchkins are descended from a single cat: Blackberry, who was
found pregnant in a Louisiana barn in the mid-1980s. She passed on
her short legs to only half her litter--and ever since, there have
been efforts to refine the breed to promote short legs and
kitten-like behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Munchkin breeders insist that a spontaneous change in the genetic
makeup of the cat introduced the short-legged gene. Still, for many
entrants and some officials at the show--people who pay huge amounts
of money to breed their own cats to foster the right size tail,
correct color eyes and proper fat-to-muscle ratio--the Munchkin
represents an unsettling sort of genetic manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Beth Lewis, a Prescott, Ariz., resident who came to show off
Little Sofie, a snowy white, longhair Turkish Van, looked around her
at the Abyssinian, Tonkinese and Himalayan cats nearby. They reclined
in posh cages decorated in sequins, leopard print and lace, yawning
occasionally as their owners coddled them.</TE>
<TE>   "These are natural breeds," Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   "Not man-made," echoed her friend, June Abbot Calwell of
Riverside, as she cradled her blue-eyed Siamese cat, Lilac Louie, in
her arms.</TE>
<TE>   Would Calwell ever pay to have Lilac Louie--or some other favorite
cat--cloned?</TE>
<TE>   "No!" she said, recoiling at the thought. "I've had cats that were
special. But they were special because they were them. Not copies."</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Nolen, a judge from Dallas, said she had heard about the
work of the scientists at Texas A&amp;M and might consider cloning a
beloved cat. But as far as the Munchkin and other new breeds such as
the California Spangled and Ojos Azules are concerned, she was
skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "All new things don't exactly catch on," Nolen said about an hour
before the announcement about Munchkins was made.</TE>
<TE>   Nolen, 57, a schoolteacher, travels the world judging cat
competitions. At the San Gabriel Valley show, she spent most of her
day under a silk-flower decorated arch, ferrying cats back and forth
from cages to a waist-high competition table.</TE>
<TE>   She poked and prodded the cats before her, feeling under their
chins, inspecting their ears, running a practiced finger down
delicate spines.</TE>
<TE>   As she worked, Nolen chatted with the cats and their owners. She
debated whether one cat, a brown tabby called Tank, was cinnamon or
lilac colored. She announced that another, a hissing Burmese named
Amanda, could out-swear her any day.</TE>
<TE>   Troya Davidson, 45, of Carson watched from the sidelines as Nolen
held her gray household kitten, Satchmo, aloft.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson's adult female Abyssinian, HillStBlues, had already won
enough points to reach Grand Champion status. But she worried aloud
that Satchmo was too shy to compete: "If he doesn't start enjoying
it, we won't bring him to these shows anymore."</TE>
<TE>   For Davidson, cat shows such as this one are a way to meet cat
lovers and learn about other breeds. But as for further manipulation
of the species?</TE>
<TE>   "It's like, I'm glad to know they've proven they did it," she
said. "But I see no purpose in cloning cats for the sake of cloning
cats. They can do it on their own."</TE>

<HD>Bert Conway, 87; Actor, Director</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bert Conway, a stage actor and director whose 60-year show business
career included work in films and television, died Feb. 7 of heart
failure at his home in Mission Hills. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Orange, N.J., Conway was the son of vaudevillians--his
father was an acrobat and juggler, his mother a singer and pianist.
Conway studied at the Neighborhood Playhouse School in New York.</LD>
<LD>   In 1937, he joined the Group Theater as an assistant stage manager
and had a walk-on part as a boxing arena employee in Harold Clurman's
original 1937 staging of Clifford Odets' "Golden Boy."</LD>
<TE>   Within a year, Conway was playing a lead, as a reform school youth
in "Dance Night," staged by Lee Strasberg.</TE>
<TE>   After serving in the Army during World War II, Conway headed for
Hollywood, where he played minor parts in William Wyler's "The Best
Years of Our Lives" and Kazan's interracial drama "Pinky," and had
small roles in other films.</TE>
<TE>   Conway began directing in 1947 at the Actors Lab in Hollywood, and
he directed the first interracial production of "Golden Boy" for the
Negro Art Theater in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1950, caught up in the Hollywood blacklist era and finding
film job offers drying up, Conway returned to New York. After working
as an understudy in Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman," during
which he got to play Biff Loman "for one glorious week," Conway went
on to direct "Hedda Gabler" and "La Ronde" at the Actors Lab. He
subsequently directed an off-Broadway revival of "Deep Are the Roots"
and made appearances with Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare
Festival.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to road company productions of "The Caine Mutiny Court
Martial" and "On a Clear Day," he had small roles in the movies "The
Three Musketeers," "Little Big Man" and "The Arrangement," and on
TV's "St. Elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Conway also worked in local theater productions. With Los Angeles'
Group Repertory, he had roles in Miller's "A Memory of Two Mondays"
and in Eugene O'Neill's "Ah, Wilderness!"</TE>
<TE>   Conway was preceded in death by his wife of 21 years, Aletta, and
his brother. He is survived by a son, Robin of Mission Hills, and two
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Camarillo Violent Crime Rate Rises, Identity Thefts Double</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While crime declined in most local cities last year, reported
offenses rose in Camarillo for the second straight year as that
upscale community continued a tradition of steep swings in some
criminal offenses.</LD>
<LD>   Camarillo's serious crime increased only 5.5% overall, but a sharp
hike in violent incidents showed how easily statistics can shift up
or down in a city where the number of offenses is relatively small.</LD>
<LD>   "There weren't any significant changes that I'm concerned about,"
said Sheriff's Cmdr. David Tennessen, who acts as police chief in
Camarillo. "There was nothing that creates a real red flag for me."</LD>
<TE>   The 36% jump in felony violence last year represented 27 more
incidents of rape, robbery and felony assault for a total of 102. By
comparison, property crimes increased just 3.4%, or by 37 incidents,
largely because of big increases in auto thefts and arson.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Camarillo's serious crime increased by 64 incidents to
1,226. That equates to a rate of about 21 crimes per 1,000 residents,
a sharp drop from the historic high of 31.1 a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I always compare Camarillo to my hometown, Sioux Falls, S.D., and
[Camarillo] has an even lower crime rate," Tennessen said.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, Camarillo's crime rate is much lower than
Oxnard's or Ventura's, but well above Simi Valley's or Thousand
Oaks'. Its rate is lower than Ojai's, but double that of Moorpark,
the county's safest city.</TE>
<TE>   Despite large percentage increases in robbery, Tennessen said the
heists often involved bicycles or skateboards, and verbal threats
were used, not weapons. Likewise, he said most assaults were fights
between people who knew each other. Many were incidents in bar
parking lots--and not random acts of violence against residents.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not talking about Mr. and Mrs. Smith [being harmed while]
walking down the street," Tennessen said. "We're talking about
incidents where the suspects were known by the victims."</TE>
<TE>   Deputies are working with the owner of Dimensions bar in central
Camarillo--with assistance from state alcohol-license
investigators--to demand more security in the bar's parking lot, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Auto thefts also increased from 44 to 80 during the last year. But
Tennessen said that reflects a return to normal after an extremely
low total in 2000. "Our 10-year average is about 76 a year," he said.
Auto thefts totaled 188 in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   But, as with neighboring Thousand Oaks, Camarillo's most
significant crime trend last year was the emergence of so-called
identity theft, in which a criminal uses a stolen credit card to
commit theft or to create false bank accounts for fraudulent
purposes, Tennessen said.</TE>
<TE>   Identity thefts more than doubled to 206, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem was eliminated in mid-2001, when patrol
officers Conrad Harvey and Nora Soler stopped two Oxnard residents
for a blocked license plate, then arrested the pair after they ran
off.</TE>
<TE>   Det. Sgt. Patrick MacAuley linked documents found in the couple's
car to a sophisticated forgery and fraud ring that had claimed 1,100
victims across the nation and in foreign countries, Tennessen said.</TE>
<TE>   "They were using stolen credit card information downloaded off the
Internet to computers in their motel room," he said. "They used
stolen credit card information and banking information to create
documents and access bank accounts."</TE>
<TE>   Trevor Zeise was convicted of numerous felony counts and is
serving a six-year prison sentence, while his accomplice is in
custody in Ventura County Jail for some of the same offenses.</TE>
<TE>   Police have also made progress against credit card and check theft
by persuading some merchants at the popular Camarillo Premium Outlet
Mall to require buyers to use inkless fingerprinting on receipts.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, home and residential burglaries fell slightly last
year, continuing a decade-long drop from a high of 487 to 186.</TE>
<TE>   That high 1991 total reflected a surge in burglaries by Los
Angeles County thieves who dropped into town off the Ventura Freeway,
then left quickly after the crime, Tennessen said. A similar pattern
occurred in 1995. In both cases, a burglary ring was busted and total
crimes fell sharply.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessen said Camarillo now focuses on preventing such property
crimes through revitalizing Neighborhood Watch networks and by
assigning a four-person special enforcement unit to an area when a
trend is detected.</TE>
<TE>   "The officers can be on bikes or in plain clothes or in uniforms
for high visibility," Tennessen said. A spate of burglaries in
Camarillo Heights early last year was cut short by beefing up
patrols, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Special efforts to rally the community also apparently worked, he
said, since residents called police for help 22,000 times last year
compared with about 20,000 the year before.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been focusing on trying to get more and more information
out to the public," he said.</TE>

<HD>Agoura Hills Won't Contribute to Retail Project</HD>
<DH>Development: City backs off $1.5-million Home Depot
proposal because it lacked guarantee that builder would make road
improvements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Agoura Hills officials say they have rejected a proposal that the
city contribute $1.5 million toward a Home Depot-anchored retail
development.</LD>
<LD>   The officials say the proposal was unacceptable because it lacked
a guarantee that the builder would finish both phases of the project.</LD>
<LD>   Developer Dan Selleck had asked that the $1.5 million be spent
during the first phase of construction, City Atty. Craig Steele said.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal would have given Selleck the option to complete the
second phase, which would include improvements to Agoura Road.</TE>
<TE>   "Any developer is going to ask for as much flexibility as
possible," Steele said. "As a city, we want to have as much certainty
as possible."</TE>
<TE>   He added that the Home Depot negotiations also have yet to resolve
whether the developer or city would pay to widen the two-lane Agoura
Road and bury utility lines.</TE>
<TE>   Selleck could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The developer and city have been in negotiations for years. The
Home Depot is the centerpiece of a redevelopment plan for the area.
Opposition to it led to Measure H, a March 5 ballot initiative that
would block construction of stores larger than 60,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   If approved, the measure would close the door to Home Depot.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Jeff Reinhardt called Measure H "a very sweeping
proposal that goes too far and locks that policy into the city's
ordinances in perpetuity. It's like using an atomic bomb to swat a
fly."</TE>
<TE>   The measure comes at a time when anticipated state budget cuts,
highway intersection upgrades and higher costs for law enforcement
have created a need for additional sales tax revenue, Reinhardt said.</TE>
<TE>   The scheduled reconstruction of the Kanan Road/Ventura Freeway
intersection alone will cost $23 million, including more than $12
million in city funds, Reinhardt said.</TE>
<TE>   The city's total annual budget is $8 million.</TE>
<TE>   Voters in 1997 defeated a proposed 3% utility tax that would have
raised $700,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   After considering other avenues for funding, Reinhardt said, new
retail emerged as the most attractive.</TE>
<TE>   "By defeating the utility tax, voters made us purely dependent on
retail for discretionary funds," Reinhardt said.</TE>
<TE>   All five council members' names appear on a political mailer
urging a "no" vote on Measure H.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the council members have not taken a position on the Home
Depot project, which would require their approval.</TE>
<TE>   "I still have a hard time seeing that I'd ever vote for a big
box," Councilman Dan Kuperberg said.</TE>
<TE>   But Kuperberg also said that Home Depot may be the only retailer
with enough sales volume to provide the amount of tax revenue the
city needs.</TE>
<TE>   Six former mayors of Agoura Hills last week joined the council in
opposing Measure H. Thom Bancroft, a spokesman for Taxpayers Opposed
to Special Treatment, which opposes the measure, said the initiative
would prevent the council from responding to population growth.</TE>
<TE>   "As the city grows, where is money going to come from, if not
retail sales tax?" Bancroft asked.</TE>
<TE>   If Measure H fails, a host of hurdles would still stand in the way
of Home Depot, including negotiations with landowners and opposition
from residents and small businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The Citizens for Responsible Growth, formed last year by three
business owners, spearheaded the signature drive that got Measure H
on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The group has spent about $140,000 to promote the measure. Much of
the money was contributed by Do It Center, Agoura Equipment Rentals
and Roadside Lumber.</TE>
<TE>   Do It Center is a Home Depot competitor. The other two businesses
are in the redevelopment zone, and their owners are concerned about
the plan's possible effect on their properties.</TE>

<HD>Making Their Duty His Duty</HD>
<DH>Pollution: Laguna Beach hires a $100-a-month dog-manure
remover to curb runoff. 'To make a change, we all have to be
creative,' the mayor says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It probably should come as no surprise in a city that uses goats as
part of its fire-prevention program that Laguna Beach is battling
urban runoff with a professional pooper scooper.</LD>
<LD>   Entre-Manure Dog Waste Removal Service of Dana Point has a
contract with the city to remove droppings from the dog park and in
the Top of the World neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to making these areas more aesthetically pleasing, the
city hopes that the reduction in dog waste means less contaminated
runoff flowing to its shoreline.</LD>
<TE>   "We want places that we all frequent to be clean of dog fecal
matter, and it's obvious that at these locations, during the rainy
season, it will wash right down into the canyons and the arroyos and
onto the beach," said Wayne Baglin, mayor of Laguna Beach.</TE>
<TE>   That's where Craig Stern, founder of Entre-Manure, comes in.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the city awarded him a contract to clean the dog park
and Top of the World areas once a month. In about five hours, he
scooped 50 pounds of droppings.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy to report that's 50 pounds of concentrated pollution
that will never make it out to the ocean," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Runoff From Waste Contaminates the Ocean</TE>
<TE>   According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, urban
runoff is the No. 1 cause of coastal pollution. Laguna Beach has the
same runoff problem as other coastal communities in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   The toxic mix of pet waste, fertilizer, metals and other
pollutants is washed from streets and lawns, and flows to the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The dog park and Top of the World areas were selected because both
are known for having excessive dog waste, and heavy rains easily
flush the waste into the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach is known for offbeat solutions to environmental
problems. The city's decision to hire Stern for $100 a month is only
the latest example. Goats eat a 200- to 300-foot-wide swath of brush
around the city's perimeter to serve as a firebreak.</TE>
<TE>   The city was among the first in Southern California to divert its
storm drain runoff into the sewer system, rather than allowing it to
flow unimpeded into the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "To make a change, we all have to be creative," Baglin said. "This
is one of those things that's very creative."</TE>
<TE>   Stern, an avid bicyclist, said he always felt disgusted when he
ran into piles of manure on trails. He started his company about six
months ago after reading a newspaper article about a similar
enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Stern scoured the Top of the World area for pet
droppings. Wearing rubber gloves and a surgical mask, he began raking
and shoveling waste into a pooper-scooper lined with a plastic bag.
Before long, he bagged 18 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Most people pick up after their pets, and the few who don't give
the rest a black eye, he said. "Most dog owners are responsible and
hate to have that stigma on them from the ones that are flagrant,"
Stern said.</TE>
<TE>   Stern hopes to persuade other coastal cities and Orange County to
buy his services. His company's motto? "No. 1 in the No. 2 business."</TE>

<HD>Campaign Money's on Park for El Toro</HD>
<DH>Elections: Backers of Measure W, fighting a proposed
airport at the closed Marine base in Orange County, are spending far
more than their opposition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Less than three weeks before election day, the only aggressive
campaign being waged over the fate of the closed El Toro Marine base
is by opponents of Orange County's plans to build an airport there.</LD>
<LD>   So far, they've sent several mailers countywide urging a vote for
Measure W, the initiative on the March 5 ballot that would rezone the
4,700-acre property for use primarily as a public park.</LD>
<LD>   But what was expected to be a significant counter effort to
convince voters of the benefits of a proposed airport handling 18.8
million passengers a year has not materialized.</LD>
<TE>   No one is more surprised by that than the anti-airport troops.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't heard of them doing anything," said Len Kranser,
spokesman for Citizens for Safe and Healthy Communities, the
anti-airport effort based in south Orange County. "They have some
signs up, but that's it."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County supervisors had pledged to spend $6 million this
fiscal year on mailers and public forums detailing the county's
airport plans. That spending was halted in December when a San Diego
County judge ruled that the mailings violated state law barring
government campaign advocacy.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach had earmarked $3.7 million more to argue for an
alternative to John Wayne Airport, but that spending also was stopped
to settle a similar lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the absence of the airport campaign's chief--and
essentially only--private sector donor, billionaire businessman
George Argyros, who since 1994 has spent nearly $3.5 million on
initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   At this time two years ago, Argyros had given $237,364 to the
campaign to defeat Measure F. That initiative, on the March 2000
ballot, would have mandated voter approval before any new airport,
large jail or hazardous landfill could be built near homes. It passed
with 67% of the vote but was overturned in the courts.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, the committee Argyros has traditionally funded
has not filed any campaign finance reports because it hasn't raised
more than $1,000, according to organizers. The other airport advocacy
group, the Airport Working Group of Orange County, has reported
raising $42,220 through Jan. 22.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-airport "Yes on W" group reported raising $550,000
through Jan. 19. Since then, it said it has hit the $2-million mark
in contributions and pledges.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Nestande, a former county supervisor who has headed Argyros'
pro-airport committee since 1994, said more money has been collected
in the last month, but he declined to reveal how much. The next
required campaign report is due Friday and will include the tally
from a pro-airport fund-raiser held this month at Antonello's
Ristorante in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Airport advocates have been tight-lipped about their fund-raising
efforts. David Ellis, the Airport Working Group's longtime
consultant, also declined to comment. Recent polls have shown Measure
W leading by up to 10 percentage points--but it could be vulnerable
to an infusion of funds spreading an opposing message, particularly
in more populous north Orange County, which is more amenable to an El
Toro airport.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation abounds among anti-airport forces as to why the
influence of Argyros, who recently became the U.S. ambassador to
Spain, hasn't been more visible.</TE>
<TE>   Argyros, who has promoted an airport as crucial to the future
economic health of Orange County, announced last spring when he was
nominated for the ambassador's post that he would end his active
involvement in the airport campaign. But he didn't indicate whether
he would continue to support it financially.</TE>
<TE>   Argyros couldn't be reached for comment on whether he will
contribute in the remaining weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Some anti-airport activists are crediting U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer
(D-Calif.), who was heavily lobbied by airport foes to oppose
Argyros' nomination in the Senate. They speculated that Boxer--who
built her political career fighting the commercial conversion of a
closed military airfield in Marin County--had persuaded Argyros to
stop his pro-airport funding once in Madrid.</TE>
<TE>   Not so, according to Boxer spokesman David Sandretti.</TE>
<TE>   He said Boxer and Argyros did have a telephone conversation about
El Toro and Argyros' involvement in funding the airport cause. But he
said that call came after Boxer already had indicated she would
support Argyros' nomination.</TE>
<TE>   "It was in the context that the concern had been raised by a
number of constituents," Sandretti said. "This issue was brought to
the attention of Sen. Boxer and there was a discussion about it."</TE>
<TE>   It's not unusual that Argyros would take a hands-off approach on a
local political issue at this stage, prodded or not, said Jack
Pitney, a Republican analyst who teaches government at Claremont
McKenna College.</TE>
<TE>   "In practice, ambassadors like to steer clear of local
entanglements lest local politics cause problems for them in
Washington," Pitney said. "Obviously, there could be other factors.
But ambassadors tend to focus on their diplomatic duties. His
perspective has changed."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reason, airport foes are enjoying what so far has
been a lopsided fight.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping that George is a practical enough individual to feel
that he won't pour any more money toward a losing cause,"
anti-airport spokesman Kranser said. "Even the richest man doesn't
want to throw away a dime on a losing cause."</TE>
<TE>   Pro-airport forces were banking on getting their message out
through the seven-figure public relations campaigns that were
approved by county government and Newport Beach but then blocked.
They insisted the messages wouldn't be propaganda, just facts about
why another airport for Orange County would be needed.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Irvine and a coalition of cities spent $7 million
fighting an airport during the Measure F campaign--spending that was
not lost on county supervisors or Newport Beach council members at
the time. Since Measure F didn't mention the airport plans for El
Toro, a judge allowed the local government spending to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   But the county's spending to address Measure W was halted after a
judge said its "Just the Facts" literature amounted to advocacy for
an airport project, which is mentioned in Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   Private anti-airport groups, meanwhile, kept up aggressive
fund-raising, tapping into the thousands of South County residents
who staunchly oppose an airport. The pro-airport campaign has never
had similar private backing.</TE>
<TE>   "Having relied on government money and Argyros for so long,
they've never generated the grass-roots fund-raising base that we
have," Kranser said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if past elections are a guide, most of the fund-raising for
Measure W will occur in the days leading up to March 5.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1994 election, Argyros gave $634,000 in the last two weeks
before the vote. Two years ago, he donated $1 million to the fight
against Measure F between the end of January and the March election.
In both of those elections, however, he had already given significant
early money to fuel the pro-airport campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-airport forces also have raised money late in past campaigns.
Two years ago, the two major "Yes on F" groups reported raising about
$200,000 by late January. In the next three weeks, they raised
$716,000 more. Overall, anti-airport forces spent about $1.7 million
on behalf of Measure F, according to reports filed with the county
registrar of voters.</TE>
<TE>   Late spending can be effective in a campaign, if it is part of a
strategy conceived well in advance of the final weeks, Pitney said.</TE>
<TE>   "Money doesn't instantly turn into action," he said. "It takes
time to contact vendors and go through the logistical steps" to
target voters, prepare mailers and distribute literature.</TE>
<TE>   One Orange County political consultant said last week that he was
saving space for the "No on W" campaign on a slate mailing for
Republican voters--but sold it to the "Yes on W" effort when the
deadline passed without payment.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 150,000 voters have applied for absentee ballots, according
to county elections officials. Brochures that arrive after their
ballots are returned will be wasted.</TE>
<TE>   "Some votes already have been cast," Pitney said.</TE>

<DL>BAKER, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The line started here, in the middle of nowhere.</LD>
<LD>   Outside of Will's Country Store along the main road between Los
Angeles and Las Vegas, thousands of would-be millionaires snaked
around the block Saturday, many pouring in from out of state.</LD>
<LD>   They were farmers and factory workers, gamblers and grandmothers.
Most drove. One man flew his plane to the nearest landing strip and
walked two miles. They came from Modesto, Van Nuys, Las Vegas, even
London. All were hoping for a piece of the record-breaking
$193-million California Lottery jackpot.</LD>
<TE>   Baker, population roughly 600, is little more than a fuel stop
along Interstate 15 in the Mojave Desert, less than an hour from the

<TE>   Its claim to fame is the Bun Boy Motel, home of what is billed as
the world's tallest thermometer. But the country store, boasting a
sign that reads, ''The Lucky Spot in the Desert,'' is becoming a
legend in its own right. It has sold five winning lottery tickets
since 1988, most recently a $14-million ticket in 1996, making it the
second-winningest store in the state. Earning top honors is Allan's
Wine &amp; Lotto in Port Hueneme, in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Will's Country Store and another Baker spot, the Dry Lake Store,
also both ranked in the top 12 locations for total lottery sales last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Will's sold about $1.78 million in tickets and Dry Lake sold
nearly $1.65 million.</TE>
<TE>   People remember that sort of thing when the highest total of any
lottery in the country involving just one state is up for grabs.
Saturday's jackpot was also the largest in the 16-year history of the
California Lottery, and beat the previous record of $141 million,
which a San Jose man won last June.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the place to be," said Mary Whitaker, 54, a bank
executive from Modesto who stopped in Baker on her way to Vegas. "I
think I'll do better in the casino," she admitted. "But there's a
different allure with this. It's like fate."</TE>
<TE>   Lotto fever spread like an epidemic through California and even
across its borders Saturday, with hopeful players streaming into the
state from Nevada, Oregon and even Mexico to try their hand at the
jackpot.</TE>
<TE>   They crowded into corner stores and grocery marts, using birth
dates, ages and anniversaries to pick their numbers. As ticket sales
soared throughout the day, the pot continued to climb. Between 5 and
6 p.m., buyers spent $6.1 million on tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Though the winning numbers--6, 11, 31, 32, 39 and Meganumber
20--flashed across television screens just before 8 p.m. Saturday,
Lotto officials may not know until Tuesday if anyone won the jackpot.</TE>
<TE>   The lottery offices will be closed Monday for Presidents Day.</TE>
<TE>   If nobody has the winning combination, the jackpot will swell even
higher for Wednesday night's drawing.</TE>
<TE>   Lines stretched out the door at several stores throughout the
Southland that have a history of selling winning tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of gamblers flocked to Momma's Mini Mart in Anaheim,
placing their trust--and their cash--in the belief that luck would
strike the same place twice.</TE>
<TE>   A purple banner hanging over the store announced: "Millionaire
Made Here," a reminder, if locals needed any, that a customer turned
a $3 ticket into an $87-million jackpot three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the lucky place," said Cain Franco, 31, who installs
garage doors for a living. "I want to hit the big one!"</TE>
<TE>   The Lotto craze caused a stir at Mr. C's Liquor in San Pedro,
where three multimillion-dollar tickets have been sold since 1989.
Police officers had to negotiate peace between ticket buyers and
nearby churchgoers.</TE>
<TE>   A line of 100 would-be millionaires snaked from the lottery
machine on the counter past the saltine crackers, out the door and
right past the front doors of Bethany Apostolic Community Church,
which shares a parking lot with Mr. C's.</TE>
<TE>   Church members said they called police when their side of the lot
was swamped by ticket-buyers, some of whom refused to move until they
had bought their tickets.</TE>
<TE>   "We scheduled a prayer convention for today," said Richard Holmes,
associate pastor at Bethany. "But there's more people out here than
inside."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Anna Gorman, Jack Leonard and Carol Chambers
contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Lawn Bowling More Than Just a Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Al Pollock was working the lawn bowling crowd like a comic in the
Catskills.</LD>
<LD>   "He's two years older than God, this guy," the rotund,
white-bearded Pollock barked as a fellow bowler hunched over to fling
a hard plastic ball across the faded green sod of the Oxnard-Joslyn
Lawn Bowlers Club.</LD>
<LD>   "He should be good--he was doing it on the Mayflower!" Pollock
cracked.</LD>
<TE>   Pollock's one-liners were nonstop, a jovial refrain for the aging
men and women who have made lawn bowling in Oxnard part of their
lives and, in some cases, their deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1994 the club at Wilson Park has been more than a patch of
green where some 80 members from across Ventura County can sharpen
their skills while getting some low-impact exercise. Wedged between a
senior center and a shuffleboard deck, it serves as a social
crossroads--a place where birthdays are marked, the sport's finer
points are pondered and a bottomless well of corny stories and
off-color jokes are shared.</TE>
<TE>   At the center of it all is a pastime that originated in ancient
Egypt, took root in Europe at least 900 years ago and continues to be
popular worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   The object of lawn bowling is simple: Roll a 3-pound ball, known
to devotees as a bowl, closer than other players to a smaller ball
called the jack.</TE>
<TE>   Amador Martinez, a stocky retired Defense Department worker with a
white cap pulled low over his eyes, is the Oxnard club's top player,
many members say.</TE>
<TE>   Sheepishly, he nodded. He is pretty good when he hits the green,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mental game and you have to have the right attitude for
it," Martinez said as he tucked his knees together, crouched and made
his bowl.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the green, his two teammates eyed the ball
closely and gauged its distance from the jack with a tape measure, an
essential accessory when a fraction of an inch can make the
difference between victory and defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Some 37,000 people in the U.S.--most of them retired--are among
the 4 million who play the game worldwide, said Joe Siegman, the
editor of Bowls Magazine, which is considered a must-read among
aficionados. Southern California is a lawn bowling hotbed, with three
dozen clubs.</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard, many members are in their late 70s and early 80s. They
talk of heart attacks, hip replacements, angioplasties, melanomas,
arthritic joints and other maladies of age. For weeks and sometimes
months at a time, bowlers have had to pull back from the club's
four-times-a-week competitions. But rarely does someone quit for
good.</TE>
<TE>   From time to time, members gather at their pink-and-white
clubhouse and travel en masse to a pal's funeral, an island of lawn
bowlers in their regulation whites amid a sea of mourners in black.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that part was kind of hokey at first," club president
Ken Barrabee said of the funeral tributes. "But then I realized how
important it is."</TE>
<TE>   A display case on a wall near the clubhouse kitchen is a memorial
to bowlers who have passed on. Against a field of green felt are blue
name tags with white lettering--one for each of the 25 members who
has died since the club began.</TE>
<TE>   Retired aerospace engineer Bill Taschek doesn't get depressed when
he glances over the names. At least they went, he said, with a legacy
of friendships formed at a time in life when some people shut
themselves off from the rest of the world.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all here to have fun and a good time," said Taschek, 74, a
ruddy-cheeked Oxnard resident who served as club president last year
when his predecessor had a heart attack. "You get a little bit of
exercise and a lot of fun. I gave up golf for this. Golf was bad for
my ego."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I am struck by the flexibility Rep. Elton Gallegly exhibits when it
comes to matters of principle.</LD>
<LD>   He signed on as a co-sponsor of the Shays-Meehan bill, the House
version of campaign finance reform, months ago, and declared his
position in statements and letters.</LD>
<LD>   But when the House leadership bottled it up in committee,
Gallegly's "strong support for campaign finance reform" was not
strong enough to move him to sign the petition to bring it to the
floor of the House for a vote, because "as a matter of principle, I
do not sign discharge petitions," even for a bill he co-sponsored.</LD>
<TE>   When the Enron debacle turned a spotlight on runaway campaign
contributions, other representatives came forward to move the bill
out of committee. It was debated long and hard on Feb. 13 and well
into the next morning and was passed with a comfortable margin.</TE>
<TE>   But Gallegly reversed his position, shifted his principles and
voted against the bill he had co-sponsored. In other words, he felt
that no reform was better than his own bill.</TE>
<TE>   It would appear that Gallegly's "principles" can be adjusted to
suit the dictates of his party's leadership.</TE>
<TE>   If we are to believe the pronouncements of Speaker [Dennis]
Hastert last week about the significance of this vote, you and I have
just witnessed "Armageddon!" Wow! I never thought I'd live to see the
day.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Gallegly, nothing conceived by man is perfect or lasts
forever. Even something as simple as a zipper will break, but while
it lasts it sure beats the heck out of buttons!</TE>

<LD>I read with interest a letter to the editor by Jim McHarg of Thousand
Oaks, questioning a letter I sent out critical of Linda Parks. McHarg
stated that the letter was sent out using taxpayer funds. Perhaps a
closer examination of the facts is warranted.</LD>
<LD>   The letter is clearly marked as being paid for and sent by Randy
Hoffman for Supervisor, a fact McHarg failed to mention. Taxpayers
did not spend one cent on this mailing.</LD>
<LD>   I find it interesting that McHarg chose to question my letter of
support for Hoffman and not defend Parks' liberal record in Thousand
Oaks. There was no mention of the tens of thousands of dollars spent
on anger management training during Parks' term on the City Council,
nor was there any mention of her voting nine times out of 10 against
businesses wishing to locate in the Conejo Valley, costing us new
jobs in our community.</LD>
<TE>   Even more astonishing, McHarg doesn't stand up for the fact that
Parks' poor leadership has cost Thousand Oaks taxpayers over $1
million.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps next time, before leveling accusations, McHarg will read
his mail a little more closely.</TE>

<LD>David Murdock's claim that he is an environmentalist is absurd. And
his promise to keep agricultural land in farming should be viewed
with suspicion.</LD>
<LD>   In Hawaii, he paved over pineapple fields for luxury resorts. He
promised not to use the island's limited fresh water on his golf
courses. He broke his promise. In 1994, he illegally blocked public
access to a public trail on the island.</LD>
<LD>   Murdock's funneling of thousands of dollars to Randy Hoffman's and
Judy Mikels' campaigns is reason for alarm. Murdock doesn't care
about the public or the environment. It is likely that his candidates
don't either.</LD>
<TE>   Jeff Mikulina</TE>
<TE>   Director, Sierra Club,</TE>
<TE>   Hawaii Chapter</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County is on the auction block! Supervisorial District 2
and District 4 are now bearing price tags, courtesy of developer
David Murdock.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock claims that he is only interested in creating a "good
business climate" in Ventura County and cites Orange County as having
less bureaucratic hurdles. It might have less hurdles, but it also
has a great deal more concrete, thanks to rampant, unbridled
development. Murdock should know that the vast majority of county
residents don't want to emulate Orange County. We would rather remain
a green county instead of an Orange County/Los Angeles monolithic
look-alike with every city running together in one continuous traffic
tie-up.</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, Murdock and one of the chosen recipients of his
"generosity," Judy Mikels, are both out of step with Ventura County.
She stated that SOAR was not an issue in her district, yet Simi
Valley passed the initiative with the highest percentage of any area
in the county.</TE>
<TE>   We think that the wealthy few can gain disproportionate access and
influence, and therefore power, which adversely affects the interests
of society as a whole. By "buying" access and influence via Randy
Hoffman and Mikels (40% of the Board of Supervisors), Murdock is
blatantly identifying what direction he wants this county to travel
and what politicians he expects to help him to achieve that goal. A
strong hint of that direction was shown at a recent Hidden Valley
residents' meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock requested that they not vote on cityhood until after the
supervisorial election. Is this to ensure that the county political
climate will be receptive to the Murdock-desired "business" climate?</TE>
<TE>   It is no small coincidence that Murdock sought the assistance of
Supervisor Mikels (not his district, not his supervisor) when he
wanted an intervention with Ventura County planning on one of his
personal projects.</TE>
<TE>   She is well known for being receptive to out-of-county development
and business campaign contributions. At least the public has now been
given fair warning as to what we are letting ourselves in for if both
Mikels and Hoffman are elected.</TE>
<TE>   It is interesting to note that the companion to large, highly
suspect influence-buying donations, namely, mudslinging, has
apparently begun.</TE>
<TE>   First, one has Hoffman and Murdock's charge that Linda Parks
solicited Murdock for donations to her supervisor campaign. Now, with
convenient timing, three members of the Thousand Oaks City Council
are speaking darkly of a conspiracy, a political plot and bogus
violations of the Brown Act affecting the Western Plateau "deal."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has known Parks for any length of time is not going to
believe these accusations for a country second. But considering what
is at stake, the surfacing of these plain untruths is not surprising.</TE>
<TE>   Let's vote for supervisors who are not for sale and who will give
more than lip service to maintaining the unique qualities and
integrity of this beautiful agricultural county. That will be Parks
in District 2 and John Lane in District 4.</TE>

<HD>Preservation of Ormond Beach</HD>

<LD>The moment of truth for Ormond Beach is approaching. Stimulated by
the application for development of an auto storage facility on the
last acreage that provided convenient public access to the beach and
wetlands, the Oxnard City Council has requested a plan for the entire
1,200-acre area.</LD>
<LD>   This request makes good sense. You don't block off the entrance to
a wildlife refuge and a fine swimming and surfing beach before you
line up all the other pieces of the puzzle.</LD>
<LD>   Sadly, Ormond is an area that few county residents and even Oxnard
folk are familiar with because, like so many California wetlands, it
is hard to get to and consequently has not acquired the recognition
it surely deserves. In California, 95% of coastal wetlands has
disappeared. Before the days of the Coastal Act, this prime area of
south Oxnard was zoned for industrial development. The Edison
generating plant was there, as were the wastewater treatment plant
and Halaco, a metal conversion plant. A dozen benign and not-so
benign industries were built. Most recently, multiple car processing
facilities are seeking use of more land on Hueneme Road. Their
planned expansion would block access to the beach and wetlands.</LD>
<TE>   The local Coastal Plan has highlighted the wetlands for
protection, and the Coastal Conservancy has earmarked much of the
land for purchase. The conservancy made its first offer to the only
willing seller at the time, Edison, for its farmland and coastal
resources. Most recently, the Metropolitan Water District and the
city of Oxnard have listed most of their 300 acres for sale. The
conservancy is bidding on that land as well.</TE>
<TE>   Why should a wetland, especially such an unusual one as Ormond
Beach (the area contains all of the features of ancient wetlands such
as sand dunes, salt marshes, an estuary), be preserved and open to
public view? First, wetland plant communities are natural filters and
improve the quality of water runoff entering the sea. We swim and
fish in clearer water because of wetland cleansing. Second, the
estuaries feature a habitat and nursery for fish. Third, Ormond Beach
is on the Pacific flyway, so the migratory birds and locals swoop to
feed their hatching babies in the dunes. Remarkably, the Audubon
Society sighted 64 species in a three-hour period.</TE>
<TE>   We find endangered birds, fish and plants there in great numbers,
and more are discovered every year. Tourists should be drawn from
near and far once there is access to view the refuge and enjoy the
beach.</TE>
<TE>   The view of the sparkling ocean and the panorama of Anacapa Island
through the wetland grass or the egrets walking slowly and gracefully
in the shallow estuary inspire awe.</TE>
<TE>   I have dreamed of the day when Ormond Beach receives its rightful
status as a precious nature preserve, and the image of Oxnard's
southern shore rises to the level it deserves. Perhaps that day is
dawning.</TE>

<LD>Ron Bamieh will bring a breath of fresh air and some much-needed
direction to the Ventura County district attorney's office. I have
met Bamieh, and he will make our children and our families safe by
cracking down on violence, gangs and drugs. Bamieh cares about senior
citizens and will ensure their safety by prosecuting and preventing
elder abuse.</LD>
<LD>   He is reaching out to the different communities within the county
and wants to give them a voice in the district attorney's office
through his Community Prosecutor's Program.</LD>
<LD>   Bamieh has convinced me that he is the man for the job because of
his record. He is truly the tough, experienced prosecutor in this
race.</LD>
<TE>   Greg Totten and his cronies, on the other hand, have done nothing
but sling mud at Bamieh. I am always skeptical when candidates do not
have much to say about themselves and instead attack their opponents.
I have followed this race closely and am appalled at the way Totten
is running his campaign. Bamieh has had the chance to criticize
Totten for many of his actions, including trying to raise illegal
campaign funds from a nonprofit organization, selfishly using the
victim of a killing to gain political advantage and attempting to
steal this election with the help of Totten's old boy political
network.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh has chosen to look to the future and focus on issues that
are important to residents of Ventura County: crime, tough
prosecution and safety in our schools. If Totten wants to win a
campaign, he should address the issues people care about and stay
away from political trickery and mudslinging.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is so obvious that there is only one candidate for district
attorney. Although a good trial attorney, Ron Bamieh does not have
the experience it takes to run an office as large as the Ventura
County district attorney's office. He doesn't have the experience
with supervision or budget. Greg Totten does. Totten has trial
experience, supervision experience and budget experience. Totten also
has the desire and ability to make changes, if they are necessary and
good for the office as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   I work with both candidates. Totten is a good trial attorney; he
is a good supervisor; he was very well respected as the executive
director of the California District Attorneys Assn. for four years,
and he came back to Ventura to head the administrative and fiscal
division of the district attorney's office. He is currently the No. 2
person in charge of the office. How could you have any more
experience than that, other than being an elected district attorney?
Totten has that experience. Bamieh only has trial attorney
experience, no supervisory experience and no budget experience.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not quite sure how someone can be so sure he can keep an
office as large as this within budget with no budget experience. My
vote is for Totten. He has the experience and the knowledge that this
office needs.</TE>

<HD>Nurses Across State Cash In on Shortage</HD>
<DH>Health care: Signing bonuses, moving expenses and tuition
reimbursement are among the perks hospitals are using to lure them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Danielle Ortiz was finishing up nursing classes at Victor Valley
College last May, she had one ambitious goal: to land a job as a
labor and delivery nurse, a specialty slot not often handed to green
college graduates.</LD>
<LD>   Luckily for her, she was entering a booming nursing job market in
a state with one of the worst nursing shortages in the country. So
with very little work experience, she easily landed a job in the
field of her dreams--and collected a $2,000 sign-on bonus to boot.</LD>
<LD>   "They don't usually take people right out of college into certain
specialties," said Ortiz, 23. "But because of the shortage, they're
willing to try anything."</LD>
<TE>   This is the flip side of the nursing shortage: a health care
industry pulling out all the stops to recruit and educate nurses.
California hospitals are now offering sign-on bonuses of as much as
$15,000, as well as paying moving expenses, tuition for
baccalaureates and master's degrees and contributions to 401(k)
plans.</TE>
<TE>   "The competitive environment for hospitals hiring nurses is
unbelievable," said Jan Emerson, spokeswoman for the California
Healthcare Assn., a hospital trade group.</TE>
<TE>   NurseWeek, a California publication for nurses, is replete with
ads from hospitals offering hiring bonuses. In certain locations and
specialties especially short of nurses, signing on can add up to big
bucks.</TE>
<TE>   Recruiters at Redding Medical Center in Northern California offer
$15,000 to nurses with experience in critical care, cardiovascular
care or intensive care.</TE>
<TE>   "It depends on the type of specialty you're trying to recruit,"
said Carolyn Helfenstein, a Redding Medical spokeswoman. "[Nurses]
might not be as readily available as they would be in a metropolitan
area."</TE>
<TE>   Natividad Medical Center in Salinas offers $5,000 sign-on bonuses
for certain specialty positions because they require more training.
Since the cost of living in Monterey County is high, nurses get an
extra boost.</TE>
<TE>   "It is hard to get qualified nurses to come to our facility," said
Janine Bouyea, acting human resources administrator at Natividad. "We
offer a sign-on bonus to woo them."</TE>
<TE>   The hospital also offers to pay up to $5,000 in moving expenses
and full tuition if nurses go back to school in Monterey County.</TE>
<TE>   Some hospitals say they are able to recruit without offering
signing bonuses. "We've never had to pay people up front to come in
the door," said Janice Beuhler, director of work force planning at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and president of the Southern California
Assn. of Healthcare Recruiters.</TE>
<TE>   Beuhler said hiring bonuses sometimes cause resentment among
nurses already on staff.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't sit well for a nurse who's been with us for five years
when someone brand-new walks in and gets $5,000," she said.</TE>
<TE>   It also annoys nurses when new hires come in, take the signing
bonus, benefit from free specialty training, complete their
contractual stints of a couple years and leave for hospitals offering
yet another bonus and a larger salary.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Cedars pays for training programs and an on-site
bachelor's and master's program affiliated with Cal State L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Hiring incentives can sometimes even frustrate the new hires
themselves. Earlier this month, Frederick Brown, 36, quit his job as
an emergency room nurse at St. Luke's Medical Center in San Francisco
because he believed that, by taking a bonus and a free apartment for
three months, he ended up beholden to the hospital. He thought he had
little say in which shifts he worked and when.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time an industry is offering all this stuff to you, there has
to be a catch to it," said Brown, who now works as a nurse in Kansas
City.</TE>
<TE>   Public hospitals don't offer the same perks as private facilities,
but they do what they can. Los Angeles County facilities, for
example, offer all nurses 401(k) plans, specialty training and
scholarships, said Debi Popkins, director of nurse recruitment for
county hospitals and public health programs. These may not be fancy,
she said, but they help nurses who want to make a career at county
hospitals, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The benefit is not always on the front end," she said. "We know
you're a new nurse, but we want you to grow professionally....
Sometimes there's more of a retention incentive than a recruitment
incentive."</TE>
<TE>   Some hospitals go right to the source of new nurses and offer
financial support.</TE>
<TE>   To hospital administrators, it makes practical sense to donate
money for faculty salaries at local nursing schools. More instructors
mean bigger nursing classes. Bigger nursing classes mean more
graduates and a larger pool from which to hire.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser Permanente, California's largest HMO, has donated to local
schools for more than 10 years and last year donated about $500,000
to schools statewide, said Jim Anderson, a Kaiser spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   All that adds up to more opportunities for nurses.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything that relieves the nursing shortage helps us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the Healthcare Assn. of Southern California, a
regional trade group for hospitals, entered a $100,000 contract with
Careforce Consulting Group of South Pasadena to match hospitals with
nearby nursing schools. Through almost 25 partnerships in six
counties, the group has helped pay for 500 more students to attend
school and enter the job market. That amounts to 10% of last year's
nursing graduates in California.</TE>
<TE>   "The hospitals right now are so desperate from a work force
standpoint to educate nurses, they'll do anything to try to [help]
their local schools," said Carol Bradley, the founder of Careforce.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the nursing shortage must be addressed by nursing
schools, public hospitals and private hospitals working together,
Popkins said.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to try to form real partnerships so we can attract nurses
... so we're not robbing Peter to pay Paul," she said.</TE>

<LD>A 40-year-old man stabbed in what police described as a
domestic-violence attack at a Garden Grove motel died early Saturday
at UC Irvine Medical Center, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Whipple of Westminster was found lying with a stab wound to
his back on the balcony of a room at the Firestation Motel on Harbor
Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   He was found about 4:35 p.m. Friday, Garden Grove police said.</LD>
<TE>   Officers arrested the victim's girlfriend, Anna Marie Morgan, 27,
on suspicion of attempted murder, said Sgt. Mike Handfield.</TE>
<TE>   Police plan to ask prosecutors to seek murder charges against her,
the sergeant said.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan is being held at Central Women's Jail in lieu of $250,000
bail and is scheduled to appear in court Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Although domestic violence is more frequently carried out by men
against women, Morgan is the second woman arrested in a week in
connection with a domestic-violence killing.</TE>
<TE>   Marita Hootan of Villa Park was arrested Wednesday after her
husband was allegedly bludgeoned to death.</TE>

<LD>I love to hear the hills whisper, don't you? It's so much better than
when they're screaming, yelling and carrying on. Honestly, is there
anything worse than noisy hills?</LD>
<LD>   That's probably why builders chose Whispering Hills as the name
for a planned housing tract in South County. I saw a map of the
proposed tract and a new high school to be built near it, and on the
newspaper page it looked like a little piece of heaven.</LD>
<LD>   But then, right next to it--apparently less than a mile away--the
map showed a landfill. Back in Nebraska, we used to call those places
dumps. I don't know if the landfill is staying or going once people
move in, but I bet if it stays, the developers won't be touting it to
future residents.</LD>
<TE>   That's the kind of stuff that bugs me, especially living in a
county that abounds in housing developments with enticing names. What
if future developments were named in a way that explained to
prospective buyers exactly what life would be like?:</TE>
<TE>   Clattering Rails--From the moment your family moves into this
rustic country getaway, you'll feel like you're back in the 1870s.
Spacious three-bedroom homes, close to jobs and nearly encircled by
Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway tracks. If you're tired of
freeway noise, come on out and sample the terrifying sound of a train
whistle at any hour of the day or night. Pets not advised.</TE>
<TE>   Smoking Timbers--Hard by the Cleveland National Forest, this
community in east Orange County offers the usual amenities, plus the
ever-present threat of a fast-moving brush fire. Homes come with
three-car garages (got an SUV?) and 300 feet of high-pressure hoses
with adjustable nozzles.</TE>
<TE>   Landing Point--Experience life in the heart of Orange County with
a bird's-eye view of an international airport. From your balcony,
watch jets take off and land as you forget your cares in this
suburban oasis. Dislike pointless conversation? There'll be none,
because you won't be able to hear yourself think, let alone your
housemates. Easy terms available.</TE>
<TE>   Sump Towne--We like what we've done with these spiffy one- and
two-bedroom condos that run along one of the county's most polluted
streams. Outer walls have been affixed with additional layers of
siding in an effort to minimize the incredible smell emanating from
the runoff. These are designed as starter residential units, because
it's highly unlikely anyone will be able to stand it for more than
six months.</TE>
<TE>   Itchy Fingers by the Sea--An experimental village in which
residents are allowed to carry firearms. The clubhouse features both
upstairs and downstairs firing ranges. Regularly scheduled social
events will include nightly anger-management classes. No felons,
please.</TE>
<TE>   Sardine Villa Pointe--See if you can cram your family into one of
our units. You'll be amazed how we put 150 single-family homes onto a
former Kmart parking lot. Your youngsters will be able to leave their
bikes at home and walk to one of the three new schools opening next
fall, with projected enrollments of 4,200 each and one teacher for
every 73.2 students.</TE>
<TE>   Biker Hideaway--The first of its kind in the nation, this idyllic
retreat caters to people in the federal Witness Protection Program.
As such, there is a 50% set-aside for former Hells Angels members who
rat out their former drug-running pals. Twisting walkways, flowered
gardens and 24-hour armed guards in turrets distinguish this from
run-of-the-mill developments. No children, unless they're also in the
program. Use your real name and receive a security-deposit waiver.</TE>
<TE>   Shifting Sands--Sign our lease and the beach is a half-mile from
your doorstep--for now. A major fault line will make insurance hard

<DL></DL>
<LD>Walter Bolden, 76, a drummer and composer who played with many jazz
greats in the 1950s, died Feb. 7 of cancer at a hospital in New York
City.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Hartford, Conn., Bolden saw his career get a jump-start
one night in 1950, when saxophonist Stan Getz went to Hartford and
played with a pickup band at the Sundown Club--with Bolden on drums.</LD>
<LD>   Getz liked the band, which included pianist Horace Silver, so much
that he made recordings with the group and took it on tour.</LD>
<TE>   Bolden, who had studied at the Hartt School of Music in Hartford,
moved to New York, where he became a fixture in the jazz scene.</TE>
<TE>   He recorded with Coleman Hawkins, Jackie McLean, Junior Mance and
others. He played on Gerry Mulligan's first album in 1951 and
composed music that was recorded by Howard McGhee and Arthur Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   Bolden also taught master classes at the University of Hartford
and worked on the staff of Jazzmobile, a project that takes jazz to
New York City streets and parks.</TE>

<HD>Pool Maintenance Measure on Fillmore Ballot</HD>
<DH>Election: The tax would generate an estimated $57,000
annually for a new community facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARRI KARUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The tiles of the community pool at Fillmore High School were cracked.
The ladders were rickety, and the plaster at the bottom of the
35-year-old basin was corroded.</LD>
<LD>   So last year, citing a number of health and safety issues, Ventura
County environmental health officials ordered the pool closed. It has
been shut ever since.</LD>
<LD>   The city of Fillmore wants to give residents a chance to get back
in the swim. It is asking local voters to approve Measure Q--a parcel
tax that would finance the maintenance of a new swimming pool next to
the high school, on 1st Street between A Street and Central Avenue.
Money to build the pool would come out of the city's redevelopment
budget.</LD>
<TE>   The pool "was not maintained to the level that it should have been
maintained," said Cindy Blatt, the high school's swim coach. "That's
probably why we have the problems."</TE>
<TE>   If approved on the March 5 ballot, the measure would assess local
property owners up to $15 annually, effective fiscal 2002-2003. The
owners of apartment complexes and other multifamily buildings would
be charged up to $15 annually for each housing unit.</TE>
<TE>   The tax would be assessed for a period of time determined by the
City Council, and generate an estimated $57,000 annually.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say the cost is worth it, especially in the summer
when temperatures often exceed 100 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "Not having a community pool has probably taken a toll on the kids
as well as the families who have to live with those kids," Deputy
City Manager Tom Ristau said.</TE>
<TE>   The city is negotiating with Fillmore Unified School District to
buy a 1.5-acre site, which includes the closed pool and four tennis
courts, for $305,000. If voters approve the measure, the city would
tear out the pool and build a new 6,225-square-foot pool in its
place.</TE>
<TE>   The $2-million construction cost would include a 2,000-square-foot
building for lockers, showers, restrooms and equipment, such as
filtration devices and starting blocks for swim competitions.</TE>
<TE>   Work would begin this summer and be finished by summer 2003.</TE>
<TE>   If the measure fails, the pool will remain closed.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been in a position to fund the replacement and ongoing
maintenance of the pool for the entire community," said Fillmore
Unified School District Supt. Mario Contini.</TE>
<TE>   Since the pool was closed, the Fillmore High swim team has used
the pool at Santa Paula High School.</TE>
<TE>   Under an agreement with the city, the school district allowed the
Parks and Recreation Department to use the pool for swim lessons and
other programs. If voters pass the tax measure, the city would own
the pool but the district probably would continue to use it for
physical education classes.</TE>

<HD>Tet Parade: Revelry and Reminders</HD>
<DH>Celebration: Festival marks a new year, affirms culture and

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The largest Vietnamese American community in the country welcomed the
Lunar New Year on Saturday with a festival and parade in Orange
County, mixing pageantry, cultural traditions and history.</LD>
<LD>   "It kind of gives you a feeling of being in another country," said
Sherry Nuzzo of Tustin, who was watching the Tet parade in
Westminster's Little Saigon with her son Brian and his two children.
The annual events continue to grow, organizers said, underscoring the
increasing influence of the local Vietnamese community, which numbers
more than 230,000 in Southern California. The Westminster parade had
62 entries this year, the most in its eight-year history, said the
parade association's vice president, Dan Charles Makaena.</LD>
<LD>   Tet Nguyen Dan, known as Tet, is a time for Vietnamese families to
renew their cultural bonds. .</LD>
<TE>   "I want my kids to know their roots," said Thuy Vo, a 34-year-old
mother from Fountain Valley who brought four of her youngest children
to watch the parade.</TE>
<TE>   About 10,000 people attended the Bolsa Avenue parade, a familiar
procession of high school bands, political dignitaries, siren-blaring
firetrucks and colorful dragon costumes.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the dragon dance brings good luck," a female announcer
quipped over the speakers, "go out and buy lottery tickets today."</TE>
<TE>   But amid the fanfare and cheers, there was also a somber reminder
of the history that binds the two countries.</TE>
<TE>   Interspersed among bouncing high school cheerleaders and women
wearing colorful ao dais, the traditional Vietnamese dress, were
military vehicles and marching veterans of the Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   The remnants of a C-130 Army helicopter passed by, festooned with
balloons and the flags of the United States and former South Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   James Zimmer of Santa Ana watched the procession Saturday with a
serious expression.</TE>
<TE>   "I am here to represent a lot of the soldiers who didn't come
home," the 47-year-old Vietnam War veteran said. "The parade shows
the unity of the American and Vietnamese people."</TE>
<TE>   The former soldier stood ramrod straight and saluted the military
officials parading down the avenue. An officer sitting atop a
convertible spotted Zimmer's frayed Army jacket and asked, "What
company?"</TE>
<TE>   "Third, 64th," shouted Zimmer, who was in Vietnam from 1974 to
1978. That is 64th Army division, Third Bravo Company, he explained.</TE>
<TE>   Coming to the parade and seeing a thriving Vietnamese American
population made him feel as though the years he spent in Vietnam
served a purpose, Zimmer saidA few miles from Zimmer, hundreds of
people were savoring Vietnamese barbecue and browsing through
carnival booths set up in Garden Grove Park.</TE>
<TE>   The three-day event, which opened Friday, was expected to draw a
record 15,000 people, according to police officials.</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds will go to local charities.</TE>
<TE>   In years past, because of divisions within the community, the
festival was split into two competing events. Last November, a
Vietnamese student group won the sole rights to run the festival from
the Garden Grove City Council.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict was an unfortunate chapter for the community, said
Nicole Nguyen, a vice president of the Union of Vietnamese Students
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   But she added: "We hope we'll move in a more united way and
support one another."</TE>

<CX>   Tet Parade--A story in Saturday's California section on Vietnamese
New Year festivities quoted a man who said he had served in the Vietnam
War between 1974 and 1978. U.S. combat troops were withdrawn in 1973, and
the remaining troops and personnel departed in 1975 with the fall of
Saigon. The story also misidentified a military helicopter in the parade.
The aircraft was a Huey.</CX>

<HD>Truth Dims the Legend of Outlaw Queen Belle Starr</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CECILIA RASMUSSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eight lovers, they say, combed her wavy black hair.</LD>
<LD>   Eight men knew the feel of her dark velvet waist.</LD>
<LD>   Eight men heard the sound of her tan leather skirt.</LD>
<TE>   Eight men heard the bark of the guns that she wore.</TE>
<TE>   --19th century anonymous verse</TE>
<TE>   written about Belle Starr</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Amid the tangle of fact and myth surrounding the infamous ''Queen
of Outlaws'' Belle Starr, one thing is clear: Without knowing it, she
staked a claim on the American imagination.</TE>
<TE>   The notion of a female outlaw in the Victorian 19th century made
Belle Starr the belle of the American West, however dark her deeds.</TE>
<TE>   Since her death in 1889, she has spawned so many legends, books
and movies that the truth has often been lost in the fog.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, the bandit queen's myth has lost much of its luster
as historians continue to dig into her past, discovering a woman
whose lawlessness was inflated by myth makers. In spite of the outlaw
company she sometimes kept, her sole conviction was for horse theft,
and she died far more violently than she lived.</TE>
<TE>   Part of her claim on history's imagination was established in 19th
century Los Angeles, where Belle's outlaw husband, Jim Reed, worked
in a gambling house. Belle contented herself with rearing their
daughter, Pearl, and bearing a son, Eddie. The Reeds found time for
family excursions north to Paso Robles, supposedly visiting or just
missing some professional colleagues named Jesse and Frank James.</TE>
<TE>   Belle the infamous outlaw is one of the most-told tales of the Old
West. But the truth is far less entertaining.</TE>
<TE>   Belle was born Myra Maybelle Shirley. Her father was a Missouri
hotel owner; her mother was a Hatfield, of the notorious feuding
Hatfields and McCoys.</TE>
<TE>   During the Civil War, when Belle was a teenager, her elder
brother, Bud, joined Quantrill's Raiders, a gang of Confederate
''bushwhackers.''</TE>
<TE>   Quantrill shot or hanged Unionist farmers and burned their farms,
killed prisoners, scalped dead Union soldiers and sported necklaces
made of severed ears and fingers. He also mentored outlaws like
''Bloody Bill'' Anderson and the Jesse James-Cole Younger-Jim Reed
gangs, who would figure in Belle's life.</TE>
<TE>   The gang's skills, honed by four years of guerrilla battle, turned
to robbery: They are said to have emptied nine banks and eight trains
and killed 32 people.</TE>
<TE>   Reputedly, Belle strapped on a six-shooter and crossed the
Missouri-Kansas line disguised as a man to join the guerrillas. But
that is merely myth, according to recent research.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting the Gangs</TE>
<TE>   It was during the war, however, that Belle got to know some of the
gangs, before her brother was killed and she moved to Texas with her
family in 1864. That same year, Belle met Cole Younger, a God-fearing
man who reputedly carried a Bible in spite of his crimes. He dropped
by their Texas ranch to pay his respects.</TE>
<TE>   But it's mere myth that Belle and Younger hit it off and had an
affair that produced a daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, after a bank robbery in Missouri in 1866, some of
the gang headed to Texas to hide out at the Shirley family ranch. It
was then that Belle married a horseback gangster and rustler named
Jim Reed, whom she had a schoolgirl crush on before the war. He was
the first of her four husbands and many lovers. A month later, she
was pregnant with Reed's child, Pearl.</TE>
<TE>   The Belle myth depicts her as buying a livery stable in Dallas,
which she used as a front for dealing stolen horses. Popular history
envisioned her as a dance-hall hostess who dealt faro in a saloon,
drank at the bar with the boys and rode sidesaddle at breakneck speed
in pursuit of danger, money and excitement.</TE>
<TE>   There is a nugget of truth here: Belle did ride sidesaddle and she
was a crack shot. She also dressed in a black velvet riding habit, a
plumed hat and two pistols, with belts of cartridges crisscrossing
her hips.</TE>
<TE>   But she was not the brains of the various James-Reed-Younger
gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Among many Belle biographers and fabulists, the first to explode
the myths was Glenn Shirley--no relation to Belle--in his book,
''Belle Starr and Her Times: The Literature, the Facts and the
Legends.''</TE>
<TE>   Belle, in fact, graduated from Missouri's Carthage Female Academy,
a genteel institution her father helped to found. The piano-playing,
Yankee-hating Belle did scout for her guerrilla brother from time to
time during the war, before the family moved to Texas. She also loved
to cook and traded recipes with neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   The war over, the James-Younger-Reed gangs were unable to return
home to peaceful pursuits in Missouri. Amnesty had been proclaimed
for Union guerrillas--pillagers, arsonists and murderers--but not for
Confederate guerrillas, who were subject to arrest for war crimes.</TE>
<TE>   To make a living, the Jameses, Youngers and Reeds began stealing
horses and cattle before they switched to stealing cash--including
from the railroads. Unlike the version recounted in last year's film
''American Outlaws,'' the railroads did not push them into a life of
crime by laying tracks across their farms.</TE>
<TE>   Coming to Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   In 1867, Belle's husband murdered a man in Arkansas. With the law
on their heels, the newlyweds and their infant daughter headed for
California, he on horseback and she following in a stagecoach. They
met up in Los Angeles, where he found a job as a professional gambler
in a saloon, shedding lawmen in the frontier hubbub. Here, Belle's
husband spent little time at home with his new family, preferring
horse racing and gambling.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after they arrived in Los Angeles, Belle and her husband
evidently took a trip up the coast to Drury Woodson James' spa named
Hot Sulphur Springs. Woodson's nephews were supposedly there too:
Frank and Jesse James.</TE>
<TE>   By February 1871, while still living in Los Angeles, Belle gave
birth to James Edwin Reed, whom she and her husband called Eddie. The
following month, the feds were after Jim Reed for passing counterfeit
money. Then they learned he was wanted for murder in Arkansas and had
a price on his head.</TE>
<TE>   Reed fled Los Angeles alone on horseback, while Belle eluded
authorities by dressing Pearl as a boy, knowing that lawmen were
looking for a woman with a little girl and a baby.</TE>
<TE>   The End of Jim Reed</TE>
<TE>   Belle and the children settled down with Reed's family in
Missouri, while her husband took off with the granddaughter of a
prominent Dallas family. He continued his life of crime with his
pals, robbing and killing until a lawman caught up with him and
killed him in 1874.</TE>
<TE>   Six years later, the widowed Belle married Bruce Younger, another
member of the Younger gang. It lasted three weeks, for reasons
unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly thereafter, outlaw Sam Starr went to the altar with
Belle--and then to the courthouse. He and his bride were arrested for
horse theft--the first record of any lawbreaking on her part. In
1882, the famous hanging Judge Isaac Parker--who sent 87 men to the
gallows--sentenced her to nine months in the Women's Workhouse in
Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   In 1886, the 38-year-old Belle and Sam were again arrested near
their farm on the Canadian River in what is now Oklahoma and charged
with stealing horses, harboring fugitives and robbing a wealthy
farmer. They were acquitted.</TE>
<TE>   Belle's glamorized saga as an outlaw queen ended there. The rest
of her short life was simple tragedy. The evidently happy marriage
with the felonious Sam Starr ended in a shootout with a lawman at a
Christmas party. Starr and the lawman killed each other.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two-plus years of her life, she took lovers--Jack
Spaniard, Jim French, Blue Duck--who were killed or simply picked up
and left her. At last, her beauty ravaged, she proposed marriage to
Sam Starr's adopted brother, Jim July Starr, who was part Cherokee
Indian and 15 years her junior. He accepted, and for several months
they farmed their land near the town of Porum, in Oklahoma's Indian
territory.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 3, 1889--two days before Belle's 41st birthday--she was
riding home from a neighbor's house when a killer blasted her off her
horse as she ate a piece of corn bread, then shot her again after she
fell. She died from two shotgun wounds: in the back and neck and in
the shoulder and face.</TE>
<TE>   Her killer was never brought to justice.</TE>
<TE>   Although she had a few enemies, including her children from time
to time, legend has it that coldblooded killer Edgar Watson, one of
her sharecroppers, murdered her, fearing that she would tell
authorities he was an escaped murderer from Florida with a price on
his head.</TE>
<TE>   Belle was buried at her home, her tombstone engraved with a bell,
a star and a horse. It was purchased by her daughter, Pearl, with
money she had earned in a brothel--the career she ended up pursuing.</TE>
<TE>   The West, the cradle of legend, gave Belle a reputation the facts
could not support: that of a female outlaw. But it also gave her more
fame in death than she ever had in life.</TE>

<HD>Peter Voulkos, 78; Reinvented Ceramics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter Voulkos, the artist who launched an American revolution in
ceramic sculpture, died early Saturday morning of an apparent heart
attack. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Voulkos, who lived in Oakland, died in Bowling Green, Ohio, where
he had just finished teaching a ceramics workshop at Bowling Green
State University.</LD>
<LD>   Voulkos was the fountainhead of a new strain in American art. When
he began, pottery was considered a minor decorative art or a
hobbyist's craft. Six short years after the Montana-born artist moved
to Los Angeles, however, his work was the subject of a solo
exhibition at New York's Museum of Modern Art.</LD>
<TE>   Working from an unassuming classroom studio in the old Los Angeles
County Art Institute in 1954, Voulkos was the pivot around which an
important group of ambitious young artists turned, establishing what
became known as Otis Clay, the first art movement of national
importance to originate in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "Peter opened a door," said Manhattan gallerist and ceramics
historian Garth Clark, who featured Voulkos' work in "A Century of
Ceramics," a landmark 1979 book and exhibition at the Everson Museum
in Syracuse, N.Y. "He removed ceramics from the death grip of good
taste, which is what the decorative arts tradition had been."</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Price, Voulkos' former student and today the most
important direct heir to his ceramics legacy, once explained the
significance of his teacher's career. "In one way or another he
influenced everyone who makes art out of clay," Price told The Times
in 1999. "He is the most important person in clay of the 20th
century." When Voulkos was hired to teach ceramics at the County Art
Institute--later renamed the Otis Art Institute--by its director,
Millard Sheets, in 1954, he arrived to find a classroom outfitted
with little more than a table and a working sink.</TE>
<TE>   Voulkos and student Paul Soldner built several prototypes of
pottery kick-wheels from scratch. Soldner's welded X-frame kick-wheel
became the California classroom standard, while Voulkos' ceramics
changed the direction of the art.</TE>
<TE>   The summer before, Voulkos had gone to teach a traditional
ceramics course at North Carolina's now-legendary Black Mountain
College, where he worked in a heady, experimental atmosphere
alongside painters Josef Albers and Robert Rauschenberg, composer
John Cage, choreographer Merce Cunningham and other avant-garde
artists. They provided contacts for a subsequent visit to New York
City, where he met several Abstract Expressionist painters, including
fellow Westerner Jackson Pollock. Back in L.A., Voulkos began to
dismantle ceramic tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Without a studio of his own, he persuaded Sheets to allow him to
keep the ceramics classroom open 24 hours a day. Hierarchical
distinctions between teacher and students began to dissolve, replaced
by camaraderie and mutual experimentation.</TE>
<TE>   Few women were allowed into the boisterous ranks of the group,
which centered on Voulkos, Soldner, Mac McCloud, Billy Al Bengston,
Michael Frimkess, John Mason, Kenneth Price, Jerry Rothman and Henry
Take- moto, many of whom would develop careers of distinction.</TE>
<TE>   Typical of the raucous tenor was Voulkos' dismissive statement as
a disappointed juror at the fifth Miami National Exhibition (1957),
which caused an uproar: Ceramics, he declared, needed "a kick in the
pants" to pull it out of the doldrums.</TE>
<TE>   "I never intended on being revolutionary," Voulkos once insisted.
"There was a certain energy around L.A. at the time, and I liked the
whole milieu."</TE>
<TE>   Before L.A., Voulkos had been an award-winning potter in the
traditional manner, but now he was busy kicking--and kicking hard.</TE>
<TE>   In place of the traditional potter's concern for volume and
lightness, he pursued mass and weight. Rather than integrate surface
decoration and form in a seamless, unified manner, he set them
against one another. Asymmetry replaced symmetry. When a bowl was
pierced with holes and turned upside down to stand on its thickened
rim, function went out the window. Everybody else was after
simplified classical beauty, so Voulkos went for ugly.</TE>
<TE>   Size began to matter, too. With Mason he built a 7-foot-tall,
walk-in updraft kiln--one of the largest in the country. Combining
wheel-thrown and slab-built forms, he assembled sculptures as tall as
a standing man.</TE>
<TE>   Voulkos' work was soon making a stir in both the sequestered world
of ceramics and the larger art world. Fred Marer, a Los Angeles
college professor who put together a major ceramics collection now
housed at Scripps College in Claremont, began collecting his work in
1955. At the International Ceramics Exhibition in Cannes, France,
that year, Voulkos was the only American to win a gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   His first L.A. solo exhibition was at the Felix Landau Gallery in
1956, and the following year he was invited to participate in the
first national conference of the American Craft Council. In 1958 his
work was the subject of a solo show at the Pasadena Art Museum (now
the Norton Simon Museum), and in 1959 his stoneware sculpture "5,000
Feet" was chosen for a purchase prize at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art's annual survey of local artists. The sole juror was
David Smith, the most important sculptor of the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   In February 1960, Voulkos had a solo exhibition in the Penthouse
Gallery at New York's Museum of Modern Art, underlining the sudden
maturity of clay as an artist's medium. Writing in the New York
Times, Dore Ashton, doyenne of New York School art critics, praised
the sculptures' "virile images, ranging from boulder-like clusters to
complex open-and-closed pieces that have the dynamic rhythms of
dances."</TE>
<TE>   Voulkos was born Panagiotis Harry Voulkos to Greek immigrant
parents on Jan. 29, 1924, in Bozeman, Mont. After graduating from
high school he worked in Portland, Ore., as a molder apprentice
making engine castings for ships. Drafted in 1943, he served three
years in the Pacific as an airplane gunner in the Army Air Corps.</TE>
<TE>   From 1946 to 1951 he studied art on the GI Bill at Montana State
University. As a student he won first prize for pottery at the
Montana State Fair. It was the first of many awards, which included
the Rodin Prize (1959), a Guggenheim Fellowship (1984), the
Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement from the College
Art Assn. (1997), and honorary doctorates from four American art
schools.</TE>
<TE>   In 1951 Voulkos entered graduate school at the California College
of Arts and Crafts in Oakland. After graduating in 1952, he and his
new wife, Margaret Cone, moved to Helena, Mont., where Voulkos
managed a pottery production center.</TE>
<TE>   There he met Japanese master potter Shoji Hamada, historian Soetsu
Yanagi and the influential English potter Bernard Leach. The
expressiveness of Leach's work would prove decisive for Voulkos'
later direction, although Leach's commitment to traditional forms
gave the young American something to push against.</TE>
<TE>   With several years of skillful pottery production under his belt,
Voulkos had the means to choreograph his energetic building, cutting
and tearing of clay, together with a vigorous, painterly use of
glazes.</TE>
<TE>   One result was sculptural forms that recalled the dynamism of
Abstract Expressionist painting. And, like many of his New York
School compatriots, he also developed a reputation as a boisterous,
demanding hard drinker, for whom the lure of Scotch and cocaine was
intense.</TE>
<TE>   The revolutionary work Voulkos and his colleagues produced in Los
Angeles has come to be called Otis Clay--although, ironically, a
falling-out with the school's director, Sheets, over the raucous
direction of the ceramics program led to Voulkos' firing in May 1959,
before the school took the Otis name. Voulkos moved to Oakland, where
he lived for the next 40 years, to teach at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to ceramics, Voulkos made paintings and bronze
sculptures, although they never approached the significance of his
work in clay.</TE>
<TE>   Voulkos is survived by his wife, Ann Adair Voulkos; their son,
Aris; and a daughter, Pier, from his first marriage. A memorial
service in Oakland is pending.</TE>

<HD>Guenter Wand, 90; Directed German Orchestras</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>German conductor Guenter Wand, who directed orchestras in Hamburg and
Cologne and appeared with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, has died.
He was 90.</LD>
<LD>   Wand died Thursday at his home in Ulmiz, Switzerland, according to
Norddeutscher Rundfunk, the German broadcasting company whose
symphony orchestra he was associated with for the last two decades.
It did not give the cause of his death.</LD>
<LD>   Born Jan. 7, 1912, in the western Germany town of Elberfeld, Wand
studied philosophy in Cologne before turning to music. At age 20, the
opera in the city of Wuppertal took him on as composer and director.</LD>
<TE>   Wand led the Mozarteum Orchestra in Salzburg in 1944 and 1945, and
in the months after the end of World War II arranged a revue with the
orchestra for American troops. He returned to Germany in fall 1945
and the following year was appointed musical director for Cologne,
focusing on the city's Guerzenich Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   Wand, whose repertoire centered on Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner and
Schubert, moved to Switzerland after retiring from the Cologne post
in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1982, he became head of the NDR radio symphony orchestra in
Hamburg, a post he held for nine years.</TE>
<TE>   Wand made his U.S. debut in January 1989, conducting four concerts
with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   He insisted on five four-hour rehearsals of every program, more
than double the norm.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, his recordings had been from live performances
rather than the studio, and he had not allowed retakes to be patched
over troublesome spots, a common practice in classical music.</TE>
<TE>   "In music, as in life, lying is the beginning of all vice," Wand
told Gramophone magazine in October.</TE>
<TE>   He was made honorary director for life of the Hamburg orchestra.</TE>

<DH>Behavior: Adults-only sex tours detail the mating habits
and sexual talents of animals at the San Francisco Zoo. They are a
perpetual Valentine's Day sellout.</DH>

<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Josh Woolley and Courtney Wusthoff were at the San Francisco Zoo for
one reason Saturday: sex. And they would not go home disappointed.</LD>
<LD>   Now in its 13th year, the zoo's annual series of adults-only sex
tours is a perpetual Valentine's Day sellout. The $50 tour includes a
narrated trolley car ride through the zoo, a short presentation on
sexual evolution, and a pet-the-animals reception complete with
champagne and chocolate and Frank Sinatra tunes.</LD>
<LD>   "I talk dirty to perfect strangers," said tour guide Jane Tollini
by way of introduction. "And you are some kinky, abhorrent devils
that would come out here at 9 a.m. on a Saturday for this."</LD>
<TE>   Visitors don't actually get to see zoo animals doing the deed. But
they hear about it in exquisite detail, thanks to Tollini, the zoo's
penguin keeper and founder of the tours.</TE>
<TE>   Tollini, a grandmother and 20-year zoo veteran, offers an
enthusiastic narrative on the mating habits and sexual talents of
each species:</TE>
<TE>   River otters mate in a graceful water ballet, while chimpanzees
get together for days and days of sex. Zebras don't have time for
anything but a quickie lest they fall prey to hyenas. Lions can do it
50 times in 24 hours. Koalas only do it for 40 seconds at a time,
just three times a year.</TE>
<TE>   And eagles mate midair, plummeting toward the earth. They separate
just moments before hitting the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "I love animal sex trivia, and even I learned something," said
Woolley, a graduate student in neuroscience at UC San Francisco. The
tour was a Valentine's Day surprise from Wusthoff, a fellow medical
student.</TE>
<TE>   Jim and Linda Celrod of Danville, Calif., took the tour last year.
This year they brought along a video camera and their neighbors,
Kathy and Bob Kindred.</TE>
<TE>   "Like anything else, it's all in the presentation," Jim Celrod
said about Tollini. "She's a hoot."</TE>
<TE>   As the trolley winds its way among the zoo's exhibits, another zoo
staffer in a golf cart leads the way, warning parents with small
children along the path that what's about to come over the
loudspeaker might not be for them.</TE>
<TE>   Rolly, the pygmy hippo, couldn't seem to get his groove on with
female pen mate Polly for 20 years. When Polly finally died--"from
sheer frustration," Tollini said--Rolly got a new companion named
Agnes. Now he never misses an opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   The orangutans in the zoo are given birth control pills, just like
humans. And apes can mate swinging from the trees, which Tollini
advises her audience not to attempt on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Zakalik and Susan Malinowski, both physicians visiting from
Detroit, wondered aloud whether such a tour would go over well at the
zoo back home.</TE>
<TE>   "We laughed the whole way," said Malinowski, who found out about
the tour over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't romantic," said Kristin Lang, a Web developer from San
Francisco. "But it was funny and lewd in a very San Francisco way."</TE>

<LD>Skip Bayless in the San Jose Mercury News, on improving the Golden
State Warriors: "I floated the idea in December while serving as a
guest host on KNBR. I asked the audience to give me one good reason
why Warriors' management shouldn't give Rick Barry a chance to coach
the team.</LD>
<LD>   "The lines lit up the way the scoreboard did in 1975, when Barry
led the team to the NBA championship. In three hours I didn't hear
from a single caller opposed to the idea.</LD>
<LD>   "My conclusion: What would owner Chris Cowan have to lose except
one more game? If nothing else, more fans would buy tickets or watch
televised games just to see if Barry lived up--or down--to his
reputation as one of the top 50 players--and jerks--of all time. At
least it would be intriguing."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Barry: "[He] has long had a way of rubbing people the wrong
way. Maybe some can't forgive him for the arrogance he showed as a
player and as an analyst.</TE>
<TE>   "But wouldn't you love to see how the living dead who play for the
Warriors would respond to a little ego-puncturing, eye-opening
arrogance from a 6-foot-7 force field who looks like he could still
play?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

the Lakers?</TE>

<TE>   Not the best in show: A sampling of David Letterman's "Top 10
Signs Your Dog Will Not Win the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show":</TE>
<TE>   * "His toupee keeps falling off."</TE>
<TE>   * "Dog nearly obscured by a cloud of fleas."</TE>
<TE>   "His bone structure would be considered outstanding if he were a
cat."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thin Air? Mark Kreidler of the Sacramento Bee, commenting on
Michael Jordan, whose Washington Wizards were routed, 109-93,
Thursday by the Kings: "Watching Jordan these days is a gamelong
exercise in unfulfilled anticipation. It's four quarters of waiting
for the highlight play that never arrives. Jordan could score 44
points on you, and later you might find yourself struggling to recall
any two of them in particular."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FYI: The 1934 Los Angeles Angels were chosen as the best minor
league team ever, according to baseball historians Bill Weiss and
Marshall Wright.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels won the Pacific Coast League championship with a record
of 137-50, .733, finishing 351/2 games ahead of the second-place
team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's madness: From the Caught on the Fly column in the Sporting
News: "You can bet CBS is casting a very wary eye on the March
Madness bracket, as East vs. Midwest is etched into one Final Four
half, meaning runaway trains Duke and Kansas, the slam-dunk top seeds
in those regions, are on course to collide, no foolin', a coupla days
before the April 1 national cham-peen-ship tilt."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: No. 73. No other Los Angeles Laker has ever had a
jersey number even in the 60s.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Desperate to beat its archrival, a Scottish rowing
team is going all out. It is practicing in the nude. Robert Gordon
University has not defeated Aberdeen University in the race's
seven-year history.</TE>
<TE>   The adventurous rowers--four men, four women and a female
cox--hope the plan will toughen them (brrr!) before they face
Aberdeen again March 2.</TE>

<DH>Jeff Gordon, 30, Already Has a Place Among NASCAR's
All-Time Greats</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Retired Richard Petty and the late Dale Earnhardt have their seven
Winston Cup championships, and Petty has his seemingly unattainable
200 wins, but the best stock car driver who ever pulled into victory
lane may be starting today's Daytona 500 from the inside of the
second row.</LD>
<LD>   Jeff Gordon has accomplished more, in such a short time and at
such a young age, than any of the legendary icons of NASCAR who have
raced from the sandy ruts of Daytona's beach course to the high banks
of Daytona International Speedway.</LD>
<LD>   He is only 30, yet he already has four Winston Cup titles and is
favored to win his fifth as the 36-race 2002 season gets underway
today. When they were 30, Petty had two and Earnhardt one.</LD>
<TE>   He has already won 58 races and 39 poles in only 293 races over
nine seasons. He is seventh in career Winston Cup victories.
Earnhardt, who is sixth, needed 676 races to win his 76. Many of
Petty's 200 victories were made in an era in which there were as many
as 61 races in a season, nearly twice as many as in Gordon's time.</TE>
<TE>   No one with 50 victories or more has a winning percentage as high
as Gordon's 19.8. Petty's is 17.0 and Earnhardt's 11.2.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon is the only one to be named American Driver of the Year
four times, an award that includes Indy car, sports car, midget,
sprint car and drag race drivers as well as NASCAR. His career
winnings of $45.7 million are No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   When he won the 1997 Daytona 500, he was its youngest winner, 25
years 6 months 12 days. He won his second in 1999 in his seventh try.
It took Petty nine years to win two and it took Earnhardt 20 years
before he won his first and only one.</TE>
<TE>   "So much emphasis is put on the Daytona 500 because it is our
Super Bowl, World Series and Olympics all combined that you have to
remember that this is only one of 36 points races," said Gordon as
crew chief Robbie Loomis was putting final touches on his No. 24
Chevrolet Monte Carlo. The car has a special paint scheme celebrating
DuPont's 200th anniversary and DuPont's chief executive officer, Chad
Holliday, will serve as today's grand marshal.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wants to win this race because of the prestige and it
also provides a jump-start to the new season, but you don't
necessarily need a good finish here to win the championship."</TE>
<TE>   A case in point is last year, when Gordon finished 34th before
rallying to win Winston Cup No. 4.</TE>
<TE>   An ever-pleasant smile and little-boy look belies the fact that
Gordon can be as tough as Earnhardt, as cunning as Petty and as
daring as Junior Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Few passes in NASCAR history have been more dramatic than Gordon's
dash across the pit apron and across the grass to sweep past a
stunned Rusty Wallace to steal the 1999 Daytona 500.</TE>
<TE>   You want tough?</TE>
<TE>   Gordon has had finger-pointing run-ins with a number of drivers,
including Wallace, Ricky Rudd, Tony Stewart, Robby Gordon and others.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to do what you've got to do," explained Gordon. "If a
guy wants to race me clean, I'll try and do the same, but if I get
cut off or hit from behind, that guy had better watch out. He can
expect to get it back. Sometimes, though, it happens that you can't
control your car and you just give him a little bump to move him out
of the way."</TE>
<TE>   That statement could have just as easily come from Earnhardt, the
Intimidator himself.</TE>
<TE>   "No one's meaner out there than Jeff when he's got the finish line
in sight," said Wallace. "He'll jump on the roof and smile and wave
after he wins, but you'd better watch out when he's coming at you."</TE>
<TE>   For his first six years in NASCAR, Gordon heard that his success
was spoon-fed by crew chief Ray Evernham and when Evernham left the
team and Gordon slipped to ninth in points, Gordon detractors
gloated.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon and team owner Rick Hendrick chose Loomis from Petty's team
and after a season jelling in 2000 they came together last year for
six victories, six poles and a championship.</TE>
<TE>   "Every one is special, but I'll admit I got more satisfaction from
winning last year than the earlier ones," Gordon said.</TE>
<TE>   He is more upbeat about racing here this year because of the new
aerodynamic rules that eliminated the air strips on the roof that
helped create packs of as many as 20 cars racing three-wide so close
together that they couldn't maneuver. Most drivers were holding on,
hoping no one would make a mistake and cause "the Big One," which
indeed, did happen last year when Tony Stewart's car catapulted in
the air and landed on top of Bobby Labonte's car.</TE>
<TE>   "I never want to run a race like last year's," he said. "This
won't be like that. The spectators may have loved it, but as a driver
it was frightening.</TE>
<TE>   "This year there should be a lot of great racing and side-by-side
action, but not all that bunching up. I don't think it will be as
boring as 2000. It'll be more like the 1999, '98, '97 race.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to be the same, though, without Dale. I know we'll
move on and the sport will continue to grow, but in my mind there's
something missing. There were times when I dreaded seeing that black
No. 3 in my mirror and there were times when I didn't. If you were
racing him, you knew you were racing the best there was.</TE>
<TE>   "If you beat him, you knew you accomplished something far greater
than you could ever imagine. If you got beat by him, you knew you got
beat by the best. I'll never forget the memories I have with Dale
here at Daytona and there are some things I'm doing out there today
that I learned from him and that I credit him for bringing me to this
level.</TE>
<TE>   "He started out as the guy that I learned from and then he turned
into the guy that I knew was going to be the toughest competition out
there every time I came to Daytona. It's just not the same without
him."</TE>
<TE>   There is a strong Earnhardt presence in the race, however.</TE>
<TE>   Dale Earnhardt Jr., who finished second to Michael Waltrip last
year and then came back to win the July race, will be starting fifth,
directly behind Gordon. He and Waltrip are teammates with Dale
Earnhardt Inc., which is being run by Teresa Earnhardt, Dale's widow.</TE>
<TE>   Although the number has been changed from 3 to 29, Kevin
Harvick--who will start alongside Johnson on the front row--is
driving Earnhardt's old Chevrolet for Richard Childress, for whom the
elder Dale drove for the last 18 years before his death.</TE>
<TE>   Starting on the pole, just in front of Gordon as they take the
green flag, will be Gordon's hand-picked protege, rookie driver
Jimmie Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how he would race Johnson, Gordon grinned and said, "Like a
rookie.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're going to be able to bring him along really fast,
but he's got a lot to learn. I wasn't on the pole here my first year,
but I did have a good finish. I ran second behind Earnhardt in the
closing laps and I didn't have a clue as to what I was doing or what
I was going to do when I came down to the white flag. That's pretty
much why I finished fifth. I learned a lot right then. And I'm still
learning."</TE>

<HD>McCarron Is the Leader of the Pack</HD>
<DH>Golf: He takes one-shot lead after third round at Nissan
Open, where six players are within four of the lead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The riddle goes something like this:</LD>
<LD>   Two men stay in separate hotel rooms, each with a black box, a
padlock and a key. One has a diamond he wants to send to the other by
way of a thieving bellboy who will steal anything but the diamond.
How does he do it?</LD>
<LD>   Charles Howell III has no idea.</LD>
<TE>   But thinking about it helped him shoot a record-tying 28 through
the first nine holes at the Nissan Open, and that was enough to put
the 22-year-old within striking distance in today's final round at
Riviera Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   "I know this is going to sound crazy," he said. "It got my mind
off of golf."</TE>
<TE>   Now the Georgia native must figure his way out of another type of
conundrum: a tightly bunched pack that includes six players within
four strokes of one another.</TE>
<TE>   Scott McCarron stands atop the leaderboard at 14 under, shooting a
six-under 65 thanks largely to a 56-foot putt for eagle on No. 17.
Toru Taniguchi, the so-called "Japanese Tiger," is one stroke back.
Len Mattiace is two back. Rory Sabbatini and Brad Faxon are three
back, followed by Howell at four.</TE>
<TE>   Think of it as golf's version of short-track speedskating, a pack
of competitors racing shoulder-to-shoulder, coming around the final
turn.</TE>
<TE>   "You've just got to go out there and play well," McCarron said,
reducing the problem to its lowest common denominator. "I plan on
making a lot of birdies."</TE>
<TE>   That was certainly the answer Saturday, a morning of streaks and
spurts when the players weren't nearly as sluggish as the gray skies
overhead.</TE>
<TE>   As one of the brightest young stars on the tour, Howell started
things off with an eagle on the par-five, 503-yard first hole. His
streak continued with birdies on Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6 and 9, sufficient to
tie the front-nine record set by Andrew Magee in 1991. It was tonic
to a golfer who had struggled earlier in the week.</TE>
<TE>   "It was important for me to get off to a good start," he said.
"You hit a couple of good shots and get confidence."</TE>
<TE>   But then forces conspired to slow him down. Two groups were
logjammed ahead at No. 10 and the 20-minute wait gave him time to get
his mind off the riddle and back on his game. Next came missed birdie
opportunities at Nos. 11 and 17 with a bogey sandwiched between on
the 14th.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to do a good job of not thinking about it," he said.
"But you have to think about it to not think about it."</TE>
<TE>   Before you try too hard to decipher that one, suffice to say that
Howell cooled off for a round of 64 and the torch was passed to
Sabbatini, who eagled No. 11 by hitting a five-wood to within four
feet of the cup.</TE>
<TE>   He was on his way to a 30 for the back nine, a score he believes
could have been even better.</TE>
<TE>   "I missed four or five putts that were makable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron was not nearly as spectacular, not for most of the day.
The affable veteran--a UCLA alumnus returning to play before a
contingent of old school chums--wasn't particularly pleased with his
game over the front nine. But unlike students taking an exam, golfers
are allowed to peek at the person next to them.</TE>
<TE>   On the 10th, McCarron noticed his pal, Faxon, putting with an open
stance. That gave him an idea.</TE>
<TE>   "I feed off him," McCarron said. "I opened my stance and it
started rolling pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   A string of birdies got him close to Taniguchi, still holding onto
his lead from Friday with a sure and steady round. Then came No. 17.</TE>
<TE>   A five-wood put McCarron at the edge of the green with a putt that
was long but not daunting. Not with fast, firm greens getting such
high marks from the field this week. Not with a player who has
McCarron's attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "When I get inside 100 yards, I'm trying to make it," he said.
"Why not?"</TE>
<TE>   However, he added, "they don't go in very often."</TE>
<TE>   This time it did, drawing a roar from the gallery--the tournament
drew a crowd of 41,319 on Saturday--and pushing him into a slight
lead.</TE>
<TE>   The swarm at the top did not seem to bother him much. With so many
friends around, McCarron said he is intent on having a good time no
matter what happens today.</TE>
<TE>   As for Howell, he would be well-advised to have dinner with his
buddy, first-round leader Jesper Parnevik.</TE>
<TE>   It was Parnevik who got him psychologically prepared by telling
him the riddle before Saturday's round. The brain teaser still had
him going after Saturday's round.</TE>
<TE>   "If anyone can figure it out," Howell said, "let me know."</TE>

<HD>Voice-Activated Trojans Just Might Have Final Say</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This great college basketball game was about USC's passion and
Arizona's precision.</LD>
<LD>   It was about Sam Clancy sacrificing every ounce of energy and some
pieces of flesh to grab a basketball when three Wildcats were trying
to keep it from him. It was about Jason Gardner, the stealth shooter,
making perfect cuts and running to the perfect spot to make
three-pointer after three-pointer.</LD>
<LD>   It was about USC's frantically active full-court pressure and
Arizona's calm recovery from the turnovers the pressure caused. It
was about David Bluthenthal's carefree optimism about finding his
shooting rhythm and Luke Walton's quiet pursuit of the best way
around Trojan defenders--pass or shoot, three-pointer or layup.</LD>
<TE>   What an amazing college basketball game was played at the Sports
Arena on Saturday afternoon. On the line was first place in the
Pacific 10 and on the court were two teams desperate for a
late-season victory, the kind of victory that makes a team dangerous
from now until the end of March.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona had arrived in Southern California in first place. The
Wildcats left with two devastating losses, by a point to UCLA on
Thursday and by 94-89 to USC on Saturday. Yet while watching
Arizona's fearless freshmen react with anger and confidence after
both losses, and seeing how Lute Olson has made a young team improve
every game, it is clear that when they return to Los Angeles for the
Pac-10 tournament next month, the Wildcats will be ready.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the Trojans who made their best and biggest noise of
the season. They swept their two home games, beating Arizona State
badly, as they should have, and beating Arizona any way they could,
as they should have.</TE>
<TE>   Through so many last-second losses--to UCLA, to Oregon, to
California--the Trojans have never lost their way, and with this
victory, they've found their voice.</TE>
<TE>   It is a loud voice, a defiant voice, a voice that shouts, "We will
not go away. Stop us once, we'll start again. Stop us twice, we'll
start over. And over. And over."</TE>
<TE>   After the game, the voices speak softly. There is no bragging, no
swagger in the words. No one hops up on tables to shout at the fans
or at the opponent. One must listen hard to hear Clancy say, "At no
point in this game did I think we were going to lose."</TE>
<TE>   This tough senior, who had 21 points in the first half and 28 for
the game, understood the best part of what happened Saturday
afternoon. "This was one of the funnest games I've played all year
because we were down and we came back to win."</TE>
<TE>   One must lean close to hear Coach Henry Bibby say, "It's important
to win every game. You've got to win the games at home. This weekend
we did that."</TE>
<TE>   As emotional as the Trojans are when they play, they never let
their feelings overwhelm them. When they lose leads, they expect to
make up deficits. They understand they are not so good as to control
every game, but good enough to have a chance to win every game.</TE>
<TE>   Up by 12 in the first half, the Trojans were behind, 45-42, at
halftime, but it didn't matter. There was no loss of aggression, no
time to stop forcing play. When the Wildcats did make it too tough
for Clancy to fight his way to the basketball, Bluthenthal took his
place at the front of the line. He got open shots, he made them.
Three-pointers (seven of them), and then layups, enough for 31
points. Bluthenthal kept running to his ace three-point spot on the
baseline and never hesitated with his shooting motion.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what I'm supposed to do," Bluthenthal said. "Play good
and get some points."</TE>
<TE>   Much as they did in the first half, the Trojans went ahead early
in the second half and then got behind, 69-62. Gardner was
unstoppable, making three-pointers from everywhere. He had 14 against
the two Southland teams.</TE>
<TE>   There was some luck for the Trojans or Gardner might have had his
15th--and forced overtime. With three seconds left and USC leading,
92-89, Gardner hit a slick spot on the court just as he was about to
shoot yet another three. The ball went in but traveling was called.
On replay, it appeared Gardner's pivot foot didn't move and the
basket should have counted. But it didn't and USC hearts weren't
broken again.</TE>
<TE>   The thing about USC hearts, though, is that after they break, they
heal. USC has a team to be proud of. Whether the Trojans are playing
poorly or well, they play hard. They will not get discouraged, they
will not lose.</TE>
<TE>   And there is the feeling right now that they will be carried far
by three seniors--Clancy, Bluthenthal and Brandon Granville.
Granville didn't make a basket in the first half and only two in the
second but he had 11 assists, no turnovers and made seven free throws
in the last two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   USC enters the last two weeks of the regular season tied for the
Pac-10 lead. The conference tournament is in the Trojans' hometown,
at Staples Center. It appears their heads are on straight, their
focus is clear.</TE>
<TE>   Across town, their archrivals had suffered a bad loss to a team
missing two of its top five scorers. That UCLA had fallen to Arizona
State made no difference to the Trojans. At least that's what they
said and it was the right attitude.</TE>
<TE>   Why think about anyone else when you're in first place and
somebody else isn't?</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans are in first place.</TE>

<HD>Final Answer? No, It's Lavin's Futile Answer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now most of us in California were probably playing our own version of
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" on Saturday, although I wonder if
people like Shaq or Jack Nicholson buy a lottery ticket.</LD>
<LD>   By now, of course, most of us are losers--which really got me
thinking about UCLA basketball Coach Steve Lavin.</LD>
<LD>   Here's a guy who should seriously consider incorporating "Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire" into his regular line of work while he has
a job. I mean it's generally understood anyone sitting in the stands
can do a better job coaching the Bruins than Lavin, so why not get
the audience's help when Lavin appears clueless?</LD>
<TE>   This is going to keep the fans busy, of course, if they have to
help every time Lavin appears clueless, which is going to cut into
concession sales.</TE>
<TE>   But why not wire Pauley Pavilion, rent key pads to the Bruin
faithful who want to keep Lavin from blowing the game, and then post
their collective advice on the scoreboard? I'd suggest phoning a
friend, but his friend is Kevin Malone.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE WHOLE idea of getting help, of course, is to avoid the early
exit.</TE>
<TE>   Take Saturday's debacle against Arizona State, for example, and
this $100 question that Lavin missed--effectively knocking the Bruins
out of the Pac-10 championship race in one of the worst losses at
home in some time: There are 2.3 seconds left, you're losing by a
point, Arizona State is shooting free throws and you have one timeout
left--what do you?</TE>
<TE>   Even Tom Arnold could have answered that one correctly. But Lavin
immediately signaled for a timeout, and everyone in the crowd
standing behind him groaned loudly in unison as if it was one of
those celebrity versions of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,"
affording the star a second chance.</TE>
<TE>   When I asked Lavin why he didn't tell Regis he wanted to change
his answer after hearing the audience groan, he looked at me as if he
had no idea what I was talking about.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LAVIN EXPLAINED later he called the timeout so he could tell his
team to run the Christian Laettner play Duke had used to beat
Kentucky in 1992. Since Cedric Bozeman had just turned 9 at the time
and he was going to be asked to play the role of Grant Hill, I
imagine much of the timeout was used to give a history lesson. That
would explain the results.</TE>
<TE>   Duke had 2.1 seconds remaining and the ball out of bounds--a key
detail that Lavin would not take into consideration when trying to
explain his position later. He told reporters he called the timeout
to freeze the shooter, which would have meant a missed free throw, a
rebound and then a heave down the court.</TE>
<TE>   That's what happened--Billy Knight getting the rebound in a crowd,
and then traveling while trying to negotiate his way out of traffic,
the clock running out, UCLA losing, and Arizona State winning for the
first time in Pauley Pavilion since 1987--a year before "Live! With
Regis &amp; Kathie Lee" went national.</TE>
<TE>   Had the Pauley audience been allowed to punch in: "Not now,
dummy," Lavin would have saved the timeout, and the Bruins would have
had the chance to set a play while taking the ball out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, I don't know why he just doesn't turn around in these
situations--he has the Wizard of Westwood sitting almost right behind
him. But even when it came to the postgame news conference, Lavin
still couldn't come up with the correct answers, which tells me
Wooden isn't yelling loud enough.</TE>
<TE>   A member of the school's publicity department stepped in and put a
halt to the media gathering so Lavin could make a run for the door. I
wanted to tell him the kids were just popping the yellow and blue
balloons the school had passed out earlier, and there was no reason
to take cover.</TE>
<TE>   I found him later in his office, which I guess is better than
having Peter Dalis knocking on his door. I told him I thought he
should have saved his timeout and used it on a missed free throw. Or,
if Arizona State had made both free throws, he still could have used
it, had 2.3 seconds left with the ball out of bounds and the chance
to duplicate Laettner's miracle shot.</TE>
<TE>   I chastised him for taking senior Matt Barnes out with 3:35 to
play and a three-point lead, and replacing him with sophomore T.J.
Cummings, who then turned the ball over and allowed Arizona State the
chance to tie the score.</TE>
<TE>   I also criticized him for his team's poor offensive play against
Arizona State's zone defense, and his players' unwillingness to set

<TE>   In each case, he said I was wrong, and imagine how that made me
feel: Lavin telling me I don't know as much about basketball as he

<TE>   NOW THAT the Olympics have shown us that the game isn't over until
the whining has stopped, if I'm Arizona Coach Lute Olson, I'm rolling
the videotape to show that Jason Gardner's foot didn't move when he
made a three-point shot to tie USC. An official ruled Gardner had
traveled, the only difference between the French skating judge and
the Pac-10 officials being that the French judge was pressured to
make a bad decision and the Pac-10 officials just make bad decisions.</TE>

<DH>UCLA: Lavin uses final timeout to ice free-throw shooter
instead of saving it for last play, resulting in turnover and a 69-68
loss to Arizona State.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Send a disobedient child to a corner, it's called a timeout.</LD>
<LD>   Send an opposing free-throw shooter to the bench to make him think
about the shot, that's a timeout, too.</LD>
<LD>   In UCLA's case, perhaps a foolish one.</LD>
<TE>   With the Bruins trailing by one with 2.3 seconds to play Saturday,
Bruin Coach Steve Lavin burned his last timeout before Kyle Dodd of
Arizona State shot a one-and-one free-throw opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "To freeze him like a field-goal kicker," Lavin said.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, Dodd missed the shot. Bruin Billy Knight grabbed the
rebound, turned and saw 90 feet between him and the basket. He longed
to call the timeout UCLA did not have, the timeout that was more
important than whether or not Dodd made even two free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Knight dribbled into traffic, panicked and traveled, Arizona State
won, 69-68, and the crowd of 9,823 left Pauley Pavilion in disbelief.
It was UCLA's fourth consecutive game decided by one or two
points--two victories and two defeats--and erased the pleasant memory
of the thrilling victory over Arizona only two days earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins' win-one, lose-one pattern has lasted six weeks, which
does not bode well for success in the Pacific 10 Conference or NCAA
tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   And it won't keep UCLA (17-8, 9-5 in the Pac-10) in the conference
title race much longer.</TE>
<TE>   "That's definitely not going to get it done," forward Matt Barnes
said.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes was central to another difficult coaching decision. After
Curtis Millage made a three-point basket for a 69-66 Sun Devil lead,
Barnes was fouled rebounding Cedric Bozeman's missed free throw with
7.1 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   He made the first and looked to the bench. The Bruins had only
three fouls, meaning they could not quickly send Arizona State
(14-10, 7-8) to the free-throw line on the ensuing possession.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes wanted to know whether he should miss the second free throw
purposely to give the Bruins a chance for a rebound and a tying or
winning shot. Lavin said no, and Barnes made it to pull UCLA within
one point.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bruins had to foul Arizona State four times to create a
free throw, finally getting Dodd to the line with 2.3 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked after the first one," Barnes said. "I definitely thought
I should miss it and tip it out, but you have to listen to your
coach."</TE>
<TE>   This was Arizona State's first victory at Pauley Pavilion in 15
years and only the second victory over the Bruins in the last 27
meetings. And it was accomplished with two key players sidelined
because of injury--forward Awvee Storey and Kenny Crandall.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have to come down here next year and hear about not
winning since 1987," Sun Devil Coach Rob Evans said. "We can talk
about basketball and not streaks."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA can't say much about streaks, either. After winning nine in a
row in December and early January, the Bruins have run in place,
going 6-6. Much is made of how UCLA typically builds momentum as the
NCAA tournament approaches, but it isn't happening this season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's back to square one," forward Jason Kapono said. "Every time
there is a positive step and we think we are growing as a team,
there's a game like this."</TE>
<TE>   Kapono, UCLA's leading scorer, took only seven shots, making
three--all from three-point range. Arizona State surprised UCLA by
coming out in a zone defense that focused on Kapono, and he had few
open looks, scoring 13 points.</TE>
<TE>   "We were kind of lost out there," he said. "We haven't worked that
much on our zone offense and we were too passive."</TE>
<TE>   Center Dan Gadzuric, coming off his best game of the season, again
led the Bruins with 17 points. Bozeman, coming off perhaps his worst
game of the season, bounced back with 13 points and four assists,
making five of six shots, including his only three-point attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State countered with senior center Chad Prewitt, one of
the conference's hottest players. He scored 22 points and made all
five three-point shots, important because his teammates made only
three of 14 from long range.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA scored the first seven points, but Arizona State rallied to
lead, 28-14. The Bruins pulled within 36-31 at halftime on Ryan
Walcott's three-pointer at the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   The second half was close--neither team led by more than three in
the last 10 minutes despite UCLA not making a field goal in the final
5:15.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome was decided by oddities. Too many fouls to give. Too
few timeouts to take. And whether Barnes should have purposely missed
his last free throw.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin readily acknowledged making poor decisions in the closing
minutes of a one-point loss a week ago at Villanova. This time he
seemed unsure.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost the game so a lot of things cost us," Lavin said. "In
hindsight ..."</TE>
<TE>   His voice trailed off, the postgame news conference was over, and
he quickly made a decision no one could second-guess, ducking out a
side door and out of Pauley Pavilion rather than returning to the
floor and facing more scrutiny.</TE>

<DH>USC: Trojans survive Arizona's late three-point barrage and
hold on for 94-89 victory that moves them into a tie for first place
in Pacific 10.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sickening sense of deja vu began to envelop the Sports Arena late
Saturday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   With USC clutching a narrow lead, its desperate opponent began
banking in three-point shots and chucking in off-balance
three-pointers to close the gap.</LD>
<LD>   "I was just thinking, 'Here we go again,'" Trojan forward David
Bluthenthal said, referring to USC's three losses this season on
buzzer-beating three-pointers. "I was just praying that they'd start
missing some threes."</LD>
<TE>   And the knot in the Trojans' stomachs began to grow larger when
Arizona point guard Jason Gardner, who had already knocked down seven
three-point baskets, sprinted the ball up court with less than seven
seconds to play and USC up by three.</TE>
<TE>   But in what has already been a surreal and heart-wrenching season
for the Trojans, Gardner, in trying to shake Brandon Granville,
slipped at the top of the key and was called for traveling. Gardner's
three-point attempt was good, but the whistle had already blown the
play dead, awarding possession to USC.</TE>
<TE>   On the ensuing inbound play, Sam Clancy found a streaking Errick
Craven and the freshman guard threw down an uncontested and emphatic
dunk for the final points in No. 25 USC's 94-89 victory against the
ninth-ranked Wildcats.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Lady Luck and her cousin Karma were wearing cardinal and
gold and they sat two deep atop a high-stepping Traveler and pranced
around before a spent crowd of 12,573.</TE>
<TE>   With the victory and weekend sweep of the Arizona schools, USC
improved to 18-6 overall and 10-4 in the Pacific 10 and into a
first-place tie with Stanford and Oregon in the jumbled conference
standings. Arizona fell to 17-8, 10-5.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to win every game," said Trojan Coach Henry Bibby,
who won his 100th game at USC, dismissing the notion that finally
winning a game that was in doubt until the final buzzer was more
important than merely getting a victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to win your games at home. This weekend, we did
that."</TE>
<TE>   It wouldn't have been possible without huge games by USC's three
seniors--Bluthenthal, Clancy and Granville, who had beaten Arizona
only once in their careers and had dropped the previous two games
against the Wildcats by a combined 61 points.</TE>
<TE>   Bluthenthal, emerging from his season-long slump, had a
career-high 31 points with career bests in three-pointers (7) field
goals (12) and field-goal attempts (19).</TE>
<TE>   Clancy (28 points, 11 rebounds), had his 10th consecutive
double-double, the most at USC since Ron Riley had 13 in a row over
the 1970 and 1971 season. Clancy also had three assists and two
blocks.</TE>
<TE>   Granville, who had been held scoreless in Arizona's 97-80 victory
at Tucson last month, finished with 12 points--all in the second
half--11 assists and no turnovers in 39 minutes. Granville made seven
of eight free throws in the final 49.8 seconds to help secure the
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "With the combination of Clancy and Bluthenthal, they have perhaps
the best pair of big men in the conference," Arizona Coach Lute Olson
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Bluthenthal spreads you out and Clancy's inside presence is huge.
I thought Granville.... didn't shoot well but he.... really led them
well."</TE>
<TE>   In a game that mirrored the Trojans' season thus far, USC was
brilliant before sputtering. And then after going stagnant on
offense, they exploded to the finish.</TE>
<TE>   Bolstered by a mix of matchup zone defenses, USC flustered Arizona
into a rash of turnovers while building a 12-point lead in the first
half. The Wildcats, though, raced back to take a three-point lead,
45-42, into halftime on a three-pointer by Gardner, who finished with
an Arizona-high 27 points.</TE>
<TE>   And after running out to a 62-56 lead five minutes into the second
half, USC went scoreless for more than five minutes. Arizona took
off, going on a 13-0 run in three minutes to grab a seven-point lead,
69-62, with 11:33 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Bluthenthal, who scored 10 of the Trojans' 12 points during
a 3:25 spurt. USC led by six, 85-79, with 1:17 to play after two of
Robert Hutchinson free throws.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Arizona began dredging up USC's worst fears, Rick
Anderson banking in an ugly-looking three-pointer from 22 feet away
with 40.7 seconds to play and Salim Stoudamire throwing in a wild
off-balance three-pointer from the right corner with 7.7 seconds
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   But Granville was busy at the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just thinking, 'Make the free throws and we win. We've come
this far, don't mess it up now,'" Granville said. "You just block it
out of your mind and let your body take over."</TE>
<TE>   And hope that Lady Luck and Karma are finally sitting on your
bench.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Ortiz Aging Gracefully, but Worries About His Father</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Ramon Ortiz sure looked good for a guy who aged three years in one
winter, as his teammates were all too eager to remind him. On the
first day of spring training Saturday, Ortiz absorbed plenty of
good-natured kidding about playing three years in the major leagues
before the Angels discovered his true age.</LD>
<LD>   Ortiz took it in stride, but his smile masked a heavy heart. His
father is seriously ill, he said, fighting lung cancer back home in
the Dominican Republic.</LD>
<LD>   Ortiz pitched a career-high 209 innings last season and, as a
result, opted not to play in the Dominican winter league. But his
father wanted to see him pitch one more time, unsure if he would be
strong enough to travel to the United States this summer and whether
he would be alive next winter.</LD>
<TE>   So Ortiz pitched one game in the Dominican league, to honor his
father's wish. "If he dies now, he'll die in peace," Ortiz said
through coach and interpreter Alfredo Griffin.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz, who will turn 29 instead of 26 next month, said he did not
intend to deceive anyone about his age.</TE>
<TE>   In the Dominican, as in rural areas of the United States, local
intermediaries can tip off scouts from major league organizations
about unseen talent. In 1995, when one of those intermediaries told
Ortiz he could generate interest among major league scouts, Ortiz
provided his birth certificate as required.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Gomez, the scout who signed Ortiz, was given a certificate
listing Ortiz's birth date as March 23, 1976.</TE>
<TE>   The intermediary, whom Ortiz did not name, told the pitcher he
would alter the birth certificate so Ortiz would be listed as 19, not
22, and thus become more attractive to major league teams.</TE>
<TE>   "I said I didn't want to do it, but he said it was the only way I
could play baseball," Ortiz said. "He said don't worry, you'll be
OK."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz was OK until this winter, when U.S. officials processing his
visa request noticed the birth date on his passport did not match the
one on his birth certificate. With the federal government tightening
border controls in the aftermath of Sept. 11, Ortiz was one of
several Dominicans caught shaving years off his age. Atlanta
shortstop Rafael Furcal is 23, not 21; the same is true for Chicago
Cub pitcher Juan Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Sept. 11, major league officials signaled their
intention to crack down on the oft-suspected practice of falsifying
documents. They opened an office in the Dominican Republic that
scrutinizes birth certificates and other official documents before
teams are allowed to sign Dominican players.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, the Angels don't care how old Ortiz is as long as
he wins. Said Griffin: "I told him, win 20 games and nobody will
care."</TE>
<TE>   Even General Manager Bill Stoneman, in discussing the Angels'
expanded Dominican operations, made light of the revelation of
Ortiz's age.</TE>
<TE>   "We've signed a number of young guys there," Stoneman said. "At
least we think they're young."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With one entirely understandable exception, all 28 pitchers and
nine catchers reported on schedule. The exception: reliever Ben
Weber, who remains at his Texas home after wife Marisa gave birth to
triplets Tuesday. Manager Mike Scioscia said Weber is expected to
arrive in camp Monday.</TE>

<LD>Eighteen months after construction was halted on a downtown ballpark
for the Padres, work will resume Monday, a group of San Diego and
team officials announced Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "The legal war is over and we've won," said City Atty. Casey Gwinn
in a reference to 16 lawsuits filed to block construction of the
planned 42,500-seat ballpark.</LD>
<LD>   The park, modeled after Baltimore's Camden Yards, is set to be
finished by opening day 2004. When voters in 1998 approved the
project, it was set to open in the middle of the 2002 season.</LD>
<TE>   A judge on Jan. 20 tossed out the final lawsuit attempting to
force another public vote. While two of the lawsuits are still on
appeal, that was not seen as a block to selling $169 million in
bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch, the bond underwriter, reported to San Diego Mayor
Dick Murphy on Friday that the bonds had been sold at an interest
rate of 8.53%.</TE>
<TE>   Construction was halted in October 2000 after the city decided not
to provide any additional funds until the lawsuits were thwarted and
the bonds sold.</TE>

<TE>   At least 60 Florida Marlin employees were fired as Jeffrey Loria
closed on his purchase of the team from John Henry.</TE>
<TE>   The entire player development staff was fired, including scouts,
administrators and minor league managers and coaches. The dismissals
had been expected. Loria intended to bring along dozens of employees
with him from the Montreal Expos.</TE>
<TE>   Loria is keeping most of the Marlins' business employees. Also
staying are Andre Dawson and Tony Perez, special assistants to the
general manager.</TE>

<TE>   Philadelphia Phillie third baseman Scott Rolen arrived at spring
training at Clearwater, Fla., with his explanation for rejecting a
$140-million, 10-year contract extension and criticism of team
president.</TE>
<TE>   "Philadelphia is the sixth-largest market in the game, and I feel
that for the last however long, the organization has not acted like
it," Rolen said. "There's a lack of commitment to what I think is
right. I'm not seeing that their No. 1 goal is to put a winning team
on the field."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Tapani retired after 13 years in the major leagues. Tapani,
who was 9-14 with a 4.49 earned-run average last season with the
Chicago Cubs, said he rejected an offer from Arizona.... The Kansas
City Royals defeated shortstop Neifi Perez in salary arbitration.
Perez was given a raise from $3.55 million to $4.1 million. Perez had
asked for $5 million.... In Tampa, Fla., Yankee starter David Wells
reported no problems after throwing off a mound for the first time

<LD>In this pro golf game, Charles Gordon Howell III, the baby-faced son
of a pediatrician from Augusta, Ga., may be the greatest thing since
sliced grits. Of course, you can't slice grits, so you'll just have
to use your imagination.</LD>
<LD>   Howell is cutting quite a dashing figure out there at Riviera
Country Club, where he tied the course record Saturday with a 28 on
the front nine, on his way to a third-round 64 at the Nissan Open.
But it's not just the booming drives, the precise iron shots or the
seeing-eye putts that increase Howell's entertainment value.</LD>
<LD>   For one thing, Howell is pleasant, talkative, relaxed and
friendly. And he's a professional athlete? He's only 22, so maybe he
doesn't know any better. But wait, there's more. Here's a kid from
the Deep South who is taking clothing advice from the veteran
eccentric Jesper Parnevik. Let's just say that Sweden rotates on a
slightly different axis for Parnevik. Howell signed a clothing
endorsement deal with Parnevik's designer friend and very bleached
blond Johan Lindeberg.</LD>
<TE>   Now, as we have come to know him, Parnevik sometimes wears colors
so unique, they don't even have names yet. And we also know that
Howell is a newcomer to the business of power dressing. Coaxed into a
tuxedo by his mother for the senior prom, Howell complained he looked
like a penguin.</TE>
<TE>   He did a photo shoot for Lindeberg a couple of months ago in Palm
Beach, Fla., and Howell was there in front of the cameras for eight
hours. Maybe he was nervous, which is understandable when you realize
that the photographer's last gig had been for Victoria's Secret.</TE>
<TE>   Lindeberg is noted for his "Euro chic" fashion design. Until he
hooked up with Lindeberg, Howell might have thought that Euro chic
was some type of continental fried chicken. All that's in the past
now, because Howell is way up to date in the clothes category.
Totally dressed for success.</TE>
<TE>   Golf photographers have a special fondness for Howell, who not
only wears snappy clothes, but is also fairly expressive out on the
course. One special Howell quirk is that he sticks out his tongue
after he finishes his follow-through and watches the ball on its way
toward the hole. Sticking out the tongue is a Michael Jordan thing,
and you have to say it's worked pretty well for him.</TE>
<TE>   If a guy could make a living by sticking out his tongue or by
making armpit noises or even by walking backward down the fairway,
all the while dropping putts from all over the place and winning golf
tournaments, then you have to nod your head and say, yes, it's a
darned good act.</TE>
<TE>   Getting good is something Howell has been tracking for quite
awhile. He started playing golf when he was 7, and by the time he was
11 he had won five tournaments. David Leadbetter got a star pupil
when Howell began working with the famous teacher. Howell went on to
star at Oklahoma State, where he was NCAA champion in 2000. He was a
two-time first-team All-American and turned pro in June.</TE>
<TE>   Howell played 13 events in 2000, but his only opportunity to keep
playing the PGA Tour was on seven sponsors' exemptions in 2001. In
his sixth tournament, Howell made enough to get temporary status and
wound up playing 24 events, banking $1.784 million and solidifying
his reputation as a force to be reckoned with.</TE>
<TE>   He became the fourth pro to earn his PGA Tour card through
sponsor's exemptions (Tiger Woods, Justin Leonard and Gary Hallberg
were the others). He improved his official world ranking from 324 to
45 (he's 38th now) and became the first player with no official world
tour status to qualify for the Masters in the modern era.</TE>
<TE>   Howell hasn't won a tournament yet, but he's in position to make a
go of it today. His 10-under-par 203 puts him in sixth place, four
shots behind third-round leader Scott McCarron. There is quite a pile
of players with a shot at the $666,000 winner's share; 14 are within
seven shots of McCarron's lead.</TE>
<TE>   Howell is used to groupings, usually concerning the peers in his
age group. It includes Sergio Garcia, David Gossett, Matt Kuchar, Ty
Tryon, Luke Donald, Paul Casey, Aaron Baddeley, Adam Scott and Justin
Rose.</TE>
<TE>   When Howell was asked what would serve to distinguish the players,
the first thing he mentioned was clothes. He was joking. The real
answer, he said, is victories, but the fact that he even mentions the
clothes issue is a noteworthy facet of Howell's potential growth into
a superstar. In the J. Lindeberg catalog, Parnevik wears the
flamboyant stuff and Howell wears the more subdued styles. On
Saturday, it was a tan shirt and a brown argyle sweater. What's he
going to look like if he has to wear a tuxedo to some formal club
affair after he wins some tournament?</TE>
<TE>   That's easy. He'll look like a champion.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mississippi slowed the tempo and free-wheeling Florida simply
couldn't handle it.</LD>
<LD>   The Rebels gave their NCAA tournament hopes a big boost by
dominating the No. 6-ranked Gators in a 68-51 victory Saturday at
Oxford, Miss.</LD>
<LD>   Mississippi, 19-7 overall and 8-5 in the Southeastern Conference,
held Florida--averaging 84.4 points a game--to its lowest point total
in six seasons under Coach Billy Donovan.</LD>
<TE>   "We know we're not going to get into a race with them,"
Mississippi guard David Sanders said. "We wanted to try to slow them
down and make them work for everything they got. We tried to make
them play our style of ball."</TE>
<TE>   Florida (19-5, 8-4) shot 29% as two of its leading scorers, Udonis
Haslem and Brett Nelson, struggled against Mississippi's tight
man-to-man defense. Haslem had 14 points, but made only three of 10
shots and was in foul trouble most of the game. Nelson, who Donovan
said was battling flu, was scoreless in missing nine shots.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been dominated ... like this since my first year when
we started three walk-ons," Donovan said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Mississippi's points came from behind the three-point arc
or the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi, meanwhile, made 10 of 24 three-point shots and was 22
for 27 from the line.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Harper led the Rebels with 18 points and four three-point
baskets. Sanders had 15 points and 11 rebounds, and his defense was
largely responsible for Nelson's first scoreless game in more than
two years.</TE>
<TE>   The Rebels had lost three of their previous four games and decided
to try something different--wear red uniforms instead of traditional
white at home.</TE>
<TE>   Sanders called them "big game uniforms." The last time Mississippi
wore them was against Memphis earlier this season--and also won.</TE>
<TE>   The Rebels had a different look, but a familiar strategy. They
were able to slow the game down on the run-and-gun Gators--milking
the shot clock on nearly every possession and playing tight
man-to-man defense.</TE>
<TE>   Florida had 10 turnovers and scored only 22 points in the first
half, prompting a halftime outburst by Donovan that could be heard in
the hallway leading to the visitors' locker room.</TE>
<TE>   But Donovan's tirade failed to ignite Florida, which lost for the
first time in five games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Kansas 87, Baylor 72--Nick Collison had 22 points as the
Jayhawks (23-2, 12-0 in the Big 12) overcame lethargy and sloppy
ball-handling against the Bears (14-11, 4-8) at Lawrence, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor came in as a 22-point underdog but trailed by only two
points six minutes into the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Collison, however, scored eight points in a 10-2 run that put
Kansas ahead, 83-68.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Oklahoma 73, Kansas State 62--The Sooners (20-4, 9-3 in the
Big 12) used a 19-3 second-half run to break the game open at Norman,
Okla. Kansas State (10-13, 4-8) is 0-8 on the road this season.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma's Aaron McGhee scored 22 points--his fourth consecutive
game with 21 or more--and Jason Detrick, a junior guard, had a
career-high 21.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 Alabama 95, Tennessee 82--The Crimson Tide (22-4, 10-2 in
the SEC) overcame a career-high 30 points by Volunteer junior forward
Marcus Haislip and a miserable second-half start at Tuscaloosa, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama missed its first 13 shots after halftime, helping
Tennessee (13-12, 6-6) take a 51-48 lead, but then went on a 22-6
run.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 21 Georgia 78, No. 10 Kentucky 69--Ezra Williams scored 20
points at Athens, Ga., as the Bulldogs (19-7, 8-5 in the SEC) swept
the Wildcats (17-7, 9-5) for the first time in 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky entered the game with a 99-18 record and eight-game win
streak against Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 Marquette 75, Louisville 63--Cordell Henry scored 23 points
as the Golden Eagles (22-3, 11-1 in Conference USA) affirmed their
highest ranking since March 13, 1979 with the victory over the
Cardinals (14-10, 5-7) at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Reece Gaines, Louisville's leading scorer, had five points--15
below his season average.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 14 Pittsburgh 85, West Virginia 75--Brandin Knight scored a
career-high 29 points as the Panthers (22-4, 10-3 in the Big East)
overcame an inspired first half by the Mountaineers (8-16, 1-11) at
Morgantown, W.Va.</TE>
<TE>   Long-time West Virginia Coach Gale Catlett unexpectedly retired
Thursday, and his nephew Dale was named interim coach.</TE>
<TE>   The Mountaineers scored 45 points and shot 59% in the first half
to take an eight-point halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 16 Oklahoma State 71, Texas A&amp;M 66--Victor Williams' driving
layup with 22 seconds at College Station, Texas, as the Cowboys
(20-6, 7-5 in the Big 12) won for the first time in five road games
and Coach Eddie Sutton notched his 699th career victory.</TE>
<TE>   Texas A&amp;M is 9-17 and 3-9.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 18 Illinois 75, Seton Hall 65--Brian Cook had season highs of
23 points and 15 rebounds at East Rutherford, N.J., as the Illini
(19-7) registered their third consecutive road victory.</TE>
<TE>   Seton Hall is 12-13.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No 23 Ohio State 72, Iowa 66--Boban Savovic scored 15 points,
including two late baskets, as Ohio State (18-5, 9-3) rallied at Iowa
City, Iowa, to win for the first time in three games and take a
half-game lead over idle Indiana in the Big Ten.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa (15-12, 4-9) played without Reggie Evans, the conference's
leading rebounder and the No. 2 scorer. Coach Steve Alford said he
benched Evans for not going to class.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 24 North Carolina State 83, Clemson 54--Anthony Grundy scored
23 points and Marcus Melvin had nine over a span of 1:22 in the
second half at Raleigh, N.C., as Wolfpack (19-7, 8-5 in the Atlantic
Coast Conference) rebounded from a 37-point loss to No. 1 Duke
Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   Clemson (12-14, 3-10) shot 38%.</TE>

<HD>Clippers Score Shootout Victory</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Piatkowski scores career-high 36 points as
L.A. has offense in high gear to beat Dallas, 119-110.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Revisiting the golden age of offense, the Clippers welcomed the
high-scoring Dallas Mavericks back to Staples Center and, after the
gun smoke cleared, outscored them.</LD>
<LD>   In another of the all-out shootouts these teams have been staging
recently, the Mavericks, who lead the NBA in scoring at 105 points a
game, got 110 and still were defeated by nine as Eric Piatkowski
scored a career-high 36, Jeff McInnis had 20 and a career-high 15
assists and the Clippers won, 119-110.</LD>
<LD>   "You know what, they don't mind playing us," said Dallas Coach Don
Nelson of the Clippers. "They're athletic, they get after it. Good
for them.</LD>
<TE>   "We've got them one more time in our place. We'll see what
happens. If they beat us again, they're pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers now lead the season series, 2-1, having scored 112,
117 and 119 points in the three games.</TE>
<TE>   Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry is still talking about the Mavericks'
first visit this season, when the Clippers shot 51% from the field,
made a team-record 14 three-point baskets in 29 attempts, made 14 of
their 18 shots in the third quarter ... and lost by 21.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night, the Clippers found out just before the game that
Quentin Richardson wouldn't play, joining Lamar Odom on the bench,
meaning Piatkowski and Corey Maggette had long nights ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski had 23 points by halftime, including eight in the last
1:10 of the half and played 48 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Maggette, playing on a sore knee, went 44 minutes, scoring 21
points. So you could say it turned out OK for the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   "This was great," Gentry said. "That team there is about as good
as any team in the West. They've got so many weapons, so many
combinations they can throw at you, it's hard to get them stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we did as good a job as you can do defensively and they
still got 110."</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks arrived with their usual retinue, which is like no
one else's retinue.</TE>
<TE>   In came Nelson, 12 players and nine--count 'em, nine--assistant
coaches. The Mavericks actually have 11 assistants, including former
Laker coach Del Harris and former USC coach Charlie Parker, but two
of them didn't make the traveling team.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, owner Mark Cuban, who employs this circus, was there,
dressed as usual in jeans and a sweater. Cuban has missed only two
games all season, although in his case, that gives him more
opportunity to get in trouble, say, by complaining about the
referees.</TE>
<TE>   Socked for a total of $515,000 in fines last season by
Commissioner David Stern, Cuban was recently assessed with another
$500,000 penalty for ripping referees supervisor Eddie Rush, then
turned around and handed another $500,000 to charity.</TE>
<TE>   Cuban has been a good little owner ever since.</TE>
<TE>   "I just go to the games to have a good time," he said before
Saturday's game. "It's not like I actively seek it [trouble].</TE>
<TE>   "It just happens sometimes and you gotta do what you gotta do.
Business happens and when it happens, you gotta be prepared to
respond.</TE>
<TE>   "But you never know, it's early, right?"</TE>
<TE>   The game started as Maverick games usually do, up-tempo and
high-scoring. Four minutes and 39 seconds into it, the Mavericks
already had 13 points, making five of their first eight shots, and
Gentry called timeout in an attempt to get his players to begin
playing defense.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas led by as much as 15-7 but the Clippers started dropping
shots too, enough to close to within, 32-29, at the end of the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Then, late in the second period, with Steve Nash struggling,
Dallas went cold and the Clippers went on an 11-0 run, vaulting into
the lead for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   And then, after the Mavericks stopped that one, the Clippers had
another flurry, starting when Michael Olowokandi blocked a Shawn
Bradley dunk. The Clippers ran and Eric Piatkowski made a
three-pointer. By halftime, the Clippers led, 68-56</TE>

<LD>Another day, another Clipper injury.</LD>
<LD>   In an upset, it wasn't Lamar Odom this time, but Quentin
Richardson, who sprained his left foot at practice Friday and was
unable to play in Saturday night's game against the Dallas Mavericks.</LD>
<LD>   "What else is new with us?" asked Coach Alvin Gentry before the
game. "Corey [Maggette] and those guys can't get in foul trouble,
they're going to have a whole lot of minutes to play tonight."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Olowokandi, on his turnaround season: "It's definitely a
lot of fun.... With Elton [Brand], it definitely made things a little
bit easier. I've grown to the point where I think I want the ball in
the post all the time, but he is sort of the one they run the ball to
the post to, which is fine. It keeps teams busy out there, rather
than focusing on one person and I think overall it's been good for
the team.</TE>
<TE>   "Good things just started to happen.... Over the last 20 games,
it's been a lot of fun and I think for me, it's been very revealing."</TE>
<TE>   "Coming into the season, I still just wanted to rebound and
score.... But it's a team situation, I can't be getting angry or
getting mad. I think everybody wants to score. Everybody wants the
ball in their hands.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing my college coach [at Pacific] always told me, I play
better when I'm scoring, when I get the ball in my hands. Which was
true. So it was something that I had to get over mentally, being able
to go out there, be productive and not score. Not worry about touches
and shots.</TE>
<TE>   "But then there were a few games this year when Elton was out, or
Memphis [Jan. 28, when he tied his career high with 27 points], when
he had a little bit of a slow start, and I was given the opportunity
to get the ball in the post and I was able to make things happen.</TE>
<TE>   "Fine, if I have to rebound and block shots, I'll do that, but I
also welcome the opportunity to get the ball in my hands and score
from time to time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And Olowokandi, on the Clippers' youth: "I always take experience
over youth, especially with this team.... I mean, We're playing well,
don't get me wrong, a lot better than last year--but I still think,
given the level of talent on this team, we're still relatively
underachieving. And I think that's the inexperience factor. And I
think in time, when we have everything together, we'll have a great
season."</TE>

<HD>Earnhardt Jr. Wins in No. 3 Car</HD>
<DH>Motor racing: He edges Waltrip in Busch Grand National on
track where his father was killed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>On the track where his father was killed a year ago on the last turn
of the last lap of the Daytona 500, Dale Earnhardt Jr. drove a No. 3
Chevrolet to victory Saturday in the Live Well 300 Busch Grand
National race at Daytona International Raceway.</LD>
<LD>   Rain delayed the start for 21/2 hours, but the 150,000 spectators
who sat it out were rewarded with an exciting and poignant race.</LD>
<LD>   Second was Michael Waltrip, reversing the finish of last year's
Daytona 500 in which he and Junior finished one-two in cars owned by
Earnhardt.</LD>
<TE>   "I've been either first or second in the last six races I've run
here," Junior said. "I think it's because I like this race track so
much. If I could, I'd run here every week. It's a great racetrack in
a great city. I just feel fortunate to be able to do well here."</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time car owner Richard Childress had entered a
car with '3' on its sides in a race since Earnhardt's death. It is
the number Earnhardt drove for 18 seasons with Childress.</TE>
<TE>   It was also the second consecutive time that Earnhardt Jr. and
Waltrip had finished nose-to-tail at Daytona, having done the same
thing last July in the Pepsi 400, the first time Winston Cup drivers
came to Daytona after the elder Earnhardt's death.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad I had the chance to drive the No. 3, I have to thank
Richard Childress for that," Junior said. "People have wanted to make
this out as a tribute to my father, but it was something that the
Nabisco people planned last year with Richard and my father. Richard
could have used someone else to drive. I'm glad it was me, but I
didn't want to make a big deal of it."</TE>
<TE>   One of the first people to greet the winner was Teresa Earnhardt,
Dale's widow and Junior's stepmother and owner of the car he will
drive in today's Daytona 500.</TE>
<TE>   "I know my winning in the No. 3 car would have made my daddy
happy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Earnhardt dominated the second half of the race, leading 59 of the
120 laps, including the last 46. Waltrip, who was a lap down at one
time, fought his way back to the leaders with the help of Little E,
but never made a serious run at his Winston Cup teammate.</TE>
<TE>   "Junior just had the fastest car out there today," Waltrip said.
"Man, it's so hard to pass. People say, 'Why didn't you do
something?' Well, I was doing a lot, but it's just real hard to pull
it off.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm proud that Dale Jr. and I on the last four race days in
Daytona have been one, two."</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Spencer, smarting from failing to qualify for today's 500,
led 29 laps and was challenging Earnhardt Jr. for the lead five laps
from the end when a cut tire sent him high in Turn 4 and into the
pits for a new tire. Spencer was given a stop-and-go penalty for not
stopping in his pit box. His response was to back up his Pontiac and
drive it to the garage.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Kenseth finished third and Jason Keller fourth, both in
Fords. Earnhardt won the Busch series in 1998 when Kenseth was
second, and again in 1999 before joining his father's Winston Cup
team in 2000.</TE>

<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Matt Herges is eager to become the Dodgers' closer, but the
right-hander will not be the team's primary ninth-inning stopper when
the regular season begins. Nor will anyone else in the bullpen.</LD>
<LD>   Barring a trade for a proven closer, Manager Jim Tracy said
Saturday he will employ a closer-by-committee system to open the
season, with Herges, newly acquired Paul Quantrill and possibly
Giovanni Carrara auditioning for the role. The job won't be won in
camp.</LD>
<LD>   "It's difficult to determine a closer in spring training, because
you run into guys in spring training games that you won't see until
[minor leaguers are called up] in September," Tracy said. "The games
change dramatically when April 2 rolls around. I can't put myself in
a position to be misled by things you're seeing in spring."</LD>
<TE>   Potential closers are probably the most difficult players to
evaluate in spring training because there is no way to simulate the
pressure that accompanies the ninth inning of a one-run
regular-season game before a hostile crowd of 45,000. Grapefruit
League games don't count, and most front-line players are gone by the
fifth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy hopes one reliever eventually emerges as the team's closer,
but he wants to see how Herges, who is more of a power pitcher, and
Quantrill, whose power sinker induces a lot of ground balls, respond
in the regular season before determining who gets the job. And that's
fine with Herges.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely want to be the closer, but during spring training
it's tough to find the closer-type innings," said Herges, who went
9-8 with a 3.44 earned-run average as the Dodgers' set-up man last
season. "If that's the way they want to go, that's fine. They don't
want to say you're the closer now because that's the safe move. In
this situation, that's fair enough for me. That's all I can ask for,
to be considered."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The most important part of a pitcher's training regimen the first
two weeks of camp is his bullpen workouts, but Tracy and Dodger
coaches are putting just as much emphasis on fundamentals such as
defense and bunting.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about the fact that the world champion [Arizona
Diamondbacks] won six more games than us last year," Tracy said. "The
difference in six games can be the execution of a bunt, a bad pickoff
throw ... you could win a game you end up losing. These guys need to
know that every single thing they do out here is important.</TE>
<TE>   "When you talk about six games, you don't have to reach too deep
into the memory bank to find little things that made a difference,
especially in 58 one-run games.... We have to minimize the things you
do to beat yourself."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   News of San Diego Padre outfielder Mike Darr's death in a car
accident Friday hit the Dodger clubhouse hard.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a kid who worked his butt off to live the dream of being
in the big leagues," said pitcher Andy Ashby, who played with Darr in
San Diego. "He was a great guy, a great teammate. I'm so hurt for his
family, for his wife and kids. When things like this happen, you
don't know what to think. It's so sad. It goes to show you anything
can happen to anybody at any time."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger pitcher Stan Spencer played with Darr in the Padre farm
system.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a great guy, the type of guy you want to have on your
team," Spencer said. "He was a sparkplug, he was funny and he had a
great personality. He would do anything for you. He was a talented
player and it's a loss for baseball. I think he would have been a
great ambassador for the game."</TE>

<HD>No Contest as Saugus Rolls, 61-38</HD>

<LD>Saugus High began its girls' basketball program in 1977, but the
Centurions only recently got good at it. Before last season, they had
never won a playoff game or a league championship.</LD>
<LD>   A 61-38 rout of visiting Lancaster Antelope Valley on Saturday
night in a Southern Section Division II-AA second-round game sent the
two-time defending Foothill League champions to the quarterfinals for
the second consecutive season.</LD>
<LD>   Saugus (24-4) plays Wednesday at Fullerton Troy, which won the
Division I-A title last season. Troy defeated Villa Park in the
second round, 75-30.</LD>
<TE>   Saugus has built around a talented class of juniors that includes
6-foot-3 Sheridan Arredondo, 6-2 Jessi Loring, 6-0 Julia Bradley,
5-11 Lisa Sonnenblick and point guard AnnMarie Summerhays.</TE>
<TE>   Three-time defending Golden League champion Antelope Valley (25-4)
had no one taller than 5-10, allowing Saugus to dominate inside.</TE>
<TE>   Arredondo had 25 points, 14 rebounds and seven blocked shots for
the Centurions, who made 22 of 41 shots, with 17 baskets coming from
within four feet.</TE>
<TE>   Loring added 15 points, Sonnenblick scored nine and Summerhays had
eight assists.</TE>
<TE>   "When this group came in, I knew we were going to be good," Coach
Eric Olsson said. "They have come in and completely turned this
program around."</TE>
<TE>   Shaquina Mosley scored 13 points and Laurie Hodges added 11 for
the Antelopes, who trailed, 39-33, with three minutes left in the
third quarter but missed 19 of their last 20 shots.</TE>

<TE>   Norco 71, Placentia El Dorado 49--Not only did El Dorado Coach
Wayne Carlson scout Norco in person, but he also watched the Cougars
on videotape. But the Norco team that showed up in El Dorado's gym
was a squad that hadn't made an appearance all year.</TE>
<TE>   Playing its best game of the season, and surprising even its own
coach in what the coaches admitted was probably a pick'em game, Norco
knocked out El Dorado in the second round of the Division II-AA
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Norco (21-7) was led by Denise Snyder, a senior who averages eight
points but scored 18.</TE>
<TE>   "We were expecting a real close game," said Snyder, who did her
part to ensure the game got out of hand quickly. She needed less than
six minutes to reach her season average, and she scored 12 in the
first nine minutes as Norco eventually opened a 23-12 margin.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars added an 11-2 run with three consecutive three-point
baskets, two by Kimberly Smith and one by Ashley Wysocki, and led at
halftime, 36-20.</TE>
<TE>   Melissa Jacob scored 23 for El Dorado (23-4), but Norco Coach Rick
Thompson credited Snyder with making Jacob work so hard on offense
and never giving her any easy looks.</TE>
<TE>   It also made it tougher on Jacob to guard Norco freshman Erika
Arriaran, who finished with 20 points, 14 rebounds, six assists and
four steal. Smith scored 16 for Norco.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight, with six seniors and 10 returners, I think maybe we were
complacent during the regular season," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we continue to play defense like this game by game, we have a
good chance of moving forward in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Norco will play Ventura Buena on Wednesday in a quarterfinal.</TE>

<HD>Canani Has Winner in Nazirali</HD>

<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A winner of only one race approaching the halfway point of Santa
Anita's winter-spring meet, trainer Julio Canani picked the right
race to end his cold streak.</LD>
<LD>   Nazirali, an Irish-bred gelding who had never before run in a
graded stakes, outfinished 5-1 second choice Continental Red by a
neck to win the $200,000 San Luis Obispo Handicap on Saturday at
Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Michael House and ridden by Brice Blanc, Nazirali, the
7-1 third choice in the field of seven in the Grade II, won for the
third time in six starts. He is now two of three in this country
since being purchased privately. He completed the 11/2 miles on turf
in 2:26.</LD>
<TE>   Denon, the 3-5 favorite, finished fifth, but he had a legitimate
excuse. Saving ground along the rail throughout under jockey Chris
McCarron, the 2001 Hollywood Derby winner was trapped behind a
stopping Apache Wings, who had set the pace for the first eight
furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little bit afraid in the post parade because he was
getting a little bit wound up," Blanc said. "But, as soon as we broke
out of the gate, he relaxed nicely and we had a little bit of pace in
the race today.</TE>
<TE>   "Julio's done a great job of getting this horse to relax and it
worked out well today. I think we've got a good horse for the
[$400,000] San Juan Capistrano [on April 21] now because this horse
can gallop all day."</TE>
<TE>   For Continental Red, it was his second tough loss in a stakes at
the meet. On Jan. 21, he lost the San Marcos by a nose to Irish
Prize. The California-bred has run eight times on the Santa Anita
turf course without a victory, but he has four seconds and a third
and has earned nearly $107,000 for owner Sharon Fitzpatrick.</TE>
<TE>   Bonapartiste, a 19-1 outsider, was third.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The margin of victory was closer, but the outcome of the $200,000
Fountain Of Youth Stakes at Gulfstream Park was the same as the Holy
Bull about a month earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Booklet, who prevailed by three-quarters of a length over Harlan's
Holiday on Jan. 19, held on to win by a nose over that colt in the
final major prep for next month's Florida Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by John Oxley and trained by John Ward, who won the Florida
and Kentucky Derbys last year with Monarchos, Booklet, the 5-1 third
choice, took the lead immediately under jockey Jorge Chavez and
gamely held on in the final yards. He completed the 11/16 miles in
1:442/5.</TE>
<TE>   Harlan's Holiday, the 2-1 favorite, finished five lengths clear of
Blue Burner, then came Political Attack, Speed Hunter, Stephentown,
the 5-2 second choice, Grey Beard and Maybry's Boy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day at Gulfstream, Cetewayo, an 18-1 outsider,
rolled to a 31/4-length victory over 5-2 favorite Band Is Passing and
10 others in the $200,00 Gulfstream Park Breeders' Cup Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   An 8-year-old His Majesty horse owned by J.A. Chandler and trained
by Michael Dickinson, Cetewayo ran the 13/8 miles on turf in 2:172/5
under jockey Cornelio Velasquez.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Xtra Heat, the 7-10 favorite, won for the 19th time in 24 starts,
capturing the $200,000 Barbara Fritchie Handicap at Laurel.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Harry Vega for owners Kenneth Taylor and Harry Deitchman
and trainer John Salzman, the 4-year-old filly and 128-pound
highweight earned her fifth win in six tries at Laurel, scoring by
nearly three lengths over defending Fritchie champ Prized Stamp. Xtra
Heat completed the seven furlongs in 1:223/5.</TE>
<TE>   "She is a runner,'' Salzman said. "I was worried about the weight.
The only thing they didn't put on her is that awning over there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lady George, the 6-5 favorite, earned her third stakes victory
with a half-length victory over 6-1 longshot Icantgoforthat in the
$107,400 Boo La Boo Stakes at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Gordon Severson and trained by Tony Locke, the 3-year-old
Lake George filly, who was purchased for $2,500 as a yearling, won
for the fourth time in 11 starts. She has earned $303,416.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Jose Silva, Lady George completed the six furlongs in
1:101/5. Super High, the 7-2 second choice, was third, two lengths
behind the pacesetting Icantgoforthat.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leaping Plum, the 11-year-old who was trying to win the Grasmick
Handicap at Fonner Park for an eighth consecutive year, had to settle
for third at the Grand Island, Neb., track.</TE>
<TE>   R C Mr Hay Boy, a 28-1 longshot, won the race, completing the four
furlongs in 454/5. April Sunshine was second.</TE>

<HD>Reports Say Williams Fired Gun</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TRENTON, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Authorities have no immediate plans to arrest anyone in the fatal
shooting of a man at former basketball star Jayson William's estate
but might file charges in the future, a prosecutor said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities were called to Williams' 65-acre estate early Thursday
and found Costas Christofi, 55, a limousine driver hired by Williams,
in a bedroom with a shotgun wound to his chest.</LD>
<LD>   Acting Hunterdon County Prosecutor Steven C. Lember would not say
who prosecutors believe was the shooter. He has said Williams, his
brother Vincent and about 10 guests were in the house at the time.</LD>
<TE>   "The fair thing to say is we have a pretty good idea of who [the
shooter] was and we're trying to determine how that happened," Lember
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Star-Ledger of Newark, the Record of Hackensack and several
broadcast stations said unidentified law enforcement sources told
them Williams accidentally fired the gun.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' agent, Sal DiFazio, said he had spoken with the former
New Jersey Nets' player since the shooting. DiFazio said he was aware
of the Star-Ledger's report and that it was "a very accurate
portrayal of where everything is, as far as I know."</TE>

<HD>Bryant Is Not Trying to Force the Issue</HD>

<LD>To pass or not to pass.</LD>
<LD>   That has become the question for Kobe Bryant as he tries to fill
the big hole left by the absence of injured center Shaquille O'Neal.
Are the Lakers better served if Bryant fires his deadly jump shot
from the outside and zig-zags his way through opposing defenses to
the hoop, or are they better off if he involves his teammates more by
thinking of himself first as a playmaker?</LD>
<LD>   The question would have seemed absurd several years ago when the
teen-aged Bryant joined the Lakers out of high school as a shooting
star. In those days, he wanted the ball in his hands for only one
reason: to put it in the basket.</LD>
<TE>   But at 23 and mature beyond his years, Bryant has become the
consummate team player. Bryant had been averaging 5.5 assists a game
before last week. But in the last three games, with O'Neal out with a
chronic toe injury, Bryant has had 35 assists, nearly 12 a game.</TE>
<TE>   In all three games, the Lakers played sluggishly for more than
half the game. They rallied to win the first two, but Friday night,
with Bryant taking only 13 shots, the team lost to the Atlanta Hawks.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant says it comes down to what opposing defenses give him.</TE>
<TE>   "We just have to stay in our system and run our offense," he said.
"If I am going to get good screens and come off and get good shots,
then I am going to take them."</TE>
<TE>   Teammate Robert Horry doesn't want to see the old Bryant
resurface.</TE>
<TE>   "He needs to do what he needs to do," Horry said, "and not just
try to take over the game.If he does that, then he is going to take
away from us."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers hope the argument is academic after today's game at
Portland, Ore. Eligible to come off the injured list after today,
O'Neal says he will be on the court at Staples Center on Tuesday
night to face the Boston Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean Bryant will abandon his mission to carry the
team. It only means he'll have someone to share the load.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<TE>   Records--Lakers 35-14, Trail Blazers 26-24.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Trail Blazers--1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The last time the Lakers saw the Trail Blazers, it was
opening night and O'Neal was feeling no pain. At least none that was
evident. In a 98-87 Laker victory at Staples Center, O'Neal tied
Bryant for the game high in scoring with 29 points, had a game-high
18 rebounds and even led the Lakers in assists with five.</TE>

<HD>Magic Shooting Touch Too Much for Rockets</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orlando Magic shot the ball so well, there was no way for the
Houston Rockets to stop it.</LD>
<LD>   Tracy McGrady scored 39 points and had 12 rebounds to lead the
Orlando Magic to a 109-100 victory Saturday night at Houston.</LD>
<LD>   "McGrady's in a class with [Kevin] Garnett," Houston Coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. "If he were playing in the old days, they would
have thought he was from another planet. He's quick and he's so long.
With that size, he's a special player."</LD>
<TE>   Darrell Armstrong scored 27 and Pat Garrity added 17 for Orlando,
which never trailed.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando made seven of its first eight shots, including four of
five by McGrady, to take a 16-9 lead. The lead reached 33-16 as the
Magic made five consecutive three-point baskets late in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "That was just an amazing display of shooting," said Orlando Coach
Doc Rivers, whose team shot 61 percent in the first half. "I didn't
think they actually defended us that poorly."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Said Tomjanovich: "It was the best shooting exhibition I've seen
all year."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 99, Boston 79--Gary Payton had 19 points and Brent Barry
added 17 points, nine rebounds and nine assists to help the
SuperSonics end a three-game home losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle opened the third quarter with a 14-5 run, including 11
from Payton, to build a 19-point lead at 71-52 with 3:40 left.</TE>
<TE>   SuperSonic forward Rashard Lewis was ejected on his own bobblehead
doll night after swearing at referee Ron Olesiak for a no-foul call
in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 114, Chicago 101--Lamond Murray scored 37 points and
Tyrone Hill had 16 points and 15 rebounds in his first game of the
season for the Cavaliers at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Andre Miller had 18 points, 15 assists and eight rebounds for the
Cavaliers, who have won a season-high four in a row. Hill missed
Cleveland's first 50 games because of chronic back problems.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago played without forward Ron Artest, who sat out after
dislocating his right pinkie Friday against New Jersey.</TE>

<LD>No Place Like Philly for All-Star Phollies: Ask Kobe Bryant,
remembering it is safer than experiencing it.</LD>
<LD>   The interesting thing about All-Star games isn't the game, but the
snapshot of a league in transition that emerges from this rite of
marketing, partying and narcissism (see: Chris Webber's
shiny-to-the-point-of-blinding sneakers) when Commissioner David
Stern's "NBA family" gathers.</LD>
<LD>   It's more like "the NBA's family of products," featuring a
once-hot, now-lukewarm-but-still-promising men's league and a
struggling women's circuit, which Stern keeps trying to sneak into
the general consciousness.</LD>
<TE>   How about (gag) three-ball?</TE>
<TE>   How about Tamika Catchings of the Indiana Fever on the NBA Web
site, analyzing the Laker-Wizard game?</TE>
<TE>   Not that I have anything against the WNBA. I have a daughter, I
like the fact it exists. It just doesn't follow that it must meet
sales projections or be a bust, or that the NBA audience should be
constantly assailed by its promos.</TE>
<TE>   Stern, then in his heyday, thought the women would remain the
headliners they were at the 1996 Olympics, which was a one-shot. In
real life, the WNBA is an add-on to a crowded calendar and whatever
the market says it is.</TE>
<TE>   But then, the All-Star game is all about juxtaposing the tiresome,
the excessive and sometimes even the sublime.</TE>
<TE>   The "host," 76er owner Ed Snider, kicked this one off with a
classic display of bad manners, complaining about not getting enough
seats for season ticket-holders, sputtering: "If I could give the
game back, I would. I can tell you this for sure: We will never apply
for another [one]."</TE>
<TE>   This was an uber-embarrassment for Philadelphia, which, in answer
to its stereotype, now calls itself "The city that loves you back."
But it was departed 76er President Pat Croce, not Snider, who landed
the event; this was just Ed's idea of a nice going-away present.</TE>
<TE>   Snider is in basketball only by corporate accident. The owner of
the NHL's Flyers, he fought the 76ers tooth and nail for years and
knows little about the NBA team he was put in charge of by majority
owner Comcast.</TE>
<TE>   The Flyers are Snider's life and the NHL is a world he
understands, where the money is smaller and the players mostly rural
Canadians, as opposed to the NBA, where one must bet huge sums on
splashy, large-living youths.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is he much interested. When Coach Larry Brown's vows to leave
hit the press, Snider's response from his Santa Barbara winter home
was, "I'm out here in California having a good time and all these
reports are trying to spoil that."</TE>
<TE>   If the 76ers unravel, Snider's fellow Philadelphians may spoil
more than his vacations. Unlike Bryant, he actually lives there when
the weather warms up.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was local icon Allen Iverson, in vintage
endearing/partying form.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday at Charlotte, three days before the All-Star game, he
passed up the 76ers' shoot-around, saying he was ill, then scored 36
points in 45 minutes that night in a win over the Hornets.</TE>
<TE>   Just off the plane home, he was photographed at 2 a.m. Friday in a
Center City club.</TE>
<TE>   Friday afternoon, he blew off the media session, saying he was
ill.</TE>
<TE>   Friday night, he was back on the town at the party he was hosting
at a downtown mall.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday he attended a makeup media session with Michael Jordan,
which became the nicest moment the NBA had had since the '80s, when
Magic Johnson and Larry Bird became friends, turning the old
Laker-Celtic feud into a love-in.</TE>
<TE>   Admitting what he had secretly felt in his snarling-rookie days,
Iverson gushed of Jordan, "I mean, he's the guy all of us wanted to
be like."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan reprised his career, which seemed, in retrospect, just like
Iverson's, starting with Mike's All-Star debut, when veterans jealous
of his Nike deal froze him out. The generations embraced, at last.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Saturday night, Iverson was back on the party circuit
and by Sunday afternoon was in no shape to fight Bryant for MVP
honors, disappointing the crowd, as did Jordan's cameo and the West's
romp, until the fans started in on Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, this didn't dishonor Bryant, just those who tried to
dishonor him, so you can't say that Philadelphia got the hoped-for
image makeover.</TE>
<TE>   There's a gulf between New York and Los Angeles, where the stars
live, and everywhere else, like Philadelphia, a place I lived for 10
years and love, where the presumed attitude of the rare celebrity in
their midst, like the child Kobe, accused of turning his back on them
at 17, is so earthshaking.</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia Daily News, while pursuing all the celebs it
could photograph, zinged locals "for displaying ridiculously low
self-esteem. Why were we so shocked to see Hollywood movie stars,
Grammy Award-winners and big-time jocks here in town--and having a
good time? The last time we checked, Philadelphia was the
fifth-largest city in the nation."</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully, they'll amass more self-esteem in the 30 years before
the NBA returns, assuming Ed Snider Jr., or whoever's in charge, is
over it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   NBA general managers interrupted their All-Star weekend en masse
to drive to Trenton, N.J., to see 6-foot-7 LeBron James, a high
school junior from Akron, Ohio, who is not eligible for this draft.
The consensus: He's the next Kobe. The high end of projections: One
GM noted, "If he improves, he'll be the best ever." ... Next
overrated event, Thursday's trade deadline. Tradition says there'll
be more talk than action. Moreover, unless someone loses it, as the
Phoenix Suns did last summer, it's hard to change a team by trades,
even if half the league is desperate.... Denver's Nick Van Exel, who
says he'd opt out of his last two years--worth $26 million--to
escape, blew off a practice last week, missed a start, was booed,
taunted the crowd to pile it on, then went to the sideline, perhaps
to keep from getting hurt and discouraging bidders.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Knick Coach Don (Dead Duck) Chaney, hoping for a
reprieve from the governor, emerging from a meeting with GM Scott
Layden to announce: "We're very small. We need a post-up presence.
There's some things that are very exciting." ... The Knicks are
offering their usual package of Latrell Sprewell or Allan Houston
plus Marcus Camby, oft-injured and now out for a month. There may be
a GM who'd give them a big man for that, if only Layden could get one
drunk enough.... The Memphis Commercial-Appeal, obtaining records
from the publicly owned Pyramid, showed both the Grizzlies and the
University of Memphis inflating crowd counts by more than 2,000 a
game. The Grizzlies have reported average attendance of 14,548, but
the real number is 12,271. "What we do is follow league guidelines,"
said Grizzly vice president Mike Golub. "That's what NBA teams do
around the league." Translation: "We lie. That's what NBA teams do
around the league."</TE>
<TE>   More support for Bryant from another Philadelphian, Houston's
Cuttino Mobley: "He loves Philly so much, that's bad. People are so
quick to root for somebody that's not even from Philadelphia and then
they do that to him. It really hurt me because of how I love home so
much. And Kobe loves home. Then he comes home and they boo him." ...
New Jersey's Jason Kidd, a likely candidate to leave as a free agent
in 2003, shook up the Nets, saying he'd love to play with his friend
Tim Duncan. Duncan is now thinking in terms of staying, since the San
Antonio Spurs will have more than $20 million of cap room. "I would
hope I could attract a superstar, star, whatever it may be, to San
Antonio to see what we're doing, what kind of team we have, the
history we have of winning," Duncan said. "That in itself could be
enough to bring people around. I love the place. I love being there."</TE>
<TE>   What's the world coming to when an NBA superstar can't date an
international supermodel in peace? Webber went bonkers at a
Sacramento Bee story about Tyra Banks, his constant companion,
spotted in Philadelphia sitting on his lap. Webber vowed in an
obscenity-filled videotaped tirade that he'd stop talking to local
writers.... Had to happen: Sacramento's Gerald Wallace, beaten fairly
in the dunk finals by Golden State's Jason Richardson, vowed never to
return: "It's all politics," said Wallace. "I'm not doing it
anymore." ... I give up, who's Gerald Wallace?</TE>

<HD>Miami Linebacker Is Killed in Auto Accident</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Campbell, a starting linebacker on the Miami Hurricanes'
national championship football team, was killed in a car accident
early Saturday. He was 21.</LD>
<LD>   Campbell apparently lost control of the Toyota Corolla he was
driving and hit a tree at about 4 a.m. EST Saturday, Sgt. Raul
Pedroso of the Coral Gables Police Department said.</LD>
<LD>   A passenger in the car, Joel Rodriguez, was in stable condition at
Jackson Memorial Hospital, Pedroso said. No other car was believed to
be involved in the accident near the school's campus, Pedroso said.</LD>
<TE>   The cause of death was to be determined by the Miami-Dade County
medical examiner after an autopsy and a toxicology exam.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell was a three-year starter and provided veteran stability
for Miami's young linebacker corps. A senior, he was projected as a
possible NFL draft pick.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell had 68 tackles, two sacks and one interception in the 11
games he played last year. He missed this year's Rose Bowl after
suffering a knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell's father, 48-year-old Willie Searcy, learned of the crash
while waiting for his son's weekly call at 8 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "I had gotten up because I was looking forward to his call," said
Searcy, of Mount Pleasant, Texas. "And then, the police came to the
door and told me."</TE>
<TE>   Searcy said he last talked to his son Monday, when they discussed
Campbell's May graduation and his 22nd birthday on Feb. 28.</TE>
<TE>   Miami Coach Larry Coker called Campbell's death "a terrible loss
for the Miami football family."</TE>

<TE>   Alabama has notified the NCAA of its plans to appeal recent
sanctions on the football program, challenging both of the most
high-profile allegations of paying recruits.</TE>
<TE>   The university plans to appeal a number of key issues cited by the
NCAA, including the Committee on Infractions' designation of Alabama
as a repeat violator stemming from a 1999 men's basketball case that
didn't lead to sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   Once the NCAA responds, Alabama officials will have 30 days to
file a written appeal. The process typically takes five to six
months.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 1, the NCAA put Alabama on five years' probation, stripped
the Crimson Tide of 21 scholarships over three years and banned the
team from playing in bowls the next two seasons for what it termed
some of the most extreme violations ever.</TE>

<TE>   Top-seeded Venus Williams advanced to the final of the WTA Diamond
Games by defeating France's Amelie Mauresmo, 7-6 (7), 6-0, in front
of a capacity crowd of 12,000 at Antwerp, Belgium. Williams will face
second-seeded Belgian Justine Henin, who beat Patty Schnyder of
Switzerland, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   The win was Williams' second over Mauresmo in as many tournaments.
The two played a close semifinal at the Gaz de France last weekend in

<LD>The string of bright, sunny days at the Nissan Open ended Saturday
with a gray sky and cool winds for the third round. But after stormy
conditions at Riviera Country Club the previous two years, the
players did not mind a little overcast.</LD>
<LD>   "The ball is still flying fine and the course is still playing
fast," said Rory Sabbatini, who shot a six-under 65 to pull within
three strokes of the lead. "That's the way Riviera was designed to
play."</LD>
<LD>   Several players said the greens--which they recalled as soft and
bumpy from inclement weather last year--were in the best shape they
had ever seen. "It's nice to play when it's not raining down every
day," Len Mattiace said.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scott McCarron has a ritual when he comes to this tournament,
something that dates back to his days at UCLA in the late 1980s. The
Bruin alumnus rounds up 15 to 20 tickets for some of his former
schoolmates, then they spend Friday night having dinner at their old
fraternity.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron hesitated when asked what transpired inside the Beta
Theta Pi house.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all secret stuff," he said. "I really can't tell you."</TE>
<TE>   He did, however, reveal there was no food fight.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charles Howell III and his riddle about the two men, the bellboy
and the diamond might have seemed silly but Mattiace saw the deeper
meaning in it all.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all good enough to hit the right shots," he said. "How come
some guys do and some guys don't?"</TE>
<TE>   The answer, he said, is psychology.</TE>
<TE>   Mattiace is one of many players on the tour who work with a sports
psychologist. He figures that by focusing on the riddle during
Saturday's round, Howell was blocking out distractions.</TE>
<TE>   "To think about the important things at the time.... that's the
trick," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Robert Allenby followed his second-round 66 with a 73 on Saturday
and he's tied for 57th at one-under 212. At least Allenby made the
cut (by three shots), ending a dubious streak--the defending
champions in the last four tournaments had missed the cut: Joe Durant
at the Bob Hope, Mark Calcavecchia at Phoenix, Davis Love III at
Pebble Beach and Phil Mickelson at the Buick.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Buck Moore, who caddies for Howell, is a colorful character who
uses body english to coax putts into the hole and keeps the sale tag
on his cap for good luck.</TE>
<TE>   "I would never take that tag off," Moore said. "I'll tell you,
he's going to be something this week."</TE>
<TE>   Howell already is something this week, in sixth place after a 64
on Saturday that included a record-tying 28 on the front side at
Riviera. Moore, who worked for K.J. Choi last year, is sharing time
with Tony Navarro carrying Howell's bag. Moore says he is going to be
working for Howell at the Masters, but Howell said he wasn't sure.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how Moore said Howell hired him this week: "'What you
doin?' I said, 'Starving.' He said, 'You got a job.'"</TE>
<TE>   Moore said he has known Howell since Howell and his son went to
school together in Augusta, Ga. He has long been impressed with
Howell's ability.</TE>
<TE>   "When he gets his first win, watch out. He doesn't back down, he
doesn't get scared, he's got all the shots. And he listens. That's a
good combination."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   McCarron won a career-best $1.793 million last year, which
included a victory at the BellSouth Classic, rebounding from a
three-year period when he says he wasn't close to reaching his
potential.</TE>
<TE>   What put McCarron back on track was working with teacher Jim
Hardy, a friend of Peter Jacobsen's. McCarron said he is a
"feel-type" player who got lost spending too much time on mechanics.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>C.J. Massingale matched a career high with 25 points to give the
Washington Huskies a 75-60 upset victory over California on Saturday
night at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   With Arizona losing earlier in the day, a victory by the Bears,
18-6 overall and 9-5 in the Pac-10, would have given them a share of
first place with four games remaining before the conference
tournament. Instead, California is tied for fifth with UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   Washington (9-16, 3-12) led 38-33 after Massingale scored the
Huskies' first seven points of the second half, but the Bears
responded with a 12-0 run that gave them a 45-38 advantage with 14:13
left in the game.</LD>
<TE>   The Huskies regained the lead at 53-51 on a three-point basket by
Curtis Allen with 9:06 to play. From that point, Washington never
trailed.</TE>
<TE>   Allen put the game away by scoring the Huskies' last eight points
on free throws in the final minute. Allen finished with 12 points.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Wrenn, Washington's top scorer, did not make a field goal
until 7:15 was left in the game and finished with only six points.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Shipp had 15 points for Cal, which failed to post its first
five-game conference winning streak since it won six in a row in
1997.</TE>
<TE>   Washington is ninth in the conference, a half game behind Oregon
State. The Huskies play the Beavers on Thursday in a game will help
determine which team gets the eighth and last spot in the conference
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 12 Stanford 76, Washington State 63--Curtis Borchardt had 19
points, 11 rebounds and five blocks, and the Cardinal (17-6, 10-4)
began the second half with a 17-5 run that shook off the Cougars
(5-18, 1-14) at Pullman, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford got 24 points from Casey Jacobsen, which helped negate a
29-point effort from Washington State's Marcus Moore.</TE>
<TE>   Moore was four for seven from three-point range with 18 points in
the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford took its first lead at 24-21 on a three-pointer by Julius
Barnes with 8:17 remaining in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinal led by three points at halftime, then used the run to
pull away to a 54-39 advantage early in the second half. Stanford
held Washington State to one for six shooting during the run, and
parlayed that into its 12th consecutive victory in the series.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State closed within 71-61 on Moore's jumper with 2:54
remaining, but Barnes answered with a 3-point shot on Stanford's
ensuing possession to end the Cougars' final threat.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobsen had 13 points in the second half and Borchardt had 10.</TE>
<TE>   The loss was the 15th in 16 games for Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 17 Oregon 91, Oregon State 62--Frederick Jones had 23 points,
Luke Ridnour scored 20 and Luke Jackson had 19 as the Ducks (18-7,
10-4) moved into a three-way tie for first place with Stanford and
USC.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's conference record is its best since 1975-76.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks also improved to 14-0 at McArthur Court--their best home
start since 1937-38, when they went 16-0.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Ricci had 20 points and nine rebounds for Oregon State
(10-14, 3-11).</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks defeated the Beavers for the eight time in a row and
17th time in 18 games. Oregon last lost to Oregon State at home in
1992.</TE>
<TE>   The 29-point victory tied the largest margin of victory by the
Ducks in the series, equaling a 42-13 win on Feb. 11, 1921.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State used a 21-10 run to close within 28-25 with 6:10 left
in the first half. But Oregon closed out the first half with a 17-2
run and led 45-27.The Ducks used a 22-4 run to extend their lead to
69-36 eight minutes into the second half. With 6:35 remaining,
Anthony Lever made a three-pointer to give Oregon an 82-45 lead--its
largest of the game.</TE>

<HD>Dickau Upstages Waves</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Gonzaga senior leads Bulldogs past
Pepperdine, 91-78, into tie for WCC lead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SPOKANE, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Of all the nights to try to beat Gonzaga on its home court,
Pepperdine ended up here on this one.</LD>
<LD>   It was Senior Night for Dan Dickau.</LD>
<LD>   Four thousand fans can get quite loud when they're saying goodbye
to their tousle-headed star--and aiming for payback after
Pepperdine's upset victory last month in Malibu.</LD>
<TE>   Jittery-looking Pepperdine was in trouble from the start, and No.
8 Gonzaga pounced on the Waves' turnovers and missed shots to score
the first 11 points and take a 15-point lead by halftime in a 91-78
victory at the Martin Centre.</TE>
<TE>   It was the 26th home victory in a row for Gonzaga.</TE>
<TE>   "The crowd can't score any points," Pepperdine Coach Paul Westphal
said. "Gonzaga's a good team."</TE>
<TE>   It was a game that could have clinched the West Coast Conference
regular-season title and probably a Top 25 ranking for Pepperdine,
which had been unbeaten in league games.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Gonzaga (24-3) and Pepperdine (18-7) are tied for first
in the WCC at 11-1 with two games left.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got home games and they've got road games, but I don't
think they'll have any problem," said Westphal, whose team closes
with San Diego--which took the Waves to two overtimes earlier--and
Santa Clara.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga plays next at San Francisco and St. Mary's.</TE>
<TE>   The expectation is that Gonzaga and Pepperdine will meet for Round
III in the WCC conference tournament final in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope we'll get there," Westphal said. "I'm sure Gonzaga will
get there.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they are [the eighth-best team in the country.] I'm a big
fan of theirs. I think they're really good."</TE>
<TE>   It was a game full of intensity and more than a little
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine was assessed a technical for illegal substitution at
the start of the second half after Westphal started a different
lineup than the official scorer recorded, although Westphal said he
sent two people to the table with a lineup that inserted Glen McGowan
and Craig Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   "I sent an assistant coach and a manager and told them and they
wrote it down wrong," Westphal said. "I'm not saying he's cheating,
but something's wrong with that rule. You should not be penalized if
the home scorer writes it down wrong."</TE>
<TE>   There was another official scorer's issue involving a basket
credited to Pepperdine's Robert Turner that should have been credited
to Dickau. However, the official scorebook stands--and a closer game
would have made for a bigger controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Dickau officially scored 26 points--including four three-pointers
and 14 of 15 free throws--and added seven assists.</TE>
<TE>   But one of the differences in the game was rebounding.</TE>
<TE>   In Pepperdine's 88-79 victory last month, the Waves outrebounded
Gonzaga by 14 and had 24 offensive rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Gonzaga won the battle of the boards by 13.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine didn't shoot well in the first half, making only 37%,
but improved in the second half to finish at 42.9%.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves also struggled uncharacteristically from the line,
making only 18 of 32 free throws (56.3%). Gonzaga made 33 of 42
(78.6%).</TE>
<TE>   McGowan scored 26 points and Jimmy Miggins added 17.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves tried to rally and had their chances, but Lewis and
Boomer Brazzle missed shots when they had an opportunity to make the
score close.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine's winning streak was ended at 13 games. It had been the
longest in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   It was a big-game atmosphere for a Pepperdine team that still
hasn't developed much of a public identity despite splashy upsets
over UCLA, USC and Gonzaga.</TE>
<TE>   They're mostly known simply as the team coached by Westphal, the
easy-going coach on a forced NBA sabbatical with a great office view.</TE>
<TE>   That's partly because Pepperdine's lacks a dominant player.</TE>
<TE>   Miggins, a transfer from L.A. City College, is the leading scorer,
averaging about 15 points. But he is only one of six players who have
led Pepperdine in scoring and one of four averaging in low double
figures.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Devin Montgomery, another player in that core group, is a
transfer from Moorpark College.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't matter amid the hubbub of senior night.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so emotional," Gonzaga Coach Mark Few said. "I'm crying on
the sidelines, then we've got to get in there and scratch and claw.
But I knew with Dan we'd be all right."</TE>

<HD>Bettors Having Trouble Getting Out of the Gate</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Opening an Internet account with a credit
card has proved to be troublesome for many on new systems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Customers who have had trouble launching Internet accounts with the
newly legalized horse-betting systems in California should know that
the difficulty might lie with their credit-card companies; many of
them have a policy that prohibits cash transfers to gambling-related
businesses.</LD>
<LD>   It's more of a sure bet that a horseplayer will be able to funnel
credit-card advances into his racing account if he uses the telephone
instead of the Internet. Both means of betting were legalized here as
of Jan. 1, and last month the California Horse Racing Board approved
the licenses of the Television Games Network and XpressBet, which are
owned by companies that have been taking horse bets in other states.
The racing board is expected to consider applications for other
licenses at its meeting Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   A reporter for The Times, attempting to start an account with
XpressBet on the Internet, was unable to move money from a credit
card into his horse account. But when he tried to do the same thing
on the phone, talking to a live XpressBet representative, the
credit-card transfer was approved.</LD>
<TE>   David Webster, a spokesman for First Card Visa, said that since
last fall his company has had a policy that prohibits an Internet
user from taking available credit and sending funds into a gambling
account.</TE>
<TE>   "We no longer accept Internet gambling transactions," Webster
said, "because of the high-risk nature of these transactions and to
protect our card members from fraud. This was a business decision and
consistent with the practices of other credit-card issuers."</TE>
<TE>   Asked why The Times reporter was able to do business with his
credit card over the phone with XpressBet, Webster said:</TE>
<TE>   "Our fraud people tell me that statistically it's not as risky [to
allow a cash transfer] over the phone as it is by Internet. It's less
likely that someone using the phone will be making a call to the
Bahamas."</TE>
<TE>   One of the arguments the racing industry made to obtain phone and
Internet betting in California was that it needed to compete with
offshore betting concerns in the Bahamas and elsewhere. Estimates
vary wildly, but it has been said that as much as $50 million a year
is bet offshore and overseas on California races.</TE>
<TE>   Officials for Magna Entertainment Corp., which owns XpressBet,
Santa Anita and several other racetracks, declined to comment about
the bettor's inability to start a horse account with a credit card
through  the Internet. Other ways of starting an XpressBet account
are by cash at a sign-up booth at Santa Anita or by mail with a
certified check.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks ago, a customer with a Television Games Network (TVG)
betting account also was unable, with a Bank of America credit card,
to send funds into that account using the Internet. Speaking on the
phone to a TVG operator at a betting hub in Oregon, he explained his
problem and she said that there was a way of moving the money from
his credit card to TVG so that the credit-card issuer wouldn't
recognize the transaction as gambling-related. Then the transaction
was completed.</TE>
<TE>   "That could be fraud," Webster said, but he preferred that further
comments come from someone at Visa USA.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman there referred a reporter to Katherine Pulley, a
spokeswoman for the American Bankers Assn., a Washington trade group
that says it represents more banks than any other organization.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's fraud, it's fraud," Pulley said. "This has been a major
point of a debate regarding an Internet gambling bill that's been
kicking around Congress for several years. Right now, enforcement
rests with the banks."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Wilson, president of TVG, said that the industry should do a
better job of convincing credit-card companies that betting on horses
over the Internet is legal in California as well as many other
states.</TE>
<TE>   "We're 100% legal in the eyes of the federal government and the
State of California," Wilson said. "The distinction between what
we're doing and what the offshore companies are doing is enormous.
There's so much of a gray area when it comes to the offshore guys."</TE>
<TE>   More and more, credit-card companies are staying away from
transactions that involve casino betting and wagering on horse races.
There have been court decisions that have forced them into this
position. In California, according to a report in the New York Times,
a woman lost $100,000 gambling, but a court ruled that she was not
responsible. There is also the story about a gambler losing $1,500 in
Internet roulette and then insisting that the money was fraudulently
removed from his credit-card account.</TE>
<TE>   Many years ago, in a small-claims court in Los Angeles, there was
a suit brought by a bookmaker--in an illegal profession--against a
client who owed him several thousand dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The judge was about to order that the debt be paid, but then he
learned that the money represented losing bets on horses and sporting
events. Saying that gambling debts were unenforceable, the judge
ruled in favor of the defendant. The fact that the plaintiff was a
bookie never came up.</TE>

<HD>Board Lays Down the Law When Differentiating Ads</HD>

<LD>The California Horse Racing Board, with the cooperation of broadcast
and newspaper publishing groups in the state, has sent notices to all
radio and television stations and newspapers in California, advising
them of the legalities in carrying betting-related advertising.</LD>
<LD>   "While fully respecting the right of private businesses to manage
their own affairs," the notice says in part, "the board believes that
it is in the interest of the horse-racing industry and the media to
maintain both the fact and the appearance of full compliance with the
laws that regulate wagering. The CHRB, therefore, requests that you
decline to carry advertising for any unlicensed betting operation
that violates wagering laws, California statues in particular."</LD>
<LD>   Last month the racing board approved the licenses of two companies
to take bets on horse racing through the Internet and by telephone.</LD>
<TE>   In cooperating with the racing board, the California Broadcasters
Assn. has sent this advisory to its members: "....If you are running
ads for sports betting, online gaming or any other type of Internet
or telephone gambling besides horse racing for these two entities,
then you are in violation of the law."</TE>
<TE>   Also cooperating with the racing board is the California Newspaper
Publishers Assn. The racing board also sent notices to national
publications and radio networks. One of the board's targets would
appear to be the Daily Racing Form, based in New York and widely
distributed in California. In Saturday's issue, the Racing Form
carried 12 ads for six dot-com betting companies that have not been
licensed by the racing board.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Crist, publisher of the Racing Form, said Friday night that
he hadn't seen the racing board's notice.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly no one else has taken this approach," Crist said.
"Everyone's entitled to their opinion, and frequently a lot of people
will have different opinions. If need be, we'll seek legal counsel. I
would be hard-pressed to say how much of this type of advertising we
carry. It is not the largest kind of advertising we have, by any
means."</TE>
<TE>   The general policy of The Times is not to carry gambling
advertising.</TE>

<HD>Covina Northview Wrestles to Title</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Yoon;Dan Arritt</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This time, the real Covina Northview wrestling team stood up.</LD>
<LD>   After coming under fire for sending a junior varsity squad to the
Southern Section dual meet championships last week, Northview showed
its true colors Saturday night with a resounding 23-point victory
against Santa Ana in the Eastern Division individual championships at
Norte Vista High in Riverside.</LD>
<LD>   Northview, which held out its varsity last week in order to
prepare for the individual championships, set a school individual
championship record with 219 points and got weight-class victories
from Sammy Saunders at 112 pounds, James Clay at 160 and David De La
Fuente at 171.</LD>
<TE>   It is the second individual championship for Northview, which won
in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings, who also had three wrestlers finish second in what
was considered the toughest of the six divisional championships, had
a meet-best nine wrestlers finish in the top five, thus advancing to
the Masters meet.</TE>
<TE>   Clay, who had three pins, a technical fall and a major decision,
said the criticism aimed at Northview last week inspired his team all
week.</TE>
<TE>   "That brought motivation to our practice," Clay said. "Winning
this is great."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana, which got victories from Jair Ramirez at 140 pounds and
Fernando Jaimes at 152, had eight wrestlers qualify for the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Maria Righetti led the tournament with four weight-class
winners: Jaime Rocha at 103, Andrew Domingues at 119, Jesse Rocha at
125 and Mario Arguilles at 130. The Warriors finished third with
117.5 points and will send five to the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Things may have gone differently for Santa Ana if not for a
penalty called against Hugo Guzman in the 103-pound final. Guzman and
Rocha went to double overtime and Rocha won when Guzman was assessed
a penalty for locking his hands.</TE>
<TE>   "That was big," Santa Ana Coach Scott Glabb said. "That would have
made this a little closer."</TE>

<TE>   In girls' water polo:</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Wilson 8, Lake Forest El Toro 7--The Bruins held
fourth-seeded El Toro scoreless the final 13 minutes while overcoming
a four-goal deficit in a Division I quarterfinal game at El Toro
High.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson (18-9) took an 8-7 lead on a goal by freshman Lauren Silver
with 3:41 remaining and its defense clamped down the rest of the way,
stopping a man-advantage situation with 1:59 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers (20-9), No. 4 in The Times' rankings, didn't get the
ball back until the final seconds as El Toro goalkeeper Erin
Greenberg deflected Adriane Mota's shot over the goal with 1:16
remaining and the Bruins then drew an ejection with 44 seconds left,
resetting the 35-second shot clock.</TE>
<TE>   Silver scored four goals to lead eighth-ranked Wilson, which will
play top-seeded Santa Margarita in the semifinals Wednesday at a site
to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Arritt</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino 9, Redlands 8--Alison Riddle scored her second goal
with four seconds remaining to give San Bernardino (23-6) the victory
at Riverside Arlington High. Goalkeeper Alison Lane's 13th save and
outlet pass to Riddle set up the winning shot.</TE>
<TE>   In girls' soccer:</TE>
<TE>   Newport Harbor 3, Irvine University 1 (OT)--Alec Mills' goal early
in the second half gave visiting University a 1-0 lead, but Amy Ross
scored in the 53rd minute for the tie, then had goals in each of the
10-minute overtime periods for the sixth-ranked Sailors in a Division
II playoff game.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There are two ways of looking at the slate of World Cup warmup games
that took place around the world last week.</LD>
<LD>   One way is through American eyes, viewing only the national team's
better-than-expected performance Wednesday in a 1-0 loss to Italy at
Catania, Sicily. It seems 2002 might not be 1998 all over again.
Certainly, the Americans looked quite comfortable, at least until the
Italians turned up the pressure in the second half.</LD>
<LD>   The other way is with a global perspective, trying to assess which
of the eight countries with a realistic chance of winning the World
Cup has its act together this early.</LD>
<TE>   Thirty-two nations qualified for the May 31-June 30 finals in
South Korea and Japan. Three-quarters of them needn't bother buying
any silver cleaner.</TE>
<TE>   They won't be taking the World Cup home.</TE>
<TE>   Seven of the remaining eight played on Wednesday--the only
exception being Brazil--and here is what their respective coaches
said:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Argentina</TE>
<TE>   Marcelo Bielsa is an optimist.</TE>
<TE>   "We had enough of the ball and I think we created enough chances
to have won by two clear goals," he said of the World Cup
co-favorites' 1-1 tie with Wales in Cardiff that extended Argentina's
unbeaten string to 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though some players were missing, and there were some new
faces playing, this was a genuine representation of the Argentine
team."</TE>
<TE>   The real test for Bielsa's squad, however, will come in April when
it plays Germany, the team it defeated in the 1986 World Cup final in
Mexico City and lost to in the 1990 final in Rome.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   England</TE>
<TE>   Sven-Goran Eriksson used England's game against the Netherlands at
Amsterdam to experiment with a 4-3-3 formation for the first time
since the Swede became England's coach. The result was a 1-1 tie.</TE>
<TE>   "We had 10 matches last year, but I never felt it was the right
time to break up the traditional 4-4-2," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The players adjusted well. It was a much better performance today
than it was last August when we played 4-4-2 [in a 2-0 loss to the
Dutch]. It was a good game, and while Holland had more possession, we
threatened more and with a little bit of luck we could have won."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Germany</TE>
<TE>   Rudi Voeller believes the German team has regained its confidence
after last year's humiliating 5-1 home loss to England.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, its 7-1 demolition of Israel at Kaiserslautern has the
three-time world champions thinking more positively about Korea/Japan
'02.</TE>
<TE>   "Seven goals in one half against Israel is something," Voeller
said. "They're not a weak team and they got close to qualifying for
the World Cup against Austria."</TE>
<TE>   Voeller was even more pleased that Germany came from behind to
win: "Even at one-down, we didn't get frantic. We just bided our
time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Spain</TE>
<TE>   Jose Antonio Camacho tried an unusual tactic in Barcelona, where
Spain had to come from behind to tie Portugal, 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Ignoring his veteran players, Camacho selected a midfield that
featured three young players: Xavi, 22, Vicente, 20 and Joaquin
Sanchez, 20.</TE>
<TE>   "The youngsters played with real freedom and desire, which means
they want to play for the national team," Camacho said.</TE>
<TE>   He then echoed a thought shared by all coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "I just I hope I make the right decisions when I come to choose
the World Cup squad," he said. World Cup rosters have to be selected
by May 21.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Portugal</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Oliveira has more to worry about these days than the tie
with Spain.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, backup goalkeeper Joaquim Silva, who played one half of
that match, tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone for the
second time and faces a suspension of at least three months, which
could keep him out of the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Silva has denied taking any drugs. Portugal will be the U.S.
team's most difficult opponent in South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Oliveira, who said before the Spain game that "we can match
anyone," wasn't overly impressed by the match. "I didn't think either
side deserved to win," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   France</TE>
<TE>   Roger Lemerre was left unhappy by the defending world and European
champions' performance in a 2-1 victory over Romania in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm perplexed," he said. "It's the first time I've found it hard
to analyze a match. The first 20 minutes were disappointing in the
way we played as a team. I'll need to review all this."</TE>
<TE>   The absence of injured playmaker Zinedine Zidane was particularly
noticeable.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Italy</TE>
<TE>   Giovanni Trapattoni was even more displeased than Lemerre,
slamming the Italians' lackluster showing against the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "Putting on the blue shirt of Italy is like being a Formula One
driver," he told Gazzetta dello Sport.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to always go at 320 kilometers per hour. If you are
cruising and you lose concentration, you risk ending up off the
track."</TE>
<TE>   Italy's next warmup game is at England on March 27.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brazil</TE>
<TE>   Felipe Scolari's four-time world champions did not play last week,
having started their World Cup preparations earlier with a 6-0
victory over Bolivia and a 1-0 victory over Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   None of Brazil's leading European-based players was used in either
game.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil plays Chile on March 7, but has more meaningful warmup
matches against Yugoslavia on March 27 and against Portugal in Lisbon
on April 17.</TE>
<TE>   "The game against Portugal will be the big test," Pele wrote in
January in a column in the Brazilian newspaper O Globo.</TE>
<TE>   "I have already tipped this team, with the likes of Luis Figo and
Rui Costa, as one of the strongest contenders to win the World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   That, of course, is just what U.S. Coach Bruce Arena wanted to
hear.</TE>

<LD>Andy Beal was on the verge of pitching the United States to the gold
medal at the World Youth Baseball Championships in Veracruz, Mexico,
last August, so he consulted with teammates in the dugout on how to
celebrate.</LD>
<LD>   "I was going to do the Ben Sheets thing, where he drops to his
knees and raises his hands," Beal said. "And I did."</LD>
<LD>   After the final out, Beal gave his championship pose, then was
engulfed by delirious 15- and 16-year-old teammates. He turned in a
pitching performance to cherish, striking out 14 and allowing five
hits in a 6-2 victory over Venezuela.</LD>
<TE>   His fastball was clocked as high as 93 mph. It was reminiscent of
Sheets, who pitched the United States to a 4-0 upset of Cuba in the
2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike Sheets, who became a starting pitcher for the Milwaukee
Brewers the next season, Beal isn't quite ready for the major
leagues.</TE>
<TE>   He's a 16-year-old sophomore right-hander at Palos Verdes
Peninsula High. Last month, he got his driver's license. Next month,
he'll try to prove that his dominating summer form was no fluke.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot more confidence," Beal said. "Now I know I can
compete against the best."</TE>
<TE>   Beal is 5 feet 11 and 190 pounds, with an engaging smile and
deceiving grit. He'll look you in the eye, act friendly and polite,
but put him in a competition, whether it's baseball or PlayStation 2,
and he'll settle for nothing but success.</TE>
<TE>   "I like showing up people who think they're going to win and try
to get in your head," he said. "I like showing them they can't get in
my head."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Roger Carroll of Peninsula learned last season that Beal was
no ordinary freshman.</TE>
<TE>   In the season opener, Beal struck out all six batters in two
innings of relief. He earned the team's No. 1 starting role, going
7-3 with a 1.76 earned-run average and 77 strikeouts in 472/3
innings. He threw a shutout in the Panthers' Division I playoff
opener against Long Beach Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's kind of intimidating for a lot of hitters because he
throws the ball harder than 98% of the pitchers around, so the ball
gets on you in a hurry, and he has control," Carroll said. "He's very
cool on the mound. I think players like Andy come along once in a
career."</TE>
<TE>   Beal's freshman season ended with a test of adversity. He
discovered in a 13-3 playoff loss to Upland that he's hittable.
Suddenly, he was a lonely 15-year-old standing on the mound searching
for answers.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to throw it by the hitters," he said. "They were a good
team. I learned everyone has their off days. I felt pretty bad, more
because it was the last game for the seniors, and I felt I had let
them down."</TE>
<TE>   The seniors, however, didn't blame him.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, man, it's OK. You tried. Get me tickets when you're in the
pros," a senior pitcher told Beal.</TE>
<TE>   Beal didn't dwell on the loss. He wasn't always so mature.</TE>
<TE>   "In Little League, I used to go crazy when we lost," he said. "I'd
get so mad. Now it's just a game. You win the next one."</TE>
<TE>   He went to Houston last summer to try out for the U.S. youth
national team. He made the team and found himself on the mound in the
gold-medal game before several thousand vocal fans in Veracruz.</TE>
<TE>   "It was real intense," he said. "If you throw one ball, they'll
boo you. If you walk someone, they'll start yelling stuff. But if you
strike out someone, they'll love you."</TE>
<TE>   Beal was just trying to keep his team in the game. Instead, he
lasted all nine innings with a pitching performance teammates won't
soon forget.</TE>
<TE>   "He threw awesome," said infielder Chris Valaika, a junior at
Newhall Hart who assisted on the game's final out.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the greatest thing I've ever seen. I've never been in a
game where someone who's so young went that strong for nine innings.
He was in a league of his own."</TE>
<TE>   Beal throws his fastball consistently between 89 and 91 mph. He
also has command of a curveball and changeup.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably the best pitcher I've ever played against," said
Chatsworth sophomore Jason Dominguez, a club teammate of Beal. "He's
so fluid. He's what I want to be. When I first met him, he was a
fastball pitcher. Now he's an all-around pitcher instead of a
thrower. He's as humble as you can be."</TE>
<TE>   You'll never hear Beal bragging about himself, except when he
beats friends in PlayStation 2.</TE>
<TE>   He has the same baseball dreams of anyone his age--to play in the
major leagues. "It would be sweet," he said. "All my family and
friends would want tickets."</TE>
<TE>   That's the least of his concerns. He has teenage priorities, such
as convincing his father to let him drive around the neighborhood in
his car.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach State Fights for Win at Northridge</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their coach might only have a number of games left, but the Long
Beach State 49ers are showing they still have plenty of fight.</LD>
<LD>   Travis Reed had game-highs of 19 points and 13 rebounds as Long
Beach withstood a second-half rally for the second consecutive game
in defeating Cal State Northridge, 73-60, Saturday night before 1,412
at Northridge.</LD>
<LD>   The 49ers, 10-16 overall and 6-9 in the Big West Conference,
clinched a berth in the conference tournament in winning their fourth
in six games. They have also won two of three since sixth-year Coach
Wayne Morgan announced he would resign at the end of the season.</LD>
<TE>   Much like Thursday's victory at Pacific, the 49ers saw a big lead
whittle away but composed themselves and made all the key plays down
the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've improved and have grown as a team," Morgan said.</TE>
<TE>   "In previous games, we have not been able to fight teams off.
Basketball is a game of runs and once the other goes on theirs,
you've got to be able to come right back with one to succeed."</TE>
<TE>   Vance Lawhorn's three-point play gave Long Beach its biggest lead
at 57-40 with 10:41 remaining. But Jermar Welch scored eight of his
16 points in a 17-2 run that got the Matadors (8-15, 7-7) within two
with 3:33 left.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach didn't break. Lawhorn, who had 13 points, had a key
three-point play for a 63-57 lead and the 49ers held Northridge to
only one field goal the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always known Vance could score," Reed said. "Now with Rudy
[Williams] out, Vance has had to step up and he did. Every time he
gets in the game, he scores or does something else."</TE>
<TE>   Northridge, which was in a tie for first place on Jan. 26, has
lost five in a row.</TE>

<TE>   Pacific 73, UC Irvine 61--Maurice McLemore scored 12 of his 17
points in the second half at Stockton to help the Tigers (15-9, 7-7)
knock Irvine (18-8, 11-4) out of first place in the Big West.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan Harris scored a game-high 18 points for Irvine, but Jerry
Green, the Big West's leading scorer and reigning conference Player
of the Year, was limited to 10 points, half his season average.</TE>
<TE>   Utah State 59, UC Riverside 42--Desmond Penigar scored 18 points
and Tony Brown added 12 points and six assists to lead the Aggies at
Logan, Utah.</TE>
<TE>   The Aggies (20-4, 12-3), who have won seven games in a row,
secured their third consecutive 20-win season with the victory.</TE>
<TE>   UC Riverside (5-9, 8-14) got 13 points and six rebounds from Vili
Morton, but the Highlanders shot just 26%.</TE>
<TE>   Idaho 65, Cal State Fullerton 53--Matt Gerschefske scored 17
points to lead the Vandals at Moscow, Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   The Vandals (9-15, 6-9) were able to offset the superior size of
the Titans (4-19, 1-13).</TE>
<TE>   Against 6-foot-10 Pape Sow, who had a game-high 19 points and 10
rebounds, and 6-11 Babacar Camara, Idaho found open shots from
three-point range, making 41.7%, and outrebounded Fullerton, 31-23.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 83, Loyola Marymount 79--Casey Frandsen had six
three-pointers and scored 25 points as the Pilots won in overtime in
a West Coast Conference game at Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Coky Rochin added 17 points for Portland (6-20, 2-10), which had
lost 16 of 17 before beating the Lions.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola (9-17, 2-10), which fell into a last-place tie in the
conference with Portland and St. Mary's, was led by Kent Dennis with
21 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Pilots nearly let the game slip away in the second half, when
Loyola went on a 13-1 run to take a 68-61 lead with 5:56 remaining.
But the Lions failed to score in the final 3:30 of regulation,
opening the door for the Pilots.</TE>

<LD>Georgia Coach Jim Harrick wasn't sure what to expect from Ezra
Williams in the Bulldogs' big game against Kentucky on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Williams had been grieving the death of his brother, Antwonne, who
was shot in the Atlanta area the Saturday before.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe Ezra won't snap out of it," Harrick said. "Without him,
we're certainly not nearly as good as we should be and could be."</LD>
<TE>   As it turned out, No. 21 Georgia got plenty from Williams as the
junior guard, who averages 17.2 points, made sure he was a factor by
scoring 20 points in a 78-69 victory over No. 10 Kentucky at Athens,
Ga.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been real emotional this week," Williams said. "I spent a
lot of time with my family and some of them were at the game today.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to focus on basketball. That's what my brother would have
wanted me to do. I wasn't going to let us lose the game."</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs (19-7, 8-5 Southeastern) avoided losing their third
consecutive and completed a regular-season sweep of the Wildcats for
the first time since 1986-87.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No class at all: As Iowa's season slips away, it would be easy for
Coach Steve Alford to lose his focus.</TE>
<TE>   But it's apparent that he hasn't and he made it clear Saturday
that he won't allow his players to do so either despite a 72-66 loss
at home to Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   Alford benched Reggie Evans, the Big Ten's leading rebounder
(11.5) and the Hawkeyes' No. 2 scorer (16.3), because the senior has
been skipping class.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope the message is simple and clear," Alford said. "If you are
going to play in our Iowa basketball program, you are a student
before an athlete. I thought that message had to be sent. I messed up
by not sending it earlier."</TE>
<TE>   Alford certainly earned the praises of Ohio State Coach Jim
O'Brien.</TE>
<TE>   "I tip my hat to Steve Alford," O'Brien said. "There was
absolutely no question about the importance of this game to Iowa, and
for him to demonstrate, I think, courage for standing by what he
thinks is the right thing by not playing his best player is a credit
to him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right at home: If nothing else, Coach Bo Ryan has the proper
pedigree for success at Wisconsin, having coached previously at
Wisconsin Platteville and Wisconsin Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Bennett, who coached the Badgers from 1996-2000 and led them
to three NCAA tournament appearances including a Final Four, paid his
dues at Wisconsin Stevens Point and Wisconsin Green Bay before coming
to Madison.</TE>
<TE>   As Bennett eventually did, Ryan seems to be pushing the right
buttons in his first season. On Saturday, the Badgers used a 30-point
effort from Kirk Penney in a 67-62 victory over Minnesota at
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin (16-11, 9-5 Big Ten), which upset Indiana on Wednesday,
is in third place behind Ohio State and the Hoosiers, and seems to be
gearing toward a strong finish after a 3-6 start.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Badgers' first victory at Indiana in 25 years,
Wisconsin also ended Michigan State's 53-game home winning streak
earlier this season.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the big week of victories, Ryan already was making his
case for a tournament bid.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think that if you're 9-7 in a league that is one of the
best leagues in the country year in and year out, it's got to make
some kind of statement for you," Ryan told the Milwaukee Journal
Sentinel when the team was 7-5 in conference.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A real long shot: It's becoming more and more apparent that Luke
McDonald is a streaky shooter.</TE>
<TE>   The Drake sophomore, who was the Missouri Valley Conference
freshman of the year last season, scored 27 points and made all 12 of
his free throws Saturday in a 68-54 victory over Bradley. He even
scored 12 points in a row in a 4:45 span of the first half.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald has made 25 consecutive free throws, but more
impressively he extended his school-record streak of making a
three-point basket to 53 consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA record is held by Cory Bradford of Illinois, who made at
least one three-point shot in 88 consecutive games from Nov. 10,
1998, to Feb. 10, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pure and simple: After the Pacific 10 Conference succumbed to the
dollar signs of what a conference tournament can bring, it left the
Ivy League as the nation's only Division I holdout.</TE>
<TE>   The Ivy still determines its automatic NCAA tournament bid on
winning the regular-season championship.</TE>
<TE>   And with two weeks left, Yale remains in the driver's seat for its
first Ivy League title since 1962 after a 76-56 victory at Columbia.
The Bulldogs were led by freshman Edwin Draughan, a former Lakewood
Mayfair High standout, who scored 20 points as Yale (17-7, 9-1) won
its seventh in a row.</TE>
<TE>   But the big test comes next Friday and Saturday when the Bulldogs
go on the road to play Princeton and Pennsylvania, teams they already
have defeated.</TE>
<TE>   Between them, Princeton and Penn account for the last 13 Ivy
League championships and 32 of the last 34.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Home cooking: We all know how tough it is to be the road team in
places like Durham, N.C., Eugene, Ore., and Lawrence, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   But Boiling Springs, N.C.?</TE>
<TE>   That might be college basketball's next hot spot after Gardner
Webb won its 29th in a row at home in an 86-79 victory over Texas Pan
American.</TE>
<TE>   The Runnin' Bulldogs streak, which dates to the 1999-2000 season,
is the second longest active streak in Division I behind Brigham
Young's 33 in a row.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Block party: Louisiana Monroe center Wojciech Myrda broke the NCAA
record for career blocked shots in a 90-73 victory over Nicholls
State.</TE>
<TE>   Myrda, a 7-foot-2 senior from Rzeszow, Poland, had 11 and raised
his career total to 502, breaking the mark of 492 set by Colgate's
Adonal Foyle from 1995-97.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Out of action: Utah Coach Rick Majerus missed Saturday's game
against Air Force because of a bronchial infection and high fever.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant coach Dick Hunsaker ran the team as the Utes defeated
the Falcons, 59-51.</TE>
<TE>   Majerus also missed Friday's practice and made a brief appearance
at the shootaround Saturday before deciding an hour before tipoff not
to stay for the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Performance of the day: Brandon Hunter of Ohio scored 27 points
and had a career-high 22 rebounds in the Bobcats' 71-66 victory
against Marshall. It was Ohio's first victory at Huntington, W.Va.,
since 1984.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Performance of the weak: Chicago State slipped to 2-22 after a
57-35 loss to Southern Utah. The Cougars made only 14 of 45 shots and
had 27 turnovers. The 35 points was a school-record low.</TE>

<LD>Thursday at California, 7 p.m., Fox Sports Net 2--Less acclaimed than
the five ranked Pacific 10 Conference teams, Cal remains in the hunt
for the title. Freshman Amit Tamir scored 39 points in a victory over
Oregon a week ago. UCLA defeated the Bears, 64-57, at Pauley Pavilion
on Jan. 26 behind Jason Kapono's 17 points.</LD>

<LD>Aisha Hollans scored 19 points as USC used late-game free throws to
defeat Arizona, 71-64, Saturday, at Tucson.</LD>
<LD>   Despite leading the entire game, USC, 14-11 overall and 10-6 in
the Pacific 10 Conference, found itself in trouble in the final
minutes when Arizona used three consecutive three-point baskets to
cut the Trojan lead to 63-59 with 1:36 remaining.</LD>
<LD>   After Jessica Cheeks made a two free throws, Arizona's Dee-Dee
Wheeler made a three-pointer to cut USC's lead to 65-62 with 1:05
remaining.</LD>
<TE>   However, a pair of free throws from Cheeks and Rachel Woodward

<LD>Sorry, but I'm not even briefly infatuated with the design of the
new Walt Disney Concert Hall ("A Lasting Love Affair or a Brief
Infatuation?" Metropolis, by James Ricci, Jan. 20). The Opera House in
Sydney is beautiful, and I can deal with the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao,
but the Disney hall will always look like a bunch of trash swept into a
pile after a Magic Kingdom parade.</LD>

<TE>   *   Ricci's article deals with the exterior of the building and glides
over the interior as though it is of no importance. He buys into and
supports the trendy but sad notion that architecture is sculpture, that
its main function is to decorate the skyline. If it is original,
creative, sensationalistic, eye-catching and self-serving, it's not
merely OK; it's terrific.</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to know what Ricci has to say about the interior of the
concert hall. Frank Gehry has designed seats behind and to the sides of
the orchestra, defying tradition (which in itself is not always bad) and
creating a bizarre situation internally. To what end?</TE>
<TE>   Fashions in architecture are as certain as fashions in couture, albeit
the cycle is somewhat longer. Some of us hope that the current cycle of
deconstructed, self-aggrandizing architecture is the shortest on record.</TE>

<LD>J. R. Moehringer touched my heart and fed my soul with the story
about Marion Pritchard and her true heroism ("A Hidden and Solitary
Soldier," Jan. 20). What a bonus for humanity she is. Thank you for
sharing her inspiring story. I hope there are still many parents who are
perpetuating the foundations for such courage, imbuing their children
with an "exquisite sense of justice" and "unwavering self-confidence."
Such people enrich us all.</LD>

always on the fringes of show business, got his publicity and we got the

<LD>I found the story on Julia Butterfly Hill ("Butterfly's Hard
Landing," by Matthew Heller, Jan. 20) feverishly thought provoking.
Although I consider myself a conservative in many ways, dismissing her as
an infatuated tree hugger is something I am no longer capable of. I
admire her dedication and her ability to draw media attention. She is
still quite young, and therefore hard to fault, but her case represents a
problem in the activist population.</LD>
<LD>   The article displayed the phenomenal ineptitude of the environmental
protection movement. That these people fight each other--while supporting
the same cause--is as ridiculous as it is sad. A perfect example is
labeling someone who lived in a tree for two years as a "sellout." As
long as environmentalists maliciously criticize and question the motives
of their allies, they will achieve nothing.</LD>

<TE>   *   I was beguiled by Hill's dedication, strength and perseverance in
her goal to save Luna. However, I fail to see the connection between a
glorious example of nature's best and a cold-blooded murderer such as
Mumia Abu-Jamal. Can't someone support environmental causes and animal
rights and not fall into the "Ed Asner/Susan Sarandon white guilt club"?</TE>

<HD>A Call for Hands-Free Cell-Phone Use</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>Forgive Assemblyman Joe Simitian if he's a little frustrated. For
the past year, the Palo Alto Democrat has been championing legislation
that would require California drivers to use hands-free devices when
talking on cell phones, and wireless companies have managed twice to
strangle his proposal in the Transportation Committee by a single vote.</LD>
<LD>   Simitian is undaunted, however. He's prepared yet another measure
designed to discourage us 11 million cell phoners here from hurtling
through space in a ton or two of steel with Nokias at our ears,
distraction on our faces and only one paw on our steering wheels.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it would pass off the Assembly floor, because it's something
that I think there is public support for," Simitian says. "I don't think
we need a lot to tell us that if you're holding a cell phone with one
hand, you're not really in control of your vehicle. The first thing they
teach kids when they take driver training is, 'Keep both hands on the
wheel.' " Simitian fans his ardor with a sheaf of studies that support
his point, most specifically a California Highway Patrol survey compiled
during the first six months of last year. The survey implicated cell
phone use in more collisions, 341, than any other so-called driver
"inattention," such as CD and radio use (316), child-related distractions
(121) and eating (94).</LD>
<TE>   It goes without saying that dialing a cell phone while driving is
seriously distracting (since acquiring a cell phone six months ago, I've
nearly rear-ended other cars a half dozen times while tapping out
numbers). Whether the use of hands-free devices prevents accidents is a
separate question, and still arguable.</TE>
<TE>   At the University of Utah, a team of psychologists recently studied 48
undergraduates in controlled conditions. The students were put before
computer screens, given joysticks and told to keep a cursor as closely
aligned as possible with a smoothly moving target. Whenever the cursor
flashed red, participants were to immediately press "brake" buttons on
the top of the joysticks. While performing the task, half the subjects
listened to the radio (and, later, books on tape), and the other half
talked on cell phones with persons in another room. Half of the
cell-phoners used hand-held devices, and half hands-free instruments.</TE>
<TE>   Cell-phoners proved more than twice as likely to miss flashing red
lights than the radio- and books-on-tape listeners. Also, they were
slower in responding to the red lights they did see. More to the point,
this was equally true for hand-held and hands-free phoners.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers wanted to zero in on what aspect of cell-phone use
most interfered with driving ability. Accordingly, they had the
cell-phoners navigate two simulated driving courses, one easy and one
difficult. Meanwhile, half were made to repeat words spoken to them over
their cell phones, while the other half were given a "word generation"
task, namely, to come up with words that began with the last letters of
words spoken to them over the phones.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers found that those tasked with word generation erred
significantly more often in navigating the course, especially on the more
difficult course. Thus, the study indicated, upholding one's end of a
conversation was more of a potential hazard than just listening to a
co-conversant.</TE>
<TE>   Cell-phone conversations apparently are more distracting than in-car
conversations between automobile occupants. The researchers referred to
earlier studies that indicated in-person chats tend to fall off when a
driver encounters difficult driving conditions. "By contrast," they
write, "at least one of the participants in a cellular-phone conversation
is unaware of the current driving conditions."</TE>
<TE>   The upshot of the study is that the real danger probably isn't the
number of hands a cell-phoner has on the wheel, but talking on a cell
phone, period. Personally, I almost always use a hands-free device when
cell-phoning in my car. Even so, I have to admit that, while I'm
discussing details of a future trip with a friend, or trying to persuade
my mother to move to a retirement home, my perception of minutes and
miles melts away. I wonder what other perceptions do, too.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Simitian doesn't see such evidence as the Utah study as inimical
to his legislative goal. "If people are going to be distracted by
cell-phone conversations, even if they're using a hands-free device, it's
even more important that they have both hands on the wheel," he says.
Legislation is no panacea for human incaution, but it does get our
attention. Witness the seat belt law. Maybe a hands-free law will be a
concrete first step toward getting drivers to reconsider cell-phoning
itself. The next time I'm on a narrow, twisting canyon road and some
monstrous SUV comes careening toward me with a one-handed driver clearly
more interested in the cell phone clapped to his ear than the location of
the center line, I know I'll be earnestly wishing Simitian luck.</TE>

<HD>Being Benjamin Franklin</HD>

<AU>HANK ROSENFELD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least one wag has credited Benjamin Franklin with inventing "the
lightning rod, the hoax and the republic." Actor Phil Soinski reinvents
Ben Franklin five days a week at the International Printing Museum in
Carson, home to one of the world's largest collections of antique
printing machinery. The museum displays Egyptian papyrus, antique Chinese
printing blocks and other marvels, but the big draw for schoolchildren is
Soinski's one-hour turn as perhaps the most mischievous of America's
founding fathers. For a veteran character actor who played Groucho Marx
for years on stage and television, tossing around phrases such as "the
devil you say!" and "upon my soul!" is all in a day's work.</LD>
<LD>   What makes you a good fit for this role?</LD>
<LD>   I don't need to wear padding at the moment.</LD>
<TE>   How does one create a convincing Ben Franklin?</TE>
<TE>   You eye this modern audience with as much skepticism and curiosity as
they are showing you. It works!</TE>
<TE>   What motivates your character?</TE>
<TE>   I always envision the old gentleman holding a class with his new
students, who may need his help. (It's the teacher in me!) I usually end
with "Class be dismissed!"</TE>
<TE>   Why do children love Ben?</TE>
<TE>   He's got that devilish sense of humor. The majority of the founding
fathers are on a pedestal, but Ben is like one of us.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin sounds like the Kinko's of his day.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, yes. Printing was his love and means to an end toward all those
varied interests he manifested. It made him [one of] America's first
millionaires and allowed him to retire at 42.</TE>
<TE>   So he didn't have to go on "Dost Thou Wishest to Becometh a
Millionaire?"</TE>
<TE>   Pray, it was his industry and franchising of print shops!</TE>
<TE>   Do children think you really are Ben Franklin?</TE>
<TE>   Luckily, many times. They ask, "Aren't you dead?" I feel my pulse and
cheekily respond, "Nay. Genius never dies!"</TE>
<TE>   What do you think about other actors who play Franklin?</TE>
<TE>   There are a lot of impersonators. There are two who are well-known in
Philadelphia, and a gentleman down at Knott's Berry Farm at the
Independence Hall. We're brothers under the skin. Great guy. You expect
actors' insolence but, in this case, everyone is trading off, sharing
information about him. Kent Johnson did it here at the museum for 10
years. He was my mentor.</TE>
<TE>   Inquiring minds want to know: How much of a philanderer was Franklin,
really?</TE>
<TE>   Oh, he did love the ladies. But if any man could partake of a  quarter
of his supposed carryings-on, he'd be in a wicked Valhalla!</TE>
<TE>   How does this gig compare to playing Groucho Marx?</TE>
<TE>   You don't have to bend over when you walk like Franklin.  But they
share a unique humor--one is wry and the other is pumpernickel!</TE>
<TE>   What's the toughest thing about the role?</TE>
<TE>   The wig--it's like wearing a poodle on your head for three hours.</TE>

<LD>From Chinese acrobats to German lion tamers, circus artists speak
the universal language of spectacle and wonder. Circo Fantastico!, the
first U.S.-produced circus with a Latino focus, brought Latin American
music, dance and traditional circus acts to the Southland recently,
celebrating a slightly picante version of big-top magic.</LD>

<HD>A Jackpot for Jazz Fans at Hollywood Park Casino</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For all its hype and bluster, Los Angeles often conceals its
treasures--and it so happens that one of the city's stellar jazz venues
is off the radar screens of most Angelenos. Even inside the Hollywood
Park Casino in Inglewood on a Tuesday night, the brooding gamblers seem
oblivious to the crowd of nearly 200 packed into the Finish Line Sports
Lounge to soak in the fine sounds of multi-reedman John Bolivar and his
quartet.</LD>
<LD>   Fans have been showing up in droves now for five years, since a group
of casino workers hatched the Tuesday After-Work Jazz Cooldown. Live jazz
in L.A. is no sure bet, but the employees dealt a winning hand: top
artists, affordable drinks and no cover. The ace in the hole, says Jazz
Cooldown co-founder Don Bonseigneur, is the jazz devotee. "They're
starving for music," says Bonseigneur, a card dealer known to one and all
as "Duck." The typical Cooldown regular, says co-founder Lettie Nash,
administrative manager to the casino's general manager, is African
American, 55, retired or close to it, and a longtime jazz lover.</LD>
<TE>   Like Duck, the regulars grew up at a time when South L.A. was rich
with legendary haunts that disappeared long ago--the Casbah, the Parisian
Room, Memory Lane. "This is the best thing to hit L.A. since the Parisian
Room," says Darryl Delgado, 52. Seated next to him at the bar is
76-year-old George Taylor, dressed to the nines and sipping his Champagne
and orange juice. "I was here the first night," declares Taylor, a
retired bar manager. "I won't go anywhere else on Tuesday."</TE>
<TE>   The Cooldown draws some of L.A.'s finest jazz artists, a who's who
that includes Barbara Morrison, Teddy Edwards, Ernie Andrews, Poncho
Sanchez, Bobby Rodriguez and others. Along with a nice paycheck, the
Cooldown offers them a rare L.A. commodity--a hard-core jazz audience, at
least those lucky few in the know. "It's the best-kept secret," Nash
says. "But we don't want it to be a secret."</TE>

<HD>'Raw Food Chef' Is No Oxymoron</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARA SCHWARTZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We Southern Californians love our enchiladas--rolled, stacked,
low-fat, meaty, vegetarian, green, red, suiza and mole. Oh, yeah, and
raw.</LD>
<LD>   Chef Lesa Carlson is a raw food advocate who whips up tasty enchiladas
without actually cooking a single ingredient--not to mention pizza,
pasta, burgers and desserts. For at least a decade, Carlson has eaten
only food that's "raw," a strict diet whose proponents eschew all cooking
over 120 degrees Fahrenheit ("warm" range), claiming it kills nutrients
and enzymes and diminishes food's value as an energy source. The benefits
of eating raw include increased health and stamina, proponents say.</LD>
<LD>   "Raw foods have the same structure as your body," claims Carlson, who
was raised vegetarian by a "hippie" mother. "It's an energy exchange. If
you're eating something that's dead and heavy, it's harder for your body
to deal with."</LD>
<TE>   Though "raw food" conjures up images of cold sprouts and lettuce,
Carlson elevates taste and presentation to a rarefied culinary
experience. Twice a month she hosts intimate five-course dinners at the
Rooibos Tea House on Fairfax, featuring all-raw dishes with descriptions
such as "macadamia nut cream ravioli placed delicately on a rich red
sauce, laced with Brazil-walnut pesto" and "squash blossoms stuffed with
a sun-dried tomato-pineapple sage-macadamia nut cream cheese, resting on
sweet yams."</TE>
<TE>   Though some raw food adherents consume unseared meats such as sashimi,
Carlson's menus are 100% vegan (containing no animal products). Each meal
takes a full week to prepare, with Carlson carefully fabricating faux
cheese from macadamia nuts and tortillas out of raw buckwheat and flax
seed. "It's another art form," says Carlson, who also sings with the
extemporaneous jazz quartet Lesa Carlson Off Blue. "It's all about
improvising." But even Carlson will occasionally indulge in a cooked
goodie, albeit one that still puts most diets to shame. "Every once in a
while," she says, "I'll want some tofu."</TE>

<HD>Fretwork From the Land of Flamenco</HD>
<DH>A Masterful Collection of Classical Guitars</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARI TYE RADETSKY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When he bought his first classical guitar about a dozen years ago,
Shel Urlik asked himself: "Should I buy this guitar with the tin can
inside?" The "tin can" turned out to be a tornavoz, a cylinder that
projects sound, and the guitar turned out to be the first in a
world-class collection.</LD>
<LD>   Fitted with nylon strings and played with fingers rather than picks,
classical guitars still derive from techniques perfected by master
luthiers in Spain during the mid-19th century. Until the 1920s, when the
art began to spread, they were known simply as Spanish guitars.</LD>
<LD>   Some connoisseurs would argue that the finest classical guitars ever
are being produced today, but for Urlik, the golden age was the heyday of
the Spanish masters, from the late 1890s to the 1930s. Of his 90 guitars,
many date from this period, including four masterpieces by Antonio de
Torres, classical guitar's Stradivari. Only about 70 to 80 of the
approximately 320 guitars Torres produced exist today. "So few survived,
at least in good shape, because classical guitars were instruments of the
masses," says Urlik, 62. "They were played hard, even by professional
players."</LD>
<TE>   Urlik's collection dates from 1867 to the present and includes guitars
by the Ramirez dynasty and Hermann Hauser, as well as modern masters
Robert Ruck, Dominique Field and Jeffrey R. Elliott. While Spanish
guitars became less heavily decorated in the age of Torres, they remain
works of art; a dazzling instrument crafted by Luis Carzoglio in 1931 is
adorned with more than 70,000 pieces of wood inlay. More than 60 of
Urlik's spectacular pieces are lavishly displayed with extensive
historical notes in a sumptuous volume written by Urlik, "A Collection of
Fine Spanish Guitars from Torres to the Present" (Sunny Knoll Publishing
Co., 1997).</TE>
<TE>   For the L.A. resident, who practices daily on one of his guitars,
collecting grew from his love of playing. "I could be a Laker fan, but
that is vicarious--getting your jollies out of someone else's
achievements," says Ulrik, a retired electrical industry executive. "A
serious collector is doing something for humanity, preserving things that
cannot be replaced."</TE>
<TE>   Urlik's wife, Sandi, views his contribution to humanity somewhat
differently. "Originally, he wanted to play country and western music,"
she says, recalling the couple's early days on a military base in
Montana. "I don't want to discuss his singing and playing, but let's just
say the world is a better place with him playing classical guitar
instead."</TE>

<DH>James Turrell Is About to Unveil His Life's Work--a Natural Crater
Carved Into a  Celebration of Light and Space. Try Hanging That in a
Museum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WADE GRAHAM</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's sunset on a winter day at the Brentwood home of Mandy and
Cliff Einstein, the latter a trustee of the Museum of Contemporary Art.
Outside, on what had been the family's tennis court, sits a 20-foot white
cube that, from the exterior, seems an unlikely candidate for a work of
art. The interior is another matter.</LD>
<LD>   We enter through a doorway. The walls are white, lined with inclined
wooden benches. Above the benches, recessed yellowish tungsten lighting
is aimed up the walls at the ceiling, which has a 12-foot-square opening
that shows the sky. We sit and gaze up as the light blue sky slowly gives
way to darker blue. The square of color appears to be at once incredibly
deep and perfectly flat, as if it's painted on the ceiling like the sky
in Giotto's "Last Judgment" at Scrovegni Chapel in Padua: a perfect
illusion but for the little angels pulling at the edges of the backdrop.</LD>
<LD>   Through the doorway, the sky is completely different, with less color
and density. As we stare up inside, the deep blue gradually gives way to
an impossibly velveteen black, a transition so seamless that we're at a
loss to pinpoint the moment of change.</LD>
<TE>   The artist who designed the cube, James Turrell, likes to say that
night doesn't fall, it rises like a veil. The effect here is bizarre and
wonderful, not unlike watching the stars come out at Joshua Tree after
dropping acid--but without the saucer eyeballs and the three-day brain
burn. Here you come home, pour a glass of Chardonnay, spend 40 minutes in
the Turrell and still make your dinner reservation.</TE>
<TE>   It is the only large-scale Turrell work on permanent display in Los
Angeles, and the first to be viewed by the public in more than 10 years.
But the world is about to see more Turrells. A full-scale "lightwork"
opens March 16 in an installation commissioned by the cell-phone giant
Nokia at the Ace Gallery in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   More significantly, Turrell's monumental work in the high Arizona
desert, Roden Crater, will open to the public soon (although Turrell is
coy about the date, which has been postponed before). It is the product
of a quarter-century of labor to convert the immense volcanic cone into
an elaborate light and space installation. Could it be among the most
important artworks of the 21st century?</TE>
<TE>   If so, it will be a remarkable legacy for an artist who doesn't paint,
sculpt or make objects that are easily bought and sold. Most of his works
are too large to fit into a museum. Even the small ones can be seen only
with a lot of effort. His materials are light, empty space, silence and
darkness.</TE>
<TE>   Those have been his media since the late 1960s, when he surfaced as a
member of an obscure group of avant-garde artists living and working in
Venice and Ocean Park. In the decades since, as we entered the age of
celebrity artists and architects who design billion-dollar museums,
Turrell became a cattle rancher and something of a recluse, one of a
small group of American artists who continue to challenge the form and
function of museums and their basic claim to contain the full range of
contemporary art.</TE>
<TE>   James Turrell has always stood out. Born in Pasadena on May 6, 1943,
the son of an aerospace engineer and technical instructor, he became an
Eagle Scout at 13 and Pasadena's "boy of the year" in 1960. He earned a
bachelor's degree at Pomona College in perceptual psychology and also
studied art and art history before attending graduate school at the
Claremont Colleges.</TE>
<TE>   He burst out of art school as a member of the groundbreaking Los
Angeles scene of the late '60s and early '70s. This group, drawn to
Venice and Ocean Park by the cheap rents, boho vibe and beach, included
diverse artists such as Richard Diebenkorn, Robert Irwin, Larry Bell,
Bruce Nauman, Peter Alexander, Billy Al Bengston and Ed Moses. Tagged
variously as Light &amp; Space or Finish Fetish, they pushed the bounds of
art beyond even the New York minimalists of the early '60s: Donald Judd,
Carl Andre and Sol LeWitt.</TE>
<TE>   The minimalists' purpose had been to rescue art from the
illusionistic, emotional, tragic hero postures of the Abstract
Expressionists of the postwar period and to refocus modernism's gaze on
basic questions of form. Instead of making paintings that depicted some
thing or feeling, they made objects that "meant" nothing beyond their
literality--real things in real places in real time. "What you see is
what you see," said the artist Frank Stella. Hip galleries were filled
with blank cubes, square white paintings and bare fluorescent bulbs
propped against the walls.</TE>
<TE>   In New York City, the work was about a physical paring away,
accompanied with a flourish of rhetorical pronouncements from reviewers
and the artists themselves. But in Los Angeles, minimalism was a
comparatively quiet movement. It was more sensual than New York
minimalism, full of rich surfaces made with industrial materials such as
resins, plastics and glass, and influenced by the culture of customized
cars and surfboards.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the L.A. artists worked on both. Turrell for some time made a
living restoring vintage cars and airplanes. The concern for precision,
craft and finish was general. John McCracken, a prominent West Coast
minimalist with whom Turrell studied, finished slabs of wood with layer
upon layer of hand-rubbed lacquer until the colors seemed infinitely
deep. He then leaned them nonchalantly against gallery walls.</TE>
<TE>   The artist Peter Alexander, known then for his resin sculptures, calls
the L.A. style sensualism. "Everything was really beautiful and you
believed it, and you wanted it to be and the observers wanted it to be
like that, and everybody felt like that," he says. "Because it was the
'60s, there was enormous optimism and naivete, which was a good combo.
There was a lot of smiling."</TE>
<TE>   And then there was light. Bell, Irwin, Nauman, Maria Nordman, Eric Orr
and Doug Wheeler produced work concerned with the effects of light on
different materials. Turrell went even further, bypassing painting,
sculpture and objects of any kind in making light itself his medium and
human perception his subject. In his first one-man show in 1967 at the
Pasadena Art Museum, he used a slide projector fitted with a special lamp
to create the illusion of a cube of white light standing out from the
walls. When the viewer moved, the cube dissolved.</TE>
<TE>   Turrell moved on to make small apertures in rooms and buildings to
bring un- seen light sources into the space of the viewer, creating
beautiful, sometimes disorienting, effects.</TE>
<TE>   Turrell had come on the scene at the perfect moment, according to
Michael Govan, director of the Dia Art Foundation in New York, a private
contemporary arts foundation that began helping Turrell fund his projects
in the 1970s. "Minimalism, in its generic sense, was artists bringing art
to nothing," Govan says. "Jim Turrell could start by that nothing. His
career begins there. Once you throw out the frame and the pedestal and
start looking at things like light, purely, that's a starting point for a
whole new world."</TE>
<TE>   Turrell drew on everything in his background: experimental methods of
perceptual psychology from college, minimalism from McCracken, and his
own experiences as a pilot, where he immersed himself in the light of the
sky. Once, watching slides in an art history class, he fixated on the
light beam hanging in the darkness: "The light itself seemed somehow
preferable to the pictures," he has said.</TE>
<TE>   In November 1966, Turrell leased a building, the Mendota Hotel, on the
corner of Hill and Main streets in the Ocean Park neighborhood of Santa
Monica. Back then it was a "poor white beach," Turrell recalls, a place
struggling artists could afford to live. "There aren't really too many
left. I suppose there might be some down in Florida where the old men go
and fish the pilings, or like Jimmy Buffett used to talk about."</TE>
<TE>   For two years, Turrell sealed up the rooms, painted out windows,
closed off the outside. Then he carefully began opening it up. In a body
of work called the "Mendota Stoppages" he experimented with cutting holes
of different sizes in the walls, allowing light from outside--like the
passing of the sun or the passing of a bus at night--to come inside,
filling the space in extraordinary ways.</TE>
<TE>   He was learning about light and the unreliability of human perception,
how we "make the world through our senses." He tweaked the dimensions of
rooms and the color frequencies of lights to make light "materialize"--to
"apprehend" it. Some of the spaces at the Mendota were called "sensing
spaces," where the artwork essentially was a performance by the viewer.</TE>
<TE>   What did Los Angeles have to do with this? Was it the beach light,
soft and white, as the painter Richard Diebenkorn remarked, that inspired
such art? Turrell  downplays this common explanation. "Yes, there's light
there, but if that were true, there would have been many artists out of
the south of France."</TE>
<TE>   It would be the equivalent, he argues, of attributing the English
fondness for  watercolor to the ample rainfall there. Instead he links
the creativity in Los  Angeles to "a greater anarchy of taste, [leading
to] greater possibilities, because taste is restriction."</TE>
<TE>   But if you had been looking for the ultimate substance with which to
make art, it wouldn't have hurt that the sun was almost always shining
and that, in a movie town, watching the play of light on a wall in a
darkened room as a form of entertainment isn't out of the ordinary.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that Los Angeles plays a huge role," Govan says. "Bob Irwin
was turning the world upside down. James Turrell, Maria Nordman, Doug
Wheeler, if you take just those four artists, it goes head to head with
what was happening in New York, and it's never really been fully
appreciated." That said, Turrell's reputation has risen steadily. Art
dealers and most critics attest to his significance, although he remains
obscure to most museum-goers.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Schimmel, chief curator of L.A.'s Museum of Contemporary Art,
says Turrell's greatest contribution to the world of art has been in
changing the relationship of viewers with art, making them into
participants rather than observers. Since Turrell, an entire generation
of artists has turned to large-scale video, film and sculptural room
installations. "It's de rigueur," Schimmel says. "All of these come out
of this legacy of how he approached art-making as an environment and an
experience."</TE>
<TE>   His work also reflects the '60s in L.A.: the pushing against the doors
of perception, the faith in the possibility of liberation through a deep
experience of the world. Turrell's inquiries mirror Timothy Leary's,
without the drugs. His work requires, even forces, attention. The art is
in going through the ritual of waiting for perception. In one variant of
the "Mendota Stoppages," a prospective collector was instructed to sit in
a room for several hours. In the "Dark Spaces" series, the "percipient"
must wait in a dark room for 15 or 20 minutes before beginning to see
anything at all, and even then is uncertain if what he or she is
experiencing is optical illusion, stray photons, retinal imprints or
artistically induced insanity.</TE>
<TE>   Those interests in the boundaries of human perception were shared by
the booming aerospace industry of the late '60s and early '70s. From 1967
to 1971, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, in partnership with NASA,
set up an "Art and Technology" program. It consisted of collaborations
between artists and engineers in local firms, giving artists the use of
lasers, holograms and other fancy equipment. Irwin and Turrell teamed up
with a scientist at Garrett Aerospace to design an anechoic chamber, a
sensory deprivation enclosure without sound or light, where the "viewer"
was then exposed to various stimuli to see what would happen. It was
essentially experimentation on human subjects.</TE>
<TE>   The anechoic chamber led to Turrell's next innovation making Ganzfelds
("total fields" in German), spaces where all visual and aural clues to
dimension are lost in an undifferentiated light like a white-out blizzard
or dense fog--except that Turrell's light came in pretty colors. Turrell
compares the Ganzfelds to the floating and otherworldliness experienced
when diving or dreaming. "This otherworldliness can exist here
coincidental in our conscious, awake state too," he says. "I'm interested
in how we dream as well because there we create the world entirely. It's
totally visual. Here, with eyes closed, is full vision, clarity is great
or better than when the eyes are open, certainly with a lucid dream, with
colors perhaps even richer, and it's suffused with a light. It's
something we know about, but it's rarely seen with the eyes open."</TE>
<TE>   Another sensation and '60s reference he invokes is that of listening
to music and feeling as if the room has become larger than it is, "sort
of like the old Volkswagen ads, where it's bigger on the inside than it
is on the outside. There's truth to this in the sense that reality is not
just what we like to think of as 'the real world.' "</TE>
<TE>   turrell lost his lease on the mendota hotel in 1974, but by then he
had larger spatial ambitions. He had been helping support himself by
flying mail around the West under contract with the Postal Service, and
his skill as a pilot enabled him to search for a spot, such as a butte or
mesa above a surrounding flat landscape, where he could practice his art
on a grander scale. A Guggenheim grant paid for the gas while he searched
for seven months, crisscrossing the West from Canada to Mexico, the
Pacific to the Rockies. Again he was right in the avant-garde moment. A
few other artists had already gone out to the landscape, making something
nebulously called Land Art: Michael Heizer's Double Negative, beginning
in 1969, a pair of gouges in a Nevada canyon wall as long as the Empire
State Building laid on end; Robert Smithson's Spiral Jetty in Utah, in
1970; Walter De Maria's Lightning Field in New Mexico, in 1977; Judd's
concrete works in Marfa, Texas, beginning in 1979; even Christo's wrapped
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Turrell's flying had opened up new conceptual vistas. He was
interested in re-creating certain effects that occur at different
altitudes: celestial vaulting, where the sky appears rounded, curving
like a perfect dome to the horizon, and the "dollhouse" effect, "where
people become ants and then houses become models," Turrell says. To
preserve those effects, he needed a site remote from city light
pollution, with flat, open horizons not cluttered by buildings and a
clear, not too cloudy, blue sky.</TE>
<TE>   He found his grail 42 miles northeast of Flagstaff, Ariz., at the edge
of the San Francisco Peaks volcanic field at an elevation of 5,000 feet.
It was a 600-foot-high red cinder cone called Roden Crater, overlooking
the haunting expanses of the Painted Desert, adjacent to the Navajo and
Hopi reservations.</TE>
<TE>   Here he planned his most ambitious project, a kind of symphonic
assemblage of his discoveries from the Mendota Hotel and since:
skyspaces, light corridors, sensing spaces, all connected by a series of
tunnels. Each space would be built to frame and capture events in the day
or night sky, some occurring every day, some biannually and one, an
alignment of the moon, every 18.61 years. The light sources would be the
sun, moon and lightning, with the moon or sun lined up with apertures to
cast images through tunnels and onto stone slabs or pools of water, even
the polar star. Turrell would reshape the crater so celestial vaulting
would be exaggerated to the point of doubting one's eyeglass
prescription. The work would be a sort of giant machine for contemplating
nature's grandeur.</TE>
<TE>   Turrell recalls how, in his childhood house, his father had built a
glassed-in room covered by blackout curtains from World War II. Young
James, 6 or 7, would poke tiny holes in the curtains in the pattern of
the constellations so that he could "see" the stars in daylight. At Roden
Crater, he is revisiting this game on a huge scale.</TE>
<TE>   There is considerable humility in the gesture--as a form of devotion
to the overwhelming beauty of this world and vast hubris in the
expectation of getting someone to pay for it. Fortunately, Turrell is a
compelling salesman. He got his first Dia Center grant in 1975, which
helped him acquire the crater in 1977. In 1979 he moved to Flagstaff full
time.</TE>
<TE>   His funding from Dia soon collapsed, due to a falling stock market and
financial difficulties, so Turrell hit the road to raise money, mounting
exhibitions in Europe, Japan and the United States. The Italian collector
Guiseppe Panza di Biumo gave him a grant to do a set of schematic plans
for the crater. He also shared a 1984 MacArthur "genius" grant with
Irwin, the first such award for visual artists. In the '90s Dia came back
into the picture, along with the Lannan Foundation, but still Turrell
kept running out of money as the scale of his vision increased.</TE>
<TE>   He is quick to joke about it. "This piece became more involved, which
is a lesson that if you don't get support to artists soon enough, their
projects become even more grandiose than when they began. I've moved 1.2
million cubic yards of dirt. I didn't actually understand how I could
shape sky with it until I'd moved about 220,000 cubic yards, and it's
about a dollar and a quarter to move a yard of earth no matter where you
put it." The delays and costs mounted. He had matchbooks printed up
saying, "Sooner or Later Roden Crater."</TE>
<TE>   He is aware of the parallels to other giant lifework projects, some of
which were never finished. He ticks off San Simeon, the Watts Towers,
Mount Rushmore and, also in Arizona, Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin West,
Paolo Soleri's Arcosanti and the Biosphere 2 Center. He recalls going to
see the artist Jean Tinguely's giant sculpted head in France and asking
himself, "What was he thinking?" He admits that others might ask the same
about his crater.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998 the Lannan Foundation decided to go all the way, providing
most of the money, $9.5 million to date of a total that could reach as
high as $20 million if every element the artist envisions is built. In
collaboration with Lannan, the Dia Art Foundation will take on the
management.</TE>
<TE>   Dia's Michael Govan defends the cost: "We've had paintings from the
'50s that regularly sell at auction for a lot more than that. For
example, a Jasper Johns, $17-some million [the painting "False Start"
sold at auction in 1988 for $17,050,000]. I think Johns is a fantastic
artist, but people are spending sums for artists of roughly the same
generation for a 4-square-foot canvas. And I don't think Jim thinks of
his work any differently, he's just making an artwork. It just happens
that the terms are completely different."</TE>
<TE>   As you approach the crater from the southwest, bumping along 11 miles
of dirt road, you see cattle lolling among the rabbit brush. These are
"Jim's girls," 1,000 head. Arizona is still an open range state, where
the law requires that you fence your neighbors' cows out. The only way to
protect the crater's "viewshed" was for Turrell to become a rancher,
gaining control of 156 square miles, either owned outright or through
grazing leases.</TE>
<TE>   Visiting the crater is a trip in every sense. Phase one, begun in
January 1999, is nearly complete. As one walks up from the flank into the
center of the volcano through the 854-foot Alpha Tunnel, footsteps and
voices boom and return like cracks of thunder. A disc of bright light
marks the tunnel's upper opening, the East Portal, a room with a hole in
the ceiling to reveal the sky. From there you continue in the tunnel down
under the crater to Crater's Eye--a huge kiva-like opening that frames a
circular slice of blue air. A curving staircase leads from that spot to
the surface at the center of the crater, emerging into an elliptical,
sloping theater of red cinder. A ring of benches directs your attention
toward the rim, which seems to attach itself to the distinctly domed
sky--bright red, bright blue, with white haze at the edge. Four inclined
slabs interrupt the benches. Lying down on one, with your head lower than
your feet, looking up the slope into the blue, the sense of celestial
vaulting is radical, alarming, a little dizzying, like stepping into a
fisheye lens. Behind you the East Portal yawns, a clean, elliptical
concrete hole in the red earth.</TE>
<TE>   The scrupulous order is incongruous in the desert wilderness. It feels
like being alone on another planet amid the ruins of an alien
civilization. The quiet on this still January day is so huge that it
begins to howl and vibrate in the city dweller's mind.</TE>
<TE>   Schimmel offers another description: "It's about the ultimate sort of
controlled fantasy, creating a place on earth--that's the only way to
describe it because it will actually be visible from outer space. The
aliens will know that it's been built.</TE>
<TE>   "If his desire initially was to control the perceptions of individuals
when they enter this space, now it's much more encompassing, not a
30-minute thrill ride, a much more extended experience." This is just a
fraction of the planned spaces that have been built, and to experience
them all, with all of the intimate little discoveries in between, would
take some time, at least a day.</TE>
<TE>   With size comes logistical difficulties, not just for Turrell but for
many artists and sculptors who, decades ago, moved off of and outside the
gallery walls. They collectively voice the complaint that the art
establishment has swept them aside, throwing hundreds of millions or
billions of dollars not into art but into building new museums that are
no more than elaborate eye-catching wrappers concealing galleries that
are often too small and inflexible for anything but traditional exhibits.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this triple-A club that artists talk about--architects
against art," Turrell says. "This all started with Frank Lloyd Wright and
the Guggenheim, and the Guggenheim has, of course, continued in Bilbao.
This is a terrific, amazing building; what it has done for art I'm not
sure is good. If you were to build a building for General Motors or a
skyscraper for some company, and wouldn't allow them to make next year's
product, they wouldn't put up with it, not for a moment." Galleries in
many museums are often too small for anything but paintings or small
sculptures. Floors are not designed to bear heavy loads or be nailed
into. Walls and ceilings can't be moved. "They lock art into something
that doesn't necessarily contain art. When you make a container for art,
at least you ought to see what art is happening then," Turrell says.</TE>
<TE>   "When you deconstruct an architect's space, since now we've moved into
a period where the modern cathedral is actually the art museum, the
architects are alive so they get quite insulted by your cutting into
their space. It's getting so we can't do anything in these hallowed
places that the architects have made. It's their show and we have to go
somewhere else. So I do that."</TE>
<TE>   During construction of the $1-billion Getty Museum in Los Angeles,
architect Richard Meier nixed plans for a Turrell work on the main plaza,
even though the artist had been paid for it. Irwin's troubles with Meier
over the artist's bizarre garden at the site are now legendary. The Los
Angeles County Museum of Art's plans for a $300-million Rem
Koolhaas-designed museum to replace its current buildings will be one
more such "cathedral" in Los Angeles, in Turrell's view.</TE>
<TE>   Schimmel acknowledges this: "A lot of the most radical questions being
asked in the late '60s about museums being irrelevant are as unresolved
today as they were 30 years ago." Nonetheless, he says, work like
Turrell's isn't easy. Even within the Museum of Contemporary Art's Geffen
Contemporary,  which is set up "to work with this kind of experience,
it's still a bear. The challenge is twofold: one, to get it right, and
two, how much real estate it occupies. It takes money and it takes
space."</TE>
<TE>   At the core of the appeal of modern architecture is the promise that
it can create spaces of personal and collective transformation. At least
in the personal dimension, this is what Turrell does. It also is
accessible as a type of art that can be experienced without requiring the
viewer to have an education in art theory. A friend of mine, Agustin
Garza, a designer in Pasadena, tells a story about going with his in-laws
to the Temporary Contemporary/MOCA show, "Individuals," which opened in
December 1986. They were "unsophisticated about modern art," he says, the
kind of regular people who "think most of contemporary art is a hoax.
They thought Picasso was a scam."</TE>
<TE>   In the show they saw a Chris Burden piece called "Exposing the
Foundation of the Museum," in which the artist had dug a long trench
along the wall, literally exposing the building's concrete foundation,
with the excavated soil piled up on the floor. "They thought it was bull.
When they saw the title, they thought that confirmed that it was bull.
Then they looked at--or experienced--the Turrell installation that was
there, a skyspace. At first they weren't really quite sure how to think
of it as art, which opened up a whole discussion about art. They were
both entertained and taken by the sublime effect of the light and the
space. After that, they were able to go back to the Burden piece and
experience it and think about it in a different light. They got down into
the hole and smelled the soil and humidity and began to understand what
he was trying to communicate," says Garza.</TE>
<TE>   "So I consider Turrell a really important artist, and I just wish that
the general public would be more exposed to his work, because I think,
ironically, it would make it easier then to understand what Picasso
meant."</TE>
<TE>   One response has been the commitment of Dia and Lannan to fund and
manage over time a group of landscape-scale works, including Roden
Crater, The Lightning Field, the City projects, Spiral Jetty and Judd's
works in Marfa--collectively referred to as "the Western Projects." Govan
describes the venture as building a museum without walls. "The truth is,
it's taken time for some of that work to mature, it's taken time for
everybody to get over the conceptual radicalness of minimalism and now
see what these artists were doing was as maximal as anything. If you ask
me, these objects are as important as anything since Mondrian or
Picasso." To complete and preserve them for generations of people "means
taking the institution to them."</TE>
<TE>   Today the Mendota Hotel houses a Starbucks. Ocean Park, the poor white
beach, is posh real estate. Turrell has his $20 million lined up, if all
goes according to plan. A major international corporation, Nokia, has
been attracted to his luminance. All of these are signs, on the one hand,
of the triumph of the entire cultural project of Los Angeles in the
'60s--liberation while smiling. On the other, success threatens to
devolve into just money, art's revolutionary power into just the
entertainment and feeding of the private self. "Therapeutic ceremonials,"
as one critic has put it. Sort of like yoga. Inside a Turrell space,
there is the potential for transformation, but equally there is the
absence of history, of politics, of other people. The answer to the
challenge lies in going in and experiencing it oneself, in the flesh.</TE>

<HD>Geng Ping's Excellent Adventure</HD>
<DH>It Started as a Cultural Exchange Program--Chinese Chefs Immersing
Themselves in All Things American. For One Woman, It Ended in a
Metamorphosis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Evelyn Iritani</AU>
<BD>Evelyn Iritani is a Times staff writer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Geng Ping was having a Hollywood moment. Everyone in China, at
least everyone she knew, had heard of "The Godfather," the classic
Hollywood tale of the American dream gone sour. And now this daughter of
a Beijing policeman was standing on a hill overlooking Francis Ford
Coppola's Napa Valley home, sampling a bottle of Niebaum-Coppola wine
that cost more than most Chinese earn in a day.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, she didn't really like wine, but that's another story.</LD>
<LD>   For an ambitious young chef from a working-class Beijing neighborhood,
it was a food fantasy beyond her wildest dreams: a tour of famous Napa
Valley wineries, lessons from some of America's finest chefs, dinners at
bistros featured in Gourmet magazine and, now, her own brush with fame.</LD>
<TE>   Some might call it fate. Others would chalk it up to cosmic forces.
But Geng had no patience for whys. In the here and now, two different
forces were converging: the aspirations of American agricultural
interests angling for a bigger share of the China market, and the best
intentions of idealistic chefs eager to move an image of American cuisine
beyond fast food. Like Alice tumbling down the rabbit hole, this
28-year-old found herself on a culinary adventure that would alter her
life--though not in the way her benefactors intended.</TE>
<TE>   Geng Ping was born in 1973, at the tail end of communism's darkest
years. by the time she was in elementary school, the Cultural Revolution
was history and China's leaders were tentatively opening their doors to
the once-taboo forces of capitalism. While the land of Mao suits and
communes gave way to Gucci boutiques and McDonald's golden arches, Geng
pursued the simple pleasures of childhood: playing with her elder sister
in their West Beijing neighborhood, swimming at the local pool. She was
16 on June 4, 1989, when Tiananmen Square became a bloody battleground in
the struggle between pro-democracy supporters and the government, an
event that sent U.S.-China relations into the deep freeze. Asked about
that time, Geng grows quiet, then politely asks to change the subject. At
first glance, Geng and her friends don't appear that different from young
people in Tokyo or New York. They watch Hollywood blockbusters on DVDs,
hang out at neon-filled shopping malls and sip Starbucks coffee. But in
some areas of life, particularly politics, the government still casts a
forbidding shadow. The message is clear: Respect tradition and tread
incautiously at your own risk.</TE>
<TE>   Geng, for example, had discovered that her options as the second
daughter of a working-class couple were limited. She loved Chinese
classical literature and poetry and fantasized about becoming a teacher.
But middle school graduation was followed by a fork in the path: She
could either attend high school, which would allow her to go on to
college if she passed the competitive exams, or vocational school. Her
parents urged her to embrace the practical. Why not police work?</TE>
<TE>   Leafing through a book of vocational programs, Geng came across
culinary training for the hotel industry. The opportunity to work in a
place populated with foreigners sounded intriguing, although kitchens
made the slender young woman uneasy. ("Women cooks in China are usually
fat," she observed.) She settled on a program that trains chefs for the
"cold kitchen," where she could surround herself with fruits and
vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   After graduation, Geng, who goes by Cindy (she got the name from the
movie "Cinderella"), landed jobs at several Beijing hotels and spent 10
months on a cruise ship in northern Europe. In 1997, she joined the Hong
Kong-based Shangri-La chain, which was building a 562-room hotel in
Dalian, a bustling Chinese port across the water from North Korea. There
she coordinated the produce orders and oversaw the preparation of the
hotel's salad buffet, fruit baskets and other cold foods. Competition was
fierce for foreign business travelers and Japanese tour groups, making
cost-cutting a top priority.</TE>
<TE>   Dalian offered few diversions for a young single woman. Indeed, other
staff grew tired of the remote location and returned to Beijing. But Geng
persevered, becoming the highest-ranking woman in the kitchen. Her salary
rose to 7,000 yuan ($846) a month, nearly 10 times the national average,
and she was assigned a private room in the staff apartment building.</TE>
<TE>   But the pressure and dawn-to-dusk workdays exacted a price,
transforming her into a more solemn, quieter person. On her one day off,
Geng had little energy to do anything but sleep or read. Or eat.
Occasionally she and her friends would splurge on the only American food
they knew: McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut. At least she
could savor the pleasures of junk food.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, 5,700 miles and cultural light years away, a small
group of American chefs were conspiring to transform China's image of
American cuisine. For those swept up in their good intentions and noble
ambitions, life would never be the same.</TE>
<TE>   Is it possible to change the taste buds of a nation with a food
culture dating back 5,000 years? Three years ago, the Culinary Institute
of America and the Western U.S. Agricultural Trade Assn., a trade
promotion group, decided to find out. The mission of the CIA--the cooking
school, not the spook agency--was to present a more sophisticated image
of American food to China. Think fresh, seasonal and ethnic. Think roast
turkey with spicy peanut mole or Thai spicy braised beef with star anise
and lemon grass. The trade organization wanted to sell more U.S.
agriculture goods, a rather audacious idea in a country whose global
palate is still in its infancy. (The most popular Western food in China
is KFC, which opens a restaurant in that country every three days.) How
to achieve both goals? Target influential chefs in the Western kitchens
of China's five-star hotels.</TE>
<TE>   Backed by a $900,000, three-year grant from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, the CIA launched the China Foodservice Education Initiative
in the spring of 2000, arriving at Dalian's Shangri-La Hotel just as the
long, cold winter set in.</TE>
<TE>   As the most proficient English speaker in the hotel kitchen, it was
Geng's responsibility to keep the classroom stocked and bridge the gaps
between the foreign chefs and the nervous Chinese staff and students. The
early encounters were painful. "When we got there, they were absolutely
stone-faced," says CIA instructor Adam Busby. "I think they were fearful
we were going to come in there and make their lives hell for two weeks,"
the 38-year-old Toronto native recalls. "By the third day, they were
laughing. By the fourth day, we were all friends."</TE>
<TE>   Busby was also intimidated. "The Chinese knew how to cook before
anybody else in the world knew how to cook," says the chef, who had
previously owned Star Anise, a popular Vancouver, B.C. restaurant. "Their
whole philosophy of eating, their loyalty and allegiance to their flavors
is amazing. We don't have that because we're such a young country."</TE>
<TE>   But he soon learned that his enthusiastic Chinese students, largely
trained in classic European-style cooking, were unfamiliar with many
culinary influences Americans take for granted, even flavors from nearby
Vietnam, Thailand or India. Geng had been exposed to international
cuisine on the cruise ship, but the CIA menus included ingredients she
had never heard of, such as peanut flour and orange flower water.</TE>
<TE>   Geng, the de facto culinary and cultural translator, felt as if an
exotic species had invaded her kitchen, a group of wisecracking cowboys
in white hats. They poked fun at each other, substituted ingredients with
abandon and insisted on venturing out into the frigid air every evening
to seek new food adventures.</TE>
<TE>   Their culinary knowledge was impressive, from the curries of India to
the moles of Mexico. But linguistic dysfunction lurked around every
corner. In the translation of the CIA's teaching manual, some finer
points were lost. Busby didn't realize how much until he turned around
one day and observed one of his students poised to drop a whole turkey
into a vat of boiling vegetable broth. "My recipe said roasted turkey,
but the Chinese version said poached," he says.</TE>
<TE>   To stave off disaster, Geng and Busby began reviewing the recipes
before class. Several days into their meetings, Geng began to let down
her guard. She confided that she dreamed of becoming a hotel food and
beverage manager but feared it was impossible because of the
discrimination women chefs faced in China.</TE>
<TE>   Before he left Dalian, Busby told Geng that he hoped to see her again.
Not likely, given the cost of a trip to the United States, she replied
sadly. "She had this real lust for wanting to get more out of life but
this overwhelming feeling of repression. I felt bad that she felt her
opportunities were so limited," says Busby, who chased his culinary
passion to France, South Africa and western Canada before settling at the
CIA.</TE>
<TE>   On their last day in China, the CIA chefs dropped by the kitchen to
give the Shangri-La staff some CIA aprons, T-shirts and instant-read
thermometers. Busby and Geng shared a warm handshake, but there was a
wistful quality  to the obligatory farewells. "Everybody kind of knew we
wouldn't 'See you later,"' says Busby.</TE>
<TE>   It was a warm May afternoon when Geng Ping disembarked at the  San
Francisco airport. Her suitcase contained some clothes, a chef's coat and
hat, a set of knives and a bottle of appetite suppressants. She had come
prepared for a parallel universe of abundance and affluence, though she
soon learned that life in America was far more complex--inside and
outside the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Adam Busby had left Geng inspecting produce in her
Dalian kitchen, the CIA was asked to set up a tour under the U.S.-funded
Cochran Fellowship. The 10-day visit was designed to expose young Chinese
chefs to the creation and consumption of food in America, from the ground
up. The CIA put Geng on the guest list, and Jess Corder, the Shangri-La's
Australian food and beverage manager, urged the hotel to let her go.
"She's talented," he says. "She needs to be pushed to take risks."</TE>
<TE>   The Shangri-La didn't take any chances. Geng was told she must repay
all travel costs related to her visit to America if she left the hotel
within three years. She wasn't deterred. Next stop, the CIA's West Coast
branch, located at Greystone, a historic winery in the heart of Napa
Valley, home to gourmet restaurants, specialty farms and hundreds of
wineries. Within just a few miles of Greystone, Geng was able to sample
French bistro cooking, Italian pasta and pizza, visit a Dean &amp; DeLuca
specialty food store and tour farms producing organic vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   On the first day of class, Geng showed up at the CIA's high-ceilinged
kitchen--a maze of $250,000 French stoves and hot tub-sized
stockpots--dressed in her neatly pressed jacket and white chef's hat. The
stainless steel counters were piled high with donations from the 32
corporate supporters of the program. There were boxes of U.S. top choice
beef steaks and pork ribs, gleaming Alaskan salmon, oysters that just
hours earlier were in the Pacific and bags of nuts. There were sweet
peas, fingerling potatoes and endive from nearby farms.</TE>
<TE>   American bistro-style cooking, with its emphasis on seasonality and
informality, was the focus of the lessons. Bill Briwa, a CIA instructor
and former chef at Thomas Keller's famed French Laundry restaurant in
nearby Yountville, secretly hoped to wean the Chinese chefs from their
European roots, which tended to be more formal and "sauce-centric." For
several days, he guided the seven chefs through a series of dishes: beef
tenderloin with glazed onions in balsamic vinegar, pan-roasted squab with
Cabernet cassis and roasted shallots, soft-shell crab and cauliflower
grenobloise.</TE>
<TE>   For Geng, the sole woman and the only chef not trained in the hot
kitchen, there was a lot to absorb. It helped that Briwa was a master of
the self-deprecating gibe, using humor to tell his students, "Relax,
nobody's perfect." While others joked in Mandarin or nodded off behind a
stockpot, Geng scribbled notes.</TE>
<TE>   After a couple days, Briwa unleashed the chefs in the kitchen with
instructions to create something for lunch. American bistro was history.
Out came the well-tested recipes that had won accolades back home. Geng
used a piece of top-grade American beef to produce a lemon grass-infused
salad. Her friend, Shang Yuan Xin, who worked in the Furama Hotel Dalian,
made a spicy Dalian-style soft-shell crab flavored with ginger and soy
sauce. The Alaskan salmon was thinly sliced and served sashimi-style.</TE>
<TE>   But in the midst of this gastronomic fantasy, Geng felt uneasy. Back
home, price almost always trumped quality. She served farmed Norwegian
salmon on her salad buffet because it cost 25% less than the American
variety, and most Chinese wouldn't know the difference. U.S. beef may be
more tender but its Australian competition is a lot easier to get in
China and 15% to  25% cheaper. Years of cost-cutting made it impossible
for Geng not to make these calculations.</TE>
<TE>   Money wasn't the only barrier. Many ingredients commonly found in the
CIA kitchen weren't very appealing to the Chinese. Briwa urged his
students to try a sliver of California Sareanah cheese with a slice of
quince jelly. Geng didn't want to offend her host, but just a waft of the
pungent cow's milk cheese made her nauseated. In fact, many Chinese are
lactose-intolerant, lacking the enzyme needed to properly digest milk
products. Back in her kitchen, Geng made her staff taste the dishes with
cheese. The same with olive oil. "Too rich," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Which raises a delicate issue. In their eagerness to exploit the
world's fastest-growing economy, many Americans believe that all they
need to do was get rid of those pesky tariffs and corrupt officials and
U.S. goods would flow into China. But aside from some brand-name luxury
goods, specialty products and high-tech machinery, it is not easy to find
goods bearing the "Made in USA" label. When Wal-Mart opened its second
store in Dalian last year, it entertained customers with Western-inspired
rap dancing, but 95% of the goods for sale were manufactured in China.</TE>
<TE>   What if the Chinese don't need or want what the U.S. has to offer?</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in modern China, Geng was accustomed to the contradictions
of a society with one foot in the new millennium and the other a century
behind. What she hadn't expected was to find a different set of paradoxes
play out in Gold Mountain, the fabled land of paved gold streets that had
been a magnet for poor Chinese for more than 100 years.</TE>
<TE>   The month before she had left for America, a Chinese fighter plane and
American spy plane had crashed over China's Hainan Island, triggering the
first diplomatic crisis of the newly installed Bush administration. The
Chinese press had depicted America as a hotbed of anti-Chinese sentiment,
with hostile voices calling for retaliation and a boycott of Chinese
goods. Much to her relief, Geng had discovered a country that was far
more hospitable than she had imagined.</TE>
<TE>   In her desk at the Shangri-La, Geng has kept some menus from her
gastronomic journey, whose highlights included homemade sausages served
with white sauce, potato puree and sauteed prunes at Thomas Keller's Napa
Valley bistro, Bouchon, and a sweet dessert soup topped with edible
flowers at Rick Bayless' famed Frontera Grill in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Her favorite? Well, she admits somewhat guiltily, it is the Cheesecake
Factory, the popular Detroit-based chain restaurant featuring more than
20 varieties of cheesecake. Of course Geng never tasted the namesake
dish, given her dairy aversion. What brought her back twice was the
friendliness of the staff. "In China, you're guest and servant," she
says. "In America, you're friend and friend."</TE>
<TE>   The mental snapshots that are Geng's most memorable souvenirs of
America extend far beyond the $10 glasses of wine and the boisterous
lessons in the CIA kitchen. They include the unexpected sight of homeless
people sleeping on the streets of San Francisco. Or young women
discarding their cigarette butts on the streets of Chicago, where the
chefs attended the National Restaurant Assn. trade show. "I thought in
America everybody cares about the environment very much," she says. On
the other hand, her chain-smoking companions were horrified to discover
that the country that fancied itself the global champion of individual
liberties treated smokers as if they were criminals.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone wants to go to America. They want to work there, want to
live there," she says. "They think life is very good in America. They
think money can come very easy. I don't think so. Why do people think
they can change their life by going outside, if they cannot change their
life here?"</TE>
<TE>   With winter approaching and the war on terrorism scaring off tourists,
business at the Dalian Shangri-La was unusually slow. But customers
arriving in November got a treat, a Tex-Mex promotion featuring Mexican
music and CIA-inspired barbecued chicken, grilled corn and beef tacos.
The advertising posters credited "Chef Cindy, trained in America." Geng
warned her boss that her shopping list included a few pricey American
products, such as pecans. "I told him if you want me to do this promotion
right, I cannot use cheap things or the guests won't like it."</TE>
<TE>   A few months earlier, Geng had endured a grueling 25-hour train ride
to take part in the CIA's final China cooking seminar, at Shanghai's
Pudong Shangri-La Hotel. It was a chance to rekindle old friendships;
Busby and his wife, Barbara Alexander, taught the class, and several of
the chefs from her America trip also took part. It had been just eight
months since their first meeting, but Busby was struck by Geng's more
assertive nature. Still the only woman in class, she didn't hesitate to
ask questions about a delicate smoked salmon rillette or offer advice to
a struggling classmate. "We saw a much more confident chef," Busby says.</TE>
<TE>   On the last day of class, Geng bid farewell to her teachers, smiling
when Busby said he hoped to see her again soon. On her way out the door,
she was pulled aside by Glen Ballis, an Australian who had recently
joined the Shangri-La Pudong as executive chef. He had been impressed by
her cooking skills and her "ability not to be overwhelmed by the
male-dominant thing in the kitchen." Would she like a job? Another door
had opened.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the CIA packed up its trunk of spices the final time, more
than 1,600 Chinese food service professionals had passed through its
classes. Yang Ying Chen, who had accompanied Geng to America, is helping
plan a new California restaurant on the drawing board at the Kerry Centre
Hotel in Beijing. Chen Gang, a sous-chef at the Grand Hyatt Shanghai, has
added several of the CIA's dishes to his menu, including a salmon with a
creamy white bean veloute that one customer ordered three times in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Busby, who had sneaked into Chinese kitchens whenever he got a spare
moment during his visits, brought back some new wok skills and a deeper
appreciation for a culture that has perfected the art of creating more
from less. His favorite meal, the one that haunts his dreams, was an
early morning bowl of steaming hand-made noodles bought from a street
vendor in Shanghai. "They're remarkable in their ability to make
something magical out of very little," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The future of the CIA's innovative China Foodservice Education
Initiative is uncertain, since the U.S. Department of Agriculture
rejected the school's application for another round of funding. In this
age of fiscal responsibility, it is far easier to justify spending money
on changing people's buying habits than their attitudes. A spike in
Chinese purchases of Alaskan salmon or California almonds can be easily
documented. It's more difficult to measure the expansion of culinary
creativity in a luxury hotel in Shanghai or the effect of a young Chinese
woman's warm feelings toward America.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. devotes millions of dollars a year to promoting sales of U.S.
beef and wheat, but the nation's most influential export may be the
attitude that anything is possible, that mixing the flavors of the world
can produce a meal worthy of an emperor, that being born poor is not
always a ball and chain.</TE>
<TE>   Geng now understands that doors swing open--as well as shut--even in
China. Her move to Shanghai was quashed by the Chinese government, which
insisted that the Shangri-La fill that job with a local. But she has
gotten permission to go to Beijng this year to be trained in the hot
kitchen, which would take her a step closer to a hotel management job.</TE>
<TE>   In her apartment, she has several bottles of California wine that she
brought back from America, along with a wine dictionary and some
cookbooks. Before visiting the Napa Valley, the only imported wine she
had tried was too bitter for her taste. Then, she took a sip of
Kendall-Jackson Chardonnay and was smitten. "I am saving it for a special
occasion," she says with the confidence of someone who knows that day
will come.</TE>

<DH>How's the City Feeling These Days? A View From Life on the Edge.</DH>

<AU>ERIC PAPE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Terrorist cells, anthrax, recession, war; these are stressful
times," says the junk mail flier, suggesting that a workout will clear up
our clouded souls. A sidewalk billboard in the East Village for another
fitness club reads: "If this is a price war, we just dropped the bomb."
We grimace. Airplanes roar ominously overhead. The shadow of a flock of
birds draws our glances into the sky. Wailing police sirens screech with
memories. People stiffen at breaking news bulletins during televised
ballgames.</LD>
<LD>   I know an artist who creates powerfully pained feminine images, often
in pink. She had been listless in her vast black-and-white loft in
Tribeca, unable to paint, so I suggested that she leave her hometown for
a few days. "Rejuvenate," I told her.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing doing. "Something might happen," she warned. "Terrorists might
blow up the city with a nuclear bomb in a suitcase." As a single woman
with no kids and, as far as I know, no pets, why then wouldn't she get
far away from the city before it is vaporized. "I don't want to be far
from my paintings." I asked her to consider the difficulties of making
such a bomb and sneaking it into the United States--the cost, the risk,
the unavailability of the technology. Are there confirmed reports that
such bombs actually exist? I ask. "Well, who would have thought that
those towers could be knocked down," came her reply. "You don't know what
can happen now. Anything can happen."</LD>
<TE>   My friend Mark, the only bond trader I know, says he understands. "The
whole city has been bitten by Worst Case Scenario," he says. "It is a new
cultural phenomenon in which people's normal risk-analysis has been
thrown out the window. They don't assess things." Mark says his wife is a
victim of this new condition (and cautions that if I mention his last
name he will have problems at home). "She hasn't ridden the subway. There
might be anthrax down there," he says. But even the subway is a secondary
concern, for the couple live in the shadow of the Empire State Building,
which survived the crash of an airplane in 1945. To comfort his wife,
Mark dug up a photograph showing the American B-25 bomber that lost its
way in the fog and struck the building. It proved, he said, that "this
building is tough."</TE>
<TE>   For now, they are continuing to renovate their apartment, believing
that "we will always keep this place." Unless, of course, a catastrophe
strikes midtown. "Then it would be a lot harder to keep it."</TE>
<TE>   Other things are already hard to keep, like jobs. The man who is
supposed to get the city over the financial hump, its new mayor, spent
$69 million for a job for which he'll receive a yearly salary of $1. The
dumpy economy, so widely blamed on the "Bin Laden effect," was becoming a
reality a year ago. The roaring '90s were over. The extravagant Internet
launch parties were scaled down and then disappeared. Friends and
acquaintances caught leaping between jobs fell into an abyss of
unemployment and now have bank accounts that scratch at zero.</TE>
<TE>   Struggling bar owners keep extending happy hours, which now last four
to six hours. A sidewalk chalkboard trying to bring in patrons asks:
"Drunk yet?" A local bartender at one of the trendy newish spots in the
East Village says he's engaging in the old pro's trick of serving stiffer
drinks to make up in tips for the decline in customers. In recent months,
the economic decline simply sped up, and this has stemmed the flow of
people to New York. Gentrification is slowing. Even outrageous rents have
become slightly less outrageous. A French friend who took a job in a
Brooklyn real estate office after being laid off from several waitressing
jobs says that rental and sales staff leap for ringing telephones in
hopes of getting a shrunken commission.</TE>
<TE>   My friend Nathan Thoma was in escrow to buy a house in a hardscrabble
Brooklyn neighborhood in  September. After some serious reconsideration,
he went through with the deal. Then he purchased homeowner's insurance.
Looking through the forms, he says, he discovered that the house is not
covered for damage due to revolution or insurrection. "I wouldn't
normally have given it a second thought," he says with a nervous laugh.
But then he found out that the house is covered if consumed by a nuclear
fireball, which led him to  the question: "What if there was a nuclear
fireball as part of an insurrection?" The city feels emptier, its bright
lights dimmed. Friends have stopped going out. One couple jumped into
their car on Sept. 11, drove back to Virginia and sent for their stuff.
Other friends have disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone says New Yorkers are tough. They are. But is it because the
city transforms them, or because everyone else--maybe the more rational
ones--leave? Before 9-11, I had discovered a childhood friend from Los
Angeles, Jean Rousseau, living in an East Village apartment just a block
from mine. He's back in L.A. now. "Making the decision was easy for me,"
he wrote. While on vacation in Los Angeles, he learned he had been ousted
from the apartment he was informally subletting. Then Sept. 11 came. "I
was in L.A., enjoying the space, beach, barbecues, and it hit me. Broke,
without an apartment, and now my city getting attacked by terrorists.
What's a man to do? The path of least resistance was pointing west. My
mind said, 'You're moving to find a better quality of life.' My heart
said, 'You're moving to get close to the surf and your family and
friends.' My wallet said, 'You're moving . . . period.' "</TE>
<TE>   A visionary college buddy, Stephen Kosloff, has been living hand to
mouth amid increasing debts since being laid off from an investment bank
nearly two years ago. He is publishing Ghent, a magazine of letters, on a
"dental-floss budget," which, he says, is far less than a shoestring.
"There is now just an abundance of talented magazine people who need
work. It is really a hirer's market." He speaks liberally. He has "hired"
no one, having instead taken on dozens of recent college graduates who
under normal circumstances would command wages.</TE>
<TE>   Steve is strangely hopeful. Significant publications such as Time and
the New Yorker came to prominence during the Great Depression, so perhaps
his will thrive amid a recession, he explains. "It is pretty
encouraging." Then again, Steve can't afford Drano to clear his sink.</TE>
<TE>   While Talk magazine could afford Drano, it certainly didn't thrive. A
few weeks ago, I had scheduled a story proposal meeting with one of the
magazine's editors, and the next day Talk ceased publication. My meeting
remained scheduled, however, at least as far as I knew. Which raised a
recessionary etiquette quandary: Should I call to see if the meeting was
still on or simply show up as scheduled and offer freelancing tips? Would
my call or my arrival worsen the pain?</TE>
<TE>   Not wanting to show up at a closed building, I called. The editor's
assistant suggested I get back in touch after his boss got a new job. "If
he gets a new job," I joked. Nervous laughter.</TE>
<TE>   The situation is better for others. Lynn Altman is a partner in a
small, thriving product-branding company. "We're getting people we
wouldn't have gotten before," she says. But they are being selective.
Representatives of an Egyptian beverage company came, in late September,
in search of an image for their nonalcoholic malt beverage. "They said,
'We'll have to arrange for you to go to Egypt.'</TE>
<TE>   "We said, 'We can't go to Egypt. It is kind of hard to be an American
in the Middle East right now.'</TE>
<TE>   "They said, 'We are American, too, and it isn't hard.' But they are
Arab Americans. Normally I would love to go to Egypt, but it wasn't the
time. We felt so bad. They were so offended that we didn't want to go.
They said, 'We feel safer in Egypt than in New York.' They may be right."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, winter came, later than anyone could remember. Now cars are
capped with snow that descends out of a haze so oppressive that it is
impossible to see the Empire State Building or the candle-like Chrysler
building. The city has been reduced to a village, and it seems reasonable
to wonder whether the sky will ever clear up, whether the days will once
again grow long, and whether the bitterest cold, the one inside, will
thaw.</TE>
<TE>   As my friend the artist mused: You don't know what can happen now.</TE>

<LD>A front lawn might seem a quick solution to a problem: Bare ground
in front of house, roll out turf. The neighbors have some. The whole city
is green with it, broken only by driveways and busy roads. But is this
lawn carpet--rooted in the early 19th century American affection for
English landscape parks--pretty or practical? Are people having fun on
it?</LD>
<LD>   To the latter, I would venture to say rarely, with the possible
exception of backyards, and only if these people are under 12, or rich
enough to own a football field. But in front, the grass just lies there,
inert and empty, demanding water.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, imagine a colorful, aromatic yard--humming with
bees, hopping with birds, alive, enticing. The kind of spot you'd go out
of your way to pass, hoping the owner might be weeding so you could ask
the name of that fiery rose. Lawn alternatives might include small trees
and low hedges to block views of whizzing cars. Paths wander through it,
helping visitors decompress en route from street to front door, and
plants wreath the way in welcome. Along these lines, the owners of the
following gardens have found different ways to skip the lawn.</LD>
<TE>Beverly Hills</TE>
<TE>   While naturalistic sweeps and flowery meadows might be perfect for a
cottage, a grander place can require a stricter hand. But again, this
doesn't mean that one must plant--or keep--a lawn. Los Angeles landscape
designer Chris Rosmini, who conceived Karen and David Sachs Beverly Hills
garden, took her cues from their 1920s Italian-style house. "It's
beautiful, crisp, even a bit  severe," notes Rosmini, who found a vast
turf field and some leggy  bananas and birds of paradise in front when
she arrived. "I saw a chance to set the beauty off by surrounding it with
the order of a formal garden but keeping the lines soft," she says. "The
house would rise out of a froth of plants that you wouldn't perceive as
stiff or formal."</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of a lawn, she sketched a loose parterre, bounded along the
sidewalk by a mounded row of Pittosporum crassifolium 'Compactum' shrubs.
To the left of a wide paved entry walk, she edged two square planting
beds, separated by a gravel path, with rosemary hedges, and she filled
these compartments with spreading silver helichrysum, gaura and  Mexican
evening primrose. Then, instead of the formal urns and clipped shrubs you
might expect as focal points, she brought in plain concrete pots spouting
dwarf pampas grass. Some of the same plants reappear to the right of the
walk. There, in a tapestry of grays and greens, they swirl around
'Glacier' ivy at the feet of an olive tree. Close by but curtained off by
another hedge is the driveway, and alongside it, a functional scrap of
lawn. Its purpose? To sweeten the first step from car to terra firma.</TE>
<TE>Monrovia</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors still lounge on front porches in Monrovia, and Andree Matton
has surrounded hers with a field of catmint, yarrow, lavender and
succulents. In the spirit of the nearby foothills, Glendora landscape
architect Rick Fisher helped Matton replace a turf lawn edged with
daisies with plants appropriate to the hot, dry inland climate. Among
those on her wish list were a few California natives such as manzanita,
which Matton loves for its ruddy bark. But Fisher also found
"garden-friendly" substitutes for many chaparral plants.</TE>
<TE>   Aloes, for  instance, stand in for yuccas, which were too tall and
rangy for Matton's 50-by-40-foot front plot. Similarly, 'Goodwin Creek'
lavender keeps its compact shape and blooms longer than native sage or
artemisia.</TE>
<TE>   When Matton bought her 1925 California bungalow in the late '90s, iron
fencing set off the porch, and the lawn, rife with palm seedlings from
local street trees, sloped disconcertingly from right to left. Fisher
designed a wooden porch rail in keeping with the house but sturdy enough
in a pinch to serve as seating. Another garden seat tops the stone wall
Fisher added along the drive to retain extra soil needed to level the
lot.</TE>
<TE>   From either perch, Matton has a clear view of her "very public outdoor
room packed with show-offy colors and shapes. Everyone around here knows
this house," she says. "The orange gazanias all summer, the succulent
blooms in winter, the bees and hummingbirds. A grass lawn is always the
same. My garden is always changing." Still, Matton is no slave to her
garden's grace. She says, "Instead of mowing on weekends, I spend an hour
every few weeks clipping and tending. If I miss a couple of months, it
only grows a little wilder."</TE>
<TE>Atwater Village</TE>
<TE>   People driving by Brigitte Pavich Echols' Spanish bungalow in Atwater
Village must have clapped and cheered as nutmeg geraniums, sages and 'Pat
Austin' roses went into new beds on either side of her front path,
replacing dry grass that Echols, a commercial stylist, had allowed to
die. Instead of a space she hurried through as she entered or left her
house, she wanted an inviting setting where cooking herbs and cutting
flowers mixed and where a short hedge and well-placed trees would screen
out the worst of city life.</TE>
<TE>   Elysian Park garden designer Judy Kameon of Elysian Landscapes created
four small flower beds--separated by two intersecting earthen walks--and
packed them with orange and white roses, alstroemerias and Mediterranean,
California and culinary sages. Around these, in keeping with the
Mediterranean-style house, she tucked rosemary, lavender and convolvulus,
adding agaves and aloes for their spiky shapes. Oregano and thyme fill in
the gaps, magnolias flower near the street, and a hedge of 'Little Ollie'
dwarf olives has knit together along the sidewalk, setting limits for
local canines.</TE>
<TE>   What pleases Echols beyond the snappy scenery is its eco-friendliness:
The drought-tolerant plants are watered sparingly via drip irrigation and
fed with organic compost only. In place of polluting lawn-care tools such
as mowers and edgers, she uses hand pruners and cuts plants back herself,
a seasonal rather than weekly job. But her rewards are constant--blooms
to snip year-round, kitchen herbs, and a daily walk home through a
garden.</TE>
<TE>Silver Lake</TE>
<TE>   In Silver Lake, another Judy Kameon creation couldn't be more
different. The patch of ground, which sits directly on the street, needed
planting to mitigate the fortress-like feel of the house, designed in the
1930s by R.M. Schindler. Given a hot western exposure, the plants had to
be tough, and without the buffer of a sidewalk, they had to be sturdy
enough to withstand incursions by dogs. But not just dogs, Kameon says:
"Trash, thrown newspapers, car fumes. The frontyard is a brutal
environment. And since it's so exposed, it's less fun to garden in, yet
it has to look good year-round; it's the face you present to the world."</TE>
<TE>   Kameon designed a visually graphic and virtually no-maintenance
alternative for the owner. She chose a simple palette: 'Yellow Wave'
flax, prostrate juniper, yellow-toothed Aloe saponaria and 'Bush Dawn'
kangaroo paws, all in harmony with a lemon tree spilling over the front
wall from an entry court. Even this tiny spot features seasonal
fluctuations. The aloes flower in winter as the lemons begin to ripen.
The fruit hangs on through spring, when the furry kangaroo paws bloom and
carry the garden into summer. Fine-chipped gravel, used as groundcover,
not only reduced the number of plants the bed required, but it also cools
and insulates plant roots and adds polish to the composition.</TE>

<HD>Potato Pie</HD>
<DH>No Matter How You Stuff It, Schiacciata di Patate Is a Tradition
Worth Keeping</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA RANDALL</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Italian cooks played it straight when they named their foods.
Cannelloni, a large, round type of macaroni, translates to "big pipes."
Ricotta, skim milk that is subjected to repeated slow boiling, stands for
"recooked." Stracchino, a soft cheese from Milan, means "a little tired,"
in honor of the mountain cows from which it originated and their journey
to the big city.</LD>
<LD>   But perhaps the Italians were most sensible when it came to
schiacciata (skyah-CHAH-tah), a generic term used for a variety of dishes
made with dough or olive oil. It simply means "crushed."</LD>
<LD>   Tuscan-born chef Anna Bini serves a stuffed variation of schiacciata
in her Parisian restaurants, consisting of focaccia halved and spread
with a creamy fresh cheese, then filled with sauteed zucchini, onions and
fresh mint. Closer to home at Ca'del Sole in North Hollywood, chef Soerke
Peters offers schiacciata di pollo, a grilled boneless chicken laced with
lemon zest and served in an iron skillet with green beans and crisply
fried potatoes. There are as many variations on the word as there are
cooks in Italy.</LD>
<TE>   Mention it in my family, though, and one dish immediately comes to
mind: potato pie. My Great, Great-Grandmother Angela Sbona  brought the
recipe with her from Melilli, Sicily, in 1905. Every Italian immigrant in
the Connecticut river town where the family settled had his or her own
variation of schiacciata. Those who could afford it stuffed their dough
with meat. Some adorned theirs with no more than cold-pressed olive oil
and salt.</TE>
<TE>   Angela stuck to what was in her cupboard and backyard: She fried up
potatoes, onions, garlic and olive oil, tossed in a few capers and
tomatoes dried in the sun, and wrapped the whole delicious mess in
freshly kneaded dough. Then she sprinkled Parmigiano-Reggiano and black
pepper over it, put it in the oven and moved on to tackle the next supper
dish. My Great-Aunt Pip, Angela's youngest daughter, is now keeper of the
recipe. For years at our family reunions, she made sure her schiacciata
di patate got as much play as the hamburgers, hot dogs and clams on the
half shell did on the red-and-white-checked tablecloth.</TE>
<TE>   Angela's descendants haven't strayed far from her recipe. The secret
is to fry the onions and potatoes separately, then marry them into one
glossy mound just before adding them to the dough. My husband spices the
dough up a bit by adding crushed red pepper and garlic powder. Others
toss in some grilled Italian sausage with the potatoes for a hearty
one-dish meal.</TE>
<TE>   Aunt Pip says her mother would serve the pie with an oil-and-vinegar
salad and green peppers roasted over the stove's gas flame. And that was
just for starters.</TE>
<TE>   "There were always one or two more dishes after that," Pip recalls.
"You know how they used to cook.</TE>
<TE>Schiacciata Di Patate</TE>
<TE>   (Potato Pie)</TE>
<TE>   Serves 4 to 6</TE>
<TE>   Dough</TE>
<TE>   1 1/3  cup warm water</TE>
<TE>   2 1/4  teaspoons yeast</TE>
<TE>   3 cups flour</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for bowl</TE>
<TE>   Pinch of salt</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Filling</TE>
<TE>   5 tablespoons cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for pan</TE>
<TE>   2 garlic cloves, minced</TE>
<TE>   5 potatoes, sliced</TE>
<TE>   1 large onion, sliced</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons washed capers</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons dried tomatoes, diced (optional)</TE>
<TE>   Parmigiano-Reggiano</TE>
<TE>   Salt and pepper</TE>
<TE>   Mix yeast and warm water in a large bowl, and let stand 5 minutes. Add
flour, olive oil and salt and mix together until smooth and elastic.
Cover with plastic wrap and put aside until dough doubles in size, about
2 hours. Punch dough down and divide in two. Wrap each piece loosely in
plastic and let stand 10 to 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet. Add one  minced garlic
clove, then potatoes and salt and pepper to taste. Fry over medium-high
heat 20 minutes until potatoes start to turn brown. In a separate pan,
heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil and add remaining garlic, onions and salt
and pepper. Fry over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes. Just before
onions are done, mix in the capers. Combine potatoes and onions in a
large bowl and allow to cool.</TE>
<TE>   Roll out half the dough and stretch thinly across the  bottom of a
lightly oiled 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Spoon potatoes and onions evenly
over dough. Sprinkle sundried tomatoes on top. Roll out other half of
dough and stretch it across the top of potato mixture. Seal edges all
around.</TE>
<TE>   Cut a few slots in the top to allow steam to escape. Brush with olive
oil and sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano and black pepper. Bake for 25
to 35 minutes in a 350-degree oven, or until top turns golden brown.
Allow to cool before serving.</TE>

<HD>Steak for the Traditionalist</HD>
<DH>Mastro's Is Big on Portions, Fun and Celebrities</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of my frequent dining companions occasionally mentions that his
mother is a butcher's daughter. He loves to recount how when he goes over
to her house for Friday night dinner, she roasts or braises a nice piece
of beef for everyone but him; he gets a baked frozen chicken breast. It
serves him right for being a cardiologist. While I wouldn't usually
enlist my friend to go with me to a steakhouse, his mother seems the
perfect dinner companion for the new Mastro's Steakhouse in Beverly
Hills, a 5-month-old import from Scottsdale, Ariz.</LD>
<LD>   As we settle at a large table with a view of the kitchen, Dr. B, as
I'll call him, looks up from the menu and innocently asks his mom the
difference between a rib-eye and a porterhouse. Charlotte rolls her eyes
and mock complains that her boys never learn. Dr. B is just asking,
anyway. He's having fish.</LD>
<LD>   Charlotte looks over the steak selection and doesn't hesitate: She
orders the rib-eye, pointing out to her son that beef cooked on the bone
is more flavorful. "Take the bone out of the porterhouse, and you've got
the New York strip on one side, and a filet on the other," she lectures.
He pretends he's interested.</LD>
<TE>   When her steak comes, it's just as she ordered--charred medium rare.
Tender and juicy, it gets high marks for flavor. I'm confronting the
special bone-in filet, touted as the best steak in the house. It's
rectangular, with a blade of bone at the top. When I cut it, it's
slippery soft. Charlotte takes a bite. "I've always hated filet," she
says, grimacing. "The texture is almost liver-y." I fully agree.</TE>
<TE>   To the delight of those who love to gnaw on bones, Mastro's is very
big on them. The menu usually offers four or five steaks cooked on the
bone, including a Kansas City strip and a veal bone-in strip. It's a
craving a lot of Angelenos must share because the place is packed. Limos
idle at the curb, disgorging a well-padded crowd--women replete with
bouffant hairdos and chin tucks, men in double-breasted suits with
handkerchiefs peeking from their pockets and polished Gucci loafers on
their feet. Inside, a clutch of managers snaps to attention.</TE>
<TE>   Set in the radically remodeled space that was once home to the failed
remake of Chasen's on Canon Drive, Mastro's has the look of a suburban
outpost with its flagstone pillars, startling blue-glass facade and shiny
gold letters. Downstairs is a small bar and a large, dark dining room.
Most of the action is upstairs, though, especially for those old--or
young--enough to remember the original Rat Pack, and who like to start
the evening off with a martini or a Scotch on the rocks. A
larger-than-life portrait of Dominic Mastro, father of founder Dennis
Mastro, seems to float, disconcertingly, at the top of the stairs. Just
behind, squeezed into a corner near the bar, a lounge act earnestly belts
out upbeat standards.</TE>
<TE>   On another night, without Charlotte, as we wait upstairs for our
table, a gallant gent with a removable pompadour offers me his seat.
Where am I? It feels like a different world, one full of good cheer and
incorrigible party animals sneaking a smoke on the balcony. It's easy to
call it a Beverly Hills cliche, but did anybody expect Mastro's to be
this much fun? Or to find so many show-biz legends checking out the
scene? At one long table, where a birthday girl is busy opening presents,
somebody is wearing a leopard-print toilet-seat cover on his head.</TE>
<TE>   But back to the appetizers. You've got to be in a certain mood to
appreciate the standard shrimp cocktail served in a dish that spews dry
ice smoke. I'm all for theatrics, but the shrimp could have more flavor.
The king crab legs seem awfully skimpy for the price. Talk about retro:
Check out the big white mushroom caps stuffed with crab, bread crumbs and
so much garlic you can smell them coming across the room. Fat onion rings
coated in crunchy bread crumbs are messy and greasy, but they grow on
you. What about the toasted ravioli? These are as big as hockey pucks,
heavy with cheese, rolled in the same bread crumbs, "toasted" and served
with an oregano-dosed marinara sauce that must have been simmering for
hours, if not days.</TE>
<TE>   When a friend and I decide to share the double porterhouse, charred
medium rare, it comes to the table already cut off the bone, sliced and
put back together like a jigsaw puzzle. Eyeing it, we worry that it's
overcooked, but we discover that it's absolutely perfect, with a silky
tenderness. A couple of times, though, our steaks here weren't as
correct. For a change, try the juicy pork porterhouse--one of the best
items on the menu. The butcher's daughter also likes the rack of lamb
because it really tastes like lamb.</TE>
<TE>   As for side orders, two or three for the table should do because
they're large. These include a respectable baked potato with all the
fixings and decent sauteed spinach. The gooey and rich au gratin potatoes
get a recommendation, too, along with the excellent shoestrings. Skip the
gluey mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach or creamed corn, both of
which are more cream than vegetable.</TE>
<TE>   Mastro's wine list, crammed onto a single long sheet so that anyone
over 40 requires a magnifying glass to read it, includes a number of
three-figure Cabernets and Meritage blends. And if you've always wanted
to try the 1995 Opus One, well, here's your $275 chance. As wine lists
go, this one is middle of the road, heavy on established California
labels. The wine room off the lounge area seems more a place to show off
big bottles than for serious drinking.</TE>
<TE>   Most steakhouses seem to count on few clients making it to dessert,
and Mastro's is no exception. The billowy key lime pie is excruciatingly
sweet, the pecan pie more fluffy than properly dense.  Our table leaves
Valrhona chocolate ice cream practically untouched because of a peculiar
soapy taste.</TE>
<TE>   Your bill can quickly escalate if you're not vigilant about extras.
Coffee is a whopping $3.50, as is hot tea. Still, if you order carefully
and share appetizers and sides, Mastro's, surprisingly, can come out to
just over $50 per person before tax and tip.</TE>
<TE>   Mastro's touts itself as the steakhouse with a personality, but
despite the quality of the beef, it falls squarely in the traditional
steakhouse category. Big drinks, big steaks and few appetizers, sides or
desserts that pass muster. It's steakhouse as usual. Except for the
number of bones.</TE>

<HD>DNA Tests Hint of New Vices in Old West</HD>
<DH>History: Nevada's Virginia City was the hard-living capital of the
frontier. Morphine residue could indicate an opium den.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SONNER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>VIRGINIA CITY, Nev.
</DL>
<LD>Archeologists combing through artifacts beneath the burned
floorboards of this 19th-century mining town are using DNA testing in a
way it's never been used before: to learn new secrets about the Old West.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the tests just down the hill from the Bucket of Blood Saloon
might tell a story of the frontier rarely seen in Westerns or on the old
"Bonanza" television series that helped make Virginia City famous.</LD>
<LD>   Beneath one small home at 18 North G Street, traces of morphine have
been detected on a 125-year-old glass hypodermic syringe. Researchers
believe they've found either an opium den or the office of a doctor who
treated prostitutes and their customers on the edge of the town's
rollicking red-light district in the 1860s and 1870s.</LD>
<TE>   It is believed to be the first time DNA residue has been extracted
from historical artifacts other than human remains, according to
independent experts and leaders of the joint research by Portland State
University and the Nevada State Historic Preservation Office.</TE>
<TE>   They say the technique using nuclear DNA testing will help give
historians a better glimpse into daily life on the Western frontier,
including the racial makeup of the townspeople.</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood has made us think of Virginia City as a 'Bonanza'-type
setting, and even tourism today has carried that theme," said Julie
Schablitsky, an archeologist in Portland State's Urban Studies and
Planning Department who first presented the findings last month at the
Society for Historical Archaeology's annual conference in Mobile, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   "As archeologists and historians, we need to set the record straight,"
she said from Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an area where people from all over the world toiled hard
above and below the ground. . . . Back then you could get morphine and a
syringe at the local pharmacy. It was not a big deal," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the syringe and six associated needles, the DNA testing
confirmed they'd been used by at least four people, both men and women,
including at least one black.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the ability to use DNA to link sex, race and number of
people to specific personal items recovered at archeological sites is a
breakthrough.</TE>
<TE>   "Schablitsky's innovative application of DNA analysis opens up an
entirely new way of documenting and understanding their lives from the
material things that they left behind," said Donald Hardesty, an
anthropology professor at the University of Nevada at Reno, who
specializes in the American West.</TE>
<TE>   At its peak in the 1860s, Virginia City was "one of the great mining
districts of the world, one of the richest places ever found in human
history," said Ron James, Nevada's state historic preservation officer
and the author of two books on Comstock history.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a very good idea from what was written at the time of what it
was like to be white, rich and male in 19th-century Virginia City. But
the rest of the story has to be pieced together by whatever means," James
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you can talk about working-class men, women and minorities,
that provides a great opportunity to make the picture of history more
clear."</TE>
<TE>   Doug Scott, an archeologist for the National Park Service's Midwest
Archaeological Center in Lincoln, Neb., has used DNA testing of human
remains--but not artifacts--in studies of Civil War and Indian
battlefields.</TE>
<TE>   "It is pretty exciting to think there is the potential for recovering
this type of information, even after 125 years in the ground," said
Scott, who has worked with the United Nations and international
human-rights groups to identify remains of victims of war crimes and
atrocities in Croatia, Bosnia and El Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   "They got some incredible information from those needles and syringe
about a very small slice of time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "And it's more complex. It's not the simple view of the world of how
things were in the good old days," Scott said. "There were people with
reasons to be taking drugs, whether it was recreational or they had pain
or medical problems."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier research has established that Virginia City, with a population
of 60,000 at its peak, was unusually diverse for its time. Large
populations of ethnic groups--including Africans, Jamaicans, Chinese,
Irish and Germans--worked area gold and silver mines.</TE>
<TE>   "At any one time, about 50% of the people there were immigrants from
other places. It was a mixed racial group," Schablitsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Virginia City burned during a great fire in 1875, providing a
clear mark in the soil that archeologists can use to help gauge the age
of various artifacts.</TE>
<TE>   When Schablitsky began digging in the summer of 2000, she expected to
find beads, buttons and straight pins used by the dressmaker who once
operated a shop there, as well as marbles and children's toys from the
family of British immigrants who later lived in the house.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't expect to discover a syringe and needles and an irrigator,"
said Schablitsky, whose find left her wondering how she could learn more.</TE>
<TE>   "I started considering my options. DNA is a household name now. We
have shows like "CSI"--Crime Scene Investigation. I thought, maybe we can
get some DNA off this," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The morphine on the syringe was confirmed by Dr. Raymond Grimsbo at
the Intermountain Forensic Laboratories Inc. in Portland, Ore. He set the
tests to recover degraded morphine because historical medical manuals
discuss the frequent hypodermic injection of morphine during the 1870s
and 1880s.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the needles and syringe found beneath the floorboards,
researchers discovered a urethral irrigator used to treat venereal
disease symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Historical documents indicate the home at 18 North G Street likely was
built in the 1860s in the working-class neighborhood between Chinatown
and the red-light district.</TE>
<TE>   The dressmaker, Mrs. M.A. Andrews, operated a shop at the location in
1873. But by 1875, a British immigrant family, the Coopers, moved into
the home. Thomas Cooper worked as a carpenter and lived in the house with
his wife and three children.</TE>
<TE>   Schablitsky said forensic results eliminated Andrews and members of
the Cooper family as the syringe users.</TE>
<TE>   One possibility is that during the late 1860s or early 1870s, at least
four adults were involved in a social gathering in which morphine was
injected for euphoric effects, Schablitsky said. When the needles became
dull or damaged, they could have been discarded into the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Schablitsky said a more realistic theory is that a doctor who
specialized in treating venereal diseases was operating out of the house.</TE>
<TE>   "People of all different races might have been going to this one
doctor," Schablitsky said. "It could give us a better idea of how people
in the past operated with each other at a racial level."</TE>

<HD>Airport's Slots Are on a Roll in Vegas</HD>
<DH>Trends: Thanks to new security measures and corresponding delays,
travelers are gambling more while they wait.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN RITTER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS
</DL>
<LD>Air travelers are arriving hours early these days and gambling more
at McCarran International Airport, where slot machines sit side-by-side
with baggage carousels and departure gates.</LD>
<LD>   The result of tightened security after Sept. 11 has been a windfall
for the nation's seventh-largest airport as gambling revenues and some
other concessions have taken off.</LD>
<LD>   "It's hurry up and wait," said Sandy Ortiz, 56, waiting in Las Vegas
for a flight to San Jose and sipping a cup of Starbuck's coffee. Her
husband gave in to a beckoning slot machine.</LD>
<TE>   "That machine, right there," 59-year-old Adolph Ortiz said with a
grin. "It's saying, 'Adolph, come here!' "</TE>
<TE>   "In San Francisco, San Jose or Denver, we just sit and read," Sandy
Ortiz said.</TE>
<TE>   McCarran's slots cleared almost a half-million dollars more in
October, November and December than in the same three months of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "People with more time to spare are spending money in our slots and
our restaurants and shops," airport spokeswoman Hilarie Grey said.</TE>
<TE>   In some airports, despite significant drops in passenger numbers,
concession sales have remained steady--indicating that after clearing
security, passengers are spending more than spare change in their spare
time.</TE>
<TE>   "Previously, where people would go out and have a latte, now they're
having lunch," said Bob Parker, spokesman for Seattle-Tacoma
International Airport in Washington state. "They've got more time."</TE>
<TE>   McCarran, unique among major U.S. airports in offering slot machines
in airport concourses and gate waiting areas, has hit a jackpot of its
own.</TE>
<TE>   Even though 1.5 million fewer passengers passed through the Las Vegas
airport in the last three months of 2001, compared with the year before,
McCarran raked in $8.5 million--$473,618 extra--in slot revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Kichline, airport business manager, said the $41 million the
airport reaps annually in slot revenues provides "a nice cash cushion to
weather tough times that come along."</TE>
<TE>   The ka-ching of slots has mixed with boarding calls at McCarran since
1968. It isn't the only airport in America with slot machines--Reno-Tahoe
International has 237--but it is the largest, with 1,308 one-armed
bandits.</TE>
<TE>   Popular lore says slot machines at the airport are less likely to pay
off big than slots at Las Vegas casinos. But there is never a shortage of
players among the 35 million passengers passing through McCarran
annually.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an hour's entertainment," said Bernie Rich, 59, a Bloomingdale,
Ill., resident who walked away with $4.70 after plunking $10 into a slot
machine while waiting for his aunt to arrive.</TE>
<TE>   Rich's wife, Dolores, and a cousin, Marie Boyd, spent the hour
cruising the shops of a pre-security concourse featuring souvenir stores
with Las Vegas Strip hotel themes, a newsstand-bookstore, chocolate,
clothing, jewelry and coffee shops, and even a cigar stand.</TE>
<TE>   "What we call dwell time, or waiting time, has gone up," said David
Milobsky, an analyst for HMS Host Corp., a Bethesda, Md., company that
operates food and beverage concessions at McCarran.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true there are fewer people flying, but the people who are
flying have more time," he said. "With more time on their hands, that
gives them time to eat or shop or what have you."</TE>
<TE>   HMS Host serves 64 airports in North America and six overseas.
Milobsky said concession sales have been inconsistent.</TE>
<TE>   "Some properties have really suffered," he said. "Some are still way
behind from a sales perspective where they were last year. On a national
basis, the two things we look at are airline capacity and passenger
emplanements. Those two things are still down."</TE>
<TE>   Phil Orlandella, spokesman for the Massachusetts Port Authority, said
that with 23.5% fewer passengers passing through Logan Airport's gates in
December 2001 compared with a year earlier, retail and restaurant
business at the Boston airport has suffered.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't have time to shop," Orlandella said. "They're standing
in security lines."</TE>
<TE>   Increased security has been a double-edged sword for Kathy Hussey,
general manager at McCarran for Atlanta-based WH Smith Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "Lines sometimes are so long that by the time people get through they
have no time to shop," she said. "Other times, people get here early,
expecting long lines."</TE>
<TE>   But with other airports around the nation suffering from greater
declines in passenger traffic and sales, Hussey said her group of 16
newsstands and bookstores vaulted from fourth to the top in sales among
23 airports in North America.</TE>
<TE>   "It does seem like people are reading more--not only books, but also
newspapers and news magazines, because they're trying to keep up with the
news," Hussey said.</TE>

<HD>Bay Area May Be in Hot Water Over Dumping</HD>
<DH>Environment: Radioactive waste site near Golden Gate Bridge is
raising concerns over unknown contamination levels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>COLLEEN VALLES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>Over 24 years, the government and private research agencies dumped
almost 48,000 55-gallon drums of radioactive waste just a few miles west
of the Golden Gate Bridge.</LD>
<LD>   That waste now is leaking into the Gulf of the Farallones National
Marine Sanctuary--and no one knows how much contamination it is causing
in seafood. Federal officials say they don't have the money to determine
the extent of the damage.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists have studied and mapped only 15% of the disposal site, and
the little they did see suggests that most of the radiation leaking from
the barrels is not higher than what occurs naturally.</LD>
<TE>   Still, environmentalists say more research must be done to gauge the
effect on the area's rich marine life.</TE>
<TE>   "If it is getting into the food chain, what precautions are being
taken?" said Maurice Campbell, a member of Community First Coalition,
which has pushed for a government cleanup of radioactive waste in San
Francisco's former Navy base. "There should be an independent study."</TE>
<TE>   The marine sanctuary surrounds the Farallon Islands, themselves a
national wildlife refuge, and protects 1,225 square miles of ocean. The
area is home to 36 species of marine mammals, and teems with so much sea
life that albatrosses have been known to fly 5,000-mile round trips from
Midway Island and back to feed themselves and their young on what they
gathered at the Farallones. Commercial and sport fishermen also harvest a
variety of deep sea and shallow water fish there.</TE>
<TE>   Only limited testing has been done on sediment and ground fish at the
dump site, and no agency has budgeted closer looks at the problem, said
sanctuary manager Edward Ueber.</TE>
<TE>   Worried residents and environmentalists hope an ongoing National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration review of the sanctuary's
management plan will address monitoring of the dump site.</TE>
<TE>   Most agree that cleaning the area could make things worse. Some of the
drums were sunk with bullet holes, and most are so corroded that moving
them would spread more radioactive waste.</TE>
<TE>   Even with money, getting to the drums would be difficult. They were
dumped over 540 square miles in water 300 to 6,000 feet deep along the
edge of the continental shelf, an area crisscrossed with canyons and
gullies. Most submarines that dive deeper than 2,000 feet aren't
available on the West Coast, Ueber said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of that waste is radioactive material and contaminated gloves and
uniforms from national laboratories administered by the University of
California and now-defunct Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory in San
Francisco. It was dumped between 1946 and 1970 at what then was called
the Farallon Islands Nuclear Waste Site.</TE>
<TE>   Two other primary radioactive waste dump sites for the United States,
located about 120 miles off the coast of Maryland and Delaware, were also
used before the Ocean Dumping Act banned such dumping in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   Herman Karl, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, acknowledged
that his agency hadn't surveyed most of the radioactive mess.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't able to go to the area where 40-some-thousand were
dropped," Karl said. "We didn't have the time or the money."</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, Karl surveyed what he could from a submarine, and
unmanned submersibles mapped the barrels. The USGS study concluded that
leakage raised radiation levels only slightly in nearby sediments. A 1991
survey by NOAA and the Environmental Protection Agency also found only
low-level radiation.</TE>
<TE>   "A big concern is that there was so much dumping in the '50s, and is
it continuing to have problems?" said Janet Hashimoto, of the EPA's
regional office in San Francisco. "All of the balances indicated that
there was very low radiation, and sometimes, it was at background level."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the commercial fish harvested in the region--Pacific herring,
salmon, rockfish, albacore tuna and Dungeness crab--live at depths
shallower than the nearby drums, and government tests on seafood every
few years have not shown cause for alarm, said Zeke Grader, executive
director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing we want is to have any tainted fish getting on the
market," Grader said. "That's just risking consumers' health and we want
to assure them what they're buying is safe."</TE>
<TE>   However, elevated radiation levels have shown up in Dover sole and
some other deep-sea fish that people eat, according to a study published
in 1996 by Thomas Suchanek, then a research ecologist with UC Davis.</TE>
<TE>   To see just how far the radioactivity has spread, more testing should
be done on organisms that live their entire lives near the barrels, said
Suchanek, now a deputy director of environmental contaminants with the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</TE>
<TE>   Though a USGS study concluded that currents probably won't carry
contaminants through the Golden Gate and into the bay, some Bay Area
residents want more monitoring to make sure the radioactivity isn't
entering the food chain or washing onto Northern California's beaches.</TE>
<TE>   "The real solution there is ongoing monitoring and taking tissues from
the sea life and water fowl," said Saul Bloom, executive director of Arc
Ecology, a public interest group that has followed the issue. "That has
to happen on a regular basis."</TE>
<TE>   But the effect of the waste on the rich life of the sanctuary is
unknown, Bloom said.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I know, we know the most about it, and that's pretty . . .
sad."</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>One thing is certain about the radioactive waste at the Gulf of the
Farallones National Marine Sanctuary--no one knows much about it.</LD>
<LD>   Government tests have shown low levels of radiation leaking from the
corroding drums that were dumped between 1946 and 1970 at what was then
the Farallon Islands Nuclear Waste Site. The U.S. Geological Survey has
studied only 15%of the almost 48,000 55-gallon drums.</LD>
<LD>   How that waste has moved through ocean currents and affected marine
life is even less documented.</LD>
<TE>   In 1996, ecologist Thomas Suchanek studied deep-sea bottom-feeding
fish harvested for food--Dover sole, sablefish and two different species
of thornyheads--from the waste site and from Point Arena, about 62 miles
north.</TE>
<TE>   Suchanek tagged and tracked the fish, which can go as deep as 1,200
feet, and tested them for cesium 137, plutonium 238, 239 and 240 and
americium 241. For cesium and plutonium, levels were near background, but
for the americium, an artificially produced element, levels were
elevated.</TE>
<TE>   Americium is used in industrial measuring devices, such as gauging
thickness in the glass industry, in radiology and in household smoke
detectors. Some is also produced from plutonium in nuclear reactors.</TE>
<TE>   Because the fish studied move around so much--some went as far away as
Japan--it's unclear if they were contaminated at the Farallones or at
another site contaminated by humans somewhere in the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "It's possible that the nuclear waste might be transported from the
Farallones up north; it's possible that all these areas are
contaminated," Suchanek said. "It's unclear how long any individual fish
would spend feeding along the dump site."</TE>
<TE>   Suchanek, now a deputy director of environmental contaminants with the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, recommended then and still advocates
examining organisms that live their entire lives near the nuclear waste,
such as worms and crustaceans that live in sediment.</TE>

<HD>Fossil Names Remain a Work in Progress</HD>
<DH>Science: Updates in proper identification can lag for years--or
even centuries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BRIDGES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Along with a state bird, butterfly, fish and tree, California
boasts its own fossil, Smilodon californicus, or Californian saber-tooth
cat.</LD>
<LD>   Problem is, there was no such species.</LD>
<LD>   Rather, there was once such an animal, skeletons of which have been
found by the hundreds at the La Brea Tar Pits. But the name of the
species was tossed out by scientists in the 1980s in favor of Smilodon
fatalis.</LD>
<TE>   For decades before then, paleontologists had attached the names to
what they thought were two distinct species. They now believe they were
one.</TE>
<TE>   "The scientific name has changed, but it's still the same animal,"
said John Harris, chief curator of the Natural History Museum of Los
Angeles County's George C. Page Museum of La Brea Discoveries.</TE>
<TE>   While the name S. californicus remains enshrined in California
law--and, for the time being, on exhibit labels at the Tar Pits
museum--it is considered an invalid name in paleontological databases of
fossil North American mammal species.</TE>
<TE>   Countless more bad names lurk within those databases, which tally the
currently used names of the roughly 3,300 species of mammals known to
have lived over the last 146 million years.</TE>
<TE>   A single species can bear multiple names: S. fatalis has had as many
as six. And sometimes multiple species are fixed with a single name. In
other cases, the remains of female and male examples of a creature can be
mistakenly dubbed as separate species.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is hardly rare, or even unique to extinct mammals. The
brontosaurus, for one, is properly known as the apatosaurus by dinosaur
experts. Nor are the living exempt: the taxonomy of living insects is
notoriously muddled.</TE>
<TE>   But fossil remains can be particularly vexing, because not every
species is preserved in the fossil record. When remains are found, they
can be so fragmentary that scientists often have little more than a
single tooth on which to base the identification of a new species.</TE>
<TE>   As a consequence, the name game is in constant flux.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know taxonomy is a work in progress, as all science is, and
nobody thinks they know the final truth," said Scott Wing, a research
paleobiologist at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of
Natural History in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   The naming errors have crept in, slowly and surely, ever since
Sweden's Carl Linnaeus began the modern system of classifying living
things in the 1730s.</TE>
<TE>   "Taxonomists aren't gods, they're people, so that's the way it goes,"
said John Alroy, a researcher at the National Center for Ecological
Analysis and Synthesis at UC Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Under the system, newly discovered species are given a binomial, or
double, name in Latin. The first name refers to the genus of the species.
The second typically refers to some attribute of either the species
itself or the person who discovered it.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody knows for certain how many invalid names there might be. Alroy
has taken a stab at it, using a statistical model to estimate a whopping
24% to 30% of the total number of known fossil North American mammal
species names are no good.</TE>
<TE>   "The key thing is it's a problem people ignore. But these are huge
percentages," said Alroy, who presented his results at a Geological
Society of America meeting last fall.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers are significant because they allow scientists to estimate
patterns of biodiversity and extinction rates in the past--and how they
might compare to those in the present, Alroy said.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts dispute that so many names could prove invalid. Harris
said he would estimate the amount to fall between 5% and 10%.</TE>
<TE>   "I assume there has been some problem in the past, but people by and
large strive for accuracy and truth. They're not going out of their way
to name new species," Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   When errors do crop up, the fixes do come but far more slowly than
does the steady stream of new names. In May 1982, for example, two
scientists, working independently, gave the same set of fossilized
remains of a Miocene raccoon entirely different scientific names. The
confusion took until 1989 to settle.</TE>
<TE>   And just a few months ago, scientists at the Page Museum in Los
Angeles quietly swapped out the label on their Mammuthus imperator, or
Imperial mammoth, exhibit. The creature is now known as M. columbi, or
the Columbian mammoth, which, again, had been thought to represent a
distinct species.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that new names are bad right off the bat; it's that it takes
time to catch them," Alroy said.</TE>
<TE>   Vetting the balance of the lists of fossil North American mammals
could take 1,000 years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The final number of valid fossil species names, no matter how large,
still pales in comparison to the ranks of now-extinct creatures that have
yet to be discovered or described.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know there's a problem; it's nice to know how big the problem
is. But it's still much less of a problem than what we don't know yet,"
Harris said.</TE>

<HD>Rare Jellyfish Fossils Unearthed in Wisconsin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BRIDGES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than a half-billion years ago, thousands of jellyfish were
washed up in a small lagoon, stranded by a freak tide or storm and buried
by sand just hours later.</LD>
<LD>   Fossilized impressions of those jellyfish, some up to 3 feet in
diameter, have now been discovered in a Wisconsin quarry, in what
scientists say is one of the largest finds of its kind in the world.</LD>
<LD>   "Preservation of a soft-bodied organism is incredibly rare, but a
whole deposit of them is like finding your own vein of gold," said James
Hagadorn, a scientist at the Cal Tech in Pasadena and co-author of an
article reporting the find in February's issue of the journal Geology.</LD>
<TE>   The jellyfish, which have no durable body parts, were fossilized
during the ancient Cambrian period, when the world's oceans exploded with
a diversity of life. The creatures were apparently buried within hours
after being stranded in a shallow lagoon about 510 million years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Fossil dealer Dan Damrow, an article co-author, discovered the
jellyfish about four years ago in a quarry in Mosinee, Wis., about 200
miles northwest of Milwaukee. In the quarry, beds of sandstone lie
stacked horizontally in neat layers--perfect for flagstone and other
commercial uses.</TE>
<TE>   "These could have ended up as someone's bathroom floor or in their
side garden," Hagadorn said.</TE>
<TE>   Hagadorn said they found fossilized jellyfish in seven layers in the
quarry, encased in about 12 vertical feet of rock representing a span of
time of up to 1 million years.</TE>
<TE>   The layers of rock also record the delicate ripples that striped the
ocean bottom in what were presumably shallow coastal waters.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives you a kind of aura of standing in this instant in time,"
Damrow said. "You're standing right on that beach just as it formed."</TE>
<TE>   Circular impressions mark where each jellyfish was washed ashore,
probably during a storm-enhanced high tide, Hagadorn said. Each fossil
typically includes a concave, circular shape that records the tiny moat
excavated by the pumping action of the bell-shaped jellyfish as it
attempted to swim to deeper water.</TE>
<TE>   Surrounding that ring, a rim of higher rock represents the sand that
washed against the dead or dying jellyfish in subsequent tides. Tiny
piles in the center is likely sand ingested by the creature as it
struggled, Hagadorn said.</TE>
<TE>   The fossilized jellyfish appear similar in size and characteristics to
their modern brethren, but the specific species cannot be pinpointed.</TE>
<TE>   Beached jellyfish now fall prey to everything from birds to curious
children. In the Cambrian period, however, there were few scavengers to
disturb the creatures once they were grounded and buried, Hagadorn said.
That, and the speed with which they were buried, accounted for their
survival in the fossil record, he said.</TE>

<HD>Tiny Washington Towns Are Feeling Recession's Pinch</HD>
<DH>Northwest: As state cuts subsidies to balance its own budget,
lights flicker on Main Street. Some communities may not survive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA ASHTON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHTUCNA, Wash.
</DL>
<LD>With wheat fortunes in decline and the state budget $1 billion in
the red, this tiny farm town with a 124-year past may not have a future.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Neil Todd has raised the possibility that, come 2003--if the
state balances its budget by cutting subsidies to local
governments--Washtucna might cease to exist.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not hollering wolf. I just want some answers," says Todd, mayor
of Adams County's oldest town for two years.</LD>
<TE>   Across the country, recession has put a girdle on government funding,
just as governments spend more on public safety and protecting critical
infrastructure in a post-Sept. 11 world.</TE>
<TE>   "We're reading in state news every day where state budgets are being
limited and being downsized because of a revenue loss," says Deborah
Rigsby, senior legislative counsel for the National League of Cities in
Washington, D.C. "There's a trickle-down effect."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington state, Boeing has made plans to lay off tens of
thousands of workers since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and many of
those dot-coms have become dot-gones. But a pair of tax-limiting
initiatives may be what has pushed several small towns in eastern
Washington to the brink of extinction.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, voters repealed with Initiative 695 the state motor-vehicle
excise tax, a portion of which had gone to local governments. The
initiative was tossed out by the courts, but the Legislature responded to
outraged voters and enacted a similar measure.</TE>
<TE>   Flush with revenue from the booming economy along the Interstate 5
corridor, lawmakers also approved a subsidy for local governments, called
the "695 backfill."</TE>
<TE>   But for 2003, Gov. Gary Locke has slashed the $84.6 million in
backfill funds from his proposed budget.</TE>
<TE>   Washtucna has an annual budget of just over $200,000, with about
$22,000 in backfill funds. It's a make-or-break amount of money, since so
much of the town's budget is dedicated to things like maintaining the
sewer and water system.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 266 people of Washtucna seem to understand Todd's dilemma.
When the Town Council raised utility taxes 33% last year, only two people
objected. Utility bills will go up 10% annually for the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm desperately trying to restore our basic services," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The sewer-water tax hike is OK with Rebecca Thompson, who works at the
recently reopened and renamed Pioneer General Store.</TE>
<TE>   "You need towns like this," she says. "I'd pay [higher] taxes to keep
it going. I don't want to see it die."</TE>
<TE>   But another anti-tax measure passed last year, I-747, limits property
tax increases to 1% a year, unless local governments ask voters to
approve more.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see any more local tax as an option," Todd says. "The
majority of our community is low to moderate income."</TE>
<TE>   Washtucna has no police force. The town has one full-time employee and
one part time. Todd makes $300 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Grain silos dominate the skyline. There's a drive-in restaurant, and
Sonny's Tavern, with its sign advertising "Good Food," an espresso-flower
shop-convenience store, and a bank. The little grocery store reopened
Dec. 8 and needs a license before it can sell beer and cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Main Street is boarded up. The turn-of-the-century doctor's
house on the hill burned recently and probably won't be rebuilt. No one
was living there.</TE>
<TE>   Jonnee Hays, 73, and her husband, Tom, moved to Washtucna after he saw
an ad for a mechanic in the newspaper in Spokane, about 90 miles
northeast of here.</TE>
<TE>   "We came here to spend the winter," she says. That was 54 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The downhill slide started as "the roads to the bigger towns got
better. People started going to big towns for better prices for their
commodities," Hays says.</TE>
<TE>   "One by one, the businesses started drifting away."</TE>
<TE>   Technological and global-market forces altered agriculture. Farming
became more mechanized, bringing fewer people to town to work the fields
or demand local services. Then, the federal government's Conservation
Reserve Program paid farmers not to plant their crops.</TE>
<TE>   Washtucna is not alone. This may be the last hurrah for Harrah,
Wapato, Benton City and several other small towns in eastern Washington,
especially those without industry or a lot of merchandising to bring in
property and sales taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Todd wrote a letter seeking advice from Tim Eyman, the one-man machine
behind the tax-limiting initiatives:</TE>
<TE>   "My question is this: Where do I get the money to keep our community
solvent? Are there taxes that we are not aware of? Is the Legislature
stockpiling money that is not generally known to the public or local
officials? I ask that you please enlighten me with viable options so that
I can offer hope to the citizens of our small town."</TE>
<TE>   Eyman says he never received Todd's letter, but when read the above
paragraph, he responded: "Sounds pretty snotty. I don't take it as an
overly serious letter."</TE>
<TE>   Washtucna town government can always ask voters to approve higher
taxes for local programs, Eyman says.</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently, all he wants to do is whine," Eyman says. "If he doesn't
feel up to the task as mayor, he can certainly resign."</TE>

<HD>Campaign Reform Has the Parties Strategizing</HD>
<DH>Fund-raising: New rules mean new respect for the little guy. Trick
is to get more smaller donations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>For the 2000 elections, Vinod Gupta, a high-tech mogul from Omaha,
donated more than $1.2 million to Democratic Party causes and candidates.</LD>
<LD>   As thanks, he had lunch with President Clinton and a few other big
donors at Barbra Streisand's cliff-top Malibu estate. He hobnobbed with
Brad Pitt and other movie stars at a steady stream of parties. Over the
years, he has shared his opinions with presidents and with members of
Congress.</LD>
<LD>   If the campaign finance reform bill that passed the House last week
becomes law, Gupta's cozy political world will disappear: With unlimited
contributions to parties no longer legal, the checks he writes will have
to contain fewer zeros, and they probably won't buy him the same perks.</LD>
<TE>   There will be a new generation of kingmakers under the new rules, but
it will not necessarily be those with bottomless bank accounts. It will
be those who can get a lot of people to make contributions in sizable but
still legal amounts--as much as $2,000 at a time for candidates and
$25,000 for political parties.</TE>
<TE>   So Gupta--and others like him--already are reinventing themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "I pick up the phone, I write letters and e-mails, meet friends at
gatherings," Gupta said. "I think what could happen--the people who can
raise more money through their network and friends will become more
important than someone who can write a large check."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign finance bill may be close to enactment. The Senate, which
passed its own, similar version of campaign finance reform last year,
soon will decide whether to accept the House bill. If it does, the
measure will go to President Bush, who has given the bill's Republican
opponents no strong reason to hope for a veto.</TE>
<TE>   The measure will jolt the process of running for federal office.
Because candidates will have to raise money in smaller amounts, for
example, they may have to spend even more time talking up potential
contributors than they do now.</TE>
<TE>   But the big donors will feel the shock too. Those who may be able to
make an effortless transition from the old world to the new will be the
party stalwarts whose Rolodexes are as thick as their wallets.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone who is skilled at raising money is not extremely common. They
will be even more valuable friends and allies to have now," said Bill
Carrick, a Los Angeles political consultant. "People who aren't good
fund-raisers but are generous with their own money? That sort of
personality will be less influential."</TE>
<TE>   Bradford Freeman, a Los Angeles merchant banker who is a personal
friend of Bush, already has straddled the worlds of big donors and big
fund-raisers. Freeman gave $100,000 to Republican candidates and causes
in the last election cycle--not bad, but not world class.</TE>
<TE>Focus Will Move to Networking</TE>
<TE>   But Freeman's value to his party may lie in what he does best: asking
like-minded others to open their checkbooks. During the 2000 campaign, no
one was better at asking Republicans for money.</TE>
<TE>   "It's what I've been doing forever," Freeman said. "You do the network
thing. You get 10 guys, who get 10 guys."</TE>
<TE>   Freeman was spectacularly successful at bringing in checks for
hundreds of thousands of dollars. But he also was good at collecting lots
of smaller checks.</TE>
<TE>   "We raised $10.5 million for Bush for president in California," at no
more than $1,000 per donor, he said. "It can be done."</TE>
<TE>   But some big political donors say they are unwilling to remake
themselves into fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   The almost $200,000 that Trevor Pearlman donated to Democratic Party
committees and candidates in the last election cycle gave the Dallas
investment banker status as a top contributor. During the 2000 Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles, he and his wife had access to
President Clinton, presidential candidate Al Gore and other top party
luminaries.</TE>
<TE>   He concedes that he's unlikely to keep the same company if the rules
change.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never raised tons of money. My focus has been giving my own
resources," Pearlman said. "Frankly, I don't feel comfortable asking
people to donate. It's not something I enjoy doing. Some people are
better at it than others."</TE>
<TE>Campaigns May Become More Grass-Roots</TE>
<TE>   Pearlman plans to stay politically active, however, and would be
willing to fund-raise if he is really moved by an individual candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "I will channel my energy in a different way. Helping with ideas and
organization," he said. "I think it will actually make the campaigns more
grass-roots."</TE>
<TE>   Just as certain kinds of individual donors will thrive in the new
campaign finance climate, so will certain fund-raising techniques and
skills.</TE>
<TE>   Fussy, high-priced dinners may become fewer. Longtime political hands
say these events make far less sense if their high overheads can't be
offset by huge donor checks.</TE>
<TE>   Consider instead a "cyber cocktail hour" where, for a more modest fee,
the donor might be urged to pour himself a drink while he poses questions
online to a candidate. The ban on "soft money," the unlimited
contributions to national political parties, may accelerate the
ascendance of fund-raisers savvy in using the Internet to reach large
numbers of people willing to donate--a method that costs a fraction of
traditional direct mail and telemarketing.</TE>
<TE>   "Campaign finance reform makes the need to expand your donor base even
greater," said Max Fose, who managed Arizona Republican Sen. John
McCain's highly successful Internet campaign during his 2000 run for the
GOP presidential nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Fose said McCain's success with the Internet, where he earned a
quarter of his donations, proved that campaigns could reach illusive, and
now even more desirable, independent voters and first-time donors.</TE>
<TE>   "It worked," he said, "because you're breaking down the barrier that
exists in campaigns where it's just the same 100 people who volunteer
each time."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, political consultants say the most valuable players will
be those with long mailing and e-mailing lists, distribution systems and
grass-roots, get-out-the-money networks that are ready to go.</TE>
<TE>   "Doctors, lawyers, car dealerships--any situation where you have a
group of people who probably share some political views--being able to
tap into those networks will become very, very important again," said
Carrick, a Democratic strategist who helped manage Richard Riordan's
successful 1997 reelection campaign for mayor of Los Angeles. Carrick
said corporations would quickly relearn old methods of signaling wishes
to their executives.</TE>
<TE>   "Ford Motor Co. would say: 'We think Sen. Jones is great,' " Carrick
said. "And everyone would figure out what they were supposed to do."</TE>
<TE>   Those who want to contribute huge sums probably still will have one
recourse. Analysts say the campaign finance bill's provisions curtailing
money spent by private interest groups on issue advertising probably will
be struck down in the federal courts as an infringement of free speech.
That would enable such groups--from the American Civil Liberties Union to
the National Rifle Assn.--to produce their own ads touting a candidate's
position on a particular issue.</TE>
<TE>   And 1st Amendment protections still make it possible for the very
wealthy to take their personal message directly to the public with
television, radio or print ads, a scenario that makes some political
hands uneasy.</TE>
<TE>Ways to Defeat Spirit of the Bill</TE>
<TE>   "What this bill does is empower these independent groups and wealthy
individuals because they are going to control the political playing
field," said a GOP lobbyist who bitterly opposed the reforms. "Right now
the parties moderate the message. Anyone who thinks this [the reform
bill] gets us fewer attack ads is mistaken."</TE>
<TE>   Political consultants for the two major political parties predict a
whole new class of groups would be created to front political causes and
take in the type of big-money checks that reformers have been trying to
bury.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Gallant, a former aide to Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Texas), already has
created the Republican Majority Issues Committee to raise money and
influence elections.</TE>
<TE>   "People are going to find a way to structure an ad so it's not a
negative ad about a politician as described by [the House bill]," he
said. "There's not a way to stop it."</TE>
<TE>   The prospective loss of six-figure checks from donors like Pearlman
concerns Democratic Party organizers, who concede that their ability to
take in large, soft-money contributions that could be used for
advertising campaigns had made the party less adept at bringing in small
donations.</TE>
<TE>A Need to Appeal to the Little Guy</TE>
<TE>   "We'll just have to find new ways as a party to appeal to smaller
donors," said Jim Jordan, the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee's
executive director. "We've been able to push that aside for the last
couple of cycles. We cannot afford to do that now. But we will certainly
not come anywhere close to matching the Republican donor base in the near
future."</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating the passage of campaign finance reform, the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to the
House of Representatives, has expanded its capabilities of reaching out
to large numbers of potential donors by direct mail and the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "We're prepared for this," committee spokeswoman Jenny Backus said.
Direct-mail donations were up 30% in 2001, she said, when the committee
picked up 150,000 new donors.</TE>
<TE>   At least some major players under the current system said they welcome
the change and believe it will be significant.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Solomont, a major donor and fund-raiser for the Democrats and a
former Democratic National Committee finance chairman, said he did not
think that big corporations and wealthy individuals would find new ways
to funnel the same amount of money into the system through creative new
means.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't jump to donate," he said. "A lot of corporate America
has already grown disgusted with this business."</TE>
<TE>   Gupta, the technology multimillionaire who came to this country from a
poor village in India more than 30 years ago, said he will not miss
writing large checks of his own to political parties.</TE>
<TE>   "I would rather take that money and donate it to social causes like
the women's school in my village in India."</TE>
<TE>   Even though Gupta enjoyed the fruits of the old system, he is not
sorry to see it on its way out.</TE>
<TE>   "The change is happening," he said, "because the system is abused."</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The grimy building off a back street looks like most of the other
minor government ministries here in the Afghan capital. But two flights
underground, past several steel doors, is a prison that was infamous for
its squalor in the days of the Taliban.</LD>
<LD>   Now the dimly lighted and poorly ventilated cells of Department 3 are
occupied by some of the former regime's own, both Afghans and about 110
foreign prisoners. Most of the foreigners are Pakistanis, but they are
joined by several Saudis, a Jordanian, an Egyptian, an Uzbek and two
Tajiks. They are believed to have fought for the Taliban or the Al Qaeda
terrorist network.</LD>
<LD>   Interviews with the foreign prisoners and their keepers suggest that
the nation's interim government has a rough road ahead in determining
what to do with these men. The first difficulty is deciding what role, if
any, each played in the Taliban or Al Qaeda. It is assumed that most of
the foreigners belonged to one or the other, though many refuse to answer
questions about what they were doing in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   Some foreign prisoners who were interviewed claimed that they were
barely aware of the Taliban's existence. Others said that although they
supported the Taliban, they would never fight for it. And an occasional
foreigner voiced admiration for Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Police officers who have questioned the foreign prisoners using tough
interrogation techniques insist that they are all members of Bin Laden's
Al Qaeda network. The truth is difficult to sort out in a world where
lying can be a survival skill: The captors want to show their
effectiveness in their new role as law enforcers, while the captives want
to save their skins. But the accounts of the foreign prisoners suggest
that they had ties to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Zabin, a 22-year-old religion student from Saudi Arabia, insisted that
he had not come to Afghanistan to help the Taliban or battle the United
States. "I was here for military training because I wanted to go to
Palestine for fighting," he said last week.</TE>
<TE>   He said he made his way to this nation at the urging of a mullah in
his hometown. He traveled to Kandahar, where he said he trained at a camp
outside the southern Afghan city under a Syrian commander named Abul
Bara. Then Zabin and 60 other Arabs went to a camp near Kabul run by a
Yemeni named Abu Ayesh. However, Zabin says he does not consider himself
an Al Qaeda member.</TE>
<TE>   Osama Hassan abu Khabir, a 32-year-old Jordanian, said he had come to
Afghanistan for jihad, or religious struggle, but claims that he was
captured before he had a chance to fight.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a fatwa [religious edict] that we should protect Islam from
the attack of America," he said in careful English.</TE>
<TE>   "America is treating Islam badly every place in the world," said
Khabir, who views Bin Laden as a hero. "All Muslims look at Osama as a
good man who is trying to protect Muslims."</TE>
<TE>   "I was happy when I heard about the World Trade Center because I
thought it was all sinners and money that was destroyed," he added. "I
did not know then that . . . civilians had died."</TE>
<TE>   However, Jawad Farouqi, 57, a fluent English speaker who said he was
born in India but lived in Pakistan, insisted that he had come to Kabul
on a pilgrimage. When asked why he had chosen the Afghan capital, which
is not a major destination for such religious quests, he said blandly:
"You can go anywhere for a pilgrimage."</TE>
<TE>   Such a "hear no evil, see no evil" defense is a lie, said Mirzasha
Khan, deputy director of Department 3, part of the Interior Ministry's
security division.</TE>
<TE>   "All of them are members of Al Qaeda, and we have got their
confessions," he said last week. "They said they were supported by Bin
Laden--many of the Pakistanis came from Peshawar [in Pakistan] and they
were fed by him and paid by him."</TE>
<TE>   There are other contradictions between the words of jailer and jailed.
Khabir said he was unarmed and fleeing Kabul after the Taliban's fall
when he and a Singaporean friend were arrested. Khan said that the
Jordanian was heavily armed when apprehended and that the Singaporean
also was an Al Qaeda member. Khan believes that Khabir had been in the
country for at least a year and is highly educated, contrary to the
prisoner's description of himself as only having studied in primary
school.</TE>
<TE>   Khan said most of the foreign prisoners that he has questioned trained
at Al Qaeda camps in Kabul, and some also may have been at camps near the
city of Jalalabad and in Khost, where U.S. forces carried out an
aggressive bombing campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "They said these were camps of Pakistanis and Arabs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   American debriefers have not made their way to Department 3, Khan
said. If they do, in accordance with the interim Afghan government's
policies, they will be permitted to question the prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   It is less clear whether any of the men might be moved to the U.S.
Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where the Americans are holding more
than 250 terrorism suspects captured in Afghanistan. The chief justice of
Afghanistan's Supreme Court recently said he would prefer that the
foreigners be tried in his nation.</TE>
<TE>   The prisoners in Department 3 are just a few of those taken during the
war. Monitors from the International Committee of the Red Cross have
visited about 5,000 men held in 38 prisons around Afghanistan. Some of
the facilities house hundreds of alleged fighters; others are little more
than back rooms of warlords' command posts, with straw strewn on the
floors.</TE>
<TE>   A key question is whether foreigners who were mere foot soldiers for
the Taliban and Al Qaeda should be allowed to go free--treated, like many
of their Afghan counterparts, as prodigal sons. Interim Prime Minister
Hamid Karzai recently ordered the release of and amnesty for about 300
Afghan Taliban, many of whom appear to have been conscripts.</TE>
<TE>   A further dilemma is what to do with those found to have been
noncombatants.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan courts plan to deal with the foreign fighters differently
from other prisoners. There will be a special system in which they will
have their cases heard by a panel of judges selected by the chief
justice, said Ghulam Rasul Rahimi, a senior member of the Supreme Court.
In contrast with the usual Afghan legal system, the foreign Taliban will
have no right to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Punishment for the crimes with which the foreign prisoners probably
will be charged range from long prison terms to death, Rahimi said. From
the Afghan point of view, no punishment is too severe; it is accepted
wisdom here that the country has been cursed by foreigners meddling in
its politics.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Afghan penal code, there is a direct prohibition against
immigrants coming into Afghanistan to fight against the government. This
provision is often noted by Afghan lawyers in describing the foreigners'
alleged crimes. However, whether those who came to support the Taliban
were fighting for or against the government is a point of debate.</TE>
<TE>   At the time that most of the men imprisoned in Department 3 came to
Afghanistan, the Taliban controlled about 90% of the country and was
recognized as the legitimate government by three Islamic countries: Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan. The United Nations
recognized the government of deposed President Burhanuddin Rabbani, whose
alliance controlled only a small area in the north.</TE>
<TE>   Rahimi said the Supreme Court regards Rabbani's government as the
legitimate one at the time and will punish foreigners who fought against
it.</TE>
<TE>   Although much has been made about the possibility that the rights of
prisoners transported to Guantanamo were violated, those prisoners would
have faced harsh conditions here. Sanitation and medical care are limited
in Afghanistan, and spartan meals of rice with kidney beans are served
twice a day in Department 3.</TE>
<TE>   Day and night are little different in the cells. Only a small window
high in the wall of each provides any natural light. Otherwise each room
has a single bare bulb. The cells are almost unbearably tight, with three
men sleeping on the floor and about half a dozen others squeezed onto
cots.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, the prisoners might be more comfortable here because
they are held in groups of eight to 10 and can pray and eat together.</TE>
<TE>   "The first month or six weeks was very difficult. I was alone in the
cell, but now I am with friends," said Khabir, the Jordanian.</TE>
<TE>   Prayer is a constant. A visitor entering the cold corridor can hear
the rhythmic sound of Koranic recitation. Copies of the Koran hang from
the wall in plastic bags to protect them from the damp. Nearly every cell
holds someone who studied as a preacher.</TE>
<TE>   Khan said his investigators make a point of avoiding abusive
techniques against their prisoners. But his description of their approach
leaves some questions. "If you use a stick--as opposed to a carrot--on a
person, he will tell you one word, 'Yes, I did it,' but then in the
future he will say, 'No, I did not mean that.'</TE>
<TE>   "But sometimes it is necessary to use mental pressure," he added. "For
example, we can say, 'We know you've done this and if you don't confess
you will be killed or put in prison.' And then his nerves will be shocked
and he will be afraid."</TE>

<HD>Fallout From Scandal May Spark Reform</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>The pairs figure skating scandal that consumed the first week of
the Winter Games may finally provide the momentum needed to reform a
sport that even high-ranking Olympic leaders call "completely
irredeemable and corrupt."</LD>
<LD>   While the International Skating Union continues its investigation into
the biggest judging scandal in the sport's history, ISU President Ottavio
Cinquanta of Italy said he will raise the issue of reform at a meeting
Monday of the executive council, and will propose using a computer to
analyze judges' scoring over time to detect potential bias.</LD>
<LD>   "This is for giving this sport discipline, maybe a more adequate
system," Cinquanta said. "We are trying very hard constantly and very
hard . . . to improve."</LD>
<TE>   Attempts at change have been introduced over the years, but not
approved. Cinquanta's computer-tracking proposal, in fact, was presented
before but rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Pound, an IOC member from Canada, called figure skating's
judging practices "completely irredeemable and corrupt" and expressed
frustration that more hasn't been done to improve the system.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had blowups in other judgment sports like gymnastics and diving
and synchronized swimming and those sports have responded," he said. "For
whatever reason, that has not happened in figure skating. It is a
separate little fiefdom that now has been exposed in an international
forum like the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   The sport was rocked last week when the ISU determined a French judge
acted improperly by failing to report she had cast her vote under
"pressure" from an unspecified outside source. She cast her gold medal
vote for the Russian pair.</TE>
<TE>   Deciding the ethics breach had created an uneven playing field, the
International Olympic Committee on Friday accepted the ISU's
recommendation to raise silver medalists Jamie Sale and David Pelletier
of Canada to co-gold medalist status, with Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze of Russia. An ISU investigation continues.</TE>
<TE>   The latest controversy came to light when judge Marie Reine Le Gougne
of France allegedly told the referee of the pairs panel on which she
served last week that she had been pressured to vote against her
conscience--and resisted. French Figure Skating President Didier
Gailhaguet, meanwhile, denies any pressure came from his organization.</TE>
<TE>   But contrary to his assertions, The Times has confirmed that the ISU
received five reports on the pairs incident, including two that allege
the Russian and French federations colluded in an attempt to manipulate
Le Gougne's vote for reasons that remain murky.</TE>
<TE>   One of the documents is from Ron Pfenning, the referee of pairs judges
whose initial report to the ISU helped uncover the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Pfenning, back home in Hyannis, Mass., has not returned phone calls
seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   But he told the Chicago Tribune on Saturday he was caught off guard by
the media attention given the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought this would be such a big story. I was just fulfilling
my responsibility," he said. "If it will help the integrity of our sport,
I hope the process goes forward. I would be proud about it."</TE>
<TE>   Another report to the ISU came from Benoit Lavoie, a judge from
Canada, who told the ISU that he had been approached by Le Gougne at the
Skate Canada Grand Prix event in November to discuss the outcome of the
Olympic pairs event.</TE>
<TE>   Lavoie's report also said Le Gougne had told him Russian judge Marina
Sanaia had asked Le Gougne at Skate Canada to favor the Russian pair in
Salt Lake City. Sanaia placed the Russians first in the pairs event
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike sports in which athletes' efforts are timed or measured, figure
skating is virtually impossible to quantify.</TE>
<TE>   One competitor might do more jumps than another, but the number means
little unless balanced by the difficulty of the jumps and the quality of
their execution.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the sport's four disciplines--men's singles, women's singles,
pairs and ice dancing--includes a mark for technique or technical merit,
and another set of marks for presentation.</TE>
<TE>   And that's where the biggest problem lies: the subjectivity of judges
raised in the varied cultural influences of Eastern Europe, Western
Europe, Asia or North America.</TE>
<TE>   "You're never going to get the human element completely out of
it--that subjectivity is one of the hazards of judging sports," said
Kevin Wamsley, director of the International Centre for Olympic Studies
at the University of Western Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   Figure skating's judging process has long been viewed with suspicions
about back-room trades among judges promising to favor each other's
skaters, with coaches openly lobbying judges.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the more recent cases, a one-year suspension was handed down
to Ukrainian judge Yuri Balkov, who was caught on tape telling a Canadian
judge the order of finish at the 1998 Nagano Olympic ice dance
competition before skating had even begun. Balkov is back judging ice
dancing at the Salt Lake Games.</TE>
<TE>   In another case, Russian judge Irina Absalimova was suspended in the
early 1990s for exhibiting "extraordinary national bias." The French
sports magazine L'Equipe, in an extensive story on judging done after the
1998 Olympics, said Russian Figure Skating President Valentin Piseev told
judges, "You will judge the way I want or you will stay at home."</TE>
<TE>   Ice dancer Isabelle Duchesnay said she wasn't surprised by last week's
scandal because she and her brother were told by ice dance officials
before the final phase of the 1992 Albertville Olympic competition they
had no chance to win gold.</TE>
<TE>   "All the titles are decided ahead of time," said Duchesnay, who shared
the 1992 ice dance silver medal with her brother, Paul, in those Games.
She told the French newspaper Le Parisien: "The corruption is so
institutionalized that it had to break out some time."</TE>
<TE>   "They said, 'We're sorry, but you'll only get the silver medal,' " she
said. "When you're in this environment, you think it's normal."</TE>
<TE>   National bias is perhaps the most difficult element to eliminate.</TE>
<TE>   A former U.S. Figure Skating Assn. official candidly recalled last
week the advice he gave U.S. judges as they prepared to officiate at
international competitions.</TE>
<TE>   Call it like you see it, he would tell them, don't cheat, and never do
anything to compromise your integrity. But when asked what to do in
instances when two skaters had performed at an equal level, the official
said he told judges: "Remember who is paying your way."</TE>
<TE>   Even if judges were to be chosen from countries that aren't
represented in a particular competition, or if judges were to be paid for
their services instead of merely getting reimbursed for travel expenses
and meals, a judge's birthplace will often determine his musical tastes,
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   John Nicks, a two-time Olympic pairs skater and 10-time Olympic coach,
laughed when asked about instituting reforms that would bolster the
integrity of judging.</TE>
<TE>   "I have faith in reform," Nicks said, but he is adamant that figure
skating can never be stripped of the subjectivity that international
judges inevitably bring to their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "They're used to their own nation's skaters and their styles. That's
why you have nine judges, so you have some balance."</TE>
<TE>   The nationalities of the judges for the men's, women's and pairs
competitions at the Salt Lake City Games were determined last fall. The
ice dance panel, according to reforms introduced in response to the
Nagano shenanigans, was not determined until the day of the compulsory
dances, the first part of the competition.</TE>
<TE>   Opportunities to make deals might be minimized if judges in the men's,
women's and pairs events were also assigned shortly before the
competition, said Frank Carroll, coach of Olympic bronze medalist Timothy
Goebel.</TE>
<TE>   "They should find out 15 minutes before," he said. "You can't give
them time to know which panel they're going to be on."</TE>
<TE>   The women's competition, which begins Tuesday and is traditionally the
showcase event of the Winter Olympics, is sure to be analyzed
microscopically to determine the fairness of each decision.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Kwan, the six-time U.S. champion and 1998 silver medalist, is
like most competitors who accept the capricious nature of judging.</TE>
<TE>   "People ask me if I get nervous, but it's out of my hands," she said.</TE>

<HD>No Bones About It, the Skeleton Gives Competitors Quite a Rush</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>PARK CITY, Utah
</DL>
<LD>Pulling a 95-pound sled, you bound alongside the track, gaining
speed. All at once you dive headfirst onto your sled. Down you go, chin
hanging off, nose inches from the ice. You whoosh down the slick,
mile-long course at 85 mph, sounding like an accelerating jet plane. You
confront G-force winds on 15 to 20 grueling turns, hoping to high heaven
that your neck muscles can keep your head held up.</LD>
<LD>   This is skeleton: crazy to contemplate, terrifying to watch--and the
latest sport to join the Winter Olympics. Its aficionados say skeleton
takes them over with the rush of a powerful drug.</LD>
<LD>   "I tried it once, and I was instantly hooked. I never looked back,"
said Jim Shea, a third-generation Olympian who is one of five men on the
U.S. skeleton team.</LD>
<TE>   Mess up one turn and it reciprocates all the way down the track. Bump,
bump, bump: That's your shoulder, your knuckles--or worse, your
head--smashing against the track if you don't get it just right. Mass
addiction is unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority of people," Shea noted, "try it once and walk to the
parking lot with their helmets still on and drive away."</TE>
<TE>   But the minority--the certifiable few who are willing to don
skintight, thermodynamic racing suits, helmets that wrap all the way
around to their chins and track shoes with spikes--think it's cool to
pilot something that looks like a high-tech cookie sheet, and win or lose
a race by one one-hundredth of a second. Around the world, there are
perhaps 800 skeleton racers, known as sliders. In this country, the
number is below 200.</TE>
<TE>   LeaAnn Parsley, a 33-year-old firefighter who is one of two women
representing the U.S. in skeleton here, said the sport's novelty is part
of the appeal. What other event, she observed, could you take up three
years ago and now find yourself in the Olympics?</TE>
<TE>   Mostly though, Parsley said, skeleton is about an unbelievable surge
of excitement. She grew almost dreamy as she talked about her first time.</TE>
<TE>   "They said I would either love it or hate it," she recalled. Having
the track lunge right at her, having to make split-second decisions at 80
mph: "I loved it."</TE>
<TE>   Men's skeleton earned a spot at two previous Winter Olympics, in 1928
and 1948. Both Games were held in St. Moritz, Switzerland, where the
sport was born more than 100 years ago and one of the few places where it
was practiced. Never wildly popular, skeleton fell out of vogue until
daredevils rediscovered it in the 1970s. Sliders lobbied to win a berth
for skeleton in the 1998 Winter Games, but until 2002 the sport lacked
the critical ratio of participant athletes and nations required by the
International Olympic Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The Utah Games will mark the first time female sliders have competed
in an Olympics. Medal competition for men and women will take place
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Little known outside Europe, the sport has a lot in common with
bobsledding and luge, but predates both. Skeleton racers share their
track with bobsledders and lugers, sometimes causing high-speed logjams.
Recently, a skeleton slider died in Latvia after a collision with a
bobsledder.</TE>
<TE>   A skeleton sled is so bare-bones that many people think that is where
the sport got its name. No one is quite certain, but others say the name
derives from the deadly fear that overtakes most sane people when they
watch the sport or venture to try it.</TE>
<TE>   The sled, a fiberglass shell with a thin steel frame, is all of 2
inches thick. Roughly 3 feet long by slightly more than a foot wide, it
moves on narrow runners. Skeleton sleds weigh 94.8 pounds for men and
77.2 pounds for women. There are no bells, no whistles, no brakes, no
steering wheels, no gears. Sliders shift knees and drag feet to execute
turns.</TE>
<TE>   Strength is essential, as the skeleton racer must drag the sled for 50
meters before plunging down the track. In the split second of the
transfer from sprinter to slider, the racer must switch from maximum
energy to cool analysis.</TE>
<TE>   If a slider feels that a course is bearing down too fast, that is a
cue that the track and the slider's thought process are out of sync. When
this happens, some part of the slider's body will hit the wall. Shoulders
and knuckles are the most common casualty zones. Torn ligaments and
broken bones abound. But as with luge and bobsledding, fatalities are
rare in skeleton.</TE>
<TE>   With fewer than a dozen tracks around the world, sliders make it their
business to get to know their courses. Many sliders study tapes of the
various tracks. Others spend hours reviewing copious notes.</TE>
<TE>   Cranial wattage is helpful, acknowledged U.S. Olympian Lincoln DeWitt,
who ranks No. 8 in the world. Although, the University of Pennsylvania
graduate admitted, "Some people say, how smart can I be if I'm doing
skeleton?"</TE>
<TE>   Unlike beefed-up bobsledders and lugers, skeleton sliders must have a
thin frame on top and be flexible and muscular on the bottom. Narrow
shoulders are an advantage.</TE>
<TE>   The key to skeleton superiority, said U.S. Olympic team manager Kevin
Ellis, is aerodynamics. Sliders must cut through the wind. Their
shoulders must be close to the sled, even if a wall happens to be headed
straight toward them.</TE>
<TE>   "Your natural instinct when you're looking at a wall when you're going
80 miles an hour is to move away," Ellis said. "You have to come to some
comfort level even if you do hit the wall."</TE>
<TE>   Although the sport looks brutish, skeleton in fact "takes quite a bit
of time to learn properly," said Ryan Davenport, the coach for the U.S.
Olympic team. Aspiring sliders in the U.S. go to skeleton schools--either
at Lake Placid, N.Y., or here in Park City.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport, a former drag racer before he twice won world championships
in skeleton, disputes the idea the sport is a maniac magnet.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people who try to lump us in with the bungee jumpers," he
said, somewhat indignantly. "We do not have people of that mentality."</TE>
<TE>   Families of U.S. Olympic skeleton racers may not be so easily
persuaded. In Bennington, Vt., the mother of Lincoln DeWitt remembered
trying to sound nonchalant four years ago when her son took up a
crazy-sounding sport. They eased into the conversation, the way parents
do when their children are doing something frightful.</TE>
<TE>   So, Eve Pearce asked her son, the Ivy League economics graduate, do
you wear a helmet?</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, mom, DeWitt said.</TE>
<TE>   Pearce exhaled.</TE>
<TE>   To help her accept his new pastime, DeWitt installed a video on his
mom's computer, showing him sliding. "I just watched it over and over
until I could handle it," Pearce said. "It took some getting used to. It
really did."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, DeWitt said he tried skeleton because it was there: in
his backyard, at the Park City sports facility Utah built in hopes of
securing the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, if I'm going to have to put up with all the hassles of the
Olympics, I'm going to find some way to use this thing," said DeWitt, 34.
"There was this $25-million track in my backyard. It looked like a real
cool toy and I wanted to play on it."</TE>
<TE>   A part-time ski instructor, sometime computer programmer and fanatic
mountain bike racer, DeWittand a friend went 50-50 on used skeleton
equipment. He stared down the track the first time, thinking the sheet
ice made it look like a very steep mirror. For a moment he thought maybe
this was not such a good idea. Then down he went.</TE>
<TE>   "I stepped off the track, looked at my friend and said, 'Do you think
we can still get refunds on our season ski passes?' " DeWitt said. "It
was just so exciting, and it didn't kill me."</TE>
<TE>   As a child in Granville, Ohio, Parsley played soccer and was the
quarterback on her flag football team. She attended college on a
basketball scholarship, then earned two additional degrees in nursing.</TE>
<TE>   One day, friends invited Parsley to Lake Placid, N.Y. She spotted a
skeleton sled and said: What's up with that thing? Soon she was competing
at the World Cup. She is ranked fourth in the world among women.</TE>
<TE>   Parsley, whose pale blue eyes and dark hair make her look something
like Liv Tyler, takes pride in feeling that she is on an athletic
frontier.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not necessarily a pioneer, but you're at a unique time in the
history of the sport," she said. "We're hoping that after thegames, we'll
get a ton of young women coming out. "</TE>
<TE>   Shea had a special incentive to find a winter sport that suited him.
His dad, Jim Shea Sr., competed in Nordic skiing in the 1964 Winter
Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria. Jack Shea, Jimmy's late grandfather, won
two gold medals in speed skating in the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake
Placid--where he is credited with helping to turn that village in upstate
New York into one of the world's great winter sports centers.</TE>
<TE>   Before 91-year-old Jack Shea was killed last month by a drunk driver
in Lake Placid, the three men stood to set a record of their own, as the
first family ever to produce three generations of Olympians.</TE>
<TE>   That distinction has won Jimmy Shea more attention than any other U.S.
skeleton slider. Shea, 33 and No. 5 in the world in overall rankings, was
one of the first sliders to hire an agent to cash in on televised product
endorsements.</TE>
<TE>   Shea's mother put him on skis when he was 2. For a time he skated with
a junior hockey team. Then he tried bobsled, two-man and four-man, but
got bored. In 1995, he took up sliding at Lake Placid.</TE>
<TE>   The image of skeleton as a finesse sport--relying more on the
athlete's body and brain than on equipment--appealed to Shea immediately.
For a kid who always liked to do things like jump off cliffs, the
head-spinning speed of skeleton was a perfect fit.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't do anything that's totally unsafe," Shea said. "Although it's
crazy, what I consider safe."</TE>
<TE>   Days after his grandfather's death, Jimmy and his dad organized the
Shea Foundation in Jack Shea's honor. Its purpose, the younger Shea said,
is to provide training, encouragement and equipment for young athletes.
Skeleton, of course, will be among the opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great outlet for crazy kids to burn off some high
adrenaline, and do it safely," Shea said.</TE>
<TE>   Even among extreme sports, skeleton boasts a maverick image. Sliders
may be fiendishly competitive, but they also think of themselves as
members of a club whose ticket for entry is steel guts. At races,
opposing teams often stay in the same motel. Frequently they eat and
drink together.</TE>
<TE>   And here is the ultimate scary thought about skeleton: Practitioners
of this odd and obscure sport believe it is on the brink of widespread
popularity.</TE>
<TE>   "There are parents all over the world who stick their 8-year-old kids
in tennis camps with the intention of creating tennis monsters,"
Davenport said. "Skeleton isn't to that point. Skeleton will eventually
get to that point."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>Seattle did it first. Los Angeles is doing it next. But this city
of ethnic neighborhoods and exaggerated blue-collar grit--former Chicago
Bears coach Mike Ditka likened the town and the team to "a bunch of guys
named Grabowski"--is where the nation's hottest intellectual trend really
took off.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Richard M. Daley last fall asked every citizen in this city of 3
million to read Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird." The response to One
Book, One Chicago was electric.</LD>
<LD>   The novel about a white lawyer who defends a black man accused of rape
in a Southern town in the 1930s was checked out of public libraries more
than 6,500 times in seven weeks. The paperback made its way up from 250th
to 51st place on Amazon.com's national sales list. The Chicago Bar Assn.
held a mock trial of the courtroom drama depicted in the novel, in
costume. The Chicago Public Library staged a marathon weekend screening
of the movie version, starring Gregory Peck. And Daley, a popular mayor
who is fond of planting flower beds and commissioning art to beautify the
city, asked library officials to pick out a spring book. (They did, Elie
Wiesel's "Night.")</LD>
<TE>   Ever since, communities across the country have embraced the idea of
reading a book together.</TE>
<TE>   "There's definitely been a buzz since Chicago did 'To Kill a
Mockingbird,' " said Jim Quay, executive director of the California
Humanities Council.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by Chicago's example, the council will ask Californians this
summer to read John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath." At more than 600
pages, Steinbeck's classic is hardly a typical beach book. Still,
California officials seem confident the Joad family's story of migrating
from Oklahoma will appeal. "It's a great read," Quay said.</TE>
<TE>   As for Los Angeles, Mayor James K. Hahn plans to ask residents this
spring to read Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451."</TE>
<TE>   In an age of multimedia menus, with 24-hour cable TV and movies on
demand, it might seem anachronistic that the low-tech book is occasioning
this sudden civic interest. But some believe the surge of popularity for
communal reading--not just by cities but also by book clubs and at
bookstore events--is a direct response to the essential loneliness of
modern life, an antidote to the "bowling alone" syndrome coined by
Harvard University's Robert D. Putnam to describe the recent downturn in
civic participation.</TE>
<TE>   "You can go through an entire day without ever interacting with
another human being on anything except the superficial," said Nancy
Pearl, executive director of the Washington Center for the Book that
sparked the city-reads-a-book movement in Seattle in 1996. "There's a
thirst for conversation. People want to talk to people about important
issues."</TE>
<TE>   While Seattle sponsored the first citywide reading (Russell Banks'
"The Sweet Hereafter"), Pearl acknowledges that Chicago put the trend on
the map. So as the phenomenon sparks interest around the world (Hong Kong
and Trinidad and Tobago have requested information about Seattle's
program), it may not be simple to duplicate Chicago's success.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its image as an industrial town of stockyards and beefy
politicians, Chicago has long had an affinity for the written word.</TE>
<TE>   Oprah Winfrey lives here, and any book named as an Oprah's Book Club
choice can add millions of dollars to its sales. The American Library
Assn., the largest and oldest such trade group in the world, has its
headquarters here. And the national craze called Poetry Slam, a cross
between a reading and a pro wrestling match, got its start here.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago has produced its share of famous authors--Carl Sandburg,
Ernest Hemingway, Gwendolyn Brooks. It especially treasures writers with
a fierce bond to the common man, such as Studs Terkel and Mike Royko. It
also delights in readers who defy expectations--the colorful Bill Veeck,
onetime owner of the Chicago White Sox baseball team, who once let a
midget pinch hit in the major leagues and who loved a good book; Harold
Washington, Chicago's first black mayor, who was such a passionate reader
that the city's main public library was named in his honor; and Phil
Jackson, who as coach of the Chicago Bulls gave each player a book to
read every year.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can hang with gas station attendants and university
professors, that's admired," said Miles Harvey, a Chicago writer.</TE>
<TE>   Once the nation's second-largest city (it's now at third, behind New
York and Los Angeles), Chicago has long suffered from a "second city
complex," and Harvey thinks that accounts for its emphasis on
self-learning.</TE>
<TE>   "There's more pride in it here," said Harvey, whose acclaimed "Island
of Lost Maps: A True Story of Cartographic Crime," was researched in the
Newberry Library here, which boasts an impressive map collection. "People
still pride themselves on being regular Joes. They are not seething in
anti-intellectualism. You might go into a bar and talk books with someone
who doesn't look like they read."</TE>
<TE>   Then too, there's the city's phone book of ethnic names. Chicago is
home to the largest number of Polish descendants outside of Warsaw. There
is a sizable and growing Latino population. The black and Jewish
communities are prominent. For many Chicagoans, books are a connection to
home, to the great authors of Ireland or Russia, to the literary
tradition in Poland or Mexico. As a result, the Chicago Public Library
buys books in 100 languages.</TE>
<TE>   Library Commissioner Mary Dempsey, widely credited with the success of
the One Book, One Chicago program, made sure that the selected books
would attract not only the city's many ethnic communities (the library
bought copies in English, Spanish and Polish), but its teenagers as well.</TE>
<TE>   She and other library officials envisioned "a nice little program [in
which] we got strangers talking to strangers on trains and in coffee
shops."</TE>
<TE>   But Daley had grander ambitions. The son of former Mayor Richard J.
Daley, who ruled Chicago as a city boss, he marshaled the resources of
the entire municipal government to ensure the widest possible
participation, part of his wider effort to draw the city's middle class
back from the suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   The city reached out to corporate sponsors. Local grocery chain
Jewel-Osco teamed with regional corporate powerhouse Procter &amp; Gamble and
Borders to offer a $5 rebate on books at Borders for a purchase of three
P&amp;G products. The city published a resource guide for teachers and
distributed 40,000 lapel pins that asked, "Are you reading Mockingbird?"
The library held book discussions, with professional moderators
facilitating the conversations, including 12 for teenagers. High schools
performed theatrical versions of the story. Starbucks, with 60 stores in
the city, provided free coffee and pastries for any customers who
participated in the book discussions, also moderated by library
personnel.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that "Mockingbird" became cool, said Carl Barnett, a
personal trainer and artist-in-residence at Purdue University's Black
Cultural Center in West Lafayette, Ind. "Chicago likes trends. There was
a nice feeling of belonging to something."</TE>
<TE>   The budget was not large--$37,100, including $400 for fans at the bar
association's mock trial--but the effect was. Librarians reported that
patrons confessed to not having read a book for years, until the city's
effort made them feel part of something bigger.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a mythology in Chicago that we are a small town," said Alex
Kotlowitz, author of "There Are No Children Here," a best-selling account
of two boys who grow up poor in Chicago. "This is the most segregated
city in the country, but there's a sense that everybody's connected."</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone in Chicago is buying into the civic pride. Several
cabbies had never heard of the program. And a local essayist and
short-story writer who teaches at Northwestern University, Joseph
Epstein, was downright dismissive. "I have no sense whatever whether it
has mattered a jot," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Others think Chicago's embrace of reading together has less to do with
literary tradition than with more prosaic factors, such as the weather.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell McGrath, a poet and author of the award-winning "Spring Comes
to Chicago," moved to Florida 10 years ago. He thinks Seattle and Chicago
share a gray-sky climate that makes curling up with a book indoors a
natural. "I can't tell you how excited I am when a gray sky comes along.
There's something about the long gray period of time that kind of throws
you back into yourself philosophically."</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the long commutes by train. "Within a very short time
of its founding, Chicago had thousands and thousands of railroad lines,"
said Mary Wyly, associate librarian at the Newberry. "And there's nothing
handier than a book on a train."</TE>
<TE>   Julie Wong, communications director for Hahn, is well aware that Los
Angeles has fewer trains--and sunnier weather. Still, she is hopeful
about the spring book read.</TE>
<TE>   "We may not have trains, but people here spend a lot of time in their
cars and could listen to books on tape," Wong said. "People want to feel
a sense of community, especially in a city like L.A., which is so spread
out."</TE>
<TE>   That may be the biggest dividend for the communities that try reading
a book together and why the books selected differ so much.</TE>
<TE>   Cognizant of its ethnic pluralities, Chicago is picking books that
speak to racial tolerance. (Though Library Commissioner Dempsey suggests
that "next time we may go much lighter.") To bolster the relevance of
Wiesel's account of his Holocaust experience, Dempsey is planning
discussions about ethnic cleansing, with panelists from
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Rwanda and Cambodia. For its part, Seattle tends to
pick more esoteric books that most have not yet read, to educate and
expand audiences.</TE>
<TE>   For libraries, there is the further appeal of regaining the patrons
who slipped away in the 1990s to those coffee-friendly events at Borders
or Barnes &amp; Noble. "We have stopped thinking about libraries as having a
cultural mandate," said Pearl, the Washington Center for the Book
director. "Libraries should be the anchor."</TE>
<TE>   Whether read in libraries or at a Starbucks, on trains or via
audiotape in cars, "To Kill a Mockingbird" gave Chicago one other
unexpected advantage: a shared experience at a time of national grief.
"After Sept. 11, interest galvanized," Dempsey said. "It gave people a
common thing to come together around: a book."</TE>

<HD>Palestinian Bomber Kills 2 Israelis</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Suicide attack in a West Bank settlement injures 30. The
pizzeria blast nearly overlaps with the slaying of an Islamic militant
leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Two Israeli teenagers were killed and 30 others were injured when a
Palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up outside a crowded pizza
restaurant inside a West Bank settlement shortly after the Jewish Sabbath
ended Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Hours later, Israeli attack helicopters fired missiles into
Palestinian Authority buildings in the West Bank city of Nablus in
apparent retaliation for the attack. Palestinians reported that one child
was injured in the predawn raid. The Israeli army said it hit an office
of Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, a police command post
and other structures.</LD>
<LD>   The first suicide bombing attack on a Jewish settlement came at the
end of a week in which the cycle of killing and revenge that has shaped
the conflict here for nearly 17 months intensified, with both sides
escalating fighting that has already claimed well over 1,000 lives.
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, wrapping up a fruitless visit
aimed at goading the antagonists into a cease-fire, told reporters that
the situation is going "from bad to worse."</LD>
<TE>   All day Saturday, the violent incidents came so close together that
they seemed almost to overlap. A leader of the militant Islamic
organization Hamas was killed in the West Bank town of Jenin when a car
he was passing exploded in what Palestinians said was an Israeli
assassination. Palestinian hospital officials said seven bystanders were
slightly injured. Hamas vowed to seek revenge for the killing.</TE>
<TE>   The army issued a statement noting that the dead man, Nazih abu Sebaa,
was "planning to carry out attacks" inside Israel soon and had helped
plan several previous attacks. The slaying came as Israeli media reported
that military intelligence had told the government that targeted killings
increase--rather than thwart--attacks on Israelis. Israel has carried out
dozens such killings during the insurgency, characterizing them as acts
of self-defense.</TE>
<TE>Israeli Troops Raid Refugee Camp</TE>
<TE>   In another action, Israeli troops swept into the central Gaza Strip
refugee camp of Bureij, taking over a regional Palestinian security
compound, then coming under what the army described as "massive fire"
from gunmen, which triggered an hours-long battle. Three Palestinians,
two of them teenagers, were killed and 11 injured during the clash.
Israeli troops also bulldozed hundreds of citrus and other trees along a
nearby road where Palestinians killed three soldiers Thursday by blowing
up their tank.</TE>
<TE>   Late Saturday, the army said a homemade Kassam-1 rocket developed by
Hamas fell inside an army base in northern Gaza, damaging a building but
causing no injuries. It was the second Kassam rocket to be fired by
Palestinians on Saturday. The first, the longer-range Kassam-2, landed in
a kibbutz inside Israel's pre-1967 borders. The rockets' range enables
them to strike cities inside Israel, and the government has warned that
it will respond forcefully to their use.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians fired the Kassam-2 rocket, which landed in the Negev
desert, for the first time last week. Afterward, the Israeli army
launched its broadest incursion into the Gaza Strip since September 2000,
killing five Palestinians in an 18-hour operation that was widely
condemned here.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the suicide attack on the Karnei Shomron settlement, near
the West Bank Palestinian town of Kalkilya, came as hundreds of Jewish
teenagers from the community and surrounding settlements were congregated
at a pizza parlor and coffee shop after the Sabbath ended.</TE>
<TE>   There have been two shooting attacks inside Jewish settlements in the
last 17 months.</TE>
<TE>   The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a leftist faction
of the Palestine Liberation Organization, claimed responsibility for the
suicide attack in a statement to Al Jazeera, a pan-Arab satellite
television station. The group said the bomber came from Kalkilya.</TE>
<TE>   The group said the attack was in response to Israeli actions, and it
also warned Arafat to stop arresting senior PFLP leaders. Arafat has made
some arrests since the group claimed responsibility for the October
slaying of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi.</TE>
<TE>   A pizza deliveryman identified only as Amnon said on Israel Television
that he had just returned from making a delivery when "I heard a loud
boom and then saw nails flying all over, and everything crashed down to
the floor."</TE>
<TE>   The bomber had detonated a device packed with nails inside the
restaurant. Nine people reportedly were injured by shrapnel.</TE>
<TE>   Eli Kinach, a resident of the settlement, said his teenage daughter,
Vered, was at the pizzeria when the attack occurred. When he heard the
explosion, Kinach said, he rushed to the mall.</TE>
<TE>   "When I arrived at the pizzeria, all I saw was total destruction,"
Kinach told Israel Television. "Everything was dark. Injured people were
scattered in a radius of about [10 feet]. . . . I walked among all the
injured until, finally, I found my daughter, lightly injured. I joined
her in the ambulance."</TE>
<TE>'Again We See a Massacre'</TE>
<TE>   Security forces evacuated the settlement as they searched for more
bombs.</TE>
<TE>   "Again we see a massacre," said Hoshaya Harari, a medic who tended the
injured. "Again, a mass killing. All that people wanted was to go out and
have a good time, and now the place is wrecked and burned down--the
terrorists want to kill us everywhere, and they reached us here tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, the army said that a sergeant was shot dead Friday
night when gunmen ambushed soldiers at a roadblock outside the West Bank
village of Surda. The attackers apparently approached the roadblock on
foot, and one of them shot Sgt. Lee Nahman Akunis, 20, at point-blank
range while another hit a second soldier and stole his gun. The gunmen
escaped. A militia of Arafat's Fatah faction claimed responsibility for
the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Akunis was the fifth Israeli soldier to die in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip since Thursday, when militants blew up an Israeli tank, killing
three of its crew. On Friday, a lieutenant colonel who commanded an elite
undercover unit died when a wall collapsed on him during a
search-and-arrest operation in a West Bank village.</TE>
<TE>   "They are trying to provoke us," Arye Mekel, a senior Israeli Foreign
Ministry official, said in a telephone interview. "Obviously, there is an
escalation and a deterioration. It seems to be a strategy to continue
with these attacks in order to pressure Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Although various factions claimed responsibility for Saturday's
attacks, Mekel blamed Arafat for allegedly "giving a green light" for
such assaults to escalate.</TE>
<TE>   "We hardly know anymore who to blame. We hardly pay any attention,"
Mekel said.</TE>
<TE>   And in Gaza, a spokesman for the Popular Resistance Committees, an
umbrella organization of militants from several factions--which is the
group that claimed responsibility for taking out the Israeli tank--warned
that attacks will intensify.</TE>
<TE>   "The kind of attacks we have seen in the last days are a result of the
desperate need to stop the escalating and continuous Zionist aggression
against the Palestinian land and the Palestinian people," Mohammed Baba
said in a telephone interview. "Whatever means we can find to stop this
aggression we will use."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli retaliation, Baba said, "will not force the Palestinians to
surrender. It will cause us to bring as much force as we can to respond."</TE>
<TE>   On the Israeli side, opposition leader Yossi Sarid, leader of the
left-wing Meretz Party, said on Israel Radio that the Israeli occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip is "the factory of terrorism and
terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   "Terrorism, in turn, strengthens the hand of the [Israeli]
nationalists, such as [Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon," Sarid said, "and
this is how the vicious cycle of blood and horror is created, the cycle
that has to be broken."</TE>

<HD>Ice Sculpting Comes In From the Cold in Russia</HD>
<DH>Europe: The art is regaining popularity after having been neglected
during the Soviet years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Russia
</DL>
<LD>As winter's dim sun rose over this city's golden towers and
palaces, tens of thousands of people gathered on the banks of the
half-frozen Neva River, braving the chilly wind whipping in from the Gulf
of Finland.</LD>
<LD>   Drawing the crowd was a collection of ice sculptures, blue and
shimmering, that slowly melted under the brunt of an unusual February
thaw. Although transitory, the show marked something more permanent:
Russians' rediscovery of the art of ice carving, which is gaining in
popularity each winter.</LD>
<LD>   There is something magical about sculpting in ice, like cutting
transparency and light itself, said Alexander Ignatyev, a carver from
Yakutia, a region of Siberia that has produced some of Russia's best
sculptors.</LD>
<TE>   Ice carving in Russia goes back at least 260 years, said Viktor
Chernyshev, president of the Russian Assn. of Ice, Snow and Sand
Sculptors. Around 1740, Empress Anna ordered an ice palace built along
the Neva, complete with a four-poster bed made of ice. (She had a
sadistic streak too: To humiliate a nobleman who displeased her, she
ordered him to marry a homely peasant and, after a procession led by farm
animals, to consummate the marriage in the ice palace.)</TE>
<TE>   Trained as an engineer, Chernyshev took up ice sculpting 15 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing more fascinating [than] an ice sculpture for me. An
ice sculpture has a very strong energy--it does not live long, and just
like all transitory things, it tries to share its energy with the world
it lives in," he said. "In that respect, ice is like fire: It is very
short-lived, and it is so beautiful, one can hardly take his eyes off
it."</TE>
<TE>   More than 50,000 people streamed down to the banks of the Neva this
month for the city's first International Ice Sculpting Festival. A total
of 48 artists in 16 teams took part, creating confections ranging from a
small but elegant mermaid to a replica of the Leaning Tower of Pisa 13
feet high.</TE>
<TE>   Russia has about 1,000 ice sculptors, Chernyshev said, and a majority
of the nation's northern cities hold such exhibitions every year. But ice
sculpting has seen a relatively recent resurgence; for whatever reason,
it was not encouraged in Soviet times.</TE>
<TE>   "The [Communist] Party had lots of other things in its hands and never
found the time to pay attention to ice and snow sculpture," Chernyshev
said. "No one must have thought of it before Boris Yeltsin."</TE>
<TE>   Before Yeltsin became Russia's president in 1991, he was the Communist
Party leader in the Siberian city of Sverdlovsk, where he encountered ice
sculpting. In 1986, when he had become party boss in Moscow, he ordered
that snow sculptures be built for the New Year's holiday all around the
capital. But unlike sculptors in Sverdlovsk, now Yekaterinburg, which had
a hard freeze and generally clean snow, Muscovites used gray, dirty, damp
snow scraped off the streets. City workers would paint it white so that
it looked right.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids who had the misfortune to slide down the ice hill made in the
shape of a dragon in Gorky Park would have to go to the director's
office, where a jar of acetone was kept to get the white paint off their
clothes," Chernyshev recalled with a laugh. "But as all this was new to
Moscow, no one complained."</TE>
<TE>   Chernyshev became fascinated with ice sculpting when he read an
article about it in a then hard-to-get magazine called Photos of Japan.
There were four subscriptions in Moscow, and he had one of them.</TE>
<TE>   "I can still recall those photos--it was so picturesque," he said.
"That was it for me and ice sculpture, and there has been no stopping me
since."</TE>
<TE>   Only since Russians became more free to travel in the 1990s have
enthusiasts like Chernyshev been able to go abroad to learn the
techniques of ice sculpting and visit famous ice festivals in Sapporo,
Japan, and Fairbanks, Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   He says each piece is unique, and he recalls with pleasure visiting an
ice festival in Zurich, Switzerland, for three years in a row and each
time seeing replications of the same work by Auguste Rodin. "The first
time, I was impressed. The second time, I was enraptured. And the third
time, I was moved. It was great," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Ice is like diamond--it sparkles and scintillates and appears
different depending on the angle of the light," he said. "The color
spectrum of ordinary ice is truly amazing, especially if it is
illuminated in the dark."</TE>
<TE>   There are vistas for Russia to conquer in ice, Chernyshev said.</TE>
<TE>   "We Russians have always been explaining that Russia is a northern
country and that it's the source of many of our problems," he said. "But
if Russia is a cold and snowy country, with an abundance of ice, then we
should put it to good use. Let's try to lead. We have a great potential
to make Russia No. 1 in the world as far as ice sculpture goes."</TE>
<TE>   As it happens, some of the best Russian carvers are from Yakutia, part
of the permafrost belt in Siberia, where many also specialize in making
figurines from the tusks of ancient mammoths that have been preserved in
the frozen tundra.</TE>
<TE>   "In Yakutia, we say it is cold three months of the year and the rest
of the time very cold," a carver on the Yakutia team in St. Petersburg
joked.</TE>
<TE>   The team took five days to create a sphinx reached by an ice bridge.
It required about 400 blocks of ice, which had been cut from a lake. Each
block was about the size of a small desktop: 3 feet long, 1 1/2 feet wide
and 10 inches thick, weighing about 150 pounds. The team's tools included
electric grinders and saws, chisels with high-quality steel tips,
scrapers and a hair dryer.</TE>
<TE>   The Yakutia carvers won third prize for their entry.</TE>
<TE>   Carvers such as Ignatyev say sculpting in ice is extraordinarily
difficult because of its transparency--often a piece is shaped more by
feel than by sight. Only those who already have some skill in stone or
wood sculpting will be successful, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "Ice is a medium one can cut and carve very quickly, but it does not
forgive mistake," said Alexander Zaborev of the Yakutia team. "One
mistake, and it is a spoiled work."</TE>
<TE>   "The texture of ivory is smooth and hard, and it takes a long time to
make a figurine--maybe years," said team leader Piotr Markov, 54. "With
ice it is really miraculous. You have something in your head, and you can
realize it in an hour or in three or four days."</TE>
<TE>   But the ice often melts just as quickly. The sculptors say they have
learned to take the disintegration of their masterpieces in stride.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't really regret that the sculpture is gone, because we keep a
photo of it and the people go away with the awareness that it is never to
happen again in that same way," Zaborev said.</TE>
<TE>   "They will hold them in their hearts and remember," Ignatyev said,
"and that makes us happy."</TE>

<LD>Up to 200 people have been killed in ethnic clashes in northeastern
Congo in the last two days, tribal sources said.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for the Hema community in Bukavu said that an attack
Friday by Lendu militiamen on the Hema village of Kparnganza, about 15
miles north of the town of Bunia, had left 200 people dead.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the same business that has been going on for the past three
years," Jean-Baptiste Dhetchuvi said. Fighting between the Lendu and Hema
communities in Congo has killed thousands of people in recent years in a
conflict over land and natural resources.</LD>

<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>The government forced Europe's top election observer to leave the
country Saturday, deepening a dispute with the European Union that
threatens to further isolate the southern African country.</LD>
<LD>   Zimbabwe had refused to recognize Pierre Schori, Sweden's ambassador
to the United Nations, as head of the 150-member European observer
mission for March 9-10 presidential elections, in which President Robert
Mugabe faces the biggest challenge yet to his 22-year hold on power.</LD>
<LD>   Zimbabwean officials only granted Schori a two-week tourist visa when
he entered the country Feb. 10. Schori said immigration officials
canceled his visa as of midnight Saturday after "the government had
decided that I must leave today."</LD>
<TE>   He said he had been told Friday that he could stay in Zimbabwe as a
tourist provided that he refrained from making any public statements, a
demand repeated by a government official in published comments Saturday.</TE>

<DL>TABIAWAN, Philippines
</DL>
<LD>Grenade blasts ripped through a market and a movie theater in the
southern Philippines on Saturday, killing at least five people as more
U.S. troops arrived under tight security to join a growing American force
on a new front in the campaign against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   One grenade exploded at dawn near a crowded market on Jolo, an island
about 600 miles south of Manila, authorities said. At least five people
were killed and more than 40 people were injured.</LD>
<LD>   Hours later, a grenade exploded at a movie theater about 75 miles away
in downtown Zamboanga, the region's largest city, injuring at least five
people watching "The Lord of the Rings."</LD>
<TE>   The theater is about four miles from the Philippine military's
Southern Command headquarters, where the U.S. personnel are staying.</TE>
<TE>   Philippine officials said they suspected the Abu Sayyaf, a Muslim
rebel group U.S. officials say has been linked with Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   The 30 to 40 U.S. Special Forces troops who arrived Saturday are
joining 250 Americans already in Zamboanga for a six-month exercise
focusing on Basilan, an island about 20 miles south of Zamboanga where
the guerrillas have been holding an American missionary couple captive
for months. The U.S. contingent is to grow to 660.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if they fear for their safety, a U.S. major, who asked to be
identified only as Sam, said, "Honestly, no. We know that there is a risk
and that's part of the job."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo said police arrested the
suspected leader and 10 other members of the Pentagon Gang, a group that
U.S. officials say has terrorist ties and that has been blamed for
kidnapping wealthy Filipinos and foreigners.</TE>

<HD>Egypt's Dinosaur Economy Lumbers On With Aid</HD>
<DH>Africa: The nation lacks adequate investment and a dynamic private
sector. But its geopolitical value ensures a constant flow of
international assistance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORT SAID, Egypt
</DL>
<LD>Mohammed Abdu needs only $65 a month to cover his expenses. But
these days, even that seems out of reach. The government never came
through with the job it promises every college graduate, and it's about
to strip away the sole source of income he managed to find: hawking cheap
imported clothing on the street.</LD>
<LD>   There are lots of people like Abdu in this "duty-free" city on the
Suez Canal. Hundreds of thousands, in fact. And after it became clear
this year that their town was about to lose the special economic status
it's enjoyed for more than 25 years--and with it a lucrative trade in
imports--a riot broke out. Anger coursed through the streets as people
hurled stones, lighted fires and chanted anti-government slogans.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone here feels choked," said Abdu, 30, who witnessed the fray.
"We have no confidence in this country. It is every young man's dream to
emigrate."</LD>
<TE>   The violence was a shock to a nation that prides itself on stability
and gives authorities unrestrained power to maintain that stability.
Squads of riot police did restore order, dragging more than 100
demonstrators off to jail. But there is little chance the police can calm
an entire population angered by rising prices, soaring unemployment and a
growing belief that the government is neither in control nor telling them
the truth.</TE>
<TE>   Egypt's economy is a faltering, state-managed dinosaur. After a decade
of ostensible liberalization, the government has failed to attract
adequate investment, keep local money working at home or build a dynamic
private sector. Instead, the country has survived--and at times
prospered--by capitalizing on its strategic importance to the West,
burning through about $50 billion in aid and loans since making peace
with Israel a quarter of a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   And once again, Egypt is poised to cash in on its geopolitical value.
At a recent donors conference, wealthy Western nations eager to ensure
stability in the Arab world's most populous country--especially during
the U.S.-led war on terrorism--pledged an additional $10 billion in loans
and aid over the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   "When we were doing well, it was not because we had a solid economy,"
said Samiha Fawzy, deputy director of the Egyptian Center for Economic
Studies, a Cairo-based think tank. "It was always dependent on external
sources."</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian authorities insist that although the economy is stressed, it
remains "robust." People who talk of their personal experiences, however,
have trouble seeing the upside. Unemployment is unofficially estimated at
about 20%. The value of savings is depreciating as the currency declines
on the black market. The prices of staples have increased as the
government tries to back away from subsidizing commodities. The average
income is about $1,300 a year, and more than half the population lives
near or below the poverty line.</TE>
<TE>   "I am dependent solely on my family," said Ahmed Farghaly, 24, a
college-educated accountant who can't find work in Cairo. "What worries
me is finding an opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   The nation's underlying weakness was revealed for all to see after the
Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. Egypt was already in the throes of
a two-year recession, and its foreign currency reserves were depleted,
when the attacks bit into three of its most vital sources of income:
tourism, remittances from abroad and Suez Canal revenues.</TE>
<TE>   With annual imports in recent years totaling about $17 billion and
exports about $6 billion, Egypt has a huge trade imbalance. It
desperately needs hard currency to pay for the imports and shore up the
value of its own currency. But tourism alone, which has brought in as
much as $4 billion a year, dropped by about 50% in the months after the
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "After Sept. 11, our problems became very serious," Fawzy said.</TE>
<TE>Currency Concerns</TE>
<TE>   The most pressing problem was the currency. With the Egyptian pound
trading at six to the dollar on the black market, or 29% above the
official rate, the government stepped in early this year with its
strong-arm style of economic management. It arrested unlicensed money
changers and slapped high tariffs on imports. The strategy worked for a
time. But it also created an even greater demand for dollars, undermined
public confidence in the monetary system and made it harder for small
businesses to function. Recently, the black market price was back to 5.9
pounds to the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   "All they did was make it difficult and dangerous to change money,"
said a commodities exporter who spoke on the condition that he not be
identified. He said buying and selling dollars have become a
cloak-and-dagger enterprise. "We used to go to the shop and change money.
Now we pick them [traders] up in a car, drive a kilometer away and trade
packages. It is as if we are getting drugs."</TE>
<TE>   A Western diplomat based in Cairo, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the government often makes things worse.</TE>
<TE>   "They have some real problems they have to deal with, but it is not a
crisis," the diplomat said. "The main problem is the way the government
acts. In some ways, the government magnifies the problem with some of its
actions. . . . Egyptians want economic reform, but they don't want there
to be any pain with it. They want things to change, but they want them to
stay the same."</TE>
<TE>   Many of Egypt's economic troubles have converged in Port Said, a city
of about 600,000.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s, Egypt imposed a ban on all textile imports as a way of
supporting a fledgling textile industry of its own. The ban helped
protect the jobs of state workers who did everything from harvesting
cotton to selling shirts.</TE>
<TE>   But Port Said, whose economy was devastated by the 1967 Middle East
War with Israel, had neither cotton farms nor shirt factories. So
authorities granted the city an exclusive status enabling it to import
textiles tax-free. The idea was to create a lucrative revolving door:
Ready-to-wear clothing could be manufactured from imported material and
then exported. Instead, the city became the locus of a thriving smuggling
trade, where tax-free goods were sold at a tremendous profit.</TE>
<TE>   "Port Said has become a nickname for smuggling," said Badri Farghaly,
a leftist lawmaker who represents the city in parliament. "That is what
the government has labeled it."</TE>
<TE>City of Smugglers</TE>
<TE>   For decades, the city flourished. The streets are lined with stores
selling Adidases and Levi's, Reeboks and Wranglers. The smuggling worked
several ways. Cairo residents, for example, would make the 2 1/2-hour
drive to Port Said, buy clothing, put it all on, then drive out past the
checkpoints ringing the city. Factories, according to businesspeople,
would contract to produce 1,000 shirts with imported material but would
make 1,200--and sell the surplus in other cities.</TE>
<TE>   The Port Said operations, however, undermined national efforts to
protect domestic industry by keeping out imports, and they used up hard
currency. With the economy sagging, authorities looked for a way to crack
down.</TE>
<TE>   They found the answer in the World Trade Organization. As a WTO
member, Egypt is obliged to lift its ban on clothing imports by 2005.
President Hosni Mubarak's strategy was to lift the ban this year and then
slap hefty import duties on garments, such as 1,000 pounds per men's suit
and 1,400 pounds on women's formal wear. That in effect kept the import
ban in place.</TE>
<TE>   The adverse results are readily apparent here. Retail clerks have time
to close for lunch and the five-times-a-day Muslim prayers because there
are so few customers. Store owners complain that they are going to be
forced to sell Egyptian products because imports will be too expensive,
and shopkeepers call that troublesome because coddled domestic industries
produce low-quality goods that are relatively expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers outside Port Said, however, are happy. High taxes on
imported clothing, including leather goods, will allow the owner of a
small tannery to continue selling high-quality products abroad and
reserving his low-grade output for sale at home.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very good thing for us, and we encourage putting high taxes
on imports," said the factory owner, who would speak only without
attribution. "Soon they will put taxes on shoe imports as well, and that
will be a great thing. This will help to refresh the leather industry and
create jobs in Egypt."</TE>
<TE>   This is not how world lenders want Egypt to be creating jobs. But
given the backdrop of political turmoil in the region, no one is
objecting too strenuously. This month, Egypt hosted a conference at the
Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheik for 37 donor nations and international
financial groups. The government said it needed about $2.5 million in
monetary aid to ease its immediate woes. President Mubarak acknowledged
some of the country's fiscal problems but blamed them mostly on outside
factors and asked for patience.</TE>
<TE>   "We should understand that economic reforms take time," Mubarak told
the conferees. "You cannot press a button to reform the economy."</TE>
<TE>   Though the donors insisted that Egypt move ahead with plans to open up
the economy--for example, by privatizing the banking sector--there was
never any doubt that Egypt would walk away with enough cash to stabilize
itself, at least in the short run. And although officials say that some
small banks have been privatized, the four that control almost 80% of
Egypt's wealth remain in government hands.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, Egypt found that its most valuable commodity is not its
cotton but its politics.</TE>
<TE>   "Egypt was given all this money for purely political reasons," said
Emad Shahin, a political science professor at the American University in
Cairo. "It's a strategic decision. Egypt is a strategic country."</TE>

<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>After aiming for the top and failing, investigators searching for
kidnapped Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl have turned their
attention away from the confessed mastermind of the abduction to a
lower-level militant who allegedly sent Pearl off to the fake meeting
that led to his disappearance.</LD>
<LD>   But investigators who just days ago promised rapid developments in the
case were not even in accord Saturday about the latest suspect's
name--though they agreed that he was not at home when they raided his
family's house.</LD>
<LD>   The new suspect probably is named Amjad Hussain Farooqi, but he has
also been identified as Mansour Hussain and Haider Ali Farooqi, according
to several police sources.</LD>
<TE>   What investigators could agree on was that their latest quarry
identified himself to Pearl as Imtiaz Siddiqi.</TE>
<TE>   The man known as Siddiqi, they say, telephoned the correspondent
within an hour before his disappearance Jan. 23 and sent him off to a
tryst at a neighborhood restaurant in this port city with the promise
that he would get a long-sought interview with a radical Islamic cleric.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the 38-year-old South Asia bureau chief for the Journal went
missing, and since two e-mail messages from his kidnappers were sent out
three weeks ago, no one has come forward with information about his fate.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators continued Saturday to interrogate Ahmad Omar Saeed
Sheikh, the apparent ringleader of the kidnapping plot, in whom they had
placed high hopes of ending the case after his arrest was announced
Tuesday. It was still uncertain Saturday whether he actually was arrested
last week or had been in custody earlier. He said in court that he was in
custody by Feb. 5, which was confirmed by a top government source but
denied by local investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh has offered no concrete leads. He shocked authorities Thursday
by tearing off a hood placed over his head and blurting to a judge that
"as far as I understand, he [Pearl] is dead." He also confessed to the
kidnapping in open court and said he did not want to defend himself
against any charges.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said that Sheikh was lying and that, until convinced
otherwise, they were operating under the assumption that Pearl was alive.
The reporter's wife, Mariane, who is six months pregnant with the
couple's first child, also was holding on to that belief.</TE>
<TE>   Some investigation sources say the new focus of the hunt--Farooqi--may
have been one of the hijackers of an Indian Airlines jet who demanded and
won Sheikh's release from an Indian prison in 1999. But a police source
dismissed that theory Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, police continued to search for a third man behind e-mails
sent to Pearl as part of an elaborate setup to kidnap him. That man, who
identified himself as "Arif," is believed to be Mohammed Hashim Qadeer.
When investigators showed up at his family's house two weeks ago,
relatives were sitting in mourning for Qadeer--with no body. They told
police that he had died only days earlier in Afghanistan, but
investigators were skeptical and have continued their hunt for him.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as Thursday, investigators promised an impending break in
the case. On Saturday, they appeared to be backing away from that
promise.</TE>

<HD>Slaying of Afghan Minister Shakes Faith in Government</HD>
<DH>Security: Scandal widens as more arrests are made. Karzai, at
funeral, calls it 'a reminder of past tragedies.'</DH>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>A slain Cabinet minister was buried on a muddy hillside here
Saturday, the fog that shrouded his simple wooden casket echoing the
cloud of suspicion and intrigue that surrounds his death and threatens to
envelope Afghanistan's fragile peace and struggling government.</LD>
<LD>   The government of interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai has deemed
security its most immediate priority. Yet, disturbingly, the top security
officials in the key ministries--interior, defense and justice--have been
named as suspects in the airport killing Thursday of Air Transportation
and Tourism Minister Abdul Rahman.</LD>
<LD>   Among them are two airport security directors, named as conspirators
by Karzai one day after a mob of Muslim pilgrims had been implicated.</LD>
<TE>   If a Cabinet member can be stabbed to death in the very airport that
is under his ministry's control, with hundreds of people milling around
to witness it, no government official is safe, observers fear.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Rahman's killing, few government ministers had dared bring
their families back to Kabul, the Afghan capital patrolled by thousands
of international peacekeepers. Rahman certainly had not.</TE>
<TE>   Six British peacekeepers in the capital returned fire after they were
fired upon Saturday, their commander said, and a person later was found
dead nearby. A group of Afghan civilians said a man was killed when they
were shot at near a peacekeepers' post, but it was not clear whether the
incidents, or even the posts, were the same.</TE>
<TE>   At least four of the six suspects Karzai named are Tajiks from the
Panjshir Valley, who make up the most powerful arm of the Northern
Alliance that helped defeat the Taliban. Panjshir natives run the key
security agencies, a source of resentment for some ethnic Pushtuns in
Karzai's Cabinet who reportedly have alleged that the Panjshir officials
are running a shadow government. Karzai is a Pushtun, the country's
dominant ethnic group, and has said the slaying was the culmination of a
long-running political feud.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai's delicate position could be read in the lineup of mourners at
Rahman's funeral on a hillside left slick by an all-day rain. The prime
minister was flanked by the leaders of the ministries whose top security
officers have been implicated in Rahman's death: Interior Minister Younis
Qanooni and Defense Minister Mohammed Qassim Fahim, both Tajiks.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike a U.S. president, Karzai did not name his Cabinet. His interim
government was the result of an agreement reached in Germany. Now that
Cabinet lies at the heart of his biggest crisis since he took office Dec.
22.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai has struggled to root out rogue elements from the government
while trying to prevent the kind of bloodletting and factionalism that
left thousands dead and the country in ruins in the early 1990s, when the
Northern Alliance was in power.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai told the mourners Saturday that Rahman's killing "was a
reminder of past tragedies."</TE>
<TE>   Particularly significant was the arrest of Gen. Deen Mohammad Joorat,
the No. 3 official at the Interior Ministry, who has been accused of
arresting and beating political opponents. Mohammed Faqir and Abdul
Rahim, both airport security directors who work for the Interior
Ministry, also were arrested in connection with Rahman's killing.</TE>
<TE>   Three other security officials--Panjshir natives from the defense,
interior and justice ministries--are being sought in Saudi Arabia. They
allegedly fled Afghanistan on a chartered flight of pilgrims headed for
the annual hajj to the holy city of Mecca.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal widened Saturday, with more arrests made, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Omar Samad said, and more expected. There were unconfirmed
reports, denied by Samad, that many others had been arrested for plotting
a coup.</TE>
<TE>   It was freezing and pitch black at the decrepit Kabul airport when
Rahman was stabbed to death Thursday evening. With no electricity, there
was not a single light on the runway or in the terminal building. A crowd
of thinly clad Muslim pilgrims, bound for the holiest event of their
lives and enraged at 48-hour flight delays that had kept them grounded,
had been blocking the path of the India-bound plane carrying Rahman. They
threatened to set it ablaze.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, the minister wound up on the ground and ended up dead. Though
his death was initially attributed to a beating at the hands of the angry
pilgrims, Rahman actually had been stabbed to death, relatives said
Saturday at his funeral.</TE>
<TE>   The plot seems right out of a novel, with elements of murder, shifting
loyalties and misdirection. Adding to the intrigue, in previous
governments, the Air Transportation and Tourism Ministry controlled a
potentially lucrative source of cash from the smuggling of gemstones and
heroin on planes, making it a sought-after post.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the inexplicable chain of events, Karzai was at the airport
just an hour before Rahman's killing.</TE>
<TE>   Samad said Karzai, arriving on a flight from the eastern city of
Jalalabad, was confronted by the angry pilgrims and promised that their
chartered flights to Mecca would leave soon.</TE>
<TE>   Rahman planned to continue on from New Delhi to Montreal to attend a
meeting on airport security.</TE>
<TE>   Also aboard Rahman's plane were 21 Foreign Ministry employees, headed
to India for educational training, Samad said. As the crowd milled around
on the runway, the plane's engines were turned off and the passengers
huddled in the back, the midafternoon daylight gradually fading into
darkness.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime after 6 p.m., Rahman finally answered the pilgrims' appeal to
address them and headed to the front of the plane, Samad said. Whatever
happened to the minister took place either in the front of the plane or
outside it, Samad said, but his body ended up on the ground. He was taken
to a military hospital, where he died.</TE>
<TE>   Rahman, 49, a doctor and a Tajik, although not from the Panjshir area,
had once been a favorite of the late Ahmed Shah Masoud, who commanded the
core of the Northern Alliance movement. In the early 1990s, Rahman served
his first term as the air transportation and tourism minister in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   But he and Masoud had a falling out, and he shifted his allegiances to
the former king, Mohammad Zaher Shah, who lives in exile in Rome. Three
years ago, Rahman moved with his family to India.</TE>
<TE>   Female employees at the Air Transportation and Tourism Ministry,
draped in black shawls, came in a separate bus from the male workers to
pay their respects at the two-story concrete house where Rahman had lived

<HD>Afghans' Hajj Prospects Look Grim</HD>
<DH>Religion: Thousands of Muslims are stranded in Kandahar as time
begins to run out for this year's pilgrimage to Mecca.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Lala Khan sold off about 20 acres of his farm to make most of the
money for his holy pilgrimage to Mecca. The rest he borrowed from a
relative. The only thing stopping him now, he says, is the United States.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't go because the United States took our airport," Khan said
Saturday as he stood among hundreds of people milling about outside the
local office where thousands hoping to make the pilgrimage, or hajj, had
expected to receive passports and plane tickets days ago.</LD>
<LD>   "So now it's the United States' responsibility to find the means for
us to make the hajj," he said.</LD>
<TE>   About 20,000 would-be pilgrims are stranded in Afghanistan, more than
5,000 of them in the southern regional capital of Kandahar. They have
little or no chance of reaching their goal: Most received visas only a
day or so ago. The national airline has only three passenger jets. And
the hajj ends soon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very big problem," said Ahmed Karzai, brother of interim Prime
Minister Hamid Karzai. "We have no planes, and we have 20,000 people."</TE>
<TE>   Frustration among pilgrims who have congregated in at least three
major cities--Kandahar, Herat and the capital, Kabul--has been running
high. A mob of angry pilgrims was initially blamed for an attack that
killed the aviation and tourism minister in Kabul--an explanation that
was plausible under the circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   For those in Kandahar, there is an added frustration: The United
States has occupied their only airport and turned it into a highly
fortified military base.</TE>
<TE>   The interim Afghan government blames Saudi bureaucracy and
Afghanistan's lawless reputation for delayed visas and scuttled charter
flights. The U.S. blames an inadequate and bomb-damaged airfield.</TE>
<TE>   But those explanations carry little weight with the crowds of pilgrims
here, who are sure the fault falls squarely on America.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very angry because when the Americans were not here, we were
able to go easily," said Mohammed Yaqob, a 45-year-old livestock trader
from Helmand province. "Now that the Americans are here they have blocked
our airport."</TE>
<TE>   Making the hajj is one of the pillars of Islam, requiring believers
with the physical and financial means to travel once in their lives to
the holy city of Mecca and walk in the footsteps of the prophet Muhammad.</TE>
<TE>   The hopeful pilgrims in Kandahar, many of whom have been scrimping for
years to save the $1,500 needed for the trip, began arriving from
neighboring provinces three weeks ago to pay their way, apply for a visa
and wait for a flight. They have established a tent city outside the hajj
office, where they while the day away drinking tea and waiting for news
from inside.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, the news has been bad. No foreign companies were
willing to provide charter planes for the Afghan pilgrims. The national
carrier, Ariana Airlines, once had eight airplanes, but five of them were
destroyed by U.S. bombing. Then Saudi Arabia refused visas to about half
the 5,214 applicants from Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudis relented Friday, but it was already too late. Pilgrims from
Kandahar did not have enough time to travel to Kabul, from where Ariana's
few aircraft were departing, and reach Mecca before the hajj ends.
Besides, many said, they feared mistreatment by northern Afghans, many of
whom fought for years against the Taliban-dominated south.</TE>
<TE>   To the popular mind, at least in Kandahar, all would have been well if
only the United States had allowed them to catch flights at the former
city airport.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans caused this problem for us," said Abdul Habib, a
35-year-old farmer from the town of Now Zad in Helmand province. "We are
very unhappy."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Ralph Mills said he was unaware
of any formal request to the U.S. military to grant access to the
Kandahar airport for civilian flights to Mecca. But he said that any such
request would probably have been turned down for two reasons: The runway
is unsuitable for heavy passenger jets, and permitting hundreds of
pilgrims on the base would have created an untenable security risk.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the state bank branch in Kandahar began refunding
pilgrims' money. Hundreds gathered outside the bank, banging on the metal
gate. Inside, pilgrims crowded bank clerks who counted out short stacks
of $100 bills.</TE>
<TE>   Branch director Faisal Ahmad said he had enough staff to give refunds
to about 1,000 pilgrims Saturday. He wasn't sure how many days it would
take to pay back the rest.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the money in our bank," he said. "We put it in a safe, and
now we'll take it out and give it all back."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Ahmad blamed the local government for collecting money
for the hajj without first organizing charters and visas and runway
rights.</TE>
<TE>   "It was wishful thinking on our part," acknowledged engineer Mohammed
Yusef Pushtoon, a top aide to Kandahar Gov. Gul Agha Shirzai. Pushtoon
said the situation has given rise to unfortunate allegations that the
interim government is anti-Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm unhappy this situation was not handled properly in Kabul," he
said. "They should have given much more attention to it."</TE>
<TE>   Khan, the farmer, agreed. This is the second year in a row that he has
traveled to Kandahar from his home province of Helmand to attempt the
hajj. He is 55 now--an old man in Afghanistan--and he's beginning to fear
that he will soon become too feeble to make the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to honor my God and seek the healing of Islam," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His comrade, livestock trader Yaqob, said the United States and the
United Nations should have anticipated the problem and found ways to
provide transportation. Saturday, he was putting off a trip to the bank,
waiting outside the hajj office's gates for the unlikely news that a
plane would depart.</TE>
<TE>   "I still have hope," he said. "Even if there's only 30 minutes left,
we will go."</TE>

<HD>Real Security Is Elusive, New Afghan Police Force Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>This past week, tribal leaders launched the first multi-faction
police squad here, no small feat in the ethnically combustible city.</LD>
<LD>   The force's top mission is to disarm thousands of soldiers who rushed
into Mazar-i-Sharif after the Taliban fell, and the new officers have
devised a system of confiscating guns at city limits and handing out
little cards in return, like coat checkers.</LD>
<LD>   But security is still spotty.</LD>
<TE>   Not only do the crowded, muddy streets bristle with grenade launchers
and 50-caliber machine guns, but several local aid workers were attacked
during the week.</TE>
<TE>   No foreigners are known to have been hurt, but a local Save the
Children driver was beaten and robbed, a UNICEF official was shot, and
the head of Focus Humanitarian Assistance, a British group, was kidnapped
while walking to work.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a warning to all of us," said Eric Larouche, director of
UNICEF operations in Afghanistan. "The country is still in transition,
and there's no doubt insecurity has increased."</TE>
<TE>   Some people are even saying the unthinkable: Things were better under
the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "No, we didn't like them," Habib Dullah, a currency trader, said as he
slammed down a brick of grubby Afghan bills. "But at least we were safe."</TE>
<TE>   The spate of attacks came just as factional leaders have laid aside
their rivalries to provide one of the most important postwar services:
security. A careful formula was reached to share police power among the
region's three main ethnic groups: the Tajiks, the Uzbeks and the Shiite
Muslim Hazaras.</TE>
<TE>   The city's top security official, Gen. Majid Rozy, is an ethnic Uzbek
and a confidant of Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, also an Uzbek and the
leading warlord in the north.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Mohammad Isa Eftakhouri, the police chief, is a Hazara, a member
of a sectarian minority that has often been persecuted in the past.</TE>
<TE>   The Tajiks supplied the largest portion of the police force's
personnel--240 from their barracks, compared with 180 from each of the
two other groups.</TE>
<TE>   Just five years ago, the three factions battled Beirut-style for
control of the city. Their feuding was one reason the Taliban was able to
capture Mazar-i-Sharif in 1997 and win recognition from several countries
as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   But after Sept. 11, the United States spurred the three sides to join
forces. With U.S. help and under the banner of the opposition Northern
Alliance, they drove the Taliban out of the city in November. That was
the first in a string of victories that brought the religious extremists
down.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, when local leaders discussed creating a police department,
U.N. advisors encouraged each group to contribute 200 soldiers. All of
Afghanistan is ethnically fragmented, but the north is especially torn
between groups with a history of violence. Peace meant parity, the U.N.
advisors said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet one hitch was Ata Mohammed. The tall, bearded Tajik warlord who
could double for Fidel Castro insisted on having more armed men in the
city than anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "Mazar territory is my territory, and I should have the most police,"
he said in an interview last week.</TE>
<TE>   His request was honored.</TE>
<TE>   The force began its duties Wednesday, and the new police--who are
outfitted like soldiers--have been diligently working together to search
trucks, taxis and even camels that lurch into town across the endless
Central Asian steppe.</TE>
<TE>   "Lift up your feet!" policeman Khair Mohammed yelled to a truck driver
at a checkpoint. "I see your gun."</TE>
<TE>   Two minutes later, Mohammed ducked into a mud shed to deposit a
confiscated AK-47. Next to it stood grenade launchers, machine guns and a
chest-high stack of ammunition boxes. All were cataloged according to
serial number. The owners had been told to retrieve their weapons when
they left the city.</TE>
<TE>   For those who don't comply, there's a new jail with a few prisoners
and a rudimentary court system to hear cases.</TE>
<TE>   The top warlords have partially cooperated with the disarmament
process by pulling out some of their militia forces and confining them to
barracks.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many less gunmen on the streets today than there were a
few weeks ago," said Martin Rose, a U.S. Army major stationed in
Mazar-i-Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   But plenty of heavily armed men still ply the back alleys and dirt
roads of this no-stoplight city of 200,000.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear whether militiamen were behind the spate of attacks on
aid workers. The perpetrators may have been freelance bandits. Many
foreign aid professionals say they are concerned that local workers were
targeted because of their connection to well-financed aid organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Parwiz Azizy, a driver for Save the Children, was ferrying a vanload
of ill women Monday night when he was waved over by three gunmen with
turbans wrapped over their faces.</TE>
<TE>   They punched him, stole his money, made all the women get out of the
van and then told Azizy to kneel on the road with his head bowed. His
life was spared, he said, only because one of the women flung back her
burka and jumped in front of the gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   "They were going to shoot me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The UNICEF official, an education program manager, was shot in his
home Saturday morning. He was hospitalized with a leg wound. The head of
Focus was kidnapped Thursday and was still missing Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   All the cases remained unsolved, although police said they were
working on them.</TE>
<TE>   "Even America can't build a society in one day, one week, one year,"
said Rozy, the Uzbek security chief.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the city, peace is even more elusive.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of miles south of Mazar-i-Sharif on the road to the capital,
Kabul, sit two mud-walled barracks, built on small hills.</TE>
<TE>   Young men in baggy pants, turbans and high-tops suck on cigarettes as
they patrol their forts, one belonging to an Uzbek faction, the other to
Hazaras.</TE>
<TE>   They guard nothing. The only thing between them is an old Soviet army
depot and the detritus of war: empty rocket launchers, thousands of spent
shells and tanks stripped of every switch, handle and gear.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear whether the feelings between the two groups mark an
enduring rivalry or signal deeper troubles to come.</TE>
<TE>   "They are bad people," said Awaz Ali, an Uzbek soldier, pointing to
the Hazara compound.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they should go back to the mountains," said a Hazara soldier,
jerking his head the other way.</TE>

<HD>An Afghan Governor With a Touch of L.A.</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GARDEZ, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>A single gas lamp lights the gloomy second-floor room where Taj
Mohamad Wardak has lived since he arrived to become governor of turbulent
Paktia province last week.</LD>
<LD>   The house was once grand, with a large bathroom and enamel bathtub.
Now the bathroom is, like most Afghan plumbing, not functional, and the
halls are drafty, damp and mud-stained.</LD>
<LD>   For Wardak, the world of rural Afghanistan couldn't be further from
the three-bedroom house with a pool in the North Hills neighborhood of
Los Angeles where he had spent the last 15 years. Still, he didn't
hesitate to come.</LD>
<TE>   "If America is heaven and Afghanistan is hell, then love is blind and
I am in love with Afghanistan," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When the radical Taliban regime was ousted and the interim
administration installed in Kabul last year, the gray-haired patriot
bought a ticket to Pakistan and then caught a United Nations flight to
the Afghan capital.</TE>
<TE>   Just a few days later, on Feb. 2, he was tapped to become governor of
Paktia province, which has been racked by fighting among warlords that
left nearly 60 people dead in the last two weeks. It's a job most people
would avoid at all costs. But not Wardak.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation is very bad here, and if I can be helpful, I will be
very glad," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wardak, who gives his age as 80, is one of a number of educated
Afghans in exile who have made the altruistic choice of forsaking the
comfort of Western life to help their war-damaged country recover. But he
is far older than most emigre returnees and is taking a job far from the
relative safety of Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Paktia, a mountainous province three hours south of Kabul, is
predominantly Pushtun, the same ethnic group from which Wardak comes--and
from which most of the Taliban members came. It was one of several
provinces where members of the Al Qaeda terrorist network and their
families lived. Many Al Qaeda members took refuge here after the Taliban
regime was ousted.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the issue of Al Qaeda holdouts, a more immediate
problem has been the fighting between two or three different warlords in
the province. One, Bacha Khan, who comes from the southern part of the
province, was appointed governor of Paktia in the early days of
Afghanistan's new interim administration.</TE>
<TE>   Khan, a warlord with a heavy black mustache and a heavier ammunition
belt, demanded loyalty of all the elders in the province but was
suspected of using his friendship with the U.S. to lure American forces
into bombing his enemies--including those elders who didn't favor his
appointment as governor.</TE>
<TE>   After a tumultuous few weeks, fighting broke out between supporters of
Haji Saifullah, a warlord here in Gardez, and Khan's troops. After two
days of clashes in which Khan lost a number of men, he was forced out,
leaving the province's governance in doubt.</TE>
<TE>   The situation was so unsettled that it began to hamper the U.S.
military in its war here against terrorism, and Washington asked interim
Prime Minister Hamid Karzai to intervene. Karzai sought a new governor
who could win the respect of the local people and would eschew the usual
warlord tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Wardak suddenly seemed a logical choice. He was from a well-regarded
family. His brother had been well liked when he was governor of Paktia
about 30 years ago, and Wardak himself had experience in the job--he had
served as governor of the northeastern province of Badakhshan in the
1970s. Furthermore, he had the critical Afghan credential of having
fought the Soviets when they controlled the country and of having served
more than two years in a Soviet prison.</TE>
<TE>   Wardak shares Karzai's view that the country has had enough of
warlords, and he is proud that he comes without an Afghan governor's
usual complement of scores of armed guards. "I go to the bazaar with just
my driver," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also feels strongly that Afghanistan must look to the West and to
the U.S. to help bring it into the modern age. Part of that is enforcing
the rule of law. And he believes that he will be able to bring order by
force of personality and by being firm rather than despotic.</TE>
<TE>   "We are here to implement the law. I am not just here as a priest--if
we have people here who do not obey the law, then we are guilty of not
doing our job," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Local leaders aren't so sure that his approach will work. They have
decided to swear fealty to him, but it takes time to create a deeper
loyalty. Mohammed Isak, the deputy to warlord Saifullah, was reserved in
his endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   "We brought him here, and we are protecting him, and we serve him as
soldiers, but he's only been here three days," he said. "We don't know if
he has the ability [to govern]."</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to overstate how different life must be for Wardak in
Afghanistan. He left a home that he describes as having "a good kitchen,
a nice yard and good bathrooms"--niceties that do not exist in
Afghanistan except perhaps in the very richest homes in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   One reason that Wardak is able to give his all to the job is that his
wife of many years died last summer.</TE>
<TE>   In Gardez, he lives in one room heated by an ancient, rusty wood stove
and sleeps on a mattress that rests on a chipped enamel bed frame.
Otherwise, the room is a traditional Afghan reception room, with cushions
along the wall, a rug on the floor and little else.</TE>
<TE>   Incongruously, there's a box with a brand-new Thuraya phone--the
latest in dual satellite and cell phone technology. Wardak hasn't figured
out how to use it yet. But because there are no phone lines here, it will
be a necessity.</TE>
<TE>   "This was my brother's home when he was governor here, but it has to
be repaired," Wardak said as workers could be heard lugging wheelbarrows
of plaster through the halls.</TE>
<TE>   On this sleeting February afternoon, he had a number of appointments
before his day ended. He adjusted his long black leather jacket--a gift
from his youngest daughter, who is studying at USC--over his traditional
Afghan shalwar kameez pants and shirt. Then came another American
garment--a beige Western raincoat.</TE>
<TE>   But the finishing touch was pure Afghan: an elegant turban of black,
gray and white raw silk.</TE>
<TE>   "The people here gave it to me at the swearing-in ceremony," he said,
smiling as he strode out the door--an Afghan with a bit of American in
him, but now deeply happy to be home.</TE>

<HD>Red Cross Questioned on Aid Fund</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Better Business Bureau, acting on complaints from donors to the
American Red Cross and critical reports about post-Sept. 11 fund-raising,
has asked the group for information to help determine whether it still
meets bureau standards for charities.</LD>
<LD>   "Certainly, the information we're asking for is out of the routine,"
H. Art Taylor, president and chief executive officer of the bureau's Wise
Giving Alliance, said in an interview Saturday. "We want to make sure
that the public can be confident in what's going on at the Red Cross."</LD>
<LD>   Officials at the Red Cross did not comment on the request Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   The alliance made the request last month for information about the
$850 million donated for its terrorist relief fund. The Red Cross was
criticized for initially saying it would use some money for projects
unrelated to the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to help donors decide if an organization is reputable,
the alliance rates national charities by 23 standards. They include
spending at least 50% of donations on the activities promoted when
raising money, and clearly specifying which programs and activities the
contributions will pay for.</TE>
<TE>   The reports are posted on the group's Web site, http://www.give.org.
The Red Cross entry at that site now says the bureau is seeking more
information "to complete a more current report."</TE>

<HD>Scores of Decomposing Corpses Found at Crematory</HD>
<DH>Georgia: A state of emergency is declared as teams comb grounds for
more bodies. Operator is charged with a felony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investigators scouring the woods behind a crematory in rural
Georgia found scores of decomposing corpses Saturday, including at least
93 intact bodies and other remains scattered along the ground.</LD>
<LD>   "You'd walk an area and see a skull here, a leg bone there, a rib cage
over there. It was very gruesome," said John Bankhead, a spokesman for
the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.</LD>
<LD>   The operator of the Tri-State Crematory, Brent Marsh, was arrested in
Walker County, in the northwest corner of Georgia. He was charged with
theft by deception, a felony; authorities allege that he contracted with
funeral homes in three states to cremate bodies but instead dumped the
corpses in the crematory, in storage sheds or in the woods on his 16-acre
property. Marsh had been running the crematory for several years on
behalf of his parents, who are prominent civic activists in the
community.</LD>
<TE>   Some of the bodies had apparently arrived within the last few weeks;
they were clad in hospital gowns, with identification tags still wrapped
around their toes. Others had clearly been there for years.</TE>
<TE>   One body, so decomposed it looked like a mummy, was laid out in a blue
funeral suit in the box used for cremation. Other corpses were in
caskets. A few had been buried in the crematory grounds.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst horror movie you've ever seen--imagine that 10 times
worse," Walker County Coroner Dewayne Wilson told the local media.
"That's what I'm dealing with."</TE>
<TE>   The scene, about 85 miles northwest of Atlanta, was so overwhelming
that Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes declared a state of emergency in Walker
County and sent in dozens of state investigators. By late Saturday, they
had identified 13 corpses, discovered 80 others intact and collected
uncounted numbers of bones.</TE>
<TE>   "And this is just what they can see," said Lisa Ray of the Georgia
Emergency Management Agency. "They haven't even started excavating."</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 investigators were to comb the grounds throughout the
weekend, while grief counselors waited in a church to counsel families
whose loved ones had been sent to the crematory in the small,
unincorporated community of Noble, near the town of Rock Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Frantic to find out the fate of their relatives, family members
bombarded funeral homes with questions Saturday, venting fury and horror.
"I've got three lines holding right now, and we've been flooded with
calls all day," reported one funeral home director in Rossville, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   He could give few satisfactory answers.</TE>
<TE>   While several of the corpses were easily identified from toe tags,
many more were decomposed to bare bones. Authorities believe all of the
remains come from bodies brought to the site for cremation.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear exactly what relatives received from the crematory in
lieu of ashes. "Wood chips, possibly," Bankhead said.</TE>
<TE>   The probe of the Tri-State Crematory, which serves northwest Georgia
and northeast Alabama and southeast Tennessee, began Friday, when the
Environmental Protection Agency in Atlanta received an anonymous call
complaining about a stench from the property. EPA investigators visited
the site and found a human skull. They then called in local
investigators, who found body after body, working late into the evening.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery stunned residents of Walker County--and not only because
it was so grisly.</TE>
<TE>   Ray and Clara Marsh, who have owned the Tri-State Crematory for about
30 years, are well respected in the community, which one local described
as "like every other small Southern town"--quiet and slow-paced and
friendly, "with everything as it was a long time ago."</TE>
<TE>   Clara Marsh, a retired teacher, is well-known for her work combating
drug abuse in the schools and recently was honored as Walker County's
citizen of the year. This year, Ray Marsh served on a panel of the
region's most prominent citizens. And both are active volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   A woman answering the phone at the Marsh home Saturday said they would
have no comment. But plenty of acquaintances stepped forward to speak on
their behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "They're just all-around stellar citizens," said Stan Porter,
chairman-elect of the Walker County Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   "This doesn't make a bit of sense," added Randy Bryant, a member of
the local school board.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the Marshes, who are in their 60s, turned management
of the crematory over to their son around 1996. That is when the corpses
allegedly began to pile up, Bankhead said.</TE>
<TE>   But Bill McGill, a former county coroner, suggested that problems with
the crematory stretch back earlier. He said that he repeatedly complained
to state officials in the early 1990s that the Tri-State Crematory was
not licensed and did not have a state-licensed funeral director on the
premises, as required. What's more, he said it did not get permits for
each cremation, as mandated by state law.</TE>
<TE>   McGill said state inspectors told him they could look only at licensed
facilities--a Catch-22 that left him fuming but helpless.</TE>
<TE>   "I pushed it and pushed it as far as I could," said McGill, who
retired in 2000. "I don't know what kind of pull [the Marshes] had . . .
but I couldn't get anything done."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Brent Marsh has been cooperating with the
investigation. He could face up to five years behind bars for each count
of theft by deception, a felony. So far he has been charged with five
counts, but officials expect more.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Marshes have also been cooperating fully, turning over all
their crematory records. No decision has yet been made on whether they
too will face charges.</TE>
<TE>   "The district attorney is still assessing that situation," Ray said.</TE>

<HD>In-Flight Wish List: Firearms, Tasers</HD>
<DH>Safety: Pilots favor semiautomatics, while attendants want stun
guns. Government to begin debating the issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>American Airlines Capt. Linda Pauwels is an "anti-gun" mom who
keeps her two young children away from violent video games and television
shows.</LD>
<LD>   Yet if the government allows pilots to pack a pistol to defend the
cockpit against hijackers, Pauwels said she'll get a gun and explain to
the kids that she needs it for work.</LD>
<LD>   Flight attendant Alin Boswell always prided himself on keeping the
customers happy. Now he worries a customer could turn out to be a
terrorist he'd have to battle at 30,000 feet.</LD>
<TE>   "You look at everything, from wine bottles to oxygen bottles to fire
extinguishers--anything you can use to protect yourself," Boswell said.
Ideally, he said, he'd like a stun gun, which fires electrically charged
darts to temporarily immobilize an attacker.</TE>
<TE>   Five months after the Sept. 11 attacks, pilots and flight attendants
complain they have yet to receive any meaningful self-defense training,
though their jobs now require them to take down anyone from a shoe bomber
to a business traveler who suddenly decides to kick in the cockpit door.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the government begins formal consideration of demands from
flight crews for a new kind of standard-issue equipment: The pilots want
semiautomatics, while the flight attendants say stun guns would be a
wiser option for both. More than 6,000 people have responded to a Federal
Aviation Administration request for public comments, and the vast
majority support arming crews--with firearms.</TE>
<TE>   But airlines adamantly oppose firearms, and some Transportation
Department officials fear any kind of weaponry will lead to unintended
consequences. "This is not something that is a slam dunk," said one
official, referring to firearms. "As for Tasers [stun guns], I'm not sure
how one trains for it, but don't volunteer me."</TE>
<TE>   While the government deliberates, pilots and flight attendants wrestle
with anxiety and a lingering sense of vulnerability. The stepped-up
security at airports offers little reassurance, they say. Instead, it
often adds unneeded hassles.</TE>
<TE>   Even with uniforms and airline ID, crew members are subject to metal
detection wands, shoe checks, pat-downs and hand searches of their bags,
though workers who service planes on the ground do not have to endure
such rigors.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing doesn't make any sense," said Pauwels, who lives in
Mission Viejo and flies MD 80 jetliners out of Los Angeles International
Airport. "I have had my personal hygiene products removed from my bag and
looked at. That is very embarrassing. It's difficult when you're doing
this job to be treated as if you're part of the problem, not the
solution."</TE>
<TE>   "Going to work is just like getting flogged," said another airline
pilot, who asked not to be identified because his company discourages
media interviews. "I go through security and I just have to bite my
tongue, because I don't want to say anything that might get me arrested."</TE>
<TE>   On a certain level, the push by pilots to be armed is about repairing
psychological damage. Their proudly autonomous profession was grossly
violated by the events of Sept. 11, and now they endure a thousand
perceived affronts, such as the confiscation of pocket tools they
routinely carried for small emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't understand what we mean when we say 'Arm the pilots,' "
said Capt. Steve Luckey, the leading security expert for the Air Line
Pilots Assn. "Just giving the pilot a gun would be a very irresponsible
approach. We're talking about a program that would be built with the help
of the FBI. These would be armed federal officers, who happen to be
recruited from pilot ranks." The volunteer pilots would augment the ranks
of federal air marshals.</TE>
<TE>   The idea has gut-level appeal, critics say, but it is also fraught
with problems. A gunfight at cruising altitude could damage the aircraft
or lead to a loss of control. And what if a deputized pilot shot a
frequent flier by mistake? Would the pilot go to jail? Would the airline
be liable?</TE>
<TE>   "It makes far more sense to armor the cockpit door against small arms
fire and blast forces than to arm pilots with a lethal weapon," said
Douglas Laird, a former Secret Service agent and former security director
for Northwest Airlines. "The role of the pilot in any crisis is to get
the plane on the ground. That in itself is a challenge, and you don't
need to divert their attention."</TE>
<TE>   Pilots respond that they would draw their guns only under very limited
circumstances--if there was no other way of stopping an intruder who
broke into the cockpit. Just last week, a co-pilot on a Miami-to-Buenos
Aires flight used the blunt end of an emergency ax to clobber a man who
tried to get in the cockpit. What if that man had been armed?</TE>
<TE>   "Barriers are broken and security systems fail," said Pauwels, who is
also an official spokeswoman for the Allied Pilots Assn. "If there is
more than one person who wants to wreak havoc, it's possible that they
may be able to penetrate the cockpit barrier. If these people knew that
you were armed, that would change things."</TE>
<TE>   In polls, more than 80% of pilots say they want weapons, and about the
same proportion of the general public agrees. Yet the minority of pilots
who disagree raise well-considered objections.</TE>
<TE>   "The odds of a pilot using a firearm in the ultimate scenario are
infinitesimal compared with the odds of having an embarrassing incident,"
said a Boeing 737 pilot who requested anonymity. "The potential damage to
the profession outweighs the benefit."</TE>
<TE>   Flight attendants are also at odds with pilots over firearms. "We
don't think it's the best idea for the pilots," said Dawn Deeks, a
spokeswoman for the Assn. of Flight Attendants. Yet the flight attendants
want stun guns for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been told repeatedly by our pilots that we are on our own,"
said Boswell, a flight attendant for 13 years. "We could be screaming and
getting killed, and they are not going to open that cockpit door. We're
on the other side of the door, and we're the ones who need the help."</TE>
<TE>   Boswell lives in the Washington suburbs and drives by the Pentagon on
his way to work at Ronald Reagan National Airport. On Sept. 11, he was
aboard a transcontinental flight and found out what happened only after
his plane was ordered to land.</TE>
<TE>   "There has just been a whole shift in the mind-set of the crews since
then," he said. "If you think you're going to take my plane, it's pretty
much going to have to be over my dead body."</TE>
<TE>   But he wants a fighting chance. "I want something that would
incapacitate a person," Boswell said. "I don't want to take a person out
permanently, but I want to be able to get the situation under control."</TE>
<TE>   Whether stun guns could be used to restore control--or whether they
would create more opportunities for chaos--remains to be seen. The
Justice Department is soon expected to deliver a technical report on the
issue to the new federal Transportation Security Administration. Among
the unanswered questions: How effective are stun guns? Could they be
safely stowed on board? Is there a foolproof way to guarantee that flight
attendants could access the weapons in an emergency? What if a
terrorist--or merely an unruly passenger--got hold of a Taser? What if
someone takes a blast and keeps charging?</TE>
<TE>   Some airlines are already on record as favoring stun guns. "We support
the Taser," said Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for United Airlines. "We feel
that they would be effective, and we have done our own testing that
indicates that. One advantage is that it's not going to penetrate the
skin of the aircraft."</TE>
<TE>   The government has set no deadline for a decision on stun guns or
firearms. Meanwhile, the FAA is counseling pilots and flight attendants
to be patient. The agency has issued new guidelines for anti-hijacking
training, and spokesman Les Dorr said most flight crew members will be
retrained by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The new training will provide the latest survival skills and
strategies for various crisis scenarios. "This is going to be developed
by the FBI," Dorr said. "The prime consideration is to get the airplane
on the ground as soon as possible to prevent it from being commandeered
and used as a weapon of mass destruction."</TE>
<TE>   Pauwels said that assurance is not enough for her. She's not sure she
can ever let down her guard again. "Let's say that we are successful and
we don't see any more events like those of Sept. 11," Pauwels said. "Some
of us might stop paying attention. We might get careless. If the pilots
were armed, at least we'd have that last line of defense always there."</TE>

<LD>Governors in three Midwestern states lashed by a late January storm
have asked the federal government for disaster aid to pay for nearly $200
million in storm-related damage and costs.</LD>
<LD>   The federal government typically pays 75% of public disaster aid, with
state and local governments picking up the rest. Kansas and Oklahoma are
asking for full relief. Missouri is seeking 90%.</LD>
<LD>   Without full federal aid, "the economic impact to the state will be
extremely devastating," Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating said in a letter to
President Bush.</LD>

fish, scientists say.</LD>

from Australia to Malaysia, live in a stretch of coast from southern

<HD>Upgraded Patriot Missile Fails in Intercept Test</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A missile that the U.S. military hopes will be part of the Bush
administration's missile defense program failed to intercept its target
during a test Saturday, the Army said.</LD>
<LD>   The upgraded Patriot Advanced Capability 3, or PAC-3, missile, made by
Lockheed Martin Corp., was supposed to intercept a cruise missile target
in the test in New Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   Two other older Raytheon Co. PAC-2 missiles also were launched as part
of the test. The Army said one of the two missiles scored a successful
hit, destroying an unmanned aircraft.</LD>
<TE>   The "hit-to-kill" missiles, advanced versions of the Patriot
anti-aircraft missile used against Iraqi Scud missiles in the 1991
Persian Gulf War, are designed to collide with their targets in flight at
high speed.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents of the anti-missile system have argued that
technological problems could prevent the program from becoming a viable
defense system for the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The administration hopes the system eventually will shield American
cities, as well as U.S. troops and overseas bases, from missile attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's test was designed to simultaneously shoot down a
remote-controlled QF-4 Phantom fighter jet, a cruise missile and a
smaller unmanned aircraft. This first operational test followed 11
successful developmental flight tests.</TE>
<TE>   The next test has not yet been scheduled, but the military is hoping
to complete the current round of four tests on the PAC-3 system by May.</TE>
<TE>   The PAC-3 missile tested Saturday is designed to provide upgraded
defenses against modern battlefield ballistic missiles, cruise missiles
and aircraft.</TE>

<HD>For Bush, Cheney, It's Off to the Political Battlefields</HD>
<DH>Campaigns: They're ratcheting up their fund-raising for GOP
candidates. VP visits the state Monday in his first major trip since
Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>With Sept. 11 in their rearview mirror, President Bush and Vice
President Dick Cheney are driving with ever-greater determination into
the political year.</LD>
<LD>   They are stepping up their fund-raising, making speeches in states
that have closely watched elections and otherwise are engaging in the
overt political activities they had shunned for months. As part of that
effort, Cheney is embarking on a four-day California visit starting
Monday, his first major trip since the terrorist attacks on the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   The vice president plans to give a speech at Marine Corps Air Station
Miramar in San Diego, speak at the Richard Nixon presidential library in
Yorba Linda, appear on "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno," tour a
high-technology company in San Jose and raise money for the reelection
campaigns of U.S. Reps. Richard W. Pombo (R-Tracy) and John T. Doolittle
(R-Rocklin).</LD>
<TE>   The trip shows how Cheney is shedding--at least for this campaign
season--the behind-the-scenes role he played not just since Sept. 11 but
throughout much of the Bush administration. Unlikely to change, though,
is his low-key political manner. He is expected to deliver a message that
avoids the type of red-meat attacks vice presidents often are called upon
to provide while presidents remain above the fray.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick Cheney is known for many things, but partisan flamboyance is not
one of them," White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, for his part, is quietly going about raising money for
Republican candidates on his travels beyond Washington, often doing so
after public events that focus on his policy agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, en route to Tokyo on Saturday, Bush stopped briefly in
Anchorage, where in addition to meeting with U.S. troops, he found time
to speak at a fund-raiser for the Alaska Republican Party. The political
event raised about $400,000, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   As in his other recent fund-raising remarks, Bush avoided heavily
partisan language and, instead, talked mostly about the war on terrorism
while praising the state's many elected officials, including Sens. Ted
Stevens and Frank H. Murkowski, both Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   After slightly more than a year in office, Bush has raised nearly $52
million for GOP candidates and party campaign accounts. In recent weeks,
he has spoken at three fund-raisers that generated about $3.5 million for
three Republican governors seeking second terms: His brother, Jeb Bush of
Florida; George Pataki of New York; and Scott McCallum of Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   The president also recently recorded television and radio
advertisements targeted at Democratic senators considered vulnerable to
defeat in November--and therein lies a wrinkle in the fabric of
bipartisanship with which Bush has tried to cloak much of his presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Among those the ads take aim at are Max Baucus of Montana, Tim Johnson
of South Dakota and Jean Carnahan of Missouri. Each voted for Bush's
$1.35-trillion tax cut, a central piece of his economic policy agenda,
and each supported the administration on 71% of key votes last year,
according to Congressional Quarterly, but Bush has chosen to use them as
poster senators for the Democratic leadership's opposition to the
economic stimulus legislation he has been unable to get through Congress.</TE>
<TE>   In the new ads, an announcer says: "When times are tough, Americans
are united. We put aside our differences and do what's best for the
nation. It's why President Bush and moderate Democrats reached a
compromise plan to get America back to work."</TE>
<TE>   Bush then says: "A lot of people have lost their jobs and don't have
health care. But sadly, partisan Democrats like [here he inserts the name
of the senator] voted against the compromise. There's something more
important than politics--and that's to do our jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.), who has made a point of working with
Bush, took umbrage at the ads.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, I'm from Louisiana. I know politics," but, he added, "if
anything can kill an effort to work together, it's politics as usual."</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Palmieri, spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee,
was more blunt. The ads, she said, prove that "George Bush is a mortal;
he does politics just like everyone else. Is Bush going to be the
commander in chief who unified everyone or is he going to be head of his
party? I was surprised to see he chose the party role so quickly."</TE>
<TE>   In the view of Ross K. Baker, a Rutgers University political scientist
with expertise in Congress, the shift has been more gradual. "The move
back to politics has been almost imperceptible," he said. "It's a credit
to the pacing and timing of the White House."</TE>
<TE>   It is about time Bush and Cheney tended to pure politics, argued Rich
N. Bond, a former Republican National Committee chairman.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that the president's agenda suffers because of a [Democratic
majority in the Senate] proves a compelling case for resuming political
leadership," Bond said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to see some huge percentage of their time taken up
in fund-raising. But in the absence of almost any political activity for
four or five months, there's pent-up demand. We need Bush's and Cheney's
voice out there."</TE>

<HD>Bush Pushes for Arctic Oil Drilling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE
</DL>
<LD>President Bush made a strong appeal here Saturday for opening the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to energy exploration, saying that such a
move would start the nation toward energy independence.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got to find energy in our own country. And a great place to
start is right here in the great state of Alaska," Bush said of his
proposal to explore a portion of the pristine refuge in the northernmost
reaches of Alaska.</LD>
<LD>   That plan, as did a similar push by his father, has drawn strong
condemnation from environmentalists and has met with determined
opposition from the Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate.</LD>
<TE>   But the president brushed aside those concerns during a speech before
military personnel at Elmendorf Air Force Base, adding that such
exploration also would be "good for jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also defended his $1.35-billion tax cut and called on the Senate
to enact an economic stimulus package.</TE>
<TE>   The president stopped here on his way to Tokyo as part of a weeklong
Asia trip that also will take him to Seoul and Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard 'em all in Washington," Bush said dismissively of his
critics on oil drilling in Alaska. "I've heard all the skeptics say:
'Well, you can't do that; it's going to ruin this or that.'</TE>
<TE>   "Listen, there's no doubt in my mind, there's no doubt in your
governor's mind, there's no doubt in the minds of people who take a
sound, scientific look at this that we can do so without endangering the
environment, that we can find energy for America's people and, at the
same time, preserve the beauty of Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   "What we need is a common-sense approach to energy," he added.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the Senate is expected soon to begin debate on
comprehensive energy legislation, with Republicans and Democrats offering
competing plans.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican House last summer passed a wide-ranging energy bill,
based largely on the agenda issued by the Bush administration in May
2001.</TE>
<TE>   The development of the administration's energy policy was headed by
Vice President Dick Cheney, like Bush a former oilman. Cheney and his
task force have come under fire not only for some of its controversial
elements but also for not disclosing details of their work--a dispute
between the White House and Congress that is headed for the federal
courts in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday was Bush's first visit to Alaska since the summer of 1974. He
worked a desk job for an airline and a construction company during the
state's energy boom, when a pipeline was built to transport newly
discovered oil from Prudhoe Bay.</TE>
<TE>   The Prudhoe Bay fields, a major source of crude oil for California,
are in decline, and the oil industry wants to look for more oil in the
wildlife refuge east of the oil fields.</TE>

<HD>Former Councilwoman Wins Dallas Mayoral Runoff</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>A runoff race overshadowed by accusations of ballot tampering and
bribery came to a decisive end Saturday as Dallas voters elected former
City Councilwoman Laura Miller mayor of the nation's ninth largest city.</LD>
<LD>   With all precincts reporting, Miller had 54.9% of the vote, trouncing
insurance executive Tom Dunning in a contentious race to succeed former
Mayor Ron Kirk, who resigned in November to run for the U.S. Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Running on a campaign to take care of the "little things that make a
big difference in people's lives," Miller pledged to focus on basic city
services, such as street repairs, public schools and crime control.</LD>
<TE>   "I truly think the citizens want City Hall to focus on them and their
neighborhoods and their families," Miller, 43, said at her victory party.</TE>
<TE>   In a five-candidate mayoral election Jan. 19, Miller won 49% of the
vote, just shy of the 50% plus one vote needed to win the office
outright. Dunning came in second, getting 38% of the vote and the right
to meet Miller in Saturday's runoff.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the general election, both candidates faced allegations
that they tried to buy the endorsement of a defeated contender, state
Rep. Domingo Garcia. The allegations stemmed from a radio interview in
which a Garcia supporter said that white business leaders would have to
pay off Garcia's campaign debt before Dunning would win Garcia's
endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   Though Garcia later endorsed Dunning, both men denied cutting a deal.
Garcia said that he used his own money to pay campaign expenses, and that
it was Miller and her husband, a state legislator, who proposed the
money-for-endorsement exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "I would never, ever offer anything to Domingo Garcia," Miller said.
"I wouldn't even buy him lunch."</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney of neighboring Fort Worth is investigating the
allegations at the request of the Dallas district attorney's office,
which stepped aside to avoid any conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Another flap erupted when two campaign workers for Dunning were
accused of running a door-to-door campaign to collect mail-in voting
ballots from senior citizens. Though the practice is legal, Dunning and
Miller had earlier come out against it, citing concerns about possible
abuse when eager campaign workers help voters fill out ballots. On
Wednesday, Dunning fired the campaign worker who ran the ballot
collection drive.</TE>
<TE>   Miller is a former newspaper columnist who once wrote that Dallas City
Council members were "brain dead." After her election to the council in
1998, Miller continued to be an outspoken critic. She was a reliable
source of aggravation to Kirk, whose legacy of big projects--such as a
$420-million sports arena and the failed pursuit of the 2012 Summer
Olympics--were anathema to her pledge to provide basic city services.</TE>
<TE>   If Miller ran as a politically savvy crusader, Dunning, 59, was the
establishment candidate who campaigned on his business experience and
connections that could bring jobs to Dallas. A successful insurance
executive and former chairman of the Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport board, Dunning raised $2 million in campaign contributions to
Miller's $1.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Miller will serve as mayor for the remainder of Kirk's term, which
ends in May 2003. She can then run for a full four-year term.</TE>

<HD>Bush Puts Asia Back at Top of Agenda</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: President leaves on a long-shelved visit to Japan, South
Korea and China. He stresses his determination to take the anti-terror
war beyond Afghanistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>ELMENDORF AIR FORCE BASE, Alaska
</DL>
<LD>President Bush set off Saturday for a three-nation tour of Asia
that will finally get him back to the region--and issues--he initially
intended to make a cornerstone of his administration's foreign policy.</LD>
<LD>   According to U.S. officials, the six-day trip is designed to signal
that the war on terrorism has not diverted the United States' attention
from either its broader agenda or the rest of the world.</LD>
<LD>   In his Saturday radio address, Bush said the common theme during his
talks in Japan, South Korea and China will be building "a better world
beyond terror--a world of greater opportunity and more open trade,
stronger security and more individual freedom."</LD>
<TE>   En route to Tokyo, during a brief stop at this base just 44 miles
across the Bering Strait from the former Soviet Union, the president did
reemphasize his determination to take the war on terrorism beyond
Afghanistan. He also reiterated his warning to Iraqi leaders that they
risk a U.S. attack unless they begin to "conform to normal ways of
treating their own people, plus their own neighborhood, plus the world."</TE>
<TE>   Although he did not mention Iraq specifically, his reference to it was
unmistakable, as he cited "those who have gassed their own citizens."</TE>
<TE>   But returning to his immediate agenda, the president said he will make
clear to the leaders of Japan, South Korea and China that "the resolve of
this nation is steady and strong [and that] when it comes to defending
freedom, the United States will not blink."</TE>
<TE>   Still, so much has changed since the president was supposed to make
this trip last fall that Bush is likely to face tougher issues--and a
more tempered reception--in Japan and South Korea, America's two closest
Asian allies, than in China, say U.S. and Asian analysts. He could even
face angry demonstrations in South Korea, where 37,000 U.S. troops are
based.</TE>
<TE>   He might achieve the most tangible results in Beijing, where the
administration hopes to win agreement to set up an FBI office to work
with China on terrorism and security issues.</TE>
<TE>   The substance of the trip is reflected in the symbolism of the
president's stops.</TE>
<TE>   On the Korean peninsula, Bush will travel to the demilitarized zone
bordering North Korea, which he last month labeled one of three countries
in an "axis of evil." In Tokyo, he will address Japan's parliament to
encourage reforms to prevent an economic collapse. And in China, where he
will land almost exactly 30 years after President Nixon's historic visit,
he will give a nationally broadcast speech at Qinghua University, a
symbol of the new generation that the U.S. hopes will usher in change.</TE>
<TE>   The reception accorded Bush in public at each stop is likely to be
warm, but he is also likely to feel strains beneath the surface. In
Japan, the first stop, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's economic
reforms have fallen short, and the U.S. is increasingly concerned about a
meltdown of the banking system. Koizumi fears being pushed too much in
public, while the administration fears that without pressure from the
U.S., a collapse will be unavoidable.</TE>
<TE>   In Seoul, the government of President Kim Dae Jung has been barely
able to hide its fury over Bush's "axis of evil" remarks, which have been
another nail in the coffin for Kim's reconciliation efforts with North
Korea.</TE>
<TE>   In Beijing, differences are still deep over everything from religious
freedom to missile defense, despite the new ties created by cooperation
in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Bush will arrive later today in Japan, where the schedule for the
summit last fall would have been much better for both sides. Koizumi's
popularity then was at historical highs. And he was in Washington's good
graces because of his financial and military contributions to the war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Japanese economy is decidedly worse. And Koizumi's
popularity has plummeted to about 45%, while his economic reform policies
are increasingly mired in domestic politics.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a really tough time for Koizumi," said Motofumi Asai of Meiji
Gakuin University. "He has a tiger at the front door and a wolf at the
back gate."</TE>
<TE>   Japan cobbled together an economic package on the eve of the visit to
address U.S. concerns. But analysts in Japan don't expect it to address
much more than the symptoms of the country's economic malaise.</TE>
<TE>   In his radio address, Bush offered his first nudge, expressing
confidence that Japan will launch "bold reforms" to deal with its
"economic uncertainty and transition" and restore "growth and
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   But Tokyo still fears that U.S. support and expectations are eroding
as yet another Japanese government fails to deliver on reform. This, in
turn, is feeding Japan's deep insecurity that the world will sidle up to
China and marginalize Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Bush can also expect a strained meeting with Kim in Seoul on
Wednesday. Kim's conciliatory approach toward the North has been
faltering since the leaders' first meeting in March, when Bush publicly
disparaged the policies that had earned Kim a Nobel peace prize.</TE>
<TE>   Kim, a lame duck, is anxious to show progress with the North before
the next presidential election, Dec. 18, both to aid his political allies
and to seal his legacy as a peacemaker.</TE>
<TE>   In his radio address, Bush said he supports reconciliation efforts but
added that Washington will not allow the North to "threaten freedom with
weapons of mass destruction." He also called the DMZ "one of the most
dangerous places on Earth."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say there is no contradiction between supporting Kim's
policy and labeling North Korea an evil nation.</TE>
<TE>   But the South Korean public hasn't bought it. Bush's "axis of evil"
speech was denounced in editorials and by labor unions, Buddhist and
Christian groups, students and even some conservatives. Seoul has
witnessed several protests over the past two weeks, with riot police
struggling to keep them from the U.S. Embassy.</TE>
<TE>   Park Young Ho, director of the Korea Institute for National
Unification, a government think tank, said many South Koreans are
genuinely frightened that Bush will drag the Korean peninsula into the
war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "South Korea has become a hostage in this war of rhetoric between the
United States and North Korea," Park said. "I think the feeling of
ordinary Koreans is that North Korea is gradually changing and that these
kind of remarks are not helpful."</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sept. 11 actually helped repair Sino-U.S. ties. By last
week, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was describing the countries'
ties as "candid, constructive and cooperative" in congressional
testimony.</TE>
<TE>   But perennial sticking points are expected to come up in talks between
Bush and Chinese President Jiang Zemin, which will focus on four issues:
human rights, Taiwan, U.S. missile defense and weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said Saturday that he will encourage China "to embrace the
universal demands of human dignity, freedom of conscience and religion,
and the rights and value of every life."</TE>
<TE>   The president is also expected to try to calm Beijing's concerns over
the controversial U.S. plan to build a missile defense shield by making
clear that it would not be directed at China or intended to give
Washington "unilateral advantage," National Security Advisor Condoleezza
Rice told reporters last week.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is also likely to have a chance to take the initial measure of
the man expected to lead China's 1.3 billion people starting next year.
Vice President Hu Jintao is due to take over when Jiang retires in early
2003. Little is known about Hu overseas, except that late paramount
leader Deng Xiaoping anointed him to succeed Jiang. Bush and Hu are
expected to meet when the president talks to the next generation of
Chinese officials.</TE>
<TE>   The signal of how well the working visit went will be the kind of
invitation Bush extends to Jiang for his fall trip to the United States.
The Chinese leader is angling for an invitation to Bush's Texas ranch,
although U.S. officials said Friday that the president had not yet made
up his mind about whether to do so.</TE>

<KH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</KH>
<HD>Davis' Education Reforms Fail 3 Challengers' Tests</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's public schools have enjoyed rising test scores three
years running, but you wouldn't know it from the Republican challengers
to Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   They see chronic failure and little progress.</LD>
<LD>   "There has not been any major breakthrough in education, other than in
some individual districts like L.A.," said former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan, the leading GOP contender.</LD>
<TE>   Riordan and his two Republican rivals--financier Bill Simon Jr. and
Secretary of State Bill Jones--face a test of their own in the March 5
primary. They must persuade impatient voters that they can transform the
state's educational system.</TE>
<TE>   Polls show that education continues to be the top concern of
California voters--even ahead of the state's sagging economy and energy
woes. Many share the contenders' view that schools have failed to improve
since Davis took office three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Educators doubt whether anyone can deliver rapid change in a state as
large and diverse as California, especially at a time when schools are
confronting the converging forces of budget cuts and growing enrollments.</TE>
<TE>   "We have allowed our educational infrastructure to deteriorate for two
decades. It's going to take a long time and lot of investment to rebuild
it," said Jeannie Oakes, director of UCLA's Institute for Democracy,
Education and Access.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has added billions of dollars to the education budget and made
the issue his No. 1 priority throughout much of his term. The governor
has emphasized teacher training and recruitment programs, reading
instruction for children, and an accountability system that ranks schools
by their test scores.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has won praise for his reforms from teachers unions,
administrator groups and school district superintendents. Even so, he
remains politically vulnerable because of public perception that schools
are making little, if any, progress.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican challengers attack Davis as an ineffective leader on
education, while they pitch traditional GOP themes: Slash bloated
bureaucracies and return control over money and teaching to local
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Jones is the only Republican candidate to put forward a formal plan
for recruiting more teachers, an urgent need in a state that must hire
nearly 200,000 additional instructors over the next decade. His GOP
counterparts talk about opening more charter schools, streamlining
education budgets and freeing schools from unnecessary state regulations.</TE>
<TE>   While the three Republicans agree with Davis on the need to hold
schools accountable for their test scores, none offers detailed
blueprints for accomplishing the goal. And the candidates devote little,
if any, attention to the vexing problem of how to lift the
lowest-performing schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Their proposals are very partial and fragmented. These people do not
have interlocking strategies that would reform California schools," said
Michael Kirst, an education professor at Stanford University and the
former president of the state Board of Education. "They are disappointing
even compared to prior [gubernatorial] candidates."</TE>
<TE>   While Jones, Riordan and Simon have offered proposals for improving
academic achievement, they have paid little attention to the social and
economic conditions beyond the school walls that hinder learning.</TE>
<TE>Children's Advocates Draw Up Priority List</TE>
<TE>   Children's advocates say the next governor--Democrat or
Republican--must promote universal preschool, expanded networks of health
clinics, more breakfast programs, extra English classes for parents and
more student support services, from psychologists to child-abuse
counselors.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan and Jones talk about the need to improve medical care for poor
children. Jones calls for new programs to educate parents and students
about the consequences of bad diets. All three GOP candidates also speak
about the importance of after-school programs.</TE>
<TE>   Extensive proposals along these lines, however, would require whole
new investments that are unlikely in an atmosphere of financial
austerity.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a real disconnect between the political process and
what actually happens on the ground," said Carol Valentine, the family
literacy coordinator at the Elizabeth Street Learning Center in Cudahy.</TE>
<TE>   The pre-kindergarten-through-12th-grade school, in southeast Los
Angeles County, features a separate health clinic and family center on
its grounds. The facilities provide low-cost medical care, mental health
counseling, child care, and classes for parents to learn English and earn
high school diplomas.</TE>
<TE>   "To a lot of politicians, these people are untouchables because they
don't vote," Valentine said of the mostly Spanish-speaking families at
the center. "Of course, the health of our entire community depends on how
everyone does."</TE>
<TE>   Davis ran for governor four years ago on a pledge to fix the state's
public school system. As governor, he continued reforms launched by his
predecessor, Republican Pete Wilson, including the Stanford 9 exam and
smaller classes of 20 students per teacher in the primary grades.</TE>
<TE>   Declaring education his "first, second and third priority," Davis
devoted billions of dollars to recruit teachers to under-performing
schools, to create a high school graduation exam and to launch his
accountability system, which punishes schools for continual failure but
rewards those that show big testing gains.</TE>
<TE>   From the outset, Davis said he would run for reelection only if
student test scores improved. In fact, statewide scores have gone up for
most of the tested grade levels over the last three years.</TE>
<TE>Public Perception Seen as Davis' Achilles Heel</TE>
<TE>   The primary grades, the focus of the most intense reforms under Davis
and Wilson, have made the most progress, earning double-digit gains in
some cases. Middle schools improved by a smaller margin. High school
performance has remained flat.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very proud of the progress [in] the vast majority of schools,"
Davis said. "Almost through sheer will, we have put reforms into place
that are working for students and teachers alike."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Davis has had a hard time capitalizing on the positive news in
the schools.</TE>
<TE>   Only a quarter of registered voters in California believe that schools
have improved since he took office, and nearly 1 in 5 believe the schools
have worsened, a Los Angeles Times poll found last month.</TE>
<TE>   A separate survey, conducted by the Public Policy Institute of
California, found that just 39% of California residents approve of Davis'
work on education, down from 51% two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say that public perception is Davis' Achilles heel--a
liability that his eventual Republican challenger is certain to exploit
in the general election.</TE>
<TE>   "Davis has to make the case that things improved on his watch," said
Mark Baldassare, a senior fellow at the institute and the director of the
recent survey.</TE>
<TE>   Davis acknowledged the uphill battle to sway public opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "Perception will follow reality," the governor insisted. "Our job is
to communicate. Over time, people will understand that collectively we
have made remarkable progress." Davis' Republican challengers are sending
a contrary message. Virtually ignoring the Stanford 9 testing gains, they
have instead seized on another set of test statistics that paint a bleak
picture of California education.</TE>
<TE>   The three Republicans cite the state's last-place finish in a set of
reading, math and science exams that compares the performances ofchildren
in 40 states. In the most recent round of science testing, for example,
California's fourth-graders trailed their peers in 39 other states,
including Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and leading educators say the low scores reflect large
proportion of students in California who speak limited English. The
Republican candidates blame the governor.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis has failed to understand the need for serious education
reform, and it is costing our children their future," Riordan said when
the science results were released last fall.</TE>
<TE>   But for all his criticism of Davis, Riordan argues that the key to
improving schools rests not with the governor but with effective local
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   To make his case, the former mayor touts his own experience in Los
Angeles. Although he had no direct authority over the schools, Riordan
recruited and supported several reform-minded candidates for the city's
Board of Education in two successive elections in 1999 and 2001. He cites
their election as his single proudest achievement as mayor.</TE>
<TE>   The newly constituted school board ousted the superintendent, hired a
new schools chief and pressed reading reforms in the elementary schools.
Test scores are on the rise.</TE>
<TE>   "I take a little credit for L.A. because I was part of getting the new
school board elected," said Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   The former mayor has been widely viewed as a catalyst for change in
the city's schools, but close observers of Los Angeles Unified contend
that state-level reforms launched under Davis and Wilson also contributed
to the improvement.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from criticizing Davis on the stump, Riordan has targeted school
district administrations, saying he wants to "slash bureaucratic bloat."
His school finance plan would force districts to show precisely how much
money goes for teacher salaries, books and educational materials in
classrooms, and how schools spend the rest of their money. He contends
the process would make school finances more transparent to the public and
pressure districts to plow more of their funds directly into the
classroom.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan says that districts often waste funds that could be better
spent directly on students.</TE>
<TE>   But four leading school finance authorities--asked by The Times to
review the Riordan plan--described it as "simplistic" and
"ill-conceived."</TE>
<TE>   The experts say Riordan failed to consider spending outside classrooms
that directly affects students, including money for counselors, nurses,
cafeteria workers, custodians and bus drivers.</TE>
<TE>   "You need a lot more things beyond teachers compensation and
schoolbooks to educate children," said Lawrence Picus, a USC education
professor and director of the Center for Research in Education Finance.
"He's disingenuous in this proposal. He's implying that if it's not in
the classroom, it's waste."</TE>
<TE>   Both Jones and Simon also champion the idea of cutting spending on
wasteful educational bureaucracies. They both talk about creating "block
grants" that would send money directly to schools without interference by
outside administrators.</TE>
<TE>   But experts say all three candidates are perpetuating a myth when they
argue that administrative spending in the state's 1,000 school districts
is excessive.</TE>
<TE>   Just 5% of education dollars are spent on district-level
administration in California, according to EdSource, a nonprofit research
group that studies school finance and policy issues in the state. By
contrast, 94% of education funding is spent at school sites and in
classrooms for teacher salaries, aides, books, supplies and other
services, the organization reports.</TE>
<TE>   "The notion that all this money is being wasted because it's not being
spent in the classroom is totally without foundation," said Scott
Plotkin, executive director of the California School Boards Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Jones and Simon have proposed several other education initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   Jones wants to limit all school districts to 30,000 students, a plan
that would affect 32 school systems statewide and would require
legislation. The proposal would probably meet stiff resistance from
districts over issues of funding and racial segregation.</TE>
<TE>   Jones also wants to establish new teacher-training academies at
decommissioned military bases, where college students would earn
bachelor's degrees and teaching credentials. Their tuition would be
covered by the state in exchange for commitments to work in their
neighborhood schools for a minimum of six years. Jones says the academies
could produce about 4,000 new teachers a year.</TE>
<TE>   "There's only one component that matters: How do we get
better-educated children?" Jones said. "We're in a crisis in education.
The public expects us to deal with this aggressively."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Simon has proposed "10 commitments to make public
education work in California." He wants "every child" to read, write and
speak English by the third grade and to build "every school we need."
Simon also says that school superintendents would be held "professionally
accountable" for student achievement, and every campus would provide
child care before and after school.</TE>
<TE>   Simon doesn't say how he will pay for any of his proposals--or how
many children will be served by them--at a time when the state faces a
$12.4-billion shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the aspects of my education program is to empower teachers and
parents," he said. "The theme here is local control."</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>School Reform</TE>
<TE>Gov. Gray Davis and the three Republican gubernatorial candidates
have all made education a top priority in their campaigns. Davis
emphasizes his school-accountability system and teacher-training
initiatives. The Republican candidates emphasize traditional GOP
themes: They want to slash bureaucracies and give schools greater
control over spending and teaching.</TE>
<TE>   Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan</TE>
<TE>   Establish a school-financing plan that he says would put more
money in classrooms by cutting administrative spending.</TE>
<TE>   Pare the educational bureaucracy in Sacramento to a single agency.</TE>
<TE>   Allow big-city mayors to appoint local school board members and
school district superintendents.</TE>
<TE>   Create smaller schools that he believes are more conducive to
learning.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Bill Jones</TE>
<TE>   Establish academies at decommissioned military bases to train
teachers at state expense; in exchange, students would commit to
working in their neighborhood schools.</TE>
<TE>   Create school districts of no more than 30,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   Replace the state board of education and the state superintendent
of public instruction with regional boards and superintendents.</TE>
<TE>   Give state and federal money directly to schools in the form of
block grants, bypassing bureaucracies that traditionally distribute
the money.</TE>

<HD>Dam Leaves Some Residents High, Dry</HD>
<DH>China: Compensation falls short for those displaced by Three Gorges
project. As their way of life dies, so does their hope.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN FACKLER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LONGBAO, China
</DL>
<LD>Qin Feiyun dices greens with a cleaver in her restaurant, puts an
oiled wok on the gas stove and waits for customers who never come.</LD>
<LD>   Qin's family recently joined thousands of people forced to evacuate
homes in central China that will be flooded by the reservoir of the giant
Three Gorges Dam.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of high-rise housing projects were built to receive them. But
attempts to restart normal life are failing on their broad, empty
boulevards.</LD>
<TE>   "Nobody here has any money to buy things. The only thing that sells is
burglar bars" for apartment windows, Qin said.</TE>
<TE>   Demolition has begun of centuries-old cities and villages along the
Yangtze River that will be flooded by the world's largest hydroelectric
project. They are being replaced by rose of white or yellow apartment
complexes springing up on hilltops that will soon form the shore of a
vast new reservoir.</TE>
<TE>   More than 395,000 people have been moved, and China plans to relocate
another 130,000 before closing off the Yangtze in June 2003.</TE>
<TE>   All told, 1.13 million people must be resettled before the reservoir
reaches its full length of 411 miles in 2009.</TE>
<TE>   Most people will be moved to new cities and villages above the
reservoir's crest. But 125,000 are to be transplanted to areas as distant
as Shanghai and the far western region of Xinjiang.</TE>
<TE>   The scale of the $5-billion relocation is vast even for a country that
has long shifted large populations to build water projects.</TE>
<TE>   Emperors carved canals across China's richest farmland. Since the
communists took over in 1949, more than 10 million people have been moved
to make way for 80,000 reservoirs.</TE>
<TE>   "Moving millions of people is all in a day's work if it's in the name
of advancing China's position in the world," said Vaclav Smil, an expert
on China's water projects at the University of Manitoba in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   But never has a Chinese water project generated as much public
controversy as the $25-billion Three Gorges Dam. Critics complain of
widespread human rights abuses, such as villagers moved out by force and
with inadequate compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Resettled people have complained in petitions to Beijing. Violence
erupted last August, when as many as 1,000 villagers displaced to the
central province of Hunan scuffled with police while protesting the size
of compensation payments.</TE>
<TE>   Dam officials admit there have been problems. But they say the
payments, which are administered by local governments and vary widely,
are enough to buy a new home as big as the one lost.</TE>
<TE>   And they say relocation has an additional benefit: the chance to raise
living standards in a region where average incomes per person are about
$250 a year. In one fell swoop, they can move people now living in
primitive conditions into modern apartments with hot showers and indoor
toilets.</TE>
<TE>   "The dam has brought inconveniences, but it has also brought money to
a poor region that would never have been able to attract it otherwise,"
said Wang Jiazhu, deputy general manager of the China Yangtze Three
Gorges Project Development Corp., the state-owned company building the
dam.</TE>
<TE>   Ask those who have already been moved into the new housing projects,
and they agree their new apartments are more comfortable. But they also
tell of dysfunctional communities that threaten to become slums under the
weight of widespread unemployment and a painful sense of loss.</TE>
<TE>   Qin, the 30-year-old restaurant owner, and her husband, Qin Wanyun,
have a 5-year-old son and received $1,375 in resettlement compensation.</TE>
<TE>   They spent that--plus their entire $750 savings--to buy a modern
two-bedroom apartment in Longbao, a housing project 40 minutes outside
their former home of Wanzhou, a city in the central region of Chongqing.</TE>
<TE>   Qin, who had been forced to abandon a thriving restaurant, opened a
new one. She named it Wanyun after her husband. But she doesn't earn
enough even to pay its monthly rent of $18.</TE>
<TE>   Her family has run out of money, and her husband hasn't found work
since getting laid off last year from a state-run plastics factory.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way to make a living here," her husband said.</TE>
<TE>   The hardships of relocation fall even harder on older people,
especially in rural areas where family histories stretch back
generations.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to leave these streets," said 48-year-old shopkeeper Qin
Quehua of Shibao. "This is my world."</TE>

<HD>Musical Celebrating Diversity Plays Off Terror of Sept. 11</HD>
<DH>Arts: "The Immigrant" strikes a chord of brotherhood with the tale
of a Russian Jew forced to eke out a living selling fruit in Texas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT WELLER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>DENVER
</DL>
<LD>Like most Americans, Kimberly Grigsby wanted to do something to
help after Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The answer came two weeks later when she was handed the script to a
musical version of "The Immigrant," the story of a Russian Jew who fled
oppression and tried to make a living by selling bananas in rural Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Grigsby took a leave of absence from conducting the 12-person
orchestra of "The Full Monty" on Broadway, and now is at the Denver
Center for the Performing Arts, leading an ensemble for this musical
remake of a play that premiered here in 1985.</LD>
<TE>   "I do shows. So this is what I could do. It moved me. The time was
right for this story to be told," said Grigsby.</TE>
<TE>   The time was right because, in the words of playwright Mark Harelik,
"We as a nation are experiencing massive alternating waves of fear and
loathing of the stranger and pride in diversity."</TE>
<TE>   For Harelik, writing the play--he played the parts of his grandfather
and father in the first production--"was a valentine to my family. I am
deeply moved by the idea that some believe it is more important to do it
after Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   The musical received rave reviews during a three-week run at the
98-seat CAP21 in New York last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the show should have a long, long life. It is why we came to
the United States. It is what we are fighting for," said Frank Ventura,
artistic director of New York's Collaborative Arts Project.</TE>
<TE>   "The Immigrant" was the first production in CAP21's new theater. This
was to be its first full production season, plans that had to be canceled
because funding collapsed after the terrorist attacks. Its development
work, the kind that led to production of "The Immigrant," continues.</TE>
<TE>   "The Immigrant" may have been one of the safer bets CAP21 has made at
its Blackjack Theater Festival.</TE>
<TE>   From the moment the play was first produced there was talk of making
it a musical. The transition has worked well. The New York Times said of
the workshop production, "a deeply satisfying new musical, with much on
its mind about history, humanity, man and God and the American Dream, is
beckoning to theatergoers with a taste for rich characters in a tale that
touches the heart, glows with humor and soothes the ear."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the dialogue is sung--all this while retaining much of the
intensity of the play, the most-produced in the nation in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a couple of people telling me this was something new. It is
almost like an extension of the form," said lyricist Sarah Knapp. "We
wanted the music to carry the story. We wanted it to seem like the music
was coming out of the actors, not placed on them." She collaborated with
husband Steve Alper, who wrote the music.</TE>
<TE>   Grigsby, whose usual enthusiastic direction was visible to those near
the front, agreed. "Music should be a character," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Harelik said there is more than a little irony in the fact that the
play about immigrant Jews might make life a little easier for Arabs. An
Arab arriving in small-town America today would be no less strange than a
Jew hustling bananas in rural Texas near the turn of the century.</TE>
<TE>   "They are both Semitic people. There is a certain physical similarity
you will find."</TE>
<TE>   The story takes up about where "Fiddler on the Roof" leaves off.
Harelik's grandfather has come to the U.S., but instead of passing
through Ellis Island ends up in Texas as part of the Galveston Movement.
Philanthropist Jacob Henry Schiff financed the immigration of 10,000
Eastern European Jews between 1907 and 1914.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the four members of the CAP21 production came to Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Heller, in "A Class Act" on Broadway and in the national tour of
"Titanic," is the newcomer and brings an enthusiasm that almost bowls
over the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Walter Charles, who appeared on Broadway in "Kiss Me Kate" and "La
Cage Aux Folles," plays Milton, the stern banker who can't resist
befriending Harelik. His powerful performance makes his appearance at the
end in a wheelchair, unable to mumble more than a goodbye that is too
late for Harelik to hear, even more dramatic.</TE>
<TE>   Cass Morgan, who appeared on Broadway in "Capeman," "Beauty and the
Beast" and "Pump Boys and Dinettes," plays Milton's wife, Ima, a
Christian. She seems bewildered when she finds out Harelik is a Jew, but
also cannot resist extending the hand of friendship. She brings some
humor, especially when she takes a sip of wine during a Sabbath ceremony.
Tears flow when she berates her recently deceased husband for refusing to
be baptized, only to wail that she doesn't want to go to heaven if he
won't be there.</TE>
<TE>   Randal Myler, who directed the play, also directs the musical. He was
nominated for a Tony for writing "It Ain't Nothing But the Blues" and
wrote "Love Janis," based on letters Janis Joplin wrote to her sister.</TE>
<TE>   His direction is helped by Ralph Funicello's spare set, and landscapes
of the region's rolling plains painted by Texas artist Carl Rice Embrey
help retain the documentary style of the play.</TE>
<TE>   The show runs through Feb. 23 in Denver before moving to the Cocoanut
Grove Playhouse in Miami, and the producers hope to get it to Broadway.</TE>

<DL>LANCASTER, Ohio
</DL>
<LD>Larry Wayne Harris stands in his second bedroom holding a rack of
test tubes.</LD>
<LD>   "These are the active cultures that I use," he says proudly, ticking
off the contents of each glass vial. "Staphylococcus aureus,
Enterococcus, E. coli, Bacillus cereus.</LD>
<LD>   "Also, if I need it. . . . " he adds, squeezing between the bed and a
chest of drawers.</LD>
<TE>   Harris pulls a vial out of a dormitory-size fridge and holds it
between thumb and forefinger. He peers at it though his reading glasses,
his Santa Claus beard spreading over his chest like a bib.</TE>
<TE>   It is anthrax, albeit a harmless form used for inoculating livestock
against the disease.</TE>
<TE>   "It cannot make you sick, nor can it be made to make you sick," Harris
says reassuringly.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing about Harris' small wood-frame house, neatly planted
in a modest suburban neighborhood of minivans and chain-link fences, to
suggest the presence of live anthrax bacteria inside. Even in his bedroom
laboratory, there are just a few scientific accouterments, none very
sophisticated. His lab bench is an old bedroom vanity. His supply closet
is an armoire. The centrifuge on the dresser might look familiar to
anybody who took high school biology in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   This tiny home lab could never produce anything like the high-grade
anthrax that started turning up at news organizations and in Capitol Hill
mailboxes last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, federal agents investigating the mail attacks have taken a
keen interest in Harris and anybody remotely like him. An FBI profile in
November described a loner with "access to some laboratory equipment" who
"has a scientific background, or at least a strong interest in science."</TE>
<TE>   That's Harris. And to a greater or lesser extent, the FBI profile
describes a surprisingly robust network of people like him.</TE>
<TE>   These are citizen-scientists who conduct their experiments outside of
the big institutions--universities, pharmaceutical companies and
government laboratories--that control biological research today. They
vary greatly in academic credentials and their access to sophisticated
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Some don't have college degrees; others have PhDs and experience
directing university laboratories.</TE>
<TE>   Some perform their experiments in basements, spare bedrooms and rented
offices in suburban office parks. They use secondhand equipment, modified
kitchenware, whatever they can scrounge up with their own money or
donations.</TE>
<TE>   A select few have their own research institutes, and in some cases
they have even attracted federal funding by circumventing the process the
government uses to dole out research money. But their theories and goals
are dismissed, and sometimes even discredited, by the scientific
establishment.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't always this way. For centuries, amateurs were the backbone
of science. The founder of microbiology, Anton van Leeuwenhoek, was a
Dutch fabric salesman who enjoyed making optical instruments out of glass
lenses that he ground himself. One of his inventions was the first
microscope. He used it to explore previously unimaginable worlds in drops
of pond water, leaves, even his own body fluids. In plaque taken from the
mouths of old men he found "an unbelievably great company of living
animalcules. . . . All the water . . . seemed to be alive."</TE>
<TE>   Leeuwenhoek had discovered bacteria. It was 1683.</TE>
<TE>   More than three centuries later, the opportunities for a lone,
untrained amateur to make a major discovery appear to be long gone. Now
that the basic discoveries have been made, it takes millions, or even
billions, of dollars to pursue unanswered questions such as mapping the
human genome. Science has grown so big that even the most revered Nobel
Prize winner is only a small part of an enormous research establishment</TE>
<TE>   Still, the do-it-yourselfers persist. Some have dreams of miracle
cures and billion-dollar patents. Others pursue wild conspiracy theories.
A few, including Harris, have even dabbled in chemical or biological
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   He once tried to use somebody else's credentials to mail-order the
organism that causes bubonic plague. He said he needed the bacteria to do
research for his book, a guide to biological warfare defense.</TE>
<TE>   Harris might have succeeded if he hadn't called the biological
supplier a few days later to inquire about his shipment. The employee who
took his call at the American Tissue and Culture Collection in Rockville,
Md., became suspicious and notified authorities. The day after the
bacteria arrived at Harris' Ohio home, so did a swarm of federal agents.
He eventually pleaded guilty to wire fraud and was sentenced to 18
months' probation.</TE>
<TE>   The incident also got Harris kicked out of the American Society for
Microbiology (which doesn't require academic credentials for membership).
He is the only person ever expelled by the organization.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, Harris was involved in another dust-up with federal
officials. In February 1998, federal agents learned that he was in Las
Vegas, proclaiming that he had enough anthrax to wipe out the entire
city. The FBI arrested Harris and William Job Leavitt, another amateur
scientist, and towed Leavitt's Mercedes off in a sheath of plastic.</TE>
<TE>   Officials later determined that Harris had only the harmless type of
the bacterium used to vaccinate farm animals.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, Harris said, he inoculated himself and his dogs
with an anthrax vaccine that is federally regulated for animal use.</TE>
<TE>   "I injected it just under my skin, and I got a little red circle and
after that was gone I was safe," he said.</TE>
<TE>   An FBI agent in the region said the agency is familiar with Harris and
is "taking appropriate actions."</TE>
<TE>Some Potential Threats</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Stern, a Harvard University bioterrorism expert familiar with
Harris, thinks he's harmless. "I don't think he would actually do
anything," she said. But she's not so sure about some of the other
do-it-yourselfers.</TE>
<TE>   When she first heard about the high-quality anthrax sent to South
Dakota Sen. Tom Daschle's Capitol Hill office, Stern said, she thought
immediately of James Dalton Bell.</TE>
<TE>   The MIT-trained scientist might have been a prime suspect except for
one thing: He was locked up in a federal prison in Lompoc, serving a
10-year sentence for stalking two federal agents.</TE>
<TE>   When agents investigating the stalking case raided Bell's house,
tucked on a quiet street in Vancouver, Wash., they found a basement lab
with dozens of chemicals. Among them: a toxic nerve agent and other
dangerous or deadly substances, according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   On his computer they found recipes for chemical weapons. Witnesses
told investigators that he had tried to use green beans to make botulinum
toxin. He had also boasted of making sarin gas, the agent used in a Tokyo
subway attack that killed 12 and sickened thousands, court records say.</TE>
<TE>   "James Dalton Bell is the model of the lone wolf that the FBI worries
most about," Stern said. "Someone who is technically proficient, who has
it in for the government."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Leahy is another. Police searched Leahy's home in 1996 after he
shot his stepson in the face with a pistol (the boy survived). They
discovered an arsenal of chemical and biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy had mixed nicotine with a solvent that allowed it to penetrate
skin, enabling him to deliver a lethal dose with a few spritzes from a
spray bottle. He had also produced a small amount of ricin, a lethal
toxin derived from castor beans. Authorities said it was enough to kill
more than 100 people.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy is now in prison, serving an eight-year term for the shooting,
to be followed by 6 1/2 years for possessing dangerous materials.</TE>
<TE>Ideas Shared on Internet</TE>
<TE>   No one knows how many do-it-yourself biologists exist. But like most
once invisible subcultures, they now share theories, results and concerns
on the Internet. A few have even been accused of using the Internet to
subvert traditional scientific peer review.</TE>
<TE>   For example, former University of Texas cancer researcher Garth
Nicolson shows up frequently on Internet bulletin boards devoted to the
Gulf War Syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   Nicolson now runs his own private research laboratory, the Institute
for Molecular Medicine in Huntington Beach. The lab, with a sign out
front, sits in a quiet business park with wide streets and sprawling
parking lots. Inside, dozens of bustling scientists in lab coats work
with more than $1 million worth of centrifuges, filters, homogenizers,
incubators, mixers, sterilizers and other sophisticated equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Nicolson's laboratory makes money by testing hundreds of blood samples
each week for bacteria, minerals, proteins and other substances. The lab
also attracts contributions from private donors, mostly to fund research
into a process to detect low levels of bubonic plague in blood samples.
The institute's IRS forms don't name the private donors, but report that
the nonprofit organization gets more than $1 million in contributions a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the papers published by the laboratory's 40 researchers
involve cancer metastasis, a subject Nicolson has studied for three
decades. But his studies of Gulf War illness have drawn the most
attention. Nicolson believes the mysterious symptoms some veterans of the
Persian Gulf War have are caused by infection with an obscure microbe
known as Mycoplasma fermentans, which he believes Iraq may have used as a
biological weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Epidemiologists who have studied Gulf War illness dismiss Nicolson's
hypothesis. Efforts to replicate his findings have failed. But because of
intense pressure from veterans' groups and other advocates who believe
Nicolson, the government has funded his research anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Another controversial Gulf War researcher, retired New Orleans
physician Dr. Edward Hyman, recently procured $3.5 million in federal
funding for his Louisiana Medical Foundation by appealing to his
congressman, Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., who chairs the House
Appropriations Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Other do-it-yourself scientists haven't been so fortunate. Jay Chaplin
and his colleagues at the nonprofit Institute for Applied Biomedicine
have developed an innovative concept for an AIDS drug. But because they
are wary about turning over the rights to their research to a for-profit
biotechnology company or university, most of their funding comes from
raffles, wine-tastings and bowl-a-thons.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to take time, but in the end we're quite confident this
is going to be an important drug," said Sherrie McMahon, operations
director at the institute.</TE>
<TE>   The odds are long. In the era of biotechnology, major advances are
almost never made outside the university, government and corporate
laboratories of the scientific establishment. Except for those whose
experiments with dangerous substances attract the attention of law
enforcement, most do-it-yourself biologists are destined for obscurity.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Rangers Carry Out Time-Tested Strategies</HD>
<DH>Military: Today's combat bible stems from philosophy of British
Maj. Robert Rogers, who pioneered woodland warfare in 1757.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS CAROLA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>FORT EDWARD, N.Y.
</DL>
<LD>"Don't never take a chance you don't have to," today's U.S. Army
Rangers are taught.</LD>
<LD>   And: "Let the enemy come till he's almost close enough to touch. Then
let him have it and jump out and finish him up with your hatchet."</LD>
<LD>   It's not quite the way Maj. Robert Rogers put it in 1757, when muskets
and tomahawks were the weapons of choice and the leader of Rogers'
Rangers wrote a guideline for woodlands warfare. But Rogers' philosophy
remains the combat catechism for U.S. Army Rangers and other special
forces, including those fighting the war against terrorism in
Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   The modern Rangers' No. 1 rule--"Don't forget nothing"--is a
boiled-down version of the first of Rogers' 28 original orders, since
edited, abridged and retrofitted into the 19 rules learned by today's
Army commandos.</TE>
<TE>   The original rule started: "All Rangers are to be subject to the rules
and articles of war; to appear at roll-call every evening, on their own
parade, equipped, each with a firelock, 60 rounds of powder and ball, and
a hatchet. . . . "</TE>
<TE>   The rules cover everything from when to attack, sleep and eat to how
to handle a captured enemy. They're just as useful today in the mountains
of Tora Bora as they were 245 years ago, military experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "The principles of security, how you carry yourself on a patrol, those
do not change," said Lt. Col. David Pound, executive officer of the
Army's Ranger Training Brigade at Ft. Benning, Ga. "The close combat
lessons that Rogers learned in the 1700s are just as applicable today."</TE>
<TE>   Rogers' rules appear in the handbook that today's soldiers are given
when they arrive at Ranger school, and are posted at battalion
headquarters, Pound said.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers wrote his rules here on an island in the Hudson River 45 miles
north of Albany. They made for a manual for fighting in North American
forests, where European tactics led to several British disasters during
the French and Indian War, fought from 1755-1763.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 200 years later they were resurrected in World War II by newly
created American Ranger units, including those that stormed the French
coast on D-Day. In the 1960s, the Green Berets incorporated Rogers' rules
into their training regimen.</TE>
<TE>   Army Col. David Hackworth, looking to imbue an esprit de corps in the
infantry battalion he commanded in Vietnam, required soldiers to carry
copies of the rules he had printed on pocket-sized laminated cards;
officers had to memorize the rules.</TE>
<TE>   "These basics are the first things that soldiers forget--keeping your
weapons clean, moving quietly, and so on," said Hackworth, one of the
nation's most decorated foot soldiers. "If you can remember these simple
rules, you can survive."</TE>
<TE>   Today, with Rangers in the news on several fronts--fighting in
Afghanistan and portrayed in the film "Black Hawk Down"--there's renewed
interest in their history and in Rogers, said JoAnne and Richard Fuller,
French and Indian War buffs from Ft. Edward.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers wrote his rules while bivouacked on a nearby island named after
him. History buffs and Rogers aficionados--including former American and
British commandos--sometimes arrive looking for the spot they consider
"hallowed ground," Richard Fuller said.</TE>
<TE>   Raised in New Hampshire in the 1740s, Rogers honed his skills roaming
the Abenaki Indian trails of northern New England. In the 1750s, he
recruited "ranging companies" made up of trappers and frontiersmen to
scout and fight for the British.</TE>
<TE>   Better suited for the region's tangled wilderness than their more
encumbered allies, Rogers' men became so adept at guerrilla-style combat
tactics favored by their Indian foes that the French placed bounties on
the major and his Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   But several of his forays nearly ended in disaster, with the Rangers
suffering scores of dead, wounded and captured while Rogers made narrow
escapes. After years of personal and financial problems, he died a pauper
in England in 1795.</TE>
<TE>   Hackworth said Rogers should be forgiven for his personal failures
considering the fighting doctrine he bequeathed to future generations of
soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "That guy has saved more lives than the smartest general," he said.</TE>

<HD>Lobbyists' Business Booming in D.C.</HD>
<DH>Politics: Recession and terrorist attacks fail to put a lasting
dent in the need to keep tabs on Capitol Hill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWARD WALSH</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Haley Barbour, in partnership with about three dozen other
high-powered Washington lobbyists, owns a piece of a restaurant in
downtown Washington. In the week after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
business at the Caucus Room fell by almost 75% from the week before.</LD>
<LD>   But by the end of October, business was back to 90% of normal, and now
it is booming, said Barbour, a former chairman of the Republican National
Committee.</LD>
<LD>   The rapid recovery of the restaurant could serve as a metaphor for the
main occupation of its lobbyist-owners. The economy is in recession, and
the economic downturn was exacerbated by the aftershocks of the terrorist
attacks. But while hard times have caused companies in some sectors of
the economy to reduce their Washington lobbying, lobbying firms overall
continue to flourish, according to several veteran lobbyists.</LD>
<TE>   Technology and telecommunications firms are among those that have been
hurt most by the economic slide. As a result, some companies have cut
back on their lobbying, said Edward Black, president of the Computer &amp;
Communications Industry Assn.</TE>
<TE>   But, Black added, "it's definitely not across the board. . . . There
are some companies that lost 80% of their value in the market that
nonetheless made decisions to retain their Washington presence."</TE>
<TE>   For some companies, the decision on whether to cut back is easy. "When
you have billions of dollars at stake, what's a couple of million dollars
in lobbying?" Black asked. He cited the case of a telecommunications firm
that is seeking a crucial decision from the Federal Communications
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "Without [FCC] approval, they don't have a business," he said. "With
it, they think they have a great business. They're not going to stop"
lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   There is a paradoxical relationship between the health of the economy
and the role of Washington lobbyists, noted Tom Korologos of Timmons &amp;
Co., a lobbying firm. "Traditionally, when things go bad in the economy,
corporate America turns to us for help," he said. "When things are going
swimmingly, it's, 'Why do we need those Washington guys?' "</TE>
<TE>   Lobbying is also driven by the Washington agenda, regardless of the
economic climate. "Health care is always going to be there," Korologos
said. "Another is transportation. What is the Hill going to do? Is there
going to be a trade bill? Then everybody who's involved in trade runs up
there. The agenda is driven by what goes on in the Capitol."</TE>
<TE>   Barbour and others said the public relations and public affairs
consulting firms, which often work closely with lobbyists, have been hurt
more by the economy than straight lobbying operations. "P.R. is one of
the first things that corporate executives look at for budget cuts," said
Nels Olson, head of the government affairs section at Korn/Ferry
International, an executive recruiting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Jody Powell, chairman of Powell Tate, a public affairs and crisis
communications company, said that after Sept. 11, "people were just
frozen. They were distracted."</TE>
<TE>   Even before the attacks, Powell said, there was a noticeable slowdown
of business with high-tech companies. That was followed by what he
described as the inevitable "second hit from your receivables." "People
who are slow to pay go from slow pay to no pay," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the future, Powell said, "the expectations are positive. What
is lacking is a whole lot of tangible proof that those expectations are
going to become reality."</TE>
<TE>   R. Bruce Josten, executive vice president for government affairs at
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that in an economic downturn, smaller
companies tend to be the first to pull back their Washington lobbying.
But he said there is a permanence to the clash of economic interests in
the nation's capital that makes the lobbyist a part of the natural
landscape.</TE>
<TE>   He cited the long-running battle over possible telecommunications
legislation that has led to an expensive battle between competing
companies. "They're not going to stop," Josten said. "There's too much at
stake. Whatever they are spending, it's kind of chump change, compared to
what's at stake."</TE>
<TE>   Josten also notes that "there are no permanent victories" in the
capital: "This is a town where if you are not in the game, chances are
you are going to be taken advantage of."</TE>

<HD>Coast Guard 911 System Riddled With Dead Zones</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Coast Guard's 911 system has at least 88 coverage gaps where
rescuers cannot hear or locate distressed boaters who radio for help, a
government investigation found. The dead areas--sprinkled among 19 states
and U.S. territories--range from Kodiak, Alaska, to Key West, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-year-old National Distress and Response System, the Coast
Guard's primary short-range communications network, monitors the distress
frequency--the maritime version of 911--and coordinates search-and-rescue
missions.</LD>
<LD>   The system includes about 300 antennas mounted on towers at high
elevations. They are linked to 44 communication centers, where Coast
Guard personnel monitor distress calls on inland waterways and along the
coast.</LD>
<TE>   Dead zones constitute a serious safety problem, said spokesman Jim
McPherson. Boaters who can't get through must rely on other means of
communication, such as flares, mayday calls to other boaters, or
emergency positioning systems that use satellites, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Guard has been working on a plan to upgrade the emergency
system, but the latest version has significant shortcomings,
Transportation Department Inspector General Kenneth Mead said. It still
leaves coverage gaps, though probably smaller than now.</TE>
<TE>   In the current system, the 88 gaps total 24,725 square miles, or about
14% of the total coverage area. They range in size from 7 square miles to
more than 1,840.</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Guard maintains that the revised plan would result in
important improvements, including reducing most search areas down to 5 to
10 square miles and eliminating most of the gaps.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Senate Appropriations transportation subcommittee who
heard about the revised plan Thursday were skeptical. "Why would we buy a
system that has coverage gaps?" asked Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, the
top Republican on the subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Guard pegs the cost of the revised plan at $580 million.</TE>

<HD>Exhibit Offers Proof Poachers Should Hang Their Heads</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Mounted 'trophies' of illegally hunted animals are part
of a touring show on the extent of abuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY D. MAY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HARRISBURG, Pa.
</DL>
<LD>The deer hunter had never seen anything like it: a set of elk
antlers with a six-foot spread and branches as thick as baseball bats.</LD>
<LD>   It was mounted on a wall in the lobby of the Pennsylvania Game
Commission's headquarters as part of an exhibit that showcases the
infamous trophies seized during investigations of some of Pennsylvania's
more notorious poaching cases.</LD>
<LD>   Printed on an 8 1/2-by-11-inch sheet of laminated paper were the
vitals. The rack belonged to an enormous bull elk illegally killed in
October 2000 in Cameron County. The animal was known to many in the area
because of the majesty of its crown.</LD>
<TE>   The shooter left it where it fell. Elk were off-limits for hunting at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sickening," said Steve Lear, an office-machine repairman who
hunts whitetail deer and game birds.</TE>
<TE>Bear Shot Inside Its Den</TE>
<TE>   As he knelt before the dubious prize, he couldn't help but question
the injustice of such a kill.</TE>
<TE>   "It's upsetting to see there are people out there . . . who just do it
for the killing."</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife conservation officers are still trying to arrest the person
who shot the animal.</TE>
<TE>   The head and hide of a 525-pound black bear is also included in the
exhibit, called the "Wall of Shame." The animal was shot illegally inside
its den in Huntingdon County in 1998. Two men paid $2,000 in fines.</TE>
<TE>   A black bear weighing a record 800 pounds and measuring 8 feet in
length is displayed standing on three of its legs. The 19-year-old animal
was shot near a gun range in Lycoming County by a West Virginia man and
his two sons. They were fined a total of $3,600 for illegally taking the
animal out of season.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit was created by Barry Leonard, a wildlife conservation
officer. It will be on display through late February, then will travel
around the state to various sportsmen's shows.</TE>
<TE>   Absent from the exhibit are the poachers' names.</TE>
<TE>   "The individual isn't necessarily the issue. It's the crime itself,"
explains Jerry Feaser, a spokesman for the game commission.</TE>
<TE>   The display is modeled on a similar one in Maryland, Leonard says.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is to allow the sportsmen to see something tangible that's
being stolen from them . . . to get across the magnitude of what does
actually happen out there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The trophies are the result of investigations in the state's
south-central region, but are "typical of the kinds of things we see
happening all over the state," Leonard said. Common violations include
"jacklighting," or hunting with lights at night, killing animals out of
season and exceeding bag limits.</TE>
<TE>   The commission doesn't keep annual figures on the numbers of deer or
bear killed illegally. It does, however, track elk because they were
protected until November, when the commission allowed a limited elk
hunt--the first in 70 years.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen elk were killed illegally in the last three years: six in
1999, five in 2000 and three last year.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 7,500 arrests were made last year alone for violations of the
state's Game and Wildlife Code, resulting in more than 1,000 people
losing their hunting or trapping privileges. Commission officials said
those numbers have remained steady over the past few years.</TE>
<TE>Hunters Urged to Report Poachers</TE>
<TE>   Leonard said he hopes the display will encourage hunters who follow
the rules to remain vigilant about reporting lawbreakers, even though
some poachers never seem to get the message.</TE>
<TE>   An entire section of the exhibit--nearly a dozen sets of deer antlers
and a handsome mounted buck head--displays trophies taken from an Altoona
poacher who officials said showed no remorse after he was caught.</TE>
<TE>   "When the fall rolled around, this guy was like a buck in rut; he got
the urge to go out and hunt, and he'd go when he wanted--at night,
whatever," said William E. Anderson, a special agent with the U.S. Fish &amp;
Wildlife Service who worked with the commission on the case.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd shoot with a .22 [caliber rifle], with a bow," Anderson said.
"And he was doing all this while his license was already in revocation."</TE>
<TE>   The 36-year-old man was convicted of 48 game-code violations,
resulting in $14,200 in fines and the revocation of his hunting
privileges until 2056.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is just the tip of the iceberg--the ones they were able
to catch," said Randy Geist, who visited the exhibit. "I bet there's a
lot more out there."</TE>

<HD>Rebuilding the House Where Washington Slept</HD>
<DH>History: Once-forgotten headquarters where America's first
president plotted Revolutionary War strategies in 1777 is on the
restoration trail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL RUBINKAM</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HARTSVILLE, Pa.
</DL>
<LD>The centuries were not kind to Moland House, a stone farmhouse
George Washington used as his headquarters for a brief but significant
period in the summer of 1777.</LD>
<LD>   Though listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the
Georgian-style house was close to demolition by the mid-1990s--an
abandoned eyesore often targeted by vandals.</LD>
<LD>   There appeared to be little hope of saving it. But a dedicated group
of volunteers is determined to do just that.</LD>
<TE>   After six years, $650,000 and countless volunteer hours, Moland House
is well on its way to becoming a museum showpiece--a restored gem
reflecting its place in history.</TE>
<TE>   "It is significant that the building still exists, because so many of
the others [that Washington used] haven't survived," said Frank E.
Grizzard Jr., a University of Virginia scholar who has edited several
volumes of Washington's papers.</TE>
<TE>   Moland House became Washington's headquarters from Aug. 10-23, 1777, a
few weeks before the Battles of Brandywine and Germantown. It was here
that the Marquis de Lafayette joined the American Revolution and
Washington received Casimir Pulaski, who became the father of the
American cavalry.</TE>
<TE>   The house, circa 1750, is about 20 miles north of Philadelphia, site
of the third-longest encampment of Washington's army in Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   Its physical deterioration was staggering to those who knew its
history.</TE>
<TE>   "The house was broken open, all the windows were knocked out, vandals
had set fires, and the weeds were eight or 10 feet high," said Warren
Williams, the 80-year-old president of the Warwick Township Historical
Society.</TE>
<TE>   The house also had undergone significant renovations and additions in
the 1800s and 1940s and did not resemble the structure used by
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The volunteers' first big break came in 1996, when a developer who
planned to demolish Moland House instead gave it to Warwick Township. The
township entered into a 15-year management agreement with the historical
society, which began raising money to restore the house to the way it
looked in Washington's day.</TE>
<TE>   There is little doubt that Washington stayed in the house of Catherine
Moland, widow of a prominent lawyer and British loyalist named John
Moland. Washington himself indicated in his account book that he paid
Mrs. Moland more than five pounds for use of the house, and another pound
to the "woman for cleaning the kitchen."</TE>
<TE>   The house was the finest in the area, situated near a creek and
surrounded by sympathetic settlers. It had a kitchen and two other
first-floor rooms that Washington used as an office and reception area,
and two bedrooms on the second floor.</TE>
<TE>   Lafayette, a wealthy 19-year-old Frenchman who became a major general
in the American army, arrived Aug. 19, 1777. He called his initial
discussion with Washington "the great conversation," and he became a
trusted aide to the commander in chief.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 21, Washington convened a war council of top generals and
plotted his next move against British Gen. William Howe. On Aug. 23,
Washington and his troops broke camp and prepared to defend Philadelphia
against Howe's troops, who were marching from the south.</TE>
<TE>   Moland House's place in American history is what attracted Mary
DeNadai, the architect in charge of the restoration.</TE>
<TE>   "We are so fortunate to have this opportunity to touch the space that
reflected an incredible amount of history," said DeNadai, a partner in
John Milner Associates, a firm specializing in historic preservation.
"I'm always in awe when I go there."</TE>
<TE>   Moland House, also known as Headquarters Farm, is no longer in danger,
though the interior remains a shell and the historical society is about
$400,000 short of its fund-raising goal.</TE>
<TE>   The exterior renovation is largely finished. Workers replaced several
windows, reinforced the original rafters, restored the chimney and
installed a new roof of yellow pine shingles. The weeds were cleared and
trees planted. An amateur archeology group has excavated the original
cellar entrance and a modern porch will be torn down.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the house, workers removed the 1940s wood paneling to reveal
thick stone walls and remnants of the original plaster. They also
discovered an original stone sink--complete with a small opening in the
wall so water could drain to the outside--as well as a hearth with room
for eight cooking fires.</TE>
<TE>   The house still lacks plumbing, electrical and fire-protection systems
and the walls need to be plastered. (The architect plans to incorporate
the original plaster pieces.) The 1940s wood floor will be replaced with
hand-hewn antique pine.</TE>
<TE>   The portion of the house where Washington had his headquarters
ultimately will be furnished with period pieces, most likely replicas.
Newer sections of the house will get modern renovations and will be used
as office and meeting space for the historical society.</TE>
<TE>   The public should get its first look at Moland House in 2003 or 2004.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>A woman's preference for one man's scent over another's is
influenced by genes she inherited from her father, a new study suggests.
One researcher said scent may play some role in choosing friends and even
mates.</LD>
<LD>   In the study, 49 unmarried women sniffed the contents of boxes, each
of which had a different scent. They weren't told that some scents came
from T-shirts, each worn by one of six men. Women were asked which scent
they would prefer if they had to smell it all the time.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers also studied a sampling of MHC genes--which are key to
the immune system--in the women and in the men who'd donated their scent.
They separated out the MHC genes each woman inherited from dad--the
paternal MHC genes--versus those from mom.</LD>
<TE>   Analysis found that, in general, each woman's favorite male scent, as
compared to her least-favorite one, came from a man with more similarity
to her own paternal MHC genes. There was no such relationship to genes
inherited from the mother.</TE>
<TE>   The work is reported in the February issue of the journal Nature
Genetics by researchers at the University of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Study co-author Martha McClintock noted that female mice seek MHC
similarities when they pick other females to share in cooperative rearing
of their offspring. The new study suggests people might be unconsciously
influenced by odor in choosing their friends too, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The new lab work didn't focus on mate choice or how sexy the women
found the odors to be. But McClintock said a previous study found people
were less likely than one would expect by chance to marry a person with
highly similar MHC genes. That finding and the new work suggests odor may
play a role in choosing mates, McClintock said.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly that's not going to be the only thing," she said. But it
could be a means of avoiding people with very high MHC similarity, or a
very low one. A very high similarity could indicate a risk of inbreeding
and miscarriage, while a low similarity might indicate the potential mate
has unfavorable genes, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Potts, a biologist at the University of Utah who studies MHC
genes, cautioned against drawing conclusions about human behavior in
ordinary life from the artificial setting of a lab experiment.</TE>
<TE>   After all, he said, mice seek high MHC similarity in communal nest
neighbors but low similarity in their sexual mates. So if they show
preferences for certain smells in an experiment like McClintock's, it's
hard to tell what it means for their behavior, he said.</TE>

<HD>Mob Bosses Tend to Keep It All in the Family</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>The two bosses met in 1988, in a lower Manhattan apartment. Vincent
"The Chin" Gigante, swathed in a bathrobe and pajamas, sat and spoke with
fellow Mafioso John Gotti.</LD>
<LD>   After a brief business discussion, Gotti proudly told Gigante that his
son, John Jr., was now a made man.</LD>
<LD>   "Instead of congratulating him, Chin said, 'Geez, I'm sorry to hear
that,' " recalled Sammy "The Bull" Gravano in his biography, "Underboss."</LD>
<TE>   None of Chin's sons were in the mob, Gravano wrote, and he added: "I
wanted my son to be legitimate, to have nothing to do with what I did."</TE>
<TE>   Despite such protestations, authorities now say, both Gigante and
Gravano eventually brought their sons into the underworld--like
godfather, like son.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Gigante, 45, faces a new federal indictment on racketeering
charges for allegedly ferrying his father's orders from prison to the
hierarchy of the Genovese crime family. The "Chin" was accused of running
the powerful family from his cell.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 24-year-old Gerard Gravano pleaded guilty to federal drug
charges, receiving a 15-year jail sentence. The elder Gravano, once
underboss of the Gambino family, entered a guilty plea to the same
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   The unhappy endings were predictable. Going back to the mob
matriculation of Bill Bonanno in the early 1950s, the ascension of a mob
son inevitably leads to unmitigated disaster:</TE>
<TE>   * Carmine "The Snake" Persico was the proud father of Alphonse "Allie
Boy" Persico, who followed him as head of the Colombo family . . . and
then followed him into jail on racketeering charges. Both remain in
custody.</TE>
<TE>   * Raymond "Junior" Patriarca succeeded his father, Raymond L.S.
Patriarca, as the boss of the New England mob--and failed miserably.
Junior, who pleaded guilty to racketeering in 1991, "couldn't lead a
Brownie troop," said one New England mob expert.</TE>
<TE>   * John A. Gotti, son of the "Dapper Don" John Gotti, took over the
Gambino family from his old man before joining him in federal lockup.
John Sr. will die in jail; Junior is eligible for parole in September
2004. "You're not talking about a brain surgeon," an FBI official once
said of Junior.</TE>
<TE>   "Naturally, authorities are paying attention to these kids," says
organized crime expert Howard Abadinsky.</TE>
<TE>   A half-century ago, old-school mobsters steered their kids away from
the Mafia. The Chicago mob became particularly adroit at steering its
next generation into the legitimate world.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy "Three-Finger Brown" Luchese's son won an appointment to West
Point. Joe Bonanno wanted his eldest son, Bill, to become an attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Bill succumbed to the lure of the fast buck and was nearly
assassinated during the "Banana Wars" of the mid-1960s. He spent most of
the next two decades behind bars on a variety of charges.</TE>
<TE>   Carlo Gambino, a Bonanno contemporary, set up his sons Thomas and
Joseph with legitimate businesses in Manhattan's garment district.
Authorities alleged that Thomas was a capo in the family, but it took
them a long time to prove it: He was convicted of racketeering in 1993,
27 years after his father's death.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other godfathers' sons, Andrew Gigante made it through his
first 44 years as a model citizen. His only courtroom visits involved
pushing his father's wheelchair to the defense table at a 1997 trial.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his pristine record, the younger Gigante was jailed after a
prosecutor described him as a danger to the community and a flight risk.
Gigante pleaded not guilty to all charges in the case and was released on
$2.5-million bond.</TE>

<HD>A Medal Is His Lesser Triumph</HD>
<DH>Snowboarder: In 2000, bronze medalist Chris Klug feared he would
die awaiting liver transplant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDDIE PELLS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah
</DL>
<LD>Glad simply to be alive, let alone at the pinnacle of his sport,
liver transplant recipient Chris Klug put a whole new twist on the notion
of an Olympic miracle.</LD>
<LD>   Using duct tape to bind together a broken boot buckle for his final
race, Klug persevered and won the bronze medal Friday in parallel giant
slalom snowboarding.</LD>
<LD>   Philipp Schoch of Switzerland, the second-slowest rider in qualifying
Thursday, won the gold, and Sweden's Richard Richardsson took silver.</LD>
<TE>   Klug gave the United States its record 14th medal of the Winter Games
and pushed the story of his unbelievable comeback to a stunning
crescendo.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was going to die waiting," Klug said of the days before
his liver donor was found 19 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty scared," he said. "I wasn't thinking about snowboarding,
or coming back and winning a bronze medal. I was just thinking about
hoping to live, hanging out with my family and continuing with life as I
know it."</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, Klug's Olympic triumph was about more than sports. It
was about the miracle of modern medicine, one family's generosity and the
will to overcome adversity.</TE>
<TE>   Leisa Flood, the mother who made the choice to donate her 13-year-old
son's organs in July 2000, was overwhelmed when she heard of Klug's
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so grateful we were given the opportunity to help him," Flood
said from her Idaho home. "It makes me feel good. They both won."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, such an improbable comeback story deserves an improbable
ending, and Klug served that up too.</TE>
<TE>   During his first of two bronze-medal races against Nicolas Huet of
France, the buckle on Klug's back boot snapped. He didn't have time to
replace it between races, so he used some loose metal and duct tape from
his repair kit to "jerry-rig the thing up."</TE>
<TE>   At the starting gate, he felt the looseness in the boot and briefly
wondered if he could make it down the hill.</TE>
<TE>   Klug had been in tougher jams than this.</TE>
<TE>   "I just said, 'To heck with it,' " Klug said. ". . . I just made the
best of it."</TE>
<TE>   He won the race, won the bronze and celebrated by bouncing his fist
against his heart, then pointing to his father, his girlfriend and the
dozens of other overwhelmed friends and family who came to see him.</TE>
<TE>   Klug wants his story to send a message to the world "to get families
talking about organ donation," but said he never felt pressure to win to
make his ordeal worthwhile.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can do is relax, have fun, enjoy each turn and do the best I
can," he said.</TE>

<HD>Gulf War's Link to Disease Still Elusive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Gulf War has been over for more than a decade, but questions
about sick veterans linger. Nearly 199,000 veterans--or more than one in
four--who served in the Persian Gulf from August 1990 to July 1991 have
filed disability claims, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.</LD>
<LD>   "It's stunning," says Pat Eddington, author of "Gassed in the Gulf:
The Inside Story of the Pentagon-CIA Cover-Up of Gulf War Syndrome."</LD>
<LD>   Tens of thousands of Gulf veterans have complained of illnesses
including chronic muscle and joint pain, anxiety, fatigue and memory
loss--collectively called Gulf War Syndrome.</LD>
<TE>   But researchers have disagreed on the causes and even whether such a
syndrome exists.</TE>
<TE>   A study published in February in the British Medical Journal suggested
that unexplained illnesses experienced by some Gulf vets are not unique
and that they should be placed in a context of post-combat syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   But other researchers and veterans groups have blamed nerve gas,
pesticides and vaccines for some of the sicknesses.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Defense says there is a higher incidence of
illness among Gulf veterans compared with military personnel who were not
in the region at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   But "putting a label to that or having an explanation--we're not there
yet," says Austin Camacho, spokesman for the department's deployment
health support directorate.</TE>
<TE>   About $174 million has been spent on nearly 200 studies, but none has
found conclusive proof that any illnesses were directly caused by the
war, said Jim Benson, a VA spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The VA recently announced that a preliminary study found Gulf veterans
nearly twice as likely to develop ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, as other
military personnel. But the cause of the disease was not found.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.
</DL>
<LD>An illegal immigrant who helped two of the Sept. 11 hijackers get
illegal identification and falsely warned authorities of more attacks was
sentenced Friday to 21 months in prison.</LD>
<LD>   The misstatements--which the judge called bizarre--prompted alerts at
the highest levels of government and added security precautions on the
East Coast.</LD>
<LD>   The illegal immigrant from El Salvador pleaded guilty in December to
one count of document fraud, admitting he falsely certified that Hani
Hanjour and Khalid Almihdhar, hijackers on the flight that crashed into
the Pentagon, were Virginia residents. The hijackers paid him $100.</LD>
<TE>   In the days immediately after the attacks, Luis Martinez-Flores lied
to investigators, telling them he had conversations with Hanjour in which
Hanjour discussed attacks on Federal Reserve banks, stadiums and other
large buildings in Boston, Richmond, Va., and Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out that the only contact he had with the hijackers came on
Aug. 1, when they approached him outside a 7-Eleven and asked him for
help obtaining the ID cards.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor John Morton said the government is confident
Martinez-Flores had no knowledge of the hijackers' plans.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear why Martinez-Flores exaggerated his connections to the
hijackers.</TE>

<HD>Legless Quake Victim Helped to Stand Tall</HD>
<DH>Aid: U.S. family gives Salvadoran boy a chance to realize his
dreams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN SEEWER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>FINDLAY, Ohio
</DL>
<LD>Hector Castro isn't much different from other 12-year-old boys. He
loves basketball, swimming and fishing. And he wants to be tall.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to be very tall," Hector told the doctor who made his new
legs.</LD>
<LD>   Hector left his home in El Salvador to get artificial legs in the
United States. He was severely burned down his back and legs in an
earthquake that devastated his country a year ago. Doctors there had to
amputate both legs.</LD>
<TE>   His story has captivated countrymen who see him as a symbol of their
spirit to recover from the earthquake and a second temblor that killed
1,200 people and caused $1.6 billion in damage. Many in El Salvador hope
that if Hector can walk again, they too can rise above their losses.</TE>
<TE>   "He has been touching many, many hearts," says Nubia Arevalo, director
of Children's Wishing Star, a nonprofit group that helped bring Hector to
the United States to get artificial legs and learn how to walk with them.</TE>
<TE>   He arrived last April, and originally was to have stayed just through
the summer. But now he may be staying permanently.</TE>
<TE>   After he went home in December, his parents decided that trying to
walk on the hilly, rocky paths around their village would be too
difficult for their son. He has returned to stay with Don and Karen
Manley, owners of a nursing home who met Hector while they were in El
Salvador helping with the earthquake relief.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the best for him. We want our son to get ahead, because with our
poverty we can't help him," Hector's mother, Anabel Hernandez, said at
her home. "I think in his future he'll be in the United States. That's
the best thing for him."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't an easy decision. The Manleys say they didn't want to take
Hector away from his family. And Hector's family says they didn't want to
ask too much of the Manleys. After days of agonizing, they let him go.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the most loving thing I've seen in my life," Manley says. "I
can't imagine what they went through."</TE>
<TE>   Seeing Hector struggling to walk off the airplane with his new legs
when he arrived in El Salvador had to be bittersweet, Manley says.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure it was one of their happiest moments of his life, but I'm
sure it was one of the saddest. They had to know right away it wouldn't
work because he was struggling."</TE>
<TE>   Hector's mother said she always believed he would walk again. "I don't
have words to explain the happiness that was inside me when I saw my son
taking steps. I always told my son, 'Have faith, my son. You'll walk
again.' "</TE>
<TE>   Hector has been getting around on his new legs since August. His first
attempt ended in early June when he fell and broke a bone in his leg,
setting his progress back three months.</TE>
<TE>   "He's had to learn how to fall and how to get up off the floor,"
Manley says. "It's a long process. On flat surfaces he does wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Hector has forearm crutches to help him with balance. "It's going to
be years before he feels real comfortable," Manley says.</TE>
<TE>   The Manleys will send Hector to school in Findlay in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   For now, he's spending the winter with his surrogate parents at a
condominium they own in Naples, Fla., because immigration rules won't
allow him to attend school yet. His days are filled with tutoring in
English and other subjects, swimming and fishing.</TE>
<TE>   The Manleys, who have two married daughters and three grandchildren,
say Hector is considered part of their family.</TE>
<TE>   He also has captured many other hearts with his spirit and
determination.</TE>
<TE>   The children he met in Findlay welcomed him with open arms. Cleveland
Indians shortstop Omar Vizquel, a native of Venezuela, spent an hour
talking with Hector last summer.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to do whatever he wants," Manley says. "There's no
self-pity in him."</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press correspondent Marcos Aleman in San Salvador
contributed to this story.</TE>

<HD>Gulf War Pilot Trains Sights at Link to ALS</HD>
<DH>Health: Vet believes his military service may have led to Lou
Gehrig's disease. VA concedes the possibility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON COHEN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SOUTH WINDSOR, Conn.
</DL>
<LD>He has something to say, so he begins by slowly, deliberately,
blinking his eyes to spell each word, letter by letter.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Donnelly sits in his den, jokingly dubbed the "I love me
room," filled with mementos of his days as an Air Force fighter pilot.
His helmet and leather jacket. Pins from bombs he dropped. A thumbs-up
photo in his F-16, a jet so sleek it's called the Maserati of the sky.</LD>
<LD>   And rows of medals, of course, several for 44 combat missions he flew
in the Persian Gulf when he roared through the clouds and swooped down to
strike enemy targets.</LD>
<TE>   That was his world 11 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Today his world is his house, a wheelchair, a feeding tube, a
ventilator.</TE>
<TE>   At 43, Michael Donnelly has ALS, known as Lou Gehrig's disease, a
mysterious, relentless illness that has robbed him of his ability to
walk, talk, swallow, even breathe on his own.</TE>
<TE>   So he "speaks" with his eyes: He strings together words by blinking
when the appropriate letter is spoken.</TE>
<TE>   ALS has turned Donnelly's body into a prison, but it has not destroyed
his spirit or his determination. He and his family waged a five-year
battle to convince America's military that his illness is traceable to
his service in the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, some success.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Veterans Affairs recently announced that Gulf War
veterans were nearly twice as likely as other military personnel to
develop Lou Gehrig's disease--marking the first time it linked service in
the region to a specific illness. A tiny group of ALS veterans received
their first benefits this month.</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly's father, Tom, a blunt-spoken former Marine who is now a
lawyer, calls his son a hero.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Donnelly brushes aside such talk.</TE>
<TE>   "I am," he says, spelling with his eyelids, "just a regular guy in an
impossible situation."</TE>
<TE>   With his athletic good looks and cool confidence, Michael Donnelly
could have stepped out of a recruiting poster.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy, if you drew a picture of what an Air Force pilot would look
like, it would be him," says Ed Houle, Donnelly's former commanding
officer. "He was a great physical specimen, sharp as a tack, with a great
attitude."</TE>
<TE>   At 6-foot-2 with sandy blond hair, blue eyes and a thousand-watt Tom
Cruise-smile, he was a real-life "Top Gun." Type-A personality. Nerves of
steel. An air of invincibility.</TE>
<TE>   Once during the war, Donnelly says in his memoirs, "Falcon's Cry," he
tried to release 8,000 pounds of bombs strapped to his wings, but
something stuck. They wouldn't drop. Landing with live explosives, he
thought, is like skimming a crate of eggs across a driveway at 300 mph
without breaking a single one.</TE>
<TE>   But he did--without breaking a sweat. "It just wasn't my turn," he
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly--Big D in his squadron--loved being a combat pilot. The hum
of the radar warning, the shudder of the jet as bombs dropped, nothing
could beat that rush.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, everything changed.</TE>
<TE>   While a flight instructor at Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas,
Donnelly became ill. He had trouble breathing. His right leg began
dragging. In early 1996, he fell backward climbing a ladder to a jet.</TE>
<TE>   He never flew again.</TE>
<TE>   At first, a doctor said it probably was stress. Later that year,
Donnelly was diagnosed with ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a
neurological disease that progressively destroys motor neurons.</TE>
<TE>   Lou Gehrig's disease, named for the New York Yankees Hall of Famer
stricken with ALS, kills most people within two to five years. The cause
is unknown. There is no cure.</TE>
<TE>   And it is rare: About 5,000 people are diagnosed each year, most in
their 60s and 70s. Donnelly was diagnosed at 37, the age at which Gehrig
died.</TE>
<TE>   ALS is a slow-motion death. It paralyzes your muscles until you're
locked into your body, unable to communicate with the outside world. All
the while, your mind remains alert.</TE>
<TE>   And Donnelly's is.</TE>
<TE>   His gaze is intense, his wit sharp, his comments perceptive and
honest, even painfully so.</TE>
<TE>   He jokes about his beloved Boston Red Sox, follows the war news, and
downloads music, does his banking and shopping via computer (he can
manipulate a specially designed mouse command attached to his headrest.)</TE>
<TE>   "He's very present," says his sister, Denise. "He can still command a
room."</TE>
<TE>   But there's a cruelty in his very alertness. So many things he
loved--jogging, riding a dirt bike, flying, boating with his two kids,
now 14 and 10--are just memories in a photo album.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, this sucks," Donnelly says, looking at his wife, Susan,
his junior-high sweetheart. "Sometimes I give up. But always, I come
back."</TE>
<TE>   At first, Donnelly was determined to fight his illness.</TE>
<TE>   He went to a chemical sensitivity detoxification clinic, ate
macrobiotic foods and traveled to Germany, where a doctor claimed to have
cured people with multiple sclerosis. He even took fen-phen, the weight
loss drugs linked to heart problems--prescribed by phone.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, it was desperation," his sister says. "You want to believe
something is out there that might be that magic thing that will save
you."</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly and his family became convinced his illness was somehow
connected to missions in which he dropped bombs on chemical plants and
munitions depots in Iraq, then flew back through toxic plumes rising from
the targets.</TE>
<TE>   They also note that he became sick at the Texas air base after he
jogged through a cloud of the pesticide malathion, used to control
mosquitoes. Could that exposure, years later, have triggered the disease?</TE>
<TE>   Dr. John Feussner, the VA's chief research officer, says while some
chemicals and pesticides are associated with nerve damage, so far there
isn't much evidence they can cause ALS.</TE>
<TE>   But he didn't rule out anything. "Exposure to chemicals is a fair
question and we should try to answer that," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The government's study that found higher ALS rates for Gulf War vets
doesn't say how they got the disease.</TE>
<TE>   But Dr. Robert Haley, who has studied sick Gulf veterans for eight
years, including many ALS cases, says several studies already have linked
pesticides or farming to the disease. The importance of the Texas
exposure, he says, is unclear--it could be a "red herring or . . . an
inciting event."</TE>
<TE>   Haley also points out that during the Gulf War, the military protected
troops from insect-borne diseases by "spraying copious amounts of
pesticides. . . . It was widely believed they were safe."</TE>
<TE>   As Michael Donnelly's cane gave way to a wheelchair, he and his family
pressed on.</TE>
<TE>   It was strange at first, taking on the military.</TE>
<TE>   As a young man, Tom Donnelly flew the Marine Corps flag beside the
Stars and Stripes. His four children greeted him nightly by lining up on
the steps, Von Trapp family style, and singing the Marine hymn.</TE>
<TE>   Even Michael, who rose to major in the Air Force, was hesitant. "I
was," he says, "a reluctant warrior."</TE>
<TE>   But they joined forces.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Rae, became the medical researcher, phoning doctors and
foundations. His father and his sister, Denise, became the agitators.
They made hundreds of calls and wrote hundreds of letters until powerful
people in the VA and the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill knew their names.</TE>
<TE>   They also tracked down other ALS Gulf veterans and designed a medical
questionnaire for them.</TE>
<TE>   Once all three even picketed a speech by retired Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf, the Desert Storm commander--much to Michael Donnelly's
chagrin.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Donnelly, his blue uniform bedecked with ribbons, testified
on Capitol Hill, claiming the military was trying to cover up and
trivialize Gulf War illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember," he said, his words already slurred as his throat muscles
were wasting away, "I am not the enemy."</TE>
<TE>   It pained him to be there.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael was always the good guy," says his wife, Susan. "He would go
out of his way to make people comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Donnelly, with his sister's help, published his story. H.
Ross Perot, who has bankrolled research on Gulf War illness, helped get
them on Larry King's show.</TE>
<TE>   "I had this illusion that writing this book would be saving his life
somehow," Denise says. "We really felt rushed. I thought, maybe if we can
just get the word out, somebody would read it and know what to do and the
government would find a way to fund the research and find a cure."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, there was nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Well, not exactly nothing.</TE>
<TE>   That fall, at a Gulf War conference, Denise recalls a Pentagon
official knelt, looked into Michael's eyes and said, "I'm going to do
everything I can to help you."</TE>
<TE>   By then, Donnelly had a voice synthesizer. He typed a message,
repeated by a mechanical voice: "Save my ass. Don't kiss it."</TE>
<TE>   Science was stacked against Michael Donnelly.</TE>
<TE>   Three government studies in the 1990s had not found any link between
Gulf veterans and neurological illnesses. But his family refused to go
away.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't help but be impressed with their passion," says
Feussner, the VA researcher. "They were desperately trying to find a
treatment for their son and they simply wanted to know as best as they
could whether there was an association or not."</TE>
<TE>   After meeting the Donnellys and veterans groups, Feussner asked for a
review of earlier data. It found that ALS victims were younger than
expected.</TE>
<TE>   A new, exhaustive study was ordered and preliminary results announced
in December 2001 found ALS was nearly twice as common for Gulf veterans
as a group, compared with members of the military not deployed in that
region. The rate was 2.7 times higher for those who had been in the Air
Force.</TE>
<TE>   Since the disease is rare, the numbers are tiny: 40 among 700,000
people in the Gulf, compared with 67 in the non-deployed group of 1.8
million.</TE>
<TE>   Feussner calls the rate "statistically significant" but acknowledges
there was a sense of urgency in connecting the disease to the war,
because it paved the way for benefits.</TE>
<TE>   He says VA Secretary Anthony J. Principi didn't want to wait up to a
year for the study to appear in a scientific journal, knowing the disease
already had killed half the ALS-stricken vets.</TE>
<TE>   The VA decision provides disability and survivor benefits to ALS
veterans and their families.</TE>
<TE>   Money was never the issue for Donnelly. Because he became ill while on
active duty, he received disability benefits.</TE>
<TE>   But Joshua Calderon, a 44-year-old former Army medic in the Gulf, was
retired when diagnosed with ALS in 1997. He says he was denied benefits
three times.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt abandoned . . . like I was fighting the same war at home," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   He credits Donnelly for the benefits he'll receive. "If it wasn't for
him," he says, "this would have taken a lot longer."</TE>
<TE>   The family's role also was recognized when the VA announced the
change: That day, Principi phoned Donnelly's father.</TE>
<TE>   And Pat Eddington, author of a book on Gulf War illnesses, says the
campaign by the Donnellys made a huge difference. "It was just raw,
relentless, determination to get an entire agency . . . to change its
position," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly says he feels vindicated not just for himself, but for
others. He says nine of his 40 squadron members are ill or have sick
family members.</TE>
<TE>   The ALS study continues, but Feussner says it will be hard to
establish a cause because there are so few cases and not much information
about exposure.</TE>
<TE>   Feussner also notes that just because a study says something doesn't
make it so. It's important, he says, to have your work replicated by
other scientists.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that would give it more credibility," he says.
"But that will take years."</TE>
<TE>   A battle has been won, but for Donnelly, life doesn't change.</TE>
<TE>   Being tethered to machines, knowing ALS is a death sentence--those
pressures remain.</TE>
<TE>   "In the war, it was only a short time under fire," he says. "This is
full time."</TE>
<TE>   But he is thrilled by the VA's decision. He and his family hope it
will be a step toward a cure.</TE>
<TE>   "This confers dignity on him," says Denise Donnelly. "It's his
legacy."</TE>
<TE>   In his den one winter afternoon, talk turned to the air attacks on
terrorist camps in Afghanistan. Would Donnelly like to be in the cockpit,
his hand on the controls, high in the skies on the front lines again?</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, he spells: "In a New--"</TE>
<TE>   Tom Donnelly anticipates what's next, and bursts out: "In a New York
minute!"</TE>
<TE>   The father barks a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   His son's face lights up.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Donnelly can still command a room.</TE>

<HD>Skating Decision Reversed</HD>
<DH>Medals: Canadian figure skaters David Pelletier and Jamie Sale will
get the gold after all. Russian rivals get to keep theirs too.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>The Canadian skaters whose loss to a Russian duo set off the
biggest judging scandal in Winter Olympics history got their gold medal
after all Friday, and the judge at the center of the furor was suspended.</LD>
<LD>   The extraordinary deal awarding Canadians David Pelletier and Jamie
Sale the gold capped a furious weeklong debate that had engulfed the
Olympics and prompted the sort of complaints about judging that used to
be heard during the Cold War.</LD>
<LD>   "We're happy that justice was done," Pelletier said.</LD>
<TE>   Under the agreement, Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze
get to keep their gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   The International Skating Union, figure skating's governing body,
indefinitely suspended Marie-Reine Le Gougne, the French judge who said
she was pressured by her own federation to give the Russian duo the gold
in Monday's pairs skating event.</TE>
<TE>   "She acted in a way that was not adequate to guarantee both pairs
equal condition. We have declared misconduct," ISU president Ottavio
Cinquanta said.</TE>
<TE>   The French judge has signed a statement about how she reached her
vote, Cinquanta said. There was no evidence of Russian involvement, he
added. He refused to give further details about why she voted for the
Russians.</TE>
<TE>   The head of the French Olympic team again denied that his federation
pressured Le Gougne, who is prohibited by ISU rules from discussing her
vote publicly.</TE>
<TE>   "I completely deny the scandalous allegations," Didier Gailhaguet said
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta said he hoped to formally present Sale and Pelletier with
the gold Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "We do hope we can get the bronze, too, so we can get the entire
collection," Pelletier joked.</TE>
<TE>   When the decision was announced, a cheer went up at the Canadian
Olympic Lodge in Salt Lake City, and fans gathered to sing the national
anthem. "Welcome to Canada and welcome to our gold!" volunteer Tom McAfee
yelled to visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Sale expressed relief but said the investigation must continue. "For
the future of our sport, this has to be fixed. The truth still has to
come out," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said she felt cheated when she and Pelletier had to settle for the
silver.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what every Olympian dreams of, and that's all I've dreamed of
my whole life," she said. "I visualized being in the middle and hearing
my anthem. I was prepared for it, emotionally and physically. You bet I
was cheated out of that big time."</TE>
<TE>   Said Pelletier: "It doesn't take away anything from Elena and Anton.
This was not something against them. It was something against the
system."</TE>
<TE>   The head of the Russian Figure Skating Federation criticized the move.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an unprecedented decision that turned out to be a result of
pressure by the North American press, and turned out in favor of the
fanatically loyal" fans, Valentin Piseyev told Russia's NTV television.</TE>
<TE>   "You have seen how the public reacts to even the tiniest mistakes of
our athletes, and how they absolutely don't notice when the Canadians
fall or when the Americans fall."</TE>
<TE>   Sikharulidze also reacted bitterly to the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "The media is making us like bad guys. We are not bad guys. We never
talked to judges. I don't have enough money to buy nine judges," he said.
"They ask people in Canada who won, but if they ask in Moscow, I will
give you 2 million people who say the Russians."</TE>
<TE>   He said he fears how the public will react when both couples appear in
the traditional exhibition that concludes Olympic skating.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea what it will be like, if they throw eggs and tomatoes
on us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, President Bush said, "I do think it's the right thing
to award two gold medals for the skaters, the Canadian skaters."</TE>
<TE>   The Canadians, meanwhile, were "heartened and encouraged" that the
investigation is not over, said Marilyn Chidlow, president of Skate
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy renewed complaints over the inherent subjectivity of
judging in figure skating and brought to mind the Cold War era, when many
competitors suspected that medals were sometimes awarded on the basis of
politics.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy began when Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze won a 5-4
decision over the Canadians, surprising many observers. Sale and
Pelletier had skated flawlessly, while the Russians made a technical
error.</TE>
<TE>   After days of recriminations, the International Olympic Committee's
executive board Friday morning voted 7-1, with one abstention, to accept
the solution recommended by the skating union.</TE>
<TE>   "We took a position that is one of justice and fairness for the
athletes," IOC president Jacques Rogge said.</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta acknowledged "public opinion helped a great deal" in
influencing the ISU's action. "That's a good thing," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Russian member Vitaly Smirnov abstained from the vote, while He
Zhenliang of China voted against the recommendation, according to an
Olympic source who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC decision was not unprecedented. In 1993 the committee awarded
a second gold medal in synchronized swimming from the Barcelona Games to
Canada's Sylvie Frechette. The IOC decided that a Brazilian judge who had
mistyped a score into her computer should have been allowed to fix her
error.</TE>
<TE>   In the Salt Lake City dispute, the ISU had planned to review the
scoring at a meeting this week, but the deal allowed the matter to be
settled in the swift manner the IOC had urged.</TE>
