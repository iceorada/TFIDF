<HD>'Skins' plumbs despair at a historic reservation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Writer Sherman Alexie and director Chris Eyre joined forces in 1998
to make the bittersweet comedy "Smoke Signals," a groundbreaking work
in Native American filmmaking.</LD>
<LD>   Alexie's bravura yet intimate "The Business of Fancydancing," his
venturesome directorial debut, was released earlier this year, and
now Eyre's impressive second feature, "Skins," has arrived.</LD>
<LD>   The two new films could scarcely be more different in style and
temperament, yet they complement each other perfectly. Both Alexie
and Eyre are passionate about bringing authentic Native American
experience to the screen, and both deplore the dismal, destructive
conditions of reservation life. But "Fancydancing" is boldly stylish,
and "Skins, which Jennifer D. Lyne adapted from the Adrian C. Louis
novel, is raw and gritty. Alexie's hero has left the reservation to
assert his identity as a gay man and to speak out as a Native
American poet of protest. Eyre's hero has stayed put, attempting to
make a difference as a reservation cop.</LD>
<TE>   Eric Schweig's Rudy Yellow Lodge is beginning to give in to
despair in a never-ending battle against crime that grows out of
widespread alcoholism. Rudy's reservation is Pine Ridge, site of the
Wounded Knee Massacre, where Oglala Sioux live in a dreary rural slum
with an ironic backdrop in the grandeur of Mt. Rushmore, with its
famous presidential sculptures a desecration of a mountain range
sacred to Native Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The bitter legacy of Wounded Knee lingers at ostensibly dry Pine
Ridge, where unemployment runs high and alcoholism is epidemic,
fueled by the four liquor stores of nearby Whiteclay, Neb.
(population 22), from which Native Americans are said to purchase
about 4 million cans of beer a year.</TE>
<TE>   Rudy's escalating sense of hopelessness is exacerbated by the
chronic drunkenness of his combative older brother Mogie (Graham
Greene), who remains traumatized by his brutal tour of duty in
Vietnam, where he earned three Purple Hearts.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers once were close and Rudy and Mogie were star football
players. But Rudy long ago lost respect for the older brother he once
idolized, and Mogie regards Rudy with cynical contempt as a
goody-two-shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Rudy has started taking the law into his own hands, however, and
his vigilantism will have profound and unexpected consequences for
both.</TE>
<TE>   In his two stars, Eyre has two of the foremost Native American
actors. Both Schweig and Greene are actors of strong physical
presence. Each has emotional range and intensity that demolish movie
stereotypes of Indians as stoics.</TE>
<TE>   "Skins" is a wrenching, uncompromisingly bleak film, but its
stars, who include talented newcomer Noah Watts as Mogie's son and
Lois Red Elk as the brothers' staunch aunt, fill the screen with
warmth, humor and spiritual yearning in the face of hardship and
tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   First together and now individually, Alexie and Eyre show great
promise of an authentic Native American cinema.</TE>

<DH>Trivial Pursuit catches up on 20 years of curiosities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mimi Avins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the annals of social interaction, Trivial Pursuit is a very big
deal. Word and board games had existed before 1982, when the brain
tickler in a box became widely available, and of course people had
gathered together for an evening of conversation before then. But no
board game created for adults had ever become such a phenomenal
success, even among those who didn't play cards or chess and who
thought children's games like Monopoly were insomnia cures.</LD>
<LD>   Although its impact on social life at the end of the 20th century
was not as profound as that of the AIDS virus or the invention of
e-mail, Trivial Pursuit did start its own little revolution, fought
by a gregarious army of competitors willing to take off their Walkman
earphones, turn off their computers and leave the cathode ray glow of
their TV sets to play games designed for groups of grown-ups. And now
there's a 20th anniversary edition of the game that could lure a new
generation away from their Palm Pilots, iPods and personal DVD
players with questions about Nikes known by name, deposed communist
leaders and Max Headroom.</LD>
<TE>   Trivial Pursuit is fast, irreverent, simultaneously smart and
silly. Two to six players move around a wheel by answering questions
in six categories. Whoever's seemingly normal mind is actually
crammed with minutiae about sports, history, geography, science,
literature, and arts and entertainment wins. Each version of the game
contains about 4,000 questions on cards that are rotated in play, so
enthusiasts can spend a lot of time huddling around a Trivial Pursuit
board before hearing a question twice.</TE>
<TE>   The mechanics of the game don't begin to convey its charm. Who
cares whether you know what bodily function can reach the breakneck
speed of 100 miles an hour? Considering the possibilities is
hilarious. And if you guess that a sneeze has extraordinary velocity
and therefore move on to the next category, so much the better.</TE>
<TE>   Trivial Pursuit mania peaked in 1984, when more than 20 million
games were purchased in North America. What was its unprecedented
sales record? It grossed $1.4 million on 40 million units in 36
months. Until then, any game that sold 1 million a year was
considered a hit. Today, Trivial Pursuit is played in 26 countries
and 17 languages, and nearly 80 million games have been sold
throughout the world. More than a dozen editions have been issued,
including special ones with questions devoted to movies, sports or
topics dear to the hearts of a particular constituency, such as "Star
Wars" fanatics or baby boomers. The 20th anniversary edition features
questions that will remind those old enough to remember the '80s and
'90s what a long, strange trip it's been.</TE>
<TE>   Remember Joey Buttafuoco? "Fantasy Island"? Smurfs and PacMan? You
had to be there, and if you were, you just might know "What 'Party of
Five' star prompted Mademoiselle reporter Suzan Colon to gush: 'She
let me feel them, they're real, end of discussion' ?" "Party of Five"
is dead, as is Mademoiselle magazine. But they linger at the trivia
party, where the ghosts of history and pop culture enjoy one last
dance under the disco ball.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Journalists' brainchild</TE>
<TE>   Scott Abbott, sports editor of the Canadian Press in Montreal, and
Chris Haney, photo editor of the Montreal Gazette, were housemates in
1979, when they decided to invent a game. "The fact that we were
journalists was key," Abbott says. "We were used to facts and
information. We had spent a lot of time sitting in taverns or
newsrooms ruminating about weird facts or asking each other
questions. A command of trivia is a way for true sports fans to prove
they have a depth of knowledge about sports."</TE>
<TE>   Once they'd created a prototype, they recruited two friends to
help them raise capital and market their invention. In three years
they went through $100,000, self-publishing and selling games in
Canada before finding a big American company that believed in Trivial
Pursuit. "The name was really important to the game's success,"
Abbott says. "If it had been called Quiz 4000, it wouldn't have been
as good."</TE>
<TE>   How to play can be explained in less time than it takes to
decimate a platter of hors d'oeuvres. Pursuit of victory may be
trivial, but it's also curiously addictive. The very nature of trivia
is that it usually isn't studied, rather absorbed by a kind of
osmosis. The person who knows the answer to "How many plays did
Shakespeare write?" is probably as surprised as anyone that 37 popped
into mind, and longs to repeat that heady experience. As obscure as
many of the questions appear to be, their scope is so broad that
everyone knows or can guess some answers.</TE>
<TE>   "People often have different strengths as players," says John
Chandler, senior vice president of marketing for Hasbro Games. "You
could find yourself playing with people who are very worldly and
learned, but they don't know the first thing about 'Seinfeld.' And a
person could not know much about science or literature, but if they
come up with the necessary sports fact to answer the final question,
they're the hero of their team."</TE>
<TE>   Many games expose sore losers and bullies, and Trivial Pursuit has
been known to reveal its share of character traits. While shopping
for a distributor for their brainchild, Abbott and Haney were
rejected by a number of companies that said the game would make
people feel stupid. Turning down Trivial Pursuit is an executive
decision on a par with not backing EBay, but such reasoning wasn't
entirely off the mark. The game didn't sell well in Japan, some
think, because the Japanese consider it bad manners to go to
someone's house and beat them at something, especially brainpower.</TE>
<TE>   Friendships have been forged and lost over Trivial Pursuit.
Easygoing folks just play for fun. The intellectually vain refuse to
participate, not wanting gaps in their knowledge made public.
Know-it-alls who really do can find their popularity suffers.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Johnson, now senior producer and head writer of "Jeopardy!,"
enjoyed playing at family gatherings when he was a writer for the
original "Hollywood Squares." "I'm pretty hard to beat, and a lot of
times people didn't want to play with me," he says. "There would be
teams of two or three set up, and they'd make me play alone."</TE>
<TE>   Trivial Pursuit rode into the Information Age on a gust of
galloping media penetration and celebrity journalism. "The fact that
we live in a time when celebrities are exposed, dissected, celebrated
and castigated on a daily basis is helpful to this kind of game,"
Abbott says. "It wouldn't have worked in the Middle Ages, when the
locals never got more than a few miles from home and didn't have TV."</TE>
<TE>   It was the right amusement for a time when information wasn't just
power, it was fun. "Late Show With David Letterman" also debuted in
1982, with a sense of humor similar to the one that made the game's
questions such knee slappers. A taste for absurdity, as well as an
ear for double entendres, is needed to write questions like "What
Pennsylvania institution changed its name to Arcadia University in
2001, after Web filters began blocking its old moniker?" (Once you
hear that "Beaver College" is the answer, will you ever forget?)</TE>
<TE>   Spy Magazine, another cultural phenomenon cherished by those with
an appreciation of the arcane, came out in 1986. "The access to
information about everything and everybody, access to gushes of data,
has increased since the Web has become part of our lives," says Kurt
Andersen, one of the founders of Spy. "The sensibility of the
magazine, its obsessiveness, all these connections that we made and
the density of information in it was a Web thing before there was a
Web."</TE>
<TE>   It isn't a Trivial Pursuit question: Which came first, the
quickening pace of technological and cultural change or the taste for
entertainment infused with a passion for data? Yet it all happened in
the '80s, and it continues. A full-time staff of five
writer-researchers works at Hasbro Games' headquarters in
Massachusetts, keeping a bank of questions filled, ready for the next
edition.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to their diligence, a sports nut or a Cal Ripken Jr. fan
can become trivia king for a night when asked: "What infielder was
named MVP of baseball's All Star Game during both Bush presidencies?"</TE>

<LD>'Spy'</LD>
<LD>   'The Inside Story of How the FBI's Robert Hanssen Betrayed
America'</LD>
<LD>   David Wise</LD>
<TE>   Random House; 310 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Wise's "Spy" presents two conundrums: Why did Robert
Hanssen, who long sat at or near the center of the FBI's
counterintelligence operations, betray everything he knew -- about
6,000 pages of top-secret U.S. material -- to the Russians for 22
years? And why did the FBI and the rest of the U.S. intelligence
apparatus fail to catch him for so long?</TE>
<TE>   Wise, who has expertly studied and written about spies for a
lifetime, attacks the first question diligently, yet in the end
leaves it at least partially unanswered. Hanssen fits, Wise writes,
"into no known previous category of spies." He made some money, but
he was not entirely motivated by it, and he certainly did not spy for
ideological reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Hanssen was, Wise says, "a walking paradox." The FBI put him in
charge of a hunt for a "mole," while he was the mole himself. He was
a zealous anti-Communist. The father of six children, he was a pious
Catholic who went to Mass every day. He was an ardent member of the
secretive, disciplined Catholic organization Opus Dei.</TE>
<TE>   Hanssen got his longtime best friend to watch him and his wife
having sex, then, to make it easier for the friend, he filmed and
broadcast the scenes on in-house television. Hanssen imagined
drugging his wife and having his friend get her pregnant. He and this
friend shared pornography for years. Hanssen gave expensive gifts --
a diamond and sapphire necklace, a used Mercedes-Benz -- to a
stripper and even took her to Hong Kong with him on an official FBI
trip (at his expense), but he rebuffed her when she came on to him.</TE>
<TE>   With permission all around, Wise talked at length with the
psychiatrist who examined Hanssen in prison. The psychiatrist, David
Charney, concluded that essentially, in betraying the FBI, Hanssen
was getting back at his cold and abusive father (a Chicago cop).</TE>
<TE>   Charney thought Hanssen was also using the money to meet the
(unexpressed) expectations of his wife; for instance, they sent their
children to private Opus Dei schools. Charney concluded that
Hanssen's sexual activities were not a major part of his betrayal,
even though another psychiatrist thought that they were. In any case,
"he was a traitor and a pervert," his wife cried when the FBI told
her the whole story.</TE>
<TE>   The answer to the second question, why Hanssen was not caught
sooner, comes through clearly enough in "Spy." In short, the FBI and
the rest of the intelligence bureaucracy were hidebound,
self-protective and not very smart.</TE>
<TE>   A decade before he was caught, the FBI was told he had a lot of
unexplained cash. In 1991 there was the Hong Kong stripper trip; in
1993 he broke into a colleague's computer. He declined to take a
lie-detector test for a better job; in 1997 FBI technicians found he
had a "password breaker" on his computer. No one put these clues
together. Wise concludes that the reason was that FBI agents were
thought to be incapable of such disloyal acts as Hanssen's.</TE>
<TE>   True, the FBI finally got its man. Through the CIA, the FBI paid
$7 million to a Russian for the KGB file that led to Hanssen (and, in
February 2001, to his arrest as he left documents for the Russians in
a northern Virginia park).</TE>
<TE>   At the request of the intelligence agencies, who wanted to get
from him all he knew, the government did not ask for the death
penalty at his trial. He is spending his life in prison. But along
the way, the FBI had pursued another man as the suspected mole, who
was suspended from his CIA job for two years. Even as the new
Kissinger Commission investigates the activities of U.S. intelligence
before Sept. 11, "Spy" provides substantial evidence of a troubled
intelligence community.</TE>

<HD>Clear Channel cancels Guns N' Roses tour</HD>
<DH>Promoter gives no reasons, but the band, and sometimes the
fans, didn't always show up for performances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoff Boucher</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first Guns N' Roses tour in nine years is over after just a month
and will be remembered as a road run that began and ended with booing
fans and an empty stage.</LD>
<LD>   The "Chinese Democracy" tour has been called off by Clear Channel
Entertainment, the promoter that did not cite a reason for the
surrender in its terse news release. The reasons were evident in the
arenas, however, where on too many nights, either the fans or the
band didn't show up as expected.</LD>
<LD>   Ticket-holders have been told to get refunds at the point of
purchase. The canceled shows include a Jan. 3 date at the Forum and
Dec. 27 at the San Diego Sports Arena.</LD>
<TE>   On Nov. 7, the kickoff show in Vancouver was canceled at the last
minute, sparking a fan melee that led to injuries and arrests.
Twenty-nine days later, another no-show by the band, in Philadelphia,
led to more rowdiness and set in motion the backstage talks that
closed the curtain on Axl Rose and company.</TE>
<TE>   The tour, more than a year and a half in the planning, was hobbled
before it started by the failure of band leader Rose to deliver
"Chinese Democracy," the tie-in album that has been promised for
years. A spokeswoman for Interscope Records said Thursday the label
would have no comment and that no release date has been set for the
album.</TE>
<TE>   Even without the marketing value of new music in stores and on
radio, Clear Channel pushed hard to make the show a hot ticket: When
tickets went on sale for the first set of shows, there was robust
response in such markets as Boston, Philadelphia and New York. In the
latter, tickets for the Madison Square Garden show sold out in
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Vancouver fiasco reminded fans of Rose's consistent
inconsistency as a performer and instantly sapped any tour momentum.
The Forum show was put on sale within days and was greeted by frosty
fan interest. Only half of the tickets for the hometown venue had
been sold.</TE>
<TE>   Fan safety and mounting financial risk haunted the tour's key
players, as did the erratic ways of Rose, who would pop in a
different city than scheduled in the hours before some shows. "It was
getting ridiculous," one official with the tour said. No one at Clear
Channel or at Sanctuary, the band's management company, would comment
publicly Thursday. In recent days, all involved have huddled to
broker the messy cancellation. Among the issues: The $1-million
advance given to Rose last year to secure the tour.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Hewitt, a Los Angeles promoter who partnered on an Idaho date
for the Guns N' Roses tour, said Thursday that timing and temperament
again undermined Rose, whose mercurial ways are legendary.</TE>
<TE>   "He managed to cancel the dates that were doing well [at the box
office], and when they didn't, he showed up," Hewitt said. "We did a
show in Boise that did horrible business, and he showed. I wished he
didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Wood, an executive vice president at Ticketmaster, wondered if
Rose would get another chance.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of people were excited about this one, and it's a
shame Axl can't get this thing together," Wood said. "I would think
now that any promoter would really think twice before trying this
again. These tours are expensive."</TE>

<HD>Tennessee Williams' eloquence flows in a convincing solo
show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Philip Brandes</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"If the writing is honest, it cannot be separated from the one who
writes it," Tennessee Williams once observed. It's a mandate that
actor Jeremy Lawrence has taken very much to heart in creating his
one-man portrait of the playwright, "Talking Tennessee."</LD>
<LD>   Joining "Tennessee in the Summer" and "Lament of the Moths" in a
Williams-themed trilogy at Studio City's Laurelgrove Theatre,
Lawrence's meticulously crafted presentation is a deceptively breezy,
in-character series of personal anecdotes and career reminiscences
addressed directly to his audience -- a format ideally suited to the
master of the memory play.</LD>
<LD>   Without resorting to imaginary situations or putting words in his
subject's mouth, Lawrence culled the entire text from Williams'
"occasional" writings -- essays (the collection published as "Where I
Live" was a primary source), newspaper articles and interviews, poems
and even record album jackets. That the resulting piece comes across
as a seamless and believably intimate conversation with Williams is a
great credit to Lawrence's editorial skills in weaving together his
diverse sources, as well as to his presence and delivery.</LD>
<TE>   Only a few curious lighting changes and an unnecessary
intermission distract from an utterly convincing incarnation. Through
precise accent, inflections and cadences, Lawrence uncannily evokes
the Williams preserved in audio recordings, punctuated with knowing
smiles and rolling eyes at the human frailty he recounts -- including
his own. From throwaway descriptions (being surrounded at a table of
"Mac trucks disguised as women") to poignant self-revelations
(getting an unnecessary eye operation to "retreat behind a gauze
mask" from his own success), Lawrence radiates the sly, effete
delicacy and gentility that never deterred Williams from confronting
and embracing the most wrenching human tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Like so many of his characters, Williams was "an exile from the
time and place of his own fulfillment." In the elegantly languid
sentences that wind gently around the bends of psychological defenses
to coax forth uncomfortable truths, Lawrence finds the essential
paradox of romanticism and steely, unflinching realism that so
baffled Williams' contemporary critics.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most important, rather than rehashing the lurid fodder of
Williams' late-career spiral into dissolution and squalor so
abundantly dramatized elsewhere, "Talking Tennessee" presents the
author at the height of his eloquence and creative powers. By
focusing on the relationship between Williams and his art, Lawrence
leaves us with a deeper appreciation for both.</TE>

<HD>Brosnan fights for his kids in 'Evelyn'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Evelyn" is awash in sentimentality and doesn't care who knows it.
Despite a story predictable enough to make "The Sound of Music" play
like a nail-biting thriller, its heart is so much in the right place
it is difficult to get really peeved at it.</LD>
<LD>   Based on a true story but best described, in screenwriter Paul
Pender's words, as "a fable inspired by true events," "Evelyn" is a
product of star Pierce Brosnan's production company, and it is not
difficult to see what caught the actor's eye.</LD>
<LD>   Now an international star as a result of a quartet of suave James
Bond films, Brosnan clearly relished the opportunity to play a salt
of the earth individual (albeit one with a twinkle in his eye) named
Desmond Doyle, an unemployed painter and decorator in 1950s Dublin
with no money, no job, but three kids (the eldest is named Evelyn) he
loves even more than the drink.</LD>
<TE>   Brosnan loved the part so much he involved director Bruce
Beresford (they'd worked together on "Mr. Johnson"), and no doubt had
a hand in rounding up a high-profile group of co-stars that includes
Aidan Quinn, Julianna Margulies, Stephen Rea and Alan Bates.</TE>
<TE>   "Evelyn's" story was likely a draw as well. Although a single
parent by necessity, his wife having deserted him, Doyle is forced by
rigid laws and an unfeeling state to place his children in church-run
orphanages.</TE>
<TE>   Vowing "there's no bloody laws in this country going to keep me
from my daughter" (yes, he really says that), Doyle uses the moral
support of barmaid Margulies and the legal assistance of lawyers
Quinn, Rea and Bates to take his battle to the highest courts in the
land. It's hard not to root for him, but it's also hard not to wish
that "Evelyn" didn't resort to treacly plot devices like having rays
of sun serve as guardian angels. Doyle's story likely doesn't need
the special pleading the film gives it, but there it is.</TE>
<TE>   --Kenneth Turan</TE>
<TE>   "Evelyn." Rated PG, for thematic material and language. Running
time: 1 hour, 30 minutes. In selected theaters.</TE>

<HD>'Revolution #9' is tough tale of schizophrenia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tim McCann's "Revolution #9" is a taut, intelligent psychological
drama that effectively plays one nightmare against the other: the
first being a Manhattan freelance writer's (Michael Risley) descent
into schizophrenia and the other being the ordeal his fiancee
(Adrienne Shelly) plunges into when she tackles the woefully
inadequate mental health bureaucracy in her desperate attempt to get
him some help. In regard to the second element, McCann exposes rather
than preaches, and his film is the very model of the forceful,
no-frills low-budget New York independent production.</LD>
<LD>   James Jackson (Risley) is an articulate writer for an online arts
magazine who has been dating Kim Kelly (Shelly), a restaurant
bartender, for a year and a half when he announces their engagement
to her relatives. It is at just this point, however, that Jackson has
commenced experiencing paranoid delusions. He's convinced that a
co-worker is messing with stuff on his desk and then accuses Kim's
11-year-old computer whiz nephew (Jase Blankfort) of sending him
subliminal computer messages via a commercial for Revolution #9
perfume as part of a vast conspiracy to control his mind and those of
everyone else. Jackson's disintegration escalates as Kelly's attempt
to deal with it bogs down at every turn.</LD>
<TE>   Risley is suitably harrowing, but the film's linchpin is Shelley.
Since her emergence in Hal Hartley's 1990 "The Unbelievable Truth,"
Shelly has been a beguiling presence in the East Coast independent
scene but can sometimes come off as an irritatingly mannered pixie.
Here she has one of her strongest roles: a caring and determined but
otherwise ordinary woman put to the severest of tests, and confronted
by a lack of support from her family and the initially hesitant
involvement of her acerbic best friend (Callie Thorne).</TE>
<TE>   "Revolution #9," which is absorbing and terse, has some subtle,
welcome comic relief from Spalding Gray as the director of the film's
title commercial, a man whose ego is flattered by Jackson, posing as
an admiring journalist.</TE>
<TE>   -- Kevin Thomas</TE>
<TE>   "Revolution # 9." Unrated. Adult themes, too intense for children.
Running time: 1 hour, 31 minutes. Exclusively at the Sunset 5, 8000
Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, (323) 848-3500.</TE>

<HD>S. Korean director impresses with debut</HD>
<DH>Jae-eun Jeong shows a gift for storytelling with the
coming-of-age film 'Take Care of My Cat.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jae-eun Jeong's "Take Care of My Cat" brings a beguiling freshness to
a coming-of-age story with such a buoyant, expressive flow of images
that it emerges as another key contribution to the flowering of the
South Korean cinema. Jeong's feature debut has been shown at major
film festivals the world over, collecting a number of awards along
the way as one of the most accomplished foreign films of the year.</LD>
<LD>   The key setting is Inchon, site of a U.N. forces landing that
turned the tide of the Korean War and today a heavily industrialized
port city. Significantly, the film's first shot is of a young woman,
Tae-hee, boarding a commuter train for Seoul, 25 miles away. A recent
high school graduate, Tae-hee (Doo-na Bae) has landed a junior
position in a brokerage firm and has quickly become caught up in what
represents for her an exciting new world full of possibilities.</LD>
<TE>   She has left behind in Inchon four classmates with whom she means
to stay in close touch. The independent-thinking Hae-joo (Yo-won Lee)
lives at home and is expected to work without pay in the family
heating business; she also takes dictation from a gifted poet
afflicted by cerebral palsy. Ji-young (Ji-young Ok), taller and
deeper-voiced than her friends, struggles to find a job while staying
on with her hard-working grandparents, who live and work in a tiny
shantytown hovel. Rounding out the group are cheerful twin sisters
(Eun-shil and Eun-joo Lee), who sell jewelry on the streets of the
city's Chinatown.</TE>
<TE>   A less imaginative director would make Tae-hee and her adventures
in the big city the film's focal point, but Jeong gradually moves
Hae-joo, by far the most alert and reflective member of the group, to
the fore as she feels increasingly oppressed by her overbearing,
patriarchal father. In her unhappiness with her lot in life she
cannot help but embark upon a journey of self-discovery that will
have substantial effect upon others as well as herself.
Interestingly, while all these women certainly are interested in men,
they are so caught up in the challenge of life that they have no time
to pursue romance.</TE>
<TE>   Bae took three best actress awards, at two Korean festivals and in
the Korean film critics annual prizes, for her incisive portrayal of
Tae-hee.</TE>
<TE>   There is a wonderful natural quality to Jeong's storytelling that
is enhanced by cinematographer Young-hwan Choi's graceful camerawork
and by a dynamic, contemporary score from M&amp;F.</TE>
<TE>   As a feminist filmmaker, Jeong has already mastered the knack of
depicting women's concerns without being the least bit preachy.</TE>

<HD>New competition for an old format</HD>
<DH>KLAC's switch from talk back to pop standards angers a
station with a similar playlist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Carney</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new approach to adult standards that KLAC-AM (570) took to the
airwaves Thursday may be fun and hip, but it's not cool, according to
a cross-town competitor.</LD>
<LD>   KLAC flipped from all-talk to what management is calling a
"martini format," a recipe that mixes the likes of Tony Bennett and
Ella Fitzgerald with newer artists such as Norah Jones and Harry
Connick Jr., performing their own songs as well as classics by Cole
Porter and the Gershwins.</LD>
<LD>   KLAC's new incarnation, "the Fabulous 570," launched at noon
Thursday with Rod Stewart performing live at the Museum of Television
&amp; Radio in Beverly Hills. The success of Stewart's
multimillion-selling new album, "It Had to Be You ... The Great
American Songbook," convinced executives at parent company Clear
Channel Communications that the Southland was ripe for an updated
standards format.</LD>
<TE>   "My God, the music on a station like this speaks for itself. It's
great music," said Roy Laughlin, vice president of Clear Channel-Los
Angeles. "We don't see ourselves as an oldies station, or a standards
station, or a nostalgia station. We see ourselves as a completely new
mix of music."</TE>
<TE>   But the mix is anything but new, nor the invention of Clear
Channel, contends Saul Levine, who says it's the same format he's
been broadcasting since March from "The Surf," at KSUR-AM (1260) and
XSURF (540).</TE>
<TE>   KLAC had been airing standards until switching to talk last year,
but had taken the more traditional approach to those songs -- with a
"music of your life" format, for listeners closer to the end of
theirs than young hipsters.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a substantial audience of people 50-plus who wanted to
hear this and they dumped them. They decided to heck with it. There
wasn't enough money in it," Levine said of KLAC's decision to drop
that format last year. Their backpedaling angers him.</TE>
<TE>   "These people over there at Clear Channel, who are really beyond
words, saw the possibility of the format and decided to come in and
take it away from us," he said, calling the situation a case of an
"800-pound gorilla attacking L.A.'s last mom-and-pop radio station. I
don't like being threatened. I'm taking this personally. We're going
to let the people decide."</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to do whatever it takes to let justice be done,"
Levine said, including making his station commercial-free for at
least the next three months. "It isn't a matter of money for me. It's
a matter of principle."</TE>
<TE>   Levine added that his independence and his corresponding freedom
to make such moves give him an advantage over a corporate behemoth
such as Clear Channel, which owns more than 1,200 stations nationwide
and the FCC maximum of eight in Los Angeles, including KBIG-FM
(104.3), KHHT-FM (92.3), KIIS-FM (102.7), KOST-FM (103.5), KYSR-FM
(98.7), KFI-AM (640) and KXTA-AM (1150).</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel has to make money and show a profit for
stockholders, Levine said. "So they've got to run every last
[commercial] spot that they can."</TE>
<TE>   But what Levine criticizes as size and muscle, Laughlin cites as
an economy of scale that will help KLAC succeed. "We don't have to
make the station survive exclusively on its own," he said, but can
tout it on the company's other stations, and bring to bear an army of
advertising sales people, promoters and artists. "I have resources
that a stand-alone station like this could never tap into. It would
never have the kind of glammed-out, gakked-out presentation we can
bring to it."</TE>
<TE>   For this battle, both sides have pulled out the biggest gun in the
genre's arsenal: Frank Sinatra. The new KLAC debuted on what would
have been Sinatra's 87th birthday, and planned 24 hours straight of
his music after Stewart's performance Thursday, while KSUR has been
airing the top 100 Sinatra songs as voted by its listeners.</TE>
<TE>   "They think they're going to pick up a much younger audience, and
they're not going to get it. Younger people are not going to listen
to music on AM," Levine said, citing his own research: the tastes of
his college-age son and daughter.</TE>
<TE>   But Laughlin said the new KLAC is banking on attracting younger
listeners, and believes that the swank, Vegas-style lounge trappings
that the company is draping on the station will lure them in and that
the music will keep them.</TE>
<TE>   "It has to be so compelling that 35-to-44-year-olds say, 'This is
cool. Now that's music,' " Laughlin said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Off the air</TE>
<TE>   The format change at KLAC had one effect before it even took
place. Southland talk-radio fixture Michael Jackson was off the air,
again. The talk pioneer, who was at KABC-AM (790) for 32 years until
he left in 1999 after being relegated to weekends, had his second
station change formats out from under him in two years. After leaving
KABC, he landed at what was formerly talk station KRLA-AM (1110), but
was forced off when ABC/Disney bought it in 2000 and changed it to
all-sports KSPN. He moved to KLAC and praised his colleagues there as
he left the air Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Talking to author Gore Vidal, his final guest, Jackson said he'd
speak to him again on the air, "Lord willing." Although he has
nothing new lined up yet, Jackson scotched any suggestion that he'll
retire. "Yes, I need to work. Yes, I want to work. I've got so much
more I want to do," Jackson said after his final show. "I am yearning
to get back on the air. I've been off for several hours now."</TE>
<TE>   He noted that with most talk radio hosts speaking from
conservative viewpoints, the airwaves could use a more liberal voice,
such as his -- especially with the looming prospect of war with Iraq.
"Shouldn't we -- even on just this one subject -- be hearing
alternative views?" Jackson asked.</TE>
<TE>   The only local talents on KLAC station were Jackson, morning drive
host Gil Gross and evening host Leslie Marshall; the station's other
programs were syndicated. As yet, Clear Channel has no plans to move
any of them to sister station KFI.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a good fan base," Laughlin said. "We're still trying to
find ways of incorporating them into the cluster."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he'll keep fans apprised through his Web site

<HD>On the edge of tragedy</HD>
<DH>Nicholson's performance and Payne's direction keep the
comedy 'About Schmidt' balanced between hope, despair.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Manohla Dargis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"About Schmidt" opens with a 66-year-old man staring at a second hand
sweep toward the last 5 o'clock of his working life. After years as
an executive in what he calls the "insurance game," Warren Schmidt
has reached the age of retirement and, like the packed boxes stacked
next to him, he's about to get junked. He's a nowhere man at the end
of his run and he might not grab your attention if not for the fact
that the senior citizen with the exquisitely anguished comb-over and
the potato physique is played by Jack Nicholson.</LD>
<LD>   With "About Schmidt," Nicholson at long last has another role big
enough for a movie star to get lost in. Based loosely on the novel by
Louis Begley, and adapted by Alexander Payne and his longtime writing
partner, Jim Taylor, "About Schmidt" tells the story of a Nebraska
native who, through various misadventures, finds himself -- or at
least some small portion of that self. A comedy poised on the knife's
edge of tragedy, the film is a gutsy, truthful, deeply rooted vision
of contemporary American life, scaled to the size of an ordinary man.
It's a humanist triumph strip-mined of bathos and confirmation that,
after directing just three features, Payne has become the most gifted
comic social satirist to hit our movies since Preston Sturges.</LD>
<TE>   We get a sense of Payne's ambitions as well as his comic
temperament the night of Warren's retirement. Along with his wife,
Helen (June Squibb), Schmidt attends a party in his honor at a
steakhouse. Surrounded by photos of blue-ribbon steers (Omaha's
future steaks), he listens as his young successor at Woodmen
Insurance (Matt Winston) lards on empty praise. Then Warren's friend
Ray (Len Cariou) unsteadily rises to deliver the words that lay out
the film's foundation. If a man has family and friends, says Ray,
lifting his glass, he can rest easy, knowing he has devoted his life
to something worthwhile. The guests politely applaud and a little
later Warren slips off to the restaurant bar for a drink, away from a
party that has turned into a requiem.</TE>
<TE>   Warren doesn't get time to enjoy or despair at retirement since
soon afterward Helen dies. Devastated, he wanders about like a
zombie, lost in grief but also just lost. After years of being
catered to, he barely knows how to feed himself much less clean up
his own mess. (He's a big baby: he likes his sandwich crusts
trimmed.) After he buries Helen and comforts his grown daughter,
Jeannie (Hope Davis), Warren makes a discovery about his marriage
that promptly leads him to fire up the couple's Winnebago. His
rationale for hitting the road is that he wants to persuade Jeannie
to break her engagement with Randall (Dermot Mulroney), a waterbed
salesman whom he loathes. In reality, what forces him out of the
house is what prompted him to flee his retirement party: Without
work, Warren has nowhere to turn.</TE>
<TE>   And so he drives, first toward Jeannie (who tells him to stay put
and wait for the wedding), then to the town in which he was born.
Before leaving, Warren had, in a fit of uncharacteristic generosity,
signed on to sponsor a Tanzanian orphan. Now, as he travels the flat
boundless countryside, he writes to the boy, Ndugu, describing his
trip, the places and the people, and spinning a version of his life
that never matches what we see on screen. Warren isn't a consciously
unreliable narrator; rather, he is comically, profoundly unconscious.
After a life of self-delusion, he can't separate the lies from the
truth. It's a comforting (and perhaps deeply American) fantasy that
the road trip leads to self-knowledge, but Payne knows better than to
give this emotionally cramped man such a fast out.</TE>
<TE>   Watching Nicholson behind the wheel, even of a monster RV, it's
impossible not to picture him in "Easy Rider." Initially, we keep
waiting for "Jack" to pop out of the character, to bring down the
house with a predatory grin or raise the roof with one of his
impishly expressive eyebrows; it doesn't happen. Nicholson never
fully disappears from view, but the icon moves far enough to the side
that we can see what makes Warren tick. In some respects, the
insurance man isn't that different from the all-American type the
actor played in "Easy Rider," except that instead of dying young and
pretty, Payne's Midwesterner followed a more familiar script: He got
married, had a kid, collected the gold watch.</TE>
<TE>   The costs of following that script too closely are evident in the
very opening of "About Schmidt," in a series of shots that show the
Woodmen building rising tall above a thicket of similarly anonymous
slabs. With each cut, Payne brings us closer to the building until
its menacing dark facade fills the frame, towering in the sky the way
that it has imposed over Warren day after day. Payne has an unadorned
visual style (he's a Midwesterner) but by the final thudding shot of
the building, the Woodmen tower looks eerily like the black monolith
that looms over the dying space traveler at the close of "2001." It's
an absurd allusion but also terrifying. After putting away his
youthful dreams, Warren spent his prime as a Woodman and now he can
barely move or feel. He needs a squirt of oil, desperately.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually he gets it. Warren makes it to Jeannie's side, where
he's unwillingly swept up in wedding preparations and the
ministrations of Randall's family, including that of the matriarch,
Roberta. As played by a sensational Kathy Bates, Roberta is a hippie
chick grown stolidly middle class, except that her house is cluttered
with lived-in furniture culled from second-hand shops. Warren is
horrified by everything Roberta says and does -- by her coarse
language, her messiness, her lust. "Look at these people," he shrieks
at his daughter. What Warren doesn't know (because he's not really
looking) is that Roberta has figured something out he never did. In a
world where work is god, dropping out has become a form of apostasy
-- as does looking at the wide, wonderful world outside the car
window or writing a $22 check to a starving child.</TE>
<TE>   Critics sometimes accuse Payne of condescending to his characters,
but perhaps what really bothers them is that Warren's life looks
painfully familiar. It's a sign of our diminished expectations for
American movies, as well as misguided political correctness, that
poking gentle fun at an unsympathetic character, even one as
deserving of it as Warren, can be seen as a betrayal of integrity.
(Nicholson spent his glory years, the 1970s, in plenty of roles that
were more unforgiving.) Payne does make gentle, sometimes broad fun
of Warren, Roberta and especially Randall, with his tragic mullet,
but the filmmaker never betrays or sells out his characters. Randall
may be ridiculous but he also loves Jeannie with an unselfishness
that is foreign to Warren. In "About Schmidt," love and kitsch are
always in the eye of the beholder.</TE>
<TE>   If "About Schmidt" were purely comic, Warren could easily have
become a figure of contempt; if Payne had gone for pathos, painting
the character along the same hopeless lines of a Willy Loman, the
film would have been excruciating. Perfectly pitched between comedy
and tragedy, hope and despair, "About Schmidt" instead comes far
closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live --
someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding
otherness. The great kindness that Payne bestows on Warren is the
chance, finally, to get out of his head, to abandon the narrow
self-interest that has, until the moment he writes the words "dear
Ndugu," whittled his life to so little. If only for a short while,
Schmidt sees the world beyond his own shadow.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Denny Zeitlin may well have felt a bit like Dr. Jennifer Melfi, the
psychiatrist in "The Sopranos," when he looked out at his Jazz Bakery
audience on Wednesday. In addition to being a world-class jazz
pianist, Zeitlin has been a working psychiatrist for decades.</LD>
<LD>   And when he saw the sparse audience, it wouldn't be surprising if
he encountered the same sort of abandonment transference experienced
by the fictional Dr. Melfi when Tony Soprano suddenly quit
psychotherapy.</LD>
<LD>   Zeitlin -- working in powerfully interactive fashion with bassist
Buster Williams and drummer Matt Wilson -- offered another of the
imaginative, envelope-stretching sets that have long been his stock
in trade.</LD>
<TE>   In his rendering of Wayne Shorter's "E.S.P.," for example, he
inserted an extraordinary solo passage, filled with a tumbling array
of rhapsodic harmonies interspersed with lightning-fast melodic
lines. His own tune, "Quiet Now," performed frequently by Bill Evans,
was restored to Zeitlin's repertoire for the first time in years and
offered in a harmonic setting vastly different from, but no less
appealing than, Evans' approach to the piece. And the soaring,
lyrical renderings of "You Don't Know What Love Is" and the
children's tune "Put Your Little Foot Right Out," revealed more of
Zeitlin's superb talents.</TE>
<TE>   Hearing this fine artist perform before a small audience raised
the question of how much the maintenance of his parallel careers has
taken away from his visibility as a musical artist.</TE>

<HD>In the halftime groove</HD>
<DH>The plot may be familiar, but 'Drumline' enthusiastically
marches viewers into a football spectacle little seen outside of the
South: the show-stopping college band.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every holiday season needs a pleasant surprise, and this year it's
"Drumline." This entertaining and enthusiastically told tale shrewdly
energizes its way-familiar plot line by setting it amid one of the
greatest and least-known spectacles in American sports.</LD>
<LD>   That would be the world of show-style marching bands, which is a
football season way of life during halftimes at such predominantly
black Southern colleges and universities as Florida A&amp;M and
Grambling.</LD>
<LD>   With upward of 300 gorgeously costumed and elaborately
choreographed band members and dancers putting on pulsating
seven-minute spectacles, it's no wonder that fans often care as much
about the shows as the football games that surround them. Given a
setting this intrinsically cinematic, it would be hard for a film to
go far wrong, and "Drumline" doesn't.</LD>
<TE>   Although the story of a brash kid who needs to come to terms with
authority has seen umpteen formulaic reincarnations, writers Tina
Gordon Chism and Shawn Schepps and director Charles Stone III (of
"Paid in Full" and the "Whassup?" beer commercials) treat it as if
it's never been done. Which, given how infrequently the world of
black Southern colleges has been put on film (Spike Lee did it with
"School Daze" in 1988), just might be true.</TE>
<TE>   The film has also been smart in picking its lively, likable cast,
starting with Nick Cannon (of TV's "The Nick Cannon Show") as Devon,
a drummer from Harlem who gets a full scholarship to the mythical
Atlanta A&amp;T University to help reinvigorate its marching band.</TE>
<TE>   Right off the bat, the film establishes Devon as a good kid who's
serious about his music and who's had the disadvantage of growing up
without a father. This is important because the young man is also an
incurable wiseacre who's so enamored of his own talent that he
doesn't understand that, to put it bluntly, there is no I in band.
This gets him in trouble with drum-line section leader Sean (Leonard
Roberts) and even grates a little on the beautiful band dance
captain, Laila (Zoe Saldana), on whom he has a serious crush.</TE>
<TE>   The film's pivotal character is Dr. Lee (the gifted Orlando Jones,
capable of making decency sexy) as the school's musical director with
the motto of "one band, one sound." An articulate believer in
musicianship above all else, the doctor has to contend with not only
difficult Devon but also a college president who wants the band to be
livelier and do better in the annual Big Southern Classic, the Super
Bowl of show-style marching band competitions.</TE>
<TE>   In its attempt to cover as many bases as possible, "Drumline" ends
up with a few too many plot lines, even one about the problems of one
of the film's token white guys.</TE>
<TE>   Still, when the bands are marching and playing, that doesn't seem
to matter. If rhythm and movement are important to you, this is a
film that deserves a spot on your dance card.</TE>

<HD>Decor fit for a despot</HD>
<DH>Saddam Hussein's Al Sajoud Palace is a monument to excess
on the Tigris River.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Eastman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As U.N. inspectors looked for what wasn't immediately visible at
Saddam Hussein's Al Sajoud Palace in Iraq last week, we couldn't help
but notice what's plain as day: the over-the-top architecture and
decor. It's a mix of something from each chapter of the international
"Hey, I Have Money and Power" design book for despots. The palace,
part of a vast compound on the Tigris River, has Islamic touches from
Moroccan to Indian, a bit of Italian Renaissance and even a
sprinkling of Vegas glitter.</LD>
<LD>   The half-mile-long brick exterior contains a series of pointed
arches, part of an architectural style introduced during the 8th
century Abbasid dynasty when Baghdad was the center of the Arab
world. Seen from the air, the marble walls that outline waterways and
gardens take on the shape of a giant peacock. The overall effect, say
architecture experts, is of Saddam saying he's next in line to rule
an empire descended from this ancient city.</LD>
<LD>   It's estimated he has spent $2 billion in the last decade building
and remodeling at least 78 presidential palaces, thought by many to
be hiding weapons caches and worse. As one U.S. State Department
spokesman says, these are no Sleeping Beauty castles. Neither are
they bastions of tasteful restraint.</LD>

<HD>A spirited memorial for Ray Brown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ray Brown last performed at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill in February. But
there was an almost palpable sense of his presence at the club on
Tuesday, when the Killer Trio All Stars Plus One opened a weeklong
tribute to the great bassist, who died in July.</LD>
<LD>   Guitarist Russell Malone, pianist Monty Alexander, bassist John
Clayton and drummer Jeff Hamilton were logical choices for the
musical salute. Malone and Alexander appeared with Brown on his final
recording, and Clayton and Hamilton were his frequent musical
companions. Adding more authenticity to the program, much of the
music was either written by or closely associated with Brown.</LD>
<LD>   Interestingly, it was Alexander, who had the longest musical
relationship with Brown, and Malone, who had the shortest, who best
captured the ebullient musicality that characterized Brown's every
note.</LD>
<TE>   Alexander's soloing, accompanied by his fervent grunting and
humming, reached from soulful, gospel-tinged blues and sweetly
lyrical balladry to the buoyant rhythms of his Jamaican homeland.</TE>
<TE>   Malone could do no wrong. His improvising had the quality, as it
always does, of instant composition, with his fascinating melody
lines filled with inner thematic relationships, driven by his
powerful rhythmic drive.</TE>
<TE>   Clayton, with the unenviable task of following in the footsteps of
his mentor and friend, played some of the familiar Brown lines with a
deep understanding of their musical source. But he would be the first
to note that there was only one Ray Brown.</TE>

<KH>WORLD MUSIC</KH>
<HD>Sampling standouts from around the globe</HD>
<DH>This year's outpouring of diverse recordings makes up for a
lack of live shows in the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fans of world music found their choices more limited than usual in
2002, at least in terms of live performance. Numerous acts either
encountered visa problems in the post-Sept. 11 world or simply
decided to avoid altogether the increased complications of traveling
to the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, their recordings had no such problems, and the choice
of sounds from every part of the globe was as diverse and compelling
as ever.</LD>
<LD>   Picking a best-of-the-year list from 2002's flow of CDs, given the
diversity that is the very nature of world music, would be next to
impossible. Instead, here is a personal collection of the year's
favorites, chosen to be as stylistically and geographically varied as
possible.</LD>
<TE>   The list begins with solo artists, first from South America, then
moves to Cape Verde, and Africa, with stops in Europe and beyond:</TE>
<TE>   Caetano Veloso, "Live in Bahia" (Nonesuch). It's appropriate that
in his mature artistry, the Brazilian now defines the quest for
creative eclecticism that was one of the goals of tropicalismo, the
movement he was instrumental in founding in the late '60s. This
marvelous two-CD set displays the infinite variety of Veloso's art,
from the passionate political statements of "Noites do Norte,"
"Haiti" and "Tigresa" to the soulful revisiting of bossa nova in his
reading of Antonio Carlos Jobim's "Caminos Cruzados." But there's
much more, all of it the work of one of the world's great musical
artists.</TE>
<TE>   Cesaria Evora, "The Very Best of Cesaria Evora" (RCA Victor). The
barefoot diva from Cape Verde probably never imagined that she'd be
around long enough to produce a greatest-hits album, but here it is.
Interestingly, it includes a new version of the song that has become
her theme, "Sodade," and the version of "Crepuscular Solidao" omits
the guitar and voice of Bonnie Raitt, present on the original
release. But with the baffling exception of "Miss Perfumado," there
are plenty of other familiar items featuring Evora's captivating
sound and manner.</TE>
<TE>   Salif Keita, "Moffou" (Universal). Keita's high, soaring voice is
one of the most distinctive sounds to emerge from the enormous
musical multiplicity of Africa. It is heard to particular advantage
in this largely acoustic set, which emphasizes Keita's griot-like
storytelling powers rather than the considerably less intriguing
Afro-pop rhythms that have dominated his recent live appearances. The
album opens with an engaging duet between Keita and Evora.</TE>
<TE>   Mariza, "Fado em Mim" (Times Square). The tall, blond, visually
striking Mariza, still only in her 20s, has already established
herself as one of the most gifted of the young generation of fado
singers. Departing less from traditional style than some of her
contemporaries, she renders fados such as "Maria Lisboa" and "Barco
Negro" in a fashion strongly reminiscent of the great Amalia
Rodrigues. But she does so with a distinctly individual touch,
remaining true to tradition -- on these as well as more modern fados
-- while retaining a 21st century perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Milagro Acustico, "I Storie o cafe di lu Furestiero" (Tinder). The
Roman group, led by Sicilian saxophonist Bob Salmieri, is joined by
African musicians Pape Kanoute, Nour-Eddine and others in an imagined
evening in a Sicilian cafe. And for once, the fusion of genres
actually works, with Italian melodies, African rhythms, Middle
Eastern modes and a touch of Miles Davis-like trumpet blending into a
compelling tapestry of boundary-less music.</TE>
<TE>   Altan, "The Blue Idol" (Narada World). With a stirring, two-violin
front line leading the way, and the poignant voice of Mairead Ni
Mhaonaigh adding her touching balladry, Altan can seemingly do no
wrong. This time out, they have enhanced the mix by adding guest
appearances by singer-songwriter Paul Brady and Dolly Parton
(gorgeously singing "The Pretty Young Girl"). The result is an
irresistible feast of Celtic musical pleasures.</TE>
<TE>   Next, a few impressive collections of artists in single packages:</TE>
<TE>   Various artists, "Red, Hot and Riot" (MCA). Dedicated to the
memory of Nigeria's Fela Kuti, the latest in the "Red, Hot" series is
a stunning gathering of global artists performing unique renditions
of Kuti's music. Among them, Brazil's Jorge Ben Jor, Senegal's Baaba
Maal, American jazz artist Archie Shepp, Nigerian-born,
English-reared Sade and, on one remarkable track, an aggregation
including Kuti's son Femi Kuti, D'Angelo, Macy Gray, Nile Rodgers and
Roy Hargrove. Proceeds are directed to the millions of HIV-infected
Africans.</TE>
<TE>   Various, "Rai Superstars" (Mondo Melodia/Ark21). An entertaining
overview of the Algerian popular music analogous to the blues,
protest music, rap and balladry. Recorded for the most part
throughout the '90s, with a pair of fascinating tracks dating to the
'80s, a violently unsettled period in which rai became the expression
of anti-government protest, Khaled, one of the principal voices of
that era, is included here, as well as Cheb Mami, Cheb Nasro and the
veteran female rai artist Cheikha Remitta.</TE>
<TE>   Various, "World 2002" (Narada World). If you can only manage a
single world music purchase for this year's gift list, here's the
most inclusive choice. In two CDs, Narada has circled the globe,
including tracks by such familiar names as Mariza, Salif Keita,
Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Manu Chao, Rachid Taha and Chava Alberstein.
Also represented are lesser-known but equally compelling artists such
as Yat Kha (Tuva), Gigi (Ethiopia), Amal Murkus (Palestine) and Sabah
Habas Mustapha (Indonesia).</TE>

<HD>Crows make the best of adversity</HD>
<DH>The band plays beautifully despite drummer Ben Mize's
sudden illness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Hochman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the best measures of a band's character is how it handles
something going wrong in a concert.</LD>
<LD>   Counting Crows met such a test with mettle Tuesday at the
Universal Amphitheatre when drummer Ben Mize was taken ill about half
an hour before the show's conclusion.</LD>
<LD>   Mize and four of his bandmates left the stage, leaving flustered
singer Adam Duritz and guitarist Dave Immergluck to play a personable
version of obscure '60s folksinger Jackson C. Frank's "Blues Run the
Game." After departing momentarily, Duritz returned and explained
that there had been a "medical problem" and that Mize was done for
the night. (The illness didn't prove serious; Mize rejoined the group
Wednesday at the Wiltern.) And with that the group went into
unplugged -- and unplanned -- mode, throwing out the set list and
stepping into uncharted waters, including their first-ever acoustic
version of "Perfect Blue Buildings" from their 1993 debut album.
Midway through the song, Randy Guss, the drummer for opening act Toad
the Wet Sprocket, slipped behind the kit. Duritz, surprised, turned
around and with a big grin gave Guss the OK sign.</LD>
<TE>   Not to wish ill on anyone, but this band might benefit from
something unforeseen every night. As much as the group works to tap
into the mystique of such heroes as Bob Dylan and Van Morrison,
there's a staid predictability to both the music and lyrical imagery.
Having to cover for the missing drummer took the band out of its game
and put it into the moment.</TE>
<TE>   Toad the Wet Sprocket has been out of the game entirely for five
years but has recently reunited. Tuesday's crisp set made the case
for the Santa Barbara foursome as the inventor of this particular
game, having streamlined R.E.M.'s approach, buffing off the arty
edges and pointing the way for Crows, Matchbox Twenty and many
others.</TE>

<HD>Political talk that takes its cue from late-night TV</HD>
<DH>ON TELEVISION / Howard Rosenberg</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mr. Egg Nog faced the camera and threw America a smile, sharing the
small screen with a woman playing "White Christmas" on a grand piano.</LD>
<LD>   It was warm, it was cozy, it was intimate.</LD>
<LD>   "What a first show we have," said the host of "After Hours with
Cal Thomas" on the Fox News Channel, "with guests Michael Feinstein
and Mr. Vice President, Dick Cheney!"</LD>
<TE>   Cal who? Host of what? On what? Yes, that's right. Showing their
sense of humor, and getting in touch with their inner Hyohhhhhh!,
Fox's "fair and balanced" cut-ups now have themselves a late night
show on Saturdays. Well, not quite late night out here where it airs
at 8 p.m., three hours earlier than in the East. And no one's playing
stump the band, either.</TE>
<TE>   But it does feel late night, with "staff pianist" Lauren Green --
who spends her mornings as a Fox News anchor -- moonlighting on those
tinkly ivories and Thomas -- the conservative syndicated columnist
whose favorite targets include the Liberal Media -- as twinkly as
Christmas lights in his new role as impresario of shmooze.</TE>
<TE>   "If you prefer conversation to confrontation and something new and
different to the same old-same old," he said at the top of last
week's premiere, "this is your kind of show."</TE>
<TE>   Was his reference to "confrontation" a tiny slam of Fox's
tumultuous Bill O'Reilly and bickering "Hannity &amp; Colmes," or more
likely meant for the screaming barbarians of left and right on CNN's
"Crossfire?"</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the case, there's something symbolic about Fox's new
toastier, fuzzier after-hours Cal. Among the more exotic political
phenomena of this age are Leno, Letterman and other late-nighters
becoming rites of passage for politicians on the stump, from blues
man Bill Clinton selling himself to young urban blacks by blowing his
sax on "The Arsenio Hall Show" some years ago to George Bush and Al
Gore sparring in 2000 with Letterman, who self-mockingly boasted:
"The road to the White House runs through me."</TE>
<TE>   It's as if Americans were expected to measure their national
leaders by their quips instead of their policies, the usual routine
being for a candidate to get drilled repeatedly in the host's
monologue, then arrive in person for a whimsical rapprochement.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas is not on that laugh track. And somehow, you can't envision
a comedy monologue in his future, although he did open his first show
by reciting one of his columns that at least one viewer (blush) found
pretty funny. The best he could do on Saturday was a condemnation of
people "stripping away ... America's heritage" by substituting "happy
holidays" for "Merry Christmas" and "Happy Hanukkah."</TE>
<TE>   Well, if you have to be mad at something ....</TE>
<TE>   What roads lead through Thomas remain to be seen as he approaches
his second Saturday with guest E. Harold Ford Jr., the Tennessee
congressman who recently lost his bid to become House Democratic
leader. Thomas' hybrid new show does straddle two universes. When he
promises viewers politics, opinion and, yes, "even some
entertainment," it's not CBS or NBC that's paying him to say it, but
the nation's most popular cable news channel. The ivories and news
sharing a set? You half expected Thomas to sing Christmas carols and
invite the Fox news staff in to bob for apples.</TE>
<TE>   Not that there has ever been much of a line separating politics
from show biz.</TE>
<TE>   Just as news and entertainment are moving ever closer, politics
and entertainment offer careers that are nearly interchangeable.
Think anti-Vietnam War crusaders on "The Smothers Brothers Comedy
Hour" in the 1960s. Think Ronald Reagan as California governor and
president. Think Charlton Heston as drum major for the NRA. Think Mr.
Republican Arnie Schwarzenegger. Think Tennessee Republican Fred
Thompson trading his Senate seat recently for a regular gig on NBC's
"Law &amp; Order."</TE>
<TE>   And don't forget this week's tailored-for-TV event staged by
Artists United to Win Without War, with Martin Sheen, David Duchovny,
Gillian Anderson, Laurence Fishburne, Mike Farrell and other show biz
figures coming forward to denounce Bush's saber-rattling aimed at
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   So when soon-to-be-Senate-Minority-Leader-again Tom Daschle
recently blasted conservative radio talker Rush Limbaugh and
"Limbaugh wannabes" for wisecracks that blurred "entertainment and
politics," the South Dakota Democrat was ignoring a long tradition of
his own party. By the way, does anyone recall Daschle or any other
Democrat protesting when Letterman called Bush a "boob" during the
2000 presidential campaign?</TE>
<TE>   Not a peep.</TE>
<TE>   And so it was that Thomas sat down with Cheney at "his place" for
what he termed a "friendly conversation." Very, very friendly, with
the vice president settling back in his chair like Santa Claus and an
adoring Thomas mentally sitting on his lap while lobbing him
softballs.</TE>
<TE>   After that, it was time for performer Feinstein to "do what he so
often does after hours," Thomas announced, "sing us a song." So there
it was, the Fox News Channel -- "fair and balanced" and, thanks to
Feinstein's singing, for once not off-key.</TE>
<TE>   Happy holidays, Cal.</TE>

<HD>An anchorman with attitude</HD>
<DH>Fox News Channel's Shepard Smith hasn't let an on-air gaffe
put a dent in his career arc.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Jensen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Shepard Smith, the news anchor with the fastest Mississippi drawl on
television, has been a rising star in cable news this year: The Fox
News Channel personality has the top-rated newscast (as opposed to
talk show), and in October and November his "Fox Report" passed CNN's
Larry King to take the No. 3 spot overall. He's ahead so far this
month too.</LD>
<LD>   But there's always room for more viewers. So when Smith tripped
over his tongue on a newscast the day before election day and blurted
out a vulgar phrase for a sex act in a report about singer Jennifer
Lopez possibly returning to her old neighborhood for a block party,
the PR team saw its opening. As links to recordings of the mistake
became a staple online, keeping the incident fresh in people's minds
for weeks, the gaffe became part of the pitch to reporters on why
they should write about the anchor.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps because Fox was so quick to exploit the situation, many
industry rivals are convinced the flub was a deliberate play for
attention. Smith insists that it was a mistake, one that happened
because he hadn't read the news copy in advance of delivering it on
the air. The incident, which drew thousands of e-mails, was "really
awful," he says. "I would never do anything like that on television
intentionally."</LD>
<TE>   He left the New York studio that day and called his boss to
apologize, then canceled a dinner and went home to look at the
e-mails, trying to figure out if his career was over (in the end,
just 3% of the mail was negative, he says). "I was real embarrassed.
We do a lot of joking on our show, but our show can't become a joke."</TE>
<TE>   Smith, 38, more often earns high marks for being an almost perfect
match to his renegade employer. He anchors a noon hour, but it's the
4 p.m. "Fox Report" that is his focus. It's a newscast with attitude
(although he chafes at a recent description of him as "cocky," saying
that the phrase applies to Fox, but not him). "Fox Report" is a
fast-paced hour that first looks seriously at the serious stories of
the day, then wraps up with features like "Around the World in 80
Seconds" and the "G Block" of entertainment and sports briefs.</TE>
<TE>   The program draws 1.4 million viewers on average per night,
according to Nielsen ratings to date for the fourth quarter, and is
particularly popular with young men, with whom it ranks second in
cable news to Fox's "The O'Reilly Factor," which immediately follows
it. Fox is trying to translate his popularity to its broadcast
network, where Smith will again anchor the newsmagazine "The Pulse,"
when the summer program returns in January with a new studio, new
music and new format, he says.</TE>
<TE>   One rival sneers that Smith's program is merely " 'Headline News'
with an editorializing quip"; Smith says he wants his newscast, which
will also move to a new studio in March, to move even faster than it
already does. "If you can tell a story in 10, 12, 15 seconds, then
move on," he says. "If [viewers] want in-depth 40 column inches on
something, I can tell them where to go." He describes what he does on
the program as getting to "shoot it out of a cannon; it's
automatic-weapon television. We're not going to waste your time."</TE>
<TE>   Smith was raised in a much slower environment, the
population-7,000 town of Holly Springs, Miss., which he likes to say
had no McDonald's or movie theater. He knew he wanted to be on
television when he saw a live report in 1977 on the death of Elvis
Presley and was impressed with the immediacy. He started out at the
tiny Panama City, Fla., NBC station, where he had to do it all:
"Shoot, edit, write, produce and set up the truck." (His favorite
stories are still about "little old ladies and the roofers. You track
down the roofer and get the money back and get someone thrown in
jail.")</TE>
<TE>   Stints in Fort Myers, Fla., and Orlando led him to a street
reporter's job at WSVN in Miami, a Fox station that gained national
attention for its seven hours a day of news, delivered in a
fast-paced graphic style augmented by slow motion and dramatic music.
"You learned to take a lot of information and get a story on
quickly," Smith says. The style was criticized by many, he concedes.
"They would bash you and bash you and bash you -- and then copy you.
A little bit like Fox."</TE>
<TE>   Smith joined the syndicated "A Current Affair" in its last months,
moved to reporting for Fox's affiliate stations in 1996 and then came
to Fox News Channel, where he got his first anchoring job. He says
his approach is to call it as it is: "If it's crazy and outlandish,
treat it that way. If it's serious and important, treat it that way.
There's no reason news has to be delivered in a monotone."</TE>
<TE>   And he has choice words for the "NewsHour with Jim Lehrer" folks
who cited his tendency to speak in phrases without verbs: "Shut uuup.
When we mess up the facts, call me. We're not going to do it the
boring way."</TE>

<HD>There's sly humor in 'The Hot Chick'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the surface "The Hot Chick" is not so hot: loud, vulgar and
contrived, for starters. But beneath its crass veneer, this film,
from Adam Sandler's Happy Madison production company, proves as
provocatively subversive as his "Eight Crazy Nights." Its opening is
a groaner, for it turns upon that shopworn device of a body exchange.
In this instance, due to a pair of purloined earrings, Abyssinian BC
artifacts possessing magical powers, Jessica (Rachel McAdams), a
mean-spirited high school campus queen, finds herself trapped inside
the body of an unprepossessing lowlife convenience store robber (Rob
Schneider).</LD>
<LD>   As it happens, the crook doesn't mind ending up in the body of
Jessica, for the switch allows him to embark upon a lucrative career
as a go-go dancer who brutally exploits customers and who poses as a
streetwalker, mugging unsuspecting johns.</LD>
<LD>   For Jessica, however, it's hellish. What is a girl to do, with the
statewide cheerleading competition and the senior prom coming up,
when she suddenly looks like Rob Schneider? The new Jessica takes
into confidence her best friend, April (Anna Faris), and shares her
bizarre predicament.</LD>
<TE>   They first of all have to come up with explanations for Jessica's
seeming absence, and Jessica in her new form manages to land a gig
with her own father (Michael O'Keefe), a gardener, and a job as a
janitor at her high school.</TE>
<TE>   Because no amount of cosmetic trickery is going to pass the crook
off as Jessica, "she" and April give up on that idea. This leaves
Jessica coming across as an effeminate gay man, and it's easy to
guess what kind of jokes are in the offing. But, before homophobia
can set in, director Tom Brady and Schneider, who co-wrote the
script, reveal the new Jessica, a sissified male, emerging as a gutsy
stand-up guy who calls himself Spence. He's a veritable Mary Worth of
wisdom, assuring Jessica's mother (Melora Hardin) that her husband
still finds her desirable and showing acceptance rather than ridicule
for Jessica's kid brother, who has gender issues of his own.</TE>
<TE>   That Billy (Matthew Lawrence) and Jake (Eric Christian Olsen),
Jessica and April's erstwhile football star boyfriends, find Spence's
effeminacy threatening makes them look ridiculous and insecure.</TE>
<TE>   In short, the filmmakers have sly fun with all sorts of
gender-bending possibilities, suggesting that maybe there's something
to be said for people accepting themselves and one another as they
are.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, April and a couple of Jessica's most trusted pals
understandably start trying to figure out how to get Jessica back
into her own body. Happily, the film's wind-up proceeds with more
ease and dispatch than its opening.</TE>
<TE>   Faris, who survived "Scary Movie 2," emerges as a young actress of
much promise, and the same could be said of Rachel McAdams in her
first sizable role. As for Schneider, he may be obnoxious and
unhandsome, but he is, more important, talented and fearless, the
driving force of this brash, not-so-predictable comedy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'The Hot Chick'</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for crude and sexual humor, language and drug
references</TE>
<TE>   Times guidelines: Satire of gender-bending attitudes mixed with
extremely crude, broad humor; heavy on bodily function jokes but not
mean-spirited, sure to offend some yet harmless</TE>

<HD>'Adaptation' effects: seamless, unsung</HD>
<DH>Smooth movie magic from Gray Matter FX keeps viewers'
attention on characters and story.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one is talking about the effects in "Adaptation," which suits
director Spike Jonze and visual effects supervisor Gray Marshall just
fine.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not like a 'Star Wars' movie where everybody comes out
talking about the effects," says Jonze. "He did such a good job that
he made himself invisible. It's like a magic trick; you don't know
there is a trick happening here because your attention is focused
somewhere else."</LD>
<LD>   In the case of "Adaptation," which opened last Friday to mostly
rave reviews, audiences know that it is just one actor -- Nicolas
Cage -- playing the twin screenwriters Charlie and Donald Kaufman.
But Jonze says "what we focused our energy on was the brothers and
their relationship and who they are as individuals and how they react
toward each other. That was always our goal, that what you pay
attention to is the brothers' relationship, not that the same actor
is playing each part."</LD>
<TE>   To help him achieve his naturalistic vision for the film, Jonze
called on Marshall and the Venice-based company he co-owns, Gray
Matter FX. Marshall and Gray Matter also did the effects for Jonze's
1999 hit, "Being John Malkovich."</TE>
<TE>   In order to make the twin sequences seamless and unaffected,
Marshall and his company shied away from using the popular
green-screen method in which a subject is first filmed on a green
background.</TE>
<TE>   The green screen is then removed either optically or digitally,
allowing the subject to be isolated for compositing with another
element.</TE>
<TE>   Gray Matter relied more on split screen, motion-control cameras
and rotoscoping. The latter, says Marshall, "is a big fancy word for
trace by hand. You have to accurately trace wherever there is an
overlap [of each person] so it looks seamless and smooth."</TE>
<TE>   Besides creating the twin sequences, Gray Matter also worked on
digitally tightening scenes and creating a computer-generated bee for
a 40-second sequence.</TE>
<TE>   The reason Marshall and his team used green screen for only 20% of
the 130 "twinning" shots of Charlie and Donald was "a green screen
should be set up under fairly controlled conditions. If it isn't, we
can have a lot of downside which is splashing green all over the set.
That's what we call contamination or green spill."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes "the locations we used were practical" for using green
screen, but frequently they did not have enough room to put a green
screen in.</TE>
<TE>   Before production began Jonze spent three weeks working with Cage
to create each brother. "Gray was involved from the very beginning,"
Jonze says. "After we would block out a scene we would shoot photo
storyboards and talk to him about how we were going to do each shot.
The amount of time you have on the set is so precious in terms of the
amount of time you have to shoot a scene. I think he knew going into
it that the performance had to be alive and couldn't be burdened with
more technical stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Which twin was shot first was based on many factors.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it has to do with physical blocking," says Jonze. "If
there was a scene where Donald is walking around the room and the
motion-control camera would have to follow Donald, then we would have
to shoot Donald's scenes first because that is going to motivate the
camera movement."</TE>
<TE>   In other scenes, "There wasn't as much physical movement," Jonze
says. "It was more who drove the conversation energy-wise. If one
person is leading the conversation and one person is reacting more,
we would shoot the person who is leading first."</TE>
<TE>   "The great thing about Spike is that he doesn't try to overdo" the
effects, says Marshall. "He would have been just as happy if he had
found an actor the caliber he wanted who just happened to be twins.
So Spike's great gift is his ability to not fall in love with effects
but use them when it is appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall also worked with the film's editor, Eric Zumbrunnen, on
the final edit of the film using computers to alter the pacing and
timing and tighten certain scenes. "It came out of the collaboration
comfort level that we have achieved with Eric and Spike," Marshall
says. "Typically part of an editor's job is to control the pacing and
it's also the director's job to control the pacing of the scene but
often things change when you go to edit. You find out how things work
together. Traditionally the way an editor changes the pacing is where
they choose to cut and cut away from. We are finding ways to tighten
things up, to speed things up or in some cases to slow things down
without cutting away from the shot, staying in the shot."</TE>
<TE>   "We could create pauses or shorten pauses," says Jonze. "It was a
huge help in terms of making the performance more natural. Those
ideas started with things we were doing with Charlie and Donald, and
once we saw how easy it was for Gray to do it, we realized we could
use the tool to fix other problems."</TE>
<TE>   It took Marshall and his bee team of animators five months to
create a bee looking for honey among orchids in a scene between
co-stars Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably when you watch the movie you are totally unaware of the
bee," says Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   Creating the bee was the most interactive work he did with Jonze.</TE>
<TE>   "We started with the rough form of the bee. The challenges were it
had fur and it had to be interactive with the flower and it had to
move like a bee."</TE>
<TE>   That was easier said than done.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Marshall says, the bee was "acting too much." In fact,
when Jonze saw early footage of the bee he told Marshall to make the
insect "dumber."</TE>
<TE>   "Our initial bee had too much character and was too conscious of
what it was doing," says Marshall. "Once we realized bees were clumsy
and we made it less deliberate, it came alive. "</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>LONDON -- Film fans beware. This could prove to be an expensive
Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   Four helmets from the original "Star Wars" blockbuster 25 years
ago will vie for top billing with Jack Nicholson's jacket from "The
Shining" and Pierce Brosnan's Omega watch from "The World Is Not
Enough" at a movie memorabilia sale next week.</LD>
<LD>   But they will also have to do battle with a black satin jacket
worn by Marilyn Monroe for a 1956 photo shoot, props from the
original "Alien" film and Tom Hanks' replica tommy gun from "Saving
Private Ryan" among 217 lots at auction on Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   "The 'Star Wars' material is very rare. These helmets are from the
original film and were made by Shepperton Design Studios in London,"
auction house Christie's film memorabilia expert Sarah Hodgson said
at a sale preview Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The four items are a white storm-trooper's helmet and an Imperial
fighter-pilot's helmet -- both priced at about $4,700 -- an
Imperial-forces helmet and a prototype rebel-fighter pilot's helmet
at about $1,600 each.</TE>
<TE>   But they will face stiff competition from the burgundy bomber
jacket worn by Nicholson in the 1980 cult movie "The Shining," priced
at about $4,700.</TE>
<TE>   "Nicholson memorabilia hardly ever comes onto the market, so we
are very lucky to have this," Hodgson said. "And 'The Shining' has
such a strong cult following."</TE>
<TE>   The stainless-steel Omega watch worn by Brosnan as James Bond in
the 1999 film is expected to fetch up to $19,000, while Hanks'
replica machine gun is a more modest $1,900.</TE>
<TE>   They will have to tough it out against mementos of hardy perennial
Marilyn Monroe, including the black jacket, sheer nylon stockings,
photographs, letters, a pair of stiletto shoes and a chiffon scarf
priced variously between $945 and $11,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with all film memorabilia items is proving their
origin," Hodgson said. "We turn away 50% of the stuff we are offered
because of problems with provenance."</TE>

<HD>'Maid' a disposable Cinderella story</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Manohla Dargis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As saccharine as it is disposable, this pillow mint of a movie stars
Jennifer Lopez as Marisa Ventura, a single mom from the Bronx who
catches the eye of an ambitious politician, Christopher Marshall
(Ralph Fiennes), while working as a maid in a swank Park Avenue
hotel. Marshall, a world-class Lothario and the scion of a political
dynasty, accidentally takes Marisa for the wealthy ninny (Natasha
Richardson) encamped in a neighboring suite.</LD>
<LD>   The mistake yields a romantic walk in the park, a minor tabloid
tempest but finally no surprises, this despite the odd-couple pairing
of Lopez, a performer born for the spotlight, and Fiennes, an actor
who invariably seems pained when cast as a romantic lead.</LD>
<TE>   Written by Kevin Wade (whose credits include "Working Girl") and
directed by Wayne Wang (best known for "The Joy Luck Club"), "Maid in
Manhattan" is blithely impersonal. There's a touch of grit,
especially in Marisa's home life, and an occasional reminder of some
guiding intelligence (her commuter reading consists of "The Drama of
the Gifted Child"), but nothing too heavy or complex to get in the
way of either the emotional uplift or the star attraction. Lopez
doesn't have to do much except hold the screen, which she does
effortlessly. You can't take your eyes off her even when your
attention drifts, but it would be nice to see her again take on a
role where she actually works for our attention and earns our
respect, as she did in "Out of Sight."</TE>
<TE>   The supporting cast helps pass the time, notably Bob Hoskins as
the hotel's head butler and Marissa Matrone as Marisa's motor-mouthed
cleaning partner. There's something appealing about the film's
sympathetic attitude toward these characters, who spend their days
anonymously opening doors and mopping up other people's messes, even
if the point of this fairy tale is, finally, to escape their fate as
quickly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   In this limited sense, "Maid in Manhattan" is certainly an
improvement on the usual Cinderella fantasies furnished by the likes
of "Pretty Woman," especially since Marisa doesn't have to turn
tricks on her way to the fancy-dress ball. That this particular
chambermaid also doesn't scrub a single toilet, however, somehow goes
without saying.</TE>

<LD>What I remember most about the place isn't the neatly aligned
wood-and-brick cottages or the well-tended gardens, or even the
colorful mosaic tiles that gleamed in the autumn sunlight. What I
remember most are the eyes of the children that reflected needs
beyond one's ability to measure.The boys and girls, ages 6 to 12,
from broken homes or parentless homes or homes filled with fear and
violence, were sent by the courts to Hollygrove, a residential
treatment center for children who have become society's
responsibility.</LD>
<LD>   The center sits on 3 1/2 acres off Vine Street in Hollywood, so
near and yet so far from the film studios where dreams are made. It
began in 1880 as an orphanage in what is now Chinatown and moved to
its present location in 1911. Marilyn Monroe, then Norma Jean Baker,
was a resident here in the mid-1930s, a frail little girl with a
hesitant smile whose visage blends into a wall of pictures down a
long hallway.</LD>
<LD>   I visited Hollygrove because it's partially supported by money
from the Los Angeles Times Holiday Campaign. The executive director,
Judith Nelson, walked me through the grounds of the home, through its
offices and assessment center, its cottages and cafeteria, its
playroom and school room. A full-time staff of 157 professionals care
for the 68 young people at the center and 30 more in foster homes.</LD>
<TE>   "The children who come here almost always have severe behavioral
problems," Nelson said. She's a handsome, middle-aged woman with a
master's degree in social work and a law degree. No child passed by
that she didn't speak to and hug. No child passed by whose name she
didn't know. "By the time they get here they're either extremely
angry or withdrawn," she said. "They've been in five or six different
places already and have failed, or have been failed by the system."</TE>
<TE>   The aim of Hollygrove is to give the children hope. Nelson calls
it offering them horizons, something beyond their present
circumstances. The center works toward giving them normal lives in
rehabilitated homes, foster homes or adoptive homes.</TE>
<TE>   One success story involves a shy, withdrawn 12-year-old boy who
became interested in theatrical productions put on by the children.
He was encouraged to join a show and ended up displaying an
extraordinary talent for singing, dancing and acting. This won him a
small part in a TV series and, more important, the heart of an actor
who has begun adoption proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been criticized for putting the boy 'in movies,' " Nelson
said, "but it wasn't just about choosing a career. It was about
giving him choices. Now he has a horizon, where once he had no
sunrises at all."</TE>
<TE>   A cadre of volunteers helps at the home. Some adults become
"special friends" of the kids, focusing attention on individual
residents of Hollygrove. Grants and donations fuel the center's
$11-million annual budget. Almost 85% of it comes from county, state
and federal agencies, and the rest, Nelson said, from "wherever we
can find it" -- including monies from the Monroe estate for the care
she once received.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson calls Hollygrove a treatment facility, refusing to
stigmatize her children as orphans or problem kids. But she teaches
as she protects, insisting that both the youngsters and her staff
adhere to moral tenets of respect, fairness, caring, responsibility
and citizenship, "and the kids watch me like a hawk to make sure I
do."</TE>
<TE>   I think of my 10-year-old grandson, whose eyes glow with a
brightness not found in the faces of the lost children at Hollygrove.
I can only wish for them what he has -- a family, a home and goals. I
wish for them horizons.</TE>

<DH>Avant-garde auteur Jonas Mekas' long reverie on the early
years of his marriage finds exquisite beauty in the everyday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Manohla Dargis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I do not make films, I just film," says Jonas Mekas, somewhere
around the midway point of his four hour and 48 minute cinematic
reverie, "As I Was Moving Ahead Occasionally I Saw Brief Glimpses of
Beauty." One of the most important living avant-garde filmmakers in
America and one of the art's most tireless champions, Mekas, who
turns 80 later this month, has been shooting and splicing nonstop for
more than half a century. From the moment he bought a Bolex camera in
1950, filmmaking has not only been his passion, it has been his way
of living in the world.</LD>
<LD>   As with Mekas' greatest films -- diaries such as "Reminiscences of
a Journey to Lithuania" and "Lost, Lost, Lost" -- the new work is an
exaltation of the quotidian, about finding the divine in the
everyday. Shot in 16-millimeter, the film is composed of hand-held
images that rhythmically leap forward and backward in time, creating
a memory loop that continually takes us from the early 1970s (and
sometimes even earlier) through the 1980s and back again. Divided
into chapters and punctuated by an occasional typed title card, much
of the footage is devoted to the early years of Mekas' marriage, when
his two children were very young, but this is no mere home movie.
Rather, it is a vision of life as a domestic utopia and a bohemian
idyll -- joyous, generous, enviable, ecstatic.</LD>
<TE>   Hour after entrancing hour, we watch the Mekas family alone --
eating, reading, laughing, walking and playing -- as well as in the
embrace of close friends, accompanied by the filmmaker's intermittent
voice-over and snatches of music.</TE>
<TE>   Light flares periodically flood the pictures and every so often we
hear Mekas fumbling with the tape recorder, handmade touches that
underscore the deeply personal nature of the filmmaking. At one
point, Mekas turns the camera around to show us a young man feeding
brioche to a stray cat and, sometime later, the old man who's making
this film. Addressing us as "my dear friends" in the manner of a 19th
century novelist, he explains that he and his wife, Hollis, are the
film's protagonists, a clarification that becomes all the more
touching if you also know that they are now separated.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Lithuania, Mekas immigrated to the United States in 1949
with his filmmaker brother, Adolfas, after having spent time in a
Nazi labor camp. In 1955, he began publishing the influential
magazine Film Culture, in which you could read articles by critics
Pauline Kael, Andrew Sarris and Manny Farber (all in the same
issue!); three years later, he became the film critic for the Village
Voice.</TE>
<TE>   In between writing stints, he launched the Film-Makers
Cooperative, a nonprofit film rental library, and founded Anthology
Film Archives, arguably the most valuable screening venue in New York
City. Along the way, he also completed some two dozen intensely
personal, mostly nonnarrative films that, if he hadn't committed such
missionary zeal to the cause of avant-garde cinema, might have
brought him the artistic acclaim he deserves.</TE>
<TE>   Mekas has a genius for finding the right image -- one of the most
heartbreakingly beautiful is of his young daughter sitting next to a
vase of flowers, her head bobbing in sunshine close to the blooms --
but it's how the pictures flow together that gives the work its
power. A bowl of blueberries, a pear on a plate, a pink flower
against a green field, a child toddling toward the camera and a woman
smiling in bed are not only glimpses of beauty, they are the
fragments from which lives were built.</TE>
<TE>   However rapturous, memory is the ghost that haunts us all. For
Mekas, the ghosts will always be welcome because making images was
never an escape from the world but a way more deeply into it, even
now. "Nothing happens in this film," says the old man. Nothing -- and
everything.</TE>

<AU>Leah Ollman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Images like David Bailin's at Koplin Gallery are excellent reminders
of how apt a medium drawing is for negotiating the predicament of
existence. Drawing, as practiced so brilliantly here, is fluid,
immediate, raw, direct. It embodies a kind of contingency familiar
from lived experience. It can be forceful but forgiving. Marks can be
erased, but the memory lingers, giving drawings the quality -- much
like life itself -- of rough drafts perpetually in the making.</LD>
<LD>   Drawings can also of course be tightly controlled, polished
affairs. But Bailin opts for a restless, sketchy style. Working in
short charcoal strokes on prepared paper, Bailin draws scenes that
read like parables. In each, one person is shown, generally a
middle-aged everyman, somehow reckoning with his place in the world.
He is usually overdressed (in coat and tie) but seemingly
under-equipped, for the challenges he faces are daunting.</LD>
<LD>   In "Pickaxe," the man stands atop a huge boulder. This time he's
dressed for labor, in overalls, and work he does. His pick is raised
and about to come down on the rock. Bailin's variant on Sisyphean
fate has an ominous twist: If the man manages to break apart the
stone, he would succeed at his goal but, in the process, fall from
his solid perch. We play the witness, all too aware of the trouble to
come.</LD>
<TE>   Both "Water" and "Garden" are intriguing images of biblical
import. In the first, a man stands on the roof of his house, which
bobs like a cork in high water. The sole cloud in the sky sends rain
slashing down on him -- and only him. Is this modern-day Noah being
saved or punished? Issues of worthiness seem to plague him, just as
they did his ancient counterpart.</TE>
<TE>   In "Garden," Bailin restages Eden as a fenced-in oasis of
fertility within an unarticulated expanse of land beneath a
coffee-stained sky. In the center of the garden stands a ladder, upon
which the man has climbed. Shading his eyes with one hand, he surveys
the terrain beyond his appointed plot.</TE>
<TE>   As with the inhabitants of the original garden, this man seems a
captive of his own privilege. He cannot help but look beyond his
fence; it's human nature to question boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Bailin, who grew up in South Dakota (and now lives in Little Rock,
Ark.), brings his memory of the vast prairies to these drawings,
which feel epic in scope although the characters within them are
unheroic. They are ordinary men confronting the demands of the
moment, which mirror the perennial circumstances of humankind.</TE>
<TE>   They are trying to keep myriad forces in balance, forces earthly
and divine, imagined and inescapably real. Bailin's drawings are
remarkable chronicles of the effort.</TE>

<TE>   Pseudo-nature is hip but sterile</TE>
<TE>   We can't know nature except through culture, and if the culture of
the moment is technology driven, then it's not such a stretch to
envision organic systems in mechanical terms.</TE>
<TE>   In part, that's what Alyson Shotz does in her installations and
photographs at Lemon Sky. The works are visions of pseudo-nature,
products of the marriage between nature and artifice, the beautiful
and the abject. They're relentlessly hip, but only mildly engaging.</TE>
<TE>   "Indoor Gardening," as Shotz calls her two installations, sounds
like an oxymoron, but we have brought the outdoors in, not just to
the home but also to the lab. Shotz has constructed fragments of
generic interiors with vinyl flooring and fake wood paneling. The
look is domestic but sterile as a laboratory, the site of a bizarre
experiment.</TE>
<TE>   On the floors of her two mini-structures stand clusters of tall
bamboo-like stalks on wheels. The stalks are made of slim metal rods
and hose bibs, wrapped, painted and sheathed in a rubbery coating.
They're connected to one another -- and to the installation's
constructed walls as well as the gallery walls -- by tubing. Nearly
all the forms are a uniform pea-soup green.</TE>
<TE>   We've stepped into a suburban nightmare here, some kind of alien
visitation or sci-fi fantasy, at once absurd and terrible. The sheer
weirdness of it locks the gaze.</TE>
<TE>   Shotz's photographs subscribe to a more conventional beauty, but
they are born as well of mutation. Called "False Branches," they show
various plant forms grafted onto one another -- through the wonders
of digitization -- to create a thicket of stems, leaves, cactus
spines, lotus blossoms and mushroom caps. Glistening rods, like
branches after an ice storm, act as connectors, giving the network of
shapes the look of a complex molecular diagram.</TE>
<TE>   The eye jitters about, trying to impose some logic on these
mysterious skeins of live matter, but none holds. It's a brave new
world Shotz introduces to us, should we be brave enough to embrace
it.</TE>

<TE>   Debut show glimmers brightly</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Campbell's debut solo show at L.A. Louver Gallery delivers
as you'd hope an introduction would. The work has style and
substance, drama and promise. But the show falls short in ways that
also might be expected of a young, recent master's of fine arts grad.
It is inconsistent and a touch overblown.</TE>
<TE>   If the parts haven't altogether jelled, at least there's no
denying that the parts are there. Campbell can paint with
exhilarating panache, and she can penetrate to psychological depths.
The show glimmers brightly in spots, even if it doesn't shine
brilliantly throughout.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 paintings here refer largely to the artist's childhood:
riding in the family Cadillac, spying a brother or friend in the
upper branches of a tree, being held tenderly by a boy. The emotions
in some of them feel slight to the outside observer.</TE>
<TE>   Other scenes, though, carry potent charges, more accessible and
intriguing for their dark undercurrent. In "Sugar House," Campbell
gives us a grass-level view of a bee trapped in a glass jar. It's
familiar kids' play with a slightly foreboding edge.</TE>
<TE>   "Polish" shows a young girl raising a water glass over a spider as
if to catch it. The spider, however, appears to be a tarantula, too
large for the glass, hinging the scene on elements of uncertainty and
danger.</TE>
<TE>   In these two, as well as in "Discipline," a somewhat forced take
on sexual dynamics within the family home, both innocence and its
passage are right on the surface.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell's technical agility and psychological insight mesh most
effectively in "Hover," a stunning portrait rich in narrative
possibility but unburdened by historical particulars. The full figure
of a boy in jeans, perhaps a young teen, hovers in the center of this
9-foot-high canvas. He appears to have just jumped into a pool, and
he is suspended in that weightless, delicious disorientation between
downward momentum and the body's instinctual rise to the surface.</TE>
<TE>   The environment he floats in is a deep aqua, lush and limitless,
oxygenated by wild thrashings of white paint that skid and slide
across the surface. It's a magical moment, spectacularly realized.</TE>

<TE>   Aspiring to the photographic</TE>
<TE>   In the catalog for his current show at Roberts &amp; Tilton, Todd
Brainard is linked to a long, dusty line of Photo Realist painters.
His connection to photography, however, is just as strong though
coyly skewed.</TE>
<TE>   The trend of the day among color photographers (Andreas Gursky, et
al.) is to print huge, so that scale confers on the work the stature
and presence of paintings. Brainard makes large paintings that aspire
to the condition of photography. It makes for an interesting
conceptual circularity, but the paintings remain stubbornly dull.</TE>
<TE>   Brainard, based in Long Beach, paints forlorn snippets of
landscape, sometimes with oil pumps chugging in the background. In
each of the paintings here, he sets a fence or traffic sign right up
front and paints it with utter clarity, relegating the rest of the
scene to blur.</TE>
<TE>   The depth of field is extremely shallow, more like the product of
a fixed lens than a roving eye. Brainard compensates for the banality
of the image (just like those photographers do) by making it big and
intensely hued. Skies are souped-up jade and mauve. The fences,
railings and signs are teal, pungent yellow, cherry red.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever social commentary lies within these images remains
secondary to Brainard's fascination with the way vision works and how
paint can support or defy it.</TE>
<TE>   Illusion and visual convention are bandied about but not very
compellingly applied.</TE>

<HD>'Potter' words worth their weight in gold</HD>
<DH>A brief glimpse at the next book sells for about $45,180.
The proceeds go to charity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A private U.S. buyer coughed up $485 a word on Thursday for a 93-word
synopsis of the yet-to-be-completed fifth book about wizard boy
wonder Harry Potter.</LD>
<LD>   "It was sold to a telephone bidder from America for 28,680 pounds
[about $45,180]," said a spokesman for auction house Sotheby's. The
final price for the collection of random words giving a tantalizing
glimpse into the plot of "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"
was nearly five times the presale estimate.</LD>
<LD>   J.K.Rowling, the author of the world's most popular children's
books, offered the teaser for sale to raise funds for Book Aid
International. The charity supports book distribution in 40 of the
world's poorest countries.</LD>
<TE>   The actual content of the plot preview will remain the secret of
the buyer who bought it sight unseen -- although Sotheby's did
release a selection of the chosen words as a taster before the
auction. "Thirty-eight chapters ... might change ... longest volume
... Ron ... broom ... sacked ... house-elf ... new teacher ... dies
... sorry," were obviously more than enough to generate keen bidding
as Potter mania continues to sweep the globe.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of interest in this item," the Sotheby's
spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Errington, children's book expert at Sotheby's, told
Reuters before the sale that Rowling's contribution was unique: "It
is a very exciting item, and this type of thing does not come up very
often. The word 'die' certainly is a bit of a teaser."</TE>
<TE>   "Harry Potter" has sold 175 million copies in 59 languages, and
Rowling has been hailed by the publishing industry for teaching
children the joy of reading in an age of TV, cartoons and computer
games. Movies based on the first two Potter books have been worldwide
hits. The latest, "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," broke
the box-office record in Britain on its first weekend. That record
had been set last year by "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."</TE>
<TE>   Rowling produced the teaser for her next book at a Society of
Authors conference earlier this year when several writers were asked
to submit items for auction to help benefit Book Aid International.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful Christmas present for readers in some of the
world's poorest countries," said Sara Harrity, director of Book Aid
International.</TE>
<TE>   The money from the sale will be used to buy 18,500 books for
schools in Eritrea and elsewhere in Africa, Book Aid said.</TE>

<LD>Both sides claimed victory in the settlement of a copyright
infringement lawsuit over the authorship of "Sonny," Nicolas Cage's
directorial debut.</LD>
<LD>   In the suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles in
August, veteran TV writer Robert Dellinger ("Starsky and Hutch,"
"Kojak") claimed he had co-written the script -- and three others --
with John Carlen, the credited screenwriter, at a federal prison in
the 1970s. Carlen, incarcerated for bank robbery, had been taking a
creative writing workshop taught by Dellinger, who earlier had served
a sentence for extortion.</LD>
<LD>   Dellinger sued Intermedia Films, Gold Circle Films, Cage, and the
actor's production company, Saturn Films, asking for $2 million in
damages for failure to identify him as co-author. Although the amount
he received was not disclosed, the writer told Daily Variety that it
was "healthy."</LD>
<TE>   "Sonny," the story of a male prostitute who wants to mend his
ways, stars James Franco, Brenda Blethyn and Mena Suvari. The movie
will be released by Samuel Goldwyn Films on Dec. 27.</TE>

<LD>Word of two big movie sequels surfaced Thursday: Another "Rocky" and
"Indiana Jones" are in the works.</LD>
<LD>   MGM said it has signed Sylvester Stallone to write a "Rocky VI"
screenplay.</LD>
<LD>   Details were sketchy because Stallone, who wrote 1976's original
"Rocky," has just been hired. But early plans have Rocky Balboa
running a youth center when he is lured out of retirement for one
last time.</LD>
<TE>   Meantime, the syndicated TV show "Access Hollywood" reported that
Steven Spielberg had confirmed that a new "Indiana Jones" script is
written and ready to go before the cameras in 2004, with Harrison
Ford on board to star again as the adventurous archeologist.</TE>

<HD>Reindeer games with a fun edge</HD>
<DH>Two cool clay animation specials on CBS center on Robbie,
Rudolph's son.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You'll doubtless recall the most famous reindeer of all. But the most
happening one? That has to be his son, Robbie.</LD>
<LD>   It's not because Robbie is sophisticated or suave; in fact, he is
fairly dimwitted and clumsy. Yet as the star of "Robbie the Reindeer
in Hooves of Fire" and "Robbie the Reindeer in Legend of the Lost
Tribe," a pair of British imports tonight on CBS, he leads some of
the coolest holiday programs around.</LD>
<LD>   Quirkily funny and teeming with pop culture references, the
clay-animated programs don't follow the strait-laced style of such
classics as "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer," which precedes them at
8 p.m. Instead, their slightly skewed charm lies closer to that of
Tim Burton's "The Nightmare Before Christmas" -- and Aardman
Animations' "Wallace &amp; Gromit," which is no coincidence considering
that director Richard Goleszowski has an Aardman pedigree.</LD>
<TE>   "Hooves of Fire," the first "Robbie the Reindeer" installment,
originally aired in Britain in 1999 with an all-star British cast and
made its way to the Fox Family Channel a while back. Tonight's
version, however, has been revoiced with mostly American actors, but
with no diminution in star power.</TE>
<TE>   It opens with Robbie (Ben Stiller) landing at the North Pole, sent
there by his dad to build some character. The sleigh team welcomes
him, except for its longtime captain, Blitzen (Hugh Grant), who
resents Rudolph's fame. "Do children sing a song about me? No. Am I
on the magazines? No. Do I endorse carpet cleaner? No, no, no, no,"
Blitzen fumes, as he plots to crush Robbie.</TE>
<TE>   With the young buck facing elimination from the team, he realizes
the only way to regain the favor of Santa, a hipster nicknamed Weirdy
Beardy (Jim Belushi), is to win in the Reindeer Games. Potbellied
Robbie enlists the help of Donner (Britney Spears) and daft Old
Jingle (Jerry Stiller) to train.</TE>
<TE>   If the story seems somewhat predictable, it is -- because it's
riffing off films ranging from "Chariots of Fire" and "Star Wars" to
"Rocky" and "The Karate Kid." Just as delightful are allusions to
musical figures like Sgt. Pepper's and Seal.</TE>
<TE>   The same elements combine equally well in the new sequel, "Legend
of the Lost Tribe." It pits Blitzen against his fellow reindeer in a
diabolical scheme to build an amusement park, and Robbie leads the
charge against him with the help of a band of Vikings, all named
Magnus (and voiced by James Woods).</TE>
<TE>   In both programs, many of the jokes work on separate adult and kid
levels. Somewhat surprising for TV-G-rated fare, there are a few
liberties taken in the language department. Strangest of all, Donner
and the sexpot Vixen (Leah Remini), the two female reindeer, have
breasts -- as if their long eyelashes and voices weren't making their
femininity clear enough.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly prudish parents may want to shield their kids from
this stuff -- and secretly tape it for themselves to watch later on.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the air</TE>
<TE>   "Robbie the Reindeer in Hooves of Fire" airs at 9 tonight on CBS,
followed at 9:30 by "Robbie the Reindeer in Legend of the Lost
Tribe." The network has rated both shows TV-G (suitable for all
ages).</TE>

<HD>Wistfulness and humor in aging</HD>
<DH>In 'Morning's at Seven,' at the Ahmanson, a talented
ensemble cast brings to life timeless midlife questions of
fulfillment and regret.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Shirley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prediction: Plays about people in their 60s and 70s are about to
become more popular, as baby boomers approach their 60s.</LD>
<LD>   "Morning's at Seven" will certainly encourage this trend. Although
its setting, a small Midwestern town in 1938, may seem remote, Paul
Osborn's beguiling 1939 comedy is ideally constructed for baby
boomers' concerns.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, most of the characters -- despite their particular ages
-- are facing what are now referred to as midlife crises, in which
long-held assumptions are suddenly challenged by the ticking clock.
However, none of them has yet to encounter the physical indignities
of extreme old age. So boomers can look at them and glimpse a bit of
themselves while preserving the reassuring feeling that these
somewhat older people are not yet at the end of their rope.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, the gifted cast at the Ahmanson Theatre looks as spry as
the play itself, despite the characters' agonizing little quandaries.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the four sisters at the heart of the play live in two
houses that are next door to each other -- only a few feet apart on
John Lee Beatty's handsome Norman Rockwellian set -- while the fourth
lives a few blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   Although these families aren't rich, there is no indication that
any of the sisters ever held a job outside the home or that financial
considerations ever seemed pressing. The Depression seems very
distant.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the four sisters are housewives. The only one who didn't
marry, Aaronetta (Elizabeth Franz), is regarded as an old maid and a
hanger-on by her sister Cora (Mary Louise Wilson), with whom she has
lived all these decades.</TE>
<TE>   But Cora's husband Thor (William Biff McGuire) is more tolerant.
Next door, the third sister Ida (Frances Sternhagen) is coping with
her husband Carl (Paul Dooley), who appears to be having a nervous
breakdown as he ponders what else he might have done with his life.
He keeps referring to "the fork" where he apparently made a wrong
turn.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, on the day when the play opens, Ida's and Carl's
40-year-old son Homer (Stephen Tobolowsky) is finally bringing home
his fiancee Myrtle (Julie Hagerty), who lives in a nearby town, so
she can meet his folks, aunts and uncles. They've been engaged for
seven years, but mama's-boy Homer is reluctant to leave Ida,
especially when his father is acting so strangely.</TE>
<TE>   A few blocks away, the fourth sister Esther (Piper Laurie) is in a
skirmish with her prickly spouse David (Buck Henry). He regards
Esther's relations as "morons," with the possible exception of Carl.
David has decreed that any visit by Esther to her sisters is grounds
for separation -- within the same house, that is. David will live on
the first floor while Esther inhabits the second.</TE>
<TE>   This is a Lincoln Center production that earned nine Tony
nominations earlier this year. Director Daniel Sullivan regrouped
most of his stellar cast, and they work together with a cohesion that
reflects months of togetherness.</TE>
<TE>   Although it's difficult to pick stars out of such an ensemble, the
showiest sister role is Franz's rancorous Aaronetta. Last seen on
this stage as Linda Loman in "Death of a Salesman," Franz creates a
snarling little woman whose attempts to stake out her own claim to
happiness seem alternately poignant and poisonous. Franz is also
blessed with the funniest moment in the play, a third-act climax that
is an irresistible tribute to Osborn's craftsmanship, even as it
deprives the play of some thematic weight.</TE>
<TE>   The newcomer to the cast's sister quartet is Wilson as Cora,
locked in combat with Aaronetta. Wilson adeptly crinkles her features
to furnish a more subtle variation on some of the same emotions
evoked by Franz, yet she also unleashes a surprisingly horsy yet
winning laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Sternhagen has Ida's fluttery demeanor well in hand, while
Laurie's Esther is her rock-solid opposite. The prints on the women's
dresses, designed by Jane Greenwood, have enough color to mitigate
the dowdiness of the style.</TE>
<TE>   The younger couple provides adroit comedy throughout. Tobolowsky,
who directed a revival of this play for Theatre 40 in 1999, has the
mannerisms of a younger, geekier Al Gore, while Hagerty's patented
girlish voice is ideal for a stiff exchange of small talk with her
mother-in-law that is almost reminiscent of the dialogues in "The
Bald Soprano."</TE>
<TE>   Among the older men, McGuire's Thor retains an amusingly dry
perspective, while Dooley's Carl is equally funny as he is swept away
by his visions of the road not taken. But Henry doesn't have the
vocal power that might make David's disdain truly biting.</TE>
<TE>   The title of the play was taken from Robert Browning's poem that
includes the sentiment "All's right with the world," and it was
surely intended to be somewhat ironic. Still, you would never know
from this play that a world war was waiting in the wings. The world
here seems to be doing well enough, allowing for a lot of foolishness
from human beings along the way.</TE>

<HD>Varla Jean gives it her all</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The holidays can be hard on anyone, but they're especially trying for
Varla Jean Merman, the genetically unfortunate chanteuse who claims
to be the love child of Ethel Merman and Ernest Borgnine.</LD>
<LD>   A devotee of show business practices several decades past, Varla
Jean (otherwise known as Jeffery Roberson) believes that a performer
hasn't made it until she has appeared in her own Christmas television
special. Tired of waiting for the industry to notice her, she pushes
ahead, as best she can, with "Varla Jean Merman's Holiday Ham!" That
she must settle for the stage -- the Renberg Theatre at the L.A. Gay
&amp; Lesbian Center -- instead of network television is but one in a
lifetime of disappointments.</LD>
<LD>   Crowned with a mountain of auburn hair and packed into sequined
gowns, the tall, solidly built Roberson is at once ungainly and
surprisingly sleek as he struts and shimmies in his best imitation of
a '60s-era vixen. When singing, he approximates a remarkably
crystalline soprano, a talent that -- as proved in previous local
engagements -- sets him apart from his drag brethren.</LD>
<TE>   Varla Jean tries to make an elegant entrance while singing "Ave
Maria," but things nearly turn tragic when she finds herself juggling
three candles that are dripping hot wax onto her fingers. Deftly
directed by Michael Schiralli, the rest of the show delivers such
daffy delights as a deliciously Streisand-esque version of "Jingle
Bells," a wacky medley of "Carol of the Bells" and the disco anthem
"Ring My Bell" (complete with hand bells), and a surprise appearance
by Varla Jean's beloved Ann-Margret (Maggie Moore, doing a wicked
impersonation).</TE>
<TE>   Varla Jean gives her all, despite the continual heckling of her
piano player, the priceless Ricky Ritzel. Yet time and again, the
message of the season -- family, babies -- dredges up painful
memories. Varla Jean gets a bit weepy when this happens, but she's a
survivor. And that just makes her all the more fabulous.</TE>

<TE>   Letters detail family drama</TE>
<TE>   With the Internet steadily debasing the written word, there is a
courageous quality to "Transports of the Heart: Letters Through the
Ages" at Write Act Repertory Company in Hollywood. Clyde Derrick and
Gene Franklin Smith's readers' theater piece celebrates the supremacy
of epistolary communication and the eternal pull of family ties.</TE>
<TE>   Meg Kruszewska's clean staging puts content front and center, with
the imaginatively juxtaposed selections taking in historic figures
spanning the centuries. From Abelard's Heloise to Galileo, Thomas
Jefferson to Amelia Earhart, their excerpted writings create a
consistently intriguing collage of social issues viewed through a
personal filter.</TE>
<TE>   The Marquess of Queensbury's denunciation of Oscar Wilde abuts
modern-day gay American John Johnson's wistful plea for paternal
tolerance. Calamity Jane whoops it up in a letter to her daughter,
while Groucho Marx takes hilarious shots at the brothers Warner. The
conjoined letters of Marie Antoinette, Ethel Rosenberg and AIDS
activist Mary Fisher to their children form a wrenching fugue, and so
it goes.</TE>
<TE>   The tech is spare and effective, notably Bob Decew's lighting. The
versatile ensemble consists of Graham Barnard, Lisa Cassandra, Wendy
Gough, Ben Livingston, Scott O'Connor, Maggie Peach, Steve Peterson,
Pamela Salem and Karen Marie Seigel, all of them wonderful.</TE>
<TE>   True, such small-scaled, specialized theater seems ultimately
suited to the academic circuit, a natural for Los Angeles school
district audiences. Nonetheless, "Transports" is keenly
thought-provoking and genuinely educational, which easily recommends
it.</TE>

<TE>   'Genius' falls short of humor, logic</TE>
<TE>   Whatever hopes and expectations might be fueled in anticipation of
a play titled "The Genius," the hard reality at the Bitter Truth
Playhouse falls far short of them.</TE>
<TE>   Mitch Giannunzio's romantic comedy strains for laughs in reworking
the artist-fakes-own-death-to-increase-value-of-work caper -- a
scenario that hasn't gained much traction since that screwball 1965
Dick Van Dyke vehicle "The Art of Love."</TE>
<TE>   This tamer three-character descendant blunts even the edge of
deliberate roguery, revolving instead around a misunderstanding that
could easily be cleared up at any point but isn't for no apparent
reason other than that, if it were, there would be no story left.
There's an intriguing epistemological tautology wrapped somewhere
around that narrative axle, but it would take a real genius to
unravel it, and there's none to be found anywhere on this stage.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, we're left with the more mundane conundrums facing a
weak-willed aspiring writer named Gerald (Matthew Godfrey) and his
dotty Aunt Dottie (Jill Basey), a late-blooming amateur painter whose
raw brilliance is to be accepted as a given.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking a professional sales channel for Dottie's work, Gerald
turns to his old unrequited school heartthrob, Sara (Emilie Davezac),
now divorced and the owner of a hip new gallery. After declaring her
discriminating disdain for new painters, Sara is naturally smitten
with Dottie's work and promptly lapses into a marketing reverie
predicated on the artist being deceased.</TE>
<TE>   In hopes of kindling a romance, Gerald can't bring himself to
correct Sara's mistaken impression, which leads to the predictable
scandal and legal repercussions when a drunken Dottie reveals the
truth at her posthumous high-profile opening.</TE>
<TE>   In scenes bouncing between a split set of Dottie's rural cabin and
Sara's gallery, improbabilities mount at every turn. Lapses in
internal logic are glaring, but it's the absence of a reason to root
for any of these characters that proves the truly insurmountable
hurdle facing director Joen Nielsen Lewis. Dottie is cantankerous
without charm, and Gerald is too spineless to earn our interest, much
less Sara's love. While Sara is a self-absorbed prancing pony,
Davezac's accomplished comic timing offers the one bright spot in an
otherwise undistinguished effort.</TE>

<TE>   Modern-day nativity scene</TE>
<TE>   The sight of a homeless, modern-day Joseph pushing a pregnant Mary
through the streets in a shopping cart is but one of many vivid
images in Grupo de Teatro Sinergia's "Pastorela."</TE>
<TE>   Devised by director Ruben Amavizca and his actors, this reworking
of a traditional Christmas pastorela unfolds in an urban park very
much like MacArthur Park, just a couple of blocks from where
alternating Spanish- and English-language versions of the show are
being presented in the Unity Arts Center's Frida Kahlo Theater. The
setting becomes a potent symbol of Los Angeles -- a place where
people from many walks of life brush shoulders yet never really
notice one another until a miracle brings them together.</TE>
<TE>   A centuries-old tradition, the pastorela, or shepherd's play, is
told from the viewpoint of the flock watchers, who, on their way to
visit the newborn Jesus, are waylaid by devils who want to prevent
such adoration. Typically, each community peppers its version with
local references and commentary.</TE>
<TE>   Here Jose (Sergio Lennell Guido) searches for a place for Maria
(April Ibarra, alternating with Juanita Devis) to give birth, while a
prostitute (Marina Dena-Santo) wrestles with her conscience as she
prepares to abandon her daughter (the incandescent Jeanine
Monterroza) in hopes that the youngster will find a fuller life with
someone else. Amid references to immigration searches, fake green
cards and confiscation of unlicensed vendors' wares, these
disadvantaged families receive assistance from a poor flower seller
(Teresita Cuadrado), a voluptuous store clerk (Jacqueline
Caldero-Guido), a cow escaped from a transport truck (Arely-Lorena
Araniva) and an angelic gardener (Pete Leal).</TE>
<TE>   The devil disguises himself as an officer of the law (a swaggering
Edwin Rivera Corcios) and gains a follower when a meddlesome Asian
store owner (Laura Vega) begins to rat on her neighbors. Though
presented comically, these characterizations can be painful to watch.
Consciously or not, they indicate how far Los Angeles must progress
before it can achieve true unity.</TE>
<TE>   Much of this will fly over younger children's heads, as will the
handful of bawdy bits. Still, "Pastorela" could prove enlightening
for many kids, and they'll get to swing at a pinata at show's end.</TE>

<TE>   Equal time for male private parts</TE>
<TE>   Not so long ago, public discussion of one's private parts was
frowned upon by polite society. Now, people can't seem to hear
enough, as "The Vagina Monologues" phenomenon continues to grow and
the two-month run of a copycat piece, "The Penis Monologues," has
been extended.</TE>
<TE>   The discussion sparked by Eve Ensler's "Vagina Monologues" has
been healthy, and Willard Manus contributes some intriguing -- if not
exactly earth-shattering -- observations about men and their
reproductive organs in his new play.</TE>
<TE>   The show is playing through Saturday at the Jewel Box Theatre
Center in Hollywood and will move in January to the Odyssey Theatre
in West Los Angeles. Whereas Ensler based her show on interviews with
200 women, Manus has meshed his own writing with excerpts from works
by Philip Roth, Charles Bukowski, John Rechy, Hubert Selby Jr., Pedro
Juan Gutierrez and others.</TE>
<TE>   The compilation benefits enormously from a crisp
concert-reading-style staging by Louis Fantasia and playful
performances by John Aniston (father of Jennifer and known to soap
lovers as Victor Kiriakis on "Days of Our Lives"), John DiFusco (key
creator of the Vietnam War drama "Tracers") and Leon Morenzie (so
powerful earlier this year in International City Theatre's " 'Master
Harold' ... and the boys").</TE>
<TE>   Seated at music stands and reading from scripts in what looks
vaguely like a rec room, the actors share their insecurities about
size, contemplate whether men really think with their crotches,
consider the fears -- founded and unfounded -- that their loins have
inspired, weigh the pros and cons of condoms and circumcision, and so
on.</TE>
<TE>   Some segments directly copy "The Vagina Monologues" -- e.g., "If
your penis got dressed, what would it wear?" -- but most strike off
in new directions.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most powerful moments: DiFusco's howl of pain as he
reads from the Ron Kovic memoir "Born on the Fourth of July,"
describing the high price that one paralyzed soldier paid for his
country.</TE>

<HD>A new enterprise as 'Trek' lives long, prospers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With all the recent fuss over the longevity of the James Bond
franchise, the folks over at "Star Trek" must be feeling like
intergalactic chopped liver.</LD>
<LD>   Has everyone forgotten that since starting out in 1966, the
Trekkers have turned out four TV series with hundreds and hundreds of
episodes, not to mention 10 motion pictures, all complete with sharp
uniforms, menacing aliens and bracing commands from the bridge? Does
all this fade into insignificance at the sight of Halle Berry in an
orange bikini?</LD>
<LD>   Ever resilient and reliable, the Starship Enterprise team has
never hesitated to move forward no matter what the obstacles, and the
latest feature, "Star Trek Nemesis," has once again ventured into
unexplored territory. Both a writer ("Gladiator's" John Logan) and a
director (Stuart Baird of "U.S. Marshals") new to the franchise have
signed on for the latest voyage and ushered in a spanking new group
of outer space outlaws.</LD>
<TE>   These would be the dreadful Remans, as creepy in a vampire-like,
"Nosferatu"-influenced way as you'd expect folks who live on the dark
side of their planet to be. But it's their leader, Shinzon (Tom
Hardy), who is most unnerving and whose back story gives this film
the most insinuating villain since Alice Krige's Queen of the Borg
stopped hearts across the galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Remans are confronted, the Starship crew, led as always
by Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), pauses for some happy
moments. The captain's right-hand man, Cmdr. William Riker (Jonathan
Frakes) is marrying half-human, half-Betazoid Cmdr. Deanna Troi
(Marina Sirtis) in a wedding highlighted by a chorus of Irving
Berlin's "Blue Skies" sung by emotionless android Data (Brent Spiner)
and Whoopi Goldberg, in an uncredited appearance as Guinan.On the way
to Betazed for further celebrations, the crew stops at the planet
Kolarus III, where they discover a dismantled look-alike earlier
version of Data called B-4 (get it?). "This doesn't feel right," the
captain says, and who should know better than he?</TE>
<TE>   Given that they are already close to the Romulan neutral zone, the
Enterprise is next sent on a diplomatic mission to that hostile
planet, which, in a massive break with precedent, has a new ruler who
comes from the usually subservient sister planet of Remus. And what a
ruler he turns out to be.</TE>
<TE>   For unlike his creepy Viceroy (an unrecognizable Ron Perlman) and
the other Remans, Shinzon is a human, albeit a human who has seen so
few of his kind that he reacts like a sailor at a strip club when he
notices the lovely Commander Troi, adding one of several unexpected
notes of sexual urgency to the proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Played with an unsettling youthful hauteur by British actor Hardy
(previously seen in "Band of Brothers" and "Black Hawk Down"),
Shinzon has a noticeable resemblance to, yes, Capt. Picard. Is it the
bald head, the jaunty nose, the air of steely resolve? As someone
asks in a typical "Star Trek" moment, "What is this all about?"</TE>
<TE>   Hey, it's about the old-fashioned kind of thematic science fiction
that isn't seen much anymore, redolent of late-night dorm-room chat
sessions on issues like doubles and the nature of identity, when
questions on the order of "can the echo defeat the voice" could seem,
after too much caffeine abuse, like something almost profound.
Questions that helped make the original Gene Roddenberry "Star Trek"
such a phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   It's true that the "Star Trek" movies, and "Nemesis" is only
partially an exception, have an air of pokey earnestness about them.
No one is going to say they have the narrative propulsion of a
runaway train, no matter who writes and directs them. And, with
Stewart and in this case Hardy very much the exceptions, no one is
going to say they are memorably acted. Familiarity and continuity are
what the success of this series has always been about. We've been
here before, and we like the neighborhood.</TE>

<HD>'The Guys' makes a powerful transition from the stage</HD>
<DH>Anthony LaPaglia and Sigourney Weaver are superb in this
moving adaptation of the post-Sept. 11 play.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Dec. 4, 2001, Manhattan's Flea Theater began a series of workshop
performances of "The Guys," a play by Anne Nelson written in response
to Sept. 11 and commissioned by the Flea's founder, Jim Simpson.
Nelson and Simpson have now brought the play to the screen with an
understated power and with Sigourney Weaver (Simpson's wife) and
Anthony LaPaglia in roles they first played on stage. Essentially a
two-character drama, "The Guys" makes the transition from stage to
screen with considerable grace apart from some awkwardly inserted but
brief archival footage.</LD>
<LD>   "The Guys" is set 10 days after Sept. 11, and chance has brought
together Weaver's Joan, an elegant, poised freelance journalist who
has a rewarding professional and personal life, and lives with her
husband and children in a tasteful Upper West Side apartment.
LaPaglia's Nick is the veteran captain of a ladder company faced with
having to speak at eight memorial services for men he has lost on
Sept. 11, with many more speeches sure to follow. Numb with shock and
grief, he is at a loss for words when he and Joan have been brought
together in the Park Slope, Brooklyn, home of his neighbor, Joan's
younger sister.</LD>
<TE>   Craving an opportunity to respond to Sept. 11, Joan commences with
forthrightness and sensitivity in drawing out Nick, a warm,
blue-collar man who is determined not to give way to tears that
continually threaten to well up in his eyes. These are two
intelligent, mature adults who love their work and waste no time in
tackling the task at hand. In getting Nick to start telling her about
his lost comrades despite the acute pain he experiences in doing so,
she finds descriptions and revelations she can then weave into
coherent eulogies.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson, director of the international program at the Columbia
University School of Journalism, had never written a play before, but
she clearly drew upon what she had experienced and thought about in
regard to Sept. 11. Weaver has the authority and sensitivity to play
a first-rate journalist, and thanks to Nelson, Joan is a uniquely
convincing character. Her knack of giving shape and punch to Nick's
words and emotions without distorting them is indeed enviable.</TE>
<TE>   Joan's authenticity in turn reinforces Nick's realness. Weaver and
LaPaglia quietly, effortlessly soar, and through their Joan and Nick
we can experience the overwhelming enormity of Sept. 11 in an acutely
personal way free of horrifying twin towers images, flag-waving and
war-on-terrorism hysteria. What Nick imparts to Joan is the
tremendous value his lost men possessed as human beings going about
their dangerous jobs with dedication and without fuss.</TE>
<TE>   "The Guys" becomes a hugely moving tribute not only to New York's
brave firefighters, but also to all the people who go about their
daily lives contributing to the collective good that we never seem to
know about until, with cruel irony, tragedy strikes. In "The Guys' "
best line, Joan observes that she and Nick weren't supposed to know
each other, but that they do meet and can help and console each other
gives a most heartening dimension to a most somber film.</TE>

<HD>'Talk' raises eyebrows while opening minds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seeing "Talk to Her," the highly touted new film from Spanish
writer-director Pedro Almodovar, is like taking a drug everyone says
is dynamite and impatiently wondering why the heck it's not kicking
in. The kick in fact turns out to be real, and as powerful as
advertised, but it doesn't necessarily hit you in any way you
anticipated.</LD>
<LD>   For at its core, in both its technique and what it has to say,
"Talk to Her" is very much a subversive film, one that takes its time
creeping in under your skin. But once there, it's determined to stay
awhile, to entice the mind into playing seditious games. This story
of women in comas and the men who love them aims to both discomfort
us and enlarge our horizons, to take us to the far shores of human
emotion and make them look like the beaches at home.</LD>
<LD>   In some ways, this is not completely unexpected. Almodovar, with
films like "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown," "Tie Me Up!
Tie Me Down!" and 1999's Oscar-winning "All About My Mother," has
always relished his reputation as world cinema's iconic bad boy,
fearlessly rushing in where soberer minds would hesitate to venture.
But the filmmaker has passed 50 now, and as he told The Times, "I
need to explore new things. I'm saturated with the Almodovar of 10
years ago."</LD>
<TE>   In essence, "Talk to Her" is the kind of picture you'd expect
Almodovar to make if he made a serious picture. The film relishes the
contrivances of melodrama but it has a fearless confidence in its
ability to make them meaningful. Its got its taboo-shaking moments,
including a mock silent film called "Shrinking Lover" that manages to
be slightly sensational as well as completely innocent, but its
concerns have broadened beyond the transient pleasures of shocking
the bourgeoise.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, what "Talk to Her" does is insist in its very
particular way on the importance of emotion, connection and love, no
matter how obsessive a form they may take. In line with the Roman
writer Terence's famous belief that "nothing human is alien to me,"
it views deeply disturbed, even deviant behavior from an almost
unimaginably empathetic space. And it does so in a way that is more
thoughtful and genuinely reflective than we've had from this
filmmaker before.</TE>
<TE>   "Talk to Her' is book-ended by a pair of modern dance performances
featuring Germany's iconic Pina Bausch Tanztheater. The first, "Cafe
Muller," is witnessed by two men, strangers, who happen to be seated
next to each other in the theater. One of them, Benigno (Javier
Camara), is very touched when he notices that his seatmate, who we
eventually find out is Marco (Dario Grandinetti), is moved to tears
by the performance.</TE>
<TE>   We know what went through Benigno's mind because he talks about it
the next day to a young woman named Alicia (Leonor Watling) while
doing her nails, giving her a sponge bath and in general lavishing
the kind of almost religious devotion to her body that seems more
appropriate for dressing the corpse of a saint.</TE>
<TE>   Alicia is neither a saint nor a corpse. She is a beautiful dancer
who's been in a deep coma, something called a persistent vegetative
state, for four years. Benigno -- pudgy, officious, but somehow
genuine -- is her devoted nurse, his actions characterized by a
virtuous willingness to work long hours at her side and an unshakable
belief that Alicia hears all his talk even if she appears to be dead
to the world.</TE>
<TE>   Lydia (Rosario Flores) is by contrast the most active of women, a
bullfighter who is recovering from a tumultuous love affair with a
fellow torero. Benigno's erstwhile seatmate Marco, who turns out to
be a journalist with an interest in desperate women, decides to do a
story on her and a romantic relationship soon develops.</TE>
<TE>   By one of those coincidences Almodovar's films couldn't exist
without, Lydia is not only soon in a coma identical to Alicia's but
also ends up hospitalized in the same facility. Benigno recognizes
Marco at once, and the two very different, very lonely men soon
become close friends, bonded by a need to communicate to someone.</TE>
<TE>   Though it may sound as if a lot has happened by this point in the
narrative (including a moving solo performance by Brazilian Caetano
Veloso that is included at least partly because Almodovar is a big
fan), it is here that "Talk to Her" is just getting started.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, the compelling back stories of both the Benigno-Alicia
and the Marco-Lydia relationships are revealed, and a remarkable
twist occurs that puts everything in a different perspective. The
compassionate message of finding humanity in the outcast, a message
that, given the persecution he endured as a young gay man in Franco's
Spain, must resonate strongly with Almodovar, is presented in an
especially provocative way.</TE>
<TE>   The director, as usual, has an exact eye for casting. His woman
are memorable even while in a coma, a state Almodovar reminds us in
the press notes, is far from easy to play. And Camara in the
extremely delicate role of Benigno is more effective than one would
have thought possible. "I fear," the director writes, "that for a
long time Benigno will accompany Jamier Camara as his shadow." It's
an accurate judgment, and one that applies as well to this singular
work and the filmmaker who called it forth from the most personal
part of his soul.</TE>

<HD>'Greetings From Tucson' takes a holiday detour with Los
Lobos</HD>
<DH>The band behind the show's soundtrack joins the on-screen
action as the sitcom's family toys with its neighbors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Sandell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Have Los Lobos become just another band from East ... Tucson? Well,
not exactly, but for the purposes of tonight's episode of "Greetings
From Tucson" at 9:30 on the WB, it is.</LD>
<LD>   The group -- whose projects have ranged from its 1978 debut album
of Mexican folk music, "Just Another Band From East L.A.," to a hit
single remake of Ritchie Valens' "La Bamba" -- has provided the
soundtrack for the series since its premiere in September.</LD>
<LD>   But tonight it goes in front of the camera, in the role of "needy
band looking for a garage in which to practice on Christmas Eve."</LD>
<TE>   Little do the members know how needy they are, for they have been
led into the household of Joaquin Tiant (Julio Oscar Mechoso), who's
suffering from a serious case of short-man's syndrome and the
bah-humbug blues. Before long, he's calling them "los losers" and
teaching them the finer points of Marvin Gaye's "What's Going On."</TE>
<TE>   But that's not all Joaquin is contending with. There are the
annoying carolers; his 15-year-old son, David (Pablo Santos), who
wants to go on a ski trip with the girl next door, Sarah (Sara
Paxton); and Sarah's horridly clueless white-bread parents.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, much of this holiday episode revolves around the
hoodwinking of those parents into thinking there is a "Mexican
Christmas" with all manner of strange customs. Joaquin's daughter,
Maria (Aimee Garcia), talks of the "Christmas bandit" who shoots
jumping beans from pistols. Joaquin's Irish American wife, Elizabeth
(Rebecca Creskoff), dryly asserts that she's "converted" and tells of
Senor Muerte, not Santa, delivering gifts from his donkey cart.</TE>
<TE>   In some respects, this episode can be a bit one-note and not much
different from your standard holiday sitcom fare.</TE>
<TE>   But it is refreshing to see something that's long been missing
from prime time: the portrayal of a middle-class Mexican American
family.</TE>
<TE>   And if all else fails, there are a few minutes of Los Lobos'
tuneful work.</TE>

<HD>Guitarists, composers finally compare notes</HD>
<DH>USC's Thornton School pools talents at Skirball Cultural
Center show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josef Woodard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Because USC's Thornton School of Music has long been fertile ground
for both classical guitar and compositional interests, a concert in
which "Thornton Guitarists Meet Thornton Composers" makes good sense,
a natural blend of available resources. Tuesday's program was the
first of a few collaborations between the Thornton School and the
Skirball Cultural Center, and it proved rich in both concept and
execution.</LD>
<LD>   Players included faculty members James Smith and Brian Head, as
well as such alumni as Scott Tennant and William Kanengiser, who have
gone on to fame in the Los Angeles Guitar Quartet and on their own.
All guitarists involved winningly performed music of Head (the
jazz-hued, slightly dissonant lark of "Brookland Boogie," for
example), Donald Crockett (including the intriguing, varied
miniatures of "Falcon's Eye"), James Hopkins and the late Robert Linn
(his "Forward, Inward, and Afterward" is a bold and bittersweet
guitar duet deserving wide attention).</LD>
<TE>   The concert's centerpiece was only partially concerned with
guitar, per se. Imaginative and crafty composer Stephen Hartke
presented both the short, eloquently murmuring solo guitar piece "Un
tout petit trompe-l'oreille" and the evening's largest work, the odd,
moving and witty 1996 chamber piece "Sons of Noah: Lost Chapters from
the Bible." Scored for the strange, and strangely effective,
instrumentation of three quartets -- guitars, bassoons, and flutes
(doubling on piccolos) -- the piece involves cooperative sonic
factions, often snugly tethered to pulse-driven rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   The text, by Philip Littell, is a satirical treatise on post-Noah
land greed, avidly sung here by soprano Lisa Stidham. It also
benefits from a cryptic solemnity and also topicality, in an age of
topographical malaise.</TE>

<DH>The story so far: Sarah has told her family she has to help
Chelsea with a school report on the Amish. But she is going to watch
TV with Chelsea and her family instead.</DH>

<LD>In the Hewlitts' living room I sat on the sofa near Chelsea. Her
brothers, Drew and Marc, sprawled on the floor, and her baby sister,
Tiffani, crawled around.</LD>
<LD>   Looking at the TV screen, I realized Chelsea had been right. It
was like a book, but the pictures moved. The noise was awful, though.</LD>
<LD>   The program was about baby tigers, and seeing them jump and play
was wonderful. Next, something called "cartoons" came on. There were
lots of jerky movements, and they were even louder. I was getting a
headache.</LD>
<TE>   After that, it was something they said was a "rerun," with more
yelling. The Hewlitts laughed at everything. Then Drew picked up a
black rectangular thing and pushed some buttons. The picture changed.</TE>
<TE>   "Leave it there," Chelsea screamed. "I want to watch this movie."</TE>
<TE>   "No way!" Drew screamed back. "We're watching 'Alien Man.' "</TE>
<TE>   "What about 'Video Capers'?" Marc yelled. He began fighting with
Drew. Tiffani was crying.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey!" Mr. Hewlitt's voice boomed, and he grabbed the black
rectangle. "I'm turning to the baseball game, and that's it." Now
they all were screaming, and Tiffani kept crying.</TE>
<TE>   My head felt like a giant balloon, and my stomach hurt. Nobody
noticed when I went outside. Lying on the cool grass was the first
ordinary thing I'd done all day.</TE>
<TE>   So I'd seen TV, I thought to myself. It was fun, I supposed, but
it was far too loud. And the fighting! TV wasn't worth that much
fuss. I felt guilty too that I'd made up the story about Chelsea's
report. I buried my head in the blades of grass.</TE>
<TE>   Then, from a distance, I heard the familiar clip-clop of our horse
and buggy, and I was sure of one thing. For me, plain and simple is
the way it is and the way it always will be.</TE>

<HD>Activists Decry 'Happy Cows' Ads</HD>
<DH>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals plans to go to
court to seek a ban on commercials the group calls misleading.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Sherman</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Animal rights activists who complain that California dairy cows do
not live the happy life shown in a popular television advertising
campaign for the state's cheese producers say they are heading to
court to try to force the ads off the air.</LD>
<LD>   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and author John
Robbins of Santa Cruz, using California's strong consumer protection
laws, said Wednesday that they planned to ask a San Francisco
Superior Court judge to ban the "happy cows" ads. The activists say
the ads are false, unfairly favor California cheese over other
states' cheeses and mislead consumers about environmental damage from
the dairy industry.</LD>
<LD>   The ads, which feature cows that talk, show cows in green pastures
and contend that "great cheese comes from happy cows." Happy cows,
the ads say, come from California.</LD>
<TE>   In a recent commercial, a high-strung chicken pesters two
impassive cows for the secret of their tranquillity. Finally, the
chicken says, "Silence. OK, like a Zen thing. I get it, Grasshopper."</TE>
<TE>   After the chicken moves on, one cow says, "Wow." The other chimes
in, "Yeah, poultry."</TE>
<TE>   The California Milk Advisory Board, which produces the ads,
credits the commercials with helping the state close in on Wisconsin,
the country's lead- ing cheese producer. California farmers produced
1.6 billion pounds of cheese in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Where the ads are seen, it creates more demand," said Nancy
Fletcher, the milk advisory board's spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   But PETA says most California dairy cows live not in bucolic
pastures but in filthy, grassless lots where they are forced to give
too much milk and are separated from their calves too soon.</TE>
<TE>   "Increasing numbers of the public do want to know how the food
they eat is produced," said Robbins, son of a co-founder of ice cream
maker Baskin- Robbins.</TE>
<TE>   Robbins is a vegetarian, and PETA advocates a dairy-free diet. But
Robbins says the issue is about informing consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "This ad campaign is such an affront to people who want to make an
informed choice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint says, "Contrary to the depictions in the Happy Cows
ads, the vast majority of California dairy cows do not live easy
lives."</TE>
<TE>   In October, the Federal Trade Commission declined to take action
on a similar complaint from PETA.</TE>
<TE>   Fletcher of the milk advisory board said the group, having lost at
the FTC, is simply shopping for anyone to take a look at the
complaint, which she described as groundless.</TE>
<TE>   "The better our farmers take care of cows, the more productive
they are," she said. "It's in the best interest of dairy farmers to
take care of their cows."</TE>
<TE>   The cheese producers' Web site sells Happy Cows plush toys and
T-shirts that say, "So much grass, so little time."</TE>
<TE>   The site also offers testimonials from happy consumers. Bob of
Exeter, Calif., wrote: "Please do not let whoever is complaining
about the commercials stop you from doing them. My family now looks
for the real California cheese label because of the commercials."</TE>
<TE>   Robbins, who grew up in a Southern California home with a pool
shaped like an ice cream cone, says dairy operations are inhumane.</TE>
<TE>   "What if the ads showed calves being ripped away from their
mothers?" he said.</TE>

<HD>Strapped Parents Taking Kids' Credit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martha Irvine</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was her first credit card application, or so she thought, prompted
by an offer on her Ohio college campus of a free T-shirt. But a
rejection letter uncovered troubling news: Someone had opened four
credit cards in her name and rung up $50,000 in debt. That someone,
it turned out, was her father.</LD>
<LD>   "I couldn't believe it," said the young woman, who asked not to be
named for fear of humiliating her father, who never faced criminal
charges.</LD>
<LD>   The woman, now 25 and living in Chicago, said she knew her father
was struggling financially. But she never imagined he would fill out
credit card applications sent to his home in her name.</LD>
<TE>   With the proliferation of credit cards, experts say, parents with
financial troubles are tempted to dip into their children's credit.
As cosigners, all they need is a birth date and Social Security
number.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a father in Billings, Mont., was sentenced to five
years in prison for charging $12,000 on credit cards in his
daughter's name.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents put bills -- cable TV, utilities -- in their kids'
names. That's what Teena Touch, a 28-year-old Los Angeles resident,
said her father did. "It started with my summer jobs -- checks my dad
was supposed to deposit but never did," said Touch, whose father was
convicted of embezzlement in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Dionicio Campos, 29, of Chicago said he was stuck untangling
trouble caused by his mother's ex-boyfriend and others using his
Social Security number. "I'm sure a 17-year-old kid isn't worrying
about his mom taking his stuff from him -- but maybe he should,"
Campos said.</TE>
<TE>   Identity theft and credit card fraud have reached an "epidemic
level," said Carl Pergola, national director of fraud investigations
for accounting firm BDO Seidman. Vital information, he said, is being
stolen by parents, co-workers and hucksters.</TE>
<TE>   He said young people whose parents have money problems should
consider obtaining credit reports regularly -- and request that the
three major credit agencies notify them when accounts are opened in
their name.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Federal Trade Commission said, 6% of the 86,168
people who reported identity theft to the agency said a family member
was responsible. Joanna Crane, an attorney who manages the FTC's
identity theft program, said those figures are "only the tip of the
iceberg."</TE>
<TE>   For children whose parents have abused their credit, the options
include paying the debt in big chunks or filing a complaint that
could send the parent to jail.</TE>
<TE>   The 25-year-old from Chicago persuaded her father to consolidate
the $50,000 debt and repay it by having his wages garnished.</TE>

<HD>Outlook for Cruise Vacations Uncertain for Next Year</HD>
<DH>An outbreak of stomach viruses and concerns about possible
war leave the industry without a clear sense of whether passengers
will return.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Veiga</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cruise industry had hoped 2003 would bring an end to the
uncertainty that has shadowed the business since the terrorist
attacks. With the recent outbreak of stomach viruses among ship
passengers, the outlook for next year is even more unclear.</LD>
<LD>   Industry executives and analysts already were wondering if the
United States would go to war with Iraq, possibly prompting cruise
passengers to stay home. The question now is whether the
gastrointestinal virus outbreaks will affect future bookings.</LD>
<LD>   The industry also is waiting to learn whether shareholders will
approve a planned merger between No. 1 Carnival Corp. and No. 3 P&amp;O
Princess Cruises.</LD>
<TE>   The first signs of how the industry will fare overall in 2003, and
whether it has been affected by the on-board ailments, will come in
the "wave season," the period between Jan. 1 and March when most
travelers book summer cruises.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is whether passengers' perception of the cruise
sector changes in a long-term sense once news coverage [of the
outbreaks] has faded," said Robin Farley, an analyst with UBS
Warburg.</TE>
<TE>   Some passengers, including several boarding Holland America's
Amsterdam on its first sailing after a nine-day cleaning, expressed
concerns, but opted to continue with their vacations.</TE>
<TE>   John Ohlmann of Melbourne, Fla., was one of several dozen who
became ill on a Caribbean cruise aboard Disney's Magic. He said the
incident has not soured him on taking another cruise vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the industry is still recovering from the drop-off in
revenue after the Sept. 11 attacks and waiting to see if world events
will affect their business again. Two companies -- American Classic
Voyages and Renaissance Cruises -- were forced to file for bankruptcy
protection, while the rest struggled to fill their cabins.</TE>
<TE>   Cruise lines responded to the attacks by moving ships closer to
home and to ports in secondary markets such as New Orleans, Baltimore
and Corpus Christi, Texas. That trend is expected to continue next
year.</TE>
<TE>   "I see it in fact as the next great growth wave of this industry,
bringing high-quality ships into all kinds of different ports with
large populations," said Colin Veitch, president and chief executive
of Norwegian Cruise Line.</TE>
<TE>   The cruise line recently announced it was adding departures from
Baltimore, Houston and New Orleans, for a total of 12 U.S. ports.</TE>
<TE>   Miami-based Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. expanded new sailings in
2002 from six U.S. cities.</TE>
<TE>   "We probably would have gone there eventually anyhow, but 9/11
gave us an impetus to accelerate," said Richard Fein, Royal
Caribbean's chairman and chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy is in line with some analysts' outlooks for next
year, which favor cruises to the Caribbean and Alaska over Europe,
whether or not there's a war in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   So far, passengers don't seem concerned.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Keung, an analyst with CIBC World Markets Corp., said cruise
operators are "having no problems filling ships as long as a consumer
feels somewhat confident within a 30-day period."</TE>
<TE>   Micky Arison, chairman and chief executive of Miami-based
Carnival, said the impact of a possible war would depend on whether
it is a short or protracted conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "If we are dealing with a relatively short war, I'm not overly
concerned with the impact on the company," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cruise prices have slowly crept up over the year, although prices
for some December cruises have declined. Prices for cruises departing
in January or later appear to be flat, with some increases, according
to a survey by Raymond James &amp; Associates Inc.</TE>
<TE>   If Carnival's $5.4-billion takeover of P&amp;O Princess Cruises is
approved, it is not expected to have much impact on consumers, at
least initially, said Joseph Hovorka, an entertainment and leisure
analyst for Raymond James.</TE>
<TE>   The Carnival-P&amp;O merger would create a powerful company with a
fleet of 64 ships and market share approaching 50% by 2005. No. 2
Royal Caribbean's 24% market share could decline to near 20% by 2005,
said Jill Krutick, a leisure analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.</TE>
<TE>   Royal Caribbean would remain "a powerful No. 2 player, and its
young, high-amenity fleet should enable it to compete effectively,"
she said.</TE>

<HD>Retail Sales Up as Consumers Aid Economy</HD>
<DH>A surge in spending on furniture and electronics fuels
November's advance. But jobless claims rise to an eight-month high.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Siobhan Hughes and Monee Fields-White</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Retail sales rose more than expected in November as consumers, the
engine of a tepid U.S. economic recovery, kept spending while the job
market worsened, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   A surge in spending on furniture and on electronics at stores such
as Best Buy Co. pushed retail sales 0.5% higher, excluding new autos,
the Commerce Department said. At the same time, the Labor Department
said first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose to an
eight-month high.</LD>
<LD>   "We still have a jobless recovery," said Robert Gay, an economist
at Commerzbank in New York. The retail report "is consistent with our
view that consumers are more cautious in the following sense: They're
buying less expensive items and more basic items like electronics,
gadgets and TV sets for Christmas."</LD>
<TE>   Shoppers are shouldering the recovery amid scant signs that
companies have the confidence to invest in plants and equipment. The
unemployment rate is 6%, matching an eight-year high set in April,
and the economy probably grew just 1.4% this quarter, according to
the latest Blue Chip Economic Indicators.</TE>
<TE>   Economists had expected sales excluding new autos to rise 0.2%,
based on the median of 59 forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   The gain in retail sales probably will be insufficient to keep
spending in the fourth quarter from growing at the slowest pace in
almost a decade, economists said.</TE>
<TE>   The 83,000 increase in first-time jobless claims to 441,000 last
week probably was caused by seasonal adjustment problems and
overstates the weakness in the labor market, economists said.</TE>
<TE>   The number of workers continuing to collect unemployment benefits
fell in the last week of November to 3.284 million, the lowest since
September 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at stores open at least a year rose 2% last week from a year
earlier, compared with a 4% gain the week before, according to a Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. and UBS Warburg report. Bank of Tokyo
economist Mike Niemira slashed his December sales forecast by half,
to a 2.5% increase.</TE>
<TE>   The retail statistics also underscore the view of Federal Reserve
policymakers that the economy is improving.</TE>
<TE>   "The limited number of incoming indicators since the November
meeting, taken together, are not inconsistent with the economy
working its way through its current soft spot," central bankers said
Tuesday after announced a decision to keep their target interest rate
at a 41-year low of 1.25%.</TE>
<TE>   While the U.S. economy shows signs of picking up, the European
Central Bank cut its economic growth forecast, auto sales fell and
French factory production tumbled, the latest evidence that the
region's economy is stagnating.</TE>
<TE>   The economies of the dozen nations sharing the euro will grow as
little as 1.1% next year, the ECB said, half the rate predicted in
June. Western European auto sales dropped 6.2% in November, the
European Automobile Manufacturers Assn. said, and France reported
that industrial output fell 0.6% in October, the most in a year.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, sales of furniture and home furnishings rose
in November by 2.3%, the biggest increase since January 2001, after
rising 0.2% in October. Sales at electronics and appliance stores
rose 0.9% after increasing 1% the month before.</TE>
<TE>   "The consumer is continuing to provide support to the economy --
households are not caving or retrenching at this time," said Michael
Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. in New York.
"It bodes well for growth."</TE>
<TE>   Best Buy, the No. 1 U.S. electronics retailer, said last week that
third-quarter sales increased 16%. La-Z-Boy Inc., the largest U.S.
maker of home furniture, last month reported a 1.1% rise in sales
during the three months that ended Oct. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at grocery and beverage stores increased 0.9%, the biggest
gain since June 2000, after rising 0.1% a month earlier. Internet
merchants and catalog sales rose 1.7% after rising 1%.</TE>
<TE>   "Heading down the homestretch into the holiday shopping season,
there's no evidence that consumers are on the verge of collapse,"
said Gregory Miller, chief economist at SunTrust Banks Inc. in
Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate report, the Labor Department disclosed that prices
of imported goods fell 1% in November, the biggest decline in almost
a year and evidence of tame inflation.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department said the deficit in the U.S. current
account -- the broadest measure of international trade because it
includes investments -- narrowed to $127 billion in the third
quarter. In the previous three months, it reached a record $127.6
billion</TE>

<HD>Gold Futures Prices Rise to 5-Year High</HD>
<DH>Global political jitters and a weak dollar enhance the
metal's value as a safe haven for investors. Gold-mining stocks
surge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alden Bentley</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Gold futures prices surged Thursday to their highest level in five
years as global political jitters and a weak dollar put the metal's
2002 safe-haven rally back on track.</LD>
<LD>   Near-term gold futures on the Commodity Exchange jumped $6.60 to
$331.40 an ounce, the highest closing price since 1997. The price is
up 19% this year, from $279 at the end of 2001.</LD>
<LD>   By contrast, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index is down 21.5%
this year.</LD>
<TE>   Silver futures also gained Thursday, with the December contract
rising 11 cents to $4.74 an ounce. But silver is up just 3.5% this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's move broke gold out of recent ranges and came as the
dollar fell and amid several scary news reports, including one that
Iraq may have sold Islamic extremists a chemical weapon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just an accumulation of everything," James Moore of
TheBullionDesk.com said. "The market has generally started to turn a
bit bullish."</TE>
<TE>   Investors also piled into gold-mining stocks, which many prefer to
handling the cumbersome physical commodity.</TE>
<TE>   Barrick Gold gained 63 cents to $15.75, Agnico Eagle jumped $1.04
to $13.73, Newmont Mining  surged $1.11 to $28.11 and Glamis Gold
gained 77 cents to $10.09.</TE>
<TE>   As of last week, the average gold-stock mutual fund was up 47%
year-to-date, according to fund tracker Morningstar Inc. By contrast,
the average general U.S. stock fund was down 19%.</TE>
<TE>   Markets were rattled Thursday after the Washington Post reported
that Bush administration officials said the White House has a
credible report that militants linked to Al Qaeda received a chemical
weapon in Iraq in late October or November.</TE>
<TE>   Also, North Korea said Thursday that it was reactivating a
mothballed nuclear power plant at the center of a suspected 1990s
weapons program in response to a U.S.-led decision to suspend oil aid
to the country.</TE>
<TE>   This follows unsettling news Wednesday that the Bush
administration warned Iraq and other countries that the United States
was prepared to use nuclear weapons to respond to an attack from
weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the weakening dollar also bolsters gold's appeal
because the dollar effectively competes with gold as a safe-haven
account.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, the dollar slumped Thursday against the euro, with
the latter nearing $1.02, its strongest level against the U.S.
currency since early 2000. The euro has rallied from 99.2 cents on
Nov. 25.</TE>
<TE>   "Our gold business is up 15% to 20% over last year," Harvey Stack,
an owner of Stack's Coin Co. in New York, told Bloomberg News.
"People are buying gold because they feel that other investments
won't hold their value as well."</TE>
<TE>   Monthly sales of American Eagle gold coins have averaged 38,200
ounces since July, more than triple the average of 11,920 ounces
during the first six months of the year, according to figures on the
U.S. Mint's Web site, Bloomberg News reported.</TE>
<TE>   Gold had been stuck in a range of $310 to $330 since late May.
Now, traders' attention has shifted to the $340-to-$350 range. That
is expected to be a tough hurdle for the metal.</TE>
<TE>   But continuing programs at major gold companies to unwind
contracts they used to "forward sell" future production at a set
price are continuing to bolster sentiment, experts say. Canada's
Placer Dome on Wednesday reaffirmed its commitment to reducing its
so-called hedge book.</TE>
<TE>   When mining companies balk at pre-selling future production, it
shows they expect prices to rise.</TE>
<TE>   Newmont Mining said last month that it reduced such forward sales
by 928,000 ounces, to 5.8 million ounces, during the third quarter.
The company said it expected an additional reduction of at least
279,000 ounces in the current quarter, according to Bloomberg News.</TE>

<HD>Stocks End Mixed on Rise in Oil, Gas Prices</HD>
<DH>The Dow index ends a two-day rally as it loses 50.74
points. OPEC's decision to reduce production helps boost commodities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks could muster only a mixed close Thursday as action in
commodity markets stole the spotlight.</LD>
<LD>   The Commerce Department reported that sales at the nation's
retailers rose 0.4% in November, the best reading in three months and
in line with analysts' expectations.</LD>
<LD>   But the news failed to trigger a burst of buying on Wall Street,
perhaps because it wasn't surprising. Many retailers had already
announced that late November sales were strong.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow industrials eased 50.74 points, or 0.6%, to 8,538.40,
halting a two-day rally. Still, rising stocks outnumbered losers by
17 to 15 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   In the Nasdaq market, the composite index inched up 2.96 points,
or 0.2%, to 1,399.55, and winners and losers were about even.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks may have been held back in part by a jump in energy prices.
Crude oil rose to a seven- week high after the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to reduce production to keep
prices from falling next year.</TE>
<TE>   OPEC wants oil prices to stay between $22 and $28 a barrel as
demand falls to an annual low in the second quarter. Members say they
can accomplish that goal only if output is reduced to 23 million
barrels a day from an estimated 24.38 million now.</TE>
<TE>   Output reductions from OPEC, which controls about a third of the
world's oil, will take effect Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, near-term crude oil futures rose 61 cents to $28.01 a
barrel.</TE>
<TE>   Natural gas prices also continued to surge, hitting a new 19-month
high, on concerns that cold weather in much of the country has drawn
down supplies faster than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Near-term gas futures in New York jumped 38 cents, or 8.1%, to
$5.09 per million British thermal units.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading, near-term gold futures surged $6.60 to $331.40
an ounce in New York, a five-year high, bolstered by terrorism
concerns and a weaker dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Given the strength in energy prices and in gold, some analysts
said it was surprising that stocks didn't fare worse. Many investors
continue to bet that the economy will improve in 2003, lifting Wall
Street.</TE>
<TE>   But "having already worked in two months of solid performance, the
market looks a little tired here," said Bryan Piskorowski, market
commentator for Prudential Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Among Thursday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Bristol Myers weighed on drug shares, after a Wall Street
Journal story questioned the company's accounting in recent years.
The stock slid $1.80 to $25.35.</TE>
<TE>   Among other drug shares, Johnson &amp; Johnson lost $1.12 to $55.05,
Lilly slid $1.75 to $64.10 and Merck dropped $1.23 to $57.16.</TE>
<TE>   * The biotech sector got a lift after Amgen said it expects to
exceed analysts' 2003 earnings expectations because of strong product
sales. Amgen soared $3.18 to $50.45, Genentech gained $1.07 to $34.55
and Biogen was up 75 cents to $42.53.</TE>
<TE>   * American International Group, the world's largest insurer, lost
$1.53 to $60.09 amid concern a possible settlement of asbestos claims
against Halliburton would force insurers to increase their reserves.</TE>
<TE>   Halliburton said it's close to a $4-billion agreement to settle
current and future asbestos claims.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the insurance sector, Chubb fell $1.16 to $56.33 and XL
Capital lost $1.48 to $81.75.</TE>
<TE>   * Energy stocks rallied as crude oil and natural gas prices
gained. EOG Resources rose $1.21 to $41.49, Burlington Resources
jumped $1.06 to $43, Apache surged $2.06 to $58.84 and Occidental
Petroleum was up 51 cents to $28.60.</TE>
<TE>   Nabors Industries, the world's biggest onshore oil and natural-gas
driller, jumped $1.97 to $37.77. Transocean, the world's largest
offshore oil and natural-gas driller, advanced $1.04 to $24.80.</TE>
<TE>   * In the tech sector, Ciena rose $1.02 to $6.20 after the
networker announced it expects revenue in the current quarter to
increase by as much as 10% from the last quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Among other tech shares, Intel inched up 3 cents to $18.19 and
Cisco Systems was up 26 cents to $14.11.</TE>
<TE>   But IBM fell $1.27 to $80.17, Microsoft lost 49 cents to $54.17
and Seagate Technology lost 32 cents to $11.18.</TE>

<HD>Release of Auto Safety Data Is Disputed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After Firestone tire failures on Ford Explorers led to a national
outcry over vehicle safety, Congress ordered a watchdog agency to
create an early-warning system for automotive defects that could kill
or injure people.</LD>
<LD>   Now, with the computerized system expected to be in full operation
by spring, industry is urging tight restrictions on release of the
data, curbs that safety groups say could gut the reform enacted by
Congress in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The early-warning database is known as ARTEMIS, or Advanced
Retrieval (Tires, Equipment, Motor Vehicles) Information System. It
is meant to provide a commanding view of emerging safety problems by
pulling together closely held industry data on accidents, injuries,
deaths, lawsuits, safety complaints and warranty claims. Updated
quarterly, it would cover vehicles as well as equipment, even
child-safety seats.</LD>
<TE>   Joan Claybrook, president of the Washington-based Public Citizen
advocacy group, is among those who say ARTEMIS data should be
available to all. It could be posted on the Internet, for example.
That way, a motorist whose brakes gave out would be able to access
the manufacturer's latest information on similar problems with the
same model vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   But industry officials say some of the data, particularly warranty
claims, could give competitors an unfair peek at a company's
strengths and weaknesses. And they worry that raw information could
be used to disparage a particular product.</TE>
<TE>   "This data will be used to make comparative claims of superior
quality, reliability and durability that are misleading and
inaccurate," Lyndon Lie, General Motors Corp.'s director of product
investigations, told the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration. The information will not allow for valid comparisons
between manufacturers, he said, because one company may report an
engine computer problem as engine-related and another manufacturer
could report the same problem as electrical.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA is expected to make an initial decision on the scope of
disclosure shortly. The exact timing is uncertain, but agency staff
already are being trained to use the system. Manufacturers are
scheduled to begin submitting data in the spring. The final policy on
disclosing information is subject to review and changes by the White
House.</TE>
<TE>   When then-President Clinton signed the auto safety legislation, he
pledged "maximum public availability" of information. But it has been
left to the Bush administration to implement the system, and
disclosure of auto safety data is shaping up as a major test of its
regulatory policy. The administration has broadly acknowledged
business concerns that some data collected by the government should
not be released.</TE>
<TE>   The auto safety law, known as the Transportation Recall
Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation, or TREAD, Act, was
passed with strong bipartisan support. A congressional investigation
had found that manufacturers failed to warn safety officials at NHTSA
of a pattern of problems with certain Firestone tires.
Bridgestone/Firestone recalled the tires in August 2000, but the tire
maker and Ford had received reports of trouble well before.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA Ignored Tip</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA itself was accused of letting consumers down. The agency
failed to act on a 1998 tip from State Farm Insurance Cos., which had
documented the tire failure trend from its customer claims.
Ultimately, more than 270 people died and at least 800 were injured
in crashes blamed on failed Firestone tires.</TE>
<TE>   The surest way to prevent the recurrence of a similar debacle
would be to release the data broadly, in the eyes of Public Citizen's
Claybrook. "Early warning is the heart and soul of the TREAD Act,"
she said. Congress intended "to end the silence surrounding defect
information, not to reinvent the culture of cloaked secrecy."</TE>
<TE>   But the industry is concerned that quarterly Internet updates
could turn into open season for plaintiffs' lawyers and other
critics. And because the majority of safety recalls are voluntarily
initiated by manufacturers, the companies contend that unbridled
disclosure of sensitive information could create an adversarial
atmosphere that undermines safety.</TE>
<TE>   "NHTSA's ability to obtain information cooperatively from the
private sector is directly related to the agency's ability to protect
that information from public disclosure," the Alliance of Automobile
Manufacturers pointedly noted in a filing with the agency.</TE>
<TE>   A NHTSA spokesman declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Automakers Hear First</TE>
<TE>   The agency acknowledges that it now has much less information on
safety problems than do automakers. Many consumers are unaware that
they can report a problem to government investigators. But most
customers do contact the manufacturer with their complaints.
Companies carefully track customer complaints, making these files a
rich source of data.</TE>
<TE>   The new database would let NHTSA tap the information resources of
the industry, rather than continue to rely on the government's file
of consumer complaints.</TE>
<TE>   But the automakers' alliance has asked the agency to guard
information "not customarily disclosed to the public by the
submitting manufacturer," or data that "would harm the competitive
position of the submitting manufacturer." It recommends that NHTSA
release early-warning data only after it has decided to open an
investigation into a potentially defective product. That approach is
in line with the way the agency has traditionally operated.</TE>
<TE>   When safety investigators suspect a problem, they request company
data on accidents, injuries, deaths and consumer complaints. As the
investigation moves forward, NHTSA places the company information in
a public file.</TE>
<TE>   Yet critics say the traditional approach broke down in the
Firestone case, and there is no guarantee it will be foolproof in the
future.</TE>
<TE>   "That is where we were before the scandal of the summer of 2000,
and why would anyone want to go back to that situation?" asked Randy
Whitfield, a leading auto safety researcher based in Maryland. "If
what we lived through has any lesson to teach, it's that not all the
wisdom that exists about motor vehicle problems resides in NHTSA.
There should be more pairs of eyes looking."</TE>
<TE>   Congress did not provide explicit guidance on what early-warning
information should be released to the public, but left that
determination to the Transportation Department.</TE>
<TE>   That means Congress did not intend for the information to be
automatically released, industry officials maintain.</TE>
<TE>   "We have taken a moderate position," said Robert Strassburger,
vice president for safety with the the automakers' alliance. "There
is certainly information that will be submitted to NHTSA that should
be made public, but conversely, there is other information that is
proprietary." Once the agency opens an investigation, "then
information relating to that particular inquiry should be made
available to the public," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Congress felt that a balance had to be struck, according to Mike
Waldron, a spokesman for Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), one of the TREAD
Act's main authors. That balance must decidedly improve the current
lot of consumers, Waldron said, though some statistical information
may remain confidential.</TE>
<TE>   "Where life-and-death issues are concerned ... the consumer has a
right to know," said Waldron. "When we wrote our bill, our intent was
that information such as the congressional investigation uncovered
would have been disclosed earlier. There would have been a mechanism
for getting the tires replaced, and that would have saved the lives
of hundreds."</TE>

<HD>Cape Town Relishes Its Role as a Stand-In</HD>
<DH>The South African city's commercial trade is booming thanks
to its economy, weather and an ability to look like other locales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Solomon Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CAPE TOWN, South Africa</DL>
<LD>In the commercial, a man in Toronto wins free tickets to a Canadian
sporting event. He drives along urban avenues, smiling at his good
fortune. Next he goes to a nightclub packed with the kind of party
crowd that only inhabits beer ads. Finally, he's cheering alongside
his countrymen in a Canadian arena.</LD>
<LD>   None of this, however, was shot anywhere near the land of moose
and Mounties.</LD>
<LD>   This message was brought to you by the good people of Cape Town --
Africa's most European city and one of the world's most popular
television commercial filming locations.</LD>
<TE>   Recent figures released by the Entertainment Industry Development
Corp. in Los Angeles show that although filming of theatrical
features and television shows has rebounded, the number of local TV
commercial productions has declined dramatically since January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Cape Town's commercials trade is booming.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt that South Africa has emerged as one of the
largest non-U.S. foreign production centers for commercials, and
that's happened fairly rapidly," said Steve Caplan, a spokesman for
the Assn. of Independent Commercial Producers.</TE>
<TE>   South Africa's currency, the rand, is so depressed that even
advertising firms from bargain-basement locations such as Canada,
Spain and Australia are flying to this resort town on Africa's chin.
Molson's Beer, Nestle, MasterCard, Microsoft and other companies film
more than 1,000 television commercials a year in South Africa,
pumping $187 million annually into the local economy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just another example of producers seeking cost savings at
the expense of crews in the U.S.," said Bruce Doering of the
L.A.-based Cinematographers Guild. The globalization of advertisement
production spiked in 2000 after a six-month actors strike. Still
intent on hawking goods, advertisers found thrifty fields abroad.
Some never came back.</TE>
<TE>   Caplan said the number of television ads filmed locally in October
was 40% below the five-year average.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just that the commercial business is slow in Los Angeles
right now," he said. "This is happening because it's a global
business now, and if L.A. wants its share, it has to be competitive
with places like South Africa, New Zealand and Prague."</TE>
<TE>   Hard to Compete</TE>
<TE>   But how does Los Angeles compete with a place like South Africa,
where industry studies show that filming is 30% to 40% cheaper than
in Europe or the U.S. and 20% cheaper than in Australia? Actors'
wages here are frequently less than half the U.S. rate, and South
Africans aren't entitled to royalty checks. A film technician who
earns $550 a day in Santa Monica and $290 in Vancouver would be paid
$165 in Cape Town.</TE>
<TE>   Even Canadian producers such as Julie Gervais, who filmed the beer
commercial, found South Africa a less expensive location than her
home country. Her client authorized her to film here, at the risk of
breaking Canadian film union agreements to stem runaway production.
Gervais agreed to discuss her recent commercial shoot on the
condition that the client company not be identified.</TE>
<TE>   But South Africa's economy isn't the only reason for the
burgeoning production business.</TE>
<TE>   "I started coming here a year and half ago, when we were looking
for vineyards in winter," Gervais said. As she shot her beer
commercial in balmy Cape Town, her native Montreal shivered in the
snow. This region's climate is comparable to that of Los Angeles, and
rainfall is nearly as infrequent, making it ideal for companies
looking to bathe their products in sunshine.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear whether South Africa is the cause, but Doering said
film and television unions have noticed a drop this year in the
number of productions in Miami, the traditional winter retreat for
U.S. commercial productions.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Key, founder of Moonlighting Films, South Africa's busiest
film company, said that beyond weather, the nation has other inherent
advantages. Only a short distance from his Cape Town headquarters,
"we have deserts, we have mountains, we have the sea, we have cities
and parks -- and then there's the rest of South Africa."</TE>
<TE>   Moonlighting's offices, located in a converted downtown warehouse,
are strewn with as many storyboards, Ethernet connections and goateed
power-lunchers as any Westside production house. The firm is another
example of why South Africa is attracting advertisers. In comparison
to other cheap locations such as Argentina or Portugal, South Africa
is well-stocked with talent.</TE>
<TE>   Earl McDaniel, head of production at Partizan Entertainment, a
Hollywood-based commercial producer, said South African firms are
competitive internationally.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has bid them at one point or another," he said. "A lot
of times, when you go outside of L.A. or New York, you have to worry
about how they work -- you go to Spain and they go on siesta at 4
o'clock, everything shuts down. They're much more cosmopolitan in
Cape Town; you don't have to worry."</TE>
<TE>   An increasing number of South African companies are becoming
advertising houses in their own right. Cape Town companies such as
Velocity Africa Film Production Services, Egg Film Service and Giant
Films regularly compete with European, Hollywood and New York
producers.</TE>
<TE>   Most Cape Town firms, however, have emulated Moonlighting's focus
on logistics -- a crucial niche in Africa. Once a foreign studio or
advertising firm has worked up a script and hired a director, it can
call one of more than 60 production service companies in South Africa
to scout locations, provide equipment, cast actors and extras, hire
catering services and solve other problems a commercial shoot might
encounter.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, Hollywood studios are hiring South African
production service companies on big-budget feature projects. When
Columbia TriStar shot the 2000 film "I Dreamed of Africa," the studio
hired Moonlighting to handle logistics in South Africa's
Kwazulu-Natal province, which stood in for Kenya. Moonlighting also
facilitates filming in other parts of Africa -- using Mozambique and
Ghana, for example, to double for Zaire in the 2001 boxing biopic
"Ali," starring Will Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Key's business partner, Genevieve Hofmeyr, said fear of crime
remained one of the biggest challenges for film companies. South
Africa's high crime rate is as well known as its apartheid legacy.
According to Interpol statistics, the nation's murder rate is 122 per
100,000 people, compared with 5 per 100,000 in the United States.
Rape is so common here that some families have installed accordion
gates inside their homes to protect their bedrooms at night.</TE>
<TE>   But Hofmeyr said most of the trepidation of her country fades once
people arrive.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't realize that when you're walking the streets of Cape
Town, you could be in San Francisco or L.A.," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some advertising producers have even asked Hofmeyr whether they
would be able to find enough white extras to make commercials look as
if they were set in American or European settings.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, most of the television locations here resemble other
places. German luxury cars flash past vineyards that could just as
easily be in Napa Valley or the south of France. Beautiful women
enjoy soft drinks on beaches that could be Greek or Antiguan.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, looking at these commercials and at local industry
literature such as "The Filmmakers Guide to South Africa," it is easy
to forget that South Africa is a predominately black nation. Many
industry watchers say the nation's film trade has not shirked the
legacy of racial apartheid.</TE>
<TE>   "Cape Town is a beautiful city. But in order to shoot here, you
have drive from the airport and pass by all the squatter camps," said
Gersh Kgamedi, one of South Africa's few black film directors. "The
only reason foreign crews can use us as a backdrop to replace America
or Europe is because all the black people are hidden behind the
mountain."</TE>
<TE>   An Old World Order</TE>
<TE>   The South African parliament held hearings last month on the
dearth of black film industry workers and the lack of advertising
targeting the black middle class. Lawmaker Nke Kekana, who chaired
those hearings, said South Africa's "advertising and marketing
industry is still stuck in an old-order world where white audiences
matter more than black audiences."</TE>
<TE>   The economic damage that the white-dominated apartheid system
wrought on the black majority of South Africa also has stymied
efforts to graduate from logistical services and television
advertising to feature films, said Eddie Mbalo, head of the
government-funded National Film and Video Foundation. Kekana counted
only three theaters in the township of Soweto, where 3 million blacks
live just outside of Johannesburg. And even if there were more
theaters, it's unlikely many people here would be able to finance
local productions or pay for movie tickets.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't have food on the table and roofs over their heads,"
said Kathy English-Brower, a film industry consultant in South
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   English-Brower said the only way South Africa's commercial
production companies could evolve into bona fide studios is by
diversifying the ranks of directors and investors and creating "local
content" that could be marketed internationally.</TE>
<TE>   A team of British, Canadian and South African filmmakers just
wrapped "Stander," a $15-million movie based on the true story of an
apartheid-era South African police captain who became a bank robber.</TE>
<TE>   Suzanne Kay and Mark Bamford, an American wife-and-husband
filmmaking team, will shoot a movie next year about post-apartheid
race relations called "Cape of Good Hope."</TE>
<TE>   They plan to use mostly local talent and an interracial ensemble
cast that will include Djimon Hounsou of "Amistad" and "Gladiator."</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard to do this as outsiders," said Bamford, who worked as
a Hollywood screenwriter before moving to Cape Town a year ago. "But
I think we have a good understanding of what international audiences
want to know about this place. And we hope this will open doors for
others by making a commercially successful South African film."</TE>
<TE>   The movie will be the couple's first feature. They are financing
it themselves -- something they say they never would have been able
to afford to do in the U.S.</TE>

<HD>Vietnam Seen as a Safe Haven for Tourists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Lamb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam</DL>
<LD>HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam -- Ever since a terrorist attacked in Bali
killed 191 people in October, Tony Nong has been working 20-hour
days. He's hired two additional office workers and several guides.
But the recent tourist boom still has him scrambling to find hotel
rooms and answer inquiries from prospective tourists.</LD>
<LD>   "Bali changed everything," said Nong, a Vietnamese American who,
with his mother, runs this nation's oldest privately owned tourism
company, Ann Tours. "Usually we get four or five inquires a day on
our Web site from people planning trips six months in advance. Now
we're getting 15-20 a day, and they want to come in two weeks."</LD>
<LD>   After the October attack on the Indonesian nightclubs and
terrorist alerts that Western embassies issued for many Southeast
Asian nations, Nong and others say, tourists began looking for
alternate destinations that offered security. And what came up on the
radar screen of many was Vietnam -- a Communist country that in the
decades after World War II fought wars with France, the United
States, Cambodia, China and itself.</LD>
<TE>   The Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy
Company today rates Vietnam as the region's safest country for
tourists.</TE>
<TE>   Being considered a low risk as a target of terrorism has sent
tourism surging. City and resort hotels that had been chugging along
at 60% occupancy before the Bali attack are fully booked well into
this month. Vietnam Airlines is predicting a 13% increase in
passenger loads for 2002. The number of tourists visiting Vietnam
this year is expected to surpass the 1.2 million record set in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "From a humanitarian point of view, we don't want to capitalize on
anyone's misfortune, but the reality is we are drawing more tourists
because of terrorism elsewhere," said Nguyen Van Luu, a spokesman for
the National Administration of Tourism. "Security and safety is one
of the things we're focusing on in international marketing, because
we look to tourism as a spearhead of our economic development."</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam is an unlikely target or breeding ground for terrorists
for several reasons. First, its urban population is largely
homogeneous, composed of Buddhists and Christians. Its security
apparatus is one of the most omnipresent and effective in the region.
Its people treasure their hard-earned stability and terrorist cells
would find little popular support, political analysts said. And
terrorism aside, Vietnam is an uncommonly safe country with a
minuscule crime rate compared to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "I know of very few cities where you can get into a taxi at 3 in
the morning, go to any area in Hanoi and have no fear for your
personal safety," said Nisha Agrawal, acting head of the World Bank's
Vietnam office. "That's empowering, for residents or visitors."</TE>
<TE>   Tourism is a major source of hard currency throughout Southeast
Asia. It is a $7-billion industry in Thailand, which attracts 10
million tourists a year but saw the cancellation of 32,000 hotel
room-nights when travel warnings were issued for Muslim-populated
areas. Indonesia earns $5.6 billion from tourism -- 60% of which was
generated by Bali, before the October attack. Today hotels on the
island barely have enough guests to stay open.</TE>
<TE>   The Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations put terrorism and tourism
high on the agenda at its annual summit, which was held last month in
Phnom Penh, Cambodia. It asked foreign governments to tone down what
the association called unsubstantiated travel warnings, which are
scaring away cash-rich visitors. The group said it would hold its
2003 summit in Bali.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Vietnam's five-star security, the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi
closed on the first anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, as did
several other American embassies in the region, because of
intelligence reports of possible terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The Vietnamese complained about the closure, saying it was
unnecessary and brought undeserved negative attention. Among the U.S.
government's concerns were that the embassy in Hanoi fronts on a busy
street and lacks heavy barricades to protect it against a suicide
bomber in a car. Al DeMatteis, a contractor from Brooklyn who lives
and works in Hanoi, came up with a temporary solution: He now parks
his three dump trucks in front of the embassy's main entrance.</TE>

<HD>Vitesse Hoping for a Rebound -- Again</HD>
<DH>The Camarillo firm is being repositioned as a maker of
chips for data storage and other applications that show signs of
growth</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Glenda McCarthy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's start-up time again at Vitesse Semiconductor Corp., the
15-year-old chip maker in Camarillo.</LD>
<LD>   Just a few years ago, the company was riding on the coattails of
the booming telecommunications industry. Its long-distance chips
accounted for 75% of its revenue, the company was doubling in size
each year, and its stock soared above $100 in early 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Then oversupply of telecom capacity produced one of the biggest
meltdowns the technology sector has ever seen. One of the victims was
Vitesse.</LD>
<TE>   So founder and Chief Executive Lou Tomasetta embarked on a
familiar path, refocusing his company on new opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "The nature of our business is that anything you did three years
ago is obsolete," said Tomasetta, who holds four degrees, including a
doctorate in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. "You have to reinvent yourself every few years."</TE>
<TE>   This time, Tomasetta is reinventing Vitesse as a maker of chips
used for data storage, local area networks and other applications
that are showing signs of growth. Those chips now account for the
bulk of Vitesse's sales, with revenue from those areas growing 10%
every quarter, Tomasetta said. Meanwhile, telecom chips now account
for just 15% of the company's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The turnaround effort seems to be well-timed. A recent report by
the Semiconductor Industry Assn. found that the chip sector appears
to be making a modest recovery, after the worst downturn in the
industry's history.</TE>
<TE>   Tomasetta concurred: "I think we've passed the bottom already."</TE>
<TE>   That would be good news for Vitesse investors. The company's stock
now is trading for just a few dollars, closing down 3 cents Thursday
to $2.64 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   For its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, Vitesse had an
operating loss of 9 cents a share as its revenue declined 11% to
$38.1 million. The company reported net income of $3.7 million, or 2
cents, contrasted with a net loss of $59.2 million, or 30 cents, a
year ago. The results included $8 million in charges and a
$30-million gain related to the company's buyback of $190.1 million
in subordinated convertible debt for $140.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   For the full 2002 fiscal year, Vitesse had a net loss of $883.5
million, or $4.45 a share, including gains and charges. Revenue
plunged 58% to $162.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Tomasetta has told Wall Street that Vitesse will do whatever it
takes to get back to profitability by the end of the current fiscal
year. His management team has been working to control costs in the
wake of six consecutive quarters of declining overall revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 400 jobs have been cut in the last 18 months, leaving the
company with about 900 employees. An additional 50 job cuts are
expected. Executive salaries also have been trimmed 10% to 25%.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Vitesse detailed an aggressive debt repurchase it
conducted during the fourth quarter that analysts considered a savvy
move to tune up its balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts have expressed hope for the current restructuring.
They say Vitesse has recovered from much graver circumstances than
the current downturn.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll get to profitability," said Arnab Chandra, an analyst
with Lehman Bros., which owns no stock in the company. "They've
navigated the company out of deep doldrums in the past."</TE>
<TE>   The company started out making powerful chips for supercomputers.
When the market for supercomputers evaporated in the mid-1990s,
Vitesse turned its attention to chips it was developing for the
telecommunications industry, which was beginning its spectacular rise
following deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   And Vitesse steered a dazzling turnaround -- until the telecom
sector cratered.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Donovan, chief analyst at Gartner Dataquest, said Vitesse
is wisely managing its current diversification.</TE>
<TE>   "They really beat other companies to the punch on storage," said
Donovan, who does not own stock in the company.</TE>
<TE>   But Wall Street is expecting more tough work ahead. Several
analysts have lowered their forecasts for the current quarter.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, Tomasetta and other senior executives demonstrated
their confidence in the company by buying Vitesse shares as the stock
slid toward the $1 mark in August.</TE>
<TE>   During August and September, Tomasetta bought 200,000 shares, and
an additional 350,000 were purchased by senior executives Yatin Mody,
Ira Deyhimy and Richard Riker, and director James A. Cole. All of
them bought their shares for between $1.18 and $1.74 each, according
to regulatory filings.</TE>
<TE>   Tomasetta isn't shy about telling analysts when he thinks they're
wrong about his firm. Even when it was soaring, he said, they missed
what was really happening.</TE>
<TE>   "When we were growing at 100% a year, most of them were
forecasting that it was going to keep going on forever," Tomasetta
said. "They didn't see the top, and I don't think any of them see the
bottom."</TE>

<HD>UPN to 'Star Trek' Film: Help Beam Ratings Up</HD>
<DH>Fabled TV franchise is struggling. Network hopes movie
tie-in will come to the rescue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Meg James</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The "Star Trek" franchise has long been a raft for the fledgling UPN
network to Klingon to.</LD>
<LD>   But ratings for its latest "Star Trek" spinoff, "Enterprise," have
fallen more than 60% since its debut last year, leaving executives at
the Viacom Inc. unit to wonder whether the show is nearing its final
TV frontier.</LD>
<LD>   Hoping to re-energize the program, Viacom executives are looking
to "Star Trek: Nemesis," which opens in movie theaters today, to lure
viewers to the small screen as well. Moviegoers at more than 100
Loews Cineplex theaters nationwide will see a 40-second trailer
promoting the TV show. And fans can enter drawings on the network's
Web site and in Loews theater lobbies to win a guest role on the
series.</LD>
<TE>   "This is about getting viewers more aware of our show," said Dawn
Ostroff, UPN's entertainment president.</TE>
<TE>   The marketing blitz fulfills a mandate handed down this year by
Viacom's president, Mel Karmazin, to make promoting the $4-billion
"Star Trek" franchise a corporate priority. At the same time, UPN
executives say they are making plans to broaden the network's reach
beyond its core crew of Trekkies.</TE>
<TE>   As one executive put it, they can't rely on the "Star Trek"
franchise to be "the end-all, be-all," that it has been in the past.</TE>
<TE>   More than 13 million people last year tuned into the first episode
of "Enterprise," which unfolds in the pioneering days of deep space
travel, a century before the 1960s space cowboy Capt. James T. Kirk
was zipping around the universe.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, 4.7 million viewers were watching. Although most TV
programs experience audience drop-offs after season premieres, UPN
executives and the show's producers were depending on "Enterprise" to
exhibit more of that storied "Star Trek" staying power.</TE>
<TE>   Three previous incarnations produced by Paramount Television --
"Star Trek: The Next Generation" (1987-1994), "Star Trek: Deep Space
Nine" (1993-1999) and "Star Trek: Voyager" (1995-2001), the show that
launched the UPN network -- all lasted seven seasons.</TE>
<TE>   UPN executives, however, won't say how many seasons they expect
"Enterprise" to survive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still one of UPN's highest-rated shows, although these days
that's not saying too much," said Steve Sternberg, a TV analyst with
Magna Global USA, an advertising buying firm.</TE>
<TE>   UPN's other signature shows also are sliding. Ratings for the
network this season are down 18%.</TE>
<TE>   World Wrestling Entertainment's "Smackdown" is pulling in nearly 2
million fewer viewers on Thursday nights than during the show's peak
three years ago. And onetime cult sensation "Buffy the Vampire
Slayer," which UPN wrested last year from its archrival, the WB
network, by paying $2.3 million an episode, is losing the Tuesday
night ratings wars. WB's cheaper upstarts, "Gilmore Girls" and
"Smallville," are faring better.</TE>
<TE>   Advertisers and analysts say 8-year-old UPN has never gained
traction because it has no clear identity and a patchwork of
programming.</TE>
<TE>   Its successful Monday night lineup of comedies, including
"Girlfriends" and "One on One," has been a sunny spot in an otherwise
bleak year. Still, most Monday night viewers don't return to UPN
later in the week.</TE>
<TE>   The network canceled its heavily hyped new show "Haunted" after
three episodes produced skeletal ratings. The network attempted to
lure Monday viewers to Wednesday by airing a remake of "The Twilight
Zone" after "Enterprise." But instead of winning new viewers, UPN
might have unintentionally hurt the "Star Trek" spinoff by pairing it
with a show panned by critics and viewers.</TE>
<TE>   "There is some erosion in ratings, but our situation is far better
than it was a year ago," said Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS,
another Viacom unit, who has taken charge of UPN.</TE>
<TE>   Moonves inherited the struggling network this year because Viacom
was frustrated by continuing losses. The consolidation helped trim
UPN's deficit from $100 million last year to an estimated $40 million
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Advertisers are unfazed by the lower ratings for "Enterprise." For
pushing upscale products such as Lexus, Audi and Nintendo, the show
is still a dependable source of the most desirable viewers:
Tech-savvy men ages 18 to 54.</TE>
<TE>   Executive producer Rick Berman, who also produced the "Star Trek
Nemesis" movie, defended "Enterprise," despite the lower ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "Creatively," he said, " 'Enterprise' is as good or even better
than ever."</TE>
<TE>   Others disagree, however, and the topic has generated endless
discussion on Internet message boards and in chat rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Some fans love the show, spending hours discussing plot lines, the
theme song, the crew members' uniforms and the realism of the
technology aboard the Enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   But many have written the show off, saying it has failed to
capture the imagination of "Star Trek" loyalists.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not breaking new ground," said Steve Krutzler, editor of
TrekWeb.com, a site devoted to "Star Trek." "The show doesn't seem
very inspired."</TE>
<TE>   TV analyst Larry D. Gerbrandt, chief content officer for Kagan
World Media, a research firm in Carmel, said the series is no longer
on the cutting edge.</TE>
<TE>   "They've sort of lost the touchstones in a way," Gerbrandt said.
"Capt. Kirk and Picard were there to save the universe every other
episode. These were stories of universal proportions. But it seems
like over the last couple of years the stories have gotten smaller
and less important.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's trans-warp drive when you really need it?"</TE>

<HD>Audit Board Gets Ready for Business</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas S. Mulligan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The new Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, still without a
permanent chairman, a headquarters, a budget or a Web site, has
nevertheless begun a flurry of activity, hiring a headhunter to scout
executives, touring office space and lining up vendors for phones and
equipment.</LD>
<LD>   The five-member board, created by Congress in the summer to police
the scandal-ridden accounting industry, is waiting for a chairman to
replace former FBI Director William H. Webster.</LD>
<LD>   Members said they hoped the process would be sped up by President
Bush's nomination Tuesday of William H. Donaldson as chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC oversees the board and
appoints its members.</LD>
<TE>   The board faces an April 25 deadline to begin registering and
investigating auditing firms, and a key member of Congress said
Thursday that the deadline might be impossible to meet.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), ranking Democrat on the House
Financial Services Committee, said Congress recessed for the holidays
without passing legislation that would enable the Treasury Department
to release operating funds for the accounting board.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, despite his resignation, Webster hasn't stopped
working for the board. He attended an all-day organizational meeting
last week and missed a 90-minute conference call Tuesday only because
of an angioplasty procedure, board member Willis D. Gradison Jr., a
retired Republican congressman from Ohio, said in an interview this
week.</TE>
<TE>   Webster said last month that he would quit the post amid questions
about his role as a director of U.S. Technologies Inc., which fired
its auditors in 2001 after they criticized the firm's financial
controls.</TE>
<TE>   That controversy in turn sparked the resignations of SEC Chairman
Harvey L. Pitt and his top accountant, Robert Herdman.</TE>
<TE>   Gradison said the accounting board hired Los Angeles-based
executive search firm Korn/Ferry International to help it select its
half-dozen top executives: a general counsel, a chief auditor, a
director of inspection and registration, a director of enforcement
and investigations, a director of human resources and a director of
public affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Another key hire is an interim administrator to run the office for
60 to 90 days while the board organizes its budgeting, hiring and
equipment purchasing, Gradison said.</TE>
<TE>   Board member Charles D. Niemeier, who has been chief accountant
for the SEC's enforcement division, said in a speech Wednesday to the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants that he wants the
board to have a strong hand in drafting rules for auditors. He said
he expected the board to hire as many as 500 people.</TE>
<TE>   Gradison and Niemeier said Donaldson's appointment should speed
the naming of a chairman.</TE>

<HD>Digital Books Case in Jury's Hands</HD>
<DH>The panel must decide whether ElcomSoft broke copyright law
intentionally.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph Menn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal jury in San Jose began deliberating the fate of a Russian
software company Thursday in a case that may guide the future of
criminal penalties under a 1998 copyright protection law.</LD>
<LD>   Elcom Ltd., better known as ElcomSoft Co., is fighting five
charges that it violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act by
briefly distributing computer programs that unlock Adobe Systems
Inc.'s encrypted electronic books.</LD>
<LD>   The case is the first criminal trial under the DMCA, though
individuals charged under the act have made plea agreements in
Sacramento and Nebraska. ElcomSoft programmer Dmitry Sklyarov was
arrested at a convention last summer, but the charges against him
were dropped in exchange for an agreement to testify in the case.</LD>
<TE>   The DMCA prohibits sales of goods aimed at disabling copyright
protection mechanisms, such as those in Adobe's e-book software.
Sklyarov's arrest and the ensuing trial prompted fierce criticism
from computer engineers and civil liberties groups, who say that such
enforcement will hurt free speech and technical innovation.</TE>
<TE>   In closing arguments Thursday, lawyers for both sides told jurors
in U.S. District Court in San Jose that there was little debate over
whether ElcomSoft distributed the programs for a few days in June
before Adobe complained. An Adobe employee testified that no
illegitimate copies have been found that were made with the ElcomSoft
product.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, lawyers asked the jury to try to divine what was in the
minds of Sklyarov and the brothers who founded the company, Alex and
Vladimir Katalov. That's crucial because the prosecution must show
that ElcomSoft acted "willfully," which District Judge Ronald Whyte
defined as knowing that they were going to break the law.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Scott Frewing stressed that ElcomSoft touted
the ability of its $79 and $99 Advanced eBook Processor programs to
render e-books free from all restrictions, and he pointed to Vladimir
Katalov's testimony that he was familiar with the DMCA, which was
enacted in response to entertainment industry fears about Internet
piracy.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to sell as much software as they could," Frewing
said, warning that the jury wouldn't want to live in a world without
effective copyrights.</TE>
<TE>   But ElcomSoft defense attorney Joseph Burton said it defied common
sense that such an established company would intentionally break the
law. He noted that ElcomSoft sells electronic forensic tools, such as
those for recovering passwords, to the Internal Revenue Service, the
Department of Justice and Fortune 500 companies.</TE>
<TE>   Burton said that ElcomSoft sold the e-book programs on its Web
site and advertised it in letters to law enforcement and other
customers in the sincere belief that it would be helpful in making
backup copies of e-books and transferring them from one machine to
another. Those two activities are generally considered fair use, but
the DMCA makes no exception for products intended to promote fair
use.</TE>
<TE>   The executives may well have been wrong about the law, but they
acted in good faith and conducted their sales openly, Burton said. "I
would submit to you that criminal conduct is not carried on out in
the open."</TE>
<TE>   If convicted on all counts, ElcomSoft could face fines of as much
as $2.5 million. The jury will resume deliberations today.</TE>

<HD>Amgen Expects Sales to Soar</HD>
<DH>Forecast of 40% growth this year and next lifts stock. Firm
hints second Enbrel factory is on track.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Denise Gellene</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Biotechnology giant Amgen Inc. forecast strong sales growth for its
drugs in 2003, offering the biggest hint yet that a long-awaited
second factory for its much-in-demand rheumatoid arthritis drug
should open on schedule.</LD>
<LD>   The Thousand Oaks-based company said it would end 2002 with a 40%
jump in sales, driven by accelerating growth of second-generation
medications to treat anemia and chemotherapy-related infections. And
Amgen said its sales gains would continue at the same pace or better
in 2003, exceeding its previous bullish forecast in the 30% range.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street responded enthusiastically, driving Amgen's stock
almost 7% higher Thursday. The shares closed at $50.45, up $3.18, on
Nasdaq. Amgen's market capitalization is now $64.9 billion, the
highest of any Southland-based company and nearly twice the market
value of Burbank-based Walt Disney Co.</LD>
<TE>   Next year "will be a big year of performance for Amgen,"
Prudential Securities analyst John Sonnier said in a research note.</TE>
<TE>   Among the greatest challenges facing Amgen, in the eyes of analyst
Martin Auster of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, is maintaining its
supercharged growth rate beyond 2003. Citing what he called "the law
of large numbers," Auster said Amgen must generate new revenue of $1
billion in 2004 to achieve an earnings growth rate in the mid-teens.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen should end 2002 with $4 billion in cash that it could use to
license promising drugs or make an acquisition. Chairman and Chief
Executive Kevin W. Sharer said that Amgen is "always looking for
candidates to add to the pipeline" but that he was "not predicting
anything about acquisitions or targets."</TE>
<TE>   Much of Amgen's growth in the coming year will come from its
anti-inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel. Amgen estimated
2003 Enbrel sales would increase as much as 75% to $1.4 billion, a
projection that assumes its new plant in Rhode Island would receive
government approval by March. The factory is needed to meet
extraordinary demand for Enbrel, the crown jewel of Amgen's
$9.6-billion purchase of Immunex Corp. in July. Capacity constraints
have kept sales of the drug at or below 2001 levels.</TE>
<TE>   The company's 2003 growth forecast for its two newest drugs,
Neulasta and Aranesp, also exceeded most analysts' rosy expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen said sales of anti-infection drugs Neupogen and Neulasta
should range from $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion, up from about $1.7
billion this year. More than half of those sales should come from
Neulasta, a once-a-week injectable drug for chemotherapy-related
infections that was approved in January by the Food and Drug
Administration. Neupogen, which goes off patent in 2006, is
administered daily.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of Amgen's anemia drugs Epogen and longer-acting version
Aranesp should range from $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion in 2003, the
company said. Analysts expect sales of the anemia drugs to reach $2.6
billion this year.</TE>
<TE>   Sharer said in an interview that Aranesp sales have accelerated
steadily since summer, when Amgen received government approval to
promote the drug for cancer-related anemia, its largest potential
market. The outcome of the company's closely watched lawsuit against
Medicare over reimbursement for the drug shouldn't affect the
forecast, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen's share of the anemia drug market in the United States is
growing at the expense of rival Johnson &amp; Johnson, Sharer added. J&amp;J
sells a product here identical to Epogen under a license from Amgen.</TE>
<TE>   Aranesp sales in the United States are benefiting as well from 25%
to 30% growth in the size of the cancer-related anemia market, Sharer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Aranesp also has gained in Europe, where J&amp;J has experienced
quality problems with a modified version of its anemia drug.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen said total revenue in 2003 may climb as high as $7.8
billion. Earnings per share should range from $1.50 to $1.60, an
increase of 25% to 30%, after merger-related costs of about 20 cents
a share.</TE>

<HD>Studios Go on Offensive Against Film Sanitizers</HD>
<DH>Companies are expected to mount an assault on firms that
alter movies to clean them up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Cieply</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood's big studios may soon dirty their hands in the fight over
sanitized films.</LD>
<LD>   Eight major film companies are expected to file copyright
infringement claims as early as today against CleanFlicks of Colorado
and other firms that alter movies to remove scenes and language they
deem offensive, according to people familiar with the studios' plans.
The move will boost substantially the position of film directors, who
have asked a federal court to stop the unauthorized editing.</LD>
<LD>   The studios had been reluctant to join the ongoing legal battle
between sanitizers and directors, largely for fear of seeming to
oppose advocates of film decency. "We were dragged in kicking and
screaming," one executive said.</LD>
<TE>   In Hollywood, the fight raises an uncomfortable reminder of the
political battle over marketing of violence to youth two years ago,
and seems particularly ill-timed as studios prepare to sell a number
of films that appear harder-edged than the PG-13 rated fare that has
dominated schedules since the violence flap.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co.'s Miramax unit will release director Martin
Scorsese's "Gangs of New York" and Quentin Tarantino's "Kill Bill," a
pair of expensive, violence-oriented films; AOL Time Warner Inc.'s
New Line will distribute commercial director Marcus Nispel's remake
of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."</TE>
<TE>   CleanFlicks of Colorado, a franchisee of a Utah-based company,
initiated the legal fight in August by suing Steven Soderbergh,
Steven Spielberg, Curtis Hanson and other prominent directors, asking
for a declaration that cleaning up their films didn't violate
copyright laws. The Directors Guild of America argued that studios
should be brought into the suit as the copyright holders.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than simply responding as defendants, the studios are
expected to mount an aggressive assault, probably seeking an
injunction to stop the sanitizers. The studios are required by the
federal court in Denver, where the suit was filed, to respond by
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Zavin, a lawyer with Loeb &amp; Loeb in New York, confirmed
that he expects to file papers by the deadline on behalf of the
Motion Picture Assn. of America member companies --
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc., AOL's Warner Bros., Sony Corp.'s
Columbia Pictures, Disney,  Vivendi Universal's Universal Studios,
Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Pictures and News Corp.'s 20th Century Fox
Film. DreamWorks also will join the filing, Zavin said.</TE>
<TE>   Zavin declined to discuss the substance of the filing, as did
representatives of the studios.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney David Schachter, who represents CleanFlicks, said studio
lawyers advised him at a conference two weeks ago to expect a
copyright infringement claim. Asked whether his client and similar
companies that are party to the suit had the resources to withstand a
studio legal assault, he said: "They are committed to the principle
of what they're doing here. This is not about money. This is about
what Hollywood's doing to our ears and our eyes."</TE>
<TE>   About a dozen film sanitizers, all relatively small operations,
have become involved in the legal fight, as has Robert Huntsman, an
Idaho copyright lawyer who joined CleanFlicks in filing the original
complaint after inventing a technology that hides film content
without actually altering it.</TE>
<TE>   Some operators, including CleanFlicks, rent videos from which
offending scenes have been edited. Others sell software that lets
consumers edit a DVD copy to their own specifications. CleanFlicks
has argued that it doesn't violate copyright laws because it buys a
new copy every time it edits a film.</TE>
<TE>   Directors Guild representatives declined to discuss the expected
studio filing. In the past, however, guild insiders have said they
anticipate a protracted legal fight that could wind up before the
U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   The directors appear to be strengthened by the studios' stand on
copyright law, with its extensive protections. Until the firms
decided to launch their offensive, the filmmakers had relied on the
Lanham Act, a federal statute that protects artists from association
with unauthorized versions of their work.</TE>
<TE>   The studios apparently became especially wary of any tangle over
the film-cleaning issue after Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) organized
a failed peacemaking session between the Directors Guild and a Utah
company called Trilogy Studios Inc. in March. Trilogy makes
consumer-operated editing software, and has since been named a
defendant in the guild's action.</TE>
<TE>   Hatch argued that Trilogy's approach creates a situation in which
"artistic expression and viewer choice both can flourish."</TE>
<TE>   Though reluctant to risk a fight with Congress, after the
embarrassment of Senate hearings on violence, the studios concluded
that to ignore alteration of their product might set a dangerous
precedent in a world rife with piracy and rocked by rapidly changing
technology.</TE>

<HD>EDS to Provide Services to BofA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bank of America Corp. said Thursday that it agreed to let Electronic
Data Systems Corp. provide computer services to the No. 3 U.S.
banking company in a 10-year deal worth $4.5 billion.</LD>
<LD>   News of deal sent EDS' shares up almost $1 to $19.80 in
after-hours trading, from a close of $18.88 on the New York Stock
Exchange, according to Instinet. Bank of America shares rose 4 cents
to $69.54 on the NYSE.</LD>
<LD>   Under the agreement, about 1,000 Bank of America staff across the
United States will become EDS employees.</LD>
<TE>   EDS will help Bank of America transform its voice and data network
systems to enable it to better serve customers, the companies said.
EDS will redesign and install Bank of America's optical network and
provide the company with customer help-desk services.</TE>
<TE>   The deal is the first multibillion-dollar contract EDS has won
since September, when it stunned Wall Street by saying its
third-quarter profit would fall short of estimates as spending on
computer services all but dried up.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the No. 2 consulting and services company after IBM
Corp. has lost a series of big deals, including contracts with J.P.
Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and the state of Texas. It also suffered the
termination of a Procter &amp; Gamble Co. deal.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the deal with Bank of America was good news in the
long term, but wondered if EDS -- which must spend millions of
dollars in cash to get big services contracts up and running -- would
be hurt in the short term.</TE>
<TE>   When EDS warned in September, it said its free cash flow for the
full-year 2002 would fall to $200 million to $400 million, down from
its previous forecast of $600 million to $800 million.</TE>
<TE>   EDS, with $614 million in cash on hand, said it is not purchasing
any of Bank of America's assets as part of the deal, but there is a
required capital outlay of $100 million in 2003. That already is
factored in to the company's $1-billion free cash-flow guidance for
next year, a spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's $100 million, then that is definitely a positive for EDS,
and this contract definitely looks to be better quality because of
the lower capital outlay," said Adam Frisch, an analyst with UBS
Warburg.</TE>
<TE>   The Bank of America deal was first disclosed Wednesday in a note
by Lehman Bros., sending EDS shares up more than 10%. The note said
such a deal that closed in the fourth quarter should easily allow EDS
to meet its fourth-quarter new-contract bookings estimate of $5
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Separately Wednesday, EDS said it was in exclusive talks to
provide technology services to Bank of Bermuda in a 12-year contract
worth $375 million.</TE>

<HD>Workers Sue FedEx, Allege Widespread Discrimination</HD>
<DH>California plaintiffs say minorities, women were denied
good jobs. Firm says claims lack merit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Girion</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twenty-six current and former California employees of FedEx Corp.
filed a lawsuit Thursday accusing the world's largest express shipper
of widespread discrimination against minorities and women.</LD>
<LD>   The suit alleges that the Memphis, Tenn.-based company relegates
most minorities to low-paying, casual and even dangerous jobs and
undermines their efforts to advance. When employees complain, FedEx
fails to take appropriate action and, in some cases, retaliates,
according to the suit. It also charges FedEx with falsifying time
cards and failing to pay overtime.</LD>
<LD>   A FedEx spokeswoman said the claims appear to be without merit.</LD>
<TE>   The 189-page suit was filed in state court in Oakland as a
proposed class action on behalf of FedEx employees in California.
Plaintiffs' lawyers said that if they develop evidence that the
alleged misconduct is more widespread, they may move the case to
federal court and seek to represent the company's minority employees
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Of FedEx's 117,000 U.S. employees, about 15,000 work in
California.</TE>
<TE>   FedEx's management is known in the Bay Area, where several of the
plaintiffs have worked, as the "ole boys network" and the "country
club," the suit says.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence shows FedEx treats its employees as if the civil
rights movement never happened," said Waukeen Q. McCoy, a San
Francisco lawyer representing the plaintiffs. "Our intention is to
send an unequivocal message to corporate America that discrimination
will not be tolerated ever."</TE>
<TE>   FedEx spokeswoman Traci Barnett said: "Many of the employees
involved enjoyed promotions and other opportunities, so that is
really inconsistent with their claims. FedEx will vigorously defend
the lawsuit. We take allegations of discrimination very seriously,
and we will not tolerate discrimination of any kind in the
workplace."</TE>
<TE>   Minorities constitute more than 40% of FedEx's workforce and
almost a third of all managers, she said. For the last few years,
Fortune magazine has listed FedEx among the 50 best companies for
minorities and among the 100 best companies to work for in America.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a number of highly effective procedures that have been
recognized nationally to address employees' concerns," Barnett said.</TE>
<TE>   But Michael Davis, another lawyer representing the plaintiffs,
said many workers avoid making complaints through the company's
computerized internal grievance system because it often forces them
to go to the supervisors they believe are causing their problems. "It
doesn't quite work the way FedEx says it does," Davis maintained.
"You file a complaint, and tomorrow your job is harder."</TE>
<TE>   Derrick Satchell, a former operations manager in San Jose, said he
was fired following 10 years of service after trying to blow the
whistle on alleged discrimination. "It was just swept under the rug,"
he said. "When we tried to make changes, we were stifled. They were
starting files on us that were not accurate. They were false and
caused us to be driven out."</TE>
<TE>   LaSonia Walker, a 10-year veteran of the company's Oakland hub,
blames discrimination for missed raises and lost promotions. She said
she joined the suit because internal complaints went nowhere. "We
have what you call purple blood," Walker said, referring to the
company's signature color. "We love the company. We weren't looking
to sue the company. I thought I'd be here another 10, 15 years and
retire. That's not going to happen now."</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs and their lawyers said they hoped the suit would
force the company to make changes, including the establishment of new
procedures for awarding promotions. Several plaintiffs kept diaries,
jotting down each incident of perceived discrimination the day it
happened, creating what one of the lawyers described as a damning
body of evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The FedEx case is the latest in a series of large-scale employment
discrimination suits against Fortune 500 companies. Eighteen months
ago, six California women filed a class-action lawsuit against
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., accusing the company of widespread sexual
discrimination. The suit, which is pending in federal court in San
Francisco, seeks to represent all female workers at Wal-Mart, the
nation's largest private employer.</TE>
<TE>   Several companies have settled similar employment discrimination
suits. Coca-Cola Co. set a record two years ago by settling a racial
discrimination case for $192.5 million, and Texaco Inc. agreed to pay
$176 million in 1996 to dispose of a similar case.</TE>

<HD>Ford Panel to Review IPO Claim</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co.'s board of directors has formed a committee to review
a shareholder claim that the automaker itself -- not just its
chairman -- should have had the chance to purchase shares in
brokerage Goldman Sachs' initial public offering in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The House Financial Services Committee disclosed in October that
Goldman allocated 400,000 shares of its IPO to William Clay Ford Jr.,
the great-grandson of the automaker's founder and now its chairman
and chief executive.</LD>
<LD>   In a Nov. 13 letter to the company, an attorney for shareholder
Roger Berger called for the board to investigate and recover
potential damages for not getting to invest in the shares at the same
time. The attorney, Robert Curry, said Ford would not have received
the allocation were it not for his position.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Goldman, which were offered at $53 a share on May 3,
1999, rose to a peak of $132 by September 2000. They closed Thursday
on the New York Stock Exchange at $74.23.</TE>
<TE>   Berger wants the executive's shares or the profit from their sale
-- which would now be about $8.4 million -- to be transferred to the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Vella, a spokesman for the automaker, did not say when the
board committee would complete its review.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas Van Praag has said the IPO
allocation was appropriate based on the more than 50 years that
Ford's family has used Goldman as a private investment manager.</TE>
<TE>   The automaker also has chosen Goldman for banking business that
has generated fees for the brokerage.</TE>
<TE>   In October, congressional investigators said Goldman Sachs offered
shares of IPOs to executives of at least 20 companies that had
steered lucrative business to the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman has denied any inappropriate actions.</TE>
<TE>   William Clay Ford Jr. on Thursday defended his investment in the
stock. In a message to employees, he said the purchase was "not
related in any way to company business."</TE>
<TE>   He was nonexecutive chairman of Ford at the time Goldman went
public. He became CEO in October 2001 after ousting Jacques Nasser.</TE>

<HD>Pact Allows Workers at Santa Monica Hotel to Unionize</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two and a half years after the national hotel workers union launched
an aggressive organizing campaign on the Santa Monica beachfront, its
first major target has agreed to lay down arms and allow workers to
sign union cards.</LD>
<LD>   The so-called neutrality pact announced Thursday by Loews Santa
Monica Beach Hotel was a watershed for the Hotel Employees and
Restaurant Employees union, whose organizers used street theater and
pressure from community and political allies in the face of strong
opposition from the hotel.</LD>
<LD>   "It shows that it can be done and ought to be done," said Kurt
Peterson, organizing director for HERE Local 11, who said the union
already is talking to workers at the nearby Doubletree and Sheraton
Four-Points hotels.</LD>
<TE>   "I hope the rest of the hotels in Santa Monica see there's a road
to fight and there's a road to work out a process that's fair....
We're going to end up there anyway, so why bother fighting?"</TE>
<TE>   John Thacker, general manager at Loews for the past year, said he
and the hotel's New York-based ownership group "concluded that it
would be in everybody's best interest to get some of this animosity
behind us and expedite the process of making a decision."</TE>
<TE>   The hotel, which has struggled with low occupancy rates for a year
and a half because of slumping tourism, lost some group bookings
because of the union campaign, Thacker said.</TE>
<TE>   In a memo to employees, Thacker and Peterson said, "the hotel and
the union have agreed to end our previous adversarial relationship
and replace it with one of mutual respect."</TE>
<TE>   The hotel agreed to "adopt a neutral and positive position" on
unionization and give organizers access to the employee cafeteria,
while the union promised "to end all marching, picketing and
demonstrations directed at the hotel."</TE>
<TE>   Employees will begin signing union cards in early January. If more
than 50% of the hotel's 200 nonmanagement workers sign cards, as is
expected, the hotel will recognize the union and begin contract
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   In an unusual concession, the hotel also agreed to allow an
arbitrator to set terms of a first contract if one is not reached
within six months.</TE>
<TE>   With funding from its national offices, the union local launched a
high-profile campaign in May 2000 to organize the Santa Monica beach
zone, which was mostly nonunion at the time. Since then, it has
revived a dormant union at the Fairmont-Miramar and organized workers
at the Viceroy hotel, formerly known as the Pacific Shores.</TE>
<TE>   But Loews was the main target. The campaign took on political
implications during the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los
Angeles when a key Democratic fund-raising group moved out of the
hotel to unionized quarters. Jonathan Tisch, chairman of the Loews
hotel chain, was a friend and major contributor to Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge milestone," Peterson said. "Now out of the nine major
hotels, two are union and one seems to be headed that way."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy," said hotel housekeeper Celia Talavera, an outspoken
union advocate since the campaign began. Talavera, who earns $10 an
hour, said she hoped a union contract would bring guaranteed
employment and lower health insurance costs.</TE>

<HD>Merrill to Reimburse Film Director $300,000</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said Thursday that it is "pleased" with an
arbitrator's decision that the securities firm won't have to
reimburse movie director Michael Bay for trading losses.</LD>
<LD>   A three-person arbitration panel last week told Merrill to pay the
director of "Pearl Harbor" $300,000, far less than the $8 million Bay
had sought.</LD>
<LD>   Bay filed an arbitration claim against Merrill last year and sued
a former Merrill stockbroker, Win H. Troung, for allegedly ignoring
his instructions not to trade on margin and conducting more than
8,000 trades over 15 months with the director's $2.8-million
portfolio of stocks, bonds and cash.</LD>
<TE>   The arbitration panel rejected "the vast majority" of Bay's
claims, including his allegations of fraud and excessive trading,
Merrill said. The $300,000 was reimbursement for commissions and
margin interest during a three-month period.</TE>
<TE>   "The panel found that Mr. Bay was a sophisticated investor who
determined the course of his investments," Merrill said.</TE>
<TE>   Carla Levenson, a spokeswoman for Bay's attorneys at law firm
O'Neill, Lysaght &amp; Sun, said Bay had been "vindicated" by the panel's
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co.'s "Pearl Harbor," released in 2001, cost about
$205 million to make and market, making it one of the most expensive
movies.</TE>
<TE>   Bay, 37, directed the 1998 action-adventure film "Armageddon,"
starring Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck. He also directed the 1996 film
"The Rock" starring Nicolas Cage.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based Merrill is the world's largest securities firm by
capital. Merrill is a passive, minority investor in Bloomberg, the
parent of Bloomberg News.</TE>

<HD>OPEC Agrees to Trim Production</HD>
<DH>The cartel's decision pushes crude oil prices to a
seven-week high in New York trading.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>OPEC on Thursday agreed to a cut in oil production to support prices
already buoyed by the threat of war in the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries also tried
to restore flagging market confidence in its discredited system of
quota limits by raising official output targets.</LD>
<LD>   The cartel, meeting here, voted to increase members' output quotas
by 1.3 million barrels a day while reducing overall production to the
level of the new quotas, Algerian Oil Minister Chakib Khelil said.</LD>
<TE>   Ministers said they were aiming for a drop in actual production in
the first half of next year, to avoid a potential plunge in prices
after winter heating demand ebbs in the Northern hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   The goal, they said, was to keep their benchmark oil price at $22
to $28 a barrel.</TE>
<TE>   "All [members] said very strongly they will comply," said Qatar's
oil minister, Abdullah al Attiyah.</TE>
<TE>   OPEC acknowledges that chronic quota busting had pushed recent
output well above its old supply target.</TE>
<TE>   The deal Thursday, covering the first quarter of 2003, raised the
daily target from 21.7 million barrels to 23 million. If members
comply, it would amount to a cut of more than 5% from estimated
production of 24.3 million barrels a day in November.</TE>
<TE>   "The mathematics make sense," said energy analyst Michael Rothman
of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. "They need to deal with the reduced call on
their oil after winter."</TE>
<TE>   The decision pushed crude oil prices to a seven-week high in New
York. Near-term futures rose 61 cents to $28.01 a barrel. The price
is up 41% this year, from $19.84 at the end of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But OPEC members say much of the price rise is tied to market
jitters about a Mideast war and, lately, to concerns about civil
strife in Venezuela, a major producer. The New York futures price is
down from a high of $30.83 in early October.</TE>
<TE>   The deal could mean trouble for world economies struggling to
reignite growth, some analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The world economy is bumping along the bottom, and OPEC is
looking at its own domestic finances," said Raad Alkadiri of
Petroleum Finance Corp. in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The decision met with some skepticism because observers wonder how
far OPEC producers will go to turn down the taps and abide by new
quotas.</TE>
<TE>   "Saudi Arabia is the architect of this deal and clearly will cut,
but will they get the others to comply?" said consultant Gary Ross of
PIRA Energy in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Higher oil prices have encouraged rival nations to invest in new
fields, taking market share from OPEC. Non-OPEC countries next year
may increase output by 1.3 million barrels a day, the International
Energy Agency estimates, outstripping growth in demand and leaving no
room for additional OPEC oil.</TE>
<TE>   OPEC supplies about one-third of the world's oil.</TE>

<HD>Ruling Backs SBC's California Service Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James S. Granelli</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SBC Communications Inc. won preliminary approval Thursday to offer
long-distance phone service to California residents and businesses,
pending final approval from the state Public Utilities Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by an administrative law judge sets up several
safeguards to ensure that SBC California, formerly known as Pacific
Bell, doesn't use its monopoly power as the state's main
local-service carrier to lock out competition.</LD>
<LD>   The 31-page ruling by Judge Jacqueline A. Reed is aimed at
resolving issues raised by the PUC in mid-September. At that time,
the agency gave SBC lukewarm endorsement to sell long-distance
service in California, which at $10.5 billion is the nation's biggest
telecommunications market.</LD>
<TE>   The agency said it was still concerned about SBC's ability to
leverage its power over competitors and keep consumer prices
artificially high.</TE>
<TE>   SBC covers about 78% of the state, including Los Angeles, and
controls 90% of the access lines in that area.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very encouraged by the judge's ruling," said SBC spokesman
John Britton. The company is awaiting final U.S. approval, expected
Dec. 19, from the Federal Communications Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Competitors such as AT&amp;T Corp. and WorldCom Inc. will have until
Dec. 24 to file comments, and the commission is expected to rule
shortly after that, said H. Gordon Diamond, an AT&amp;T spokesman. But he
wouldn't comment on the ruling because it was released late in the
day and executives had not had a chance to review it.</TE>
<TE>   Independent analyst Jeff Kagan in Atlanta hailed the preliminary
decision as a "home run for SBC" and good for competition in the
state.</TE>
<TE>   MCI and AT&amp;T are winning millions of customers away from the Baby
Bells nationwide. "It's a real battle for the customer," he said. "So
it's important to take the shackles off and let market conditions
take over."</TE>
<TE>   The PUC's September decision created a confusing situation in
which SBC might have been allowed to offer state-to-state
long-distance service but not intrastate.</TE>
<TE>   So in theory customers might have had to use two long-distance
carriers: one to call between, say, Los Angeles and New York and
another to call between Los Angeles and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The reason: Carriers must satisfy regulatory checklists at both
the state and the federal level. The PUC held in September that SBC
had met the federal requirements but not the state rules.</TE>
<TE>   SBC countered that all it needed was the blessing of the FCC,
setting the stage for a protracted fight all parties wanted to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   Reed rejected continuing delays in approving SBC's application,
saying, "The better approach is to erect competitive protective
measures so that illegal conduct is prevented, revealed and
punished."</TE>
<TE>   Such safeguards as PUC staff reviews of SBC marketing efforts will
help ensure that SBC's local service operations aren't illegally
subsidizing its long-distance efforts or vice versa, she said.</TE>

<HD>West Coast Dockworkers Caucus Endorses Contract</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Representatives of all dockworker union locals on the West Coast
approved Thursday a tentative six-year labor contract, sending the
pact to the general membership for a final vote.</LD>
<LD>   The contract between the International Longshore and Warehouse
Union and the shipping industry's Pacific Maritime Assn. was hammered
out after six months of bitter negotiations punctuated by work
slowdowns and a 10-day employer lockout. The union's 10,500
dockworkers now will cast ballots, with results expected by Jan. 24.</LD>
<LD>   The contract contains significant concessions from the union on
technology, allowing information to flow into terminals via computers
and scanners rather than being retyped by union clerks.</LD>
<TE>   Those changes are expected to eliminate at least 400 well-paying
marine clerk jobs.</TE>
<TE>   In turn, union members won large pension increases, maintained
free health insurance benefits and won jurisdiction over some
nonunion planning jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives from all locals on the West Coast spent the last
week in San Francisco reviewing the agreement. In announcing their
vote Thursday, union President James Spinosa said, "The caucus
recognized that this is truly a historic contract and we are urging
all ILWU members to vote for ratification."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Viacom Inc., parent of the CBS television network and Paramount
Pictures, has threatened to stop all high-definition TV broadcasts on
CBS unless federal regulators mandate certain anti-piracy
technologies by this summer.</LD>
<LD>   CBS is the leading source of free, over-the-air HDTV, transmitting
most of its prime-time programs and many sports broadcasts in the
format for the last four seasons.</LD>
<LD>   In comments filed Dec. 6, Viacom told the Federal Communications
Commission that it would transmit no HDTV in the 2003-04 season
unless the commission mandated "broadcast flag" technology to deter
digital TV broadcasts from being retransmitted over the Internet.</LD>
<TE>   Viacom warned the FCC that without protections for free
over-the-air broadcasts, HDTV programs would shift to more secure
cable and satellite services. Some Viacom programs already are
heading in that direction: On Wednesday, HDNet of Dallas announced a
deal to rebroadcast several defunct TV series from Paramount in HDTV
on cable and satellite.</TE>
<TE>   A variety of programmers, TV manufacturers and high-tech companies
have backed the concept of a broadcast flag, which would require
future TVs, computers and other digital devices to block digital TV
shows from moving onto the Internet. But the proposal has drawn sharp
criticism from some technology companies and consumer advocates, who
warn that it would hamstring innovation to guard against a
nonexistent threat.</TE>

<LD>   As part of the settlement, Culpepper will continue to endorse,
wear and use Nike products throughout the National Football League
season. Further terms were not released.</LD>
<LD>   Nike filed the lawsuit in June to contest Culpepper's signing an
endorsement contract with rival Reebok International Ltd. Culpepper
was planning to sign a long-term contract and appear in a television
commercial for Reebok, but Nike exercised its right of first refusal
and matched Reebok's offer to Culpepper.</LD>
<TE>   Culpepper did not think Nike's offer matched Reebok's, leading to
the dispute.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two U.S. satellite companies could be on the verge of a bidding war
for a leading European rival. Both planned to submit takeover offers
worth about $3 billion by today, a source close to the negotiations
said.</LD>
<LD>   The takeover target is Paris-based Eutelsat, which broadcasts more
than 1,000 television channels around the world.</LD>
<LD>   The first potential suitor to step forward this week was
Washington-based Intelsat Ltd., which said it wanted to complement
its strengths in data transmission.</LD>
<TE>   Several published reports have said PanAmSat Corp., based in
Wilton, Conn., would make an offer for Eutelsat. PanAmSat Chief
Executive Joseph Wright said Thursday that his company would meet the
bid deadline Eutelsat set for today.</TE>
<TE>   A source close to the negotiations said PanAmSat was trying to
assemble a European consortium, while Intelsat wanted a
straightforward acquisition.</TE>

<HD>SEC Enforcement Chief Urges Action Against Auditors' Firms</HD>
<DH>He says agency needs to shift approach and hold companies
responsible for their partners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marcy Gordon</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission, while continuing to prosecute
individual auditors who abet corporate fraud, also should take action
against accounting firms themselves, the agency's top enforcement
official told the besieged industry on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC needs to shift its approach and hold accounting firms
responsible for audit failures by their partners -- even when the
firms' senior managers weren't involved, SEC Enforcement Director
Stephen Cutler said in a speech to the industry's trade and lobbying
group.</LD>
<LD>   That raises the possibility of new SEC civil lawsuits against
accounting firms in cases of companies that mislead investors with
inaccurate financial results.</LD>
<TE>   "You can count on your fingers the number of times that the [SEC]
has sued" a major accounting firm in the last quarter century for an
audit failure caused by its partners, even though the agency has the
legal authority to do so, Cutler said.</TE>
<TE>   It's time for the agency to "recalibrate its enforcement approach
when it comes to audit firms," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some may argue, he acknowledged, that it is unreasonable to expect
a big accounting firm to control thousands of employees engaging in
audits of companies around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   "But why should an accounting firm be allowed to routinely
disassociate itself from the actions of its partners?" Cutler asked.</TE>
<TE>   Cutler's shot across the bow targeted an industry shaken by a year
of accounting scandals at major U.S. firms and the criminal
conviction of accounting giant Arthur Andersen for destroying audit
documents of Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with the prospect of SEC enforcement actions, Cutler said,
"It is my hope that accounting firms will take an even greater role
in ensuring that individual auditors are properly discharging their
special and critical gate-keeping role."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Cutler told the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants that the SEC will continue to aggressively pursue
misconduct by individual auditors.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I can safely say that you should expect more of the same
in the near future," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't clear whether President Bush's nominee to chair the SEC,
investment banker William H. Donaldson, would embrace Cutler's
proposal.</TE>

<HD>United May Revive West Coast Shuttle</HD>
<DH>Company plans to launch a low-fare carrier next year to
compete against discount rivals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>United Airlines parent UAL Corp. hopes to use its bankruptcy
proceedings to form a subsidiary discount airline -- perhaps on the
West Coast -- to better compete against low-fare rivals, UAL's chief
executive said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Details of the new service are still being developed and are
subject to negotiation with United's unions. But the company plans to
launch the new airline sometime next year, UAL Chairman and CEO Glenn
Tilton told reporters at Washington Dulles International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   "The low-cost-carrier phenomenon is drawing customers away from
the main lines" such as United, Tilton said. "We need to take
advantage of that."</LD>
<TE>   Tilton noted United's former West Coast shuttle as an earlier
attempt to challenge Southwest Airlines Inc. and other low-cost
competitors. A United spokesman, Chris Brathwaite, said that "doesn't
mean the shuttle itself is coming back," but he said the new discount
carrier might start on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   If launched, United's new airline would heighten competition for
passengers flying within the West. The market is dominated by
Southwest, which has more than 60% of intra-California passenger
traffic, analysts estimate. Smaller low-fare airlines such as JetBlue
Airways Corp. also have boosted service in the West at the expense of
United and other network carriers.</TE>
<TE>   Even as cash-strapped United filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection Monday, Tilton said California would remain a priority at
the airline, which is based in Elk Grove Township, Ill. United has
the biggest market share at the Los Angeles and San Francisco
airports, and more than a quarter of United's nearly 1,800 daily
flights originate in the state.</TE>
<TE>   If United chooses to launch its new low-cost service in the West,
it would be "a way to reinforce their two California hubs and to stem
the tide of incursion by the low-cost carriers," said Michael Allen,
chief operating officer of the consulting firm Back Aviation
Solutions.</TE>
<TE>   But rolling out a new airline won't be easy. United already faces
tough negotiations with its unions and creditors to develop a
bankruptcy reorganization plan that will hinge on massive
cost-cutting. Creating a new airline within United will complicate
the task, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Several major airlines have tried over the years to fight
Southwest with low-fare subsidiaries, with limited success. Now the
effort has renewed urgency. Amid the weak economy and slump in
travel, passengers are demanding cheaper fares that the major
airlines can't profitably match. They're suffering massive losses as
a result.</TE>
<TE>   Delta Air Lines Inc., for instance, last month unveiled plans for
its own low-cost "airline within an airline" that will concentrate on
East Coast markets.</TE>
<TE>   But Ron Kuhlmann, an analyst with Unisys R2A Consultants,
questioned why United, Delta and others are limiting their lower-cost
services to certain regions. "The solution needs to be companywide,"
he said. "If you make money on one little chunk of business, but lose
money everywhere else, you're not solving the problem."</TE>
<TE>   The original "Shuttle by United" began in 1994 and had a mixed
record until it was abandoned a month after the terrorist attacks in
2001, when United and nearly all airlines slashed their operations.
At the time, the shuttle had 468 flights around the West. Although
United kept serving many of the same cities as the shuttle, the
shuttle's brand was dropped and its frequency of flights was reduced.</TE>
<TE>   United never broke out the shuttle's performance figures. But the
shuttle did get credit for boosting United's passengers within
California.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, United also dropped a $100 fee it planned to start
charging next month for customers flying on standby. Several airlines
announced similar fees in September, which angered many travelers.
Analysts predicted other airlines would match United's rollback.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Corporate Offices Raided</HD>
<DH>French authorities also search the homes of ex-CEO Messier
in probe of accounting practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>French authorities searched Vivendi Universal's corporate
headquarters in Paris and the homes of former Chief Executive
Jean-Marie Messier on Thursday as the criminal investigation of the
company's accounting practices deepened.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second time in recent months that investigators raided
the headquarters, and authorities would not comment on what they were
looking for. Vivendi confirmed that a team of criminal investigators
was "carrying out inquiries at the company's head office," and said
it was cooperating fully.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation by the Paris prosecutor stems from a July 18
complaint filed by a group of French shareholders who claim that
under Messier, Vivendi published "false accounts" for 2000 and 2001
and gave misleading outlooks for 2002. They allege that Messier was
attempting to conceal the company's financial crisis from investors
and blame him for a sharp downturn in the stock.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi's share price had plummeted 70% before Messier was ousted
in a boardroom coup this summer. The new management said the company
nearly was forced to file for bankruptcy protection from heavy debts
piled on after Messier led a three-year acquisition binge, which
included buying Hollywood icons Universal Studios and Universal Music
Group.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to distance itself from the actions of Messier and other
former executives, Vivendi stressed Thursday that it is also a
"plaintiff claiming damages" in the case.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation comes on top of others by the U.S. attorney's
office for the Southern District of New York; the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which upgraded its inquiry to a full-blown
investigation last month; and French stock market regulators, who
raided Vivendi's headquarters this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Sources say the inquiries focus on what Messier and other former
officers knew about the company's liquidity crisis, when they knew it
and what they conveyed to shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear what documents authorities were searching for in the
latest raid, but a source familiar with the matter said they probably
include many of the same records seized by France's stock market
regulator, such as key notes and e-mails between Messier and
Vivendi's former chief financial officer, Guillaume Hannezo.</TE>
<TE>   French authorities also are eager to examine an auditor's report
that Vivendi commissioned shortly after Messier's ouster, said
Frederik Carnoy, who represents the group of 4,000 shareholders
behind the complaint. Vivendi has said the report found no evidence
of any improper accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Carnoy said the prosecutor's office also is investigating claims
made in his lawsuit that there were irregularities in the company's
financial accounts for 2001, including dozens of pages that Carnoy
alleges appear to have been substituted in an annual report filed
with the French commercial court.</TE>
<TE>   "What we want to know is, have they concealed information? Are
they hiding anything?" Carnoy said in an interview Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to searching Vivendi's corporate offices, the police
on Thursday searched Messier's flat in central Paris, as well as a
house outside the city.</TE>
<TE>   Messier reportedly canceled plans to meet with the Anglo-American
Press Assn. in Paris Thursday evening.</TE>
<TE>   Messier, who has denied any wrongdoing, could not be reached for
comment. In an interview last month, his attorney, Olivier Metzner,
accused French authorities of being on an apparent "fishing
expedition," and said their investigations will show that the
accusations made against Messier were ill-founded.</TE>
<TE>   Police also were searching homes of other former Vivendi
executives, including former chief operating officer Eric Licoys, a
source said. Licoys could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Company sources downplayed Thursday's searches, saying they were
standard procedure in any such investigation in France. Investor
reaction was muted, with Vivendi shares falling 19 cents to $16.10 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Yes, the Turks Are Good Enough for Europe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Soner Cagaptay</AU>
<BD>Soner Cagaptay is coordinator of the Turkish research
program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of the 13 candidate countries waiting to enter the European Union, 12
-- including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Malta -- are expected to
be promised membership at today's meeting in Copenhagen.</LD>
<LD>   Only Turkey is likely to be left out. Ankara has been told that
its human rights record does not meet European standards and that
Turkey needs to improve its democracy. If Turkey does its assigned
homework, then the EU might take another look in the future.</LD>
<LD>   Turkey might not have a stellar democracy or a perfect record on
human rights, but is it less qualified than, say, Latvia, one of the
fortunate 12? As of December 2001, half a million Latvians (one-fifth
of the tiny Baltic country's population) still lacked citizenship
because they speak Russian. This means they cannot get passports and
so cannot travel out of the country, nor can they vote. An official
report by the Strasbourg-based Council of Europe cites "asphyxiation
using a plastic bag and strangulation by a guitar wire" as being
among measures used by the Latvian security forces.</LD>
<TE>   This does not mean that Latvia should be excluded, because joining
Europe will help it mature democratically. Experience shows that EU
accession has helped countries such as Greece and Portugal move
toward democratic consolidation. Yet the EU glass is half full when
it comes to some candidates but half empty when it comes to Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   Another argument holds that Turkey is not part of Europe
geographically. Yet Cyprus is expected to get membership. An island
traditionally considered to be part of the Middle East, Cyprus is 65
miles from Syria but, at the shortest distance, 500 miles from the
European continent.</TE>
<TE>   So what is the EU's real problem with Turkey? Turkey is simply too
big a bite for the old Continent to digest. Although not poorer than
most other candidates, Turkey, with its 72 million mostly low-income
inhabitants, does present a challenge. So far, the EU has provided
its poorer members development cash from wealthier Northern Europe.
But European economies have been in a slow-growth mode for almost a
decade. Absorbing 12 mostly poor new members with more than 100
million inhabitants is a large enough test for the EU.</TE>
<TE>   Europe has to be honest about its economic impotency with regard
to accepting Turkey. Denials of this reality and the use of
unconvincing arguments as a cover-up will be perceived as expressions
of old prejudices against Islam. That could send a wrong message to
those Muslims who believe in the EU ideals of open and democratic
societies and rule of law. This is especially true for European
Muslims, the fastest-growing religious community on the Continent.</TE>
<TE>   The EU must be frank toward Turkey and give the Turks a firm date
for membership, even if it takes a decade of negotiations. With its
shrinking demography and stagnant economy, the European Union would
benefit from Turkey's young and Western-oriented population, as well
as its dynamic economy: Turkey has averaged an annual growth rate of
4.5% over the last two decades, compared with barely over 1% for the
EU as a whole. And tying a predominantly Muslim yet secular and
democratic nation to the Continent is in the EU's best interests.
Telling the Turks they are not good enough for Europe is not.</TE>

<HD>A Balanced Budget Takes Backbone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Ross</AU>
<BD>Jean Ross is the executive director of the California
Budget Project, a Sacramento-based nonprofit policy group. Web site:
www.cbp.org.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California faces a crisis of unprecedented magnitude, with estimates
of a budget shortfall as high as $30 billion, equivalent to one-third
of this year's total state spending. But to balance the budget solely
through spending cuts, as some have proposed, would require virtually
shutting down state government -- and that would still not be enough.</LD>
<LD>   California's crisis, like those of some other states, stems
primarily from two factors. First, California's tax revenues have
dropped precipitously because of the downturn in the economy and, in
particular, the slump in the stock market and accompanying drop in
investment- related income. The state expects to collect $37 billion
in personal income taxes this year, compared with $45 billion just
two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Second, though spending increased when the economic boom filled
state tax coffers during the late 1990s, lawmakers enacted
substantial tax cuts. The tax cuts of the last decade will reduce
this year's state tax collections by more than $7 billion. Pointing
to spending increases during the boom of the late 1990s, some
Republican lawmakers have suggested that the budget can be balanced
solely by reducing spending. However, these same individuals refuse
to identify what and how much ought to be cut.</LD>
<TE>   That may be because most of the increases went to programs and
priorities that voters value most. New spending included increasing
aid to local school districts for efforts such as class size
reduction; expanding financial aid programs to bring a college
education within the reach of every graduating high school senior;
and extending affordable health coverage to children in low-income
working families.</TE>
<TE>   Balancing the budget with only spending cuts, however, is a
mathematical impossibility, short of eviscerating the basic functions
of state and local governments.</TE>
<TE>   For example, shutting down the state prison system along with the
other state departments and agencies, as well as eliminating the
University of California and State University system, would save far
less than the projected spending gap. Put another way, the gap is
larger than the total amount the state spends on health and social
service programs.</TE>
<TE>   How should the budget be balanced? In 1991, when faced with a
crisis of similar magnitude, then-Gov. Pete Wilson made the
politically courageous decision to bridge half of the deficit through
spending reductions and half through tax increases. The current
crisis calls for similar courage.</TE>
<TE>   Proposals released earlier this month by Gov. Gray Davis address
less than half the gap and would take a deep toll on families and
cripple the gains made by the public schools. The proposed
$1.5-billion cut in funds for K-2 education translates into a
reduction of roughly $257 per student, dropping the state's standing
in the national rankings from 29th to 37th. Another proposal would
deny health coverage to 293,000 working parents with incomes below
the poverty level. Still another would eliminate child-care
assistance for up to 55,000 children whose parents have successfully
moved from welfare to work. Some of these families would undoubtedly
be forced back onto the welfare rolls.</TE>
<TE>   Options for raising revenue include reinstating higher tax rates
on the highest-earning taxpayers, a choice made by former Govs.
Wilson and Ronald Reagan when faced with daunting spending gaps;
modernizing the state's sales tax to capture the rising share of
economic activity in the service sector and through Internet and mail
order sales; and removing the preferential tax treatment enjoyed by
long-term business property owners compared with new businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Misguided policy choices run the risk of permanently damaging the
elements of communities -- from education to health care to
infrastructure -- that are basic to a healthy economy and a decent
standard of living. Policymakers should adopt a balanced solution to
the crisis: prudent spending coupled with revenue increases to ensure
continued investment in quality public services.</TE>

<HD>What We Need Is a Fear Vaccine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Shermer</AU>
<BD>Michael Shermer is the editor of Skeptic magazine, a
monthly columnist for Scientific American and the author of "Why
People Believe Weird Things" (Henry Holt, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush plans to announce today the government's program to
implement a smallpox vaccination program within weeks, starting with
half a million military personnel and another half a million
health-care and emergency workers, then expanding the program in
early 2004 to offer immunization to the entire American public.</LD>
<LD>   Officials estimate that at least 10 million doses will need to be
created just to handle all public and private health, medical,
police, fire and other emergency personnel. Millions more doses would
have to be created if a majority of the public volunteered for the
program.</LD>
<LD>   Hold on just a moment. When was all of this decided? Did I miss
the public debate after being abducted by aliens? Smallpox was
eradicated by 1980. What's going on here?</LD>
<TE>   Terrorism, that's what. Or, more precisely, the fear of terrorism.
That fear, in fact, has been in the driver's seat since 9/11. A
single shoe-bomb incident means we now all get to disrobe our feet in
front of airport strangers.</TE>
<TE>   Smallpox, it seems, would make a horrific weapon of mass
destruction for terrorists. Between 1880 and 1980, it killed about
half a billion people -- more than all the deaths in the two world
wars combined.</TE>
<TE>   So, yes, smallpox could be employed by Iraqi or Al Qaeda
operatives against Americans. Then again, they could also use
anthrax, or half a dozen other biological weapons. They could go with
chemical weapons, even nuclear weapons. Heck, fertilizer in a cargo
truck is pretty effective at razing a building.</TE>
<TE>   How did our government decide which of the literally dozens of
potential terrorist weapons should be targeted for protection? Given
limited time and resources, are we really sure this is the most
likely weapon to be used against us?</TE>
<TE>   We must bear in mind that the vaccination process is not without
some risk.</TE>
<TE>   The smallpox vaccine is made from its weak biological cousin,
cowpox. When you are vaccinated with the weaker virus, your body
develops an immunity to the stronger smallpox virus. So, in essence,
you are purposefully making yourself slightly sick so that you do not
later become deadly sick.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the system is not foolproof.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates of the number of people who would become ill or die from
the vaccination vary. According to the Centers for Disease Control,
74 people would suffer serious complications and one would die for
every 1 million vaccinations given. Of the 130 million Americans
never vaccinated, about 2,000 would face life-threatening
complications, and between 125 and 250 would die. For the 158 million
Americans who may need revaccination, about 800 would face the threat
of dying, with about 40 succumbing.</TE>
<TE>   These are not trivial casualty statistics -- although when
compared to the roughly 30% death rate of a smallpox epidemic,
vaccination may seem well worth the risk.</TE>
<TE>   What we do not know -- or, at least, we have not been given the
data by our government -- is the degree of likelihood that terrorists
would or could use smallpox as a weapon.</TE>
<TE>   When told by experts and government authorities that we are
supposed to fear something, the natural human reaction is to believe
them. But what is worrisome is what we are not being told to fear, or
that we are being told to fear the wrong thing.</TE>
<TE>   This is not a new problem. In 5 BC, the citizens of the Sicilian
city of Camarina were told by their leaders that they were being
threatened by a pestilence festering in a nearby marsh. The city
officials carried out plans to drain the marsh and rid the public of
the newly discovered fear. The plague epidemic never hit, and the
citizens were grateful. Except now their enemies, the Syracusans, who
lived on the other side of the protective marsh, could waltz across
the drained land and conquer the Camarinas -- which they promptly
did.</TE>
<TE>   Until we think through more carefully which threats are real and
which are not, skepticism of the government's program is a healthy
response.</TE>
<TE>   Don't drain the marsh until we know this is the best course of
action.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Can Still Head Off a Nuclear N. Korea</HD>

<LD>In the wake of its aborted seizure of a North Korean vessel carrying
Scud missiles to Yemen, the Bush administration is now confronting a
serious crisis on the Korean peninsula. Thursday, Pyongyang announced
that it would take steps -- including restarting operation of a small
nuclear reactor -- to end the freeze on its nuclear weapons program
put in place by a 1994 accord with the United States. By restarting
the reactor, which can produce nuclear bomb-making material, North
Korea has fired a clear warning shot across Washington's bow.</LD>
<LD>   The revelation in October that Pyongyang had been conducting a
secret program, based on uranium enrichment to produce nuclear
weapons, has provoked a slow-motion confrontation with the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   But that program pales in comparison with Pyongyang's more
extensive facilities for the production of plutonium, another
material for building nuclear weapons. If those facilities, which
have not been operating as a result of the 1994 agreement, were
unfrozen, the North could build a large stockpile of weapons.
Restarting the small reactor may be a step in that direction.</LD>
<TE>   Thursday's action significantly escalates the crisis, but it was
also calculated. Restarting the reactor makes perfect sense in
response to the recent suspension of heavy fuel oil deliveries to
North Korea after the discovery of its secret program. As part of the
negotiations leading up to the 1994 accord, Washington agreed to
provide Pyongyang with heavy fuel oil if it stopped operation of that
reactor.</TE>
<TE>   Pyongyang knows full well that its latest move will not provoke an
immediate confrontation. The significance of restarting the reactor
is that bomb- making plutonium will accumulate in the fuel rods
inside the reactor over time. Then those rods will have to be
unloaded and undergo "reprocessing." That will take months.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, if Pyongyang has removed the seals from all its
nuclear facilities and begun to reprocess the fuel rods it already
has in storage, as some reports seem to indicate, the situation is
far more serious. In that case, the U.S. and its allies would have to
face the unpalatable choice of launching a preemptive strike against
the nuclear facilities or acquiesce to Pyongyang building a growing
arsenal of nuclear weapons. This would undermine the nonproliferation
regime and provoke serious new tensions in Northeast Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Pyongyang's most recent move is designed to take advantage of the
Bush administration's preoccupation with Iraq. The North probably
calculates that its chances of coming out on top in any confrontation
with the U.S. will be better if Washington's military and diplomatic
resources are tied up in the Mideast.</TE>
<TE>   What are Pyongyang's objectives in provoking this confrontation?
The North Koreans are making the best of a bad situation. Caught
red-handed violating the 1994 agreement, they are now trying to make
a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Coupled with Pyongyang's threatening
pronouncements has been a constant drumbeat that it wants to
negotiate with Washington.</TE>
<TE>   We should make no mistake: Without a solution to the current
crisis, North Korea is going nuclear. Many in Pyongyang look to
emulate India and Pakistan, recent nuclear weapons states. They may
see this crisis as their last chance.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever Pyongyang's motivations, the Bush administration now must
face the prospect of a serious confrontation. Since the October
revelation, Washington has stitched together an ineffective response
based on the hope that the North will back down.</TE>
<TE>   In part, the administration has been hampered by its own moral
repulsion to dealing with North Korea. In part, close allies have
hampered it, particularly South Korea, which wants to solve the
crisis through diplomacy. The U.S. also has been hampered by its own
wishful thinking that any crisis will take months, if not years, to
play out.</TE>
<TE>   However, the pace of events may not be Washington's to determine.
North Korea has made that quite clear.</TE>
<TE>   Coping effectively will require using all the arrows in the
administration's quiver. Tough measures -- such as seeking
international sanctions or reinforcing American military forces on
the peninsula -- have a definite role. But so does diplomacy, by
using negotiations to make tough demands on the North. If Pyongyang
refuses, the U.S. will be in a better position to secure
international support to enforce those demands.</TE>
<TE>   If Washington exercises responsible leadership, that will only
redound in its favor. If not, the results could be catastrophic,
triggering a downward spiral of serious tensions and forcing the U.S.
and its allies to the brink of war.</TE>

<LD>Read This Editorial and Lose Lots of Weight Fast. You'll be amazed at
how effortlessly you shed pounds of fat with absolutely no effort
whatsoever. Guaranteed. Easy as, well, pie. In fact, munch pork rinds
while reading this and you'll be slimmer, trimmer and more attractive
overnight. *</LD>
<LD>   There is, of course, no evidence whatsoever to connect weight loss
and reading. However belatedly, the Federal Trade Commission is
finally moving against such bogus diet claims. Many in the expanding
ranks of expanding Americans seem oblivious to good sense when it
comes to good health. People so full of skepticism and cynicism about
government or politics eagerly obey the blather of some has-been
radio personality and plunk down good money to consume all manner of
powders and pills in the hopeful expectation of buying less
corpulence and more health.</LD>
<TE>   Which is why it's encouraging that at last the FTC and two states
-- albeit not California -- moved in court recently to stop the
misleading ads of one prominent diet marketer. Of course, there is in
these commercial charades plenty of responsibility to go around.
Consumers could become more attentive and knowledgeable on health
issues and less gullible about health claims. And the FTC should be
promptly vigilant. The agency took three years to investigate bogus
advertising that reaped $190 million in sales for the potions in
question, called Body Solutions.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, commercial deception is not new to the human
experience. It's unlikely that even the most informed pigeon innards
could help the Oracle of Delphi predict the future. But that hasn't
stopped people from believing.</TE>
<TE>   The FTC, Texas and Illinois have sued Mark Nutritionals for "false
and unsubstantiated" claims that its Body Solutions Evening Weight
Loss Formula produces weight loss overnight with no diet or exercise.
About time. Yes, Americans are overweight, especially in December.
Indeed, obesity is a serious health issue. But that grants no license
to prey on Americans' predilection for self-improvement.</TE>
<TE>   While denying lawbreaking, the company, now in bankruptcy,
announced it would develop "a new way" to advertise its products.
Swell. Maybe part of the ad research should be to require executives
to wash down daily doses of pizza, doughnuts and chips with, say, a
gallon or so of Body Solutions. See what they lose then.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   * Individual weight-loss experience will vary according to actual
food consumption, exercise patterns and reading speed. Actual results
not guaranteed. Void where prohibited by common sense.</TE>

<HD>Step Down, Mr. Kissinger</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Henry Kissinger is tying up the independent 9/11 commission in
needless controversy. With the backing of the White House, he is
refusing to divulge his client list despite the potential conflict of
interest inherent in leading a top-secret government panel and, at
the same time, advising multinational companies. Former Sen. George
J. Mitchell has resigned from the panel because he can't devote
enough time to it; Kissinger should do so because he is bringing
discredit upon it.</LD>
<LD>   Kissinger's financial dealings have always been controversial
because he broke new ground in cashing in on his name and influence,
earning millions and guarding the names of his clients like state
secrets. His clients have a big interest in American foreign policy
and reportedly include Exxon Mobil, Arco and American Express.</LD>
<LD>   Kissinger has always been eager to advise presidents as a private
citizen; however, the question of where his recommendations and the
interests of his clients diverged has been ambiguous. In leading a
government panel on how well government performed before and after
9/11, he has a duty to put himself beyond the suspicion of using
government service to further any personal interests.</LD>
<TE>   Kissinger and the White House pooh-pooh the notion that there's a
problem. The argument is that because he is President Bush's
appointee and unpaid, he has no obligation to make a full disclosure.
But the Congressional Research Service has concluded that Kissinger
and other members of the commission must name clients who paid over
$5,000 in the last two years. Furthermore, the Senate Ethics
Committee is sending its objections to the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Given that Vice President Dick Cheney has explicitly stated that
he wants to increase executive branch immunity to congressional
oversight instituted after Watergate, it is hard to avoid the
conclusion that the White House's blanket defense of Kissinger is
part of a broader pattern. This is simply the latest administration
action that suggests it isn't eager to have a no-holds-barred
investigation, which it resisted until pressure from Congress and the
9/11 victim's families became overwhelming. Indeed, if full
disclosure about 9/11 is what the commission seeks, why is the man in
charge someone who championed the secret bombing campaign in Cambodia
during the Vietnam War?</TE>
<TE>   The commission is supposed to shed light on what went wrong in
government, which is why Kissinger was the wrong man for the job from
the beginning. The Bush administration should be more concerned with
discovering the causes and consequences of 9/11 than in protecting
Kissinger.</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger keeps giving the public new reasons for why he's
unsuitable for this task. He should go, either at the president's
request or through his own reasoned conclusion that he is not doing
the commission or his reputation any good.</TE>

<HD>Water Deal Must Be Made</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has come to this: A one-vote majority of an obscure elected body
in a remote desert county of 140,000 residents has put the water
future of 17 million Southern Californians in jeopardy.</LD>
<LD>   Because its farmers got there first, the Imperial Irrigation
District is legally entitled to 71% of California's share of the
Colorado River to irrigate its 400,000 acres of cropland. After years
of negotiation, the district this week rejected, 3 to 2, a proposed
long-term deal to sell some of its water to San Diego in return for
handsome payments to willing farmers. The water sale was part of a
complex exchange to avoid an abrupt cutoff of Colorado River sales to
the region's cities, which have been using spare allotments of river
water.</LD>
<LD>   The states that have legal rights to that river water are
suffering droughts and want it back. Without it, however, Southern
California could suffer severe water-use limits and economic damage.
The farm transfer, combined with new water conservation by farmers,
would keep the water flowing.</LD>
<TE>   There are many reasons the transfer was rejected, but the deal
breaker may have been the Owens Valley syndrome. Farmers whose family
roots in the rich irrigated soil go back 100 years feared that once
the cities got some of their water, they would keep coming back for
more. But it's not Owens Valley, where the city of Los Angeles
secretly bought up land for its water rights a century ago and took
the water south.</TE>
<TE>   Imperial approached San Diego first, in 1995, because it was under
state orders to conserve more water. The idea was that San Diego
would pay Imperial to install water-saving facilities in the fields
and San Diego would get the saved water, up to 200,000 acre-feet a
year, enough to serve half a million average households. In the final
package, Imperial would get several billion dollars over 75 years. No
farmer could be forced to sell water or fallow land.</TE>
<TE>   The plan might have passed if the farmers ran the irrigation
district. In Imperial County, unlike most of the state, the water
district directors are chosen by all voters, not just the farmers.
Only one of the five is a farmer. Some irate state officials are
talking about dismantling the Imperial district. Federal officials
speak of arbitrarily reducing Imperial's take from the Colorado.
Those threats are premature and inflammatory.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law says participants in deals like this can be held
liable for damage to the environment. Imperial feared getting stuck
for hundreds of millions of dollars. Congress and the Interior
Department need to limit the water district's liability as a step
toward reviving the deal. And revive it must. Federal, state and
local officials have just two weeks to keep Interior from reducing
the flow by an amount that serves 1.6 million urban families. That's
a tall order for a problem that has festered for 60 years. Success
could begin with farmers who favor the deal making their wishes more
loudly known.</TE>

<LD>How ironic that the Dec. 11 article about Jimmy Carter receiving the
Nobel Peace Prize was side by side with "Nukes Part of Terror
Policy," as it continued on A5, declaring that nuclear weapons are
part of the administration's threat to use preemptive force against
Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   As the U.N. inspectors scour Iraq for signs of weapons of mass
destruction, the U.S. boasts that we have lots of them and are ready
to use them. No surprise, we are the lone nation that has ever used
them.</LD>
<LD>   This is not a threat to Saddam Hussein but a threat initially to
all life in the area, human and otherwise. It is ultimately a threat
to all life on this green planet.</LD>
<TE>   Nuclear weapons do not seek out "evildoers" but cause mass
destruction of all life.</TE>
<TE>   Let us listen to Carter, who said "global challenges must be met
with an emphasis on peace, in harmony with others" and "we will not
learn to live together in peace by killing each other's children." As
Ralph Bunche was quoted, "The world has ample evidence that war
begets conditions which beget further war."</TE>

<TE>   In an effort to deter terrorists, the Bush administration has

an imminent attack using weapons of mass destruction. Who are the
real terrorists now? I suppose we should go look in a mirror.</TE>

<TE>   How inept can the U.N. inspectors be? President Bush, several
months ago, had hard evidence that Iraq not only had nuclear and
biological weapons but was ready to use them. These dolts who are on
the ground with Sherlock Holmes-like magnifying glasses can't find a
thing. Maybe they're not communicating with Bush. Or maybe what Bush
actually saw was oil and not WMD. This is an easy mistake to make.</TE>

<LD>In "Bill Proposes 'Fingerprinting' of Firearms" (Dec. 11), we read
state Sen. Jack Scott's (D-Altadena) assertion that the National
Rifle Assn. has "opposed almost every sensible gun safety bill." How
does he define a sensible gun safety bill? Violent crime is up in
California. Crimes involving illegal use of firearms result in
innocent civilians being hurt and killed every day in California.
California's gun control laws are among the most restrictive of any
state. Does he think the kinds of gun safety bills that have been
enacted here are sensible? They don't work!</LD>

<TE>   With all the sound and fury surrounding the 2nd Amendment and the
right to bear arms, everyone seems to have overlooked the most
logical solution.</TE>
<TE>   Responsible citizens who are able to pass a background check and
demonstrate proficiency with firearms on a firing range should be
issued a license to carry a concealed weapon. Anyone caught bearing a
concealed weapon without such a license should be subject to
draconian penalties. If all the punks wandering around with .38s in
their hands and malice in their hearts knew that if they were
apprehended they would spend the rest of their lives behind bars,
they might think twice about shooting someone at random. And if they
suspected that their intended victim might have a .38 of his or her
own, they might even think three times about it.</TE>
<TE>   If I were to shoot someone who was trying to rob me, steal my car
or just shoot me for the hell of it, I would feel very bad about it.
But I wouldn't feel nearly as dead as I would be had I been unarmed.</TE>

<LD>"The virtual collapse of Internet technology businesses" isn't
responsible for the "precipitous drop" in income tax receipts
(editorial, Dec. 10). California's budget problems developed from a
reliance on indefensibly high taxes, particularly relative to capital
gains, which California unbelievably treats as ordinary income, which
will plummet from nearly $20 billion in 2000 to about $4 billion this
year. Isn't Sen. John Burton (D-San Francisco) aware that taxpayers
can choose to leave the state, as Tiger Woods did, because of high
California taxes?</LD>

If the proposed $3.2-billion cut from public education becomes

the future of California's fast-food industry is secure. "Would you

<LD>Contrary to Maryanna Abdo's assertions (letter, Dec. 10), America has
always coupled power with benevolence, technological might with
progressive values and wealth with generosity. The countries of
Western Europe, including former enemies Germany and Italy, owe their
very freedom to Americans who died to give it to them. They also owe
whatever economic success they enjoy to the generosity of an America
that gave billions to rebuild after World War II. Likewise for Japan
and South Korea.</LD>
<LD>   But for American blood and generosity, millions of citizens in
Eastern and Western Europe, Asia and Central and South America would
be dead of starvation or, if alive, struggling under fascist or
communist regimes. America deserves praise, gratitude and respect
from the people of these rescued nations. Our citizens should be
immensely proud of our contributions to the peace, survival and
prosperity of the citizens of our world.</LD>

<LD>Re "Parents Sue Ventura County Over Traffic Death of Girl While
Jogging," Dec. 10:</LD>
<LD>   The parents claim that Ventura County was somehow responsible for
their daughter's death because of poor conditions on Santa Rosa Road
that have existed for years.</LD>
<LD>   So how is the father not responsible also? He obviously knew it
was a dangerous road to be jogging on, yet he placed his daughter in
harm's way when he took her jogging.</LD>
<TE>   Now, somehow, $25 million is supposed to make everything better? I
guess for the right price even a child's death doesn't seem so bad.</TE>

<LD>In "A Bumper Crop of Bad Air in San Joaquin Valley" (Dec. 8), retired
state Sen. Dan McCorquodale laments how only City Council members and
county supervisors were allowed to be on the San Joaquin Valley's air
district board. Here's his quote: "By filling up the board with only
elected officials, the cause of clean air was lost right there. It
guaranteed that the only voices heard were those of industry and
business."</LD>
<LD>   Wow, a politician admits that elected officials do not represent
the interests of the people. Instead, they represent the interests of
industry and business -- the corporations that give them millions of
dollars in campaign contributions. We're talking about Republicans
and Democrats, folks. And we're not talking just about Washington; in
this case it was City Council members and county supervisors. Anyone
still wondering why voter turnout is so low?</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult for me to understand why anyone is surprised that
the powers that be in the San Joaquin Valley keep planning and
building without taking any account of the air that no one can
breathe. The majority of the developers and the majority of the
farmers in the valley are good Reagan Republicans. For those of you
who do not remember the Reagan years, he is the one who had a
secretary of the Interior named James Watt. Watt believed that it
didn't matter what we do to the environment because "my
responsibility is to follow the Scriptures, which call upon us to
occupy the land until Jesus returns."</TE>
<TE>   When I moved here in 1978 from Norwalk, I could see the Sierra
Nevada from my bedroom window nearly every day. Now I am lucky to be
able to do so three or four days a month. I would love to do my part
by using public transportation, but there is virtually no such thing
into Fresno from the small town where I live, about 12 miles away.</TE>

<LD>County health officials said Thursday that they had confirmed the
county's first flu case of the 2002-03 season, in an infant from the
South Bay.</LD>
<LD>   The county Department of Health Services said flu shots are the
most effective way to prevent the illness. The department's health
information line -- (800) 427-8700 -- can provide the names of
low-cost medical clinics that offer the vaccine. It takes 10 to 14
days for the vaccine to become fully effective.</LD>

<LD>About 350 people were evacuated from a Burbank Airport terminal for
an hour Thursday morning while authorities searched for a man who had
slipped through a passenger security checkpoint.</LD>
<LD>   Airport police were unable to locate him, but after a sweep of the
building they determined there was no safety threat. It was unclear
why screeners who told the man to wait for a wand check of his
clothing did not stop him when he walked away.</LD>

<LD>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority approved a $13.8-million
increase Thursday in its contract with Siemens Transportation Systems
to buy 52 light-rail cars.</LD>
<LD>   The move, made despite years of unhappiness at the MTA over the
timeliness and condition of the train cars it has received from
Siemens, boosts costs spent on the contract to $215.2 million. The
MTA also agreed to increase its budget for a shuttle and van service
directed at the disabled community by $5 million.</LD>

<HD>Bus Drivers Barred From Long Idling of Engines at School
Sites</HD>
<DH>Effect of diesel exhaust on children is targeted in action
approved by state air quality officials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Miguel Bustillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to reduce children's exposure to unhealthy exhaust, state air
quality officials approved a new rule Thursday that prohibits bus
drivers from leaving engines running idle for long stretches within
100 feet of a school site.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, approved unanimously by the California Air Resources
Board with no formal opposition, requires drivers of school buses and
other heavy-duty vehicles to turn them off if standing still near bus
stops, schools, playfields and other sites where schoolchildren are
present.</LD>
<LD>   Under certain circumstances, drivers can still leave buses running
-- if they need to operate the heater or air-conditioner during
extreme weather conditions, for instance.</LD>
<TE>   "We think this is a rule that will protect children but, at the
same time, will allow for common-sense interpretation by bus
operators," said air board spokesman Jerry Martin. "We don't expect
them to shut the bus off every time they stop for two or three kids
to get on the bus. But if they are going to idle for five minutes,
they should turn the motor off."</TE>
<TE>   The rule is part of a broader effort by state officials to reduce
diesel exhaust -- a mix of soot and toxic gases that has been linked
in health studies to lung cancer, asthma attacks and other
respiratory ailments. State officials have embarked on a plan to cut
diesel exhaust pollution by 75% in all engines by the end of the
decade.</TE>
<TE>   More than 26,000 school buses operate in California, and many are
diesel-burning models that are years, even decades, old. California
and Washington have the oldest school bus fleets in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California and other parts of the state, air quality
officials have approved measures to phase out the heavily polluting
diesel buses in favor of newer, cleaner-burning models. But that
process is expected to take years. In the meantime, officials are
also focusing their efforts on limiting exposure to the exhaust,
especially among children, who are believed to be disproportionately
at risk.</TE>
<TE>   Two environmental groups, the Coalition for Clean Air and the
Natural Resources Defense Council, have been rallying public agencies
to adopt tougher standards by launching a "Dirty Diesel" awareness
campaign. The effort has been credited, not only with spurring
government action, but also with prodding diesel engine manufacturers
to build add-on devices that limit soot and reduce emissions.</TE>
<TE>   The groups praised the state's action Thursday as another positive
step, but called it long overdue. Hawaii, Maryland and Massachusetts
have laws that ban idling by all cars and trucks to reduce air
pollution. California already has a law prohibiting idling by diesel
buses, but the new rules also order bus companies to train drivers,
keep records and track complaints about idling buses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great that we now have a state standard for buses and other
vehicles in close proximity to schools," said Todd Campbell, policy
director with the Coalition for Clean Air. "This should have been
done a long time ago."</TE>

<HD>Transit Projects' Funding Delayed</HD>
<DH>The state defers approval of dozens of requests. Purchase
of extra Gold Line rail cars, other Southland plans are affected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugo Martin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Responding to deep budget cuts proposed by Gov. Gray Davis, the
California Transportation Commission temporarily suspended approval
Thursday of dozens of new spending requests, including funds for
several high-profile projects in Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   In its first meeting since Davis unveiled a plan to cut billions
of dollars from the state budget over the next 18 months, the panel
voted to delay all new spending until February, with the exception of
a handful of safety-related projects such as seismic retrofitting on
freeways.</LD>
<LD>   A Davis spokesman called the commission's move "a positive
action," taken at the administration's urging.</LD>
<TE>   The decision temporarily put on hold funding in Los Angeles County
for two light-rail lines, a downtown Los Angeles pedestrian
improvement project and a rail cargo upgrade, among several other
requests.</TE>
<TE>   But state officials cautioned that no final decision has been made
on any project. "I don't think any project is in jeopardy right now,"
said Commission Chairwoman Dianne McKenna.</TE>
<TE>   Under Davis' proposed cuts, unveiled last week, the California
Department of Transportation would lose $1.8 billion over the next
year and a half, making it one of the hardest-hit agencies. Davis'
overall package recommended $10.2 billion in cuts and other savings
for the rest of this fiscal year and 2003-04.</TE>
<TE>   McKenna said the two-month freeze is needed to give the
Legislature time to respond to the governor's proposed reductions and
possibly recommend ways of increasing revenue to minimize the cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Still, several transportation officials agreed that lawmakers
won't be able to spare Caltrans from some significant cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to be facing some tough financial times," Robert
Garcia, Caltrans' chief financial officer, told the commission at a
meeting in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   After the briefing Garcia said the cuts would probably be felt
especially hard in Southern California, a region plagued by congested
freeways and overburdened bus systems.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles would be hit particularly hard," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the dozens of funding decisions postponed Thursday was a
request for $15.4 million by the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority to purchase 50 passenger cars for the new Metro Rail Gold
Line between downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena, which is scheduled to
open in July.</TE>
<TE>   Also postponed was a $14-million request by the MTA for
preliminary engineering studies of the so-called Exposition Line
between downtown and Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the commission put off approval of $9.6 million for a
road and sidewalk improvement project on Grand Avenue in downtown Los
Angeles that MTA officials had hoped would be completed in time for
the October grand opening of Walt Disney Concert Hall.</TE>
<TE>   A decision on a $6.8-million MTA request to improve a rail line
that carries cargo from downtown Los Angeles to Riverside County was
also deferred.</TE>
<TE>   MTA officials attending the meeting worried that the commission's
decision to postpone the funding could cause some serious problems.</TE>
<TE>   The delay won't hamper the launch of the Gold Line; about 50
passenger cars have already been purchased. However, MTA officials
worry that waiting to buy the additional 50 might make it difficult
to serve the heavy ridership expected after the line opens and is
extended to the Eastside, said David Yale, director of capital
planning for the MTA.</TE>
<TE>   He also said the funding delays could cause havoc if the Grand
Avenue project is under construction when Disney Hall opens.</TE>
<TE>   The commission plans to meet in January with local transportation
officials from throughout the state to discuss how to pare their wish
lists. Projects whose funding has already been approved will probably
not be cut, but some commission members said the budget crisis could
freeze funding for every new transportation project in the state for
the next year and a half.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like Caltrans and our staff will go into a mode of
trying to keep up the roads we have now and not building any new
roads," said Commissioner John R. Lawson.</TE>
<TE>   As the commission gathered in San Jose, somber MTA officials
meeting in Los Angeles began to discuss how to keep their favorite
projects alive.</TE>
<TE>   MTA chief Roger Snoble, who has tried to rally the county around a
unified vision for transportation since he took over last year, told
the MTA board that the budget crunch underscored the need for the
county's disparate regions to agree on a few major projects.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to be leaders on this," he said, adding that if the MTA
does not build its priority projects, traffic in the region will
worsen.</TE>
<TE>   MTA board member and county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky urged his
colleagues to fight the cuts so transportation funding does not
become the state's "repository for getting money."</TE>
<TE>   In the San Fernando Valley, Caltrans officials said, the actions
Thursday will probably not delay the soon-to-open auxiliary lane on
the San Diego Freeway just south of the Ventura Freeway, or a bridge
project on the Golden State Freeway in Santa Clarita, because money
has already been allocated for them.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, officials have predicted that the budget crisis
could delay construction of a long-awaited expansion of the Garden
Grove Freeway, which hasn't had a major upgrade since it opened
almost 35 years ago.</TE>

<HD>Sonoma Supervisor Takes Over Coastal Panel</HD>
<DH>The often-divided commission, which split 6-6 Wednesday,
unites behind Mike Reilly after Dave Potter withdraws from
acrimonious race.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Coastal Commission on Thursday unanimously picked
Sonoma County Supervisor Mike Reilly as its new chairman, ending an
acrimonious battle for leadership of the panel that controls
development along the state's priciest and most coveted real estate.</LD>
<LD>   The 12 commissioners, at the urging of Democratic leaders in
Sacramento, rallied around the even-tempered Reilly to replace
environmental activist Sara Wan. She relinquished the chairmanship on
Wednesday, charging that it had become clear the governor and
Assembly speaker wanted someone else for the job.</LD>
<LD>   Wan had been considered perhaps the commission's strongest voice
for controlling construction and improving access to the coast. She
had angered Gov. Gray Davis and his top aides on a number of
occasions, including by leading a commission majority to nudge San
Diego to upgrade its sewage treatment plant, which doesn't meet
federal clean water standards. Lynn Shenk, a former congresswoman
from San Diego and now Davis' chief of staff, was particularly
incensed by the decision.</LD>
<TE>   The battles on the commission sometimes reflect differences that
crop up among the state's top leaders. Davis appoints four
commissioners. The other eight are split between Assembly Speaker
Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) and Senate President Pro Tem John Burton
(D-San Francisco).</TE>
<TE>   The commissioners, who had split 6-6 on Wan's successor on
Wednesday, came together Thursday after Dave Potter agreed to
withdraw from the chairmanship race.</TE>
<TE>   Potter said he and other more-moderate commissioners accomplished
what they set out to do: wrest the gavel from Wan's hands. His
temper, he said, had cooled overnight and he and other like-minded
commissioners agreed it was time to end the infighting and personal
attacks that left many feeling bruised.</TE>
<TE>   Potter is generally considered more supportive of development than
Reilly.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a family," Potter said of his fellow commissioners.
"Every family has internal dysfunctions. I decided the best thing for
me and for the commission was ... to suck it up and not take it
personally."</TE>
<TE>   Cynthia McClain-Hill, commissioner and Los Angeles attorney who
was trying to orchestrate Wan's ouster, said she was pleased to see a
change of leadership, even if it wasn't her previously favored
candidate, Potter.</TE>
<TE>   Reilly, 58, during his 5 1/2 years on the commission, has racked
up a voting record that gets far higher marks from environmentalists
than Potter, a Monterey County supervisor and concrete contractor,
and McClain-Hill, who manages a Los Angeles law firm that helps
clients navigate land-use rules and environmental laws.</TE>
<TE>   Reilly, who ran a nonprofit group to aid rural residents, called
Thursday's vote the "first step" toward ending power struggles and
bridging the ideological gap on the commission.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had calls from several people in the [state] Capitol,"
Reilly said. "All of them were very positive and supportive."</TE>

<HD>Newport, Arbor Society Settle Balboa Ficus Dispute</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stanley Allison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Newport Beach officials settled their legal dispute Thursday with a
group that went to court to preserve 25 ficus trees that once draped
Balboa Peninsula's Main Street.</LD>
<LD>   The accord was mostly a symbolic victory for the Balboa Arbor
Society, however, because the city had removed 23 of the trees in
September.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement, which was signed at City Hall, states that the city
will make good-faith efforts to maintain one of the two remaining
trees, will review the city's tree policy and consider adoption of a
new tree ordinance, and will pay the society's attorney $56,000 in
fees.</LD>
<TE>   The city will remove the tree in front of a pharmacy but will keep
the one in front of the Balboa Inn.</TE>
<TE>   Officials had wanted to remove all the trees, which were planted
in the 1960s, because they stood in the way of a $2.8-million
improvement project on Main Street.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, the society agreed to drop its lawsuit and an
injunction that had sought to halt removal of the trees.</TE>
<TE>   The Arbor Society had won the injunction in August, stalling the
city's attempts to remove the trees, at least until a full hearing
could be scheduled in mid-September.</TE>
<TE>   But another judge lifted the injunction before the hearing, and
the city cut the trees down.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the society and city were in court for the full
hearing -- during which the society succeeded in getting the
injunction reinstated -- 23 of the trees were gone. The injunction,
however, prevented the city from removing the stumps and the two
remaining trees.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's settlement allows city crews to remove the stumps,
which they will do next week, and install temporary decorated holiday
trees.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Tod W. Ridgeway, whose district covers Balboa Village,
said the agreement "is definitely good news for all of us and means
work on the village can begin right after the holidays."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the improvement plan calls for new sidewalks, curbs and
gutters. The city plans to replace the mature trees with young coral
gum trees, which grow more slowly than ficus and have less-aggressive
roots.</TE>
<TE>   The ficus, imported from India and the Mediterranean, have been
planted all over Southern California since the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   But they are fast-growing, and their thick, shallow roots can
spread 20 feet or more.</TE>
<TE>   The roots of the trees had broken through sidewalks, cracked the
foundations of some homes and businesses, and threatened sewer pipes,
city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Linda and Bud Grant, who say they spent about $15,000 fighting
City Hall, said the trees' majesty and charm outweighed any problems
they might have caused.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, the Arbor Society, which disputed the need to remove the
trees, offered other suggestions. Group members said the city could
prune the roots, install devices to block root growth or, at worst,
remove just the trees that posed the most problems.</TE>

<HD>Condo Fire Leaves 10 Homeless</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Kelly</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A fire raced through three condominiums in Ventura on Thursday
morning, leaving 10 people -- five of them children -- homeless and
causing an estimated $750,000 in damage.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze began about 11:30 a.m. in a ground-floor unit of the
Peppertree Condominium complex on Saratoga Avenue. By the time
firefighters responded, flames were pouring out of the condo and into
the two units above it.</LD>
<LD>   "I called 911 and then ran over with my fire extinguisher, but it
was so huge I just said, 'forget it,' " said Tracey Cherrie, 44, who
lives a few yards from where the fire occurred. More than 35 fire
personnel struggled to knock down what they described as a stubborn
blaze, especially dangerous in the densely packed complex of 343
white stucco condos. After 40 minutes, the main fire was out, but
pockets of flame remained in the units.</LD>
<TE>   "Any complex like this is a challenge," said Deputy Fire Marshal
Brian Clark of the Ventura Fire Department. "You have to make sure
you don't have fires going into the adjacent units."</TE>
<TE>   One unidentified woman suffered burns to her hand but her
condition was unknown. The cause of the fire remains under
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was a tragedy for Arturo Ahedo and his family, who lived
in the condo where the blaze broke out.</TE>
<TE>   Ahedo, 29, stood quietly on the grass, looking into the blackened
ruins of his home. Everything inside was incinerated.</TE>
<TE>   He, his wife and 6-year-old son were not home when the fire began
but his 2-year-old daughter and her baby-sitter were inside but
escaped.</TE>
<TE>   "God was protecting my little girl," he said. "You never expect
this but I will go to church tonight. I will go and thank God that my
family is OK."</TE>
<TE>   The family's pastor, Fernando Franco of Oxnard, showed up to
comfort them. "We all start out with nothing and I think God will
give them even more now," he said. "I think they got the best gift
today, their daughter's life."</TE>
<TE>   Another woman standing nearby sobbed into the arms of a friend.
She lost her home and her dog, a 6-year-old border collie. "I'll have
these restored as soon as possible," said Ray Marquez, manager of the
complex. "These people need homes, especially at this time of the
year." Marquez said he had some empty units that could be rented by
the families.</TE>
<TE>   As he spoke, firefighters hauled charred chairs and couches from
the condos. The Red Cross provided food to the displaced families as
well as vouchers for local motels, meals and clothing.</TE>
<TE>   Clark said this is a dangerous time of year for fires because of
lighted candles that people forget and electrical problems with
holiday decorations. "All I can tell people is be careful," he said.
"This is the time of year when we get a lot of preventable fires, and
it's a real tragedy."</TE>

<HD>3rd Man Arrested in 1991 Slaying of Teen</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man suspected in the 1991 fatal shooting of a 14-year-old girl
after a football game at Tustin High School was arrested early
Thursday at a relative's home in Murrieta, becoming the last of three
cousins charged in a long-running case marked by custody snafus with
Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Garcia, 29, was put under surveillance Wednesday night and
taken into custody about 5:30 the next morning by a team of
investigators from the Tustin Police Department and the Orange County
district attorney's office, authorities said. Garcia's cousins had
been captured and convicted years ago. Ruben Guerrero, who was
arrested shortly after the shooting, is serving 27 years to life in
prison.</LD>
<LD>   Albert Guerrero, 34, who was found in 1995 while hiding in Mexico,
is serving 30 years to life.</LD>
<TE>   Garcia is suspected of firing the shot that killed Lilia Vianey
Guevara, a Westminster High School sophomore, on Sept. 13, 1991. She
and her friends were arriving at a Tustin party when a fistfight
broke out between two groups of young men, so they got back in their
vehicle and fled, trailed by gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   When Guevara turned to see what was going on, she was struck in
the chest by a bullet.</TE>
<TE>   The last arrest punctuates a case that in 1995 took investigators
to Mexico, where Garcia and his cousin Albert Guerrero were known to
be living. After months of fitful negotiations and a lobbying effort
that included a letter from Tustin officials to then-President
Clinton, Mexican officials turned Guerrero over to the FBI. Garcia
remained a fugitive.</TE>
<TE>   Nasario Solis, who at the time was the lead police detective on
the case and now is an investigator with the district attorney's
office, said he is relieved that the manhunt is finally over.</TE>
<TE>   "It's taken a lot of work from a lot of people," he said. "You
don't kill a 14-year-old girl and disappear. People don't forget. I
didn't forget. Tustin didn't forget."</TE>
<TE>   Guevara's mother now lives in Brownsville, Texas, and police there
were trying to track her down to relay the news.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators from the district attorney's fledgling Due Diligence
Unit said they relied on old-fashioned detective work to find Garcia,
accessing records from the motor vehicle department, automobile
leasing companies and other sources.</TE>
<TE>   They do not yet know where else he had been in the seven years
since they believed he was living in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The Due Diligence Unit was assembled less than two weeks ago to
find 140 fugitives by looking for new leads in old cases.</TE>

<HD>Klimt Art Suit May Proceed, Court Says</HD>
<DH>Plaintiff against Austria hopes to recover paintings seized
by the Nazis in 1939.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that an elderly West Los
Angeles woman is entitled to go forward with a lawsuit against
Austria in which she seeks to recover six paintings worth $150
million seized by the Nazis in 1939.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-0 decision marked the first time in Holocaust reparations
litigation that a federal appeals court has ruled that a foreign
government can be held accountable in a U.S. court.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a milestone in Holocaust restitution litigation," said
Whittier Law School professor Michael Bazyler, an expert on such
litigation.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco rejected
Austria's contention that it was protected by a federal law that
normally shields foreign countries from lawsuits in U.S. courts.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit also spurned Austria's argument that if plaintiff
Maria V. Altmann is entitled to a trial, it should be held in Austria
because the case involves events that occurred there, and the
contested paintings by Austrian artist Gustav Klimt are now displayed
in the government-run Austrian Gallery in Vienna.</TE>
<TE>   Altmann, who fled to California after the Nazi takeover of Austria
in 1938, should get a chance to prove that the paintings were taken
in violation of international law, the court ruled.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm totally thrilled," Altmann said Thursday. "I'm so absolutely
grateful to this country and the judges." Altmann said that she had
tried to reach a compromise with the Austrian government four years
ago without success and that her stance on the issue has intensified
since.</TE>
<TE>   "I want those paintings to be in American and Canadian museums,"
she said. In particular, Altmann said she hoped that some day one of
the paintings would hang in the Getty. "That's my dream."</TE>
<TE>   The Austrian government maintains that the paintings at issue "are
national treasures and part of the cultural heritage of the Republic
[of Austria]."</TE>
<TE>   "This is an unprecedented victory and we are very happy with it,"
said Altmann's attorney E. Randol Schoenberg. Schoenberg said his
pleasure was tempered by the fact that the case is now 2 years old,
his client is nearly 87 and there is no imminent prospect of a trial
because he expects Austria to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney Scott Cooper, who represents Austria, said
that because he had not had a chance to speak with his client, he
could not comment.</TE>
<TE>   Other Holocaust suits involving art, bank accounts, insurance and
slave labor, have been settled out of court.</TE>
<TE>   In a detailed ruling, Judge Kim M. Wardlaw said that the illegal
seizure of the paintings from Altmann's uncle, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer
-- fell within the "expropriation exception" of the Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act -- the law under which Austria had claimed protection.</TE>
<TE>   Wardlaw emphasized that compelling Altmann to sue in Austria would
present major practical problems. Under Austrian legal rules,
Altmann, who has been trying to recover the paintings for years,
would have to pay at least a $135,000 fee to file her suit there,
compared to $150 in the U.S. Secondly, Altmann's claims probably
would be barred in Austria because of a 30-year statute of
limitations.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit contends that the Nazis took the paintings to
"Aryanize" them in violation of international law, and that the
Austrian government of that era was complicit in the seizure. Altmann
alleges that the current Austrian government deceived her and her
uncle's other heirs about how it had obtained the paintings. And
Altmann contends that the Austrian government and the Austrian
Gallery wrongfully claim ownership of the paintings.</TE>
<TE>   "Altmann has alleged sufficient facts, which if proven, would
demonstrate that the Klimt paintings were taken in violation of
international law," Wardlaw wrote. "The Nazis did not even pretend to
take the Klimt paintings for a public purpose," the judge added.</TE>
<TE>   Altmann's uncle was a Jewish sugar magnate who had supported
anti-Nazi activities and fled Austria after Hitler annexed the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's decision upholds a decision by U.S. District Judge
Florence-Marie Cooper who ruled last year that a U.S. court had
jurisdiction to hear the case.</TE>
<TE>   While acknowledging the general rule that foreign nations are
immune from suit in the U.S., Cooper said there was an exception when
property is taken in violation of international law, when it is owned
or operated by an agency of the foreign country, and when the agency
is engaged in commercial activity in the U.S. The appeals court
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Wardlaw noted that in 2000, the Austrian Gallery, in affiliation
with Yale University Press, published a book in the U.S. titled
"Klimt's Women." The book includes some of the paintings that are the
subject of Altmann's lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Austrian Gallery publishes a guidebook in English
that can be purchased in the U.S. Featured on the cover is Klimt's
"Adele Bloch-Bauer I," a full-length gold painting of Altmann's aunt,
a prominent art collector. Considered one of Klimt's two best-known
paintings, it is valued at $50 million to $60 million and is one of
the paintings at issue in Altmann's lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Austria's attorneys asserted that Adele Bloch-Bauer, who died in
1925, had requested in her will that her husband, Ferdinand, give the
Klimt paintings to the Austria Gallery after her death. Altmann
countered that Ferdinand, who died in Zurich in 1945, specified in
his will that his substantial estate would be divided among two
nieces and a nephew. Altmann is the only one of the three still
living.</TE>
<TE>   Ferdinand received no compensation for the paintings, his home, a
valuable porcelain collection or the sugar factory he left behind
when he fled Austria. Some of his 19th century paintings were sent to
Adolf Hitler and Hermann Goering, one of Hitler's chief aides.</TE>
<TE>   After World War II ended, Austria declared that all transactions
motivated by discriminatory ideology were null and void, but
government officials said the decree did not apply to the Klimt
paintings. Austrian law prohibited the export of artworks deemed
important to the country's cultural heritage.</TE>
<TE>   In December 1998, Austria enacted a law providing for the
restitution of art objects seized during the Nazi era. The Altmann
family recovered some pieces, including valuable porcelains. But the
state-run Austrian Gallery continues to maintain that it is entitled
to keep the Klimt paintings because of the desires expressed by Adele
Bloch-Bauer in her will.</TE>
<TE>   Altmann's suit contends that Adele was merely voicing a desire
that has no binding effect, and that her uncle "never would have
donated anything to Austria after the way he had been treated."</TE>
<TE>   After hearing oral arguments last March on Austria's appeal of
Cooper's ruling, the 9th Circuit, in an unusual move, ordered the two
sides to participate in court-ordered mediation. But that initiative
failed after one session, setting the stage for Thursday's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Judges William Fletcher and Ronald Whyte joined Wardlaw's opinion.</TE>

<HD>Ventura Chase Suspect Is Found Hiding in Back Yard</HD>
<DH>Police dog flushes the man out from under a wagon after a
wary neighbor calls officers.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A high-speed chase along a Ventura thoroughfare ended in a quiet
residential neighborhood Thursday when a homeowner called police to
tell them their suspect was hiding in his back yard.</LD>
<LD>   A police dog found Ronald Franklin, 23, of Ventura hiding under a
wagon in a yard in the 2800 block of Mohawk Avenue about 1 1/2 hours
after the chase. Franklin had been carrying a sawed-off shotgun,
stolen electronic equipment and unspecified illegal drugs in a stolen
vehicle, Sgt. Darin Schindler said.</LD>
<LD>   Franklin had fled from Officer Jason Pray after Pray tried to pull
him over for speeding at El Medio Street and Ventura Avenue. Franklin
took off down the avenue, at more than 90 mph for a short distance,
before losing control of the vehicle, Schindler said.</LD>
<TE>   The car fishtailed and hit a chain-link fence. The driver escaped
on foot.</TE>
<TE>   With nowhere to go, he scrambled -- sometimes on his hands and
knees -- up a steep hill near several oil wells on unincorporated
county land, authorities said. "I was surprised he got up there,"
Schindler said. "That's a pretty steep incline."</TE>
<TE>   The hill was too steep for the officers in pursuit to climb and
they lost track of the suspect. The police then surrounded the
neighborhood and dispatched a helicopter and a dog to help with the
search.</TE>
<TE>   Ninety minutes later, a neighborhood man called to tell police he
thought the suspect was hiding in his back yard, about a mile from
where he had escaped from officers. Police had earlier notified
residents that a suspect was loose in the vicinity.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd crouched down in a corner and laid a wagon over him,"
Schindler said.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin refused to come out from under the wagon, and a police
dog was sent in. The dog bit Franklin on the arm and leg and the
suspect was arrested shortly thereafter, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin was taken to Ventura County Medical Center for treatment
and was booked on suspicion of driving a stolen vehicle, evading
arrest, possession of narcotics and possession of anillegal weapon.
The vehicle had been stolen in Kern County on Wednesday, police said.</TE>

<HD>Head Start Agency Accused of Fraud</HD>
<DH>Teachers' and parents' complaints prompt an internal probe
at Latin American Civic Assn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Pierson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the largest providers of Head Start child-care programs in Los
Angeles County has launched an internal investigation into
accusations by employees and parents of fraud and mismanagement,
officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Under the supervision of the county Office of Education, the
nonprofit Latin American Civic Assn. is looking into numerous
complaints of misconduct, including pressuring teachers to falsify
documents about the number of hours parents have volunteered at the
agency's 24 campuses.</LD>
<LD>   Each hour is worth about $15 in funding credits to the
association. The in-kind contributions are factored toward its
obligation to match 20% of its $9.76 million in annual federal
funding. The association receives the money through its contract with
the Office of Education.</LD>
<TE>   Irene Tovar, the association's executive director, dismissed the
allegations against her agency, which serves 1,385 mostly poor
preschoolers in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys. Tovar,
63, said she has made enemies by raising educational standards in the
300-member agency, prompting some to fear for their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to allegations of mismanagement, Tovar, the
association's leader since 1993, is accused of having used the agency
as a platform to fight Valley secession by sponsoring a symposium
last May exploring city breakup.</TE>
<TE>   Tovar, a prominent figure in the Democratic party and in Latino
politics in the region since the 1960s, said she always made it clear
that her advocacy was personal and did not represent the views of the
association. She said the symposium was an educational forum, not a
rally.</TE>
<TE>   But officials said they are concerned about all of the accusations
levied against Tovar and the agency and will ensure that a thorough
investigation is conducted.</TE>
<TE>   "They're fairly serious" allegations, said Frank Kwan, a spokesman
for the Office of Education. "It has our attention, without a doubt."</TE>
<TE>   Kwan said the allegations came as his office was nearing
completion of its annual audit of the nonprofit group. He said no
glaring problems have been discovered so far, but that the audit's
release will be delayed at least a month because officials "were
going back and being much more thorough."</TE>
<TE>   Tovar said some of the agency's troubles center on the fact that
some staff members are uncomfortable about Head Start's requirement
that half its teaching staff hold bachelor of arts or associate of
arts degrees by September.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a fear factor that they're going to lose their jobs,"
said Tovar, who was a high-profile aide to former California Gov.
Jerry Brown and who was disqualified in her bid for a Los Angeles
City Council seat in 1993 after failing to collect enough voter
signatures to keep her name on the ballot. She currently is on the
board of Los Angeles Mission College and is president of Cal State
Northridge's alumni association.</TE>
<TE>   Ruben Zacarias, chairman of the association's nine-member board,
said he expects Tovar to file a written response to the allegations
by next week. After that, the board will conduct its own
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a responsibility to look into these allegations and take
corrective or disciplinary action if need be," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tovar is being blamed for the bitter relationship between the
teachers union and the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Adrianne Lerma, a steward in the teachers union, said morale is
low and many want Tovar to resign. Lerma complained about crowded
conditions at the agency's North Hills school, where classes run from
7 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., rather than the standard 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. She
said the shift violates a union agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "We have teachers standing and eating their lunch because there's
nowhere to sit," Lerma said. "They're holding their class material in
the back of their car because there's no desks. They're also going
home late at night in unsafe neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   Some teachers accuse Tovar of verbal abuse, intimidation and
ignoring requests for meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "I was wrongly terminated," said Blanca Mendez, a teacher for 25
years who was fired last year for leaving her North Hollywood campus
without permission. Mendez said she went off-site to laminate
classroom material and was never given a chance to dispute her
dismissal.</TE>
<TE>   Tovar said she cannot always be accessible because of her
workload, and she has assistants to handle personnel matters.</TE>
<TE>   Some teachers and parents say the agency's employees work in fear
of being reprimanded and are controlled by a handful of supervisors
loyal to Tovar.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a nonprofit mafia," said Susan Lopez-McKinney, whose mother
was a former personnel administrator who left the agency after a
dispute with Tovar in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez-McKinney's 5-year-old daughter attended the agency's Granada
Hills site and is one of several children who have recently been
denied mental health services advertised by the agency as a free
provision, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The North Hills resident also said she signed blank forms that
teachers would later fill out "creatively" to show she had
volunteered 16 hours a month. In reality, she volunteered an average
of three hours a month, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Such practices are widespread, said Oralia Mongue, who was fired
over a dispute with a supervisor in October 2001, after 15 years with
the organization.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if a parent spent half an hour taking out the trash, I have
to put down lies and say they were doing something for six hours,"
she said.</TE>

<HD>From the Mouths of Babes: Kids Offer Lesson for Carson
Officials</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Carson hosted a holiday banquet Wednesday night to honor
young winners of an essay contest on good citizenship and, one by
one, the children were presented medallions by a mayor under
indictment on corruption charges.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the bright-eyed winners, who attend Grades 3 through 8,
wore their Sunday best and were accompanied by parents and
grandparents. Nobody was going to let the latest round of corruption
ruin a big night for the kids.</LD>
<LD>   The Carson Community Center sparkled with camera flashes as proud
parents posed their children in front of winning entries in the "Why
I Like Carson" contest.</LD>
<TE>   "Home sweet home, that is what I call Carson," wrote April
Brakefield, a fifth-grader from Del Amo Elementary School. "I pledge
to be responsible, trustworthy, and a helpful citizen of Carson."</TE>
<TE>   April's essay, like all 29 winning entries, should be required
reading for anybody running for office in Carson, where the last two
mayors have been arrested. The city of 90,000 has a long history of
corruption, and federal prosecutors alleged last month that a
majority of the City Council was for sale, extorting money from local
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "The adults need to learn from the children," agreed Chris
Recalde, whose daughter Christine, a sixth-grader at Caroldale
Learning Community, won first place honors for an essay about the
Golden Rule.</TE>
<TE>   And what is that rule? I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Do unto others," Christine said, "as you would have them do unto
you."</TE>
<TE>   Many public officials in Carson seem to have read only the first
clause of the Golden Rule. And speaking of indicted Mayor Daryl
Sweeney, Chris Recalde said:</TE>
<TE>   "How can he present a good citizenship award to little kids when
we don't know if he's a good citizen?"</TE>
<TE>   Pat Hellerud, a retired teacher and longtime resident of Carson,
looked at the dozens of children and said: "Thank God they're not old
enough to know the truth. Right now, Carson is in turmoil."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the kids know more than you might think.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-grader Kevin Sanchez, who goes to 232nd Place Elementary
School, said in his winning essay that he wanted to run for mayor.
When I asked the 9-year-old why, he said:</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to help City Hall."</TE>
<TE>   If the current mayor is convicted, Kevin said, he ought to do
time. And his sentence?</TE>
<TE>   "One year in prison."</TE>
<TE>   One indicted councilwoman, Raunda Frank, had the good sense to
stay away from the awards banquet. But Mayor Sweeney, who has claimed
he will be exonerated despite a grand jury depiction of him as the
corruption ringleader, was front and center as he awaited the call to
hand out awards.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a crying shame," said Hellerud. "The honorable thing
would be to resign, and if he's proven innocent," to try and return.
"Would you want to do business with a city whose officials are under
indictment?"</TE>
<TE>   To find a master of ceremonies, Carson reached deep into its past
for a mayor who hadn't been indicted. Gil Smith spoke about the
city's great future, as represented by the bright children in the
room, and then introduced the current mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney, to everyone's relief, had very little to say, and then he
was joined by several other public officials. Children were given
certificates and cash awards, and then posed for pictures with the
mayor after he presented the medallions.</TE>
<TE>   Had I been in charge, I would have hired an armored truck to
deliver the cash directly to the homes of the children, just to make
sure they got it.</TE>
<TE>   City officials expected 100 people at the awards ceremony, but 200
showed up, and more chairs had to be carted in. The room was filled
with warmth and with hope, and it made the South Bay city's history
of corruption all the more damnable.</TE>
<TE>   Carson is a real place. It's not some drive-by outpost that exists
to be plundered and pillaged by one dirt-bag after another.</TE>
<TE>   The winning essayists wrote passionately about Carson and
suggested dozens of ways residents could make it an even better place
to live.</TE>
<TE>   "Another thing I can do," wrote Kayleen Kaminura, a fourth-grader
at Del Amo Elementary, "is to tell any person to never, never, ever
leave the city of Carson."</TE>
<TE>   "Besides littering," wrote Dominique Perry-Edwards, a sixth-grader
at Glenn Hammond Curtiss Middle School, "this is just about the worst
thing to happen: SHOOTING! Oh how I hate to turn on the news every
day and always see something about someone being shot.... Another
thing I would try to stop is: GRAFFITI. Yeah, all you gang-bangers
know what I'm talking about."</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Gonzales, a third-grader at Del Amo, promised to quit
being so stubborn and do his homework on time, help with the
recycling, and give his teacher, Ms. Grabow, an apple.</TE>
<TE>   "When I grow up," he wrote, "I will be one of those who will be
proud to say that I have been a better citizen for the city of Carson
since I was 7 years old."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Correction: In Wednesday's column, I incorrectly said former New
York Mayor Rudy Giuliani wrote two books this year. "America's Mayor"
was written by someone else, and Giuliani's spokeswoman said Giuliani
doesn't refer to himself that way.</TE>
<TE>   My apologies.</TE>

<HD>'Rape' Was Porn Shoot, Defense Says</HD>
<DH>Defense says videos will show that the millionaire accused
of date-rape was just making porn movies with consenting people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Millionaire date-rape suspect Andrew Luster was an aspiring producer
of pornography who was practicing his craft when he filmed himself
having sex with a woman while she pretended to be asleep, his
attorneys told a judge Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   During a hearing, defense lawyers said excerpts of Luster's
homemade movies, including one titled "Babes and Waves," should be
shown to jurors when the 38-year-old surfer's trial begins next week.
They would counter testimony from women who say they were drugged and
raped at his beach house in Mussel Shoals, lawyers said.</LD>
<LD>   "That is crucial to our defense," Santa Monica attorney Roger Jon
Diamond argued. He said it is clear from videotape excerpts that one
of the alleged rape victims, a former girlfriend who lived with
Luster five years ago, engaged in consensual sex before the camera.</LD>
<TE>   "[She] was playing for the camera," he said. "We are talking about
a performance here."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors asked Ventura County Superior Court Judge Ken Riley to
exclude those excerpts.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Anthony Wold said a separate tape seized by
detectives shows the intoxicated and sleeping girlfriend being raped
by Luster on their first date in October 1996. Unaware of the
encounter, she later struck up a relationship with Luster and made at
least one consensual film with him, Wold said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors intend to offer the October 1996 tape as evidence of
rape of an unconscious person, but argue that subsequent recordings
are not relevant and are being submitted only to sully the victim.</TE>
<TE>   Diamond accused prosecutors of trying to put a "straitjacket" on
the defense and urged Riley to let jurors see the tapes to determine
the relevance.</TE>
<TE>   The judge is expected to release a tentative ruling on the tape
request this morning.</TE>

<TE>   Luster, the great-grandson of cosmetics legend Max Factor, is
charged with 87 crimes, including multiple counts of rape, sexual
battery, sodomy and poisoning. He is accused of raping three
unconscious women at his house after knocking them out with the
date-rape drug gamma hydroxybutyrate Defense attorneys say the sexual
encounters were consensual and have portrayed the alleged victims as
a scorned lover out for revenge and two party girls who drank too
much and are now embarrassed by their actions.</TE>

women, who were questioned extensively by the defense about their
views of and exposure to hard-core pornography.</TE>

<HD>Nickel-a-Drink Fee Sought to Fund Trauma Centers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Matea Gold and Jose Cardenas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing California's stressed emergency care system and the state's
deepening budget troubles, a state legislator Thursday called on her
colleagues to approve a nickel-per-drink fee on alcoholic beverages
to help fund trauma services.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Bill 5x, written by state Sen. Gloria Romero (D-Los
Angeles) and supported by some physicians and hospital executives,
would levy the fee of five cents per drink on alcohol distributors.
She said it would generate an estimated $500 million a year. The
money would be used to reimburse emergency rooms and trauma centers
for the cost of treating alcohol-related emergencies.</LD>
<LD>   Romero, who introduced a similar measure in the last legislative
session, said the current budget crisis has created a pressing need
for the nickel fee.</LD>
<TE>   "The alcohol industry needs to assume greater responsibility for
the increasing health-care costs associated with the use of their
products," Romero said during a news conference at White Memorial
Medical Center in Boyle Heights.</TE>
<TE>   The measure comes amid a special legislative session to address
the state's projected $21-billion deficit. Gov. Gray Davis has
proposed $10.2 billion in cuts and savings to take effect over the
next 18 months, including $2 billion in health and human services.</TE>
<TE>   Even as legislators consider the effects of those proposed cuts,
some predict that the state's shortfall could balloon further,
perhaps reaching $30 billion for the remainder of this fiscal year,
which ends June 30, and the following year. Davis spokesman Steve
Maviglio said the governor had not yet taken a position on Romero's
bill. But Republican lawmakers, who have vowed to oppose any effort
to increase state revenue through taxes and fees, said they would not
support it.</TE>
<TE>   "The imposition of another tax -- whether it be for beer or
Twinkies or whatever -- will have a further devastating impact on the
economy," said Assemblyman Robert Pacheco (R-Walnut), the ranking
Republican on the Assembly Health Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly GOP Leader Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks) called the measure
"well-intentioned, but just the wrong approach."</TE>
<TE>   "In the final analysis, this is just an increase in taxes," Cox
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Romero said the measure would be a fee, not a tax, and argued
that, because it would be assessed at the wholesale level,
distributors could absorb the cost without passing on an increase to
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike raising taxes, which requires a two-thirds vote of the
Legislature, lawmakers can raise fees with a simple majority vote --
giving Romero's measure an advantage in the Democrat-controlled
Legislature. Fees are supposed to cover the specific costs of a
service rather than subsidize general government expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Alcohol interests, however, are balking at picking up part of the
tab for emergency services.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand they are looking for ways to bridge that deficit
the state is facing but, quite frankly, I'm surprised they would look
at a drink tax, because it's quite possibly the worst way to generate
additional tax revenue," said Victor Franco, state affairs manager
for the Miller Brewing Co.</TE>
<TE>   Franco said that increasing the cost of beer and wine would punish
responsible drinkers and reduce sales.</TE>
<TE>   "In our opinion, it's a highly regressive fee that affects low-
and moderate-income beer drinkers, and it will increase the cost of
our products," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The bill defines a drink, the amount subject to the nickel fee, as
1.5 ounces of hard liquor, 12 ounces of beer or five ounces of wine.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, efforts funded by the alcohol industry helped defeat a
similar nickel-a-drink ballot initiative. On Thursday, industry
officials indicated they would also fight this measure if it were
adopted.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Falasco, a lobbyist for the Wine Institute, which
represents many vintners, said his organization would "seriously"
consider a referendum to have the fee repealed if it passed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the biggest issue that can affect us," Falasco said,
noting that the industry is especially offended by the "stigma" of
being identified with emergency room use. "There is nothing that is
more onerous."</TE>
<TE>   But backers said the measure would provide vital funding for an
emergency system that is stretched to the limit. More than 60
emergency rooms and 30 trauma centers have permanently closed in the
last decade, forcing those left to frequently turn ambulances away
because of overcrowding.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, between one-fourth and one-half of hospitals are
overwhelmed every day, according to Anthony Abbate, regional vice
president of the Hospital Assn. of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in the midst of a true crisis," said Dr. Wes Fields,
president-elect of the California chapter of the American College of
Emergency Physicians.</TE>
<TE>   Romero noted that about one out of every three emergencies treated
in the state's emergency rooms is alcohol-related, and that alcohol
is a factor in 32% of California's car crashes.</TE>

<HD>Aging Baby Boomers, Once Wild, Are Reborn to Be Mild at
Rock Concert</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As he took his seat for a rock concert at the Wiltern, Greg
Horbachevsky of Glendale noticed that the woman on his left was
knitting. Two people on his right were reading books. Another fan,
apparently afflicted with a bad hip, was being helped up the steps by
an usher and a 30-ish man, perhaps her son.</LD>
<LD>   "I suddenly realized how old I am," said Horbachevsky, 57. This
was a baby-boomer concert starring Joe Cocker, the onetime
wild-living English rocker, now 58.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty years ago, when Horbachevsky attended a Cocker concert at
the Forum, the spectators were much noisier. Something else also was
different this time at the Wiltern.</LD>
<TE>   "There wasn't a whiff of pot," Horbachevsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of aging: Tony Litwinko of Glendale noticed that a real
estate agent listed some pastries among one property's charms (see
accompanying). Let's hope they were in the freezer.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the agent might have meant to say "sconce," which is a
bracket attached to a wall, often to hold a candle. (OK, I admit it.
I had to look up the meaning of the word.)</TE>
<TE>   Roadside wonders: As if driving around here weren't adventurous
enough, Richard Hoffman of Manhattan Beach found a pair of signs
arguing over the legality -- indeed, the necessity! -- of making a
left turn (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Laying down the law: "Somebody has to work!" Marvin Wolf of
Beverly Hills said of one business that has a job opening (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   The devil you say: In this uncertain economy, it's a heckuva time
to start a business, especially one with the name taken by a San
Fernando Valley company (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Some baseball, some of the time: All-news station KFWB-AM (980)
will start broadcasting Dodger games next year, and it's been trying
to drum up excitement by having celebrities recall favorite Dodger
moments.</TE>
<TE>   Problem is, the team hasn't won a playoff game since last century
(1988, to be precise). So a lot of the spots mention long-gone
oldsters like Kirk Gibson and Fernando Valenzuela -- not all from the
world of sports.</TE>
<TE>   My colleague Patt Morrison was asked for her top Dodger memory and
said it was the visit of Pope John Paul II to the stadium in 1987. In
her spot, Morrison fondly recalled that the pontiff did a "victory
lap" around the field in his Popemobile.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The Dodgers just don't seem to have it together yet.
Season ticket-holder Michael Horowicz said he visited the stadium
gift shop the other day and noticed that the T in the giant "THINK
BLUE" sign on the nearby hillside had blown down.</TE>

<KH>ON THE LAW</KH>
<HD>A Lesson in Culture Shock for Lawyers</HD>
<DH>International attorneys seek to hone U.S. law skills at
USC. But the demands and informality can be intimidating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K. Connie Kang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than anything, what surprised Tokyo lawyer Michi Yamagami about
American education was the informality of the classroom and the
interaction between teachers and students.</LD>
<LD>   In Japan, professors lecture and students listen, said Yamagami, a
master of laws candidate at USC Law School. But here they exchange
ideas as if they're equals, he observed, and professors have a knack
for calling on students.</LD>
<LD>   "The first time I was called, I was very, very nervous," said
Yamagami, a graduate of the prestigious University of Tokyo who
passed the demanding Japanese bar exam on his first try -- a mark of
great distinction. Japan has fewer than 19,000 attorneys, compared to
more than 1 million in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   Fortunately, Yamagami said, he was prepared for the professor's
first question. But he became flustered when the professor continued
with follow-ups, with each query becoming more specific. Aferall, he
said, culturally, that's an uncomfortable thing for an East Asian.</TE>
<TE>   Yamagami and 11 other lawyers are participating in USC's inaugural
LLM program for attorneys with foreign law degrees. And Yamagami, an
up-and-coming associate at the firm of Anderson Mori in Tokyo, and
the others are getting a workout.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers, whom USC Law School Dean Matthew L. Spitzer describes
as "the best and the brightest," are receiving intensive training in
American jurisprudence and the its legal system.</TE>
<TE>   The dozen lawyers take an Introduction to U.S. Law class together
and are otherwise free to take courses with students in the regular
USC law degree program.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to four from Japan, class members hail from India,
South Korea, Taiwan, Pakistan, France, Germany and Great Britain.
Many are focusing on courses in entertainment law and intellectual
property.</TE>
<TE>   Navigating the international zone is a two-way street.</TE>
<TE>   Professor David Slawson, who teaches contract and insurance law,
experienced it the first time he called on a student.</TE>
<TE>   Although he already had a law degree, the student was "practically
paralyzed with fear," Slawson recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the professor has gone out of his way to be "extra
gentle" with them, but he does not excuse them from impromptu
questioning because he considers that an essential part of the
training.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to be a lawyer, you're going to have to withstand
a lot worse pressure," he said. "So, this is a way to break them into
the real world."</TE>
<TE>   Like Yamagami, Hiromi Shiraishi, who hopes to work as a specialist
in international transactions, had her baptism by fire when one of
her professors asked her a question.</TE>
<TE>   Shiraishi had prepared for class, but did not expect to be called
on. When she was, her mind went blank, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "To answer in English or explain myself in front of a native
speaker is so embarrassing," said Shiraishi, a third-year associate
at Asahi Law Offices, the fifth-largest law firm in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   With Piyush Sharma, an attorney with the New Delhi law firm of
Bhasin &amp; Bhasin who earned his law degree at the University of Wales,
his concern was that American professors might have trouble
understanding his accent.</TE>
<TE>   So, he made his rounds and asked them, "Is my accent OK by you?"</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to take a class without the professor being
comfortable with me in the accent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But it's more than language or accent that challenges the foreign
students.</TE>
<TE>   English is London-born Manbir S. Chowdhary's first language.
Still, the graduate of the University of Buckingham has experienced a
cultural surprise -- albeit a pleasant one -- in the way professors
and students interact here.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say that [professors in Britain] weren't approachable
-- they were -- but students feared them anyway," said Chowdhary, a
British citizen whose ancestors came from India.</TE>
<TE>   "But here in the United States, professors are extremely
accessible and really go out of their way to help the students out.
It's very welcome."</TE>
<TE>   Foreign lawyers contribute to the life of the law school and the
university overall.</TE>
<TE>   "Our law students learn to understand that their view of the legal
education is not the only view that there is, but there are many
other systems that approach the world in very different ways," said
Edwin M. Smith, who teaches the Introduction to U.S. Law course.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, more than 30 law schools offer similar master's
programs, USC officials said. USC's is unusual in its small size and
disproportionate enrollment of Asian students, which partly stems
from the university's long-standing connection to that part of the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Spitzer flew to Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea and
visited large law firms to recruit students.</TE>
<TE>   His pitch: With the world's economies becoming more integrated --
and interaction among countries increasing in areas such as
intellectual property, commercial transactions and human rights --
lawyers can gain a competitive advantage by understanding the
American legal system.</TE>
<TE>   Motoi Fujii, and Chikako Morimoto, who are married to each other,
represent a new breed of Japanese lawyers who hope to move with ease
in both legal worlds.</TE>
<TE>   Their employer, TMI Associates, considers their U.S. training
important enough to subsidize all their expenses while they complete
their studies and through practical training they hope to do for a
year after earning their American law degrees. Tuition for the USC
program is $32,500 a year.</TE>
<TE>   With just one lawyer for every 6,737 people in Japan, compared
with one for every 274 in the United States, there is a big demand
for lawyers of all types, but especially those with specialized
skills, lawyer groups say.</TE>
<TE>   What's driving it is the growing internationalization of the
Japanese economy and complex transactions that are based on U.S.
laws, lawyers from Japan said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our law firm has foreign clients, so we have to be proficient in
English," said Fujii.</TE>
<TE>   After nearly a semester, he understands about half of what's going
on in the classroom, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "In my tax class, sometimes students are laughing but I am not,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fujii says he jots down words and phrases he doesn't understand
and looks them up after class.</TE>
<TE>   He says he still isn't used to the freedom American students
exercise to ask questions in the classroom. He rarely asks questions
because of his cultural inhibition.</TE>
<TE>   "Asking questions means you are taking up other people's time," he
said. "So, if I am going to ask a question, I must make sure it is a
good question and that I won't impose on other students' time without
a good reason."</TE>
<TE>   Students from abroad not only work hard, but they also are very
courteous, said Slawson. "Up until two weeks ago, I had one of them
-- I won't name him -- who would thank me after every class. It kind
of threw me."</TE>

<LD>Painful. Intrusive. Unseemly.</LD>
<LD>   Yet perversely fascinating.</LD>
<LD>   Hearing about life inside the Machnick household in Yorba Linda,
where the parents' psychological war with their rebellious son now
has them awaiting a jury verdict, was all those things.</LD>
<TE>   It certainly wasn't entertaining -- unless you get your jollies
from other people's miseries.</TE>
<TE>   The key elements in the child-abuse case against Grady and Deborah
Machnick: They kept their junior-high-age son out on the patio
overnight at least 10 times; Deborah once put dog feces in his school
backpack; she photographed him clad only in his socks; they awakened
him dozens of times at 4 a.m. on school days.</TE>
<TE>   I had lunch this week with a friend (and father of four) who knows
those broad outlines of the case.</TE>
<TE>   He said he didn't need details: They're guilty, he says, because
of the psychological damage it must have done to the boy, who was 14
when he left home for good last year and moved in with friends
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it will be that simple for the jury, which has begun
deliberations as I'm writing this. Somehow, I doubt it.</TE>
<TE>   It's the particular fascination of this case -- and the questions
it raises about raising children -- that tempt me to predict that the
Machnicks will beat the rap.</TE>
<TE>   They're charged with misdemeanor child abuse, stemming from the
ongoing series of alleged incidents, and a felony count of conspiring
to commit child abuse. I'll bet prosecutor Pete Pierce a nickel he
won't get a guilty verdict on the felony count.</TE>
<TE>   I won't hazard a guess on the misdemeanor count, but it wouldn't
surprise me to see a deadlocked jury, with later reports of heated
deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   Shocking as that would be to my lunch pal, defense attorneys Sal
Ciulla and John Barnett (representing stepmother and father,
respectively) masterfully framed their closing arguments in ways that
likely will have jurors debating both law and real life.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett went first, referring to Machnick's 25-year career in law
enforcement and his job as a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department
jail supervisor. So fearful was Machnick that his son -- described by
Barnett and Ciulla as a habitual liar, thief and slacker -- would end
up in jail that he and his wife went to unusual lengths to rein in
his behavior before it was too late. Nothing worked, Barnett argued,
and the tougher disciplinary techniques ensued.</TE>
<TE>   During his two-hour argument, Barnett referred to the couple's son
(who was between 12 and 14 during the period in question) as "a train
wreck," "as cold, as calculated a liar as you will ever see" and "a
very dark, dangerous boy."</TE>
<TE>   Ciulla followed Barnett to the lectern and, I think, also scored
points. Referring to Deborah's decision to put the dog feces in her
stepson's backpack, Ciulla said jurors might grade that an F as a
parenting technique. "But it's not a crime," he argued. "You don't
get arrested for it. Did [the prosecutor] prove [the Machnick's son]
was emotionally affected by it? No. To [the boy], it was the same as
no TV. It just didn't matter."</TE>
<TE>   Barnett expressed indignation that the Machnicks risk a felony
conviction. More than once over the years, I've written critically of
the Orange County D.A.'s office for overzealous prosecution, but no
such gripe this time.</TE>
<TE>   Although Pierce minimized a number of allegations that lost steam
during the trial, enough of the case remains to make the Machnicks'
behavior fair game for scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   As you can probably tell, this is a verdict I can't wait for -- if
only to see if the jurors see parenting the way my lunch pal does.</TE>

<HD>Jack Speirs, 86; Wrote Scripts, Introductions for Disney TV
Shows</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack Speirs, who in his 25-year association with Walt Disney Studios
wrote lead-ins that were used to introduce television shows,
including "Disneyland" and "Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color,"
has died.</LD>
<LD>   Speirs, who was 86, died of natural causes Nov. 29 at his home in
Lake Sherwood.</LD>
<LD>   Speirs also wrote dozens of animal-oriented scripts for Disney
television and feature films, including "Charlie, the Lonesome
Cougar" and "King of the Grizzlies," and the narration for "The Bears
and I."</LD>
<TE>   He was writer and producer for "A Tale of Two Crit- ters."</TE>
<TE>   Speirs, who was born in Coxs Mills, W.Va., and had an eighth-grade
education, began writing in radio as a staff writer for "I Fly
Anything," "Defense Attorney" and other shows.</TE>
<TE>   He found his way to Disney during the 1950s, and in 1954
approached Walt Disney with an idea to split the format of a proposed
TV series into segments spotlighting the four primary realms of the
soon-to-open Disneyland: Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland and
Tomorrowland. Disney liked the idea, and Speirs went on to write the
show's introductions for the next 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   "The secret in writing for [Disney] was to keep the dialogue
simple and in character," Speirs once said.</TE>
<TE>   "He seldom used fancy or uncommon words but wouldn't talk down to
his viewers either."</TE>
<TE>   Speirs also wrote lyrics for many Disney films and for "The
Nashville Coyote" television show.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 62 years, Hazel.</TE>

<HD>Allan Frumkin, 75; Founded Art Galleries in Chicago, New
York</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allan Frumkin, an art dealer who introduced leading Surrealists
Joseph Cornell and Roberto Sebastian Matta to the Midwest in solo
exhibits at his Chicago gallery, died Monday at 75. He had closed
that gallery two decades ago and retired in the mid-1990s from a
second gallery he founded in New York City, where he lived for many
years.</LD>
<LD>   Frumkin was recently hospitalized in New York for complications
from Crohn's disease.</LD>
<LD>   His eclectic taste swept across art movements as diverse as
Postimpressionism, German Expressionism, funk and lyrical
abstraction. In his 50 years as an art dealer he promoted the work of
Henri Matisse, Max Beckmann, Robert Arneson and Richard Diebenkorn,
among others.</LD>
<TE>   He also built his own private art collection. Earlier this month
he donated his holdings of Beckmann prints to the St. Louis Art
Museum.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Chicago, Frumkin graduated from the University of
Chicago then traveled through Western Europe to learn firsthand about
contemporary art. He met Henry Moore, Alberto Giacometti and Matta
and decided to start a gallery for contemporary art in his hometown.</TE>
<TE>   The Allan Frumkin Gallery opened in Chicago in 1952. Seven years
later Frumkin added a New York counterpart by the same name. He
closed the first gallery in 1980 and retired from the latter in 1995
but continued to work as a private art dealer for most of the rest of
his life.</TE>
<TE>   Frumkin is survived by his wife, Jean, a sister, two sons and
three grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Playa Vista Views Shared</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martha Groves</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Preachers, wetlands activists, construction workers and retired
residents lined up Thursday to air their opinions as city planners
held their first public hearing on Playa Vista's next and final phase
of development.</LD>
<LD>   The comments indicated that although the large Westside project
has gained some community support, it still faces fierce opposition
from activists and neighbors concerned about traffic, pollution and
disappearing open space.</LD>
<LD>   Seated at the front of a meeting room at the Furama Hotel in
Westchester, Sue Chang of the Los Angeles Planning Department
listened patiently as three dozen supporters and opponents spoke for
about three minutes each.</LD>
<TE>   The occasion was the first of two so-called scoping meetings,
designed to offer interested parties a chance to suggest issues that
they believe should be evaluated in the environmental-impact report
that will be prepared for the project, known as the Village at Playa
Vista.</TE>
<TE>   Setting a calm tone as the two-hour meeting began, Chang reminded
the audience that no decisions would be made at that session.</TE>
<TE>   "This is only to hear your concerns," she said, adding that the
comments would help shape the draft environmental-impact report,
which is expected to be completed after a 60-day comment period
ending Jan. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Playa Vista described to city planners its proposal
for what Playa Vista President Steve Soboroff called a "smaller,
greener" development. The Phase 2 portion, which lies along Jefferson
Boulevard at the core of the Playa Vista property, would include
2,600 homes as well as retail shops and restaurants in a 162-acre
area.</TE>
<TE>   That area lies between apartments, condos and single-family homes
under construction at the corner of Lincoln and Jefferson boulevards.
With Phases 1and 2 combined, the project would have 55% less housing,
than the originally proposed 13,000 units. It would also cut retail
space by 70%, to 185,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   The plans also formalized Playa Vista's intention not to build on
any of its land west of Lincoln Boulevard, in anticipation that it
will sell that acreage to the state to be preserved as wetlands and
open space.</TE>
<TE>   Many speakers Thursday praised Playa Vista for bringing jobs and
housing to the area.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the last chance in the West L.A. area to have a planned
community that meets many of the needs ... while preserving the
environment," said one Marina del Rey resident.</TE>
<TE>   But opponent Steve Friedman of Venice contended that the project
has already done great damage to the area.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an unsightly mess, with dense, block-like buildings that
look like an inner-city housing project," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Speakers urged the city to consider in its environmental review
everything from traffic flow to water runoff to bike paths to what
would happen to displaced rodents once construction begins on Phase
2.</TE>
<TE>   Marcia Hanscom, executive director of the Wetlands Action Network,
asked how Playa Vista intended to meet the school needs of more
residents when it has not yet addressed them for Phase 1.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Gleberman, president of the Westchester-LAX-Marina del Rey
Chamber of Commerce, praised Playa Vista for taking what he called "a
balanced approach" of preserving open space while building much
needed housing.</TE>

<HD>Santa Cruz Deputizes Couple in U.S. Pot Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Bailey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Santa Cruz couple backed by civic leaders after federal drug agents
busted their medical marijuana operation have earned a new
distinction. They've been named city deputies.</LD>
<LD>   In a direct affront to the federal government, the City Council
voted unanimously this week to deputize Mike and Valerie Corral,
co-founders of the Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana, and
authorized them under city law to cultivate, distribute and possess
marijuana for medicinal purposes.</LD>
<LD>   "We're just trying to give them a little bit more support and
legitimacy," Vice Mayor Scott Kennedy said Thursday. "We don't
support drug trafficking. We don't support marijuana. But we do
support what they're doing for the terminally ill and terribly
suffering."</LD>
<TE>   U.S. Drug Enforcement agents in September raided the couple's
medical marijuana dispensary, which distributes pot to about 200
patients. No charges have been filed against the Corrals.</TE>
<TE>   Outraged city officials in the Northern California seaside town,
long a hotbed of the medical marijuana movement, threw their support
behind the Corrals. The city received national attention when the
council hosted a medical marijuana distribution ceremony Sept. 17 on
the steps of Santa Cruz City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Federal drug officials say the couple's new status in the eyes of
the Santa Cruz council does nothing to change the glaring conflict
between U.S. law, which considers marijuana illegal under all
circumstances, and California's 1996 approval of pot as medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "If this is being done to circumvent federal law, it certainly
won't work," said Richard Meyer, a Drug Enforcement Administration
spokesman in San Francisco. "The U.S. government hasn't changed the
law on marijuana. It's still illegal to cultivate or distribute it."</TE>
<TE>   Though unusual, the deputizing of the Corrals is not unique. One
medical marijuana provider has been deputized in Oakland, and two in
San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   But the couple, who did not return calls for comment, face greater
difficulties because of the Sept. 5 raid on their dispensary. City
officials remain concerned that the U.S. attorney could still file
charges or attempt to shut down the alliance through the civil
courts.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy said the Corrals stand apart from other medical marijuana
providers in Santa Cruz because their program has taken greater pains
to cater only to the very ill who come bearing recommendations from
doctors.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very conscientious, very impressive in terms of their
integrity," he said. "They enjoy a high level of confidence, both in
the medical and law enforcement community, which can't be said about
any of the other medical marijuana distributors."</TE>
<TE>   But city officials worry most about the patients, Kennedy said,
and the possibility that they would be stripped of needed medicinal
relief if the dispensary were shut down.</TE>
<TE>   "While the DEA equates them to a drug cartel, I think they're more
comparable to a pharmacy," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   The Corrals are still attempting to retrieve 167 plants that
agents seized from their medical marijuana garden near Davenport, a
coastal town a few miles northwest of Santa Cruz. The city has agreed
to join the couple in a civil suit against the federal government in
the aftermath of the raid.</TE>
<TE>   With their new status as deputies, the Corrals hope they will be
afforded the same sort of protection under federal law that allows a
city police officer to legally carry and sell drugs while engaged in
a drug sting. Their twist on that U.S. statute is that the couple
would be upholding state and local laws that allow for medical
marijuana. The legal strategy has not been tested in federal court.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy said the council's decision to deputize the couple is
largely symbolic, but it ratchets up the "contest of wills" between
Santa Cruz and the federal government over the fate of the Corrals.
"We're serious about this," he said. "I think it raises the ante."</TE>

<HD>Inmate Shot, Dozens Injured in Folsom Riot</HD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A race-related riot involving more than 100 inmates at Folsom State
Prison on Thursday left two convicts with serious wounds -- one
inflicted by a guard's gunshot -- and dozens with minor injuries.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first time in almost two years that an inmate has been
shot in a California prison. No staff members were injured in the
riot, described as the worst in a decade at the medium-security
prison housing about 3,600 inmates east of Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   Corrections officials ordered the prison placed on lockdown
status, meaning all inmates must remain in their cells, losing most
privileges, until an investigation is completed. The riot involved
blacks and Latinos and began shortly before 7 a.m. in a housing unit.
Guards quickly contained that brawl by firing rubber bullets, one of
which struck an inmate just below an eye, said a prison spokesman.</LD>
<TE>   About 20 minutes later, more than 100 inmates in the dining hall
began fighting. When pepper spray and rubber bulletsfailed to quell
the riot, a correctional officer fired a single shot from a
high-powered rifle, striking an inmate in the hip area, corrections
officials said. At that point, the rioting, which lasted more than
five minutes, stopped.</TE>

<HD>High School Boys Held in UCLA Dorm Sex Assault</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A UCLA student was sexually assaulted in her dormitory by Carson High
School students who broke off from a field trip and entered her room,
campus police said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The assault occurred about 11 a.m. on Dec. 5, according to UCLA
police.</LD>
<LD>   Officers arrested three students, who are juveniles, the following
day, using descriptions given by the victim and other witnesses.</LD>
<TE>   Campus police said only that the woman was sexually assaulted and
would not elaborate. The male suspects were not identified. UCLA
police spokeswoman Nancy Greenstein would not say where the youths
were being held.</TE>
<TE>   Dorm residents enter the dormitories by using encoded
identification cards, but someone probably let the high school
students in, Greenstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Miguel Banuelos of the UCLA police said campus patrols have
been increased as a result of the attack. He said he didn't know
whether the suspects are in juvenile hall or had been released in
their parents' custody.</TE>

<HD>Group Sues to Block Lopez Recall Election</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Yi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Latino rights organization sued Thursday to block the recall
election of a Santa Ana school board member, contending that
petitions aimed at ousting him for his alleged advocacy of bilingual
education were circulated only in English in the heavily Latino city.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational
Fund allege that the Orange County registrar of voters violated the
rights of non-English-speaking residents by approving the petitions
in only one language.</LD>
<LD>   Recall supporters circulated petitions to recall trustee Nativo V.
Lopez this year in Santa Ana, where about three-quarters of the
population speaks Spanish. The registrar determined they had
submitted enough valid signatures to put the question to voters.</LD>
<TE>   A special election is set for Feb. 4.</TE>
<TE>   "By failing to provide recall petition materials in Spanish,
Orange County is, in effect, telling Spanish-speaking Latinos and
other persons not proficient in English that they aren't welcome to
participate in certain critical portions of the political process,"
lawyer Steven Reyes said. "It goes beyond just the recall of Mr.
Lopez."</TE>
<TE>   The federal Voting Rights Act calls for voting materials to be
provided in languages other than English in communities with
significant numbers of non-English speakers. But it wasn't clear
Thursday whether that includes petitions circulated by citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very interesting use of the law," said Morgan Kousser, a
Caltech history professor and author of "Color Blind Injustice," a
book on the history of voting rights.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Registrar of Voters Rosalyn Lever could not be
reached for comment Thursday, but recall backers in the
62,000-student Santa Ana Unified School District reacted with anger
and disbelief.</TE>
<TE>   "It is another heavy-handed tactic to try and stop the
inevitable," said Vivian Martinez, a district parent who filed for
the recall with other parents and citizens. "Let the voters decide
and leave it at that."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, who is a candidate in the February election to replace
Lopez, said recall organizers did not circulate petitions in Spanish
because they were not told it was necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Whitacre, another recall supporter, said simply: "English is
our primary language."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said he is fighting for the rights of those who may not be
fluent in English.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why we have the Voting Rights Act," he said Thursday of
the MALDEF suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. "To
protect secondary languages and to ensure the rights of U.S. citizens
and voters whose primary language is not English."</TE>

<HD>Sonny Reizner, 81; Bookmaker of Exotic Bets, Like 'Who Shot
J.R.?'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He was the dean of Las Vegas sports bookmakers, a onetime
professional gambler who started the first football handicapping
contest and helped popularize teasers, propositions and other exotic
wagers.</LD>
<LD>   Sonny Reizner, who gained international notoriety in 1980 for
booking bets on "Who shot J.R.?," died of Parkinson's disease Nov. 30
in a Las Vegas care center. He was 81.</LD>
<LD>   As sports book director of Hole-in-the-Wall Sportsbook at the
now-defunct Castaways Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip from
1976 to 1987, Reizner launched Nevada's first football contest -- the
"Castaways Challenge," started in 1978, which offered large purses to
handicappers with the best season's win records.</LD>
<TE>   A year later, he went even further by offering the "Ultimate
Challenge," a contest with a $5,000 entry fee.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the usual football, baseball and basketball betting
lines, Reizner established the first betting line on the Boston
Marathon in 1979, and he was among the first to take wagers on other
nontraditional betting sports such as NASCAR races, golf and tennis.</TE>
<TE>   "He brought sports betting into the modern age," said Larry
Grossman, a friend of Reizner and host of a Las Vegas radio show
devoted to gambling, "You Can Bet on It."</TE>
<TE>   Reizner also became known for his innovative proposition wagers in
which handicappers could bet on everything from whether there would
be a no-hitter pitched in a baseball game that day to whether a Super
Bowl coin toss would turn up heads or tails.</TE>
<TE>   But Reizner was unprepared for the response he generated in 1980
when he posted the betting line asking, "Who shot J.R.?"</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of fans of the TV series "Dallas" placed wagers on who
they thought was the unknown assailant who had shot the unscrupulous
Texas oilman J.R. Ewing, played by Larry Hagman, in the previous
season's cliffhanger.</TE>
<TE>   Reizner wrote the odds for every character on the show who had a
reason to kill J.R. Always one to inject humor into the proceedings,
he even gave odds on real people, such as Dallas Cowboys coach Tom
Landry at 500 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   "It caused such a frenzy," Grossman said. "He had no idea it was
going to be like that. He put up these kinds of things all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Bookmakers, Grossman said, "used to put up lines on everything
from elections to who's going to win the National League MVP. I
remember a line asking where the comet Kohoutek is going to land."</TE>
<TE>   All that changed in the wake of Reizner's "Dallas"-inspired
betting line.</TE>
<TE>   Before the episode that revealed who shot J.R. aired in the fall
of 1980, Nevada's Gambling Control Board ordered that the line be
taken down and all bets refunded.</TE>
<TE>   The board reasoned that the shooter had already been determined by
"Dallas" and that people who worked on the show may have talked.</TE>
<TE>   From then on, Nevada's licensed books could take wagers only on
sporting events.</TE>
<TE>   "The person who pulled the trigger turned out to be the sister of
J.R.'s wife," Reizner said later, "and she was my 7-to-2 fourth
choice in the odds."</TE>
<TE>   Born Julius Charles Reizner in Taunton, Mass., in 1921, he fell in
love with sports as a child. He placed his first bet with a bookie --
on the Boston Braves -- when he was 16.</TE>
<TE>   While working in the Sears mail order warehouse in Brookline,
Mass., at 17, he supplemented his $15-a-week earnings by betting on
sports and backing top local pool players.</TE>
<TE>   After serving in the Army Air Corps during World War II -- "When I
went into the service, the Germans became an 8-to-5 favorite," he
would joke -- he turned to full-time gambling.</TE>
<TE>   "He and Mother owned an antique store in Framingham [Mass.], but
he made his living as a professional gambler on sporting events,"
said Reizner's daughter, Jann Reizner, a retired Las Vegas teacher.</TE>
<TE>   She remembers the many times her father would be preoccupied
watching a game, talking on the phone or simply worrying about a bet.</TE>
<TE>   One time in the 1960s, he had $100,000 riding on the outcome of a
single World Series game. He lost.</TE>
<TE>   "We were never poor or hurting for anything, but there was a lot
of stress on his part to provide for a wife and four kids," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The family moved to Las Vegas in 1970. Reizner went to work at the
now-defunct Churchill Downs Race and Sports Book.</TE>
<TE>   He worked at the Fremont and Stardust before he was hired by the
Castaways Hole-in-the-Wall Sportsbook in 1976. After the Castaways
was demolished in 1987 to make way for the Mirage, Reizner became
director of the Frontier hotel's race and sports book.</TE>
<TE>   Reizner, who taught a course on the history of sports betting at
the University of Nevada-Las Vegas for three years, helped open the
Rio's race and sports book in 1989 and served as its director for
several years before taking over the same job at the Desert Inn. He
retired in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his daughter, Reizner is survived by his wife,
Rolene; sons Adam of Las Vegas and Alan of Austin, Texas; daughter
Gale Levine of Hopkinton, Mass.; and five grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>Lawyers at Consumer Enforcement Watch say they are fighting for
countless Californians who have been ripped off by auto mechanics.
The Santa Ana-based nonprofit group has sued nearly 2,000 garages for
allegedly padding bills, using secondhand parts and failing to
provide customers written estimates.</LD>
<LD>   But the auto repair industry insists it is being scammed by
attorneys seeking big legal payouts for bogus claims.</LD>
<LD>   The civil suits, filed over the last few months, target 5% of all
auto repair shops in California. Beverly Hills attorney Damian Trevor
said the shops have a history of unfair business practices and have,
at one time or another, been reprimanded by the state's Bureau of
Automotive Repair. Each suit cites violations noted in state records.</LD>
<TE>   "The public is tired of getting scammed," Trevor said. "We're
telling these bad shops that the buck stops here."</TE>
<TE>   Shop owners and trade groups said Consumer Enforcement Watch was
created just months ago for the sole purpose of winning settlements
and attorneys fees for a group of young lawyers. "Basically what
they're doing is a shakedown of small businesses in Southern
California," said Will Woods, executive director of the Automotive
Trade Organizations of California. "They don't represent
customers.... They're bloodsuckers."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, more than 50 mechanics picketed in front of Trevor's
Santa Monica Boulevard law office to protest the lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The suits have been filed under the state's Unfair Competition
Act, which forbids such practices as false advertising and price
fixing. The act permits people to sue businesses even if the
plaintiffs have not been personally victimized.</TE>
<TE>   The law has long been the subject of debate in Sacramento.
Proponents say it protects consumers by allowing them to sue
companies they believe are guilty of unfair business practices.
Critics, however, say the law has been hijacked by profit-seeking
lawyers and should be altered to make filing suits more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Business groups such as the California Chamber of Commerce have
tried for years to weaken the law to make it harder for suits to move
forward. But their efforts have been thwarted by trial lawyers, who
have lobbied to keep the existing laws.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Robert Pacheco (R-Walnut) introduced a bill this year
that would have significantly altered the unfair-competition law by
banning repetitive lawsuits and requiring that plaintiffs suffer some
palpable harm. But the bill never made it out of the Assembly
Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Auto repair shops started being hit with the civil lawsuits in
April.</TE>
<TE>   Defendants contend that shortly after they are named in the
lawsuits, they receive calls from Trevor and fellow lawyers urging
them to settle out of court. The payments, which include attorney
fees and funds for the operation of Consumer Enforcement Watch, have
ranged from $1,700 to $25,000. Trevor said that so far, 600 shop
owners have agreed to settle.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave them $2,000 just so they would get out of my face," said
Gary Balikji, owner of a garage in Stanton that was accused of not
keeping accurate paperwork. Balikji said he decided to settle after
his lawyer told him it could cost as much as $10,000 to defend a case
in court.</TE>
<TE>   "It's complete robbery, but I don't have the time to deal with
it," he said. "I'm too busy to go to court."</TE>

an example a mechanic who allegedly took parts from a new
Mercedes-Benz and replaced them with older parts.</TE>

violations alleged in the suits are minor, such as failing to renew
businesses licenses on time, failing to record an odometer's mileage
and other clerical errors.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County district attorney sent Trevor's law firm a
letter warning it not to link its lawsuits with any actions by
prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Industry trade groups are urging shop owners not to settle.
Instead, they hope to fight the matter in court and are considering a
special ballot measure that would alter the state's Unfair
Competition Law.</TE>
<TE>   Trevor said it would be a mistake to alter the law.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers are thankful for it," he said. "There aren't enough
checks and measures by the state of California to take care of this
problem. We're the ones trying to protect the public."</TE>

<LD>Finding themselves on the defensive after investigators discovered a
highly toxic chemical in Simi Valley and at Ahmanson Ranch, officials
with defense contractor Rocketdyne said Thursday that their test site
in the Santa Susana Mountains is not responsible.</LD>
<LD>   During a media briefing at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory -- a
nuclear testing ground in the 1950s -- Rocketdyne scientists said
years of research into the soil, water and geology of the hilltop
site between Simi Valley and Chatsworth show that the chemical
perchlorate could not have traveled to the valley floor.</LD>
<LD>   Their statement came in response to the discovery by state
investigators of the chemical in 18 shallow wells scattered across
Simi Valley. Perchlorate, a component of rocket fuel, can cause
thyroid dysfunction in humans.</LD>
<TE>   None of the affected monitoring wells provides drinking water to
valley residents.</TE>
<TE>   "Scientifically, you would see some type of a trace or
fingerprint, and it's just not there," said engineer Richard
Andrachek, who works with Rocketdyne scientists to measure and
monitor contamination at the 2,800-acre site.</TE>
<TE>   The highest concentration found in Simi Valley was 20 parts per
billion. Any level above 4 parts per billion is considered dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   The recent discovery by state investigators coincides with a
finding of trace amounts of perchlorate in a well at nearby Ahmanson
Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are several "hot spots" of perchlorate
contamination in the soil and water at the field lab, data do not
support critics' theory that perchlorate passed from the site to the
valley via streams and springs, Rocketdyne officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Experts with the state Department of Toxic Substances Control,
which performed the Simi Valley studies, agree that the evidence does
not point to Rocketdyne.</TE>
<TE>   If the chemical had come from the Santa Susana site, trace amounts
would have been found in the soil and bedrock surrounding the lab,
said Gerard Abrams, a state geologist who oversaw the well studies.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't able to find any connection to the activities at
Rocketdyne," Abrams said Wednesday night during a public meeting in
Simi Valley to discuss contamination cleanup at the site. "If surface
release was the source of contamination, there would have to have
been an awful lot of perchlorate that moved down the drainage, and
it's not there today. I don't see how that can be."</TE>
<TE>   Geological maps of the area show there is no direct drainage
system to the Ahmanson well, which is three miles from the nearest
Santa Susana well known to contain perchlorate.</TE>
<TE>   However, Ali Tabidian, a professor of hydrogeology at Cal State
Northridge who has studied the area for more than a decade, theorizes
that the substance was carried down the mountain from Rocketdyne by
water trickling through natural drainage systems.</TE>
<TE>   He presented his theory at the meeting Wednesday night, ending his
remarks by saying, "Based on the data, there is no reason to believe
the source is anywhere but the Santa Susana Field Laboratory."</TE>
<TE>   Rocketdyne officials suggest a former plant nursery on Ahmanson
Ranch may have been the source of the perchlorate there. The chemical
is an ingredient of a fertilizer imported from Chile that may have
been used at the nursery, they said.</TE>

<TE>   Although there are several "hot spots" of perchlorate

in the most extreme case -- data do not support critics' theory that

is an ingredient of a fertilizer imported from Chile that may have

<TE>   That particular type of fertilizer may also have contributed to
the perchlorate found in the ground water in Simi Valley, said Art
Lenox, a Rocketdyne scientist in charge of cleanup at the site. In
addition, fireworks and road flares contain enough potassium
perchlorate to trigger the findings, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rocketdyne officials also pointed out that a major part of the
rocket testing done at Santa Susana since the 1940s involved liquid
fuels, not perchlorate-based fuels.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford Lovett, a 10-year resident of Simi Valley who suffers
from Graves disease, which attacks the thyroid gland, said he is fed
up with the theories of dueling scientists and bickering government
agencies. He says he wants some answers -- something he found in
short supply at the Wednesday night meeting sponsored by the federal
Environmental Protection Agency.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole thing was so whitewashed," Lovett said. "I feel like
no one's working for the people."</TE>

<LD>The city of Lancaster has hired former Republican Assemblyman George
Runner as a special assistant to City Manager James Gilley.</LD>
<LD>   Runner, 50, recently left the 36th Assembly District due to term
limits. The seat was filled by his wife, Sharon.</LD>
<LD>   Runner, who was mayor of Lancaster from 1995 to 1996, will be paid

<LD>The California Coastal Commission recommended Thursday that the Morro
Bay power plant be cooled with air, not seawater, when it is
remodeled.</LD>
<LD>   The commission said pumping seawater through and returning it to
the ocean would harm sea life. The matter now goes to the California
Energy Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Duke Energy, which wants to modernize the aging plant, says air
cooling is not feasible. The huge fans required would violate noise
ordinances, a spokesman said, and the plant already uses seawater for
cooling.</LD>

<LD>The state Department of Fish and Game is expected to release its
findings next week on a huge Klamath River fish kill.</LD>
<LD>   The report, to be released Monday, is expected to explain what
caused the deaths of at least 33,000 Chinook and coho salmon,
steelhead and sturgeon in September.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities speculated that a U.S. Bureau of Reclamation reduction
in water flowing into the river triggered the disaster by squeezing
too many fish into too little water. The close quarters apparently
may have allowed two diseases to spread quickly.</LD>

<HD>Water Board Targets Ocean Bacteria</HD>
<DH>State rules crack down on rainy-day pollution in Santa
Monica Bay. Foes say the low level of beach use in wet weather
doesn't justify the cost.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth R. Weiss</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State water officials on Thursday took their first step toward
controlling unhealthful levels of bacteria that are flushed into
Santa Monica Bay after heavy rainstorms.</LD>
<LD>   The new rules cover 44 beaches that stretch from the Los
Angeles-Ventura County line to Outer Cabrillo Beach south of Palos
Verdes Peninsula.</LD>
<LD>   The regulations give local government officials 10 to 18 years to
reduce the number of days that water-borne bacteria can exceed human
health standards in waters near shore.</LD>
<TE>   Bacteria in the ocean from urban runoff, pet droppings and leaking
sewage pipelines have caused stomach and respiratory ailments.</TE>
<TE>   "Banning bacteria is the most important thing that we've done to
protect human health," said Francine Diamond, chairwoman of the Los
Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board. "This will help future
generations as they go to the beach, protecting the health of
children, swimmers and surfers who come in contact with the water."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, state officials ordered cities and the county
to clean up bacterial pollution during rain-free days in Santa Monica
Bay so that all of its beaches are safe during the most popular
months for swimming. Cities have three years to meet these
dry-weather standards.</TE>
<TE>   The rules adopted Thursday by the regional board tackle the
tougher problem of diverting or treating the bacteria swept into the
ocean during rainy days.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists said the new bacterial standards should be
especially helpful in protecting the health of surfers, bodysurfers
and knee-boarders who are drawn to the same storm-driven surf that
catches the most polluted runoff.</TE>
<TE>   Opposing the rules, the Coalition for Practical Regulation,
representing a number of coastal cities, argued that too few people
enter the ocean on such days to justify the cleanup cost.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Hobbs, a coalition spokesman, said state officials have
failed to do a cost-benefit analysis that proves the need for such
expensive regulations. "The state is not paying for this. The local
taxpayers are," Hobbs said. "We think these regulations should be in
the best interest of the public, not just on some environmentalists'
agenda."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Gold, executive director of the environmental group Heal the
Bay, said all members of the public deserve health protections
guaranteed 30 years ago by the U.S. Clean Water Act. "The die-hards
who swim or surf during the winter deserve just as much protection as
those who go in the ocean during the summer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The crackdown on bacterial pollution is part of a larger campaign
against an array of pollutants outlined in the settlement of a
lawsuit filed by environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   In addressing limits on bacterial pollution, the regional board
decided against setting an absolute threshold that could not be
breached, noting that suspect bacteria does not always come from
human sewage or other man-made causes. Instead, bird droppings and
wildlife waste and even rotting vegetation can elevate levels of
harmful bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   For most areas north of Los Angeles, health standards for bacteria
can be exceeded a maximum of 17 days during wet weather each year.
Other beaches, particularly the cleaner ones in the South Bay, will
be allowed only six "dirty" days.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules will be a major change for some beaches. The popular
Surfrider Beach in downtown Malibu, for instance, exceeded bacteria
standards 47 days, on average, during the rainy season.</TE>
<TE>   Cities and the county have 10 years to meet these standards, by
upgrading leaky septic tanks, fortifying sewage lines and diverting
urban-runoff pollutants carried into storm drains.</TE>
<TE>   Some action will have to begin sooner. The standards will be
phased in, requiring a 25% reduction in the number of days exceeding
bacteria standards within six years and a 50% reduction within eight
years.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Los Angeles will be given up to 18 years because of an
approach that combines reducing pollutants and capturing half of the
city's runoff so that it can percolate into the earth to recharge the
groundwater.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules on bacteria, the result of three years of
negotiations by experts, state and local governments and
environmentalists, do not mean the ocean will be free of
human-generated bacteria. It uses a federal standard of acceptable
risk in marine waters: No more than 19 of 1,000 people exposed will
get sick.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not everything we wanted," said Steve Fleischli, director of
Santa Monica BayKeeper. "There are some legal deficiencies."</TE>

<LD>The Santa Clarita City Council voted to attempt to annex 555 acres on
the city's southern border in an effort to control a 5,800-home
development planned there.</LD>
<LD>   The council voted unanimously Tuesday to try to annex the property
in unincorporated Los Angeles County. Developers of the proposed Las
Lomas subdivision want it to be a part of the city of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Clarita officials fear the project will block an important
wildlife corridor, snarl traffic and damage the beauty of the hills
that separate them from the San Fernando Valley.</LD>

<LD>   Judge Thomas Hastings became emotional and abruptly left the bench
before imposing the death sentence reached by a jury in October.
Victims' relatives and jurors who had returned to the courtroom also
wept.</LD>
<TE>   Hastings rejected defense claims of juror misconduct and said
there was overwhelming evidence against Stayner. He said the killings
had taken a devastating emotional toll that justified execution.</TE>
<TE>   Stayner was convicted of murdering Carole Sund, 42, her daughter,
Juli, 15, and their Argentine friend, Silvina Pelosso, 16, during a
trip to Yosemite in February 1999. The jury rejected an insanity
defense.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen anything that's so close to black and white and
evil and good as Stayner and our children," said Francis Carrington,
the father of Carole Sund and grandfather of Juli. "I'm so proud of
the way Carole and Juli lived, and I'm so ashamed of Stayner."</TE>
<TE>   The case automatically will be appealed to the state Supreme
Court.</TE>
<TE>   Stayner's father, Delbert Stayner, said outside court Thursday
that his son had been deprived of a fair trial by a "kangaroo court"
and a judge who ignored defense arguments.</TE>
<TE>   The strongest pieces of evidence against Stayner were his own
words to the FBI when he was picked up for questioning in July 1999,
after the headless body of nature guide Joie Armstrong was found near
her cabin in the park.</TE>
<TE>   In a tape-recorded confession that lasted hours, Stayner discussed
how he had fantasized about killing and saw opportunity Feb. 15,
1999, when the tourists were alone in their room at the Cedar Lodge,
where he worked.</TE>
<TE>   Stayner tricked his way into the room, bound the three with duct
tape and then killed them, strangling the mother and Pelosso and then
molesting Juli before driving her to a reservoir in the Sierra Nevada
foothills and slashing her throat.</TE>
<TE>   It was more than a month before the charred bodies of the elder
Sund and Pelosso were found in the trunk of their torched rental car,
which had been abandoned in a forest. A week later, Juli's
decomposing body was discovered under brush on a hillside.</TE>
<TE>   As the crimes went unsolved, terror swept the Central Valley and
the rugged Sierra Nevada, casting a shadow over Yosemite's serene
image.</TE>
<TE>   Stayner, 41, who is serving life in federal prison without parole
for murdering Armstrong, is under an order to be returned to federal
custody, defense lawyer Marcia Morrissey said.</TE>
<TE>   But a spokesman for the state Department of Corrections said the
harsher sentence would probably force Stayner to be transferred to
state custody.</TE>

<HD>Crime Rampage Draws Term of 129 to Life</HD>
<DH>Glendale man killed a motorist while fleeing police and
committed a series of robberies while awaiting sentence for previous
conviction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Guccione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Glendale man who went on a deadly crime rampage, knowing he was
about to be incarcerated for a previous crime, was sentenced to 129
years to life in prison Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   William Tanielian, 35, was convicted of killing Milo Flores, 34,
of Alhambra and injuring Flores' sister when he crashed his vehicle
into theirs during a high-speed police pursuit in Eagle Rock on May
23, 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Tanielian and two other men were wanted by police for as many as
50 armed robberies at fast-food chicken restaurants in the San
Fernando Valley, the Wilshire district and on the Westside in March,
April and May 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Tanielian was convicted in October of murder, evading police
causing injury, 22 armed robberies and five attempted armed
robberies, as well as assaulting a female nurse while he was being
treated for wounds he suffered in the car crash, said Deputy Dist.
Atty. Tal Kahana.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Robert J. Perry sentenced
Tanielian to 30 years to life for the murder plus 99 years and eight
months in prison on the remaining counts.</TE>
<TE>   The career criminal got such a long sentence because of prior
convictions, including one for brandishing a gun at a driver on the
freeway, according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   Tanielian is currently serving a nine-year term after a conviction
for grand theft for stealing $410 worth of compact discs. He pleaded
no contest to the charge in a Pomona courtroom on Feb. 27, 2001, four
days before the armed robberies began.</TE>
<TE>   As a condition of his plea, Tanielian asked the court for 60 days
to get his personal affairs in order before being sentenced and was
released on $35,000 bail. Commissioner Wade D. Olson ordered him to
return to court on April 24, 2001, for sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't come back or you get in any kind of trouble when I
finally get you back here, you're going to get the [maximum sentence
of] nine years," Olson warned, according to the transcript.</TE>
<TE>   Tanielian did not heed Olson's warning.</TE>
<TE>   Four days after leaving the Pomona courtroom, he and two others
committed their first armed robbery, authorities said. He did not
return to face Olson until captured by police a month later on the
other charges.</TE>
<TE>   Another suspect, Antonio Almandarez, 33, of Reseda, was killed in
a shootout with police in Van Nuys later that same day. The third
suspect, Carlos Cumplido, who is also charged in the robberies, is
believed to have fled to Mexico, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   When police attempted to make arrests, Tanielian led them on a
chase in the Glendale area that ended with the crash that killed
Flores.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Robison, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office,
said that, in hindsight, prosecutors should have objected to the low
bail for Tanielian on the grand theft charge because he had prior
convictions. "It should not have happened this way," she said. "This
was unfortunate."</TE>
<TE>   Tanielian's attorney, Andrew Flier, declined to criticize the
handling of the earlier criminal case. "There was no indication that
Mr. Tanielian was a potential armed robber or would flee police," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   If Tanielian had turned himself in on the other case, "it would
have been in the best interest of everyone: the community, the victim
and Mr. Tanielian," Flier said, noting that his client will now die
in prison.</TE>

<HD>Court Expands Tax Suit</HD>
<DH>Litigation accusing O.C. of property-tax overcharges gets
class-action status.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge on Thursday granted class-action status to a lawsuit accusing
Orange County of overcharging on property taxes, setting the stage
for a legal showdown that could cost local governments billions of
dollars in tax refunds.</LD>
<LD>   The decision comes a year after Judge John M. Watson ruled in
favor of a Seal Beach homeowner, concluding that Orange County
violated Proposition 13 in the way it calculated the man's property
tax bill.</LD>
<LD>   The case now goes to the state 4th District Court of Appeal, whose
decision will have far-reaching implications, because all 58 counties
in California use the same method for determining property-tax
assessments.</LD>
<TE>   Orange County officials say that if the ruling is applied to all
taxpayers, the county would have to refund up to $1 billion. Los
Angeles County officials, who have been closely watching the case,
said they could be liable for $4 billion if the outcome applies to
them.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 13, the landmark 1978 ballot measure, limited annual
property-tax assessment hikes to no more than 2%. Counties, however,
frequently boost tax assessments more than 2% to "recapture" taxes
they could not collect when property values dropped or stayed flat.</TE>
<TE>   Seal Beach homeowner Robert Pool sued Orange County, saying his
tax bill went up by 4% in one year. He bought the home for $330,000
in 1995, and for years its value stayed flat because of the cool real
estate market. Then, in 1998, the county boosted the tax assessment
of his home by 4%, to $343,332.</TE>
<TE>   Watson sided with Pool a year ago. And on Thursday, he ruled that
all Orange County property owners whose assessments rose more than 2%
a year since Proposition 13's passage were potentially harmed.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign of how far-reaching the issue is, Watson also removed
himself as a potential member of the class-action suit after
attorneys for the county noted that he owned rental property in La
Habra that might qualify for a refund.</TE>
<TE>   County officials said their assessment method was agreed upon by
tax officials across the state after Proposition 13 was passed. They
maintain it's legal to reclaim taxes on properties that did not
receive tax increases during depressed years.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 13, they say, set a ceiling on property taxes that
grew at 2% a year since 1978, regardless of how much the increases
are year to year.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting the suit has proven costly for Orange County. Assessor
Webster J. Guillory will ask supervisors Tuesday to increase to
$900,000 the amount to be paid to his attorney, Robert Luskin.
Treasurer John M.W. Moorlach said his attorney, Harvey Liederman, has
charged less than $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   The 4th District Court of Appeal has not been shy about
challenging local governments on taxation issues. In his ruling,
Judge Watson quoted liberally from a 4th District appellate decision
published last month that chastised Orange County for failing to
follow the law in a different property tax case.</TE>
<TE>   That ruling, written by Presiding Justice David Sills, reinstated
a class-action lawsuit filed by a San Juan Capistrano man on behalf
of about 1,500 taxpayers who were denied reductions in 1994 after
challenging their tax bills.</TE>
<TE>   Attending Thursday's court hearing were a handful of taxpayers
such as Alan Lavallee of Buena Park. Lavallee said the county hiked
the assessed value of his home nearly 52% between 1999 and 2002.</TE>

<HD>Father of Man Slain in Street Says 'There's War Going On'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A father grieved and friends expressed anger Thursday on a street in
the Rosewood neighborhood where the night before two young men were
fatally shot and two women wounded by three men who had suddenly
appeared and begun shooting.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a war going on," said Randy S. Laney of Gardena, whose
son was killed Wednesday night. "It has been going on for a long
time, and it happens over and over and over."</LD>
<LD>   Laney said he had been called to East 136th Street, where he found
his son, Randy K. Laney, 25, of Los Angeles, lying in the street and
then overheard on a deputy's radio that his son was dead.</LD>
<TE>   The young man had just visited his grandmother's house two blocks
away and then walked over to see friends on 136th Street.</TE>
<TE>   The other fatality, identified by a brother as Joaquin Hillman,
22, apparently was one of those friends.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators Thursday had not found the three men who allegedly
opened fire on the street at 7:30 p.m., nor had they determined
whether the shootings were gang-related.</TE>
<TE>   Tynisa Cox, a neighbor, said each of the assailants had been
carrying a handgun.</TE>
<TE>   "They walked up with their guns showing and said, 'Don't be
scared,' and then they just started shooting," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "They killed innocent bystanders," said a youth who identified
himself as Nathan Long. "Let everyone know that. Joaquin Hillman had
just walked out of the house after eating."</TE>

<HD>No Charges in Killing of Tyisha Miller</HD>
<DH>The Justice Department says it finds insufficient evidence
to prosecute four white Riverside police officers who shot the black
woman in car.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Rosenzweig</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Justice Department's civil rights division said Thursday it had
found insufficient evidence to prosecute four white Riverside police
officers involved in the 1998 shooting death of a 19-year-old black
woman who passed out in her car with a gun in her lap.</LD>
<LD>   "Tyisha Miller's death was a terrible tragedy," said Assistant
U.S. Atty. Gen. Gerald Boyd. "Our decision to close this
investigation does not signal approval of the conduct of these
officers, or indeed any official opinion concerning their conduct,
but the bottom line is that our investigation, which was conducted
conscientiously, has not revealed enough evidence to support federal
criminal prosecution."</LD>
<LD>   Boyd said any negligence, poor judgment or mistake by the officers
was not enough to warrant criminal charges</LD>
<TE>   Debra W. Yang, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, met with Miller's
family to convey the Justice Department's findings, a spokesman said.
Some relatives and family supporters reacted with anger and
disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's death created an uproar among many African Americans in
Riverside, exposing a deep racial divide. It also led to intervention
by state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, who ordered the Police Department
to adopt a sweeping reform plan designed to root out any racism.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer's office also declined to prosecute on grounds of
insufficient evidence. However, the four officers were fired. Two are
fighting to be reinstated.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd said federal investigators reviewed the results of the local
investigation and then began their own probe, interviewing witnesses
to the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Miller was killed Dec. 28, 1998, when the four officers were
summoned to a service station where she had locked herself in her
disabled car, and then passed out while a friend had gone for help.</TE>
<TE>   The officers said they tried unsuccessfully to rouse her. One then
broke a side window, according to the police account, causing Miller
to sit bolt upright. Fearing for their lives, they said, they opened
fire. Miller did not fire her gun. Officers fired 24 times, striking
her with 12 bullets.</TE>
<TE>   "Our investigation did not reveal evidence disproving the
officers' claim that they subsequently shot out of fear for their
safety," Boyd said. "All eyewitnesses confirm that Ms. Miller had a
gun in her lap and the forensic evidence corroborates the claim that
she sat up -- a perceived movement toward the gun -- when one of the
officers shattered the window of the locked car to gain entrance and
render aid to Ms. Miller."</TE>
<TE>   He said the federal investigation revealed that the first shots
were fired while the officer who had shattered the window was leaning
inside the car trying to reach for the gun in Miller's lap.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the officers admit firing even while their colleague
was leaning into the car is strong evidence that they acted out of
fear rather than with any malicious intent, Boyd said.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department is still conducting a civil investigation
into the policies and practices of the Riverside Police Department,
Boyd said, including an analysis of its dealings with minorities.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the decision not to prosecute, U.S. Atty. Yang said her
office remains committed to prosecuting civil rights violations
whenever the evidence supports criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor of Riverside, Ronald Loveridge, said Thursday night that
"this is another chapter, among the last to be closed. The city has
moved forward. We've increased the professionalism and community
policing. There is widespread community support for the Riverside
Police Department."</TE>
<TE>   He also said the city respects "the legal skills and values and
research that led to the Department of Justice's decision."</TE>
<TE>   But the decision was criticized by some in the community who had
been involved with the family or the case. It also rekindled a bitter
disagreement within the community over the Miller family's decision
to settle a wrongful-death lawsuit with the city for $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Bernell Butler, a preacher and Miller's cousin, said he
disagreed with the decision to settle but backed the rest of the
family at the time. Now, he said, he believes the settlement is
coming back to haunt Miller's relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "When they settled, it gave the federal government an out to sweep
this thing under the carpet. It took away the drive and motivation
for justice," Butler said. "These guys murdered her with malice,
prejudice and bigotry. She was murdered. And she was a good girl."</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn B. Murray, a member of the Tyisha Miller Steering
Committee and a professor of psychology and ethnic studies at UC
Riverside, said she was disappointed with the decision, but not
shocked.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't prosecute white, male police officers. They just don't
-- even when the evidence is overwhelming," Murray said. "That's the
American way. People say we live in a democracy. It's a facade. It's
a democracy for a few."</TE>
<TE>   Murray agreed with those who found the government's explanations
lame at best.</TE>
<TE>   "They had enough evidence to try those officers, if not on the
count of murder, then on manslaughter or violating her civil rights,"
Murray said. "The officers that were involved all told different
stories about what happened. But they all agreed on one thing: The
first bullet was fired from outside the car."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Halstead of Highland, a friend of Miller's family and an
original member of the Steering Committee, said civil rights
activists worked for weeks after the shooting to persuade angry
youths not to take to the streets with violence.</TE>
<TE>   "We kept all that from happening," Halstead said. "And this is how
you repay us. This is what I told [federal prosecutors]: 'You
undermined our credibility. You treated us like a bunch of thugs.'
They are sending a message that is the wrong message. They are
sending a message to the citizens of the United States that cops are
going to get away with this."</TE>

<HD>O. Villas Boas, 88; Helped Brazil Indians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orlando Villas Boas, a Brazilian explorer who gained an international
reputation along with his brothers for protecting the rights of
Brazilian Indians, died Thursday at a Sao Paulo hospital. He was 88.</LD>
<LD>   Villas Boas had been hospitalized since Nov. 14 with an acute
intestinal infection.</LD>
<LD>   He was the last of four brothers who spent their lives defending
Brazil's natives against the harmful incursions of Westerners.</LD>
<TE>   He and brothers Leo- nardo, Claudio and Alvaro were members of the
Roncador-Xingu expedition, which was created by the government in
1943 to study unexplored regions of Brazil's interior and to chart
areas for towns, roads, airfields and other advances.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, after meeting the Indians of the Upper Xingu River Basin,
the Villas Boas brothers vowed to do all they could to preserve a way
of life that had not changed in centuries.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando Villas Boas was born in 1914 on his father's coffee
plantation near Botucatu, 150 miles northwest of Sao Paulo.</TE>
<TE>   He was 29 when he joined the Roncador-Xingu expedition, which
lasted from 1943 to 1960. During that time, the Villas Boas brothers
helped establish Western civilization's first contact with several
Indian tribes: the Xavantes (1948), the Jurunas (1949), the Kayabis
(1951), the Txucarramaes (1953) and the Suyas (1959).</TE>
<TE>   After seeing the harm that roads, airstrips and contact with the
white man caused the Indians, the brothers became the tribes' most
outspoken advocates.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando and Claudio eventually moved in with Indians and stayed in
the jungle for 32 years. In 1961, they persuaded the government to
create its first, and probably most successful, reservation: the
Xingu National Park. Today, more than 3,000 Indians live there, in
relative isolation from white culture.</TE>
<TE>   During those years, Villas Boas worked to keep other Brazilians
and tourists out of the reserve and to refrain from meddling in
village affairs. He also sought to keep traditional healers'
medicinal knowledge out of the hands of "biotech pirates" who sell
rare flora and fauna to pharmaceutical companies in rich nations.</TE>
<TE>   When they founded the reservation more than 40 years ago, "the old
idea that the Indian was a beast was common currency," Villas Boas
told the Associated Press last year. "But what we showed to Brazilian
society was that we had made contact with communities that were at
peace, full of joy.</TE>
<TE>   "I lived with them for 40 years, and I never saw a mother twist
her daughter's ear or a father give his son a slap. It was, and is, a
fantastic thing, a revolutionary concept."</TE>
<TE>   The Villas Boas brothers had critics among supporters of Indian
self-determination, who saw them as overly protective and
paternalistic.</TE>
<TE>   But their work in defense of the country's indigenous population
earned them many honors, including the Founders' Gold Medal of the
Royal Geographical Society.</TE>
<TE>   Claudio and Orlando, who co-wrote at least 12 books, were
nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   In 1967, Orlando founded Brazil's Indian Affairs Bureau. In later
years, he held a largely honorary position there, from which he was
unceremoniously fired by fax in January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   His dismissal caused a national outcry. A week later, President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso apologized for the firing.</TE>
<TE>   Villas Boas is survived by his wife, Marina, a nurse he met in
1963 at the Xingu Park, where she treated diseases; and their two
sons, Orlando Villas Boas Filho, 33, and Noel, 27.</TE>

<HD>Predawn Procession Begins Day of Honoring Virgin of
Guadalupe</HD>
<DH>The faithful bear the image of Mexico's patron saint from
old L.A. cathedral to new, where a Mass kicks off a variety of
events.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Before sunrise Thursday, a snaking mass of guadalupanos braved the
morning chill and paraded through downtown's streets behind an image
of the Virgin of Guadalupe, a traditional procession that marks the
feast day of the patron saint of Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   They were led by a large troupe of Aztec dancers who punctuated
the predawn calm with pounding drums, showing how the Dec. 12 holiday
is as much a pageant of Mexican culture as it is a religious
celebration.</LD>
<LD>   "It's faith for the Virgin that moves us to come here. We wait on
her love and miracles," said Elivia Perez, 42, as she watched the
bundled-up pilgrims go by. "It's part of our culture."</LD>
<TE>   Since Sunday, Guadalupe-related services and performances have
been held all over Los Angeles. Believers have come out in larger
numbers this year because the image in the procession, held
customarily before dawn, is an "official replica" of the original
from the Virgin's basilica in Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's procession started at the old St. Vibiana's Cathedral
on Main and 2nd streets, and took nearly an hour to cover the
half-mile to the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels on Temple
Street. There, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony welcomed the faithful.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles-area Spanish television networks covered the
procession and the Mass that Mahony celebrated at 5:30 a.m.,
streaming footage from helicopters and featuring on-location anchors.</TE>
<TE>   The procession and Mass kicked off a full day of events at the
cathedral and the nearby La Placita Church near Olvera Street that
included several Masses, as well as dance and musical performances.</TE>
<TE>   The Virgin of Guadalupe is said to have appeared before Juan Diego
on Dec. 12, 1531, atop a hill outside Mexico City. The image of the
Virgin emblazoned on his cloak, deemed a miracle, helped tremendously
to advance the goals of the Spanish church as it tried to convert the
recently conquered native peoples of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Virgin has been regarded as the "Empress of the
Americas" and has even become a pop culture icon for Latino youth and
artists. She is credited for thousands of miracles, and is widely
considered a protector of the poor and meek.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always had great devotion for the Virgin of Guadalupe. It
was like a manda [mandate] for me to be here, even though I'm a guero
colorado [a red-faced white man]," chuckled Father Pat Brennan. "The
Virgin belongs to all of us. She is the Empress of the Americas."</TE>
<TE>   The special image has been taken to several parishes across the
Archdiocese of Los Angeles for more than a week. It will reside for
some time at the cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   By midmorning, hundreds of people had converged on La Placita,
where a growing profusion of flowers was piled high against a
much-loved mural of the Virgin. Hundreds of lighted candles adorned
the makeshift altar.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, children in colorful traditional dress had their pictures
taken before mini-images of the Virgin as excited parents urged them
to smile.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, she is the one who gives us miracles. We all came here as
immigrants, suffering, and that's a miracle," said 70-year-old Lillia
Pacheco.</TE>

<HD>Defense Loses Bid for Police Records</HD>
<DH>Judge says files on the officer, who wounded a foster girl
later accused of assault, show no history of excessive force or
coercion.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Personnel records of a Ventura police officer who shot a 14-year-old
foster child show no evidence of past encounters involving excessive
force, dishonesty or coercion, a judge concluded Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for the girl lost their bid to introduce the documents
during a pretrial hearing before Juvenile Court Judge Brian Back. The
girl is charged with assaulting an officer with a deadly weapon -- a
kitchen knife she had used to threaten suicide in her foster home in
May.</LD>
<LD>   The girl was shot three times by Officer Kristin Rupp, who was
cleared of any wrongdoing in a departmental review.</LD>
<TE>   Back spent an hour poring over personnel records of Rupp and two
other officers who came to the girl's Ventura foster home on May 5.</TE>
<TE>   None of the records were "even remotely related" to the issues of
the case, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Police contend that the distraught girl was shot after refusing to
drop the knife and taking what appeared to be a threatening step
toward Rupp.</TE>
<TE>   But attorneys for the girl, who is being tried in Juvenile Court,
have maintained that the 23-year-old Rupp made a mistake in using
deadly force and that other officers on the scene have aided in a
cover-up.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that the officers as a group didn't follow procedure,"
attorney Paul Loh said. "When something goes wrong, there's a motive
to change or modify what happened."</TE>
<TE>   The girl was raised by her grandmother in China and immigrated two
years ago to join her father, who ran a Newbury Park restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   She was placed in foster care after she fought with him over a
boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Her trial is to begin Monday.</TE>

<HD>Deal Includes $107 Million to Retire Farmland</HD>
<DH>U.S. officials propose settling a growers' suit by paying
them to stop farming poisoned land. Critics call it a giveaway of
taxpayer money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Arax and Steve Hymon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>FRESNO</DL>
<LD>In a proposed settlement of a 10-year-old lawsuit, the Department of
the Interior has agreed to pay $107 million to retire farmland laden
with salts and toxic minerals, the consequence of growers irrigating
land in an ancient seabed without proper drainage.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, the deal came under criticism from environmentalists
who called it a giveaway of taxpayer money that will undermine
federal efforts to restore California fisheries.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the money could come from a federal fund to boost San
Francisco Bay Delta fisheries harmed by water diversions for San
Joaquin Valley farming, federal officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Environmentalists said they thought the long-awaited deal would
allow the federal government to take over ownership of the problem
land in the Westlands Water District.</TE>
<TE>   But the 18-page settlement filed in U.S. District Court reveals
that the government would not only forgo ownership of the salty land,
it also would allow Westlands to keep the federally subsidized water
allocated to the farms.</TE>
<TE>   After Westlands pays the growers $28 million -- or $850 an acre --
the water district will take over ownership of the 32,500 acres from
the 19 farming families that sued. The water district and the growers
can still dry-farm the land -- meaning they can use only rainwater.
They also would retain the right to develop the land into houses and
distribution centers, a potential windfall of tens of millions of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "These are growers who cooked their own goose by irrigating land
that should have never been farmed for decades and decades," said
Lloyd Carter, a professor of water law at San Joaquin College of Law
and president of Save Our Streams, a local environmental group. "Now
they want the taxpayers to rescue them, and the U.S. Department of
Interior is proposing to do just that."</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Westlands and officials with the Interior Department
defend the deal, saying the federal government failed on its promise
to build a drainage system for the farmers. If the matter had made
its way to trial, they say, the government could have been on the
hook for hundreds of millions of dollars more.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists point out that Congress allocated money for a
drainage system in the 1960s. But the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation,
under pressure from growers, used it instead to improve a water
delivery system that brought into production more than 150,000 acres
of hillside land heavy in salts. It was that increase that worsened
the drainage problem, causing salt-laden water to intrude on better
land in the district's lower-lying areas.</TE>
<TE>   The valley's west side was desert scrub in the early 1900s when a
group of pioneer farmers began growing wheat and barley by pumping
water from beneath the hard clay. Over the decades the land sank
because of over-pumping, and in the early 1960s the Bureau of
Reclamation extended the massive Central Valley Project irrigation
system to Westlands.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, government scientists and environmentalists warned
that the vast cotton, grain and vegetable farms on Fresno County's
west side would eventually succumb to salts. Selenium, a naturally
occurring mineral, lies dormant in the soil until irrigation water
brings it to the surface.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, the government connected pipes that shunted drainage
water from the farms to Kesterson Reservoir near Los Banos. The plan
was to continue the drainage all the way to the Bay Delta, but the
ponds at Kesterson were shut down in 1986 after being linked to
massive fish kills and mutations in migratory birds.</TE>
<TE>   For the next decade, the state and federal government spent almost
$100 million on studies to resolve the drainage problem but no
permanent plan was put in place. Then came the lawsuit from 19
growers and the settlement announced Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the taxpayers and the Department of the Interior ... did
a risk assessment and concluded that given the potential liability of
the U.S. to these individual landowners, it was better to settle than
to risk going to trial," said Tom Birmingham, general manager for
Westlands.</TE>
<TE>   Birmingham said the district has suffered from two big problems:
poor drainage and a chronic shortage of water that has idled farmland
and hurt the economies of small towns. Getting land out of production
is expected to make for a smaller but healthier farm district.</TE>

<HD>Bali Was Named a Target in February, Police Say</HD>
<DH>Two detained leaders of a terrorist network allegedly
describe details of meetings in Thailand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>Two leaders of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist network have confessed
that the group's top council proposed Bali as a bombing target during
a February meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, according to a senior police
officer investigating the attack.</LD>
<LD>   Six leaders of the Southeast Asian network were present at the
meeting, including Abu Bakar Bashir, the suspected leader of Jemaah
Islamiah, the senior officer said Wednesday. Bashir has since been
arrested in Indonesia for his alleged role in other terrorist
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The statements attributed to the two suspects are the first
evidence directly linking Bashir to the Oct. 12 nightclub bombing,
which killed at least 191 people, many of them young foreign
tourists. Bashir, a radical 64-year-old cleric once imprisoned in
Indonesia for sedition, denies any part in terrorism and contends
that Jemaah Islamiah does not exist.</LD>
<TE>   The arrest of the two Jemaah Islamiah leaders and their reported
confessions are a significant breakthrough for the Bali
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest break came last week when Indonesian police tracked
down religious teacher Ali Gufron, better known as Mukhlas, at a
house in Central Java. When police cornered him, he tried to grab a
pistol from one of the officers, but quickly was subdued, the police
official said. Police found that he also was carrying his own FN
handgun. Mukhlas, 42, has since admitted organizing and overseeing
the Bali attack, the police official said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 27, two weeks before the Bali bombing, Malaysian police
seized Wan Min Wan Mat, 42, a former university lecturer who had been
on the run for months. Wanted for his alleged role in terrorist
activities in Malaysia, he was arrested when he slipped back into the
country to visit his wife and four children.</TE>
<TE>   Both Mukhlas and Wan Min have begun talking to authorities, and
their accounts match, said the senior police officer, who asked not
to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   The initial planning for the Bali attack came just weeks after
Jemaah Islamiah suffered its first major setback.</TE>
<TE>   The group's operations were severely disrupted last December when
Singapore authorities learned of the terrorists' plan for suicide
attacks on the U.S. embassy and six other high-profile targets in
that country with massive truck bombs. Dozens were arrested in
Singapore and Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   The following month, Jemaah Islamiah leaders met in southern
Thailand. Concluding that security measures made it too difficult to
attack military installations or embassies, they agreed that they
would bomb a "soft target," such as a tourist site, the police
investigator said.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the Jemaah Islamiah leadership convened another
meeting in Thailand, this time in the capital, Bangkok. Six top
leaders attended and nominated Bali as the place to attack next.
Bashir, Mukhlas and Wan Min were all at the meeting, the investigator
said.</TE>
<TE>   Also attending was the elusive Riduan Isamuddin, 36, better known
as Hambali, the operations leader of Jemaah Islamiah and a suspected
Al Qaeda operative with a long history of terrorist attacks in
Southeast Asia. He is wanted in at least four countries: Indonesia,
Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth leader who took part in the meeting was a Malaysian
named Noor Din Mohammed Top, 33, who had attended the university
where Wan Min taught. Both Wan Min and Top are also believed to be
leaders of Kumpulan Militan Malaysia, a terrorist group affiliated
with Jemaah Islamiah.</TE>
<TE>   The sixth Jemaah Islamiah leader who attended the meeting has not
been identified.</TE>
<TE>   Mukhlas was given operational authority for the Bali attack. Under
instructions from Hambali, Wan Min gave Mukhlas $35,500 to finance
the bombing, according to the police official. Wan Min told police
that he did not know the money was intended for the Bali bombing
until later.</TE>
<TE>   Detailed planning for the Bali bombing took place in August and
September. Mukhlas met in Central Java with at least two of the bomb
plotters, Imam Samudra, who coordinated the attack, and Amrozi,
Mukhlas' brother, who bought the car and chemicals used for the
bombing, the investigator said. Amrozi and Imam Samudra also have
been arrested.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Bashir concluded that it was the wrong time to carry
out violent acts because it could provoke a police crackdown,
according to a report issued this week by the International Crisis
Group, a Brussels-based research organization.</TE>
<TE>   The younger members of the Jemaah Islamiah council overruled
Bashir, however, and the attack went forward, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence officials say that Hambali appointed Mukhlas to take
over his role as Jemaah Islamiah operations leader earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   They say Hambali was unable to organize any attacks because he had
been forced into hiding by a police manhunt mounted after the
discovery of the Singapore plot.</TE>

<HD>Mideast Violence Moves to the Home Front</HD>
<DH>For Israelis and Palestinians alike, conflict spills over
into other circles of life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilkinson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>JERUSALEM -- In a small sanctuary near the ancient Phoenician city of
Caesarea, Israeli therapists are treating discharged soldiers for an
affliction some call "intifada syndrome": The young men are violent
and confused. In Palestinian cities, social workers face a wave of
women who were beaten or abused at home and a rash of intra-clan
murders.</LD>
<LD>   Everywhere, children are learning about hate. Life seems cheap.
The basic fabric of the family, in two societies where family ties
are strong, is being shredded by the trauma of war.</LD>
<LD>   With Israelis and Palestinians locked in their deadliest fighting
in decades, urban violence by gunmen and tanks is spilling over into
other circles of life, creating fissures that will have an effect
long after peace is declared.</LD>
<TE>   Extremism and a tolerance of brutality have spread. Despair over
the future -- over whether there even is a future -- dominates the
thinking of youth as well as their parents.</TE>
<TE>   Psychologists, social workers, scholars and other experts report
an alarming rate of domestic violence.</TE>
<TE>   Economic hardships brought on by war exacerbate the tension.
Palestinian men trapped at home by Israeli-imposed closures and
curfews feel diminished self-worth and often take it out on the
family, experts say. They've been humiliated at checkpoints in front
of their children; they are unable to provide for or even protect
their families. They watch soldiers destroy homes and shoot or arrest
their neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Unemployed Israeli men have seen their traditional role as
breadwinner threatened. Nearly one in five Israelis now lives below
the poverty line; three in five Palestinians are similarly
impoverished.</TE>
<TE>   Both societies report a growing acceptance of violence.
Palestinian children revere suicide bombers; Israeli children chant
"Death to the Arabs!" on school playgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   "The short-term impact [of the war] may sometimes look positive:
unity, cohesion, patriotism. But the real damage is in the long
term," said Zvi Eisikovits, dean of the college of social welfare and
health at Israel's University of Haifa.</TE>
<TE>   "Attitudes toward violence are changing to the point where
violence is an acceptable means to solve problems. There is an
overall desensitization to human life and a desensitization to
suffering as a way to survive suffering."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, neither side recognizes the suffering of the other
because its own suffering is so great. Each side dehumanizes the
other as a way to make abuse acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   Eisikovits co-wrote the most comprehensive study to date on
violence against women in Israel. He found that 11% of women said
their spouses assaulted them. What he found most alarming, he said,
was the high percentage of women -- one in four -- who justified the
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Right and wrong get blurred when a nation is at war, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very hard to tell an 18-year-old that it's OK to brutalize
somebody in [the Palestinian city of] Jenin, but it's not OK to go
home and brutalize your girlfriend."</TE>
<TE>   At a crowded shelter in the Israeli city of Herzliya, with an
address that is kept secret to protect the residents, Ruth Rasnic
must turn away three of every five women who seek help. Some arrive
with broken limbs, cracked teeth and bruised faces. But there isn't
room for all of them. There are only 13 shelters in all of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "We need 50," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The pervasiveness of the military in Israeli society -- almost
everyone serves a stint in the army -- makes weapons readily
available. Restrictions on gun possession do not take into account a
man's record of battering, advocates say, and reservists are
routinely allowed to take home army-issue weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The war and militarization of society are only partly to blame for
the increased violence. Immigrants from more conservative countries,
such as Ethiopia, where women have no public role, are often
unsettled by culture shock; alcoholism may be a factor among
immigrants from areas such as the former Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   "From talking to hundreds of women, I get the feeling that a man
who is violent will be violent for any reason," said Rasnic, a
pioneer in the fight against domestic abuse in Israel. "But it will
accelerate at times of stress: bereavement, loss of job, war -- any
serious tension triggers more violence."</TE>
<TE>   More women in Israel were killed by male relatives in 1991, the
year of the Persian Gulf War, than in any other year, Rasnic said.
The average is 20 per year; that doubled in 1991, went back down
until last year, and then jumped by about 50%. (The figures include
all Israeli women, including Arab Israelis, among whom Rasnic
believes such killings are greatly underreported.)</TE>
<TE>   About 7,000 women have filed criminal complaints this year
alleging violent abuse by their spouses, according to Gideon Ezra,
deputy minister for internal security.</TE>
<TE>   Alona, a 32-year-old store clerk, arrived at Rasnic's shelter a
couple of months ago with her 3-year-old son. Her husband started
slapping her shortly after the boy's birth, but it got worse this
year after he lost his job with a high-tech company, she said. Alona
doesn't want to blame the conflict, though, because that would be
excusing his behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "It affects me too, but I get up in the morning and do what I have
to do," she said of the intifada. "If I can deal with it, why can't
he?"</TE>
<TE>   Many women do not reach shelters.</TE>
<TE>   Over the summer, Herzlyia Yair obtained a restraining order
against her husband, Yeheskal, whom she was trying to divorce.
Despite the court order, he allegedly strangled her and beat her to
death with a hammer.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, Rachel Nizri allegedly was set on fire by her
husband. She languished for weeks before dying.</TE>
<TE>   Israel is not as violent as many Western countries, including the
United States. But recent headlines have been sensational: two
13-year-olds arrested for raping and beating an 11-year-old; a rash
of attacks by teenage girl gangs on classmates that left several
young girls injured and traumatized.</TE>
<TE>   Road rage is on the rise; young Jewish settlers fight young Jewish
soldiers trying to evict them from illegal outposts in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "Nowhere is the slide to brutality in this country more
appallingly evident than in the rising tide of abuse against women,"
columnist Thomas O'Dwyer wrote in the influential daily newspaper
Haaretz. It testifies, he said, to "the legacy of occupation,
conflict and a pervading culture of vengeance and intolerance that
has wiped any mention of coexistence off the national agenda."</TE>
<TE>   It is more difficult to quantify violence against women in the
Palestinian West Bank and Gaza Strip. Violence and incest are taboo
topics but are tolerated in much of Arab culture.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian society's economic, social and political gains of the
last decade have been lost to renewed Israeli occupation and
destruction of basic infrastructure. Traditional roles are being
strained, and religious fundamentalism is growing.</TE>
<TE>   The number of Palestinian women killed by relatives soared from
eight in 1998 to about 30 this year, according to Suad Abu Dayyeh,
head of the social work division of the Palestinian Women's Center
for Legal Aid and Counseling in East Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   "Honor killings," in which a male kills a female relative who is
accused -- often erroneously -- of sullying the family's reputation,
have always been a problem in the Arab world, including the
Palestinian territories. But the rate in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
now rivals that of Jordan, which is less progressive, Abu Dayyeh
said, reflecting the lawlessness that has washed over the Palestinian
territories.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything we built has failed, so no one trusts the Palestinian
Authority anymore," she said. "The lack of authority makes people do
whatever they want."</TE>
<TE>   Unemployment, poverty and stifling restrictions on their movements
make men feel impotent. They might also lose their home to Israeli
demolition or a child to Israeli gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   Family dynamics are changing, experts say. The father is no longer
seen as the protector; sons are less respectful of their mothers and
sisters. Children go to extremes; they are likely to either be
apathetic or want to become "martyrs," dying for the Palestinian
cause.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of men have been arrested, hundreds killed. Travel to
home villages is often nearly impossible, cutting Palestinians off
from their extended families and their traditional support network.</TE>
<TE>   Women may be pushed into decision-making roles when their men are
gone. But if the man returns, or if the man is present but unable to
provide for his family, the tensions and frictions can be
devastating.</TE>
<TE>   Of women who seek help from the center in East Jerusalem, the
percentage who had run away from home -- the epitome of desperation
for a Palestinian woman -- nearly quadrupled between 1999 and this
year. Incest cases tripled in the same period.</TE>
<TE>   "We already have a patriarchal, gender-insensitive society that
segregates the sexes, and then you have a political situation that
makes women more vulnerable," Abu Dayyeh said. "How can you imagine
what the future will be? We've gone back 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   There is a single shelter for Palestinian women, in the West Bank
city of Nablus; Abu Dayyeh, whose job is to counsel women there, has
been able to reach Nablus from Jerusalem only twice since the
fighting and Israeli roadblocks began. Women who need protection are
often placed in jails or convents.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to put up with her father's beatings, 24-year-old Menel ran
away to relatives. They returned her. She ran away again to more
distant relatives. They also took her home. The next time she ran
away, she was put in jail. But when Israeli forces bombed the jail as
part of an assault on the Palestinian Authority, she was turned over
again to relatives. In September, her 16-year-old brother stabbed her
to death.</TE>
<TE>   The breakdown of legal structures reinforces tribal tradition to
the detriment of women. So does religious fundamentalism. According
to a recent poll sponsored by the Society for the Advancement of the
Palestinian Working Woman, 57% of Palestinians believe a husband has
the right to beat his wife if her behavior impinges on his "manhood."</TE>
<TE>   Other surveys have shown a growing desire, especially among young
Palestinians, for an Islamic state, with little regard for the
political participation of women.</TE>
<TE>   These trends, reinforced by an often bellicose media, lack of
education and extremist religious figures, frighten people like Randa
Siniora, director of the Al Haq human rights organization based in
East Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   "We are creating children who are becoming more violent, more
extremist," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Siniora counts herself among an earlier generation who fought for
national liberation through more peaceful means such as university
demonstrations and marches, with an emphasis on human rights and
pluralism. The apparent failure of those efforts and the persistent
Israeli occupation have alienated the new generation, radicalizing
the struggle, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "This has an influence on Israeli society too," Siniora said,
"because for the first time they see the only way to resolve the
conflict ... is to show Israel how impossible we can make their
lives."</TE>
<TE>   On Israel's northern Mediterranean coast, on green hills
overlooking a vast stretch of blue sea near the city of Caesarea,
social worker Omri Frish treats Israeli soldiers who have been
rattled by their war experience. Most have turned to drugs; some have
attempted suicide.</TE>
<TE>   When Frish opened the Kfar Izun center two years ago, most
patients were veterans of Israel's long war in Lebanon; today, more
and more arrive with what the staff is beginning to refer to as
intifada syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   One former soldier had jumped out of his car and pummeled a
motorist who cut him off. Another beat up his girlfriend nightly.
Others experience flashbacks.</TE>
<TE>   With a small budget from the national drug agency and a handful of
donations, the center has cared for 120 people in the last year and a
half and fielded hundreds of phone consultations. Patients live at
the facility, talk to therapists, act out their fears in group
sessions seated outdoors under the orange sun. They partake in yoga,
reflexology, acupuncture and kung fu.</TE>
<TE>   Frish, 49, was a lieutenant colonel in an army combat unit and
continues to perform reserve duty.</TE>
<TE>   He recalled driving home from duty with a younger officer recently
and stopping at a gas station. The younger officer was very
aggressive with the station attendant until Frish called him on it.</TE>
<TE>   "He caught himself and said, 'Whoa, I didn't make the switch,' "
Frish said. "This isn't Lebanon, where you have a five-hour drive
home. These are the territories. You drive out, and 10 minutes later
you're in [the Israeli city of] Netanya, with the uniform, the gun
and the attitude. You haven't had time to make the mental switch
yet."</TE>
<TE>   Israelis and Palestinians agree that the urgency of the daily
military confrontation relegates domestic violence to the back
burner.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians say that with all catalysts for change in their
society squelched, they are obliged to pay homage to the national
struggle over the battle for individual rights. Israelis voice
similar complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Yael Dayan, daughter of legendary military commander Moshe Dayan
and a legislator who heads the Israeli parliament's committee on the
status of women, said the conflict is often used as an excuse.</TE>
<TE>   "When I go to the budget committee for shelters or more social
workers, they tell me, 'Listen, we are at war, forget about it, we
have other priorities,' " she said. "Security puts domestic violence
in an inferior position."</TE>
<TE>   To the detriment of both societies.</TE>

<HD>Israel to Leave Bethlehem for Christmas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>Israel's president promised the pope Thursday that the army will move
outside Bethlehem during Christmas if there are no warnings of
terrorist attacks, the Israeli Embassy said.</LD>
<LD>   Vatican officials, in talks with President Moshe Katsav, had urged
Israel to allow "free access" during the holiday season in Bethlehem,
where Israeli troops are patrolling Manger Square after occupying the
town.</LD>
<LD>   Katsav, making the first visit by an Israeli head of state to the
Vatican, met with Pope John Paul II and the Vatican's secretary of
state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano. The Vatican said it restated its
support for both Israel and a Palestinian state and the need for a
rapid conclusion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</LD>
<TE>   The military occupation of Bethlehem, the West Bank town revered
by Christians as the site of Jesus' birth, is Israel's third in

<LD>Millions of faithful flocked to Mexico City to honor their beloved
Virgin of Guadalupe, only a few months after Pope John Paul II
canonized the poor Indian man who is said to have seen her.Hundreds
of thousands celebrated the holiday with a series of Masses as Aztec
dancers skipped around traditional incense fires and pilgrims made
their way to the city's basilica.</LD>
<LD>   According to tradition, a dark-skinned virgin appeared to Juan
Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin in December 1531. Millions of pilgrims in the
capital commemorate the event each year.</LD>

<LD>President Vladimir V. Putin signed a decree calling for a referendum
on a constitution and elections in Chechnya, part of his effort to
promote stability and bolster Russian control over the war-torn
region.</LD>
<LD>   The decree gives Chechnya's Moscow-backed administration one month
to organize a plebiscite in which voters would be asked to approve a
draft constitution and bills on electing the republic's president and
parliament.</LD>
<LD>   Critics argue that a referendum is meaningless without an end to
the fighting and that the results are likely to be falsified.</LD>

branded outdated and dangerous.</LD>
<LD>   The special panel on the nonmedical use of drugs said in a report
that marijuana should be decriminalized but not legalized. This means
people possessing and cultivating less than 1.1 ounces would only be
fined if caught.</LD>

<HD>Carter Is Willing to Mediate Mideast Peace Talks if Asked</HD>
<DH>The Nobel Peace Prize winner says Bush has forsaken 'a
balancing role' by favoring Israel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>UPPSALA, Sweden</DL>
<LD>Former President Carter said Thursday that he was willing to mediate
peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians, but only if they and
the U.S. government requested it.</LD>
<LD>   "We would go immediately and with great alacrity," this year's
Nobel peace laureate said in a speech to students at Sweden's Uppsala
University.</LD>
<LD>   However, Carter gave no indication that he had been asked to
mediate.</LD>
<TE>   Carter helped broker the 1978 Camp David accords that led to peace
between Israel and Egypt. The agreement resulted in the Nobel Peace
Prize for Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat.</TE>
<TE>   The former president won the prize this year for that effort as
well as his other peacemaking work since leaving office in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Carter said tension between Israelis and Palestinians hasn't been
stemmed and asserted that President Bush was not impartial about the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   "Until President Bush, every president, Democratic or Republican,
has in my opinion played a balancing role as a trusted mediator," he
said. "Now, though, it seems obvious that the present administration
in Washington is completely compatible with the Israeli government
and they have completely ignored ... the Palestinian Authority."</TE>
<TE>   In Jerusalem, Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Ron Prosor said
Bush should be the one to decide whether Carter should mediate for
the United States. He would not comment on Carter's accusation that
Bush is pro-Israel.</TE>

<HD>Rumsfeld Visits Base in Qatar</HD>
<DH>Defense secretary talks to U.S. troops and the press at a
top-secret command center that is being tested about 700 miles south
of Baghdad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Fineman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CAMP AS SAYLIYAH, Qatar</DL>
<LD>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was 30 minutes into a 37-minute
"town hall meeting" at this top-secret facility that cracked its
doors open Thursday, when a 26-year-old Army captain asked the
question on everyone's mind.</LD>
<LD>   Accompanied by Central Command chief Gen. Tommy Franks on a visit
to this forward command base that would run any war with Iraq,
Rumsfeld stood before hundreds of officers and soldiers in a massive
bomb-resistant warehouse where he discussed military pay, medical
insurance, smallpox vaccines and even the price of oil.</LD>
<LD>   Then, Capt. Amy Souza of the Logistics Task Force 559 out of
Savannah, Ga., uttered the "I" word.</LD>
<TE>   "What are your assessments of Iraq's cooperation in the weapons
inspections?" she asked Rumsfeld and Franks.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld's answer was boilerplate wait-and-see. But Capt. Souza's
need to know was not.</TE>
<TE>   Souza's husband, she later explained, is in an armored battalion
based in the Kuwaiti desert just over Iraq's southern border. He'll
be there until March. She is stationed for six months at another
Qatari base that also would be central to any military operations
against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "So I have a special interest in what's going on," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In a holiday season punctuated by drumbeats of war from Washington
and with more than 50,000 American troops already deployed throughout
the Persian Gulf, many here share her concerns -- even the supreme
commander of all those forces.</TE>
<TE>   It is, Franks said at the town meeting, "perhaps the most
stressful time that any of us have seen in our lives."</TE>
<TE>   As yet, war has been just a game here this week -- a computer war
simulation run out of a $58-million high-tech mobile command center
tucked away in an identical warehouse adjacent to the town meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed Internal Look, it is the first command-and-control exercise
the U.S. military has staged abroad, and Franks called it a
centerpiece of the transformation to a lighter, more rapidly
deployable force.</TE>
<TE>   To demonstrate how well it is going, Franks and his senior
commanders brought members of the press to As Sayliyah and allowed
them the first tour of the Command Deployable Headquarters. Raytheon
Corp. built the center in the U.S., flew it 7,000 miles to Qatar,
where it was assembled inside this bunkered army base more than a
month ago.</TE>
<TE>   The facility, which mirrors Franks' headquarters in Tampa, Fla.,
can be broken down and packed up in less than two weeks and flown
anywhere in the 25 African, Middle Eastern and Southwestern Asian
nations in his command area, senior officials said.</TE>
<TE>   A labyrinth of long, semicircular tents and room-sized
military-style modules similar to shipping containers, the command
fills one of 33 anonymous, sand-colored warehouses here. Each
warehouse is longer than a football field, and together they occupy
most of the 262-acre As Sayliyah base.</TE>
<TE>   The main war room is inside a module in the heart of the
warehouse, beyond a barbed-wire fence and a tent where intelligence
gathered from around the world is compiled; the tent is protected
from electronic eavesdropping by a constant stream of "white noise"
music. On Thursday, there were Christmas carols.</TE>
<TE>   Military commanders call the Joint Operations Center "the nerve
cell" -- the brain trust that would coordinate any attack on Iraq.
And it is located just 700 miles south of Baghdad -- a 60-by-20-foot,
fluorescent-white room that is staffed by about 40 officers from the
Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Special Operations.</TE>
<TE>   Seated before four large war screens Thursday, the officers were
entering the second phase of the computer war games that began Monday
and continue through the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The exercise, Franks said, is a clear sign that America is ready
to fight what he called "the first war of the 21st century" -- the
global war on terrorism. The command, control and communications
drill is also designed to test the hardware and software and to find
holes in its ability to wage war.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the prospect of the real thing that shadowed the
exercise, the press tour and Rumsfeld's 24-hour visit to Qatar. Yet
at every step, the defense secretary was uncharacteristically muted
on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   From the podium of a stage fashioned from flatbed trucks and
flanked by Humvees, Rumsfeld told Capt. Souza that it will take time
to pore over what he said was as many as 24,000 pages of Iraq's
declaration outlining its weapons of mass destruction programs.</TE>
<TE>   "In fairness to the process, it would be kind of out of line for
me to opine as to what it might turn out to be," Rumsfeld said of a
final verdict on whether Iraq has come clean.</TE>
<TE>   "Time will tell."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the secretary focused largely on America's continuing
"unconventional" global war on terrorism, which was the theme of a
four-nation tour that ended when he departed As Sayliyah for
Washington on Thursday evening.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld also thanked the troops for sacrificing their holidays
with family.</TE>
<TE>   "You are what stands between our people, the American people ...
and an evil that cannot be appeased, that cannot be ignored and must
not be allowed to win," he told them.</TE>

<HD>Turkey's Bid for Early Talks on EU Entry Fails</HD>
<DH>The nation wanted to start negotiations next year but will
have to wait at least until 2005. Bloc is expected to endorse its
largest expansion ever.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Holley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>COPENHAGEN</DL>
<LD>European Union leaders Thursday held out the prospect of membership
to Turkey but dashed the country's hopes for early talks.</LD>
<LD>   If Turkey is found in a December 2004 review to qualify under EU
criteria for human rights and democracy, accession talks would begin
"as soon as possible," Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen
said in announcing the decision.</LD>
<LD>   He implied that negotiations would begin in early 2005, assuming
the predominantly Muslim nation meets political requirements. Turkey,
with the backing of the United States, had hoped talks would begin
next year.</LD>
<TE>   The action came on the first day of a summit expected to endorse
the largest expansion in EU history, with agreement on terms for 10
new members, including eight from former Communist states. Applicants
led by Poland were negotiating down to the wire, demanding more
generous terms to help them catch up with the richer countries of
Western Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The summit also was wrestling with the thorny issue of how to
welcome ethnically divided Cyprus into the European Union. Cyprus has
been split since a 1974 Turkish invasion, which was triggered by a
Greek Cypriot coup backed by the military junta then ruling Greece.
U.N.-brokered negotiations are trying to find a solution.</TE>
<TE>   Passions have been rising over the issue of allowing Turkey to
become the first Muslim country to join the organization of
predominantly Christian countries. The timing is especially sensitive
since the U.S. is courting Turkey's help if there is a war against
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to stress that we aim at sending a positive signal to
Turkey," said Rasmussen, whose country currently holds the EU
presidency. But he acknowledged it was uncertain how the offer would
be seen. "I hope the Turkish government will receive the signal in
the spirit in which it is sent."</TE>
<TE>   Turkish Prime Minister Abdullah Gul has insisted that recent
democratic reforms already make the country ready for membership
negotiations. He had lobbied hard for talks to start in 2003,
declaring before the summit that "it's our right to get a very firm,
clear date to start the negotiations."</TE>
<TE>   British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw described the interlocking
talks over Cyprus, Turkey's entry bid and financial terms for new
members as "the most complex matrix of negotiations in which the EU
has ever been involved."</TE>
<TE>   Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia,
Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Cyprus and Malta are expected to conclude
negotiations at the two-day summit under a deal that would make them
members in spring 2004. The summit is also expected to support
Bulgaria's and Romania's hopes for entry in 2007.</TE>
<TE>   EU leaders want Turkey to help engineer reunification of Cyprus,
and to refrain from taking any action if the internationally
recognized Greek-ruled part of the island receives a separate
invitation to join. Turkish Cypriots would be able to join later if
they accept a reunification plan.</TE>
<TE>   Financial negotiations were focused on a proposed $41-billion
package to support new members. Candidates are seeking the full $43
billion originally budgeted for expansion. The EU's key contributors,
led by Germany, say they cannot afford that because of an economic
slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   Poland has led applicants arguing that more money should go to
farmers and to build infrastructure such as roads and telephone
networks. Financial disputes were expected to be worked out today.</TE>
<TE>   Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski told reporters in Warsaw
on Thursday that the summit aims to build a "Europe united, free of
20th century divisions, a Europe able to take full advantage of its
opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   Some supporters of Turkey charge that the hesitancy to welcome it
is based not on questions of democracy or economic development but
rather on its religion. Some want to let it join in part to disprove
the charge that the European Union is a Christian club.</TE>
<TE>   But others question the wisdom of bringing in such a large and
relatively poor country with significant cultural differences from
most of Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the former French president heading an
effort to draw up a new EU constitution, told the French newspaper Le
Monde last month that Turkey's membership would mean the end of the
European Union.</TE>
<TE>   "Its capital is not in Europe, 95% of its population is outside
Europe, it is not a European country," D'Estaing said. Turkey, he
added, has "a different culture, a different approach, a different
way of life." He claimed that most EU states were privately against
admitting Turkey, but "they never say it to the Turks."</TE>
<TE>   Turkey is concerned that new members, fearing competition from a
large and low-wage country, might be even less supportive of its
entry than are the richer countries of Western Europe.</TE>
<TE>   But Jan Kulakowski, Poland's former chief EU negotiator and now a
presidential advisor on EU integration, said it is better "to see
Turkey in the European Union rather than in the bloc of
fundamentalist Islamic countries."</TE>

<LD>An American Black Hawk helicopter crashed in the hills of central
Honduras during a night training exercise, killing five U.S.
soldiers, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The helicopter, from Soto Cano Air Base in Palmerola, crashed
about 9 p.m. Wednesday, said Lt. Col. Bill Costello, a spokesman for
the U.S. Southern Command in Florida.</LD>
<LD>   The crew belonged to the 1st Battalion, 228th Aviation Regiment,
based at Ft. Buchanan, Puerto Rico. "We are classifying it as a

<HD>Experts Visit Alleged Scud Factory in Iraq</HD>
<DH>As U.N. teams continue inspection, Baghdad again denies
having any Al-Hussein missiles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>U.N. experts combed seven sites in Iraq for banned weapons Thursday,
including a plant said to have made modified Scud missiles, and
attended a test launch of a short-range ballistic missile.</LD>
<LD>   Iraq again vehemently denied that it has any Scud missiles left,
or any weapons of mass destruction, and gave rare praise to what it
said was the professionalism of the U.N. teams.</LD>
<LD>   Experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency drove to Al
Nidaa Public Company in Zafaraniyah, a suburb of Baghdad. The
facility, run by Iraq's Military Industrialization Commission,
produces metal molds and tools.</LD>
<TE>   According to a report by United Nations inspectors who left Iraq
in 1998, the facility was used to produce Al-Hussein missiles, an
Iraqi variation of the Soviet Scud B missile.</TE>
<TE>   Al Nidaa, built in 1990, was bombed in 1993 and again in 1998 by
Western planes.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, we have no Scud missiles, absolutely," said Gen.
Hussam Mohammed Amin, an Iraqi official serving as a liaison with the
inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Amin praised the inspectors' work, saying: "We appreciate the
professionalism with which the inspections are undertaken. Although
some of the questions are repeated, there are no silly questions."</TE>
<TE>   At the missile test pad, about 120 miles west of Baghdad, a U.N.
team attended a test launch of a short-range ballistic missile being
developed by Iraq. The missile range falls within that allowed under
U.N. resolutions, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Iraq for the first time invited to Baghdad the U.N.
envoy in charge of accounting for stolen Kuwaiti property and
prisoners of war from Iraq's 1990-91 occupation of its southern
neighbor, a U.N. official said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Until now Iraq had boycotted talks with the envoy, Russia's former
U.N. ambassador, Yuli M. Vorontsov.</TE>

<HD>7 Palestinians, 2 Israelis Die in Violence</HD>
<DH>In one incident, soldiers kill five unarmed men on Gaza
border. Army suspects they were infiltrators; others say they were
job seekers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>Under disputed circumstances, the Israeli army killed five unarmed
Palestinians who were crawling on their bellies before dawn Thursday
toward the high barbed-wire barrier that separates the Gaza Strip
from Israel.</LD>
<LD>   In another incident, a Palestinian militant was shot dead by
Israeli troops while trying to cut the fence surrounding a Jewish
settlement in the central Gaza Strip. Ammunition, guns and hand
grenades were recovered at the scene, and a Palestinian faction, the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, claimed responsibility
for the attempted infiltration early Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   A seventh Palestinian, armed with an assault rifle and disguised
in an Israeli army uniform, was killed Thursday evening by army
troops after crossing into southern Israel from the Gaza Strip, the
army said.</LD>
<TE>   In the volatile, violent West Bank town of Hebron, two members of
Israel's paramilitary border police, one of them a woman, were shot
and killed Thursday night by Palestinian gunmen, the army said. The
two were guarding a post near a disputed shrine, the Tomb of the
Patriarchs.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all the Israeli troops in Hebron are men, but the border
police have a few mixed units.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting occurred not far from where 12 Israeli soldiers and
security men from a Hebron-area settlement were killed last month in
a Palestinian ambush. That attack happened along a pathway leading to
the Tomb of the Patriarchs, which tradition holds is the burial site
of the biblical Abraham.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army has maintained a heavy presence in the area since
the Nov. 15 attack.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians said the five men slain in Gaza, who were dragging a
pair of long ladders, most likely were workers trying to scale the
fence and sneak into Israel for badly needed jobs. The army suggested
that even though no weapons were discovered on or near the dead men,
they might have been the leading edge of an infiltration effort by an
armed group to follow.</TE>
<TE>   The men were spotted by Israeli soldiers using night-vision
equipment at an observation post near the Karni crossing, southeast
of Gaza City, the army said. Access along the fence is tightly
restricted, so the group's clandestine presence in the area in the
middle of the night was automatically considered to be a threat, an
army spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians, however, pointed out that the men, whose identities
were still not known by late Thursday, were killed under
circumstances strikingly similar to those of three would-be workers
who died earlier this year trying sneak into Israel from Gaza. No
connection was ever established between those men and any Palestinian
militant group, and their families eventually came forward to say the
men had simply hoped to get across the fence and find work.</TE>
<TE>   Unemployment in the Palestinian territories, particularly the Gaza
Strip, has soared in the course of the 26-month-old intifada, with
some estimates putting the jobless rate at 70% or higher. Gaza's
economy was hardly robust before the fighting began, and it is badly
battered now, with most of the population sunk in poverty.</TE>
<TE>   By tradition, Palestinian families are large. In conversations
about their daily lives, Palestinian men in Gaza often speak of their
willingness to take enormous risks to procure work to feed their
families.</TE>
<TE>   Before the intifada and a wave of suicide attacks against
Israelis, tens of thousands of Palestinians had permission to travel
daily to jobs inside Israel. The work available to them was almost
always menial labor, usually on construction sites, but paid far more
than the men could have made at home, if there were even jobs
available.</TE>
<TE>   Army spokesman Capt. Jacob Dallal said soldiers guarding the Gaza
fence Thursday were particularly vigilant, having received a specific
intelligence warning about a potential infiltration in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "So they saw a group of people crawling exactly as terrorists
would do, approaching the fence," he said. "The area is completely
off limits -- no one is supposed to be there, let alone late at
night, and obviously this area has seen infiltration attempts.... All
the indications suggested they were doing something they should not
have been doing."</TE>
<TE>   Gaza, in contrast to the West Bank, has long been fenced off from
Israel to prevent militants from slipping across. A similar and much
longer barrier is in the works to separate the West Bank from Israel
proper.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, an Israeli court rejected an attempt by Marwan
Barghouti, a leader of the Palestinian uprising, to win his release
from detention. The court in Tel Aviv ruled that it had the right to
try Barghouti, who has claimed that Israeli legal proceedings against
him are illegitimate.</TE>
<TE>   Barghouti, 43, who has been jailed since April, is accused of
plotting attacks that killed more than two dozen Israeli civilians.
He denies the charges.</TE>

<DL>MANAGUA, Nicaragua</DL>
<LD>Lawmakers stripped former Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman of his
immunity from prosecution Thursday, clearing the way for him to face
charges that he stole nearly $100 million in public funds.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, approved by a 47-45 vote, marked the first time in
Nicaragua that presidential immunity has been revoked. Nine members
of Aleman's ruling Constitutionalist Liberal Party supported the
motion, while the rest of the lawmakers in his party -- including
Aleman himself -- voted against it.</LD>
<LD>   President Enrique Bolanos served as Aleman's vice president, but
succeeded him in January pledging to clean up the country's corrupt
government, a campaign that has put him at odds with his predecessor.</LD>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors allege that the former president diverted
nearly $100 million in state funds to Panamanian bank accounts
controlled by his family and then funneled the money to his party's
candidates. Aleman has denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Aleman became a lawmaker after his four-year presidential term,
and Thursday's vote did not remove him from the legislature. It does
ensure that prosecutors will take him to trial.</TE>

<HD>N. Korea Plans to Reopen Nuclear Power Facilities</HD>
<DH>Regime demands the removal of monitoring gear. The move
would enable it to access, undetected, plutonium to make weapons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Demick, Sonni Efron and Alissa J. Rubin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The United States and North Korea marched toward a diplomatic crisis
Thursday when the isolated Communist regime said it would reopen
shuttered nuclear power facilities and asked the International Atomic
Energy Agency to remove monitoring cameras and seals from all of its
nuclear facilities.</LD>
<LD>   If implemented, the move would make it more difficult for the
international community to know whether North Korea was tapping into
its plutonium stockpiles to make nuclear weapons. The CIA has
estimated that North Korea already has one or two nuclear devices and
could make many more by mid-decade if it used the plutonium at the
facilities.</LD>
<LD>   "We view this as a very serious matter," a senior U.S.
administration official said late Thursday. "We regret North Korea
has decided to make this request. We are consulting with the IAEA and
other countries, and we hope North Korea reconsiders their request."</LD>
<TE>   The North Korean announcement came on the heels of the seizure and
subsequent release of a ship carrying North Korean-made Scud missiles
to Yemen, a move that the regime in Pyongyang, the North's capital,
called "unpardonable piracy that wantonly encroached upon" its
sovereignty.</TE>
<TE>   The regime said that its hand was forced by a decision last month
by the United States and its allies to suspend donations of fuel oil
to the power-starved nation. The fuel-oil deliveries, which were cut
off after North Korea admitted to a secret uranium-enrichment
program, were part of a 1994 agreement that required Pyongyang to
give up its nuclear ambitions in exchange for energy assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "With the United States abandoning its responsibility, we now face
a discrepancy in our electricity generation plan," said a statement
attributed to an unnamed North Korean Foreign Ministry official, who
was quoted by the official Korean Central News Agency. As a result,
North Korea said it would "immediately resume operation and
construction of nuclear facilities."</TE>
<TE>   North Korea did not go so far Thursday as to order the IAEA staff
at the sprawling Yongbyon nuclear complex in question to leave.</TE>
<TE>   But the demand to remove the monitoring equipment was seen as
especially troubling because it would make it difficult to know
whether North Korea was opening any of the 8,000 sealed and canned
spent fuel rods at the facility and extracting or reprocessing the
plutonium.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's reaction was relatively mild Thursday until it heard
about North Korea's demand to remove the cameras from the nuclear
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "The dangerous thing about the request to remove the cameras is,
it comes pretty close to a clear admission that they are indeed doing
illicit activities," said North Korea expert L. Gordon Flake,
executive director of the Mansfield Center for Pacific Affairs in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're not doing anything wrong ... why do you care about the
cameras?"</TE>
<TE>   IAEA head Mohammed Baradei sent a letter back Thursday urging
North Korea "to act with restraint in this tense situation and not to
take any unilateral action" that would make it difficult for IAEA
inspectors to continue monitoring the North Korean facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Baradei also asked North Korea to agree to an urgent meeting of
technical experts to discuss monitoring.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea is known for its bold tactics in clamoring for
international attention -- and the Bush administration for its
refusal to compromise with Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   "It's brinkmanship, plain and simple," Flake said, adding, "I am
increasingly alarmed that [the Bush] administration won't blink."</TE>
<TE>   Retired Col. William M. Drennan, a Korea expert at the U.S.
Institute of Peace in Washington, said of the North Koreans: "It's
not that they're genetically incapable of backing down, though it is
rare.... They will back down if they calculate it is their interest
to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Cho Myong Chul, a prominent North Korean defector who now works as
an economist in Seoul, said that the North Koreans appear to be
prodding the Bush administration toward a crisis sooner rather than
later with the calculation that they will have more bargaining power
when the United States is preoccupied with Iraq."If they wait for the
U.S. attack on Iraq to be completed, their room to maneuver will not
be as effective," Cho said. "North Korea is clearly very upset, but
they are calculating as well. I think they will want to negotiate.
They will not start opening the reactor tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   "Their objective is to get us to negotiate with them," agreed
Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution in Washington, noting
that the North Koreans know the United States is preoccupied with
Iraq and Afghanistan. "They know right now that we don't want to
think about them more than necessary, and not talk to them for a
while.... And here is their one way of saying ... 'You have to deal
with us now.' "</TE>
<TE>   North Korea's nuclear ambitions precipitated a serious diplomatic
crisis with the U.S. in 1994, which ended in that year's deal, known
as the Agreed Framework.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, North Korea would freeze its nuclear
facilities and allow IAEA monitoring; Japan and the European Union
would pay for construction of two new, less proliferation-prone
light-water nuclear reactors for North Korea; and the United States
would supply fuel oil to the energy-starved nation for the time it
would take to build the plant. But the Agreed Framework is now
unraveling.</TE>
<TE>   A major point of concern is the Yongbyon complex, 55 miles north
of Pyongyang. The complex contains a 5-megawatt, Soviet-designed
nuclear reactor that is too small to generate significant quantities
of power but was nevertheless capable of producing weapons-grade
plutonium.</TE>
<TE>   South Korean sources said it could be restarted in perhaps two
months, although other analysts expressed doubt that the rusty,
obsolete plant would work. Even if it was fired up and connected to
North Korea's fragile power grid, the plant would produce an
insignificant amount of electricity -- nowhere near enough to help
the country endure its cold winter.</TE>
<TE>   "But it can produce plutonium," an IAEA official said.</TE>
<TE>   Spent fuel rods from that plant have been monitored by the IAEA
since 1994. At the time of the freeze, the North Koreans had two
other nuclear plants that were under construction -- a 50-megawatt
unit in Yongbyon and a 200-megawatt unit in Taechon that would be
large enough to supply electricity to the power-starved nation.</TE>
<TE>   It would take North Korea two years to finish construction on the
two larger reactors, said the IAEA official, who asked not to be
named.</TE>
<TE>   The need for energy to replace the suspended fuel oil shipments
does not explain North Korea's demand for restarting or removing
monitoring equipment at the plutonium reprocessing facility, which
does not produce energy. That move was instantly understood in
Washington, Seoul and Vienna, where the IAEA is based, as a shot
across the bow of the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   "The North Koreans have been muddling the last two months without
doing anything but throwing out rhetoric against the United
States.... Now they are really angry," said Kim Tae Woo, an analyst
at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses.</TE>
<TE>   Before the North Koreans demanded the removal of monitoring
equipment, the Bush administration apparently had concluded that it
would let the North Koreans stew in their own juices in the hope that
leader Kim Jong Il would realize that the Bush administration would
not give in, as it had accused the Clinton administration of doing.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Thursday, National Security Council spokesman Sean
McCormack said the North's declaration on resuming nuclear operations
was "regrettable," but he repeated language designed to reassure Kim
that the U.S. is not about to attack and holding out the promise of
better relations if the North gives up its nuclear ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   "As the president has said, we have no intentions of invading the
DPRK," the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, McCormack said,
using the formal name of the North. "The international community has
made it clear that North Korea's relations with the outside world
hinge on the elimination of its nuclear weapons program.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. has always been open to dialogue in principle and was
prepared for a comprehensive approach to improving U.S.-DPRK
relations before the disclosure of the DPRK's clandestine
uranium-enrichment program," McCormack added. "However, the U.S. will
not enter into dialogue in response to threats or broken commitments,
and we will not bargain or offer inducements for North Korea to live
up to the treaties and agreements it has signed."</TE>
<TE>   Today, the North's Foreign Ministry demanded an apology from the
U.S. for seizing the missile-laden ship and said it had a right to
produce missiles and export them for profit.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States should apologize ... and duly compensate for
all the mental and material damage done to the ship and its crew," it
said in a statement reported by the KCNA.</TE>
<TE>   The ship was "carrying missile components and some building
materials" under a legal contract with Yemen, it said, adding that
the North "has already clarified that it is not only producing
missiles to defend itself from the U.S. ... but exporting them to
earn foreign currency."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage dismissed the
demand. "An unflagged, stateless ship carrying contraband cargo, we
had every right to stop it," he told reporters during a visit to
Sydney. "We searched it, we found the papers in disorder, established
this fact for the whole world and then let the shipment continue, so
I find the statement absurd."</TE>
<TE>   Although analysts of North Korea commended the Bush
administration's general consistency and unity in its message to
North Korea, many worried whether it was going far enough in offering
Pyongyang a face-saving opportunity for a negotiated settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "North Korea is not going to capitulate on issues of vital
national security for them," said Joel Wit, a former State Department
expert on Korea now at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington. "We do have to be tough with them, but we have
to use every measure available to us to resolve the situation. That
means at some point we are going to have to sit down with them."</TE>
<TE>   And while there is time to negotiate, once North Korea fires up
its new plants, the U.S. options for a preemptive strike on North
Korea become even less palatable than they were in 1994, O'Hanlon
said. "Once it gets started, it will be difficult to hit it with a
laser-guided bomb because you risk spewing out radioactivity," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The South Korean government released a statement expressing
"strong regret and dismay," after a three-hour emergency meeting of
the country's National Security Council on Thursday night. The North
Korean declaration was also condemned by the South's two leading
candidates for president.</TE>

<HD>Iraq Breaks Deal With Russian Oil Company</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Iraq has scrapped a $3.5-billion oil field deal with Russia's Lukoil,
the company said Thursday, a major economic reversal there for Russia
at a time when both Baghdad and Washington are courting Moscow's
support in the event of war.</LD>
<LD>   Lukoil, which leads the group tapped to develop the massive West
Qurnah oil field, said it had received a letter Monday from a deputy
Iraqi oil minister breaking the 23-year contract.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for Lukoil, Alexander Vasilenko, denounced the move as
"blackmail" and said the firms would fight the decision in court.</LD>
<TE>   "We do not understand how a petty bureaucrat from Iraq's oil
ministry can cancel up a law that has been passed by Iraq's
parliament," Vasilenko said.</TE>
<TE>   "Lukoil will take all appropriate action to defend its rights,"
the company said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The West Qurnah deal is by far the most significant oil
development project undertaken in Iraq by Russian companies, but it
has been stalled by continuing U.N. sanctions. The Iraqis have
pressured Lukoil to defy the sanctions and begin work, but it has
refused.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Rashid Mohammed Ubaydi, attending an OPEC
meeting in Vienna, would say only that contracts were liable to
cancellation if companies did not fulfill their drilling obligations.</TE>
<TE>   "Any company that does not fulfill their obligation over a long
time, then we will be free to cancel their contract," he said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Push for Broader Democratic Reforms in Arab World</HD>
<DH>Powell says aid initiative will focus on economic and
educational development in Mideast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a bid to balance the growing U.S. military presence in the Middle
East with a more active political role, Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell on Thursday announced a new Bush administration initiative to
press for greater democracy, economic openings and education reform
in the Arab world.</LD>
<LD>   "It has become increasingly clear that we must broaden our
approach to the region if we are to achieve success. We must work
with peoples and governments to close the gulf between expectation
and reality -- called the hope gap," Powell said in a speech to the
conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   "Any approach to the Middle East that ignores its political,
economic and educational underdevelopment will be built upon sand,"
he said.</LD>
<TE>   Powell's speech, which offered few details, comes at a time when
the administration is under fire for letting the U.S.-declared war on
terrorism and a possible invasion of Iraq overshadow attention to the
region's underlying political and economic problems.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. diplomats point to the dearth of democracy in the Arab world
as a critical factor breeding Islamic extremism, but the war on
terrorism has led Washington to "put aside its democratic scruples
and seek closer ties with autocracies throughout the Middle East and
Asia," says Thomas Carothers of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace in the upcoming issue of Foreign Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Powell's remarks -- and two earlier speeches by CIA Director
George J. Tenet and Richard Haass, the State Department's director of
policy planning -- were also meant to lay out a vision of how the
United States hopes to interact with more than 50 countries in the
Islamic world, stretching from Morocco to Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech to the Nixon Center on Tuesday night, Tenet warned
that the United States cannot win the war on terrorism "simply by
defeating and dismantling Al Qaeda. To claim victory, we and our
allies will need to address the circumstances that bring peoples to
despair, weaken governments and create power vacuums that extremists
are all too ready to fill."</TE>
<TE>   Tenet also said the United States needs to have some candid
discussions with allies about the need to embrace democratic norms,
encourage moderate alternatives to radical Islam and to promote
opportunities for all Muslims, particularly women. "Friendship
without such honesty is a hollow thing indeed," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations last week, Haass said
that U.S. administrations, Republican and Democrat, have failed to
make the kind of democratization that has swept the rest of the world
a priority in the Islamic world.</TE>
<TE>   In the name of ensuring oil supplies, containing the Soviet Union,
Iran and Iraq, securing military bases and dealing with the
Arab-Israeli crisis, the United States created a "democratic
exception," Haass said -- and in the process missed opportunities to
build stable and prosperous partners.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not in our interest -- or that of the people living in the
Muslim world -- for the United States to continue this exception.
U.S. policy will be more actively engaged in supporting democratic
trends in the Muslim world than ever before," Haass said. To launch
the U.S.-Middle East Partnership, Powell announced an increase of $29
million in American aid on top of the more than $1 billion in
nonmilitary assistance that goes to the region. Additional funding is
expected next year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials acknowledge that $29 million is a drop in the
bucket for almost two dozen countries with a population totaling more
than 260 million people.</TE>
<TE>   Powell pledged that the United States will engage with both the
public and private sectors to help ease chronic unemployment in the
Arab world.</TE>
<TE>   "Hope begins with a paycheck," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   On the political front, Washington will seek partnerships with
community leaders to strengthen nongovernmental civil society,
encourage political participation and "lift the voices of women,"
Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   "We reject the condescending notion that freedom will not grow in
the Middle East, or that there is any region of the world that cannot
support democracy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The United States will seek to provide scholarships and help
create better schools and more opportunities for higher education,
again focusing particularly on girls.</TE>
<TE>   "When girls' literacy rates improve, all the other important
indicators of development in a country improve as well," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   Some Arab allies welcomed the initiative but faulted the timing.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been helpful to have done this earlier, although we
understand that there are regional issues that delayed the
announcement. But we're still glad it came," said one Arab envoy,
speaking on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's King Abdullah II said it is an important initiative and a
"positive step toward bridging the gap between the Arab world and the
United States."</TE>
<TE>   Egypt also praised the U.S. move. "The objectives raised --
liberalizing economies and enhancing education and expanding
democracy -- are all issues which are valid and we are working on
ourselves," said Nabil Fahmy, the Egyptian ambassador to the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   But he added that progress is required on the Arab-Israeli peace
process in order to defuse tensions and create an environment
conducive to change.</TE>

<HD>Spain's Military Upset With U.S. Over Ship</HD>
<DH>Madrid's forces had risked their lives to stop the vessel
only to see it released, officials note.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>MADRID</DL>
<LD>Spanish military officials voiced irritation with the United States
over the seizure of a ship carrying North Korean missiles to Yemen,
saying in reports published Thursday that Spanish naval forces risked
their lives for what proved to be a pointless exercise.</LD>
<LD>   The Defense Ministry sought to play down the reports in Spain's
two biggest daily newspapers, but a spokesman acknowledged that the
ministry was "a little surprised" by the U.S. decision to let the
Scud missiles go their way after asking Spain to stop the ship this
week in the Arabian Sea.</LD>
<LD>   The spokesman added that the Pentagon's No. 2 official, Paul D.
Wolfowitz, called Defense Minister Federico Trillo late Wednesday "to
thank and praise Spain for the operation and to apologize for what
could seem an absurd situation."</LD>
<TE>   Spanish Foreign Minister Ana Palacio said the U.S. decision to let
the ship go was correct. "Once all the details were checked and the
origin, destination and buyers were verified, and Yemen guaranteed
that these missiles were not going to pass into terrorist hands, we
were obliged to let the ship follow its course," Palacio told state
radio.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said Wednesday that Spanish authorities were deeply
involved in the awkward negotiations, as was Cambodia. The United
States said it had the right to stop and search the ship but not
confiscate the cargo because Yemen purchased the missiles legally.</TE>
<TE>   In published reports, unnamed Spanish military officials expressed
irritation. "The Spanish military forces risked their lives, and so
far we don't know why," the daily El Pais quoted one unidentified
Defense Ministry official as saying.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a change of tack toward Yemen that the United
States will have to explain," another military official told El Mundo
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   The Spanish operation included the firing of warning shots at the
freighter and its boarding by elite forces who rappelled from a
helicopter. U.S. and Cambodian officials said Thursday that the ship
was registered in Cambodia by North Korean owners.</TE>
<TE>   "The ship was owned by Chinese, then it was sold to North Koreans
who registered the ship with the Cambodian company in Singapore,"
Cambodian government spokesman Khieu Kanharith said. Cambodia
recently suspended the company's operations after criticism that the
vessels it registered were often engaged in criminal activities.</TE>

<HD>Venezuela Fires Strike Leaders</HD>
<DH>Government tries to end oil industry shutdown, but Chavez
opponents vow to continue protest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>President Hugo Chavez's government fired the leaders of an oil
industry shutdown in a bid Thursday to break an 11-day general strike
that has crippled Venezuela's petroleum exports.</LD>
<LD>   In a defiant response, oil industry strikers said they would not
return to work until Chavez resigned.</LD>
<LD>   The strike has halted exports from the state oil company Petroleos
de Venezuela, better known as PDVSA. Venezuela is the world's No. 5
petroleum exporter and supplies more than 10% of U.S. oil imports.</LD>
<TE>   The four fired PDVSA executives have coordinated the shutdown.
Others were transferred in an attempt to end the strike, which has
affected gasoline supplies, food distribution and other industries.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in a war situation, because we are being attacked,
sabotaged in our oil industry," Planning Minister Felipe Perez said.
"We are going to take tough measures."</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting in Caracas, the capital, several hundred striking
PDVSA employees chanted, "Not one step backward!" and vowed to keep
ports and refineries closed across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez opponents launched the strike Dec. 2, demanding a
nonbinding referendum on his rule. Chavez has refused, and they now
say they will end the strike only if he calls general elections, a
source close to the negotiations said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, an army colonel and a major added themselves to the
list of more than 100 dissident military officers who have called for
Chavez to step down.</TE>
<TE>   Col. Aguedo d'Hoy and Maj. Jesus d'Hoy -- who are brothers --
accused the president of indoctrinating the armed forces with leftist
ideals and arming bands called Bolivarian Circles to intimidate
dissenters. Chavez has denied those allegations.</TE>
<TE>   After a meeting with President Bush this week, Brazilian
President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva -- a Chavez friend and ally
-- called on Chavez to negotiate a settlement.</TE>

<HD>State Dealt Setback on Power Costs</HD>
<DH>Judge says California, seeking $9 billion in refunds,
instead owes firms $1.2 billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal regulatory judge found Thursday that energy companies
overcharged California utilities by $1.8 billion during the
electricity crisis -- far short of the $9 billion that Gov. Gray
Davis and others had demanded.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, according to the finding, it's the power suppliers that
are owed money -- $1.2 billion for unpaid bills.</LD>
<LD>   The initial finding by Judge Bruce Birchman of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission sparked angry denunciations from California
officials.</LD>
<TE>   "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rigged the rules," Davis
said at a news conference in Sacramento. "They threw out just about
everything we could claim."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he would continue to press the state's case before
FERC, in the political arena and in the courts. He said he would
write to President Bush demanding that FERC "do the right thing." He
added: "We want at least $9 billion back."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the setback, Davis promised that utility rates to
California consumers would fall within 24 months with the decline of
financing charges for emergency power purchases by the state. And he
emphasized that any refunds from generators would be used to further
reduce consumers' bills.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and other officials contend that the state's case for
refunds has been bolstered by new evidence showing that energy
companies took advantage of California's byzantine electric
deregulation scheme to game the market for higher profits.</TE>
<TE>   Birchman concluded that energy companies including Mirant Corp.,
Duke Energy Corp., Dynegy Inc. and Reliant Energy Inc. overcharged
California utilities such as Southern California Edison Co. and
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. $1.8 billion for electricity purchases
from Oct. 2, 2000, to June 20, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   That is the time frame he was directed to examine by the FERC
board after it concluded that power prices in California were "unjust
and unreasonable."</TE>
<TE>   Birchman based his finding on a hypothetical "just and reasonable"
price computed by taking into account fuel and other production
costs.</TE>
<TE>   But the judge also concluded that the companies still were owed $3
billion for power they delivered during this time of skyrocketing
energy costs and for which they have not been paid.</TE>
<TE>   The net result: The utilities owe the suppliers $1.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, that debt may be reduced by FERC -- by $500 million or
more -- according to energy lawyers who follow the case in
Washington. That's because the final decision rests not with the
judge but with the full FERC board. It will take into account any
evidence of market manipulation and artificially inflated prices for
natural gas, the chief fuel used to generate electricity.</TE>
<TE>   That additional evidence, still being developed by investigators,
was not presented in the narrow case before the judge. California
sued FERC in federal court to ensure that market manipulation would
be factored into the ultimate decision.</TE>
<TE>   Deliberations by the FERC board are expected in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   Birchman's findings filled more than 235 pages with arcane details
of the workings of the power business. More than 100 entities were
represented in the case, including power generators, government
agencies and public and private utilities. Exhibits took up more than
20 feet of shelf space.</TE>
<TE>   The $1.8-billion figure "is well within the range of what was
expected," said Roger Berliner, a Washington energy lawyer with
Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips who is representing Los Angeles County in
the case.</TE>
<TE>   An appendix to the ruling, captioned "Who Owes What To Whom,"
provided a rough accounting for each company.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Birchman found that Duke overcharged by $71.5
million. But it was owed $265 million. The net result: Duke still is
owed $193.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Mullen, a Duke spokesman, said the judge's finding "confirms
that Duke Energy is owed substantially more ... than could ever be
credited back to the state."</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that the judge's findings will move the refund
issue any closer to finality, Duke Energy considers that a positive
step," Mullen said.</TE>
<TE>   Other firms said they also were pleased with the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The recommended $1.8-billion refund "is a fairly significant
number," said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of Independent
Energy Producers, a trade group representing California generators.
"The state should ... declare victory and go home."</TE>
<TE>   One of the main reasons California and FERC are so far apart on
refunds is that the state says consideration should include power
charges dating to early 2000, instead of the fall of that year. That
change could garner the state $2 billion, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   FERC's board, however, has said it has no legal authority to
consider a broader time frame for refunds. The Oct. 2, 2000, starting
date was determined by the date on which the first complaint of
overcharges was filed, FERC officials say.</TE>
<TE>   FERC also refused to consider ordering refunds for electricity
purchases by the state Department of Water Resources on behalf of the
cash-strapped utilities, on the grounds that the state agency was not
a utility. Davis called that "an artificial constraint that makes no
sense" and said it cost the state $3.4 billion in refunds.</TE>
<TE>   Last July, FERC decided that California could not offer evidence
of market manipulation. But the ruling was overturned by a federal
appeals court, and the state is assembling that information and
preparing to submit it next year.</TE>
<TE>   Other state officials echoed the governor's criticism of FERC.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me get this straight -- the judge found California ratepayers
were indeed ripped off, but at the end of the day, they still owe the
energy generators $1.2 billion?" said Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del
Rey), chairwoman of the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications
Committee. "I hope FERC and the generators aren't holding their
breath, waiting for that check to be cut."</TE>
<TE>   Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities
Commission, said: "FERC's awarding of $1.8 billion is merely a slap
on the wrist to the energy companies that illegally lined their
pockets at California ratepayers' expense. FERC must not approve a
proposed decision that defies logic and rewards criminal behavior."</TE>
<TE>   FERC officials counter that such criticism is unfair, given that
the agency now is committed to aggressively policing the energy
markets.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Dresslar, a spokesman for California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer,
said the decision was "not all bad."</TE>
<TE>   "It's obviously, in terms of the $1.8 billion, not the number that
we think is accurate," he said. But several of the findings bolster
the state's case, "so it's something we can build on."</TE>

<HD>Blind Seer Is Still Stargazing</HD>
<DH>Astrologer Sydney Omarr, 76 and paralyzed by multiple
sclerosis, hasn't lost his elegant flair for divining the future in
the planets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Louis Sahagun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's an early Thursday afternoon and the world's most widely read
astrologer is busy divining the future.</LD>
<LD>   Lying in bed with his head propped up on pillows, Sydney Omarr,
blinded and paralyzed from the neck down by multiple sclerosis, waits
for a cue from his editorial advisor, Capricorn Valerie Barbeaux.</LD>
<LD>   Seated before an old IBM Selectric II typewriter prepped with a
blank sheet and carbon paper, Barbeaux says, "Syd, this is for
Friday, Dec. 6 ... moon in Capricorn. Aries."</LD>
<TE>   His blue eyes begin to dart back and forth as though reading a
scroll unfurled in midair.</TE>
<TE>   "Expect some changes in connection with business, career," he says
in a monotone. "Written word plays major role; get ideas on paper."</TE>
<TE>   "We need another line, Syd."</TE>
<TE>   After a moment, the 76-year-old astrologer says, "Flirtation
begins innocently but could become hot and heavy."</TE>
<TE>   At Omarr's Westside apartment, where the walls are covered with
framed photos of him posing with friends and celebrities, from sexpot
actress Aries Jayne Mansfield to controversial author Capricorn Henry
Miller, it was just the beginning of what would be another busy day
in Omarr's 61-year career as an interpreter of the starry firmament.</TE>
<TE>   In an adjacent room, assistant and friend Sagittarius Paul Smalls
was organizing Omarr's daily pay-per-call telephonic astrological
forecasts, and assembling material for the 13 books -- one for each
sign of the zodiac and one for the entire year -- that his boss
writes annually. His books have sold more than 50 million copies
worldwide, making him a wealthy man.</TE>
<TE>   He also was fielding calls from Omarr's prospective dinner guests,
adoring women and his bookie.</TE>
<TE>   A warm blanket draped across his bone-thin shoulders, Omarr
struggled to catch his breath, then smiled with an explanation:
"About those adoring women: It's the astrology they're in love with,
not me."</TE>
<TE>   As for the gambling, "I win more than I lose."</TE>
<TE>   Well, of course.</TE>
<TE>   Would anything else be expected of a man who has worked so hard to
promote the ancient practice of divining a person's future from the
juxtaposition of the sun, moon and planets?</TE>
<TE>   Would anything else be expected of a man who, even when he was a
teenager, worked so hard to promote himself?</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Sydney Omarr has made himself the horoscope master to the
masses. He's also been a consultant of the rich and famous. A bon
vivant. A gambler. And survivor.</TE>
<TE>   His own horoscope indicates that, with Jupiter in the fifth house,
he is poised for success through publicity and entertainment. Perhaps
that's why he's now doing something he hasn't done in years -- grant
an interview.</TE>
<TE>   He comes off as confident yet modest, spiritual yet rebellious,
part mystic, part ordinary Joe -- anything but the herbal tea-sipping
soul one might expect. Instead, this Leo in winter still caps his
workday the way he always has -- with a hard-earned shot of good
Scotch and a hand-rolled cigar.</TE>
<TE>   Astrologers, of course, are not for everybody. Pagans, some call
them. Con men, say others.</TE>
<TE>   Since losing his sight a decade ago to the disease that was
diagnosed in 1971, Omarr, whose column appears in more than 200 daily
newspapers, has kept a low public profile.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as his physical foundations erode to painfully diminished
levels, Omarr is once again speaking out on his favorite subject.</TE>
<TE>   Just don't ask him how it works. He's not exactly sure.</TE>
<TE>   "No one knows what gravity is either," he likes to say, "but we
don't fear falling off the world."</TE>
<TE>   With an ear cocked toward a television in his den tuned to a
baseball game on which he had placed a significant wager, Omarr
turned briefly introspective: "I wish I'd taken better care of
myself. I wish I'd boxed more. I wish I had children."</TE>
<TE>   Then Omarr, who has a tough time staying serious, excused himself
to take a call from a "certain representative of a bookmaking
concern."</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, Barbara Snader, a former paramour who recently
died of cancer, suggested they write each others' obituaries.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Syd, I'll write, He was a scholar and a gentleman' " she
recalled in an interview shortly before her death. "He said, 'No. I
want you to say, He was a defender of astrology.' "</TE>
<TE>   Snader added with a laugh: "He wrote mine, but I didn't like it
because it began with the word 'seductive.' "</TE>
<TE>   Omarr was born Sidney Kimmelman at 10:27 a.m. Aug. 5, 1926, in
Philadelphia, with the sun, Mercury and Neptune all in Leo, and Libra
on the ascendant.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, he is by nature fiery and romantic, and a glutton
for attention, with a particularly strong need to be cooed at and
cuddled. Even as a boy, he was fascinated with magic, spending his
money on magical accouterments and books about the mystical arts.</TE>
<TE>   At 15, he already was performing sleight-of-hand tricks in magic
shops and local talent shows when he saw a movie called "Shanghai
Gesture" starring Victor Mature as a character named Omar -- with one
R.</TE>
<TE>   In accordance with certain numerological formulas, he added
another Y to his first name and a second R to Omar to add pizazz to
his life and career.</TE>
<TE>   The same year, he wrote his first book and, although he wasn't yet
a brand name, called it "Sydney Omarr's Private Course on
Numerology." He sold mimeographed copies for $2.</TE>
<TE>   Omarr doesn't remember how many he sold, but the book gave him a
start, and he began analyzing the horoscopes of film stars, such as
Sagittarius Edward G. Robinson, for movie magazines.</TE>
<TE>   He became a contributor to astrology magazines, which, in lieu of
payment, let him place two-inch advertisements encouraging readers to
send him their birth dates, a small fee, and a personal problem for
him to untangle.</TE>
<TE>   "When I started out, it was, 'Send me a dollar and a birth date
and I'll solve any problem,' " he said. "My father, Harry, a grocer,
and mother, Rose, a housewife, stopped worrying about me when the
checks started coming in."</TE>
<TE>   At 17, he enlisted in the Army. A year later, he was transferred
to Okinawa, where he became the first and only GI assigned astrology
duty.</TE>
<TE>   His weekly Armed Forces Radio program -- "Sydney Omarr's Almanac"
-- predicted the outcomes of professional boxing matches and horse
races and was heard throughout the Pacific Theater.</TE>
<TE>   After the service, he attended journalism courses at Mexico City
College and went on to become a reporter for United Press. One of his
first assignments was to interview the governor of California at the
time, Sagittarius Goodwin Knight, about some pending legislation.</TE>
<TE>   When Omarr called and introduced himself, Knight shot back, "Are
you the Sydney Omarr I've been reading for years? Come on over to the
office."</TE>
<TE>   Knight ordered everyone out of the room, then he proudly showed
Omarr his secret file of horoscopes of all his political friends and
foes.</TE>
<TE>   "We quickly became good friends," Omarr recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Omarr went on to spend a decade as a radio news editor in
Hollywood before becoming a full-time columnist and confidant to the
likes of actors Aquarius Kim Novak, Leo Mae West and Libra Rita
Hayworth.</TE>
<TE>   Jazz trumpeter Libra Dizzy Gillespie once asked Omarr to give him
a reading out loud. "When I finished," Omarr recalled, "Dizzy said,
'Man, you sure can wail!' "</TE>
<TE>   Omarr's proudest moment was his three-hour debate on Philadelphia
radio station WPEN the night of June 21, 1951, with astronomer Roy K.
Marshall, then director of the Fels Planetarium. The confrontation
brought Omarr to the attention of astronomers and science writers,
and elevated his public image as a skillful protagonist.</TE>
<TE>   The battle lines were drawn under a moon in Capricorn, Jupiter in
Aries and Uranus in Cancer, meaning things were bound to get intense.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall attacked with the conventional arguments against
astrology, pounding the table for emphasis.</TE>
<TE>   Omarr calmly pointed out that astrology had given birth to
astronomy, that scientists including Isaac Newton believed it should
be studied.</TE>
<TE>   Omarr likes to say that, judging from the letters and telephone
calls that followed, he won the "great debate." At a minimum, it
helped make the stargazer a star.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1970s, Omarr was publishing several books a year, and
appearing regularly on TV talk shows hosted by Virgo Regis Philbin,
Leo Mike Douglas, Cancer Merv Griffin and Libra Johnny Carson.</TE>
<TE>   He also threw legendary parties for fawning celebrities and
glamorous women in his home at that time, a Santa Monica condominium
overlooking the waves.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all of the women in his life remain close friends.</TE>
<TE>   Among them is Virgo Jeraldine Saunders, a former fashion model and
television producer who was Omarr's wife in 1966 for eight months.</TE>
<TE>   "Sydney is a true oracle; he's a mystic, he's psychic, a genius --
and he's very witty," she said. "When we were flying around the world
together he'd say, 'Remember, Jeraldine, if this plane goes down,
tell them I predicted it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Another admirer is actress Libra Angie Dickinson, who first
crossed Omarr's path on a Merv Griffin show.</TE>
<TE>   "The moment we met, we just clicked," Dickinson recalled. "I'd
say, 'Syd, I lost my ring, what do I do?' or 'Syd, I'm having a tough
time with a guy.' He'd say, 'Pick three numbers, fast.' Based on the
numbers I'd choose, he'd give me the right advice."</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, he could see, and we'd look each other in the eye as
we toasted with champagne," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it wasn't easy being Omarr once the symptoms of MS became
impossible to disguise, triggering what he remembers as "little
disappointments."</TE>
<TE>   "At one point during a Merv Griffin show, everyone stood up except
me -- I couldn't," he said. "Some critics thought I was being
disrespectful and asked, 'Who the hell do you think you are?'</TE>
<TE>   "Then there was the time a stranger called and asked for a
personal reading," he said. "I told her I don't do that. She said,
'Well, I just got some real bad news. I've got MS. But I guess you
wouldn't understand.' Then she hung up."</TE>
<TE>   He will do readings for special friends, but generally, "I don't
like to do personal readings," said Omarr, who has made a habit of
returning the blank checks of millionaires wanting their fortune told
by the master.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a big problem with astrologers and some psychologists
who mislead people by taking on the air of being godlike," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he's just too busy to deal with one-on-one readings.
Assembling the daily column alone takes hours each day to complete.</TE>
<TE>   The pithy lines he dictates to Barbeaux are dispatched by express
mail to the Tribune Co., which licenses his column. (The Times, which
carries Omarr's column, is owned by the Tribune Co.)</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge is keeping the results fresh and lively," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Omarr's workload got a little heavier in September, when the
Sydney Omarr slot machine he helped develop was unveiled at a Las
Vegas trade show. Other business proposals riding on Omarr's name
recognition are in the works.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledges that, given his physical challenges, plans are
already in place to continue the column after he's moved on to the
next life.</TE>
<TE>   "Like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the Gemini author of Sherlock
Holmes," he said, "I'm a firm believer that the personality survives
death."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Officials Defend Public Comments in Anthrax Probe</HD>
<DH>The Justice Department says the phrase 'person of interest'
was not meant to cast aspersions on Dr. Steven Hatfill. Senator
remains critical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department defended its use of the term "person of
interest" to describe Dr. Steven Hatfill in the anthrax
investigation, contending the designation never was intended to cast
suspicion upon him. Meantime, FBI agents searched for evidence
Thursday in at least one pond outside Hatfill's former hometown.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), Assistant Atty.
Gen. Daniel J. Bryant said the "person of interest" term originated
with unnamed FBI sources as speculation swirled in the media and on
the Internet that Hatfill might be a suspect.</LD>
<LD>   The phrase, Bryant said, was intended to "deflect media scrutiny
from Dr. Hatfill and explain that he was just one of many scientists"
being questioned by the FBI in the anthrax probe.</LD>
<TE>   The release of the letter came as FBI agents began a search
Thursday on wooded public land near Frederick, Md., several miles
from Hatfill's old apartment. Officials confirmed the search was tied
to the anthrax investigation.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents closed off a 1 1/2-mile section of an icy two-lane road
in the Catoctin Mountains. Two Justice Department officials, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said divers were searching at least one
pond.</TE>
<TE>   An FBI official on the scene said the area would be blocked off
throughout the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the FBI said it was conducting "forensic searches
on public land" and stressed that previous water, soil and sediment
tests had ruled out any anthrax threat to public health or safety.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill, whose former apartment has been searched at least three
times, worked until 1999 for Ft. Detrick's Army Medical Research
Institute of Infectious Diseases in Maryland. It is the primary
custodian of the virulent Ames strain of anthrax found in the anthrax
letters. Hatfill has said he never worked with anthrax.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill has denied any involvement in the anthrax attacks, which
killed five people and infected 18 others when letters containing the
deadly spores were sent to government and news media offices in
Washington, New York and Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill has said the Justice Department's scrutiny has destroyed
his career and left his personal life in turmoil. His friend and
spokesman, Pat Clawson, denounced the latest FBI search.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI can search the planet until hell freezes over but it will
find that Steve Hatfill was never involved in the anthrax attacks,"
Clawson said.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department letter, released by Grassley, acknowledged
there is no formal definition for "person of interest," but said it
is a commonly understood term for "an individual whom law enforcement
officials seek to question in connection with a particular matter."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Grassley said the letter shows use of the term to
describe Hatfill is unprecedented and not supported by any formal
policy or evidentiary standard.</TE>
<TE>   "Government agencies need to be mindful of the power they wield
over individual citizens, and should exercise caution and good
judgment when they use that power," said Grassley, of the Senate
Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Clawson said the letter shows that the department "makes up the
rules as it goes along and is utterly shameless about trampling on
due process and civil rights."</TE>
<TE>   A separate letter to Grassley states the Justice Department had
the authority to demand that Louisiana State University not use
Hatfill on any work related to government contracts. The school fired
Hatfill from its National Center for Biomedical Research and Training
after the Justice Department e-mailed the university to "cease and
desist" using Hatfill as an expert or course instructor.</TE>

<HD>Bush Advances Faith-Based Initiative</HD>
<DH>With Congress out of session, president signs an order
making it easier for religious groups to get federal funds for
charity work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Circumventing Congress, President Bush used his executive powers
Thursday to make it easier for religious groups to obtain federal
funds to perform charitable services.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's action puts into effect key elements of his faith-based
initiative, a cornerstone of his agenda of "compassionate
conservatism" and a proposal he unveiled just days after taking
office.</LD>
<LD>   The initiative was blocked by Congress' failure to agree on the
extent to which religious groups could mix their messages with
charity work while accepting government money.</LD>
<TE>   Under Bush's order, groups that hire workers based on the
individual's religious beliefs will not be barred from receiving
federal money, as they have been in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "When the federal government gives contracts to private groups to
provide social services, religious groups should have an equal chance
to compete," Bush said in a speech to several thousand religious
leaders and other representatives of religious charities. "When
decisions are made on public funding, we should not focus on the
religion you practice; we should focus on the results you deliver."</TE>
<TE>   In a setting that mimicked a bill-signing ceremony, Bush sat at a
small desk behind a sign reading "Compassion in Action" and signed an
executive order that he said would direct federal agencies "to follow
the principle of equal treatment" in awarding social service grants.</TE>
<TE>   Later, back in Washington, he also ordered such agencies as the
Federal Emergency Management Agency and the departments of Housing
and Urban Development and Health and Human Services to remove any
regulations that might block religious nonprofit groups from
qualifying for federal aid.</TE>
<TE>   The measures implement an important part of the president's
initiative, but two important elements need congressional approval:</TE>
<TE>   One would provide tax incentives to spur private charitable
contributions for religious groups that deliver social services. The
other would provide funding to help smaller faith-based groups
compete for federal money to pay for the help they give the needy. A
measure that did not pass Congress last year set a figure of $1.275
billion over two years.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents argue that providing government funds to religious
groups violates the Constitution's separation of church and state.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush is on a crusade to bring about an unprecedented merger of
religion and government," said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive
director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a
Washington-based organization, and a minister in the United Church of
Christ. He said the group would consider challenging the action in
court.</TE>
<TE>   The American Civil Liberties Union predicted that Congress would
continue to object to what the group's legislative counsel,
Christopher Anders, called "taxpayer-funded religious
discrimination."</TE>
<TE>   To illustrate its objection to the plan, the ACLU noted that a
Jewish psychotherapist, Alan Yorker, had sought work at the United
Methodist Children's Home in Decatur, Ga., which found him to be the
most qualified applicant but denied him the job because of his
religion.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech here, Bush offered his own examples of the sort of
charitable work that had been blocked by concern that it crossed the
constitutional barrier:</TE>
<TE>   The Victory Center Rescue Mission in Iowa had been told to return
a government grant because its board of directors "was not secular
enough," he said. And the St. Francis House Homeless Shelter in South
Dakota lost a grant "because voluntary prayers were offered before
meals," he added.</TE>
<TE>   "I recognize that government has no business endorsing a religious
creed, or directly funding religious worship or religious teaching,"
the president said.</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, "Government can and should support social services
provided by religious people, as long as those services go to anyone
in need, regardless of their faith.</TE>
<TE>   "And when government gives that support, charities and faith-based
programs should not be forced to change their character or compromise
their mission."</TE>
<TE>   The trip to Philadelphia offered Bush an opportunity to shift the
White House spotlight from Iraq and the economy to a program at the
heart of his social agenda -- one favored by some of his most loyal,
energetic and conservative supporters.</TE>
<TE>   At its center is the use of nongovernmental groups to help meet
the demands for social services -- work that the charities have
traditionally performed and that relieves pressure on the government.</TE>
<TE>   Under the 1996 revision of the federal welfare law, for example,
religious groups compete for federal funds to carry out foster care
programs or to help welfare recipients receive job training. Or they
might accept federal aid for drug abuse, alcoholism or housing
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Such charities, Bush said, deserve the support of foundations,
corporations, individual donors and religious groups and, "when
appropriate, the support of the federal government."</TE>
<TE>   He is likely to make the faith-based initiative a key part of his
proposals to Congress next year, hoping that legislators will pick up
quickly from where the previous Congress left off, although new votes
will be required in each chamber.</TE>
<TE>   In the last session, the House passed a measure that would allow
religious groups to provide social services typically offered by
government agencies -- receiving federal money for the work without
having to muffle their religious missions. The president's executive
orders are close to the provisions of the House measure.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate never completed work on a bill placing greater
restrictions on religious teaching and the groups' use of religion to
discriminate in hiring for their charitable work if they receive
federal financial assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), who was trying to work out a
compromise, called Bush's action Thursday "a constructive step" and
said it appeared to be "a sound plan for realizing the principle of
equal treatment for faith-based groups."</TE>

<HD>Curtain Falls on Chicago's Cook Hospital</HD>
<DH>State-of-the-art at its 1914 opening, it was woefully
antiquated. It was home to TV's 'ER.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Slater</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Perhaps the most famous hospital in the nation, Cook County Hospital
opened the country's first blood bank and the first trauma center,
and pioneered the use of penicillin and trained thousands of doctors.</LD>
<LD>   More than anything else, Cook became a microcosm of urban areas,
as tens of thousands of mostly poor, mostly minority patients -- many
of them victims of violence -- were treated in a hospital with no
air-conditioning and pre-Depression equipment.</LD>
<LD>   The longest continuously operating hospital in the country closed
its old doors Thursday after 88 years. The 430 patients were wheeled
out of their drab, dark, prison-like wards through tunnels and into a
$551-million facility with such novelties as in-room bathrooms and
phones.</LD>
<TE>   After 27 years as a trauma surgeon at Cook, Dr. John Barrett was
delighted, nostalgic and philosophical about the move.</TE>
<TE>   "I came from Ireland in 1975 because I wanted to work on gunshot
wounds, and this was the place to do it," said Barrett, head of the
trauma department. "The new hospital is wonderful, but it won't stop
the violence that brings many people here in the first place."</TE>
<TE>   The move to the John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County, named
for the head of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, follows more
than a decade of work to close Cook, or "County," as the facility on
the West Side is known.</TE>
<TE>   Cook, the setting for the hit television series "ER," was built in
1914 and was at the time a state-of-the art facility, with its
lighted nurse call-boards and relative privacy -- four to a room,
generally, except in less life-threatening cases, when patients were
bedded in rooms of 10 or more.</TE>
<TE>   The producers of "ER" chose Cook as the location for the series
because it offered a tough, dramatic, recognizable backdrop for
scenes of life and death and the reality faced by young emergency
room doctors. The truth of Cook, however, could not be broadcast on
network television.</TE>
<TE>   Cook got about 3,500 "intentional violence" cases a year: victims
of beatings, stabbings and gunshot wounds. Many of those people were
dropped at the emergency room entrance by friends who did not want to
be associated with the crime that had prompted the trip to the
hospital, just a few miles from downtown's Loop business district.</TE>
<TE>   Of those cases, from 600 to 1,000 each year involved gunshot
wounds. When Barrett began his training, the vast majority of gunshot
victims had a single wound delivered by a relatively low-velocity
round, many from .38-caliber six-shot revolvers of the type police
officers used through the 1970s and 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   As the technology improved in the trauma ward, so it did on the
streets. Many of the gunshot victims today have multiple wounds, from
guns that hold not six but 10 or 15 rounds, bullets that travel at a
much greater velocity and therefore carry more kinetic energy than
with older guns. Kinetic energy is what kills most victims, as the
trail of damage extends outward from the bullet to affect tissues and
organs not directly hit.</TE>
<TE>   All patients -- most of whom had no insurance, some with modest
Medicare or Medicaid benefits -- found themselves in surroundings
that today seem from another era entirely.</TE>
<TE>   When it was humid outside, as it often is during Chicago summers,
nurses covered the windows with blankets to keep out the sunlight and
placed fans 4 feet in diameter throughout the hallways, because there
was no air-conditioning.</TE>
<TE>   The rooms had no phones. Patients, regardless of their conditions,
had to trundle to the end of each ward to a bank of pay phones.
Televisions had to be brought from home.</TE>
<TE>   Patients needing assistance pressed a call button that set off a
light at the nurses' station. A nurse had to watch the board
constantly. The watch nurse summoned help by announcing it through a
loudspeaker that echoed throughout the ward, day and night. There was
little buffer against the noise because rooms were metal cubicles
with walls that did not meet the ceilings, providing very little
privacy.</TE>
<TE>   Each ward, which held more than 30 patients, had one restroom for
men, one for women, and a single bath.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Smith, 39, was the last trauma patient admitted before Cook
stopped accepting patients Wednesday night, and the first to be
transferred to the new facility.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in an altercation," Smith said groggily as he recovered
from unconsciousness and a sutured eyebrow. "They got the best of
me."</TE>
<TE>   Smith had been to Cook before, he said. The transition was
something to behold.</TE>
<TE>   "This," he said, "is a hospital."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the new facility is air-conditioned, has views of the city
rather than of cinderblock walls, and incorporates the latest
technology.</TE>
<TE>   If a patient required oxygen in the old hospital, nurses stuffed a
big, green oxygen cylinder into the cramped quarters. Oxygen and
other medical gases now flow through a system in the walls.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors will write most of their notes not on paper but on COWs,
computers on wheels. Instead of film, the hospital will record CT
scans, X-rays and MRIs digitally, meaning they can be accessed
through the hospital and sent to outside clinics at the touch of a
button.</TE>
<TE>   Such technology has become standard at many hospitals nationwide.
Here, it feels like a leap into the future.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of people lined up Thursday, waiting for hours to have
their prescriptions filled. When the new pharmacy is up and going,
two robots will help deliver the medication.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if she'd miss the old hospital, Ruth Rothstein, the head of
the Cook County Bureau of Health Services, which runs the new
facility, said: "Not for half a second. When I came in 12 years ago,
it was the most dysfunctional building I'd ever seen. You can't treat
people in the Dark Ages when there's sunshine outside."</TE>
<TE>   Barrett, the trauma unit chief, is retiring this month. He'll miss
the kind of camaraderie built when he and his team saved the life of
a gas-station robber hit by 37 police bullets.</TE>
<TE>   He plans to hike the Appalachian Trail, maybe teach, and hope for
the day when trauma workers spend more time on people hurt in
accidents rather than during altercations in poor neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "The true answer to trauma in the inner city is not bigger and
better trauma centers," Barrett said.</TE>
<TE>   "The solution is prevention. We're pulling people out of the river
when we ought to be fixing the broken bridge that sent them in."</TE>

<HD>Bush Adds Economic Advisor to New Team</HD>
<DH>Ex-Goldman Sachs head Friedman gets key position despite
some conservative opposition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter G. Gosselin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush brushed aside the objections of supply-side
conservatives Thursday and named former Goldman Sachs Chairman
Stephen Friedman as his chief economic policy advisor, completing a
sweep of the administration's economic team just weeks before what
could be a contentious debate over how to help the nation's sluggish
economy.</LD>
<LD>   Friedman, 64, will be director of the White House's National
Economic Council. He succeeds economist Lawrence B. Lindsey, who was
dismissed last week along with Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill for
failing to effectively represent the administration on economic
matters.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Bush tapped rail giant CSX Corp. Chief Executive John
W. Snow to be his next Treasury secretary, and the next day picked
former New York Stock Exchange Chairman William H. Donaldson to
succeed Harvey L. Pitt as chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</LD>
<TE>   "He's an innovative economic thinker, a proven manager and a
business leader of national standing," the president said Thursday of
Friedman. "Steve Friedman will be a key member of our team."</TE>
<TE>   In the days since their names first surfaced, Friedman, and to a
lesser extent Snow, have been the targets of conservative attacks for
their work in the mid-1990s advocating deficit reduction and balanced
budgets. Supply-siders ridicule such goals as neither politically
palatable nor particularly effective, and argue instead for steep new
tax cuts to spur growth. Friedman was a director of the bipartisan
anti-deficit group the Concord Coalition as well as a director of the
nonpartisan Brookings Institution.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks helped stall Friedman's appointment, although Bush
aides insisted the chief reason for the delay was the complexity of
the investment banker's personal finances, which the White House had
to review before naming him to the post.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative activists said Thursday they had received assurances
from senior White House aides that Friedman will not use his new
position to pursue what one termed "the failed politics of the
Concord Coalition."</TE>
<TE>   "I've been told the guy is on board with the president's program
and will cheerfully go out and sell pro-growth tax cuts," said Grover
Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative
lobbying group.</TE>
<TE>   But some doubt that Friedman can successfully mediate between the
tax cut and deficit hawk wings of the Republican Party, which have
been at odds for more than two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see how he can keep both camps happy," said Brookings
economist William C. Gale.</TE>
<TE>   With his economic team now largely replaced -- the only prominent
survivor of the shake-up is Council of Economic Advisors Chairman R.
Glenn Hubbard -- the president turns to the next order of business,
getting the economy to grow strongly again.</TE>
<TE>   The White House appears to have settled on a new, 10-year
$300-billion package of tax cuts that includes additional breaks for
savers, a reduction in the so-called double taxation of dividends and
an expansion of companies' right to "expense" investment -- that is,
use the amounts they spend on new plants and equipment to shrink
their tax bills.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the president wants to make the $1.35 trillion in tax
cuts for which he won congressional approval last year permanent. As
things now stand, they will expire after 2010.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that economists are deeply divided about whether
the economy needs the extra help and policymakers are at odds over
whether Washington can afford the new cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday provided a classic example of the kind of mixed signals
that the economy is sending.</TE>
<TE>   In short order, the public learned that: November retail sales,
which had been thought to be weak, were stronger than expected;
initial unemployment benefit claims, which had been going down, took
a huge jump up, and Federal Reserve policy-makers, who hinted after
meeting this week that they thought the economy was on the mend,
released documents disclosing that they devoted much of their
previous meeting worrying about deflation.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the economy does need help, Washington decision-makers are
deeply divided over what kind and how much.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats favor temporary measures that would generally focus on
working- and middle- class households, such as a six-month payroll
tax holiday or short-term grants to help state governments out of
their budget binds. The president and Republican congressional
leaders want permanent cuts focused on business and investors.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman will be responsible for mediating the debate at a time
when the government has swung from running surpluses to posting
deficits. The deficit for the fiscal year that ended in September was
$158.5 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman is now a senior principal with Marsh &amp; McLennan Capital
Inc. as well as a director of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Fannie Mae and
Goldman Sachs.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, he was co-chairman of Goldman Sachs with
former Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, to whom he is
often likened. When Rubin came to Washington, Friedman headed the
huge investment banking firm on his own and was credited with pushing
it into a variety of new businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman graduated from Cornell University in 1959 and from
Columbia University law school in 1962.</TE>

<HD>Georgia Fails Its Poor Defendants, Report Says</HD>
<DH>State commission finds the indigent get representation that
is inadequate and urges major changes in the system of justice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Georgia is failing to meet its constitutional duty to protect the
rights of poor people accused of crimes and must radically overhaul
its system of indigent defense, a blue ribbon commission appointed by
the state Supreme Court said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The commission found the state's fragmented system, which lacks
quality control standards for lawyers representing the poor, enhances
the possibility that innocent defendants wind up in jail and that
some of the guilty stay in jail longer than they should. Indigents
are supposed to see a lawyer within 72 hours of arrest but often wait
weeks and sometimes months for an initial meeting with an attorney,
it found.</LD>
<LD>   Georgia's indigent defense system "results in an inadequate, and
in many respects, unconstitutional level of services, tremendous
variation in quality and serious unfairness in the operation of the
criminal justice system," the 26-member commission said after
completing a two-year study.</LD>
<TE>   About 80% of the defendants in Georgia are indigent, "so in a lot
of ways the indigent defense system is the criminal justice system,"
said commission Chairman Charles R. Morgan, vice president and
general counsel of BellSouth Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The commission -- which included judges, legislators, prosecutors,
private attorneys and county officials -- recommended dramatically
increased funding, but said money alone would not solve the problem.</TE>
<TE>   The delivery of indigent defense services must be "reorganized to
ensure accountability, uniformity of quality, enforceability of
standards and constitutionally adequate representation," said the
report, which was presented by Morgan and Paul Kurtz, associate dean
at University of Georgia Law School, to the seven justices of the
Georgia Supreme Court, who listened attentively in their courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   The system should be run by a statewide board charged with the
responsibility and power to hire and fire full-time defenders for
each of the state's 49 judicial circuits, define guidelines for the
system and conduct training programs for attorneys involved in
indigent defense, the commission recommended.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia's Chief Justice Norman S. Fletcher hailed the release of
the report "as a great day for justice in Georgia."</TE>
<TE>   He said if the report's recommendations are implemented, it would
be a significant step toward providing "equal justice" in the state,
where 170,000 criminal defendants qualified for a publicly funded
lawyer last year.</TE>
<TE>   Only 20 of Georgia's 159 counties have full-time public defenders,
while the remaining counties use attorneys picked by judges from a
panel of attorneys who sign a contract to handle indigent cases for a
fixed fee. Those contracts have been heavily criticized; some believe
they create a disincentive to do little more than the minimal amount
of work on each case.</TE>
<TE>   The commission noted that a recent Georgia Court of Appeals
decision "not only reversed a criminal conviction for ineffective
assistance of counsel, but also provided a window into the actual
operation of indigent defense" in the state.</TE>
<TE>   That case involved a contract lawyer who had represented 300
indigents but had never taken a case to a jury. Rather, the lawyer
encouraged them to plead guilty.</TE>
<TE>   In the case at issue, the attorney's client pleaded guilty to
injuring someone while driving drunk and received a 15-year sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney interviewed no witnesses and did not once confer with
his client during the 13 months between arraignment and the entry of
the plea.</TE>
<TE>   Lawton Stephens, one of the judges on the commission, said his
views on indigent defense had been dramatically affected by the
testimony earlier this year of Mark Straughn, a contract lawyer from
rural Dodge County. Straughn, who received about $50 a case, said he
believed it was a "grave error for a defense attorney to assume" his
clients were innocent. Soon thereafter, his contract was taken away
from him.</TE>
<TE>   The report noted that two class-action suits, one in a rural
county and one in Atlanta, already have led to some piecemeal reforms
and that more lawsuits are anticipated. But the commission
recommended "thorough, carefully considered reform of the Georgia
system" by the state Legislature and executive branch as "far
preferable to reform by litigation."</TE>
<TE>   Currently, Georgia counties fund the lion's share of the state's
$50.6-million annual expenditure on indigent defense, with the state
picking up only 11%.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's recommendations come at a time when Georgia is in
the midst of a budget shortfall and newly elected Republican Gov.
Sonny Perdue has called for further belt-tightening.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, commission member Charles C. Clay, an influential
Republican attorney, said he thought there was a "good chance" that
the commission's structural reforms could be put in place next year.
There is "a moral imperative" on this issue, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Clay, who is expected to be chairman of the state Senate judiciary
committee next year, said it would take longer, perhaps a few years,
to change the funding mechanism so the state would assume primary
responsibility, which he said the state was constitutionally
obligated to do.</TE>
<TE>   The report received praise from Stephen B. Bright, director of the
Southern Center for Human Rights, which has filed five major lawsuits
in recent years contending that various Georgia counties had failed
to provide proper representation for poor defendants.</TE>
<TE>   "The commission has acknowledged the undeniable -- the Georgia
system is unconstitutional -- and has provided a blueprint to fix
it," Bright said. "I agree that a comprehensive legislative solution
to this problem is preferable to piecemeal change by litigation. But
if the Legislature doesn't act, we'll continue to file lawsuits until
we bring each county into compliance with the Constitution."</TE>

<HD>Israel Cites Success in Vaccination Effort</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilkinson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>It may still be a matter of debate in the United States, but Israel
has already vaccinated 15,000 health workers, police officers and
army medics against smallpox with virtually no adverse side effects,
Israeli government officials say.</LD>
<LD>   The inoculation campaign began in earnest in September amid fear
of a bioterrorism attack from Iraq. The Israeli Health Ministry
identified and vaccinated a carefully screened group of "first
responders" and will now advise the government on whether to broaden
the program's reach.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout the campaign, only four people developed symptoms that
warranted hospitalization, Health Ministry spokesman Ido Hadari said
Thursday. And two of those -- a woman and a baby boy -- hadn't been
vaccinated but had touched the places on the arms of relatives where
the medicine had been applied.</LD>
<TE>   All four recovered and returned home, Hadari said. He attributed
the lack of serious side effects to strict vetting and elimination of
those who should not be immunized, including anyone with an immune
disorder or eczema, or who was pregnant or had received a transplant.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a great success for public health," Hadari said. "We
were very, very cautious. I don't want to use the word 'frightened,'
but we did try to frighten those who were being vaccinated into
taking a good look at the contraindications."</TE>
<TE>   Health Ministry officials announced over the summer that they
could inoculate all 6.5 million Israeli citizens in a matter of days
if smallpox cases were detected here or anywhere in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   But the government says it is not presently planning to widen the
program to the general public. The perceived threat is not great
enough to outweigh the potential health troubles, said Raanan Gissin,
spokesman for Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, there is no need," Gissin said. "There are more risks
when you vaccinate a whole population instead of a controlled group.
Given the intelligence we have and the assessment of the threat at
this time, it is not worth an anticipatory vaccination. "</TE>
<TE>   Israel stopped immunizing its children against smallpox in 1978
but continued to vaccinate soldiers until 1996 -- when the children
born in 1978 entered military service. After 1996, each new crop of
soldiers had not received vaccinations as children, so health
officials determined they should not as adults.</TE>
<TE>   As encouraging as Israel's experience with smallpox vaccinations
may be, some U.S. experts say it is too small an exercise to draw
conclusions about what might happen in the United States, where the
Bush administration is planning to inoculate 1 million people.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Israel reproduces its vaccine by injecting it into chicken
eggs, while the United States uses a strain that is thought to be
more virulent.</TE>
<TE>   Hadari said U.S. officials have been in regular contact with
Israeli officials to compare notes. The two groups have consulted on
the latest testing in U.S. laboratories, Israel's public education
programs and how to allay fears about the inoculations.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis immunized so far include hospital workers, emergency
crews, police and army medics, Hadari said. Rank-and-file soldiers
have not been treated, but Guy Rubin, medical division director for
the Defense Ministry said that troops will be inoculated against
smallpox, and that vaccinations will be available to reservists.</TE>

<HD>Expectation Grows That Cardinal Will Resign</HD>
<DH>Speculation intensifies in Boston while Law meets with the
pope. A grand jury looks into possible criminal acts in sex-abuse
scandal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Mehren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>With Cardinal Bernard Law scheduled to meet today in Rome with Pope
John Paul II, speculation mounted here Thursday that the beleaguered
archbishop will soon resign.</LD>
<LD>   Law's unscheduled, weeklong Vatican visit also was clouded by the
disclosure of a pending grand jury inquiry into possible criminal
violations by the cardinal and other church leaders in connection
with the sexual abuse scandal gripping the Boston Archdiocese.</LD>
<LD>   As Law met Thursday with Vatican bishops and staff, it remained
unclear whether he will seek and obtain permission for the
archdiocese to declare bankruptcy -- a move that would complicate
hundreds of sexual abuse complaints lodged against the Boston church.</LD>
<TE>   The gravity of the situation, said historian Scott Appleby of
Notre Dame University, "far exceeds anything we have ever seen in the
American [Roman] Catholic Church. The depth and seriousness of this
scandal is unprecedented. We can hype, hype, hype all the time. This
is a case in which you are not hyping."</TE>
<TE>   No American cardinal ever has resigned "as a result of his actions
or inactions dealing with abuse by priests," said Father Thomas
Reese, editor of America magazine in New York. In fact, Reese said,
no cardinal in this country has left office except for reasons of
health or age.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Reese said, no diocese in the United States ever has
filed for bankruptcy, although that strategy was discussed in Tucson
and Dallas when sex abuse scandals erupted there.</TE>
<TE>   Under such mounting pressure, Reese said, it would be unsurprising
if Law left office.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, what they could do is announce not that he has
resigned, but that the pope has appointed him to be in charge of the
Vatican coin collection and so he must move to Rome," Reese said.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal made a similar abrupt trip to Rome in April, after a
series of disclosures contained in previously confidential church
files embarrassed the archdiocese. Rather than step down, he returned
to Boston determined to tough out the crisis and mend the damage to
the archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   But a flood of documents made public in the last 10 days gave new
momentum to a church emergency that already was unraveling at a
breakneck pace.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Massachusetts Atty. Gen. Thomas Reilly on
Thursday confirmed a Boston Globe report that state troopers
delivered a subpoena Dec. 6 to the cardinal's mansion.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Donlan, Reilly's spokeswoman, said that "he has authorized the
grand jury as a legal tool" to investigate the archdiocese. Seven
bishops who worked with Law also received subpoenas in the
investigation. No criminal charges have been filed.</TE>
<TE>   J. Owen Todd, the cardinal's lawyer, told Associated Press that he
does not believe the cardinal is a target but simply a witness called
to testify.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they'll find that what has taken place and has been
disclosed and discussed at great length in the civil depositions does
not constitute any crime in Massachusetts," Todd said.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese spokeswoman Donna M. Morrissey did not return calls
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   But Jim Post, president of Voice of the Faithful, said Thursday
that the Boston-based Catholic reform organization came sadly and
reluctantly to its decision late the night before to call for Law's
resignation. Post said the vote followed a Nov. 26 meeting with Law
at his chancery in which Law assured group leaders that only two
cases of sexual abuse allegations had been received since tough new
archdiocese guidelines on the problem took effect in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   When thousands of pages of once-confidential documents were
released one week later, "it was clear that that was not true," Post
said. "There were inconsistencies that were very troubling to us.</TE>
<TE>   "What we saw was this pervasive pattern of administrative
concealment and cover-up. And that ran almost up to the present time.
It was clear that there was just this huge disconnect, to put it
mildly."</TE>
<TE>   After months of vowing to work with church leadership, the group's
leadership council voted 71 to 2 to seek Law's resignation. (The
250-member Boston Priests' Forum was expected to meet today to
discuss asking Law to resign.)</TE>
<TE>   Yet another round of church files released early this week "seems
to suggest that even the Vatican was involved," said Post, a
professor of management at Boston University.</TE>
<TE>   "The release of the documents -- as incomplete as they are --
points a finger toward a systemic policy of concealing and covering
up these practices that have hurt so many innocent people. It's boys,
it's girls, it's women, it's men, it's nuns and nuns in training,
it's seminarians -- it's across the population," Post said.</TE>
<TE>   So damaging were the contents of the files released in connection
with a series of civil lawsuits that Reese, a member of the Jesuits,
likened their impact to the publication of the Pentagon Papers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's this paper trail that has made Boston so unique," Reese
said. "All these documents show what the leaders knew and when they
knew it."</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, the onus has fallen hardest of all on Law. For
nearly 20 years, Law has presided over more than 2 million Catholics
in a region that is more than 50% Catholic.</TE>
<TE>   Law established himself as a Vatican loyalist.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he was always "aloof, and a deeply political person," said
Boston College theology professor Stephen Pope. "He was never warmly
beloved, never anybody you would want to sit down and have dinner
with."</TE>
<TE>   The sexual abuse crisis -- and in particular, its most recent,
devastating installment -- has shattered the cardinal's authority,
Pope said.</TE>
<TE>   "Law's leadership is in the past tense, and it is impossible for
him to recover that," Pope said.</TE>
<TE>   "The pope has to decide: Does he want someone who is a figurehead,
or does he want someone who can actually be a leader?"</TE>

<HD>Lott Remarks Earn Presidential Rebuke</HD>
<DH>'Any suggestion that a segregated past was acceptable or
positive is offensive,' Bush says. Senator's office offers yet
another apology.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Simon and Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Thursday publicly scolded incoming Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) for "offensive" remarks that seemed to
endorse segregation, an unusual presidential rebuke of a fellow
Republican that kept alive questions of whether Lott could lose his
leadership post.</LD>
<LD>   "Any suggestion that a segregated past was acceptable or positive
is offensive and it is wrong," Bush said to loud and long applause in
a speech to a racially mixed audience of religious-based charities in
Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   Lott's office responded with a short statement apologizing -- for
the third time in less than a week -- for his recent remarks praising
the 1948 presidential campaign of Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) that
promoted segregation: "Sen. Lott agrees with President Bush that his
words were wrong, and he is sorry. He repudiates segregation because
it is immoral."</LD>
<TE>   White House officials clearly are concerned that Lott's remarks
will hinder Bush's long-standing effort to build minority support for
the GOP -- a goal especially important as the White House gears up
for the 2004 presidential election. The president also has been
counting on Lott to play a key role in pushing the administration's
agenda through the narrowly divided GOP-led Senate next year.</TE>
<TE>   Bush did not call for Lott to step down as Senate Republican
leader, nor have any of the Mississippian's GOP colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bush's comments "are a remarkably strong admonishment
coming from a president to the leader of his party in the Senate,"
said Don Kettl, a University of Wisconsin political scientist.</TE>
<TE>   And Sen. Charles Hagel (R-Neb.) broached the prospect that Lott's
job is in jeopardy. "Is this a big enough deal to cause a revolution
in the Republican conference? I don't think so, but these things have
a way of going further than you expect."</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly this week, Lott has been subjected to the
drip-drip-drip of criticism and scrutiny that often drives officials
from power in Washington. Even before Bush's comments, influential
Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) suggested Thursday that the GOP leader
do more to defuse the controversy, perhaps appearing at a news
conference or other forum "in which he just makes clear he was
wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Lugar also had harsh words about Thurmond's presidential
candidacy, saying, "The country would not be better off if Sen.
Thurmond had been elected.... Demonstrably, we would have been much
worse off. In fact, it's unthinkable."</TE>
<TE>   A senior administration official said Bush's remarks about the
furor "came from the president's heart" and were "reflective of his
history as a Republican who believes that inclusion is a central
tenet of our nation."</TE>
<TE>   The official said Bush, in deciding to speak out, recalled a 1995
speech he made as Texas governor assailing immigrant-bashing for
political gain.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, he was referring to California Republican Gov. Pete
Wilson's 1994 support for Proposition 187, the measure that sought to
deny benefits to illegal immigrants. The initiative galvanized a
backlash against Republicans within the Latino community, and many
analysts view it as a key reason for the GOP's continuing political
problems in the state. Bush said Lott's remarks "do not reflect the
spirit of our country."</TE>
<TE>   "He has apologized, and rightly so," Bush said. "The founding
ideals of our nation and, in fact, the founding ideals of the
political party I represent was, and remains today, the equal dignity
and equal rights of every American."</TE>
<TE>   White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr. called Lott before
Bush's speech, and Lott said he agreed with the president's comments.
A Lott aide said the president and Lott spoke by phone after the
speech; the aide characterized the exchange as "positive."</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus, whose 38 members are
all Democratic House members, on Thursday called for Lott's censure.
And the group said Bush's refusal to seek Lott's resignation as
Republican leader "underscores the insincerity of the Republican
Party's attempt to court African Americans and other people of
color."</TE>
<TE>   Lott's hometown paper, the Mississippi Press in Pascagoula,
recommended he resign his leadership post.</TE>
<TE>   And Lott's record on race continued to fuel the controversy. Time
magazine reported that Lott, as a student at the University of
Mississippi in the early 1960s, led efforts to keep blacks out of his
fraternity.</TE>
<TE>   A Lott aide, who requested anonymity, said of the story: "It was
40 years ago, when our country was in a different era."</TE>
<TE>   The aide said Lott also worked to keep his fraternity out of the
race riots that erupted on campus when James Meredith became the
first black enrolled at the school.</TE>
<TE>   Other reports in recent days have noted that in 1982 Lott opposed
an extension of the Voting Rights Act, and that in 1983 he voted
against legislation creating a federal holiday honoring Martin Luther
King Jr.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Senate GOP aide said Lott is trying to weather the
political storm, hoping it will calm during the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   "If it doesn't die down, I think the [Senate Republican] caucus
will be forced give a vote of confidence or no confidence in him,"
the aide said.</TE>
<TE>   Lott left Washington early this week; his office has declined to
reveal his whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   Officials also pressed the effort to distance the White House from
Lott's comments.</TE>
<TE>   Without mentioning Lott by name, White House political director
Ken Mehlman said Bush has often commented that no political party can
be "a great national party that is not winning a greater percentage"
of the minority vote.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic presidential candidates routinely have won 80% to 90%
of the black vote for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Mehlman, speaking at a political conference in Washington, said
the best strategy for the GOP to improve its support among blacks "is
to produce results" in education reform and other social programs.</TE>
<TE>   Lott, 61, has led Senate Republicans as majority leader or
minority leader since Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas stepped down in 1996 to
run for president. He remained in charge of the Senate GOP even after
Sen. James M. Jeffords of Vermont last year quit the GOP and became
an independent, handing control of the Senate to Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Lott was riding high after November's elections returned control
of the Senate to the Republicans and his GOP colleagues again
selected him as majority leader.</TE>
<TE>   But his political life took a dramatic turn last week when, at
Thurmond's 100th birthday party, Lott noted that Mississippi backed
Thurmond's segregationist Dixiecrat presidential candidacy in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   "We're proud of it," Lott said at the gathering. "And if the rest
of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these
problems over all these years, either."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Mayor John Street, a Democrat who attended Bush's
speech, refrained from saying whether Lott should resign his
leadership job.</TE>
<TE>   But he said Lott's remarks "are more than just regrettable.... I'm
not sure a simple apology is good enough. It's inappropriate for
something like this to come from someone in a leadership position."</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Mayor Plans $10-Billion Renewal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John J. Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Thursday announced an ambitious
$10.6-billion redevelopment plan of new neighborhoods, rail links to
airports and a tax-free zone to attract businesses in Lower Manhattan
-- the neighborhood where the World Trade Center once stood.</LD>
<LD>   The area would be transformed by parks, a promenade lined with 700
trees in the style of the Champs Elysees and schools and cultural
institutions.</LD>
<LD>   The mayor's proposal came a week before the Lower Manhattan
Development Corp. is expected to present seven competing proposals
for the future of the trade center site itself.</LD>
<TE>   "But no matter how magnificent the best design for the 16 acres of
the World Trade Center site proves to be," Bloomberg said, "it must
be complemented by an equally bold vision for all of Lower
Manhattan."</TE>
<TE>   Appearing before a gathering of business leaders, he added:</TE>
<TE>   "We must reinvent Lower Manhattan.... If you study New York
history, you realize that it is often at the moments when New York
has faced its greatest challenges that we've had our greatest
achievements."</TE>
<TE>   Reaction to the mayor's proposal from local politicians and
community groups generally was favorable.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Gerson, chairman of the City Council's Select Committee on
the Redevelopment of Lower Manhattan, called the plan "an excellent
partial vision" but warned, "the devil is in the details."</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest details is finding financing when the city
faces its most serious budget gaps in decades, a fact Bloomberg noted
in his speech to a meeting of the Assn. for a Better New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Some will just feel scared, which is natural, and they might ask
how we can afford to do this at this point in the city's history,"
the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg offered a menu of financing mechanisms, including $5.9
billion in federal funds already received for rebuilding the twin
towers site.</TE>
<TE>   Other sources of revenue could be sales of tax-free Liberty Bonds
to stimulate commercial construction, and a tax plan his
administration has proposed to the federal government designed to
lure foreign companies to move their headquarters to Lower Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey could
provide funds, and the sale of real estate development rights over
some transit facilities could help defray costs.</TE>
<TE>   "We have cataloged the costs of every one of these improvements
down to the last tree where possible," Bloomberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have underinvested in Lower Manhattan for decades," the mayor
added. "It's been 70 years since we built a new transit line
downtown."</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg called for a commuter train station at the trade center
site in addition to new subway and ferry facilities. He said a public
market would transform shopping and help anchor housing in two new
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said large-scale performing arts centers would draw
tourists, stimulate private investments and help redefine Lower
Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   "In a city that never sleeps, much of Lower Manhattan goes to bed
promptly at 6 o'clock," Bloomberg said.</TE>
<TE>   He said when the trade center was first built, it was heralded as
a cure-all for Lower Manhattan. But its impact on the city "was not
all positive."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said the center's "voracious appetite for tenants"
weakened the entire downtown real estate market, and the shopping
mall beneath the twin towers complex detracted from commerce on the
streets.</TE>

<HD>Officials Up to the Task of a Vaccine Campaign?</HD>
<DH>With swine flu, anthrax episodes behind them, public health
chiefs toil to get it right. Toughest job will be to inform without
raising alarm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vicki Kemper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The government's last mass vaccination campaign against an infectious
disease, the swine flu in 1976, was a disaster. And the last time the
government tried to inform and reassure the public about a
bioterrorism threat -- anthrax -- its record was mixed, at best.</LD>
<LD>   So on Thursday, the eve of President Bush's announcement that the
smallpox vaccine soon will be made available to all Americans, the
government's top public health officials were holed up, working to
ensure they get it right this time.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, administration officials have been working ever since
Sept. 11, 2001, to prepare the nation for a bioterrorism attack,
something they have repeatedly characterized as all but inevitable.</LD>
<TE>   The government has bought and stockpiled supplies of the vaccine,
improved public health communication systems and begun training
health-care workers -- all while debating a mass vaccination policy.</TE>
<TE>   States and a few cities, including Los Angeles, have filed
emergency vaccination plans and identified the hospitals, clinics and
number of health-care workers who would participate.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes the hard part: Not only explaining to the American
people why a potentially risky vaccine is being made available, but
doing so without alarming them that they cannot make an informed
decision about whether to be vaccinated.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the challenges are clear.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people may still have questions about why we're talking
about all this," said David Ropeik, director of risk communications
at the Harvard School of Public Health. "It's expectable that people
would have an 'Oh, my God, why are we doing this?' reaction."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, director of the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, understands the importance of getting
out a clear message.</TE>
<TE>   "The highest priority initially is to communicate the plan," she
said Thursday, adding that the CDC has been developing a public
education campaign, targeting key audiences, getting training in risk
communications and putting "tons of information" on its Web site
(http://www.bt.cdc. gov/agent/smallpox/index.asp).</TE>
<TE>   "People are hungry for information that will give them a sense of
security," Ropeik said. But to properly convey that, he added, the
Bush administration will have to act a little bit less like the
government. "I think the real challenge in doing this well is giving
up a little bit of control" and simply giving people the information
they need to make their own decisions, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A new public opinion poll commissioned by the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation supports Ropeik's view that the communication challenges
facing the administration are considerable.</TE>
<TE>   Conducted in late October, the poll found that while almost 60% of
Americans are worried about a possible smallpox attack,
three-quarters believe the country is only "somewhat prepared" or
"not too prepared" for a biological or chemical attack.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the poll indicated a strong preference for medical
professionals as the messengers of information on how to prepare for
and protect against a bioterrorist attack. While half of those
surveyed said they most trusted their personal physician to correctly
convey such information, only 24% expressed confidence in the
secretary of Health and Human Services, and just 19% preferred to
hear from the secretary of the new Homeland Security Department.</TE>
<TE>   The head of the CDC and local and state health officials also
ranked high on the trust scale, while the media ranked last,
garnering the trust of only 13% of those surveyed.</TE>
<TE>   Public health officials said they were troubled by indications
that Americans would primarily rely on their family doctors during a
smallpox outbreak.</TE>
<TE>   "Protecting a community from smallpox cannot be handled on a
person-by-person, case-by-case basis," said Patrick Lenihan, deputy
commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health and president
of the National Assn. of County and City Health Officials. "It
requires a system."</TE>
<TE>   The results offered a mirror image of the administration's
management of last year's anthrax crisis. The head of the CDC and the
surgeon general, both of whom have since left office, were largely
kept out of the loop, while HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson and
Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge struggled to communicate rapidly
changing information.</TE>
<TE>   The poll's findings raised questions about the administration's
smallpox communication strategy, which until now has focused on
educating reporters.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has to be involved in explaining the smallpox
vaccination policy, Ropeik said, because "people look to him in a
kind of parental way."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, he said, the administration should enlist the
nation's major doctors organizations, as well as state and local
public health officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone agrees this is a deadly vaccine we're dealing with,"
said Andrew L. Stern, president of Service Employees International
Union, which includes 755,000 health-care workers. "This is not your
normal childhood vaccine here. Yet [the administration] hasn't done
nearly enough to protect the health" of the nurses, doctors and
others who would respond to a smallpox attack, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Stern met this week with Jerome M. Hauer, head of the HHS Office
of Public Health Emergency Preparedness, to discuss his union's
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   While the vaccination of health-care workers is voluntary, for
example, many emergency room workers report they have been pressured
to get the vaccination.</TE>
<TE>   And there is nothing in the administration's plan to guarantee
that non-vaccinated workers will not suffer retribution, Stern said.</TE>
<TE>   "We took care of the pharmaceutical companies," Stern said,
referring to a liability provision in the law setting up the Homeland
Security Department, "but we haven't taken care of the health workers
yet."</TE>

<HD>Ban on Roads in Pristine National Forests Reinstated</HD>
<DH>An appeals court lifts an injunction on the Clinton-era
rule. But the White House refused to defend it, and several legal
challenges remain.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court has reinstated a Clinton administration ban
on road building in 58.5 million acres of remote national forest
land.</LD>
<LD>   For the time being, at least, the 2-1 ruling by a 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals panel of judges protects some of the most pristine
public forest land in the country from logging, mining and
development.</LD>
<LD>   It could also block hotly contested Bush administration logging
plans to reduce the wildfire threat in California's Sierra Nevada and
other parts of the West, according to environmentalists.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling, announced Thursday, lifts an injunction against the
ban that had been imposed by a federal district court in Boise,
Idaho, and returns the case to that court.</TE>
<TE>   While the roadless rule is back in effect, it faces legal
challenges in several courts around the country. The attorney
general-elect of Idaho vowed Thursday that his state would vigorously
pursue its lawsuit against the road-building ban.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's a very bad decision. It's bad for Idaho's jobs and
economy," said Lawrence Wasden, who takes office in January and is
currently chief of staff for the incumbent attorney general. Wasden
said his office will immediately seek a review by the full 9th
Circuit and will ask for another stay of the roadless rule.</TE>
<TE>   Should a second appeal fail, the case could then be taken to the
U.S. Supreme Court or returned to the district court for trial.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists, who have suffered a number of forest policy
defeats as the Bush administration attempts to weaken logging curbs
adopted under Clinton, were elated by the appeals opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "This decision blunts one of the major thrusts of this
administration's three-pronged assault on our national forests --
undoing roadless areas, undermining forest management regulations and
boosting logging under the guise of fire protection," said Rodger
Schlickeisen, president of Defenders of Wildlife, one of the
environmental groups who intervened in the case.</TE>
<TE>   "Again and again, the White House has made a strategic decision to
side with the timber industry against the overwhelming desires of the
American people, and the higher court just told them they picked the
wrong side," Schlickeisen said.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs in the case -- including Idaho, several snowmobile
clubs, the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho and timber industry giant Boise
Cascade Corp. -- claimed the federal government had failed to follow
the National Environmental Policy Act when preparing the roadless
rules.</TE>
<TE>   With strong language, the San Francisco panel rejected that
argument.</TE>
<TE>   Finding that the U.S. Forest Service had provided the public with
extensive information on the rule and allowed for meaningful public
debate and comment, the appeals court concluded that the plaintiffs
did not have a strong chance of prevailing in the case and therefore
an injunction should not have been issued.</TE>
<TE>   "The district court proceeded on an incorrect legal premise,
applied the wrong standard for injunction and abused its discretion
in issuing a preliminary injunction," the appeals court wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Bush administration has repeatedly said it supports
the principles behind the roadless rule, environmentalists argue that
its actions point to a different set of priorities.</TE>
<TE>   When the administration failed to appeal District Judge Edward J.
Lodge's injunction blocking the roadless policy, critics charged that
the White House had effectively abandoned a regulation not to its
liking. Moreover, the 9th Circuit cited the case's "unusual
procedural setting," in which the defendant, the Bush administration,
chose not to defend itself.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the appeals court's decision, U.S. Department of
Agriculture Undersecretary Mark Rey said Thursday that the agency
would allow the roadless regulations to take effect.</TE>
<TE>   "The Forest Service is committed to protecting and managing
roadless values and considers inventoried roadless areas an important
component of the national forest system," Rey said in a statement.
"Over the last year, we have been working toward a responsible and
balanced approach that fairly addresses concerns raised by states,
tribes and local communities impacted by the rule, and incorporates
the department's May 4, 2001, principles of informed decision making:
working together; protecting forests, communities, homes and property
from fire; and protecting access to property."</TE>
<TE>   However, the ban could interfere with the Forest Service's plans
to aggressively thin areas of national forests considered vulnerable
to fire. Environmentalists and some forest scientists have argued
that the plans are thinly veiled designs to give logging companies
access to some of the oldest and most commercially valuable timber.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the ban, I will not be surprised if the Forest Service
pushes ahead with its plans," said Neil Lawrence, a lawyer with the
Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the groups that appealed
the injunction imposed by the Idaho court. "Where they push ahead,
they will be challenged," Lawrence said.</TE>
<TE>   The road building ban was one of the more contentious
environmental regulations of the Clinton administration. Timber and
recreation interests have bitterly attacked it, while conservation
groups just as emphatically endorsed it as a badly needed protection
for remaining pristine national forest land.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic members of Congress said Thursday that the ruling will
force the Bush administration to abide by that protection.</TE>
<TE>   "This ruling tells the Bush administration that it cannot
arbitrarily bypass rules it doesn't like; rules must be written in
the light of day and with input from all of the public," said Sen.
Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.).</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Nick J. Rahall II of West Virginia, ranking Democrat on the
House Resources Committee, added: "Today's 9th Circuit decision
serves as welcome news for the American people who treasure our
national forests. As the court concludes, the Clinton administration
complied with environmental laws and fully involved the public in
developing its landmark and popular policy to protect the remaining
pristine national forest lands.</TE>
<TE>   "By contrast, the Bush administration -- which failed to appeal or
defend the Clinton roadless policy in the litigation -- is
aggressively seeking to reduce and even eliminate the public's role
in national forest management. The sad reality is that national
forest roadless areas are still not safe from the current
administration's chain saws."</TE>
<TE>   Marty Hayden, a lobbyist for the environmental group Earthjustice,
said the ruling would speak loudly to the other courts considering
cases challenging the road ban.</TE>
<TE>   "This doesn't tell the lower court what to rule, but it does send
a very strong signal to the lower court," Hayden said.</TE>
<TE>   In its opinion, the 9th Circuit noted the value of the remote
country protected by the roadless rule.</TE>
<TE>   "Roadless areas in our national forests also help conserve some of
the last unspoiled wilderness in our country," the panel wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "The unspoiled forest provides not only sheltering shade for the
visitor and sustenance for its diverse wildlife but also pure water
and fresh oxygen for humankind.</TE>
<TE>   "In contrast, road construction and reconstruction facilitates
forest management by timber harvest and possibly aiding fire
prevention, but it is to a degree inimical to conservation."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and the Clemency Board on Thursday restored the
civil rights of the FBI agent convicted of destroying records during
the investigation of the deadly 1992 shootout at Ruby Ridge in Idaho.</LD>
<LD>   E. Michael Kahoe, a former head of the FBI's violent crime and
major offenders section, pleaded guilty in 1997 to obstruction of
justice for ordering the destruction of an FBI report into the 1992
fatal shooting at the cabin of white separatist Randy Weaver.</LD>
<LD>   Convicted felons cannot vote in Florida unless their rights are
restored by the Clemency Board, made up of the governor and Cabinet.</LD>
<TE>   Kahoe recounted the details of the shootout, his role in
investigating the FBI's actions and his decision to destroy a report
to be sent to the U.S. attorney in Idaho. The report could have been
used by lawyers representing Weaver, whose wife and son were killed
during an 11-day standoff with government agents at Weaver's rural
cabin.</TE>

<HD>SUVs Would Have to Improve Gas Mileage Under Bush Plan</HD>
<DH>In the first such change in six years, the fuel economy
standard would increase by 1.5 mpg by 2007. Initiative also targets
pickups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Shogren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration on Thursday proposed a slight increase in
fuel economy ratings for sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks,
the first change in fuel economy standards in six years.</LD>
<LD>   The initiative, which likely will be made final by April, would
increase by 1.5 miles per gallon the fuel economy standards for SUVs,
vans, minivans and pickup trucks.</LD>
<LD>   The increased fuel economy would come in three annual stages of
0.3 mpg, 0.6 mpg and 0.6 mpg, consecutively, starting in 2005.</LD>
<TE>   It could save about 2.5 billion gallons of gasoline a year and aid
the environment, according to Transportation Department officials.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration is committed to improving fuel economy
while protecting passenger safety and American jobs," said
Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers can be fined if the average fuel economy of their
entire line of vehicles sold does not meet the government's
"corporate average fuel economy" standards.</TE>
<TE>   The current standard for SUVs, vans and light trucks is 20.7 mpg;
it would increase to 22.2 mpg by the 2007 model year under this
proposal. The passenger-car standard of 27.5 mpg remains unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   Interested parties now have 60 days to comment on the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is required by
law to set the toughest standard that is both economically and
technologically feasible.</TE>
<TE>   Before setting the standard, officials gather information from
manufacturers about their plans for the relevant model years. They
also do their own analysis of what would be achievable, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The action came after Congress failed to give any direction to the
administration on the topic after heatedly debating the issue while
considering energy legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, some Democrats blasted the administration's effort as
too modest.</TE>
<TE>   They said it misses an important chance to reduce dependence on
foreign fuel and reduce the country's contribution to global warming.</TE>
<TE>   Cars and light trucks combined produce about one-fifth of U.S.
carbon-dioxide emissions, which most scientists believe play a major
role in global warming.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an insult," said Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.). "The
administration is merely ratifying less than what industry is already
doing on its own without challenge or incentive."</TE>
<TE>   A proposal by Kerry and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) to require the
government to raise the corporate average fuel economy standard for
passenger cars and light trucks to 36 mpg by 2015 was defeated
earlier this year. Kerry, who is considering a run for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 2004, accused the White House of failing
to confront the reality of America's weakness because of its
dependence on foreign oil.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Americans deserve more than another sham White House
effort to pretend to act in the interests of energy security," Kerry
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) said he would work in the next
Congress to increase the standard.</TE>
<TE>   "This proposed increase in fuel economy for SUVs doesn't even come
close to what could be achieved using technologies that are already
available," he said. "This scheme is absolutely irresponsible and
will do next to nothing to reduce our dependence on Middle Eastern
oil."</TE>
<TE>   The auto makers, however, said the proposal represents a
significant change.</TE>
<TE>   It will present varying degrees of challenge to manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   For producers such as Honda that focus on smaller vehicles, the
standard will not be much of a stretch. But for those with fleets
dominated by larger vehicles, the proposal will be more of a hurdle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a considerable challenge," said Eron Shosteck, a
spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which
represents 12 companies responsible for 90% of the vehicle sales in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The problem facing auto makers is that consumers favor the bigger
vehicles with more options -- such as larger cargo holds -- that end
up using more fuel.</TE>
<TE>   "Only the cars that are sold count" toward the corporate average
fuel economy standard, Shosteck said. "Consumers are in the driver's
seat."</TE>
<TE>   As SUVs and other light trucks have gained in popularity, overall
passenger fuel economy has declined. Passenger vehicles use about 40%
of the 19 million barrels of oil consumed nationwide each day.</TE>
<TE>   Like most industries, Shosteck said, manufacturers respond to what
consumers want.</TE>
<TE>   While criticizing the initiative as too weak, some
environmentalists said it represents a small step in the right
direction after a stalemate on the issue since 1996, when Congress
imposed a freeze on the federal fuel economy requirements on
manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   "First, its timetable recognizes that beneficial design changes
are available to improve efficiency without delay. Also, by targeting
light trucks, it focuses on the most important part of the fuel
consumption problem. Finally, the proposal validates the [corporate
average fuel economy] standard as a valuable tool, in spite of U.S.
auto makers' misleading campaigns against it," said John DeCicco, a
senior fellow and automotive specialist at Environmental Defense, a
national environmental group.</TE>

<HD>El Nino Returns and Major Weather Changes Predicted</HD>
<DH>Severe winter is seen for the East, severe drought in the
Midwest and more rain in California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Usha Lee McFarling</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>El Nino is back.</LD>
<LD>   Government forecasters Thursday issued a new El Nino forecast,
saying that the weather system has arrived and will pummel the East
Coast with blizzards and ice storms this winter and exacerbate the
extreme drought that has decimated corn, wheat and soybean crops in
the Midwest. It is also expected to bring much needed rain to
California.</LD>
<LD>   Though they are still calling El Nino a moderate one, government
forecasters said they expect the weather disruptions to be stronger
and last longer than had been predicted last fall.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a classic El Nino pattern," said Conrad C. Lautenbacher
Jr., administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.</TE>
<TE>   El Nino was expected to bring rains across the southern part of
the country, from California to the Carolinas. Those rains are
already on the way.</TE>
<TE>   A set of powerful rainstorms expected to hit the state this
weekend are the classic calling card of the weather pattern, El Nino
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely have the makings of something here," said Bill
Patzert, an oceanographer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, who said satellites that track changes in ocean
temperatures now clearly show strong El Nino warming in a fat band
around the equator. "It could really bring a soaking."</TE>
<TE>   El Nino occurs when the waters of the equatorial Pacific remain
warmer than usual for several months. That warmth triggers
atmospheric and weather changes around the globe, including floods in
Ecuador and drought in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   El Nino means little boy in Spanish. The weather pattern is named
after the Christ child because South American fishermen first noticed
the phenomenon near Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   This year's forecasting job has been tricky because the El Nino
pattern did not start to develop strongly until a few weeks ago. NOAA
forecasters who predicted a moderate El Nino despite the lack of
strong ocean warming this fall ended up making the correct
prediction.</TE>
<TE>   El Nino is not expected to bring quite as much rain to California
-- or last as long -- as the massive El Nino of the winter of
1997-98, which brought 31 inches of rain to Los Angeles in a one-year
period, Patzert said. That El Nino is blamed for 25,000 deaths around
the world. Though smaller, this year's El Nino still could usher in a
rainy winter. The moderate El Nino of 1992-93 helped boost rainfall
in Los Angeles for that period to 27 inches.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good news forecast," said Patzert, who monitored the
historic lack of rain in Southern California over the last year. "We
need the water."</TE>

<HD>Music Leaves Its Mark on the Brain</HD>
<DH>If it's pleasing to the ears, it's tied to rewired circuits
that find notes harmonious, study says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Lee Hotz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>From Mozart to Miles Davis, the harmonies of Western music rewire the
brain, creating patterns of neural activity at the confluence of
emotion and memory that strengthen with each new melody, research
made public Thursday shows.</LD>
<LD>   By monitoring the brains of people listening to classical scales
and key progressions, scientists at Dartmouth College glimpsed the
biology of the hit-making machinery of popular song. Focusing on the
structure of Western music, researchers show how the musical mind
hears the flat notes in Flatt and Scruggs, the sharps of the
Harmonicats and all five octaves in pop diva Mariah Carey's
repertoire.</LD>
<LD>   The flash-dance of these brain circuits, which process the
harmonic relationship of musical notes, is shaped by a human craving
for melody that drives people to spend more every year on music than
on prescription drugs. The circuits center in a brain region that
responds equally to the musical patterns of Eminem's hip-hop busta
rhymes and Bach's baroque fugues.</LD>
<TE>   "Music is not necessary for human survival, yet something inside
us craves it," said Dartmouth music psychologist Petr Janata, who led
the global research team. "Our minds have internalized the music."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reason, the effect on the individual brain is
measurable.</TE>
<TE>   Among expert musicians, certain areas of the cortex are up to 5%
larger than in people with little or no musical training, recent
research shows. In musicians who started their training in early
childhood, the neural bridge that links the brain's hemispheres,
called the corpus callosum, is up to 15% larger. A professional
musician's auditory cortex -- the part of the brain associated with
hearing -- contains 130% more gray matter than that of non-musicians.</TE>
<TE>   The new study, published today in Science, shows for the first
time that the abstract knowledge about the harmonic relationships in
music inscribes itself on the human cortex, guiding expectations of
how musical notes should relate to one another as they are played.
Through constant exposure, synapses are trained to respond like a
series of tuning forks to the tones characteristic of Western music,
several experts said. So far, no one has tested the music of other
cultures, but researchers speculate that all music should have the
same effect.</TE>
<TE>   The pattern in the music literally becomes a pattern in the brain.
"It shows this link between music theory and perception and brain
function," said Frances H. Rauscher, an expert in music cognition at
the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh. "No one had looked before."</TE>
<TE>   The Dartmouth group scanned eight people with a functional
magnetic resonance imager as they listened to an eight-minute melody
specially composed to move continuously through all 24 major and
minor musical keys. The volunteers, who each had about 12 years of
musical training, performed several music-related tasks while they
listened in the scanner.</TE>
<TE>   The scanner, which records changes in blood flow associated with
mental processing, allowed the scientists to watch this meandering of
keys as the music traced a path across the surface of the cortex.</TE>
<TE>   Although music activated many parts of the brain, the researchers
discovered that everyone had just one area in common that tracked and
processed melodies. That brain region, near the center of the
forehead, is called the rostromedial prefrontal cortex. This region,
which links to short- and long-term memory and emotions, is different
from areas involved in more basic sound processing.</TE>
<TE>   "In the same way that tracing the path of a car allows one to
infer the underlying map of a city's streets, the path traced by the
keys along the cortex allowed the researchers to see the underlying
structure," explained David Huron, head of the cognitive and
systematic musicology laboratory at Ohio State University.</TE>
<TE>   "It is beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Since the first primitive human ancestor carved a flute from a
bear bone more than 50,000 years ago, melody, harmony and rhythm have
stirred people of every culture. No one knows how or why music
evolved to become such an important human activity. "Music is really
popular, but what does it do for the brain?" asked Janata. "Why is it
we have the emotional responses we do to music? Why is it that
melodies run spontaneously through our heads?"</TE>
<TE>   Music may be as much in the genes as in the soul.</TE>
<TE>   Perfect pitch, for example, appears to be inherited, only to be
lost if not reinforced by practice. By 4 months of age, babies
already prefer the more musical intervals of major and minor thirds
to the more dissonant sounds of minor seconds, researchers have
shown.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Shaw and Mark Bodner, brain experts at the Music
Intelligence Neural Development Institute in Irvine, emphasized,
however, that there is nothing special about Western music, at least
as far as brain anatomy and neural networks are concerned. These
distinctive musical circuits in the cortex could be just as easily
tuned by exposure to the music of the Aborigine didgeridoo, Tuvan
throat-singing or Japanese court gagaku.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a brain structure that has adapted to the way the music
is," Huron said. "This is a manifestation of Western culture that is
appearing on the cortex, not some innate structure."</TE>
<TE>   Within this brain region, however, a melody creates a slightly
different pattern of neural activity every time it is heard, as if
the laser reading the digital pattern of a compact disc recording
varied the pattern slightly each time the music was played.</TE>
<TE>   This dynamic map may be the key to understanding why a piece of
music might elicit a certain behavior one time, such as dancing, and
something different another time, such as smiling when remembering a
dance, the researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it might explain why when you hear a piece of music one
time, it might move you to dance," said Janata. "When you hear it
another time, you might instead remember the party or the feelings
you had there."</TE>

<HD>Smallpox Strike Called Unlikely</HD>
<DH>Scenario is discounted because the virus is hard to test or
deploy. Experts say suicidal efforts to spark an epidemic would
probably fail.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the ultimate fear in the post-9/11 era: Terrorists infect
themselves with smallpox, then before the telltale pustules spread
across their bodies, they spend a day at LAX -- talking, coughing,
touching chairs and counters, spreading contagion via travelers to
every corner of the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Other scenarios are just as terrifying: the unleashing of a
smallpox bomb that sprays a city with the deadly virus, or the
release of genetically engineered smallpox for which there is no
protection.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush's expected announcement today of a nationwide
smallpox vaccination plan has pushed these visions of horror to the
forefront of the public consciousness.</LD>
<TE>   But as the government prepares for a possible smallpox attack,
some experts say that such scenarios, while possible, are not likely.</TE>
<TE>   Smallpox is difficult to handle and experts believe its victims
are contagious for no more than a day before the excruciating rash
erupts -- an obvious sign of infection that would immediately mark
any carrier, said Clarence J. Peters, director of the Center of
Biodefense at the University of Texas medical school in Galveston.
Before the disease's infectious phase, a would-be bioterrorist would
show debilitating flu-like symptoms, making it difficult to move
around in public inconspicuously. Peters said the disease also must
be spread by close contact -- more than merely crossing paths with a
carrier or brushing past the same ticket counter.</TE>
<TE>   The scientific and technological challenges of creating smallpox
bombs or genetically altered smallpox agents also make those
possibilities somewhat distant, said Jonathan Tucker, author of
"Scourge: The Once and Future Threat of Smallpox." Advanced
bioweapons would cost millions to develop, yet would be difficult to
test for all but the most advanced nations because of the extreme
danger.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still quite unlikely that smallpox would be used as a
weapon," Tucker said.</TE>
<TE>   Smallpox was declared eradicated from the world in 1980. The only
legal stocks of the virus that were not destroyed are small amounts
held by the U.S. and Russia in highly secured labs. Today's fears
stem from former Soviet scientists who manufactured and maintained
tons of the virus in violation of international law. Some of those
experts may have sold deadly samples.</TE>
<TE>   But even if terrorists obtain stocks of smallpox, suicidal efforts
to provoke an epidemic would be easily prone to failure.</TE>
<TE>   Life of Virus</TE>
<TE>   Once a person is infected, the incubation period is seven to 17
days, followed by body aches, high fever and dizziness -- and often
severe abdominal pain and even delirium. Yet the person would not be
contagious until the appearance of a rapidly spreading rash,
according to a consensus of the nation's leading smallpox experts
published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy is going to feel terrible; he is going to be walking
around, not shedding virus until maybe the day before, or the day of
the rash," Peters said. "He may be obviously ill, a fever, a flushed
face and bumps on his face."</TE>
<TE>   If the carrier survives, contagion lasts until the very noticeable
scabs from smallpox pustules have completely healed, three weeks or
more later.</TE>
<TE>   In a few cases, terrible outbreaks have been started by a single
unwitting victim. For example, a Yugoslav Muslim contracted smallpox
during a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1972, returned home and started an
epidemic that eventually caused 150 cases, including dozens of
deaths. In response, authorities imposed a massive quarantine and
vaccinated millions.</TE>
<TE>   Yet such single-source episodes are the exception, because
smallpox is more difficult to transmit than many other infectious
diseases. New contacts must have direct contact with viral particles
shed from pustules on the skin, or those coughed up from the mouth or
throat. Once in the open environment, the virus wouldn't survive for
long, experts say, except in cool, dry conditions.</TE>
<TE>   This combination of factors has historically caused smallpox to
spread more slowly than such childhood ailments as chickenpox. In
general, smallpox victims pass the disease to family members or
hospital workers, rather than casual contacts. Even the Yugoslav
carrier spread contagion almost exclusively to hospital workers.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Yugoslav authorities who were caught by surprise with
their nation's first smallpox episode in more than four decades, this
country is on a high state of alert. The U.S. public health
infrastructure is better equipped to rapidly respond to an outbreak,
the vast majority of victims can be saved by taking the vaccine
within three days of exposure and even as long as seven days after
exposure, the vaccine can reduce the severity of the disease.</TE>
<TE>   A lone, infected terrorist, or a small group "could certainly do
some damage," Peters said. "But he's not going to cruise through
[John F.] Kennedy [International] Airport and leave hundreds of
people infected behind him. This whole scenario that there's going to
be massive spread by people that nobody notices is not realistic."</TE>
<TE>   Russian Weapons</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, a smallpox bomb or sprayer that floats the virus over
a wide area would be much more likely to spark an epidemic, experts
say. Such weapons were developed in Russia well into the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, I know of a number of examples about possible
involvement of some Soviet and Russian scientists in collaboration
with some countries like Iraq and Iran," said Ken Alibek, formerly a
top scientist in the Soviet biological warfare program. He defected
to the United States in 1992, and now directs a biodefense institute
at George Mason University, in Manassas, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even with expert help, such weapons would be technically
difficult to construct, said Peters, who formerly headed the Disease
Assessment Division at the Army's primary biological defense lab at
Ft. Detrick, Md.</TE>
<TE>   The smallpox virus must be grown in living cells, typically within
fertilized eggs, he said, then refined under precise conditions. A
gooey mass of smallpox-laden egg protein must be turned into a liquid
or ultra-fine powder. It then must be packaged in a bomb or other
disseminator that can gently release the microscopic particles so
they are not destroyed and float freely in the air, Peters said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if terrorist groups could overcome the technical problems,
there is still a powerful disincentive for them to pursue such a
strategy since developing the weapons would pose an enormous risk of
accidental release.</TE>
<TE>   Such stumbling blocks helped fuel a debate about how widely to
vaccinate the population beyond health-care workers, soldiers and
public safety officials. President Bush ultimately decided to offer
the vaccine to all Americans on a voluntary basis when sufficient
licensed supplies are available.</TE>
<TE>   "It comes down to a weighing of risks," Tucker said.</TE>
<TE>   A terrorism-related smallpox epidemic could be contained with
relatively few deaths, he said, but may still provoke widespread
panic. In a national vaccination campaign many thousands of people
would certainly suffer serious side effects, and as many as several
hundred could die. Yet society as a whole might accept that toll as a
fair price for a sense of greater security.</TE>
<TE>   The most horrifying smallpox scenario -- the development of an
altered strain engineered to defeat the vaccine -- gained currency
last year. A team of Australian researchers spliced the gene for the
human hormone interleukin-4, which affects immune response, into
mousepox, a virus related to smallpox that cannot infect people.
Their goal was innocent: They wanted to reduce mouse fertility.</TE>
<TE>   Their result sent chills through the biodefense community. The
experiment created a super mousepox strain that even killed mice that
had been previously immunized.</TE>
<TE>   Most exerts accept the possibility that a genetically engineered,
super smallpox virus can be created. But aside from the tremendous
dangers of handling so deadly and incurable a microbe, other
drawbacks make them doubt anyone would try.</TE>
<TE>   "You can add genes to smallpox, but what we don't know is whether
you are getting the effect you want," Peters said. "I could never be
sure it was a decent [biological warfare] agent unless I tested it."</TE>
<TE>   Testing on humans would be a monumental gamble. Because only
people contract smallpox, the weapon's effectiveness could not be
tested on animals.</TE>
<TE>   Such concerns reflect a more general skepticism about the efficacy
of medical defenses against bioterrorism. Many diseases beyond
smallpox have been turned into weapons in the past, so a
sophisticated attacker might avoid smallpox if the target population
has been vaccinated, and instead use a weapon such as plague or
anthrax. Vaccinating against every possible threat is next to
impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "When you talk about biological terrorism, I would not spend even
a penny on vaccines," Alibek said. "Protecting an entire population
[in advance] against biological warfare is not feasible."</TE>

<TE>   The disease</TE>
<TE>   Caused by the variola virus, smallpox is an ancient and highly
contagious disease. The most serious form has a fatality rate of 30%
or more. In the 20th century alone, an estimated 300 million people
died of smallpox worldwide. Here's a look at the disease and its
history:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Exposure</TE>
<TE>   How it spreads: Spread by inhaling infected saliva droplets,
usually through coughing; direct contact with scabs, bedding or
contaminated clothing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Phases and duration</TE>
<TE>   Incubation period (seven to 17 days) -- Not contagious</TE>
<TE>   Initial symptoms (two to four days) -- Sometimes contagious.</TE>
<TE>   First symptoms include fever, malaise, head and body aches.</TE>
<TE>   Early rash (About four days) -- Most contagious</TE>
<TE>   Pustular rash (About five days) -- Contagious. Rash turns into
small blisters that become pustules.</TE>
<TE>   Pustules and scabs (About five days) -- Contagious</TE>
<TE>   Resolving scabs (About six days) -- Contagious</TE>
<TE>   Scabs resolved -- Not contagious</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Treatment/Prevention</TE>
<TE>   Vaccination: Will prevent infection up to 10 years. The vaccine
contains another live virus called vaccinia. It does not contain
smallpox virus. The vaccine can produce serious side effects, from
severe rashes to brain inflammation, killing an estimated</TE>
<TE>   one in 1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Treatment: There is currently no proven treatment or cure, but
vaccine given within four days of exposure can lessen severity.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vaccine stockpiles</TE>
<TE>   There are currently enough doses to vaccinate everyone in the U.S.
in case of an outbreak. Fully licensed vaccine will become available
by 2004.</TE>

<LD>SEATTLE AT ATLANTA</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   The line: Atlanta by 10</LD>
<TE>   Quick slant: The Candy Man can.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: While Seahawk trainers pore over the results of Matt
Hasselbeck's ankle MRI -- warming up in the bullpen ... Jeff George
-- the Falcons and the media and fans in Atlanta are concerned with
happier issues, such as which candy Michael Vick is going to endorse.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Web site conducted a poll asking,
"What candy endorsement would best suit Mike Vick's playing style
best?" Tied for the lead with 25% of the vote: Mr. Goodbar (the
Vikings are still looking for him) and 100 Grand. What about Nestle's
Crunch? Or didn't they watch Vick against Tampa Bay last game?</TE>

<TE>   N.Y. JETS AT CHICAGO</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New York by 6 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Poor Dick Jauron.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The pressure appears to be getting to Chicago's Jauron, who
in 12 months has regressed from NFL Coach of the Year to a
hollow-eyed wreck muttering to himself like a crazy person. Recently,
when asked by reporters about the status of his radio show, Jauron
replied, "It's not my show, but I'm on that show." When asked how
Bear Roosevelt Williams could get caught and dragged down from behind
on his fumble return against Green Bay, Jauron said it was because of
Williams "not getting into an athletic rhythm." Judging from
Chicago's 3-10 record, Williams isn't the only Bear with that
affliction.</TE>

<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2</TE>
<TE>   The line: Miami by 1 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Save Marino's record!</TE>
<TE>   Plot: That's the Dolphins' battle cry as Raider Rich Gannon
invades Miami on pace to break Dan Marino's single-season passing
mark of 5,084 yards. After logging his 10th 300-yard passing game
this season, which broke another Marino record, Gannon remains on
pace to pass for 5,175 yards. As you might expect, this hasn't sat
well with Marino, who says Gannon should not be the league's most
valuable player because "I would pay to watch Michael Vick play. I
wouldn't pay to watch Rich Gannon play, so Michael Vick is the MVP."
With logic like that, Jay Fiedler would be out of football by now.</TE>

<TE>   TAMPA BAY AT DETROIT</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Tampa Bay by 8 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Be careful what you wish for.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The Buccaneers chew up young quarterbacks, don't they? It
hasn't been a week since the Tampa Bay defense clamped down on
Michael Vick and here goes Detroit's Joey Harrington, popping off
about wanting to get "ear-holed" by Warren Sapp. See, young Joey
tried to explain, he once read an interview in which Sapp said he
respected Brett Favre because Favre kept getting up after Sapp hit
him and, well, young Joey, wants that same kind of respect. Sapp told
Detroit reporters he would try to accommodate the rookie. "Oh, yeah,
definitely," he said. "If they're going to give up one of them."</TE>

<TE>   BALTIMORE AT HOUSTON</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Baltimore by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Houston's offensive strategy? Yes, it is.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: "Nothing from nothing leaves nothing." Old Billy Preston
lyric? Or new Texan offensive game plan? Sunday in Pittsburgh, the
Texans amassed 47 yards and three first downs -- and still won, 24-6,
thanks to three defensive touchdowns. Texan tight end Billy Miller
was so embarrassed, he returned to practice wearing a cap that read
"Texans Special Teams." And this was after Miller probably set a
record by becoming the first tight end to make all his team's catches
in a single game. Yes, he caught all three. So why the embarrassment?
The Ravens once won a Super Bowl playing exactly this way.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Ravens Remember Good Old Days, Win, 9-3"</TE>

<TE>   SAN DIEGO AT BUFFALO</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Buffalo by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Me and you and two quarterbacks named Drew.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: It's old Drew against new Drew as Bledsoe and Brees try to
keep their respective teams' playoff hopes flickering Sunday amid
snow blowers and hand warmers. At 6-7, Bledsoe's Bills are at the end
of their rope, which explains why they are favored over the 8-5
Chargers. Another reason: The Chargers are 2-4 in their last six
games. "We're definitely living on the edge," San Diego Coach Marty
Schottenheimer says. "We've got a few plays with [Doug] Flutie at
wide receiver ... I'm serious. Why not?" Other than Flutie being 40,
pint-sized and a quarterback, it sounds like a stroke of genius.</TE>

<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Pittsburgh by 8 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Steelers give thanks: No more expansion teams on the
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: As long as the NFL keeps expanding, the Steelers will be
there to distribute welcome-to-the-neighborhood gifts. In 1995, the
Steelers lost to the expansion Jaguars, 20-16. In 1999, the Steelers
lost to the expansion Browns, 16-15. And last week, the Steelers lost
to the expansion Texans, 24-6, despite advantages of 375 more yards
and 21 more first downs. At the same time, the Panthers, a '95
expansion team, were scoring 52 points against Cincinnati to win
their second game in a row. If the Steelers aren't concerned, they
should be. A very nasty quarterback controversy is only another upset
away.</TE>

<TE>   MINNESOTA AT NEW ORLEANS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New Orleans by 7</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Before the yellow flags, we distinctly saw the white
one.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: And all this time we thought the fight had gone out of the
Vikings somewhere around the kickoff of the 2000 NFC final. How about
that scrum against the Packers at the end of Minnesota's
come-from-ahead loss to Green Bay? Might the awful officiating in
that game have triggered the Vikings' temper? It's possible,
considering that the league admitted the officials committed nine
mistakes in the Packers' 26-22 victory -- most of them at the expense
of the Vikings. That explains one Minnesota defeat. What about the
other 11, including the one coming Sunday in the Superdome?</TE>

<TE>   TV: Channel 11</TE>
<TE>   The line: Philadelphia by 7 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Andy Reid shows Steve Spurrier a thing or two about
shuffling quarterbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: If you were an NFL coach and into messing with your
quarterbacks' minds, as Spurrier is, or just desperate for an able
body to line up over center, as Reid is, which quarterbacks would you
rather shuffle? Donovan McNabb, Koy Detmer and A.J. Feeley? Or Shane
Matthews, Danny Wuerffel and Patrick Ramsey? The 10-3 Eagles know the
answer. Sunday, Reid will give Feeley his third NFL start while
Spurrier's blindfolded dart throw wound up hitting Ramsey's name
again. What does it all mean? Very soon, the 11-3 Eagles will provide
the answer.</TE>

<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Jacksonville by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Last-ever Coughlin-LeBeau matchup?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Good relations with the team owner can carry a coach only so
far, as Cincinnati's Dick LeBeau and Jacksonville's Tom Coughlin may
soon find out. Even Mike Brown probably noticed that Cincinnati's
52-31 loss to Carolina was especially wretched, even by Bengal
standards. Jaguar owner Wayne Weaver criticized Coughlin's defensive
strategy on last week's game-losing Hail Mary pass against Cleveland.
"He's entitled to his opinion," Coughlin said, "and, yes, we should
have had five guys standing there at the 20-yard line ... Wayne is
right and that's that." Or at least Coughlin hopes.</TE>

<TE>   The line: Indianapolis by 2 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Football gods cut Browns their break.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: If it's true that the breaks always even out in the end,
does last week's Hail Mary game-winner against Jacksonville balance
the ledger for the Browns three months after Dwayne Rudd's infamous
helmet spike? And if so, does that mean the Browns are back on their
own? By all rights, this game should be meaningless for Cleveland,
which trailed the Jaguars the entire game, until the clock read
"0:00" and Quincy Morgan had the ball in the end zone. Coupled with
the Steelers' giveaway to Houston, the Browns remain a half-game out
of first. Down side: the Browns are 2-4 in Cleveland.</TE>

<TE>   Quick slant: Does the best offense in football belong in the
playoffs?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Can Priest Holmes break Marshall Faulk's single-season total
yards and touchdown records? Can Trent Green break Len Dawson's
single-season club record for touchdown passes? Can the Chiefs break
.500? Bidding to become the eighth team to score 500 points in a
season, Kansas City is also bidding to become the first 500-point
team to miss the playoffs. At 7-6, the Chiefs probably need to sweep
their remaining Denver-San Diego-Oakland gantlet to assure a playoff
berth. That hard road begins in Denver, with the Broncos also 7-6 and
desperate to end a three-game losing streak.</TE>

<TE>   The line: New York by 5</TE>
<TE>   The slant: Last-ever Campo-Fassel matchup?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Jim Fassel won an NFC championship for the Giants two years
ago. Dave Campo is well-liked by Dallas owner Jerry Jones because he
does what Jones tells him. But both coaches find their goodwill
reserves running close to empty after recent events -- Fassel
mishandling the Dec. 1 loss to Tennessee, Campo blowing another lead
against San Francisco, the Cowboys' seventh loss this season when
ahead or tied in the fourth quarter. "Everybody's counting us out but
we're still alive," Fassel said after the Giants beat Washington last
week. "It will be over when we say it's over." Yeah, right.</TE>

<TE>   TV: Channel 11</TE>
<TE>   The line: San Francisco by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Favre locates more devout cowards.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Preparing for this late-season clash of teams that peaked
too soon, Green Bay's Brett Favre studied the newspaper quotes from
Jeff Garcia and Terrell Owens griping about the 49ers' "conservative"
offensive play-calling and believes he has spotted a weakness. "If
you have a beef with [the coach], go to his office," Favre said
during a conference call this week. "Be a man and go face to face
with him and tell him you have a problem with what is going on. Don't
do it in the paper. That's kind of cowardly." That's why Favre is 8-1
in his last nine meetings with the 49ers. And going on 9-1.</TE>

<TE>   TV: ESPN</TE>
<TE>   The line: St. Louis by 11</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Cardinals return to St. Louis. Big deal.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Two teams already playing for next year -- although in the
case of the Cardinals, considering what's gone on with them in the
last 60 years, you'd have to say: Why bother? How bad are the
Cardinals? The Cardinals won last week, the Rams have been eliminated
from playoff contention, Kurt Warner won't play, Marshall Faulk might
not play. The Rams are still favored by 11 points. One reason why:
Marc Bulger, the only Ram quarterback to win a game this season,
returns to the lineup, kicking off the NFL's greatest quarterback
controversy of 2003 10 months early.</TE>

<TE>   TV: Channel 7</TE>
<TE>   The line: Tennessee by 2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: A fine mess they've gotten themselves into.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: After 13 weeks on the sideline, defensive end Jevon Kearse
is scheduled to return to the Tennessee lineup against New England.
Patriot offensive tackle Kenyatta Jones draws the assignment of
trying to contain Kearse and insists it's no big deal. "I don't go
into a game thinking I have to play against this guy or that guy,"
Jones told the Boston Herald. "You have to come in and play me.
That's the way I look at it. We're all here for a reason." Yes, the
Patriots are 8-5 and the Titans are 8-5 and they're both in this
must-win situation because they didn't take care of business earlier
in the season.</TE>

<HD>Palmer Gets Thrown for Loss on National TV</HD>
<DH>USC quarterback is left on bench to watch fellow Heisman
finalists parade to podium on award show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carson Palmer is a finalist for the Heisman Trophy, but USC's senior
quarterback was a spectator Thursday night in Lake Buena Vista, Fla.,
during the Home Depot College Football Awards Show.</LD>
<LD>   He sat in the audience as other Heisman finalists made their way
to the stage to collect awards in front of a national television
audience.</LD>
<LD>   Iowa quarterback Brad Banks was selected over Palmer and Ken
Dorsey of Miami for the Davey O'Brien Award, presented annually to
the nation's top quarterback. Banks also was named to the Walter Camp
All-America team.</LD>
<TE>   Penn State running back Larry Johnson won the Maxwell Award as the
top player and the Doak Walker Award as top running back. Dorsey and
running back Willis McGahee also joined Banks and Johnson on the
All-America team.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer said it was not frustrating to watch other Heisman
finalists collect various trophies.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just happy to be here and be a part of the whole thing," he
said. "It was fun to meet everyone up close and get to know them."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's announcements will have no impact on the Heisman voting
because Wednesday was the deadline to submit ballots. But they
furthered the notion that this year's Heisman race could be one of
the closest in history.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer will travel to Louisville, Ky., today to receive the Johnny
Unitas Golden Arm Award as the nation's top senior quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Then it's on to New York, where Banks, Dorsey, Johnson and McGahee
will join him for the Heisman Trophy announcement in another national
telecast.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still excited about going out [to New York] and being a part
of the deal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   USC safety Troy Polamalu was a finalist for the Thorpe Award, won
by Kansas State cornerback Terence Newman. Polamalu was selected to
the Camp All-America team.</TE>
<TE>   Other awards presented Thursday:</TE>
<TE>   Outland Trophy (lineman): Rien Long, Washington State; Ray Guy
Award (punter): Mark Mariscal, Colorado; Biletnikoff Award
(receiver): Charles Rogers, Michigan State; Coach of the Year: Tyrone
Willingham, Notre Dame; Chuck Bednarik Trophy (defensive player):

<LD>Robert Atwater conned his way into the SBC Senior Classic in March
2001, conned the Senior PGA Tour about his age and conned The Times
into doing a story about him.</LD>
<LD>   Now he is a con -- as in convict.</LD>
<LD>   Atwater pleaded guilty to a federal drug charge Tuesday. Atwater
had been a fugitive since a July 1990 indictment for money laundering
and drug trafficking. He faces a minimum 10 years in federal prison.</LD>
<TE>   Atwater played the SBC Senior Classic at Valencia Country Club
under the name Darren Muarry. He drew attention at the tournament
because he hit 300-yard drives with a cross-handed grip.</TE>
<TE>   He caddied for SBC official Laura Woods the previous year and
coaxed her into a sponsor exemption, then shot 85-82-79 and finished
last.</TE>
<TE>   Atwater had provided identification to tour officials that said
his name was Darren Muarry and he was 50, the minimum age to play the
event. Court records, however, show he was 49 at the time he played.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Atwater's defense
attorney could not offer much information about his client, saying
only, "He said he beat Tiger Woods."</TE>
<TE>   Sure thing, Bob.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the last Miami player to win the Heisman
Trophy?</TE>
<TE>   Granddaddy of them all: The Hollywood Reporter notes that MGM is
nearing a deal with Sylvester Stallone to write and star in "Rocky
VI." The story would find a 50-year-old Rocky lured out of retirement
for a final fight.</TE>
<TE>   No confirmation on this, but actors under consideration to play
Rocky's opponent are Wilford Brimley, Bob Hope, Marlon Brando and
Leslie Nielsen.</TE>
<TE>   Hall of shame: Former baseball commissioner Fay Vincent said if
the ban on Pete Rose is lifted and the all-time hits leader is
elected to the Hall of Fame, the plaque should indicate the gambling
exploits that got Rose banned.</TE>
<TE>   Good ol' paperboys' network: Apparently the New York Times isn't
the only paper pulling stories about the flap between Augusta
National Golf Club and Martha Burk, who is crusading to get a female
admitted to the Georgia club.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Washington Post, the Augusta Chronicle moved a
lengthy profile of Burk from the front page to Page 10 and pulled an
accompanying question-and-answer story. The paper also refused to run
a piece that urged the club to admit a woman.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, one more thing. The owner and publisher of the paper, William
"Billy" Morris, is a longtime Augusta member.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Gino Torretta, 1992.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Keith Olbermann of ABC Radio wasn't enthralled by the
selection of Lance Armstrong as Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the
Year, saying:</TE>
<TE>   "Two years ago when Armstrong crossed picket lines to make a TV
commercial, he rationalized it by saying he was a cancer survivor who
had to look out for his family -- completely ignoring the fact that
of hundreds of people who make a few thousand dollars a year making
commercials, certainly some of them had cancer in their families and
none of them considered themselves too special to dishonor the strike
by a union which Armstrong had joined."</TE>

<HD>Olowokandi to Return in Time to Face Spurs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>Michael Olowokandi will be activated today after spending five games
on the injured list because of tendinitis in his left knee. Just in
time to face three 7-footers.</LD>
<LD>   "He seems healthy to me," Coach Alvin Gentry said Thursday after
watching Olowokandi and his teammates during a spirited workout at
the San Antonio Spurs' practice facility. "His leg is ready to go."</LD>
<LD>   How the Clippers make room for Olowokandi on their roster will be
determined before the team plays San Antonio's trio of 7-footers, Tim
Duncan, David Robinson and Kevin Willis, tonight in their first visit
to the new SBC Center.</LD>
<TE>   Eric Piatkowski said the lower abdominal strain that forced him
from Tuesday's 27-point loss to the Dallas Mavericks would sideline
him for tonight's game against the Spurs and Saturday's against the
Houston Rockets.</TE>
<TE>   "If Pike seems like he'll be ready after two games, then we'll
probably have to put somebody else on the injured list," Gentry said.
"We'll see what's going on [today]."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers won three games while Olowokandi was sidelined.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lamar Odom's sprained right wrist and ankle, which have sidelined
him for 11 months, are getting better. Odom's target date to return
is Dec. 28, when the Clippers play host to the Golden State Warriors.
Of particular concern is his ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "We want him to string three or four practices together without
any swelling or discomfort," said trainer Jasen Powell.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see it as Lamar being able to make a nice look-away
pass. It's [medically] more detailed than that. It's something Lamar
and I have discussed."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Gentry likes what he's seen of Odom's game during
practice. Gentry can't wait until Odom can play again.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's playing great," he said of Odom, who hasn't played
since going on the injured list Jan. 28. "He's moving great. He
doesn't quite have his basketball legs just yet. But he can still
make plays and is strong defensively. There will be no problem
fitting him in. The guy is an incredibly versatile player."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at San Antonio, 5:30 PST</TE>
<TE>   Site -- SBC Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KXTA (1150).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Clippers 9-13, Spurs 13-9.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Spurs --  (2001-02) 1-3.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- The Spurs did Wednesday what the Clippers failed to do
Tuesday against the Dallas Mavericks, weathering a second-quarter
surge and pulling out a victory. The Clippers wilted against the
Mavericks' 68.8% second-quarter shooting and lost, 122-95. San
Antonio point guard Tony Parker had 32 points, the most in his
career, Wednesday. The Spurs are 47-8 in San Antonio against the
Clippers.</TE>

<LD>How college football writers from around the country feel about the
five candidates for the Heisman Trophy, which will be awarded
Saturday:</LD>
<LD>   BRAD BANKS, IOWA</LD>
<LD>   At His Best in Big Games</LD>
<TE>   If Iowa Coach Kirk Ferentz had a Heisman Trophy vote, it would go
to Hawkeye quarterback Brad Banks.</TE>
<TE>   No surprise there. But Ferentz knows there are a slew of other
qualified candidates. So he urged voters to weigh the impact Banks
made in his first year as a Division I-A starter. A year ago, Iowa
won seven games. With Banks under center, the third-ranked Hawkeyes
went 11-1, won a share of their first Big Ten title since 1990 and
landed in the Orange Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as selling Brad, I can't tell anyone how they should
vote," Ferentz said. "But all I would ask is if anybody is voting, I
would say look at his story."</TE>
<TE>   Banks left his home in South Florida to play in the cornfields
because Iowa was the only major college that promised him a shot at
quarterback. Others pegged him as a wide receiver.</TE>
<TE>   His first Division I-A start came in August. Every Saturday Banks
seemed to improve, with the exception of an erratic second half in a
36-31 loss to intrastate rival Iowa State.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, the best thing I can say is that he played his best in our
biggest games," said Ferentz, noting Banks' clutch performances in
breakthrough road wins at Penn State and Michigan, which both wound
up in New Year's Day bowls.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics also help Banks' cause: He is the top-rated passer in
Division I-A, and he threw only four interceptions, which makes his
coaches adore him.</TE>
<TE>   Banks' main obstacle may be the schedule. The Hawkeyes' last game
was Nov. 16, and since then several of his rivals have had big
performances on national television.</TE>
<TE>   "I would sure hope that, to me, the date of our last game wouldn't
factor into it," Ferentz said. "That's totally irrelevant. What
matters is the way the guys played in their games."</TE>

<TE>   KEN DORSEY, MIAMI</TE>
<TE>   It's Tough to Ignore 38-1</TE>
<TE>   The Heisman Trophy isn't supposed to be about which player will
make the best pro, or about who has put up the gaudiest statistics.</TE>
<TE>   The award is supposed to go to "The Outstanding College Football
Player of the United States," and because it doesn't have a timetable
of how long that player needs to have been outstanding, it has become
sports' foggiest-defined award.</TE>
<TE>   If there was a career award for college football this is it, and
has been for years, which is why many across the country believe that
Miami quarterback Ken Dorsey should win the honor, at least keeping
the pedigree of the award's winners consistent.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey, who has thrown for a career-high 3,073 yards and 26
touchdowns this season, is perceived as the caretaker of the
country's most talented team. But he's more than a caretaker. He's
Miami's driving force, the irreplaceable part that has been the one
constant in an offense that has seen 12 NFL players come and go over
his career as a starter, which just so happens to include a 38-1
record.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that there are guys who can be successful here, but I'd
like to think it's hard to win the number of games we've won here
without having the right guy," Dorsey said.</TE>
<TE>   None of this year's other Heisman candidates have had careers that
come even close to what Dorsey has accomplished throughout his
three-plus seasons as Miami's starter. He holds just about all of the
passing records at Miami and in the Big East, he plays his best in
big games (6-0 against teams ranked in the top 10), and has led Miami
to unparalleled success.</TE>
<TE>   If he wins his second national title in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 3
it's going to be hard to argue that he's not one of college
football's all-time greats at quarterback, alongside the 21 other
quarterbacks who happened to have won the award.</TE>

<TE>   LARRY JOHNSON, PENN ST.</TE>
<TE>   He's at the Head of Class</TE>
<TE>   He has the size, skill, speed and stats. But that isn't why Larry
Johnson should win the Heisman Trophy.</TE>
<TE>   The Penn State running back should win it for his attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're going to hold [something] against me, then I'd rather
not win it," Johnson said. "I can only try so hard. I can only give
100%. If they don't look at that, then don't give me the award."</TE>
<TE>   He's so antithetical to college football, this ornery son of Penn
State's defensive line coach. He waited dutifully -- if impatiently
-- for his chance in Coach Joe Paterno's upperclassmen hierarchy.
Then, as a fifth-year senior, he chased his demons with the nation's
finest rushing season and the best in Penn State history.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson possesses the numbers: 2,015 rushing yards and 2,575
all-purpose yards, both Division I-A highs. His 8.03 yards-per-carry
average is an NCAA record. Among the nine backs with 2,000-yard
rushing seasons, he has the fewest carries (251).</TE>
<TE>   And yet he fights the most negative perception among Heisman
candidates: three "lousy" games against Iowa, Michigan and Ohio
State. Never mind that he averaged 151 all-purpose yards in those
three games. Or that he played against Michigan with a hamstring
injury (but scored the first time he touched the ball).</TE>
<TE>   Dismiss all that and know this: Johnson has scored 29 career
touchdowns without ever doing a dance or Heisman pose. He runs with
anger, passion and class. He represents what the award used to honor.</TE>

<TE>   CARSON PALMER, USC</TE>
<TE>   The Unbiased Choice</TE>
<TE>   Eleven score and six years ago, our founding parents brought forth
upon this Earth a new nation, and after such a chore they felt really
tired, so they stayed put near the Atlantic.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, they realized the land stretched some 3,000 miles to
the west, but most of them had kids, thus no energy left for crossing
two mountain ranges.</TE>
<TE>   And so years after that, Western college football teams lacked for
regard amid an Eastern bias of non-sinister origins. More people
lived in Eastern-Central time zones than in Mountain-Pacific; people
are strange beings who tout nearby athletes; and the East, still
tired from founding the country, often nodded off just as the West
kicked off.</TE>
<TE>   As of 2002, no West Coast player had won the Heisman Trophy since
USC's Marcus Allen in 1981. The West complained of the Eastern bias,
the East complained of the West's complaints about the Eastern bias,
and an exhausting 2002 Heisman race became a prime Eastern-bias test
case.</TE>
<TE>   The most outstanding player of the year lives in Southern
California, where USC had the intestines to schedule Colorado, Kansas
State and Notre Dame atop its conference schedule. So when Carson
Palmer mastered the nation's No. 1 schedule with gaudy numbers such
as 32 touchdown passes and gave Notre Dame's pass defense the worst
passing beating in its history, he molted from mediocrity, redefined
USC as something other than an annual sigh to its lunatic fans, and
bobbed up as the most outstanding player.</TE>
<TE>   But the Carson candidacy lent the prospect of Eastern-bias
grumbles and the fear of hearing again how there's only one voter
region in the West, three in the East.</TE>
<TE>   "I go with the experts because if everyone says it, there must be
something to it," USC Coach Pete Carroll said while recalling no
Eastern bias as coach of the NFL's Patriots and Jets. "I don't have
enough comparison and background to tell you, 'This is the case,'
whether it's because of when our games start or they're not viewed as
much on the East Coast. I think we have the best player in America
here and we'll see what happens."</TE>

<TE>   WILLIS McGAHEE, MIAMI</TE>
<TE>   Making the Most of It</TE>
<TE>   Considering the Heisman Trophy debate generally devolves into a
debate over which player has the better statistics, here's one game's
total that explains why Willis McGahee is the most deserving
candidate:</TE>
<TE>   Ten carries, 60 yards.</TE>
<TE>   That's what he did in the season opener. One carry went 19 yards
for a game-opening touchdown. But the point is the Miami running
back's game was against Florida A&amp;M, when his legs weren't needed to
win. And that should say all you need to know about McGahee's
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   There's no fat on them. None. Against Connecticut, he carried just
11 times for 107 yards (including runs of 15, 15 and 11 for Miami's
first three touchdowns). Against Syracuse, he ran only 14 times for
134 yards (including a 61-yard run for Miami's first touchdown).</TE>
<TE>   McGahee ran for 1,686 quality yards on 262 quality carries for a
6.4-yard quality average and 27 quality touchdowns. He had six
touchdowns in Saturday's regular-season finale against Virginia Tech.
Impressive? Sure. What's more impressive is all were needed for the
win.</TE>
<TE>   While Miami coaches were running a showboat "Heisman Play" for
quarterback Ken Dorsey -- a pass back to Dorsey in the end zone that
backfired when Virginia Tech intercepted -- McGahee was called on
whenever Miami needed simply to win games. And he always delivered,
which is crucial in this year's debate.</TE>
<TE>   He's not only the best player on the best team. He's the fastest
player on the nation's best team -- as well as its strongest player.
No wonder Miami's potent offense revolves around him.</TE>
<TE>   McGahee was the best player in Miami's biggest games too.</TE>
<TE>   Against Florida, his 204 yards were the force Miami won behind.
Against Tennessee, he controlled the clock and the enemy crowd,
gaining 154 yards in 30 carries. Down in the fourth quarter against
Florida State, he turned a simple pass in the flat into a 71-yard
reception that swung the momentum and set up the crucial score.</TE>
<TE>   Listen, the Heisman is a hair-splitting campaign among the creme
de la college this year. Carson Palmer had a bad game at Kansas State
-- completing 18 of 46 passes. USC lost.</TE>
<TE>   If McGahee has a similarly bad game against a quality opponent,
Miami would have lost too. But McGahee didn't.</TE>
<TE>   There's no padding in McGahee. Just a body of work -- on the best
team's fastest and strongest body -- that shows why he's the
country's outstanding player.</TE>

<LD>The Laker locker room could be thawing.</LD>
<LD>   According to one player, Kobe Bryant shouted, "See you tomorrow,
fellas!" on his way out the door Thursday afternoon, which is better
than the dull silence they'd been getting from Bryant and Shaquille
O'Neal lately.</LD>
<LD>   These are not particularly cheery days around the Lakers, not
after their leaders began casting blame, causing the veteran role
players to go just as public in order to defend themselves. Not since
O'Neal and Bryant were taking swats at each other two years ago have
Laker practice days teemed with such intrigue.</LD>
<TE>   Brian Shaw, who at 36 is too old and has been around too long to
take such abuse, said Thursday he had a deal for the Laker
superstars.</TE>
<TE>   "The other 11 guys, we're getting our 30 points a game," Shaw
said. "It's up to them to get their 70."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Shaw said, laughing, it's not as grim as when Bryant
froze them all out about a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   "They're just quiet, reserved," he said. "You know when Shaq's
quiet and reserved, something's wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Forty-five minutes after, O'Neal strolled past reporters in an
emptying parking lot and was dismissive again.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't wait for me after practice," he said. "I ain't got nothing
to say."</TE>
<TE>   Said Shaw: "I guess we're just like you; we're on the outs with
them too."</TE>
<TE>   Many around the Lakers assume harmony will return with victory,
and that the sudden character flaws are little more than human
nature, absorbed easily by a good week or two.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's a team divided," Shaw said. "I think it's a
team frustrated."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Horace Grant left Orlando on Wednesday bound for Los Angeles,
where he was expected to meet today with ... his fiancee's mother.</TE>
<TE>   It's her birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Grant, released Wednesday by the Magic, told the Orlando Sentinel
on Thursday that he expected to hear from Laker General Manager Mitch
Kupchak, but that he also fully expected to retire.</TE>
<TE>   Grant, 37, had left knee surgery in September and played in five
games in his second stint with the Magic. He averaged 5.2 points and
1.6 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson, who coached Grant in Chicago and Los Angeles,
wavered on the subject of adding Grant to back up O'Neal, but in the
end said, "What aren't you supposed to do to a gift horse?"</TE>
<TE>   That would be a gift Horace.</TE>
<TE>   "At this time we're not going to discount anything," Kupchak said.</TE>
<TE>   If the Lakers were to sign him, it would be for the veterans'
minimum of $1 million, prorated for his time with the club.</TE>

<DH>While making the latest of his famous comebacks (and saving
hockey in Pittsburgh), Lemieux finds time to lead the NHL in scoring
at 37.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Santa Claus is coming to town ...</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Springsteen's voice blared from the dressing room, somewhat
prophetic.</LD>
<LD>   A small cache of sports memorabilia, after all, was already signed
and sealed, waiting to be collected. If it can be linked to hockey or
has his image, Mario Lemieux has most likely signed it.</LD>
<TE>   Lemieux emerged from the dressing room as Springsteen's voice
faded. Dressed in a suit, he was ready for his first-day-in-town
ritual.</TE>
<TE>   The Pittsburgh Penguins were on the ice already, going through
their morning skate, preparing for Thursday night's game against the
San Jose Sharks. Their player/owner cheerfully braced for another day
of the same old, same old.</TE>
<TE>   Each stop on the road includes an informal news conference. The
same questions bring the same answers, delivered with an easy manner
missing during his younger days.</TE>
<TE>   His presence in town is an event. If the town is in Canada, it's
the main event. He gives the right answers in the morning, then puts
on a hockey clinic in the evening.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I don't have too many years left, so I'm enjoying the game
more than I did before, practicing and playing the games, just having
fun," he said. "Once it's gone, it's gone. So you have to enjoy while
it's there."</TE>
<TE>   It has been gone before, yet he keeps recapturing his place. Back
surgeries, Hodgkin's disease, self-imposed retirement, a hip injury,
all took him from the game, but he keeps coming back.</TE>
<TE>   His reason is simple: love of the game.</TE>
<TE>   The speculation is a bit more complicated: a new arena for
Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Those reasons mean little to fans, who watch him in awe, or
opponents, who seem to have a difficult time keeping an eye on him.</TE>
<TE>   At 37, Lemieux is immersed in another amazing-but-true comeback,
this time from hip problems. He leads the NHL with 53 points, having
scored at least one point in 12 consecutive games, including two
goals in a 5-2 loss to the Sharks.</TE>
<TE>   "I have yet to see a coach or team completely neutralize him," San
Jose Coach Ron Wilson said before Thursday's game. "If something
worked, he wouldn't have 51 points right now. All you can do is work
to minimize the damage."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings and the Ducks take on damage control this weekend, when
Pittsburgh comes to town for two games, Lemieux's first in Southern
California since December of 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a long time ago, wasn't it?" Lemieux said. "I don't
remember much."</TE>
<TE>   What's to remember? A goal and assist against the Kings, two goals
and an assist against the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Same old, same old.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux keeps readjusting his place in history, and there are not
many places left above him.</TE>
<TE>   The Great One is soaking up the retirement rays down in Arizona.
Lemieux has tried that and returned to the freezing comfort of the
hockey rink. Wayne Gretzky will take his greatest-ever into
immortality. Lemieux, however, might be second to none.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly there is no comparison between the 37-year-old Lemieux
and Gretzky at the same age. By then Gretzky was living on legend.
Lemieux, now, is a living legend.</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux has 16 goals this season, giving him 670, seventh
all-time. His 1,654 points also rank him seventh. Gretzky is tops
with 894 goals and 1,963 assists.</TE>
<TE>   "I think nobody is surprised about him anymore," Penguin Alexei
Kovalev said. "Mario has been the best player all his life. It's not
surprising he has shown that again. He's 37 years old and he has had
a lot of injuries. But skill is something you never lose. You might
lose speed, physics, but the one thing you never lose is talent."</TE>
<TE>   The crackdown on obstruction has certainly helped. Lemieux and the
NHL's other free skaters can again build up speed through the neutral
zone, descend and attack.</TE>
<TE>   "The game isn't as tough on older guys as it has been the last few
years," Lemieux said. "Now there is a little bit more flow to the
game. There's more skating, more moving the puck. The give and go is
back in the game, which is nice to see, I think you're going to see a
few careers extended a little because of that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All the goals and assists and trophies mean little to Lemieux
compared to the Penguins as a franchise.</TE>
<TE>   He rescued them from bankruptcy in 1999 by putting together a
group of investors and kept the team in Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   "No one could have done this but Mario Lemieux," NHL Commissioner
Gary Bettman said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Time for another miracle on ice.</TE>
<TE>   The Penguins' Mellon Arena is a quaint Igloo-shaped landmark that
has been known to leak water onto fans. New stadiums were erupting
all over Pittsburgh in recent years. The Steelers and Pirates have
them. The Penguins patiently await their turn.</TE>
<TE>   The state has agreed to chip in $90 million, although it still
must be approved by the governor. Lemieux has already bought the
land. All that is needed is another $53 million, which team officials
hope will come from local taxes. That seems far-fetched at the
moment.</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux hopes a deal can be made in January or February, but
denies that he continues to play to drum up support for an arena.</TE>
<TE>   "The new arena is going to be there whether I play or not," said
Lemieux, who has a three-man committee that handles most of the
team's to day-to-day operations while he plays. "So that's not an
issue."</TE>
<TE>   Others see it as a big issue. In fact, one hockey official said
that Lemieux's presence on the ice would be the key issue.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nearly everyone thought the end had finally come last March, when
a hip injury ended Lemieux's season after only 24 games.</TE>
<TE>   His career path is strewn with roadblocks ... all in the rearview
mirror.</TE>
<TE>   He sat out 50 games in 1990-91 while recovering from back surgery.
He finished tops in playoff scoring with 44 points and won his third
scoring title the following season.</TE>
<TE>   He was diagnosed with a form of Hodgkin's in 1992-93 and sat out a
month to undergo radiation treatments. He returned after a month and
won the scoring title.</TE>
<TE>   He sat out recovering from more back surgery in 1994-95. He won
the scoring title the following season, and again in 1996-97.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, last season, the timing seemed right for him to bow out. He
had just won the gold medal playing for Canada in the Olympics. That
was the perfect last achievement in a career that includes two
Stanley Cups, three Hart Trophies for most valuable player, two Conn
Smythe Trophies for the most valuable player in the playoffs and six
scoring titles.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no doubt I was coming back this year," Lemieux said. "I
knew what I had last year was unfortunate. I hurt my hip in training
camp and never recovered from there. I spent a lot of time this
summer working out, making sure that I was ready for this year."</TE>
<TE>   He was.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have 50 highlight goals, Mario will be there 30 times,"
San Jose's Teemu Selanne said. "My rookie year, when they announced
he had Hodgkin's I remember he was 30 points behind Patrick
LaFontaine, Mario said that he was coming back and winning the
scoring title. He came and did it. I felt then that this guy was
Superman."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How much longer Lemieux will carry on is to be seen. He has quit
before, but couldn't make it stick.</TE>
<TE>   "My family was a big reason I came back," Lemieux said. "My son
loves to play hockey. I figured it wasn't too late for me to come and
enjoy the game together. I got tired of playing golf and doing the
same thing every day."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Lemieux chose to do a different same thing every day ...
at least when he's on the road. The interviews and autographs during
the day. The goals and assists at night.</TE>
<TE>   Said Lemieux: "I'm going to keep playing as long as I'm healthy
and having fun and playing at a high level."</TE>
<TE>   If that's the criteria, then Santa Claus could be coming to town
for a long, long time.</TE>

<DH>McGee has been tested by bitter custody fight, cancer, rift
with twin sister, even prison, but says her spirit is unbroken</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maryann Hudson Harvey</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Pamela McGee spent two days dressed down in an orange jumpsuit in a
jail cell in Sacramento. There was no Nike swoosh on this outfit.</LD>
<LD>   It was January 1998, years removed from when Pamela and twin
sister Paula helped USC win the 1983 and '84 national championships
in women's basketball.</LD>
<LD>   Her private block in the civil section was across the hallway from
a conglomeration of alleged criminal offenders. They recognized her
as she was brought in -- she was a star player for the Sacramento
Monarchs of the WNBA -- and, after an initial ruckus of "Pamela
McGee, what are you doing here?" McGee, nervous, started to sing.</LD>
<TE>   It was a spiritual song, taken from a Bible verse. "No weapon
formed against me shall prosper," McGee began, and the jail quieted.</TE>
<TE>   "Then they all started standing up and taking turns testifying,"
McGee said. "It was like church. One woman stood up and said, 'God
woke me up and told me he was going to set me free.' And another one
said, 'The Lord spoke to me last night and told me that I was going
back to jail, but I'm going back with the Word.' It was something."</TE>
<TE>   McGee was jailed during a Sacramento Superior Court hearing
because, mired in a child custody battle with her ex-husband, the
Rev. Kevin Stafford, she refused to tell the judge the location of
her then 3-year-old daughter, Imani. McGee had taken Imani out of
Michigan, where the couple had married and later divorced in 1996,
without court permission. When the 1997 WNBA season ended, Stafford
expected McGee to return Imani to Michigan, and when McGee didn't,
Stafford went to court.</TE>
<TE>   What ensued was a very public, biting saga of twists and turns,
including allegations of sexual abuse on both sides. After two nights
in jail, McGee turned Imani over to the judge, and she has never
regained custody. She still has no legal visitation schedule.</TE>
<TE>   McGee retired from the WNBA in May 1999, and later returned to
Michigan to be close to Imani. Then, in a twist, Stafford apparently
moved Imani to Los Angeles without the court's permission. According
to a review of court records, transcripts and information supplied by
a Macomb County, Mich., Circuit Court spokesperson, Stafford did not
have permission to move Imani out of state. Stafford and his lawyer,
Peter Lucido of Michigan, declined comment, citing a gag order on the
case dating to 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in the midst of the mire, the strong bond that had always
linked Pamela and Paula was temporarily lost. Pamela thought Paula
took the other side when she reiterated to an investigator a sexual
abuse allegation against a member of McGee's family.</TE>
<TE>   For the family, the divide was unthinkable.</TE>
<TE>   The twins' lives, their sister Alayna Gilbert says, had always
been entwined. Even before their dad, Jimmie Jr., nailed a hoop above
the garage on Esther Street. Even in third grade, when they were so
awful at basketball their coach would offer them to opposing teams
who didn't have enough players, saying, 'Here, take the twins,' and
the girls were so tall the duped coach would do so.</TE>
<TE>   When they were 9, they had a shoe size to match. At 18, they were
6 feet 2 and were among the best basketball players in the country.
They led Flint Northern High to a 75-0 record and two Michigan state
titles, and had their choice of colleges. Together they chose USC,
and made history.</TE>
<TE>   Playing in a frontcourt with Cheryl Miller, and with a backcourt
that included Cynthia Cooper and Rhonda Windham, the twins were an
integral part of a team that won USC's only basketball national
championships.</TE>
<TE>   When we last left them, Pam was giving Paula her gold medal after
winning the 1984 Olympic basketball championship in Los Angeles. Pam
found Paula -- who didn't make the Olympic team -- in the crowd at
the Forum and ran to her. "This medal's for you too," Pam told her.
They cried. Together.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night, USC will honor the '83 and '84 championship teams
during halftime of its game at the Forum, and Pamela and Paula, now
40, will stand together again.</TE>
<TE>   Their feud was a huge blow to a family already struggling with
life's injustices. Last year, their mother, Dianne McGee, 58, had a
life-impairing stroke. She is the matriarch of the family, its
strength, having raised four children alone after her husband drowned
in a boating accident when the twins were 15.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Pamela was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was
caught early and, so far, having weathered a mastectomy, removal of
her lymph nodes and reconstructive surgery, has won that fight. She
also looks strong; her hair is long and shiny, her build, athletic.</TE>
<TE>   "My family has known some grief," Alayna said. "[Pamela] has had
to fight for so many things in her life, some unjust things, where
one battle comes after another, and I admire her courage.</TE>
<TE>   "She doesn't always fight a good fight, or the best way, but she
does the best she can. And no matter who knocks her down or what
comes her way she's never going be a woman who says, 'OK, I give up,
I quit.' "</TE>
<TE>   McGee, up again, says she's ready to resume the fight for custody
of Imani, now 8: "Maybe because I had a strong mother, and because of
my athletic career, I just realize I may be down for the count, but
I'll be back. I just needed time to regroup. But never did I give up.
There is a time of the season for everything.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't make this a pity-party story."</TE>
<TE>   The Case</TE>
<TE>   The reason McGee harbored Imani, according to her declaration
filed Jan. 9, 1998 in Sacramento Superior Court, was concern that
Imani "has been molested by her paternal grandfather, E.E. Stafford."</TE>
<TE>   E.E. Stafford, pastor of Mt. Tabor Baptist Church in L.A., has
denied the allegations. But it wasn't until a Sacramento Superior
Court judge signed a temporary restraining order preventing E.E.
Stafford from having any contact with Imani, and enjoined Kevin
Stafford to comply, that McGee turned Imani over to authorities and
was released from jail.</TE>
<TE>   McGee's custody issue gained national attention in 1998 when Kevin
Stafford and his lawyer, Peter Lucido, argued that McGee's WNBA
career impaired her ability to be a good parent. Stafford dropped
that argument after the comments caused an outcry from those
concerned with the rights of a single parent. In the media blitz that
followed, Judge Peter J. Maceroni of the Macomb County Court in Mt.
Clemens, Mich., placed a gag order barring those involved from
talking about the case. He then assigned the matter to the Michigan
Friend of the Court to investigate and provide a recommendation.</TE>
<TE>   The court investigation took nearly a year. Stafford was awarded
physical custody with both parents sharing joint custody. The ruling
had nothing to do with McGee's WNBA career. It stated that both
parents were fit, but sided with Stafford because Imani had
established a home with him before and while the court was sorting
everything out.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in the summer of 2000, despite McGee's objections in court,
Stafford moved Imani to L.A., where he became assistant pastor at his
father's church and still works. Imani has lived in L.A. for the last
two years, according to McGee and family members.</TE>
<TE>   McGee's allegations of sexual abuse against E.E. Stafford were
investigated and substantiated by a California protective services
agency, but he was not prosecuted, according to a report filed on
June 15, 1999 by the Friend of the Court Office in Macomb County. The
investigator, who gave no reason why E.E. Stafford was not
prosecuted, said she believed there was some sexual abuse committed
by somebody against the child, but found it difficult to prove.</TE>
<TE>   E.E. Stafford sought a restraining order against McGee and sued
her for slander, but later dropped the suit. "I can tell you that
there is no truth to it," he said in a telephone interview. "I had
control of my son and Pam used that to try and persuade him to listen
to her instead of being obedient to me."</TE>
<TE>   E.E. Stafford said he was not investigated by a California child
protective agency and did not know there was a report in the public
file in Michigan. He had no further comment on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The Friend of the Court report also addressed an anonymous
complaint investigated by the Michigan Children's Protective Services
in March 1997. The complaint alleged that Imani had suffered physical
and sexual abuse from a member of McGee's side of the family. The
report stated the Michigan agency could find "no credible evidence"
to these charges, and found them "unsubstantiated." The report stated
that Imani, then 2, had told these allegations to a day-care worker
and to a maternal aunt.</TE>
<TE>   Paula McGee confirmed she was the maternal aunt. If the
allegations were true, Paula said, she wanted everyone to get help.
This, she said, is what caused the rift between her and her sister.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew everything that was going on both sides, and I thought it
was at the expense of my niece and nephew, so I wasn't on anybody's
side," Paula said. "In the beginning, I talked with Pam about it, but
later, she thought I wasn't supporting her. This was the beginning of
our down time. Like, time out. It's not permanent."</TE>
<TE>   Pamela said she is no longer angry with Paula, but confirmed this
was the reason she and Paula's relationship had struggled.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a betrayal," Pamela said.</TE>
<TE>   Legacy of Strength</TE>
<TE>   In August, Pamela started life anew at Chicago State University as
a women's basketball assistant coach. She made the move to Chicago
from Flint, where she had been coaching boys' basketball. Then, in
October, she accepted the position of assistant coach for the Detroit
Shock of the WNBA, and moved back to Michigan. That placed her closer
to the courthouse, where she plans to resume legal pursuit for
custody of Imani, and closer to her mother, who is in a nursing home
in Flint.</TE>
<TE>   The family says Dianne McGee's condition is improving, and her
spirit is better, but she is paralyzed on her right side and has
trouble speaking. The family plans to move her to a home close to
daughter Alayna, who lives in Chino Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Pamela is a single mom to 14-year-old son JaVale, who already
wears a size 17 shoe and, at 6-2 (the doctor said he will be 7 feet),
looks mom square in the eye. He gets good grades, and plays
basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "When you affect a woman as a mother there's no deeper pain,"
McGee said. "Jesus died, was crucified, they threw spears at him,
tried to hurt him, he went to hell and back, but ultimately, he
resurrected. Some people stay on the cross, they say, 'Woe is me,
this and that,' but I chose to resurrect out of the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "For my son and for my daughter, when it's all said and done,
they'll say my mother was a strong woman. If she can do it, I can do
it."</TE>
<TE>   McGee says she sees Imani rarely, and talks with her on the phone
only once in a while. Alayna keeps in close touch with Imani. This
summer, Alayna says, Imani asked her why she didn't take her mom's
side during the trials. Then she asked her why she didn't take her
dad's side.</TE>
<TE>   Alayna told Imani: " 'Here's what I did, I chose to stay neutral,
and I chose to spend time with you. That's how I supported your mom,
by taking care of you. Because sometimes when adults fight, Imani,
you just have to stay out of it.'</TE>
<TE>   "And Imani looks at me and says, 'Well, you know when I get older
I'm going to go read the court papers.' "</TE>

<HD>More Wheeling Than Dealing?</HD>
<DH>Baseball's winter meetings open in Nashville, but Dodgers
and Angels aren't expected to do much.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Often resembling an expensive, nonstop swap meet, baseball's annual
winter convention opens at Nashville's Opryland Hotel today, the
market more resembling the melancholy pace of a country ballad.</LD>
<LD>   Whether the clubs will continue to operate cautiously under the
new labor agreement or respond to four days of lobby and closed-door
mingling with a flurry of trades and signings isn't certain, but
there is no deadline attached to the meetings. It is safe to say that
neither the Angels nor Dodgers sense an urgency to complete their
winter business before leaving Nashville on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels, of course, have it comparatively easy.</LD>
<TE>   Thanks to Disney's payroll generosity, their World Series winning
roster will be virtually unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Bill Stoneman is basically looking to replace only
reserve outfielders Orlando Palmeiro and Alex Ochoa.</TE>
<TE>   A veteran of the Todd Hollandsworth, John Mabry or John Vander Wal
caliber could fit one of those spots, and Stoneman might let
farmhands Jeff DaVanon, Robb Quinlan, Barry Wesson and Nathan Haynes
vie for the other.</TE>
<TE>   Although left-handed reliever Scott Schoeneweis has asked to be
traded, so that he can return to a starting rotation, Stoneman is
unwilling to grant that request.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, what is best for the Angels and what is best for
Scott's career are not in unison," agent Scott Boras conceded.</TE>
<TE>   All of that, however, does not mean Stoneman will take his phone
off the hook in Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is a scenario that seems better suited for next
winter, the expanded payroll might influence Stoneman to pursue a
starting outfielder, not offer a contract to designated hitter Brad
Fullmer, who would prefer to start regularly than platoon with Shawn
Wooten, and use right fielder Tim Salmon as the DH. Said Stoneman,
without specifically addressing that scenario, "At some point down
the road, Tim will be a DH more than he has."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, having created considerable roster and some financial
flexibility with the trade that sent Eric Karros and Mark
Grudzielanek to the Chicago Cubs, are still looking to fill their
left-handed relief void and now must acquire a first baseman to
replace Karros or an outfielder to replace Shawn Green, if the
Dodgers take their right fielder up on his offer to move to first.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to Nashville thinking we have to leave with a
finished product, but we will find out what some of our choices are,"
General Manager Dan Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   "A week ago we didn't know if we had a chance [to move Karros and
Grudzielanek], so we're still in the preliminary stages of revisiting
clubs and exploring our options. I'd be lying if I said we had a
definitive route."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers would prefer to keep Green in the outfield but are
determined to remain under the $117-million payroll tax threshold,
which would seem to eliminate a free-agent hitter of Jeff Kent or
Cliff Floyd's magnitude, and means Evans probably has about $5
million to spend on both a hitter and left-handed reliever.</TE>
<TE>   Evans wouldn't discuss specific players, but among first basemen
thought to be available in trade are Kevin Young, Sean Casey, Travis
Lee, Derrick Lee, Raul Ibanez (primary an outfielder) and Erubiel
Durazo.</TE>
<TE>   Fred McGriff, who hit 30 home runs and drove in 103 runs for the
Cubs, is an intriguing proposition as a free agent, given that he is
39 and might be willing to sign a one-year contract for a
comparatively modest salary, enhancing the Dodgers' flexibility in
2004.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, of course, are not alone in taking a conservative
approach. The market was expected to undergo a correction in the
first winter of a more restrictive labor agreement, and it has. Part
of that is the agreement, part the overall economy. There have been
only two major signings -- Jim Thome received a six-year, $85-million
contract from the Philadelphia Phillies, and Tom Glavine received a
three-year, $35-million contract from the New York Mets -- and both
would have been even larger in previous winters.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Kent, Floyd and McGriff, among still unsigned -- and
largely unpursued -- free agents are Greg Maddux, Roger Clemens,
Edgardo Alfonzo, Ivan Rodriguez and Reggie Sanders.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the free-agent class is expected to grow Dec. 20,
when many familiar players are not tendered 2003 contracts by their
current clubs, perhaps enhancing the pickings for patient general
managers such as Evans.</TE>
<TE>   That is one reason for thinking this year's convention might not
produce the usual number of trades. Another is that many clubs will
be lined up at Omar Minaya's door, holding off on any other move to
first see if they can do business with the Montreal Expos' general
manager, whose list of available players could include Bartolo Colon,
Jose Vidro, Javier Vazquez, Tony Armas Jr., and even Vladimir
Guerrero. It is estimated that Minaya will need a payroll of $60
million-plus to keep the Expos together, but it is thought that the
other 29 clubs, which continue to subsidize Minaya's virtually
homeless team, have authorized a payroll of only about $45 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Montreal will have such a say in what happens this
weekend that everything is pretty much at the Expos' disposal,"
Toronto Blue Jay General Manager J.P. Ricciardi said.</TE>
<TE>   "So many teams have put everything on hold, wanting to see where
they fit with them."</TE>

<HD>Wesley Leads Hornets, 93-88</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New Orleans Hornets opened a seven-game trip in style. David
Wesley was eight of 10 from three-point range and scored 33 points in
a 93-88 victory Thursday night over the Utah Jazz at Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   "They kept going in, so I kept shooting them," Wesley said. "It
felt good because I was tired and had a splitting headache. But when
shots are falling you feel good."</LD>
<LD>   The Jazz had a chance to tie the score at 88 with about 10 seconds
to go. But Karl Malone's jump shot bounced off the rim and the
rebound kicked out to Baron Davis, who drove for a layup and was
fouled with 6.1 seconds left.</LD>
<TE>   The Hornets made only one of their first 10 shots and went
scoreless for 4:42 in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 113, Atlanta 95 -- Kevin Garnett had 21 points, nine
assists and eight rebounds at Minneapolis and the Timberwolves
continued their mastery of the Hawks.</TE>
<TE>   Rasho Nesterovic had 18 points and six rebounds, Troy Hudson added
18 points and Joe Smith 15 points for the Timberwolves. They've
beaten the Hawks seven straight times.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta lost its sixth straight road game, and is 2-10 away from
home this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Hawks had a 10-point lead midway through the first quarter,
but soft defense prevented them from keeping it. They've allowed 100
or more points in eight of 12 games on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 86, Chicago 76 -- Chauncey Billups had a season-high 21
points, including a big three-pointer with about a minute left at
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Hamilton added 20 for the Pistons, who got double figures
in either points or rebounds from four of their starters. After
losing three straight, the Pistons have won two in a row.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Weir had an eagle and five birdies, and teamed up with
right-hander Ian Leggatt to shoot a 13-under-par 59 Thursday as
Canada took the lead in the World Cup of Golf at Puerto Vallarta,
Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   Much of the focus going into the tournament was on the top-seeded
American team of Phil Mickelson and David Toms, but it was Weir and
Leggatt who led after the opening round.</LD>
<LD>   Mickelson and Toms struggled with their putting most of the day
and shot 65. The Americans, who made only one birdie in the first
five holes, are tied for 16th, six shots behind.</LD>
<TE>   Mickelson couldn't shake his recent slump. He drove the ball into
fairway bunkers, missed short birdie putts and had to hit his second
shot on the par-four 18th from his knees after his drive ended up in
the hazard that splits the fairway and runs along the left side of
the hole.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson didn't get a birdie until No. 6, where his 15-foot putt
caught the right side of the hole, rolled around and went in.</TE>
<TE>   Australia's team of Craig Parry and Adam Scott was second with at
60.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea was tied with France at 11 under, and defending
champion South Africa and Sweden were 10 under.</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE NFL</KH>
<HD>Rams' Warner Officially Out for Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The St. Louis Rams put quarterback Kurt Warner on injured reserve
Thursday because of his broken right hand, meaning he won't play
again this season.</LD>
<LD>   The move came a day after Coach Mike Martz suggested there will be
an open quarterback competition next year if former third-stringer
Marc Bulger, who led the Rams to five consecutive victories earlier
in the season, picks up where he left off.</LD>
<LD>   Warner, the NFL's most valuable player two of the last three
seasons, admitted he was taken aback by Martz's comments. The coach
has steadfastly been in Warner's corner all season, accusing those of
backing Bulger after Warner recovered from a broken pinkie of being
part of the "amnesia crowd."</LD>
<TE>   "Yeah, it would surprise you just because he's always been my
biggest advocate and I think he knows what I'm capable of doing,"
Warner said. "I think probably the issue here more than anything is
Kurt getting 100%, and when he's 100%, then we go from there."</TE>
<TE>   Martz said he waited until Bulger got medical clearance to play to
put Warner on injured reserve.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two distractions hit the New York Jets on Thursday: an
investigation into an assault of a limousine driver, then fights at
practice.</TE>
<TE>   The day began with rampant speculation about which member of the
offensive line is being accused of assaulting a Long Island limo
driver Monday outside an East Norwich, N.Y., steakhouse. Nassau
County police said the case is under investigation and that Jet
management has been contacted.</TE>
<TE>   "We do have some interviews scheduled," said Nassau County Det.
Lt. Steven Skrynecki. "We do plan to be interviewing several members
of the Jets' organization."</TE>
<TE>   The driver, Donald Matinsky, sustained a broken kneecap after
allegedly being thrown to the ground by a man believed to be a Jet
offensive lineman.</TE>
<TE>   As if that wasn't enough distraction as the Jets (7-6) prepare for
a road game Sunday against the Chicago Bears, Coach Herman Edwards
stopped practice after three fights broke out.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope we play like that Sunday," Edwards said. "I told them to
save all that for Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Viking wide receiver Randy Moss avoided jail time and a minor drug
charge with a plea bargain at Minneapolis, resolving accusations that
he had bumped a traffic safety officer with his car.</TE>
<TE>   Hennepin County District Judge Mark Wernick fined Moss $1,200.
Wernick also sentenced Moss to 30 days in jail but gave him two days'
credit for the time he already served, and stayed the rest as long as
Moss doesn't commit any similar careless driving offenses.</TE>

<TE>   New York Giant receiver Ron Dixon had surgery on his right knee, a

<HD>Injured Yagudin Has His Eye on the Cash</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alexei Yagudin has never been reluctant to say what he thinks. But
organizers of tonight's Crest Whitestrips International Figure
Skating Challenge must have cringed when the Olympic gold medalist
said he was too injured to skate his best but would show up, anyway,
for the money.</LD>
<LD>   Yagudin won the Sears Open last week in Red Deer, Canada, a minor
miracle because of a hip problem that has caused the cartilage to
wear away. He reportedly limped when he walked but skated well enough
to earn four perfect scores of 6.0 and land difficult triple-triple
jump combinations.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, he told Canada's Globe and Mail he wouldn't be matching
that this weekend.</LD>
<TE>   "I can easily say what my place is going to be there," he said.
"I'm not even going to try. I can't do that right now. I can't pull
everything from me."</TE>
<TE>   He's reluctant to have surgery because, he said, it's not certain
an operation would alleviate his pain, and he fears the injury will
curtail his career.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I decided to go to these events," he said. "It's my
job. It's how I get my salary and I will need that in the future.
Maybe I will not be able to skate in a few years."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's event, at the Palace of Auburn Hills in Michigan, is
backed by the U.S. Figure Skating Assn., sanctioned by the
International Skating Union, and is for Olympic-eligible skaters.</TE>
<TE>   The men's field also includes Takeshi Honda, Olympic silver
medalist Evgeny Plushenko, Olympic bronze medalist Tim Goebel, Matt
Savoie and Michael Weiss. Goebel, who trains in El Segundo, has
missed most of the season because of a hip problem.</TE>
<TE>   The women's field is led by Olympic gold medalist Sarah Hughes,
competing for the first time since a torn leg muscle kept her out of
the Grand Prix series. She will compete against Olympic silver
medalist and world champion Irina Slutskaya; Sasha Cohen, Viktoria
Volchkova, Jennifer Kirk and Ann Patrice McDonough.</TE>
<TE>   The Hallmark Skaters' championship, to be held Saturday in
Columbus, Ohio, features Olympic pairs co-gold medalists Jamie Sale
and David Pelletier.</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin is scheduled to compete Saturday too. Also entered are
Honda, six-time U.S. champion Todd Eldredge and two-time U.S.
champion Weiss. Hughes, Slutskaya, Maria Butyrskaya and Yuka Sato
will compete for the women's prize. Sale and Pelletier, who won the
Sears Open, will compete with Olympic bronze medalists Xue Shen and
Hongbo Zhao; Sato and Jason Dungjen, and Qing Pang and Jian Tong.</TE>
<TE>   All Very Grand</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Kwan wasn't expecting to qualify for the Grand Prix Final
after competing in -- and winning -- one event, Skate America.
However, a series of surprises among the top women gave the Torrance
native the sixth and last berth in the Grand Prix Final, Feb.
28-March 3 in St. Petersburg, Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan had planned to reduce her schedule this season but stepped in
on short notice at Skate America when Hughes withdrew. Kwan and Cohen
are the only U.S. skaters who qualified for the Grand Prix Final.</TE>
<TE>   "Making the final came as a surprise to her," said Kwan's agent,
Shep Goldberg.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something she may well do, but she's not going to think
about it until after nationals."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Figure Skating Assn. spokesman Bob Dunlop said he expected
Kwan to delay a decision until after the U.S. championships, Jan.
12-19 in Dallas. If she were to opt out of the Grand Prix Final,
"certainly we would not hold it against her," Dunlop said. "We'll
cross that bridge when we come to it."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg confirmed that Kwan planned to compete in the U.S.
championships, whose top three finishers will qualify for the world
championships, March 24-30 in Washington. He also said she still was
working with Coach Scott Williams, whom she hired a few months ago,
and had consulted Nikolai Morozov on refining her programs.</TE>
<TE>   All Downhill From Here</TE>
<TE>   U.S. ski officials were ecstatic over their athletes' success last
weekend, which included eight top-three finishes and 10 top-10
finishes in ski and snowboard events. Three U.S. men finished in the
top 10 at a World Cup downhill race at Beaver Creek, Colo., the first
such success for the men since 1972.</TE>
<TE>   "This is absolutely what we're looking for," said Alan Ashley,
vice president of athletics for the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Assn.
"It's a signal we're on the right track."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Alpine team is third behind Austria and Switzerland for
the Nations Cup, which encompasses all Alpine events.</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   The City of Los Angeles marathon next year will be the first major
marathon to offer runners personalized bibs. Participants who
register before Dec. 30 will have their first names on their bibs,
which might not help them run faster but gives spectators a rooting
interest. Details: www.lamarathon.com.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. women's water polo team reached the semifinals of the
World Cup tournament with an 8-3 victory over Australia at Perth,
winning its group title at 2-0-1. Brenda Villa of Commerce scored
four goals in an 11-1 rout of Kazakhstan in the second game, even
though she missed the morning practice to complete two finals for her
courses at Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   The Junior Grand Prix Final figure skating competition starts
today in the Netherlands. Beatrisa Liang of Granada Hills and the
pair of Tiffany and Johnnie Stiegler of Manhattan Beach are among the
entrants. A third testing of the proposed cumulative scoring system
will be run concurrently with the existing system.</TE>

<LD>One day next week, needy families and individuals who have come to
appreciate the generous assistance of the staff and volunteers at the
House of Yahwhew in Lawndale will be getting a hot meal often
requested but rarely served.</LD>
<LD>   They'll be eating freshly caught fish, prepared by one of several
chefs who donate their time at the facility.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's wonderful because everybody deserves to have
something different once in a while," said administrator Constanza
Prada, adding that the facility typically serves 150-200 meals daily,
six days a week. "We give them beef and other food and sometimes they
ask for fish but we don't have it. They'll be very happy to be
getting fish."</LD>
<TE>   Not far away, at the Long Beach Rescue Mission, the catch of the
day will also be featured.</TE>
<TE>   "And it will be a nice change of pace for them to have that," said
Bill Thomas, president of the organization. "I imagine they'll have
it baked or fried. We have a great cook, Fred Sigrist, so I'll leave
that up to him."</TE>
<TE>   These are two of three local charities that stand to benefit from
the inaugural "Fish for the Homeless Day," which is scheduled Tuesday
between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. The other is the Beacon House Assn. of San
Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   The event was organized by Philip Friedman of 976tuna.com and
involves seven sportfishing landings and perhaps several hundred
private anglers using their own vessels.</TE>
<TE>   "Why? Because this is a great time of the year to help the poor
and come together as fishermen to do something positive for the
community," said Friedman, who also runs a youth fishing program that
treats 3,000-5,000 underprivileged children each year to a day on the
water.</TE>
<TE>   Anglers have gotten behind the latest effort, Friedman says, in an
attempt to show that "they're human beings who do a lot of good in
the communities." Such a statement speaks volumes, considering that
fishermen, in the last year or so, have been portrayed by some
environmental groups as reckless fish killers who do more damage than
good.</TE>
<TE>   The environmental groups, in their push for and support of recent
and proposed closures designed largely to protect rockfish, have
alienated sport fishermen by making them appear as though they care
nothing about the resource, when in fact, the fishermen have argued,
the opposite is true.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the true spirit of fishermen coming through at the right
time," said Bob Fletcher, president of the Sportfishing Assn. of
California. "I think it's a beautiful gesture on the part of
fishermen and I hope it continues year after year."</TE>
<TE>   The landings offering free trips for the cause: Marina del Rey
Sportfishing, Redondo Sportfishing, 22nd St. Landing in San Pedro,
Pierpoint Landing in Long Beach, Long Beach Sportfishing, L.A. Harbor
Sportfishing and Davey's Locker in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Private boaters wishing to participate should drop off their catch
by 2 p.m. at the designated landings. Target species include sand
dabs, bass and halibut. The fish will be cleaned by volunteers at the
landings. Details: (310) 328-5850.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen aren't the most notable humanitarians, but some try.
Fletcher, as a prominent member of the San Diego Rotary Club, started
a cooperative program nine years ago called Fish Across the Border,
which once a year delivers food packages to the poorer families in
and around Ensenada.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 11, he and the Ensenada Rotarians, with help from other
Rotary Club members, and with fish donated by anglers aboard multiday
boats out of Fisherman's Landing in San Diego, will spend the day
delivering baskets containing canned tuna and other staples.</TE>
<TE>   The fishing was good and the fishermen particularly generous this
year. Fletcher has gathered a record 218 cases containing 10,500 cans
of tuna.</TE>
<TE>   Hot Rods</TE>
<TE>   * San Vicente Reservoir: Greg Olson of San Diego hauled from the
depths a blue catfish weighing 53 pounds, and then caught the other
end of the bookend for a stringer totaling 91 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   * Castaic Lake: This is the hotspot for big striped bass. Mike
Glynn of Los Angeles took what is believed to be the biggest of the
week, a 26-pounder on live shad.</TE>
<TE>   On Top of the World</TE>
<TE>   Surfing's top pros are basking in the balmy spotlight of Hawaii,
which is where the season winds down every year. The men have been
getting all the attention but the women have also been making waves.
Notably Julia Christian of Carlsbad.</TE>
<TE>   Christian's surprising victory last week on Oahu's North Shore in
the Turtle Bay Resort Women's Pro -- the second leg of the Vans
Triple Crown of Surfing -- gave her enough World Qualifying Series
points to earn a spot on next year's prestigious World Championship
Tour.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in disbelief," she said of becoming the only surfer from the
mainland United States to have qualified for the WCT.</TE>
<TE>   The victory also gave her a wild-card entry into the Billabong Pro
Maui, the season-ending WCT event in progress at Honolua Bay.
Christian is still in contention, having eliminated four-time world
champion Layne Beachley in the third round.</TE>
<TE>   This year's world champion will be determined during the Billabong
Maui Pro. The front-runner is Keala Kennelly of Kauai.</TE>
<TE>   Honoring Eddie</TE>
<TE>   The holding period of the annual Quiksilver Eddie Aikau Big-Wave
Invitational has begun and organizers have until Feb. 28 to run the
contest, held only when wave heights reach at least 20 feet -- 40
feet on the faces. The contest, won last winter by Kelly Slater, is a
tribute to Eddie Aikau, the surfer and lifeguard, who died swimming
for help when his 16-member canoe capsized during a storm.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart H. Coleman has profiled Aikau's life in the book, "Eddie
Would Go: The Story of Eddie Aikau, Hawaiian Hero." It's available
through eddiewouldgo.com and amazon.com. Coleman will begin a
Southland book-signing tour Tuesday from 7-9 p.m. at Duke's in
Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   Lonely Days</TE>
<TE>   Competitors in the Around Alone solo yacht race will enjoy a
rollicking Christmas at sea aboard their respective vessels. The
second of five legs in the grueling six-month solo yacht race begins
Saturday in Cape Town, South Africa, and will not end until the boats
reach Taurino, New Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   "The southern ocean is cold, gray and often mean," said Brad Van
Liew, skipper of the Tommy Hilfiger Freedom America. "This amazing
region of water surrounding Antarctica is the roughest sailing on
earth."</TE>
<TE>   Van Liew, 34, a USC graduate who now lives in Mt. Pleasant, S.C.,
breezed to an easy victory during the first leg from New York to
Torbay, England, and set a world record during his second-leg
triumph, covering 345.03 miles in 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   It was the most mileage ever in one day aboard a 50-foot monohull.
Van Liew, who made it from Torbay to Cape Town in 44 days, leads his
nearest competitor by 890 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Van Liew is sailing in Class II, open to vessels 40-50 feet.
Bernard Stamm of Switzerland, aboard the Bobst Group-Armor Lux, was
the top finisher in Class I, for boats 50-60 feet. Having also won
the first leg, Stamm made the crossing to Cape Town in just under 30
days.</TE>
<TE>   Taking Wing</TE>
<TE>   Duck hunters throughout Southern California are starting to enjoy
better success, although the averages at most places remain only
slightly better than one bird per shooter per day. Notable
exceptions, where the average has inched closer to three ducks per
hunter: the Wister Unit of the Imperial Wildlife Area near Niland,
Calif.; Lake Barrett in San Diego County, and nearby Lake Henshaw.</TE>
<TE>   Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   A group in Kobe, Japan, has been collecting used ski equipment to
donate to Mongolian children abandoned by their unemployed parents
and living in the sewers, where it's warmer. According to the online
newsletter Snow24.com, the group hopes "that skiing will produce a
rare bit of fun, physical activity for the children and potentially,
ultimately, a Mongolian Olympic competitor."</TE>
<TE>   There was no mention of any effort to provide what the children
really need: shelter, food and medicine.</TE>

<LD>The Fighting Irish are on the fast break, the head-banded forward
wearing No. 23 hits a teammate with a no-look behind-the-back pass
and Dick Vitale is off and shrieking again:</LD>
<LD>   "ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?</LD>
<LD>   "ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?</LD>
<TE>   "ARE YOU SER-I-OUS?!?</TE>
<TE>   "How many college guys or NBA guys can make that pass in
transition?!?"</TE>
<TE>   Many of them, actually.</TE>
<TE>   Many more can do more than what the player on the receiving end of
the pass did, which was miss the layup before he was fouled.</TE>
<TE>   "In the NBA, that's a jam for a dunk!" Vitale screams. "I got
goose bumps watching that! That made me think of the Magic man! Are
you kidding me?!?"</TE>
<TE>   Dickie V is screaming about a 17-year-old basketball player named
LeBron James.</TE>
<TE>   LeBron James is a senior at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in
Akron, Ohio, and his team, the proud Fighting Irish, is playing a
pre-league tournament game against Oak Hill Academy.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Walton is sitting next to Vitale. Jay Bilas and Andy Katz are
courtside.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN2 is televising this game, live on Thursday night, to a
national audience, prime time on the East Coast, giving a bunch of
16- and 17-year kids with knocking knees the Big Monday treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Are you serious?</TE>
<TE>   Are you serious?</TE>
<TE>   Are you ser-i-ous?</TE>
<TE>   It is early in the second quarter of the third game of James' high
school senior season and ESPN is there, at Cleveland State's
Convocation Center, to plug its magazine cover story about James (on
the stands now!) and the eight columns about James presently
appearing on ESPN's Web site (some great reading there, Walton
assures us!) and, already, ESPN's panting crew of announcers has
compared the kid to Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Oscar Robertson,
Kobe Bryant, Tiger Woods, Alex Rodriguez and both Williams sisters.</TE>
<TE>   "Simply put, LeBron James is the best high school basketball
player I have ever seen," Bilas told us just before tipoff. "I think
as a 17-year old, he's better than Kobe Bryant was at the same age.</TE>
<TE>   "Why? Because he is just as skilled as Kobe Bryant, but he's more
physically imposing.... He will be, without a doubt, the first pick
in the [NBA] draft."</TE>
<TE>   Unless he tears an ACL dancing at the prom. Or slips a disk from
carrying the burden of so many expectations, a burden ESPN has
noticed, but isn't about to lessen through any restraint of its own.</TE>
<TE>   "There's got to be some jitters out there, Bill," Vitale mentions
to Walton as the kid misses a couple of early shots. "There's got to
be jitters in that young guy. The scrutiny, the evaluation, the TV
cameras, the NBA scouts, the big redhead, Mr. Walton in the house. I
mean, he's got to be nervous."</TE>
<TE>   Walton: "But that's what you have to learn to deal with ... to
enjoy this moment, to learn to anticipate this stage, the spotlight
being on you."</TE>
<TE>   See, ESPN is performing a valuable service for young LeBron. By
prematurely shoving him out into the prime-time circus, they're
toughening up the kid, exposing him early to the dangers of
overexposure, so he'll know how to cope down the line, after he turns
18.</TE>
<TE>   He'll thank them for it later.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got to be so concerned about the leeches and all the people
around him and how to separate and get those out of his life and deal
with those that genuinely love and care about him," Vitale is saying.</TE>
<TE>   "Because unfortunately, Bill, he's going to have so many around
him. You know and I know. We hear about exploitation, and that
worries me, because there's a lot of that going on here. People
already now thinking about how they can make money, in an unsavory
manner, off this teenager."</TE>
<TE>   You mean like ESPN2 televising his game against Oak Hill Academy
as a lead-in to its special program about the next wave of potential
superstar athletes, featuring LeBron James?</TE>
<TE>   "People talk about hype," Vitale adds, "but you can't hide
talent."</TE>
<TE>   Not as long as ESPN has air time to fill and commercial slots and
magazines to sell.</TE>
<TE>   With James, the hype has generated its own hype. During the days
leading into Thursday's telecast, CBS' Billy Packer criticized ESPN
for airing the game and said Vitale and Walton should have turned
down the assignment.</TE>
<TE>   Walton said he had requested the assignment because he was curious
to see for himself what the hype was all about.</TE>
<TE>   Vitale said he had accepted the assignment because he's not big
enough to turn down assignments.</TE>
<TE>   Then basketball-shoe rep Sonny Vaccaro criticized Packer for
criticizing Vitale and Walton.</TE>
<TE>   The ball was rolling, wild and out of control, long before James
scored the first of his 31 points in St. Vincent-St. Mary's 65-45
victory over Oak Hill. Already, James' high school has agreed to make
10 of his games this season available throughout Ohio on
pay-per-view, $7.95 a game. A local ticket broker was selling
courtside seats to Thursday's game for $100 apiece.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not LeBron James' fault that this is all happening," Walton
acknowledged. "He's just living in the world that we've all created."</TE>
<TE>   Vitale: "All of us. We're all part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Walton: "So many things going on around him, swirling around him.
One of the things we tried to impress upon these young people is that
they are high school students and that they should enjoy this time.
They will never get this time back in their lives."</TE>
<TE>   And ESPN's cameras were on hand to help steal away one more night
of it.</TE>

<KH>Q &amp; A WITH GEORGE FOREMAN</KH>
<HD>He Used to Be the Heavy, Then He Saw the Light</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Dwyre</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>The once surly, menacing image of George Foreman is long gone, swept
out more than 20 years ago, like a lot of dust around a boxing ring.</LD>
<LD>   He smiles all the time now, looks almost slim and dapper in the
black tuxedo he wears for HBO boxing telecasts. He signs autographs,
poses for pictures, is a smiling pitchman for George Foreman grills
on TV, talks to anybody and everybody, and embraces life like
somebody with a lot of catching up to do.</LD>
<LD>   Once the self-acclaimed "most destructive heavyweight champion
ever," Foreman has gone from someone promoter Bob Arum says "was
miserable to be around to a person everybody wants to be around."
Foreman beat Joe Frazier for the title in 1973, lost it the next year
to Muhammad Ali in the legendary fight in Zaire, then quit boxing
after an exhausting defeat at the hands of Jimmy Young in 1977. He
returned to regain the heavyweight title -- at 45 -- in 1994, beating
Michael Moorer. Somewhere between Young and Moorer, a life-altering
lightbulb went off and now, at 53, a wealthy and personable George
Foreman, full-time resident of Houston and part-time resident of
Malibu, has taken his place alongside those few in sports who carry
both greatness and decency.</LD>
<TE>   Question: It all started for you with the 1968 Olympics in Mexico
City, when you won the gold medal. What are your memories?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: I went to Mexico City and suddenly, there were all these
famous athletes, people I'd been reading about and seeing on TV --
John Carlos, Tommie Smith, Debbie Meyer. They were sitting right
there in the cafeteria, the same one I was in. I looked at them and
they looked at me. I was awestruck. Then I saw my first gold medal.
Bob Beamon walked in with it hanging around his neck and it was the
most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. I just knew I had to have one of
those.</TE>
<TE>   Q: And then you won one, and you were up there on the victory
stand, and ...</TE>
<TE>   A: That's when you realize, "I'm an American." You hear them play
your song and you are all alone on top and you realize that those
other guys can't go up there. That's your spot. It's right there that
all adjectives die. You are an American.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Where do you keep your gold medal?</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't have it. I donated it to the Texas Hall of Fame. I
wanted young people to be able to see it, and to feel like I did when
I first saw one.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Will you get it back one day?</TE>
<TE>   A: Nope.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The Olympics had to be the start of your transition, but before
that, it was pretty much lots of bad stuff growing up, correct? I've
read stories, for example, of how you used to hold victims upside
down in the streets while your accomplices in crime would empty the
person's pockets.</TE>
<TE>   A: I was a mugger. There was a point in my life where my only goal
was to go to jail because when I got out, I'd be one of the special
guys. Those were the guys who got the respect. They'd come out of
jail and the other guys would want to hang around them and buy them
cherry Cokes. I didn't only want to go to jail, I wanted to come out
with a scar. That's when you really got respect, when you had that
big scar along your cheek. I faked it for a while. I wore a Band-Aid.</TE>
<TE>   Q: When you lost to Ali in Zaire, it was a bitter loss. Are you OK
with it now?</TE>
<TE>   A: Oh, yes. I remember just punishing him for three, four, five,
six rounds. Then, in the eighth, I hit him with a couple of great
shots and he finally went into a clinch. And we're in this clinch and
he's breathing heavy and I'm pretty tired and he whispers in my ear,
"Is that all you've got?" And I remember thinking, "Well, as a matter
of fact, yes, it is."</TE>
<TE>   Q: Did you hate him for a while?</TE>
<TE>   A: How ever you describe the word "hate," yes, that's what I had.
I hated him. Then, years ago, I was being interviewed by Allan
Malamud (the late Times' columnist) and he asked me a question about
it, and I said that I got beat, that he knocked me out, that I lost
fair and square. And from that moment on, I was free. Just to say it,
face it, made me a free man. And all I could think of was to find Ali
and talk to him.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Did you?</TE>
<TE>   A: We are great friends. Ali is like my brother now. Over the
years, we have become very close. I can close my eyes and think of
Ali. And if you lean close and listen to him, he will say good things
about George Foreman. I know that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Tell me more about how you changed your life and your
personality.</TE>
<TE>   A: I went into the streets to preach. And people would pass me by.
And at first, I didn't want to tell them I was George Foreman, but I
figured out that if I did, they would stop. And if they would stop,
then I could do business. It was hard, and it was hot, but I kept on
preaching. One day, a man walked by and blew smoke in my face. I let
it go, and he did it again. The third time, I got up close to him and
said, quietly, "Do you know who I am and what I could do to you?" His
eyes got real big and he left. The people watching thought I had said
something like "God love you," so they stayed around and listened.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is it hard staying like you are now?</TE>
<TE>   A: I remember [during his comeback in the early '90s] after I lost
to Evander Holyfield and I was hungry and I went to an IHOP and I
ordered a big stack of pancakes and I had just started to eat when a
man came by and asked me to sign something. I told him to let me
finish my meal first. And he started to walk away. My wife looked at
me and said that I can't be nice just sometimes, or when it is easy.
If I'm going to be nice to people, I have to be that way all the
time. And so I called the guy back and signed with one hand while I
ate with the other. I vowed never to pretend again, and I haven't.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Then, incredibly, at 45, you came back, 20 years after you had
last held the heavyweight championship of the world, and won it again
when you beat Moorer. What did that feel like?</TE>
<TE>   A: There have been few things better. I always believed that I'd
get back there, but once it had happened, and I was standing there in
that ring, it was like I really knew what it meant to be heavyweight
champ. Before Mexico City and the Olympics, I was a 19-year-old kid
who had never had one dream come true in his life. And there I was,
heavyweight champ. Again.</TE>

<HD>It's Just the Ticket for DirecTV</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DirecTV has secured the NFL Sunday Ticket pay package exclusively
through the 2005 season and nonexclusively through the 2007 season.</LD>
<LD>   That means the package will be available only on DirecTV for three
years. It could become available on digital cable as well after that,
although not be on another satellite service.</LD>
<LD>   The five-year agreement provides DirecTV with a powerful weapon in
its war with cable and satellite rivals.</LD>
<TE>   NFL Sunday Ticket, which allows viewers to get all Sunday daytime
games televised by CBS and Fox, is by far the most popular of the pay
sports packages.</TE>
<TE>   To get the package exclusively, DirecTV had to pay a hefty price.
The cost has been reported at $400 million a year, or $2 billion over
the duration of the contract.</TE>
<TE>   Eddy Hartenstein, DirecTV president, said Thursday those figures
were not totally accurate. He said the deal is worth less than $2
billion over five years, and it is structured so that most of the
money is paid in the later years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're certainly not paying $400 million next year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, DirecTV has been hit with a huge increase. The current
five-year, $650-million deal that expires at the end of the season is
worth an average of $130 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   So the question is, how much of that increased cost is going to be
passed on to the customer?</TE>
<TE>   The package, which has been in existence since 1995 and always
exclusive to DirecTV, now costs from $139 to $199 for a season,
depending on when it is ordered and what promotional offers are in
effect at the time.</TE>
<TE>   There are now about 1.5 million subscribers generating less than
$300 million a year. At that rate, DirecTV could stand to lose more
than $100 million a year under the new deal.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to mislead your readers and say [the cost] is going
to be flat," Hartenstein said. "But we've always delivered great
value for our customers. We're not going to do anything wild or
crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Hartenstein said the hope is that much of the additional cost will
be absorbed by the continual growth of DirecTV and added sales for
NFL Sunday Ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Hartenstein also pointed out that the new deal calls for enhanced
technical innovations, such as high-definition game telecasts,
viewer-selected camera and replays and other advanced digital
technology.</TE>
<TE>   Also part of the deal will be a new channel, devoted solely to NFL
programming.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the destination for all sports fans," Hartenstein said.
"If it's a ball or a puck, we've got it."</TE>
<TE>   A Long Process</TE>
<TE>   Hartenstein said that although the ownership of DirecTV is in
limbo -- a proposed merger with Dish Network owner EchoStar has
fallen through -- that was not a factor in the negotiations with the
NFL. But ironing out all the details and arriving at acceptable
financial terms wasn't easy.</TE>
<TE>   DirecTV was always out front, and it was reported here on Nov. 1
that an exclusive deal was imminent.</TE>
<TE>   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, during a conference call
announcing the deal Wednesday, said, "We had discussions during the
past nine months with everybody in the broadcast television business,
satellite television, cable television, many, many different
providers of new technology, such as high-definition and interactive
features. This agreement is the result of a very thorough analysis
from our perspective of our choices and the future direction of
television."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Brenner, chief executive of In Demand, which supplies pay
sports packages to digital cable, listened in on the conference call
and wasn't buying everything Tagliabue was saying.</TE>
<TE>   "I was disappointed in what he said," Brenner said after the
conference call. "I don't think we were ever in the picture."</TE>
<TE>   Digital cable entities such as In Demand can make another run at
the package after the 2005 season, which is also when the NFL's
eight-year, $17.6-billion contracts with ABC, ESPN, Fox and CBS
expire.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd be foolish not to go after it," Brenner said, "but we wanted
it now."</TE>
<TE>   Denver Bronco owner Pat Bowlen, the chairman of the NFL's
six-member broadcast committee, said the cable industry faced two
obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   "No. 1, they were not in a position to pay the kind of rights fee
we were seeking," he said. "And No. 2, CBS and Fox, which produce the
games, had to agree to let cable have the package.</TE>
<TE>   "With DirecTV, we're in 11 million homes. With cable, it would
have been, what, 80 million? That would have had a huge impact on our
over-the-air broadcast partners. We realized that, and they realized
that."</TE>
<TE>   Digital cable, in one form or another, is now in about 30 million
homes but has the potential to reach 80 million.</TE>
<TE>   "After three years, [digital cable] will have another bite at the
cherry," Bowlen said.</TE>
<TE>   Back on TV</TE>
<TE>   ESPN's Dan Patrick went to Coconut Grove, Fla., Thursday to
interview O.J. Simpson. The interview will be shown as the "Sunday
Conversation" on the ESPN "SportsCenter" after NFL football Sunday
night.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't there to re-try the case, but with another USC player up
for the Heisman, we wanted to see what life was like now for one of
the greatest football players of all time," Patrick said. "He told me
people don't treat him like a pariah, and that he doesn't live in a
cocoon. He watches football games with friends and plays lots of
golf. But he also says he's had to keep friends from going after some
people who shout things at him in public."</TE>
<TE>   In the interview, Simpson says, "A couple of times I've seen
people get up in the middle of their meals and leave. And I've got to
say it, 'I'm glad I ruined your meal. If you feel I'm a murderer, and
you feel that way about me, go, leave.' I don't say it, but I think
it. I'm human. I hope you're as uncomfortable as you can be when I'm
around, and I'll be around."</TE>
<TE>   Super Station Update</TE>
<TE>   Sports talk radio stations XTRA and KXTA will become one on Jan. 6
and be known as "XTRA Sports 690 and 1150." The merger was to have
happened Monday but was delayed because of vacations.</TE>
<TE>   The new simulcast lineup will be Tony Bruno, Jim Rome, "Loose
Cannons" Steve Hartman and Bill Werndl, and Lee Hamilton. At night,
when there isn't a UCLA or Clipper game, it will the Fox Radio
network's J.T. the Brick, who has gone from being a Rome "smack-off"
winner to having his own national show.</TE>
<TE>   That means no more "Kiley and Booms." Actually, Chuck Booms was
let go last week and Steve Mason was brought in as Kevin Kiley's new
partner.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Golfers in the Office Depot Father/Son Challenge, which is being
televised by NBC this weekend, are getting younger all the time. The
field includes Javier Ballesteros and Stefan Langer, each 12....
Preceding the Father/Son Challenge on NBC Sunday at 10 a.m. will be a
one-hour special, "Every Moment Counts," featuring PGA Tour-supported
charities.</TE>
<TE>   Next week the Golf Channel will dedicate 14 hours of programming
to what it is calling "Greatest Golf Moments Week," a look back at
the year in golf.... Included in Lifetime's taped NHK Trophy figure
skating coverage Sunday at 10 a.m. will be a documentary on the
judging controversy at this year's Winter Olympics.... Fox Sports Net
has dispatched Carolyn Hughes and Petros Papadakis to New York to
cover Carson Palmer's bid to win the Heisman Trophy.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Guerrero, you can't top this. Fox Sports Net's Lisa Dergan is

<HD>Bruins Cutting Down Choices</HD>
<DH>Riley is expected to meet with chancellor, but Guerrero
wants to talk to Dorrell before making final decision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New Orleans Saint assistant Mike Riley staved off giving Alabama an
answer for another day and is expected to meet with UCLA Chancellor
Albert Carnesale to finalize an offer to become coach of the Bruins.</LD>
<LD>   However, UCLA Athletic Director Dan Guerrero is doing some
stalling of his own. He doesn't want the Bruins to commit to Riley
until he conducts an interview Saturday with Denver Bronco assistant
Karl Dorrell.</LD>
<LD>   Riley, however, needs assurances fast. New Orleans Coach Jim
Haslett said Wednesday that Riley is set to meet with Carnesale after
the Saints play Sunday, but Riley might travel to Los Angeles after
an early-afternoon practice today because Alabama is pressuring him
to respond to a five-year offer that sources said is worth $1.3
million a year.</LD>
<TE>   Alabama Athletic Director Mal Moore requested a response by
Wednesday morning, but the deadline passed and the offer was not
withdrawn. Three coaches -- Frank Beamer of Virginia Tech, Jim
Leavitt of South Florida and Crimson Tide assistant Carl Torbush --
already have spurned Alabama offers, so Moore has little choice but
to wait it out with Riley.</TE>
<TE>   There are two sticking points, according to sources. Riley wants a
longer deal because the Crimson Tide is on NCAA probation, and he
requested that Alabama pay him an additional $750,000 next year
because a contract with his previous employer, the San Diego
Chargers, guarantees him that amount unless he takes another head
coaching position.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's offer would be substantially less, in the $700,000 range,
plus incentives. But Riley's wife and two high school-age children
live in San Diego and reportedly are pushing for him to return to
Southern California. He has said that he would accept less money to
come to UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   However, the $750,000 he would forfeit from the Chargers could
again become a point of contention because sources indicate that UCLA
would be even less inclined to pay it than Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Riley, who declined comment after practice, is also under
consideration for the opening at Kentucky. Wildcat Athletic Director
Mitch Barnhart worked with Riley at Oregon State in 1997-98.</TE>
<TE>   Before Oregon State, Riley was offensive coordinator for four
years at USC. He directed Oregon State to a 5-6 record in 1998, its
best in 27 years, and many of the players he recruited helped the
Beavers go 10-1 and win the Fiesta Bowl two years later under Dennis
Erickson.</TE>
<TE>   Riley's three years with the Chargers did not go as well. He was
unable to develop first-round pick Ryan Leaf into an NFL quarterback
and the Chargers were 14-34, including a 1-15 record in 2000. They
lost their last nine games in 2001 and Riley was fired.</TE>
<TE>   Given Riley's ho-hum record, some UCLA boosters openly wonder why
he is so highly regarded. Guerrero's focus has been almost
exclusively on Riley and Dorrell, a former UCLA player with a strong
resume as an assistant and substantial support among former Bruin
players.</TE>
<TE>   But those same boosters admire Guerrero for not committing to
Riley before interviewing Dorrell, whose only question mark is a lack
of head coaching experience.</TE>
<TE>   "In the best of all worlds, yes, you'd like someone who has
experience making the calls," Guerrero said Wednesday. "But
possessing the qualities that go into a successful head coach is more
important."</TE>
<TE>   Several potential candidates are waiting to hear from Guerrero.
Greg Robinson, the Kansas City Chief defensive coordinator and a
former UCLA assistant, has not been contacted for an interview
despite public backing from Chief Coach Dick Vermeil. Robinson is
respected as an excellent defensive coach and a hard-nosed
disciplinarian, qualities that Guerrero is seeking.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State Coach Mike Price and former Oregon coach Rich
Brooks are potential candidates should Riley and Dorrell be bypassed.
However, Washington Coach Rick Neuheisel -- who earlier this week
discreetly put out feelers about the job -- made it clear Wednesday
at a Sun Bowl news conference that he is not a candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no desire to change jobs," Neuheisel said.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero doesn't appear to be in a hurry to make a decision. At a
Las Vegas Bowl news conference Wednesday, he said there is no urgency
to hire a coach before the Christmas Day game between the Bruins and
New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   He plans to attend the NCAA men's soccer final Sunday in Dallas
provided UCLA wins a semifinal today. However, he might be inclined
to stay close to campus and monitor Riley's meeting with Carnesale.</TE>
<TE>   "People understand the nature of the business," Guerrero said.
"There is no deadline."</TE>

<LD>With Carson Palmer traveling the country on the college football
award circuit, USC's other quarterbacks are getting an opportunity to
take more snaps in practice and begin competing for the starting job
next season.</LD>
<LD>   Sophomore Matt Cassel and redshirt freshman Billy Hart split time
Thursday. Each quarterback said it was the most snaps he had taken in
practice since high school.</LD>
<LD>   "It was fun," Cassel said. "I got to play a little bit, get a feel
for the offense. It's definitely a good opportunity to get reps and
get back into it. And it makes an impression on coaches if you do
well in this time period."</LD>
<TE>   Cassel, who has played sparingly this season as the Trojans' No. 2
quarterback, said he feels confident he will emerge as Palmer's
successor.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at myself as being a front-runner," he said. "I'm
definitely ready to go out and be the starter for next year."</TE>
<TE>   Though he had two passes intercepted Thursday, Cassel said he was
pleased with the way he threw the ball and ran the offense.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I did well. Obviously, there's still getting a little
rust off here and there."</TE>
<TE>   Hart said it was strange being at practice without Palmer, a
fifth-year senior who has started since his freshman year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot different," Hart said. "We get a chance to play. Plus
he's not here to make us look bad."</TE>
<TE>   Two other quarterbacks who figure in the competition, redshirt
freshman Matt Leinart and junior Brandon Hance, missed Thursday's
practice because they were taking final exams.</TE>
<TE>   Offensive coordinator Norm Chow said Hance and Leinart would take
the majority of snaps in today's practice. Hance, a transfer from
Purdue, had shoulder surgery last spring and could have his duties
restricted.</TE>
<TE>   Chow said he expects a wide-open race in spring practice, which
starts in March.</TE>

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Success at Faceoffs Has Been a Team Effort</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks have done very well at winning faceoffs this season,
and ranked second in the NHL before Thursday's games with a 55.08%
success rate.</LD>
<LD>   But unlike the other top faceoff-winning teams, which have strong
one-two punches, the Ducks have been getting it done by committee.</LD>
<LD>   Kevyn Adams and Rod Brind'Amour of Carolina, and Dave Andreychuk
and Tim Taylor of Tampa Bay normally rank among the league's top 15
in faceoff percentage among players with at least 100 draws, but the
Ducks don't have any that high.</LD>
<TE>   But the Ducks have a trio among the top 25 -- Marc Chouinard, Adam
Oates and Andy McDonald.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Rucchin and Matt Cullen also take a lot of draws and win
more than 50%.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are Jason Krog, Dan Bylsma, Petr Sykora and Patric
Kjellberg, who don't take as many but, combined, have won more than
60%.</TE>
<TE>   "The more you have control of the puck, the less they can shoot,"
goaltender Jean-Sebastien Giguere said. "So that definitely helps you
win games."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Mike Babcock makes sure the Ducks never take their faceoff
success for granted. "A big winning percentage for a team is 55%,
which means that you lose 45% of the time," he said. "You need them
all, but you never know for sure. All you can do is the best you
can."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' faceoff success is one reason behind Giguere's recent
hot streak, which includes consecutive home shutouts of Nashville and
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere, who has not allowed a goal in 140 minutes 15 seconds, is
4-1-1 with a .938 save mark over his last six games, allowing two
goals or fewer in five of them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks will take part in the fourth annual Dux in Tux charity
event today at Hyatt Regency Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The event features players and coaches serving as waiters and has
raised nearly $1 million to benefit the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation
and Mighty Ducks Care charities.</TE>

<LD>Darin Erstad, the Angels' Gold Glove center fielder, set the American
League record for consecutive errorless chances by an outfielder and
didn't know it at the time.</LD>
<LD>   Erstad had 723 consecutive chances from May 30, 2001, to last
Sept. 22, breaking Ken Griffey Jr.'s record of 573.</LD>
<LD>   Erstad also set the single-season AL record with 458 consecutive

<HD>Anaheim Canyon's Baseball Field Is Damaged by Vandals</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The baseball field at Anaheim Canyon High was vandalized Monday night
or early Tuesday morning, Canyon baseball Coach Joe Hoggatt said.</LD>
<LD>   Vandals dug two letters six inches deep into the infield grass and
a swastika near the backstop, Hoggatt said. They also poured dry
concrete mix around the field, broke several sprinklers and stole
home plate.</LD>
<LD>   "I've worked so many hours on this field, spent so much time,"
said Hoggatt, who replaced Mike Najera in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Hoggatt said two workers spent 4 1/2 hours Tuesday repairing the
field, which had undergone $15,000 in renovations during the previous
two years. He said many of his players were in disbelief when they
saw what had happened, but quickly began cleaning up the mess.</TE>
<TE>   "Even some ex-players came down [Tuesday]," Hoggatt said. "It was
pretty cool to see the group bond together."</TE>
<TE>   Hoggatt filed a police report but said there are no suspects. He
also said his field office was broken into Sunday night and his
television, VCR and stereo were stolen.</TE>

<TE>   Funeral services for Sara Rojas, a basketball player for Phelan
Serrano and a trainer for the Diamondback football team, will be held
at 11 a.m. today at Desert View Cemetery in Victorville.</TE>
<TE>   Rojas, 17, a senior from Adelanto, was killed in a one-car
automobile accident on Dec. 5 after being ejected from a sport
utility vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   She and two passengers were navigating a dirt road in Pinon Hills
when the SUV rolled over.</TE>
<TE>   The other two female students were not seriously injured.</TE>
<TE>   The football team dedicated last week's Division VIII semifinal
game, a 37-36 victory over Cathedral City, to Rojas.</TE>

<LD>   Woodland Hills Taft (13-0) vs. Lake Balboa Birmingham (10-3), at
Coliseum, 8</LD>
<LD>   The gloves are off between these two rivals and a week of
back-and-forth sniping can now be settled on the field in a rematch
of the West Valley League title-deciding game won by Taft, 30-6, on
Nov. 15. Taft, No. 6 in The Times' rankings, will look to secure its
place in City Section history while Birmingham tries for the upset
and its first major-division championship since 1963. In City title
games involving rematches, the loser of the regular-season game has
won the title in three of the last four seasons. The Patriots, who
will be without suspended receiver Bennie Ward, will need a better
game on offense to have a chance. In the first meeting, Taft's speedy
defense, led by linebacker Lance Broadus and a dominating secondary,
held running back Dennis Keyes to 86 yards and harassed quarterback
Ryan Lombardo into a subpar performance. With five receptions, Taft's
Steve Smith can end his career as the state record holder. Smith
enters the game with 265 receptions in three varsity seasons.</LD>

<TE>   SOUTHERN SECTION</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks Notre Dame (13-0) vs. Manhattan Beach Mira Costa
(13-0) at El Camino College, 7:30</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Mira Costa (No. 7) is seeking its first Division III
championship. Can No. 2-seeded Notre Dame (No. 16) reverse a recent
trend of title-game frustration to win one of its own? Mira Costa's
offense has been almost perfect, averaging 40 points in the playoffs
behind the throwing of Peter Dobush, the catching of Nick Haley and
the running of Michael Okwo. If any team can stop Mira Costa, it's
Notre Dame. Led by defensive lineman Alex Puccinelli (22 sacks), the
Knights have been stingy all season and have allowed an average of
12.3 points in three playoff victories. Notre Dame is trying for its
first Division III championship since a 27-20 victory over Chino
Hills Ayala in 1994. Championship games haven't been as kind to Notre
Dame since -- the Knights lost Division III title games against
Camarillo in 1996 and Arroyo Grande in 1997. Mira Costa won the
Division VII title in 1993 and the Division IX championship in 1997,
but lost to eventual champion Newhall Hart in the 2000 final and 2001
semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   -- Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   Westlake Village Westlake (11-2) vs. Ventura St. Bonaventure
(12-1) at Moorpark High, 7:30</TE>
<TE>   A victory by top-seeded St. Bonaventure (No. 10) would give the
Seraphs their first Division IV championship after winning Division
XI the three previous years. A Westlake win would give the Warriors
their second Division IV championship in four years. St.
Bonaventure's Whitney Lewis, one of the most heavily recruited
players in the nation, has rushed for 863 yards and 20 touchdowns and
caught 59 passes for 1,076 yards and 14 touchdowns. Westlake, which
was 1-2 after three games, has a highly regarded defense led by
linemen Jimmy Miller and Michael Stuart and an offense led by the
bruising running of Merrill Mullaly and the passing of Erik Vose.
Mullaly didn't play extensively until the fourth game of the season,
but has rushed for 1,547 yards and 17 touchdowns. Vose has passed for
2,164 yards and 12 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   -- John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   Corona Centennial (11-2) vs. Riverside North (10-3) at Riverside
Norte Vista High, 7:30</TE>
<TE>   The advantage in this Division V game might go to the first team
that forces a punt. Centennial (No. 12) was already averaging 44
points before rolling up 53 against Moreno Valley Canyon Springs in a
semifinal. North (No. 24) can also score in a hurry, evidenced by its
four third-quarter touchdowns against Temecula Chaparral in a
quarterfinal. Centennial's defense has also played well in big games,
turning five San Clemente turnovers into 20 points in a 26-12 victory
in Week 4. North will need a big game from Damon Morton, a defensive
back and wide receiver who was chosen the state's best sophomore
player last year by Cal-Hi Sports.</TE>
<TE>   -- Dan Arritt</TE>
<TE>   Hacienda Heights Los Altos (11-2) vs. Santa Ana Foothill (11-2) at
Edison Field, 7:30</TE>
<TE>   The first order of business for top-seeded Los Altos (No. 17) is
slowing down Mike Liti, who has rushed for 2,136 yards, and the
second is pressuring Don Poole, who has passed for 2,753 yards.
Second-seeded Foothill has the most balanced offense in Division VI
and has averaged 37.8 points in its last four games. Los Altos has
been more run-oriented with Randall Brown and Daniel Drayton,
averaging 39 points the last month, but to win a third title in four
seasons -- and first in Division VI -- the Conquerors will need a
solid effort from quarterback Carlos Ordonez.</TE>
<TE>   -- Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove Pacifica (11-2) vs. La Habra at CS Fullerton (12-1),
7</TE>
<TE>   One of these teams will win its first section title in this
Division IX matchup. Each has been close. This is Pacifica's third
championship-game appearance in its 37 years, and it's the second
time in three years for No. 21 La Habra, which lost to Covina South
Hills in 2000. Each has a nine-game winning streak and averages more
than 30 points. Pacifica running back David Heller holds the school
season rushing record with 2,020 yards. He has scored 23 touchdowns.
Quarterback Justin Turner has passed for 2,041 yards and 12
touchdowns. La Habra quarterback Daniel Morales has six elusive
receivers, each with at least five touchdown catches. Morales has
passed for 2,693 yards and 27 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   -- Paul McLeod</TE>
<TE>   Lompoc (10-3) at Gardena Serra (13-0), 7</TE>
<TE>   Strong running games and solid defenses are the calling cards for
these Division X finalists. Top-seeded Serra is led by Ryan Kelly,
who has 1,730 yards rushing and averages 9.4 yards a carry.
Quarterback Corey Jones adds balance with 1,257 yards passing and an
average of 21.7 yards per completion. Serra has allowed 12.8 points a
game this season and has outscored its playoff opponents, 82-29.
Lompoc relies on a two-man rushing attack with Robert Adams (1,125
yards in 208 carries) and Matt Winn (915 yards in 151 carries); Winn
has 383 yards in three playoff games. Lompoc allows 12.4 points a
game. Lompoc, which is 1-7 in championship games, last made a final
in 1995. Serra is making its second championship-game appearance and
first since a 34-31 victory over Lompoc in the 1989 final.</TE>

<HD>Okwo Stirs Memories for Notre Dame Staff</HD>
<DH>Knights couldn't stop Mira Costa's two-way star two years
ago, but will try again in Division III championship.</DH>

<LD>The coaching staff at Sherman Oaks Notre Dame had assembled before
the start of spring football.</LD>
<LD>   The coaches went into a room where they watched film -- a room
where English was taught during school hours -- and sat down amid a
bust of Shakespeare and walls that were filled with book posters.
Then they popped in a tape of a real classic -- two-way star Michael
Okwo of Manhattan Beach Mira Costa.</LD>
<LD>   Back in March, Notre Dame coaches were watching film of the
running back and linebacker, a 6-foot, 215-pound turbine that powers
the Mustangs. Notre Dame had experienced his ferocity two seasons
ago, when as a sophomore, Okwo carved up the Knights for 253 yards
and four touchdowns in 46 carries as Mira Costa won a Southern
Section Division III playoff semifinal.</LD>
<TE>   "We wanted to see the things we needed to do better fundamentally
against physical teams," said Notre Dame defensive coordinator Joe
McNab of that film session. "We needed to get better. They were huge
and tough."</TE>
<TE>   The Knights (13-0) will find out tonight if they are tough enough
to stay with Okwo and Mira Costa (13-0) in the Southern Section
Division III championship at El Camino College in Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   As Notre Dame tries to win its first Division III title since
1994, talk at practice this week centered on Okwo, who has received
offers from UCLA, Stanford, USC and Oregon State, among others.</TE>
<TE>   It will not be easy to account for Okwo on defense -- he has seven
sacks, five forced fumbles and 114 tackles.</TE>
<TE>   Nor will it be easy to stop him on offense -- Okwo has 2,342 yards
rushing and 30 touchdowns in 235 carries, an average of 10 yards per
carry.</TE>
<TE>   In his 23rd season at Notre Dame, Coach Kevin Rooney has seen
plenty of dominant defenders, but he hasn't seen an inside linebacker
like Okwo.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think of anybody with his combination of speed and
toughness," Rooney said. "If you run away from him, he gets to the
ball. If you run right at him, he stuffs it."</TE>
<TE>   So what does Notre Dame plan to do tonight on offense?</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Marcel Marquez, a 6-foot, 195-pound senior, might be
the Knights' most versatile quarterback in Rooney's tenure. Dangerous
with the ball on an option keeper, Marquez can also throw with power
and accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez will need good blocking to spring free on the outside or
to scan the field in throwing situations. Linemen will have to
account for Okwo before every snap. He won't be hard to find -- he
usually lines up a few feet off the ball, across from a guard or
tackle -- but he'll be hard to stop.</TE>
<TE>   "A guard will come out to block him and [Okwo] will rock him
backwards," Rooney said after studying Okwo on film. "We'll need to
get guys on him and get them to stay with him."</TE>
<TE>   The Mustangs' closest call in the playoffs was a 21-17
quarterfinal victory over Santa Fe Springs St. Paul in rainy, soggy
conditions. Okwo had 177 yards rushing in 35 carries and scored the
go-ahead touchdown early in the fourth quarter. Most important, he
came up with a game-saving tackle in the final minute, tracking down
a St. Paul receiver who appeared to have a clear path to the end zone
after catching a pass inside the Mira Costa 30-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   "There were just a few seconds to go and our guy broke free, but
Okwo somehow ran him down," St. Paul Coach Marijon Ancich said. "He
was the difference."</TE>
<TE>   The margin of error is very slim for Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll need to keep the football away from [Mira Costa]," Ancich
said. "Work the play-action and option game efficiently. And they'll
have to figure out some way to run at [Okwo] with a double-team
[blocking scheme]. He's a nasty guy, as good as anybody we've seen."</TE>

<LD>It's championship weekend in high school football, and for once, no
one really knows who is the best team in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Long Beach Poly's elimination from the Southern Section Division I
playoffs last week leaves a void at the top.</LD>
<LD>   If there were a bowl championship series for high schools in the
Southland, choosing the teams to play for the championship would be
no easy task.</LD>
<TE>   Taking into consideration strength of schedule, won-loss record,
talent and head-to-head comparisons, the BCS version for high school
would come down to four teams: Los Alamitos (12-0-1), Mission Viejo
(13-0), Newhall Hart (12-0-1) and Woodland Hills Taft (13-0).</TE>
<TE>   That leaves out Santa Ana Mater Dei (10-3), which deserves plenty
of respect for beating Poly, 21-20. But three defeats leave the
Monarchs out of consideration.</TE>
<TE>   First, let's take up the case for Taft, which plays Lake Balboa
Birmingham tonight for the City title at the Coliseum. The usual
argument is that City teams can't compete against top Southern
Section teams. Taft, though, is not your typical City team.</TE>
<TE>   "Their skill people are as good any skill people in Southern
California," Hart Coach Mike Herrington said.</TE>
<TE>   Taft possesses more speed than any school playing for a
championship. In a one-game situation, with the likes of receivers
Steve Smith and Noah Smith, quarterback Cary Dove and linebacker
Lance Broadus, the Toreadors would be a formidable opponent.</TE>
<TE>   The best game of the weekend is Saturday's Division II final
between Hart and Mission Viejo at Edison Field. The winner deserves a
spot in the BCS final. Hart has a 35-game unbeaten streak; Mission
Viejo's winning streak is at 27.</TE>
<TE>   "You have two teams going out on the field who know how to win and
expect to win," Mission Viejo Coach Bob Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Hart is the USC of high schools because it has played perhaps the
toughest nonleague schedule. Among its opponents were City finalist
Lake Balboa Birmingham, Division IV finalists Westlake Village
Westlake and Ventura St. Bonaventure and Division I finalist Los
Alamitos. A tie to Los Alamitos in the opening game is the lone
blemish.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo owns a victory over Mater Dei and has the most
dominating offensive lineman in Southern California in USC-bound Drew
Radovich. The Diablos have the consensus No. 1 defense, and the
offense has become unpredictable with the emergence of scrambling
quarterback Marty Tadman.</TE>
<TE>   Like Hart, Los Alamitos has improved each week and enters its
Division I final Saturday against Mater Dei in peak form. Coach John
Barnes has two players who will go down as among the best in school
history -- junior defensive back Randy Estes and sophomore receiver
Jeremy Childs.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's time to poke holes in the arguments for the individual
teams.</TE>
<TE>   Taft gave up 34 points to San Fernando, the fifth-place team in
Valley Mission League. "They play a schedule like Kansas State," said
one coach.</TE>
<TE>   Hart was only six points ahead in the final minute against
Birmingham, a team Taft defeated, 30-6.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo's offense has sputtered against quality teams,
leaving little room for error if the Diablos' rock-solid defense has
a bad night.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos barely got past Carson, 34-26. Taft beat Carson,
39-0.</TE>
<TE>   So who belongs in the high school final? The matchup should be the
Hart-Mission Viejo victor against Los Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, in the end, no one would be able to shout, "We're No.
1," because that title belongs to Concord De La Salle, the Northern
California school that has a 138-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Halftime entertainment for tonight's City Championship game should
be a mud wrestling contest at midfield between Coach Ed Croson of
Birmingham and Coach Troy Starr of Taft. Birmingham Athletic Director
Rick Prizant could serve as Croson's tag-team partner.</TE>
<TE>   All week, the two schools have been exchanging charges instead of
exchanging films. Check that, they did exchange films -- Taft turning
over tape of Birmingham fighting in the semifinals and Birmingham
revealing tape of Taft hosting a prized eighth-grader on its
sideline.</TE>
<TE>   The childish behavior of the adults has distracted from what
should be the most exciting athletic moment for everyone involved.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not happy about the climate between the two schools," City
Section Commissioner Barbara Fiege said.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's game is an opportunity for the kids to show the adults
how to act with dignity and class.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Clausen, the most highly touted incoming freshman
quarterback since Todd Marinovich, said Thursday he plans to attend
Westlake Village Oaks Christian.</TE>
<TE>   Clausen's brothers are college quarterbacks. Casey Clausen plays
for Tennessee and Rick Clausen for LSU.</TE>

<LD>Even though he trails Laffit Pincay, Jr. and Alex Solis in the jockey
standings at Hollywood Park, Victor Espinoza has to be considered the
favorite to win the title.</LD>
<LD>   With eight racing days remaining before the scene shifts back to
Santa Anita, Espinoza has 26 winners, three less than Pincay and one
fewer than Solis, but both of those riders will be absent in the
coming days.</LD>
<LD>   Pincay will miss the final six days of the meet because of a
suspension and a trip to Calder where he will be honored by the
track. Solis, meanwhile, will vacation for three days next week.</LD>
<TE>   Espinoza, who had three winners on Wednesday, has mounts in five
of the eight races on today's card, but none of them are favored.</TE>
<TE>   One of his rides is on an interesting first-time starter for
trainer Bobby Frankel.</TE>
<TE>   Gassan Royal, a son of 1990 Breeders' Cup Mile winner Royal
Academy, will face seven other 2-year-old maidens in the third at 1
1/16 miles on the turf. He is listed at 8-1 on Russ Hudak's morning
line.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Gassan Royal, Espinoza will ride 8-1 longshot Northern
Colony in the second, 15-1 outsider Tangara in the fifth, 12-1
longshot Popular in the sixth and 8-1 longshot Dena's Diamond in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fifth at Hollywood Park is a $62,500 claimer
for older fillies and mares at one mile on the turf. Contenders
include the comebacking Onaccountofyou, Desiraes My Candy and Last
Tango. It's a good betting race to kick off the pick four.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Robby Albarado. The jockey won with six of his first 17
mounts at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Howard Tesher. The New York-based trainer is five of
122 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling B.Z. Jones in the
fourth, using Desiraes My Candy, Last Tango and Onaccountofyou in the
fifth and Bluesthestandard, Olmodavor and Freedom Crest in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/68. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $15.20/$396.40. Total money bet: $458.</TE>

<KH>KING REPORT</KH>
<HD>Players Give Murray Disciplined Response</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before the Kings left Los Angeles to start their trip for games
Tuesday and Wednesday at Nashville and Dallas, Coach Andy Murray was
concerned about his team's focus.</LD>
<LD>   But Murray didn't want his players looking back at the Kings'
consecutive home defeats by Nashville and Columbus. He didn't want
them to think about the four power-play goals they'd given up or the
lone power-play goal they'd managed to score.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Murray wanted his players thinking about discipline. He
talked to them about ill-advised retaliatory penalties and playing
within the system. But most of all, he talked about individual
responsibility.</LD>
<TE>   "We have to have discipline as individuals to be prepared for
every game on the ice, no matter how we are used," Murray said before
the trip. "If we miss a shift or whatever, we have to stay involved
and not show poor body language ... we have to try and contribute in
terms of the team."</TE>
<TE>   Murray's strategy must have worked. The Kings returned to Los
Angeles early Thursday with shutout victories over the Predators and
Stars.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' once struggling special teams are on a roll. In the
wins, they scored three power-play goals and did not give up a goal
in 15 short-handed situations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It shouldn't be such a surprise to see the Kings getting things
back together, now that center Jason Allison is back in the lineup
and playing on a line with Ziggy Palffy and Adam Deadmarsh.</TE>
<TE>   Allison made it back five weeks ahead of schedule after tearing
one knee ligament and stretching another. He has played five games
since his return.</TE>
<TE>   Allison scored his first goal since his injury in the Kings' 3-0
victory over Dallas on Wednesday, which featured three goals and
eight points from his line.</TE>
<TE>   Because of injuries, the line of Deadmarsh, Allison and Palffy has
been intact for only six of the Kings' 28 games but has accounted for
26 points -- 11 by Allison and 10 by Palffy. The breakdown: 11 goals
and 15 assists.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Qualifying for the $1,313,700 Los Alamitos Million may have been more
difficult for Meteoric than winning California's richest race of 2002
will be for the Idaho-bred.</LD>
<LD>   Running over a sloppy track that produced slower times after a
downpour earlier in the evening, the 2-year-old gelding earned his
way into the field of 10 with a facile victory in the ninth and final
trial Nov. 29. Among those who didn't qualify were All American
Futurity winner AB What A Runner and Kindergarten and Ed Burke winner
Morning Snow.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by the Dutch Masters III partnership of Doug Benson, Denny
Boer and James Streelman and trained by Lin Melton, Meteoric will be
odds-on to win for the ninth time in 10 starts in the 400-yard
Million.</LD>
<TE>   Half of his opponents are trained by John Bassett, the American
Quarter Horse Assn. champion. Bassett, who won the first running of
the Million with Evening Snow in 1995, will send out The Blues Man,
Lotta Bang, Xterra, Corona Caliente and First Place Queen.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Memorable Edition. 2. Flying Jeb. 3. Hustle Hustle
Hustle. 4. Departure Time. 5. Lotsalacy. 6. Big Mouth. 7. The Royal
Music. 8. Meteoric. 9. Ashley Budd. 10. Scr Proudest Target.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Memorable Edition, Diamond On Her Mind and Mr Chen in
the first, single Flying Jeb in the second, use Hustle Hustle Hustle
and the She Storms-Poza entry in the third and Departure Time,
Expocito and Deal 'Em Jack in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Cal Bred Prince steps up in search of a repeat
in the sixth after being claimed by trainer Santiago Rodriguez.
Smokin Colonel Jim should improve in his second local start in the
seventh.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wes Walz had a goal and an assist as the Minnesota Wild beat the
Detroit Red Wings, 3-2, Thursday night at Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   "They bend, but they don't break," Red Wing Darren McCarty said.</LD>
<LD>   Minnesota, unbeaten in four games, tied Dallas atop the Western
Conference with 39 points. The Red Wings, fourth in the West with 37
points, had a five-game unbeaten streak end.</LD>
<TE>   The Wild scored twice in the second period to take a 3-1 lead.
"We, as a team believe we can beat anybody. That's how we play," Wild
goalie Dwayne Roloson said.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus 4, New Jersey 2 -- Andrew Cassels had a goal and an
assist, and Marc Denis stopped 40 shots at Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   The goal gave Columbus 31 power-play goals this season. Last
season, the Blue Jackets didn't pick up their 31st goal with a man
advantage until Jan. 30.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 5, Pittsburgh 2 -- Mike Ricci tipped Bryan Marchment's
slap shot into the net with four minutes left as the Sharks overcame
two goals by Mario Lemieux at San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 3, Montreal 2 -- Brad Richards had three points,
including an assist on Martin St. Louis' 17th goal with 5:52
remaining in the third period at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 2, Toronto 1 -- Simon Gagne and Eric Desjardins
scored 1:02 apart midway through the third period at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 5, Boston 2 -- Todd White scored a short-handed goal and
assisted on another score that keyed Ottawa's four-goal second period
at Boston.</TE>

<KH>FLINT, Mich.</KH>
<HD>Empowerment Is Her Gospel Truth</HD>
<DH>Former USC basketball star Paula McGee is now a Baptist
preacher who says her mission is to help women improve lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>

<LD>FLINT, Mich. -- Paula McGee, svelte and with the right color thing
going on in makeup and clothes, trendy eyeglasses sitting in just the
right place on her nose, and the aplomb of Loretta Young in her walk
and movements, is a preacher. A darn good-looking Baptist preacher.</LD>
<LD>   Her mission, she says, is not just to save souls, but to help God
empower them. Women's souls.</LD>
<LD>   "What I've found is this -- if you change the life of a woman, you
change the life of her community, and if you change the life of her
community, you change the world," she says.</LD>
<TE>   Known as Rev. McGee, lives in Nashville. She preaches in various
churches and, as president of Paula McGee Ministries, conducts
workshops and makes public speaking appearances, encouraging women
with a message titled, "Accepting Your Greatness." Her agent is
shopping her book about that.</TE>
<TE>   McGee, 40, has never married, but doesn't rule it out. She has two
master's degrees, of divinity and arts in religion, and is applying
to a doctorate program.</TE>
<TE>   At a speaking engagement here last month, McGee seemed confident
and calm as she delivered her message in a witty yet straightforward
way.</TE>
<TE>   Her message was serious. She wondered aloud why, on Sept. 10,
2001, there was little money available for breast cancer research,
for battling domestic violence or to help single women with small
children, yet two days later $40 million was pledged to fight
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to define terror because there are women who are in
terror every day," McGee says. "The No. 1 killer for a lot of women
is somebody that they know; it's called domestic violence."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking before about 150 women, she seemed sure of herself, but
that confidence wasn't always there, she says. In college, she was
often lonely. Her junior year at USC was extremely successful
athletically, and seemingly otherwise. Her team had won the national
championship and she was engaged to Darryl Strawberry, who was
supposed to be baseball's next Ted Williams.</TE>
<TE>   The following summer, though, she failed to make the U.S. team for
the Pan American Games. She was tired, she said, and wasn't there
mentally.</TE>
<TE>   One weekend when she should have been training, she hung out with
Michael Jordan. She turned to Strawberry to rescue her, but that
relationship worsened. Then, in the loudness of the loneliness, she
says, she heard God's voice. McGee was called to be a minister.</TE>
<TE>   "And what I want to talk with you about tonight is accepting your
greatness," she says to the women at the speaking engagement. "When
it's time for me to say goodbye, and I'm put in the box, I can
promise you I will have a big smile on my face because I will have
used all of my gifts, I will have exploited my gifts, there will be
no woulda shoulda coulda, I wish I might have.... "</TE>

<LD>Austria and Switzerland were selected Thursday as co-hosts of the
2008 European Championship, edging out six rivals in the bid to stage
international soccer's second-most important event.</LD>
<LD>   The tournament will be played in the Austrian cities of Innsbruck,
Klagenfurt, Salzburg and Vienna, and in the Swiss cities of Basel,
Berne, Geneva and Zurich. Vienna will host the opening ceremony and
the final.</LD>
<LD>   Austria has never staged a major international soccer tournament
and Switzerland has not done so since hosting the 1954 World Cup.</LD>
<TE>   "This was the most positive decision for Austrian football in the
past 30, 40 or even 50 years," said Austria's coach, Hans Krankl. "It
is the best thing that could happen, simply wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   It took the executive committee of UEFA, European soccer's ruling
body, four hours to select Austria and Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   Hungary finished second in the voting and a joint bid by Greece
and Turkey was third.</TE>
<TE>   Failing in their efforts were joint bids from Ireland-Scotland and
Bosnia-Croatia, a four-way Nordic bid by Denmark, Finland, Norway and
Sweden, and a solitary bid by Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Portugal will stage the 2004 European Championship.</TE>
<TE>   World Cup 2006</TE>
<TE>   Africa's soccer leaders reversed course and decided that the 2006
African Nations Cup in Egypt would not serve as qualifying for the
World Cup in Germany later that year as they had previously agreed
upon.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Confederation of African Football, meeting in Cairo,
settled on a two-tier qualifying system that will allow 16 of the
continent's 52 nations a bye into the second qualifying round.</TE>
<TE>   USA Winners</TE>
<TE>   Aly Wagner, Santa Clara University and United States women's
national team midfielder, and forward Alecko Eskandarian of the
University of Virginia were named winners of the Missouri Athletic
Club's Hermann Trophy as college soccer's outstanding players for
2002.</TE>
<TE>   FIFA Decision</TE>
<TE>   An agreement was reached between FIFA, world's soccer's governing
body, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne,
Switzerland, that gives CAS final jurisdiction over all soccer
disputes except those concerning interpretation of the rules of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   Sepp Blatter, FIFA's president, called the agreement "a
significant step toward resolving the regrettable proliferation of
disputes in the world of football."</TE>
<TE>   Mexican Semifinals</TE>
<TE>   Morelia scored a convincing 4-0 home victory over UNAM on Thursday
night in front of 42,000 at Estadio Morelos in the first game of a
two-game Mexican championship playoff semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Goals by Adolfo Bautista in the 14th and 61st minutes led the way
for the Monarcos, who also saw Javier Saavedra and Alex Fernandes
score in the 30th and 43rd minutes, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The second game of the series is Sunday at the Estadio Olimpico
Universitario Mexico 68 in Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo, Etc.</TE>
<TE>   International soccer's leading English-language magazine, World
Soccer, selected Real Madrid striker Ronaldo as its player of the
year, Dutchman Guus Hiddink as its coach of the year and Brazil as
its team of the year for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo beat out Bayern Munich and Germany midfielder Michael
Ballack and Real Madrid and Brazil defender Roberto Carlos for the
honor, which he also won in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Hiddink, who led South Korea to the World Cup semifinals, was
chosen ahead of Brazil's World Cup-winning coach Luiz Felipe Scolari
and Frenchman Arsene Wenger, who led Arsenal to the English Premier
League and FA Cup "double."</TE>
<TE>   European champion Real Madrid finished second in the
team-of-the-year voting and Arsenal was third.</TE>

<HD>Long Says Toledo Will Bounce Back</HD>
<DH>New Mexico coach says his longtime friend is 'not
depressed, just diappointed' about his firing at UCLA</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Interim UCLA Coach Ed Kezirian posed stiffly with an Elvis
impersonator and two showgirls.</LD>
<LD>   Bruin Athletic Director Dan Guerrero took time away from his
coaching search to enjoy penne arrabatia with Rudy Davalos, his
counterpart at New Mexico and a longtime friend, at an Italian
restaurant in New York-New York Hotel &amp; Casino.</LD>
<LD>   And New Mexico Coach Rocky Long lamented that the dismissal of his
good friend Bob Toledo will deprive them of hanging out in Sin City
in the days before the Las Vegas Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   A news conference Wednesday promoting the game between UCLA and
New Mexico on Christmas Day was rife with reminders of the
uncertainty hanging over the Bruin program since Toledo was fired
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a proverb: May you live in interesting times," Kezirian
said. "Right now, these are interesting times at UCLA."</TE>
<TE>   Long, the UCLA defensive coordinator in 1996 and 1997, has talked
with Toledo twice this week. The Bruin coach has not commented
publicly being dismissed despite a 7-5 record this season and a 49-32
mark in his seven-year tenure.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not depressed, just disappointed," Long said. "He still
believes this is his football team and he wishes he could continue
because of all the young players.</TE>
<TE>   "In his mind, he still believes he should be the coach."</TE>
<TE>   Long believes Toledo, 56, will get back to work either as a head
coach or offensive coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   "Knowing Coach Toledo, he loves to coach," he said. "Given the
right opportunity, he'll coach again. But he'll take some time and be
selective."</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero is taking the same approach to finding a replacement for
him. The athletic director returned to UCLA after the news conference
and is scheduled to remain on campus today.</TE>
<TE>   He might want to devote a portion of his time to generating
interest in the game. UCLA has sold far fewer than the 4,000 sold by
New Mexico to date.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate sponsors in Albuquerque are paying for free tickets and
bus rides to Las Vegas for full-time Lobo students. About 400 have
taken advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "We should bring in 6,000-8,000 fans," Long said. "Our corporate
people have really stepped up."</TE>

<HD>Changed Bruins Reach Semifinals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Much has changed in the year since the UCLA men's soccer team last
went to Dallas for the NCAA final four.</LD>
<LD>   There is a new coach. There is a new attitude. And now there's a
chance to win another national championship.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins will attempt just that when they play Maryland in the
NCAA College Cup today at Gerald J. Ford Stadium on the campus of
Southern Methodist University. Creighton (18-3-2) plays Stanford
(17-4-2) in the other semifinal; the winners meet Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   It is UCLA's 11th appearance in the national semifinals and first
in three years. But it is the first under Tom Fitzgerald, a former
Major League Soccer coach hired in March to succeed Todd Saldana.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins (16-3-3) put themselves in position for their fourth
national title by avoiding the pitfalls that have plagued the
talented squads of the last two seasons. In 2000, UCLA was 8-0 and
ranked No. 1 before losing seven of its final 11. Last year, it
started 6-6-2 before salvaging its season with a 6-1-2 finish and a
long run in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   This season, the Bruins have followed their three losses with
victories and haven't lost in more than a month. The consistency
resulted in a high national ranking throughout the season and a No. 3
seeding in the NCAA tournament, which allowed them to stay at home
until this point.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a couple of bad games, which we lost, but we recovered
from them," Fitzgerald said. "I never want them to think about those
losses. To me, they were in the past."</TE>
<TE>   Senior forward Tim Pierce said Fitzgerald's easygoing demeanor has
complemented an experienced squad that went through the
disappointments of the last two years. UCLA lost to Southern
Methodist in the quarterfinals last season and was bounced out of the
playoffs in the first round two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He's made a lot of difference," Pierce said. "He gives us a lot
of direction and he makes it clear what your role is here. He makes
everyone as happy as they can be." UCLA has been on a scoring tear in
the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   In victories over Loyola Marymount, California and Penn State, the
Bruins have scored 14 goals, the most of any of the four teams
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   They have 17 goals in their last four matches.</TE>
<TE>   They'll play a Maryland team that became a national power under
Sasho Cirovski. Cirovski, a former assistant under onetime U.S.
national team coach Bob Gansler at Wisconsin Milwaukee, has led the
Terrapins (20-4-0) to a No. 1 ranking at the end of the regular
season and their first final four appearance since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Hermann Trophy finalist Sumed Ibrahim has seven goals and six
assists.</TE>
<TE>   Abe Thompson (14 goals, eight assists) and Domenic Mediate (13
goals, five assists) are the leading scorers.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland hasn't given up a goal in the tournament and has a
shutout streak spanning 372 minutes.</TE>

<HD>Dupree's Time Is Coming</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As he made his way to the USC bench for the second half of the
Trojans' victory over Cal State Fullerton on Wednesday night, Coach
Henry Bibby spied Jerry Dupree standing near the baseline and pulled
the suspended junior forward close to him.</LD>
<LD>   For a few tense seconds, Bibby spoke at Dupree, not with him,
before the one-sided conversation ended with exchanged smiles and
handshakes.</LD>
<LD>   "He was just telling me that the team was waiting on me, to hurry
up and get back" said Dupree, who, with his six-game suspension
coming to an end, joined the Trojans in the locker room afterward for
the first time this season.</LD>
<TE>   Dupree was expected to be a major contributor after a breakout
performance last spring in the Pacific 10 Conference tournament. But
he had academic trouble over the summer. When he was put on academic
probation for the fall semester, in danger of being ineligible for
the spring, Bibby suspended Dupree to help him concentrate on his
studies.</TE>
<TE>   "Out of three classes, I need above a C [average] to get back to
where I need to be and not worry about this probation thing," said
Dupree, who took classes in journalism and dance and has a geography
final on Monday. He's also waiting for the end of final exams before
beginning practice with the team, should his grade-point average
allow it.</TE>
<TE>   Hobbled by a sore right heel since practice began in mid-October,
Dupree was cleared this week to begin light workouts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With only one game left until the start of the Pac-10 season Jan.
2, the respite couldn't have come at a better time for two injured
Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   Junior center Jonathan Oliver was diagnosed Thursday with a high
left ankle sprain and will undergo more tests. Senior point guard
Robert Hutchinson aggravated his sprained right ankle against
Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   USC plays host to La Salle on Dec. 21.</TE>

<LD>Give the USC women's volleyball team an A.</LD>
<LD>   For ace.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans' first point and their second-to-last one came on
aces, and, with nine more in between, USC all but served Michigan
State off the court in a 30-17, 30-23, 30-15 sweep of the Spartans in
an NCAA west regional semifinal match Thursday night at UC Santa
Barbara.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought our team brought their A game," USC Coach Mick Haley
said. "Our serving was exceptional, and I thought we fired on all
cylinders."</TE>
<TE>   The top-seeded Trojans (28-1) started strong and finished not only
with the 11 aces, but also an exceptional three-game hitting
percentage of .454.</TE>
<TE>   The victory, USC's ninth in a row since its loss to Stanford on
Nov. 2, sends the Trojans into the regional championship match at 7
tonight against ninth-seeded Pepperdine (26-6), a 30-22, 30-23,
25-30, 30-19 winner over UC Santa Barbara (30-3).</TE>
<TE>   USC used its superior depth and strength to sink unseeded Michigan
State (21-12) with different players in each game.</TE>
<TE>   "We have so many hitters, you can't really adapt to it in each
game," said USC outside hitter April Ross, who had a match-high 11
kills. "If we bring our A game, that's all we have to do."</TE>
<TE>   In Pepperdine's victory, Katie Wilkins had 11 kills and Breegan
Mulligan had eight kills and seven digs as the Waves advanced to a
regional championship game for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine has won 17 consecutive matches since a three-game loss
to USC on Oct. 8.</TE>

<LD>Many players from USC's two-time national championship team would
prove to be successful off the court, too.</LD>
<LD>   One of the more impressive post-basketball resumes belongs to
guard Melissa Ward, a walk-on, who became an Air Force pilot and now
works for United Airlines. She is one of eight African American
female pilots for the airline, and the first and only African
American female flight captain for a major passenger airline.</LD>
<LD>   "I wasn't trying to be the 'first' anything," Ward said. "I've
been fortunate to be in the right place in the right time."</LD>
<TE>   After graduating from USC in 1986, Ward attended the pilot school
at Reese Air Force Base in Lubbock, Texas. Upon completing her
training, she became the school's first African American female
flight instructor, and trained pilots for the Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   She was hired by United in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Other players from the 1983 and 1984 title teams include:</TE>

First Victoria National Bank in Cuero, Texas;</TE>
